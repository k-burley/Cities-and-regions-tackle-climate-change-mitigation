While there is widespread agreement that continued efforts to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change are paramount, there is growing interest in “climate intervention” or “geoengineering” approaches, including those that reduce global warming by reflecting sunlight to cool Earth. In a workshop held in September 2019, the National Academies convened experts to inform a larger study on solar geoengineering. Workshop participants discussed the governance of research at international, national, and sub-national scales and explored research governance mechanisms that might be applied to climate intervention research.

The combination analysis across spatial resolutions, which is rare, helps explore the comprehensive relationship between urban fragmentation and CO2 emissions. This study compared the relationships between urban form fragmentation and CO2 emissions in an urban system through the analytic framework composed of the Pearson correlation analysis, geographically weighted regression (GWR), and geographical detector methods with the use of multi-source data to construct the CO2 emissions maps. As the result, there was less fragmentation with a 500-m spatial resolution (R500m) than with a 30-m spatial resolution (R30m). In terms of the GWR analysis, the coarse resolution resulted in: 1) positive coefficients of fragmentation metric becoming negative, and 2) greater absolute values of negative coefficients. As to the results of Geographical detector, single factor impact powers and interactions among fragmentation factors showed a weakening effect at R30m, but a strengthening and weakening effect at R500m. However, there were common results observed in low-fragmented areas across different scales. That is, in low-fragmented mixed-function areas and industrial areas, the more fragmented the area was, the less the CO2 emission there would be. However, in low-fragmented residential, administrative and public service areas, the more fragmented the area was, the higher the CO2 emission there would be. Therefore, the government should disperse the mixed function zones and industrial parcels with diverse types of land, and build the contiguous residential and public service land in the low fragmentation area of urban system. The results of this study can provide a reference for the other small and medium towns and cities. The analytical framework can be applied to CO2 emissions research in urban agglomerations, megacities, and small towns. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aggregation effect; Fossil fuel CO2 emission; Spatial analysis; Spatial resolution; Urban functional landscape","Carbon dioxide; Correlation methods; Fossil fuels; Housing; Image resolution; Industrial emissions; CO2 emissions; Geographically weighted regression; Pearson correlation analysis; Positive coefficients; Spatial analysis; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial resolution; Urban functional landscape; Spatial variables measurement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073714604

The complex climate-fire-ecosystem interactions were not fully integrated in previous climate model studies, and the resulting effects on the projections of future climate change are not well understood. Here we use the fully interactive REgion-Specific ecosystem feedback Fire model (RESFire) that was developed in the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to investigate these interactions and their impacts on climate systems and fire activity. We designed two sets of decadal simulations using CESM-RESFire for present-day (2001-2010) and future (2051-2060) scenarios, respectively, and conducted a series of sensitivity experiments to assess the effects of individual feedback pathways among climate, fire, and ecosystems. Our implementation of RESFire, which includes online land-atmosphere coupling of fire emissions and fire-induced land cover change (LCC), reproduces the observed aerosol optical depth (AOD) from space-based Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite products and ground-based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) data; it agrees well with carbon budget benchmarks from previous studies.

(Arecales: Arecaceae) and other palms. The invasion of B. longissima causes major economic and ecological losses worldwide. In this study, the impacts of climate change on the risk of spread were evaluated. CLIMEX was used to project its global potential distribution based on historical climate data (1987–2016) and simulated future climate data (2071–2100). RESULTS: The distribution of B. longissima included each continent under historical and future climate conditions. However, climate suitability was predicted to decrease in most tropical and subtropical regions under a climate change scenario. Temperature was a more important determinant of the climatic suitability of the pest than relative humidity or precipitation. The availability of host plants (Arecaceae) only had a slight impact on climate suitability in some regions. CONCLUSION: The projected potential distribution of B. longissima will help to determine the impacts of climate change and will provide supportive information for the development of management strategies to reduce future economic and ecological losses. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry","climate change; CLIMEX; potential distribution; RCP4.5","beetle; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; geographical distribution; host plant; management practice; monocotyledon; precipitation (climatology); relative humidity; tropical region; Arecaceae; Arecales; Brontispa longissima; Chrysomelidae; Cocos nucifera; Coleoptera; animal; beetle; climate change; coconut; ecology; Animals; Climate Change; Cocos; Coleoptera; Ecology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068621354

Characterized by predominant planetary waves of zonal wave 2, the SSW developed into a vortex split via wave-mean flow interaction. In the following two weeks, the downward migration of zonal-mean zonal wind anomalies was accompanied by a significant transition to the negative phase of the North Atlantic Oscillation, leading to extensive cold extremes across Europe. Here, we demonstrate that anomalous Siberian snow accumulation could have played an important role in the 2018 SSW occurrence. In the 2017/18 winter, snow depths over Siberia were much higher than normal. A lead-lag correlation analysis shows that the positive fluctuating snow depth anomalies, leading to intensified ''cold domes'' over eastern Siberia (i.e., in a region where the climatological upward planetary waves maximize), precede enhanced wave-2 pulses of meridional heat fluxes (100 hPa) by 7-8 days. The snow-SSW linkage over 2003-19 is further investigated, and some common traits among three split events are found. These include a time lag of about one week between the maximum anomalies of snow depth and wave-2 pulses (100 hPa), high sea level pressure favored by anomalous snowpack, and a ridge anchoring over Siberia as precursor of the splits. The role of tropospheric ridges over Alaska and the Urals in the wave-2 enhancement and the role of Arctic sea ice loss in Siberian snow accumulation are also discussed. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.

Fe3O4/WHB facilitated the conversion of CO2 to methane and reduce H2 production. A higher coenzyme F420 concentration of 1.32 μmol/(g-mixed liquor volatile suspended solids) was found with the presence of Fe3O4/WHB, which might result in a faster conversion of acetate to methane. More interspecific signal molecules, lower diffusible signal factor, and higher mean particle size indicated that Fe3O4/WHB accelerated the sludge granulation process.

Therefore, CO2 sequestration has been an indispensable area of research for the past several decades. On the other hand, the concept of aromaticity is often employed in designing chemical reactions and metal-free frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) have proved ideal reagents to achieve CO2 reduction. However, considering FLP and aromaticity together is less developed in CO2 capture. Here we report theoretical investigations on the aromaticity-promoted CO2 activation, involving heterocyclopentadiene-bridged P/N-FLPs. The calculations reveal that furan- and pyrrole-bridged P/N-FLPs can make CO2 capture both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable (with activation energies of 5.4–7.7 kcal mol−1) due to the aromatic stabilization of the transition states and products. Our findings could open an avenue to the design of novel FLPs for CO2 capture. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

To address this challenge, a novel “adaptive full-range decoupled ventilation strategy” (ADV strategy) is proposed, which incorporates the advantages of different operation modes and offers energy-efficient operation. In this paper, the energy and economic performance as well as the recommended operation modes of the ADV strategy are investigated under different climatic conditions. The energy performance of a typical pharmaceutical cleanroom air-conditioning system is evaluated by simulation tests in nine cities in five typical climate zones. The test results show that adopting the ADV strategy can achieve 6.8–40.8% energy savings compared with that of a most commonly used existing ventilation strategy. Dedicated outdoor air ventilation (DV) is recommended as the main mode of the ADV strategy in severe cold/cold/moderate climate zones while the following sensible load (FS) is recommended as the main economizer mode in hot/temperate climate zones. For existing system retrofits and new system designs, the payback periods are less than 4 years and 2 years respectively in most climates when the ADV strategy is fully implemented. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air-conditioning; Cleanroom; Design; Energy conservation; Retrofitting; Ventilation strategy","Air conditioning; Clean rooms; Design; Energy conservation; Humidity control; Investments; Laboratories; Neonatal monitoring; Retrofitting; Systems analysis; Ventilation; Climatic conditions; Conditioning systems; Design and operations; Economic performance; Energy efficient operations; Outdoor air ventilation; Temperature and humidity control; Ventilation strategy; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072314585

These are to take the same carbon tax policy as the United States (that is $40 per ton of carbon tariffs) and differentiated tax policy (that is, the “common but differentiated responsibilities” and product competitiveness point of view, US imposes a $40 per ton carbon tax on domestic products, while China imposes a $9 per ton tax on domestic products). Setting four specific policy scenarios (the United States takes a carbon tax collection only on products that are produced from their own country; the United States imposes a carbon tax both on domestic products and on products exported from China; China and the United States adopt the same carbon tax policy for their own domestic products; and China and the United States adopt differentiated carbon tax policies for their own domestic products), this study uses an Energy-Environmental Version of the Global Trade Analysis Project model (GTAP-E) to explore whether China's active emission reduction can be an effective choice to deal with the US carbon tariff threat. The results of the research showed a 1.4% fall in China's GDP resulting from a $40 per ton of carbon tariff on Chinese products although such move by China is to avoid carbon tariffs on China's exports to the United States. This adverse economic effects thus makes this method an ineffective way of dealing with the threats. When China imposes a carbon tax of $9 per ton on domestic products, China's real GDP and residents' welfare decline but are effectively controlled, and the world's total carbon dioxide emissions also reduce considerably. Therefore, in this way, China can effectively deal with the threat of US carbon tariffs. This paper applies the GTAP-E model to refine the research different from existing research on model building. It analyzes the change of China's economy, carbon dioxide, and industry output and import under the different situations. This will help take reasonable measures in our country when dealing with the carbon tariffs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Carbon tariff; Differentiated carbon tax policy; GTAP-E model; Low carbon economy; Sino-US trade","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Emission control; Global warming; Renewable energy resources; Taxation; Carbon emissions; Carbon tariffs; Carbon taxes; E-Model; Low carbon economy; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072779322

This study proposes a methodology that fuses three auxiliary strategies into the Kidney Algorithm (KA) to optimize the hydropower output for conquering the bottlenecks in the KA concerning the joint operation of six mega cascade reservoirs located in the Jin-Sha River basin in China. The proposed theme would contribute to the application of the state-of-the-art evolutionary algorithms in boosting the cleaner hydropower production of mega cascade reservoirs. The three auxiliary strategies are that: firstly, the exploration and exploitation strategy is employed to stimulate the movement of solutions to surmount technical drawback of trapping into a local optimum; secondly, the adaptive strategy is used to automatically adjust algorithm parameter values to overcome the instability problem; lastly, the elitism strategy is introduced to preserve the best solution at every epoch to avoid the loss of good solutions. Our methodology, without expanding or upgrading hydraulic infrastructures, can increase the hydropower production of the six mega cascade reservoirs by 7.8%, as compared with the standard operation policy. The hydropower production can reach 4.8 billion kW·h/year, which can decrease 3.77 billion kg/year in CO2 emission, and bring 217.44 million USD/year in hydropower benefits. The improved KA can considerably increase the reliability and resilience of hydropower output as well as largely decrease the vulnerability of hydropower output. The results suggest that our methodology can stimulate hydropower output to yield more benefits regarding cleaner production, carbon emission reduction and sustainability. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Artificial intelligence (AI); Cascade reservoirs; Hydropower production; Jin-sha river; Optimal operation; Water-energy nexus","Emission control; Evolutionary algorithms; Hydroelectric power; Carbon emission reductions; Cascade reservoirs; Exploration and exploitation; Fast convergence rate; Hydro power production; Instability problems; Optimal operation; Water energy; Reservoirs (water)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073095124

Aiming at this issue, a multi-objective mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model is proposed to minimize the total economic costs and CO2 emission simultaneously. Various actual process and technical constraints including pipeline construction, pump stations layout, pipeline hydraulic and pumps configurations are considered in the model.

This study presents a demand-side decomposition of China's carbon intensity to its regions, final demand types, and economic sectors, based on a predefined “aggregate embodied intensity (AEI)” indicator, i.e. the ratio of embodied emissions to embodied value added. We find that China's carbon intensity has been largely shaped by developed provinces, capital investment demand, and the construction sector. However, less-developed provinces, consumption demand, and the services sector have played increasingly important roles. Wealthy provinces generally experienced much lower AEIs and higher AEI reductions compared to poor provinces from 2007 to 2012, mainly owing to provincial differences in final demand structure and sectoral structure. Coastal region's emission reduction efforts at both production and demand sides were the main contributor to China's decrease in carbon intensity during the period, while interior region's structural degradation in demand partially offset the decrease. Our results suggest that allocating national carbon intensity targets based on AEI, and adjusting the final demand structure of central-western provinces, would greatly benefit for China to achieve its ambitious carbon intensity target by 2030. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Aggregate embodied intensity; Demand-side analysis; Multi-regional input-output analysis; National carbon intensity; Structural decomposition analysis","Aggregates; Construction industry; Economic analysis; Emission control; Investments; Carbon intensity; Construction sectors; Decomposition analysis; Demand-side; Input output analysis; Reduction potential; Structural decomposition analysis; Structural degradation; Carbon; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; demand analysis; economic growth; emission control; input-output analysis; investment; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076002614

Based on a multi-region input-output (MRIO) analysis, this paper uses Shanghai’s 30 industrial sectors as a case to estimate 2007 carbon emissions embodied in domestic and international trade, so as to unravel sectoral and regional sources of emissions embodied in Shanghai’s domestic imports and exports, and to compare consumption-based and production-based emission accounting approaches. The MRIO framework implemented here overcomes many modeling and data limitations encountered in the existing literature, which provides more reliable and more disaggregated estimates in support of climate policy-making. We also discuss a policy option that potentially reduces the incidence of trade on the emissions of regional economies in the study area. One finding from this study is that Shanghai’s carbon emissions embodied in domestic trade with Chinese provinces are 82.60 million tons, which accounts for 50.67% of Shanghai’s overall emissions in 2007. In addition, the embodied emissions of import sources of Shanghai are mainly located in Northern and North Central China, while those of export flows are primarily observed in the coastal provinces of Eastern China. Another important finding is that, owing to the large scale of Shanghai’s EET, the incidence of inter-regional trade is largely curtailed if Shanghai participates in a coalition with neighboring provinces, instead of as an individual region. Therefore, the study suggests that one way to shield domestic trade from the stringent requirements of a national climate policy while preserving the economic benefits of inter-regional trade may be to encourage coalition formation in the Yangtze River Delta to boost cooperation around the Shanghai megacity. Therefore, we advocate a more regional approach to climate change and emissions mitigation policies. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Carbon emissions accounting principle; Input-output analysis; Mega-regions; Urban economy",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089330125

This growth has led to high levels of curtailment of RES power due to insufficient reinforcement of the electricity grid to support such growth and due to competition with other power sources. Although the problem of curtailment has been alleviated in recent years, large amounts of power are still discarded, and it is important to consider how to address this problem in the short term and how much CO2e emissions could be avoided as a result. The use of district heating systems to reduce the curtailment of renewable power has seen increasing interest in recent years. Based on a review of potential energy storage in district heating, the current paper assesses the capability to use the national storage potential of district heating systems in China to reduce curtailment and to determine what effects that may have on avoiding CO2e emissions. The distribution networks and the thermal inertia of buildings connected to district heating are considered as two major forms of storage that can be “charged” using power that would otherwise be curtailed. The results show that there may be sufficient storage available to absorb all renewable power that is currently curtailed in those provinces using district heating during the heating season, resulting in avoided emissions of up to 14 MtCO2e/annum.

Then, incentive policies of PEV adoption are explored at the provincial level in China. Approximately 70% of the total PEV model sales have lower all-electric ranges and battery capacity than average in the top 5 provinces that have sold the most battery electric vehicles (BEVs) or plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs). Sales by make and model in these top 5 provinces are used to estimate ronal electricity consumption, gasoline replacement and carbon dioxide reductions. From 2011 to 2017, 682,047 PEVs have been sold in the 5 provinces, with 18.3 billion electric vehicle kilometers traveled (VKT). 3.0 TWh of electricity were consumed, reducing gasoline consumption by 1.6 billion liters and CO2 emissions by 611,824 tons. Approximately 70% of the total gasoline replacement and 80% of the total CO2 emissions reduction were contributed by BEVs.

However, there are many disadvantages in a carbon market, owing to various designs and policies still under trial and implementation. Adopting the multi-agents technique, we constructed a framework about national carbon market to estimate the effect of a different design of policy made on the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and environment. In particular, national and regional abatement policies were analyzed in our study. The results showed the carbon-trading mechanism can effectively reduce carbon emissions and make a negative impact on GDP. National abatement can neither be too high nor too low for reducing carbon emissions and maintaining economic stability. For different regions, the central region was impacted the most by a carbon trading mechanism, and the east region was the opposite. Moreover, the “sweeping approach” policy should be replaced by a regional “discriminating policy” because the abatement requirement to the western region was low and to the eastern region was relatively high, which is more beneficial to China’s regional development. © 2020 by the authors.

At the partial equilibrium level, commuting with three workers per automobile clearly reduces highway congestion, lowers carbon emissions, and saves energy compared with three single drivers. This paper develops a numerical urban simulation model to generate the general equilibrium effects of HOV lanes on urban spatial structure, energy use, and greenhouse gas emissions. The major findings are that while HOV lanes reduce traffic congestion and improve welfare, the fall in transportation cost leads to urban sprawl, which results in higher dwelling energy use and a larger carbon footprint. Overall, the HOV lane policy has little effect on total energy consumption and carbon emissions. This is another classic case of general equilibrium effects reversing the partial equilibrium effects of an urban policy. In contrast, a gasoline tax policy leads to less urban sprawl but is less effective at lowering energy consumption and carbon emissions. Imposing congestion tolls is a more effective tool at reducing traffic congestion, saving energy, and lowering carbon emissions. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","carbon emissions; energy consumption; gasoline tax; HOV lanes; optimal congestion toll","air quality; carbon emission; computer simulation; energy use; general equilibrium analysis; numerical model; policy analysis; pollution tax; traffic congestion; traffic management; transportation policy; urban sprawl",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063258769

The rhizosphere soils tend to be the hotspots of denitrification in agricultural soils. Recent studies have reported the important role of nosZ II in eliminating N2O. However, little was known about how these more recently discovered N2O-reducing microorganisms together with other N2O-producers affected the N2O emission in agricultural rhizosphere soils. Materials and methods: Here, we compared the potential N2O production rate, the denitrification end-product ratio, and the denitrifier communities between rhizosphere and non-rhizosphere soils of two types of crops in winter and summer. The potential activities were measured by acetylene inhibition technique. QPCR analysis was used to quantify the functional genes. High-throughput sequencing and clone library were conducted to analyze the community structure of denitrifiers. Results and discussion: The rhizosphere soils had a higher N2O production potential but lower denitrification end-product ratio (N2O/(N2O+N2)) than the non-rhizosphere soils. The potential N2O production rate was correlated to the nirS-bacteria abundance, especially in terms of the genus Azospirillum. The N2O/(N2O+N2) ratio showed a negative correlation with both the diversity and abundance of the nosZ II-type N2O-reducers. Conclusions: Altogether, we propose that nirS-type N2O-producers and nosZ II-type N2O-reducers can affect the N2O emission in agricultural rhizosphere soils, and enhancement of diversity and abundance of nosZ II-type N2O-reducers may help with the N2O mitigation from upland crops. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Farmland; N2O-producers; N2O-reducers; nosZ II; Rhizosphere soils","abundance; acetylene; agricultural emission; agricultural land; agricultural soil; bacterium; denitrification; inhibition; microbial community; nitrous oxide; polymerase chain reaction; reduction; rhizosphere; Azospirillum; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068941271

The results revealed great changes in pollutant discharge patterns due to manufacturing industrial transfer, with the pollution gravity centre and total discharge transferring from east to west. We also found indications of a delayed response between the movement of industry and a corresponding reduction in pollutant emissions. The modelling results suggested that differences in regional economy, technological innovation, industrial upgrading, and environmental regulation influenced observed changes in pollutant discharge patterns.

The utilization of active oxygen species for the direct conversion of methane to value-added products at moderate temperatures was investigated. The active oxygen sites for the selective conversion of methane were identified by a TPR feature at 220 °C. This site is also characterized by an infrared band observed at 1872 and 1892 cm-1 upon adsorption of NO. These bands are NO stretching vibrations of NO adsorbed on iron oxygen monomeric species, present in the zeolite cages and responsible for selective oxidation. We show that these oxidized species react with methane to form oxygenates but at higher temperatures form molecular oxygen. IR bands of surface methoxy groups were observed in significant concentration in the FTIR spectra and are suggested to be intermediate species of the selective oxidation of methane. Studies using continuous reactors demonstrated that cofeeding of methane and N2O-promoted generation of desired products from methane conversion by N2O over Fe-FER catalyst can be enhanced by optimizing the feed ratio of CH4/N2O. Furthermore, N2, O2 and NO were detected as the products of N2O decomposition over Fe-FER catalysts.

However, the laboratory evidence associated with the metabolic fate of nitrocompounds in the rumen has not been well documented. The present study was conducted to compare in vitro degradation and metabolism of nitroethane (NE), 2-nitroethanol (NEOH), and 2-nitro-1-propanol (NPOH) incubated with mixed rumen microorganisms of dairy cows. After 10 mM supplementation of nitrocompounds, a serious of batch cultures were carried out for 120 h under the presence of two substrates differing in the ratio of maize meal to alfalfa hay (HF, 1:4; LF, 4:1). Compared to the control, methane production was reduced by 59% in NPOH and by &gt;97% in both NE and NEOH, and such antimethanogenic effects were more pronounced in the LF than the HF group. Although NE, NEOH, and NPOH addition did not alter total VFA production, the rumen fermentation pattern shifted toward increasing propionate and butyrate and decreasing acetate production. The kinetic disappearance of each nitrocompound was well fitted to the one-compartment model, and the disappearance rate (k, %/h) of NE was 2.6 to 5.2 times greater than those of NEOH and NPOH. Higher intermediates of nitrite occurred in NEOH in comparison with NPOH and NE while ammonia N production was lowest in NEOH. Consequently, a stepwise accumulation of bacterial crude protein (BCP) in response to the nitrocompound addition was observed in both the HF and LF group. In brief, both NE and NEOH in comparison with NPOH presented greater antimethanogenic activity via the shift of rumen fermentation. In addition, the present study provided the first direct evidence that rumen microbes were able to cleave these nitrocompounds into nitrite, and the subsequent metabolism of nitrite into ammonia N may enhance the growth of rumen microbes or promote microbial activities. © 2019 by the authors.

Research has been conducted on various building structures; however, a comparison of the emissions from different structures requires further investigation, because the relevant previous studies usually adopted different design conditions and lacked consideration of parameter uncertainty. In this context, the present study applied process-based method to compare the embodied emissions of five structure systems, namely brick masonry, hollow block masonry, reinforced masonry, reinforced concrete frame, and reinforced concrete wall structures based on the same building layout for structural design and a unified system boundary for assessment. A case study was performed based on both deterministic and stochastic analyses, and the emissions and parameter uncertainty were assessed from the perspectives of processes, subprojects, and scopes. The results indicated that hollow block masonry structures could be a good option for buildings in non-seismic regions, considering their relatively low project costs and emissions. With respect to reinforced masonry and concrete structures, the difference in emissions and relative reliability were evaluated by a statistical analysis, and the results indicated that reinforced masonry and concrete frame structures rather than concrete wall structures were recommended for typical multistory buildings in seismic regions, from a comprehensive perspective of safety, costs, and emissions. Overall, the results and findings of this study could be helpful for emission reduction from the perspective of structural design. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building construction; Comparative analysis; Emission reduction; Structural alternative; Uncertainty analysis","Architectural design; Cost benefit analysis; Emission control; Reinforced concrete; Reliability analysis; Seismology; Stochastic systems; Structural analysis; Tall buildings; Walls (structural partitions); Building construction; Comparative analysis; Concrete frame structures; Emission reduction; Parameter uncertainty; Reinforced concrete frames; Reinforced concrete wall; Structural alternative; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072843855

In addition, we find that non-state-owned firms (non-SOEs) respond more strongly than SOEs. The findings remain qualitatively the same after accounting for selection bias in the cities included in the Coordination. Most importantly, air quality improves for treatment cities after the implementation of the Coordination.

Transport agencies everywhere in the world are focusing on mitigation strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Policy-makers are under pressure to tackle the issue of climate change and approach sustainable transport by promoting more sustainable practices and altering behavior. This paper attempts to explore the impact of transport on climate change through the lens of governance by establishing a systematic review framework. The results showed that developing nations should be influential in managing their public transport agencies to achieve economic transformation. They require a functional, reliable, and effective transport system and these can only be derived by properly formulated and implemented policies with the aid of all relevant private, academic, and government bodies working together. This study concluded that developing nations need to manage their pricing methods, using them to facilitate transport systems that are unlikely to affect the climate. To this end, transport policy and governance need to be reviewed to take into account climate change and natural disaster concerns. Additionally, guidelines and strategies should be proposed for every actor involved, i.e., transport community, top-level leaders, and all governmental levels and private sectors. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Governance; Greenhouse effect; Mitigation; Multi-level transport governance; Sustainable development","carbon emission; climate change; developing world; governance approach; greenhouse gas; natural disaster; policy implementation; policy making; public transport; strategic approach; sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079508615

In this work, we studied the global protein and metabolite changes of a Moorella thermoacetica-CdS (cadmium sulfide quantum dots) hybrid system during light harvesting. The Wood-Ljungdahl pathway (WLP) that has been considered as the main approach for CO2 fixation was found to be highly activated by CdS. Targeted metabolite quantification revealed that energy-metabolism-associated glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle were also activated. Therefore, we propose an energy-conservation scheme to the M. thermoacetica-CdS hybrid system, i.e., glycolysis and the TCA cycle along with the oxidation of acetyl-coenzyme A (CoA) and NADH, in addition to the well-documented chemiosmotic proton gradient-driven ATP production by ATPase.

Comparing the different scenarios, we found that (1) vehicle control policies will bring significant reductions in the emissions of primary pollutants. Among the individual policies, upgrading new vehicle emission standards and fuel quality in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei will be the most effective policy, with emission reductions of primary pollutants of 26.3%–54.7%, 38.0%–70.3% and 46.0%–81.6% in 2025, respectively; (2) for PM2.5 in winter, the Combined Scenario (CS) will lead to a reduction of 0.5–3.9 μg m−3 (3.5%–11.6%) for the monthly average PM2.5 concentrations in most areas. The monthly nitrate and ammonium concentrations would reduce by 5.8% and 5.3%, respectively, in the whole BTH region, indicating that vehicle emission control policies may play an important role in the reduction of PM2.5 concentrations in winter, especially for nitrate aerosols; and (3) for O3 concentrations in summer, vehicle emission control policies will lead to significant decreases. Under the CS scenario, the maximum reduction of monthly average O3 concentrations in the summer is approximately 3.6 ppb (5.9%). Most areas in the BTH region have a decrease of 15 ppb (7.5%) in peak values compared to the base scenario. However, in some VOC-sensitive areas in the BTH region, such as the southern urban areas, significant reductions in NOx may lead to increases in ozone concentrations. Our results highlight that season- and location-specific vehicle emission control measures are needed to alleviate ambient PM2.5 and O3 pollution effectively in this region due to the complex meteorological conditions and atmospheric chemical reactions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emission control policies; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Surface ozone (O3); Vehicle; WRF-Chem","ammonia; nitrate; ozone; assessment method; concentration (composition); emission control; ozone; particulate matter; pollution control; pollution policy; simulation; traffic emission; air pollution control; air quality; Article; China; environmental policy; exhaust gas; particulate matter; summer; urban area; winter; air pollutant; air pollution; China; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073941027

The β-convergence of pollutant emissions means regions with lower pollutant emissions should have higher growth rates in pollutant emissions and then eventually catch up with those with higher. To boost economic growth maximumly under the constraint of a certain amount of pollutant emission reduction, the β-convergence of pollutant emission intensity is an important rule to rely on when allocating pollutant emission control targets at Chinese provincial level. With Chinese province-level panel data for 2000 to 2014, this research uses appropriate spatial panel models to investigate the β-convergence in emission intensities of SO2 and COD. The results show that absolute β-convergence does not exist in either emission intensity of SO2 or emission intensity of COD, whereas conditional β-convergence exists for both pollutants. Positive spatial autocorrelation exists for both emission intensities of SO2 and COD, meaning the pollutant emission intensity of one province is positively related to those of its neighboring provinces. In addition, the conditional β-convergence trend is weaker when spatial autocorrelation of pollutant emission intensities is considered. The non-existence of absolute β-convergence inspires policy makers to improve China's environmental target responsibility system because further analysis shows that provinces with higher pollutant emission intensities were not allocated with higher pollutant emission reduction targets in practice. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical oxygen demand; Convergence; Environmental governance; Pollutant emission control; Spatial panel data models; Sulfur dioxide","Autocorrelation; Economics; Emission control; Sulfur dioxide; Convergence; Convergence analysis; Emission intensity; Environmental governances; Environmental targets; Pollutant emission control; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial panel data models; Chemical oxygen demand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072399145

This study provides a novel quantitative analysis of the global CO2 mitigation potential through accelerated carbon sequestration in concrete debris separated from construction and demolition waste. We consider the economic and environmental tradeoff. Based on data collection from 14 large regions and countries, we created a method to estimate and project the generation of concrete debris, recycling and carbonation rates, and cost. The overall concrete debris generation was more than 3.0 (±0.6) billion tonnes (Bt) in 2017 worldwide, mainly from emerging countries such as China and India. This debris has the potential to mitigate 62.5 (±8.9) million tonnes (Mt) CO2 under optimal carbonation conditions determined by pressure, temperature, humidity, time, CO2 concentration, and debris size. Our scenario analysis reveals that the global cumulative carbonation of concrete debris could be as high as 3.0 Bt CO2 between 2018 and 2035, which equals approximately one third of the total CO2 emissions from fuel combustion of China in 2016. In our scenarios, the economic benefits of storing CO2 by concrete debris are mainly from recycled concrete aggregate rather than carbon sequestration, but also consider the current carbon price in major carbon markets. These findings highlight an effective and practical approach to reuse concrete debris as well as enhancing economic benefits. This approach could be helpful to better manage the fast-growing concrete debris and need for carbon mitigation as well as bridging the gap of CO2 sequestration by concrete debris between research and application. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon mitigation; Concrete debris; Economic benefits; Tradeoff; Worldwide","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Concretes; Debris; Demolition; Digital storage; Economic and social effects; Forestry; Fuels; Recycling; Waste incineration; Carbon mitigation; CO2 emissions from fuel combustion; Construction and demolition waste; Economic benefits; Recycled concrete aggregates; Research and application; Tradeoff; Worldwide; Concrete aggregates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073971953

However, the microbial mechanisms responsible for the high efficiency and ability of DWTS to recycle wastewater are still unclear. In this study, the microbial community structure and function of two different anaerobic bioreactors (a primary sludge digestor, PSD, and anaerobic membrane bioreactor, AnMBR) of a DWTS located in Germany was investigated using 16S rRNA gene amplicon and metagenomic sequencing, respectively. The results showed that the microbial community structure was remarkably different in PSD and AnMBR. Methanobacteriaceae and Syntrophaceae were identified as the families that significantly differed in abundance between these two bioreactors. We also used genome-centered metagenomics to predict the microbial interactions and methane-generating pathway, which yielded 21 near-complete assembled genomes (MAGs) (average completeness of 93.0% and contamination of 2.9%). These MAGs together represented the majority of the microbial community. MAGsaffiliated with methanogenic archaea, including Methanobacterium sp., Methanomicrobiales archaea, Methanomassiliicoccales archaea, and Methanosaeta concilii, were recruited, along with other syntrophic bacterial MAGs associated with anaerobic digestion. Key genes encoding enzymes involved in specific carbohydrate-active and methanogenic pathways in MAGs were identified to illustrate the microbial functions and interactions that occur during anaerobic digestion in the wastewater treatment. From the MAG information, it was predicted that bacteria affiliated with Bacteroidetes, Prolixibacteraceae, and Synergistaceae were the key bacteria involved in anaerobic digestion. In the methane production step, Methanobacterium sp. performed hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, which reduced carbon dioxide to methane with hydrogen as the primary electron donor. Taken together, our findings provide a clear understanding of the methane-generating pathways and highlight the syntrophic interactions that occur during anaerobic digestion in DWTS. © 2019.","Anaerobic membrane bioreactor; Decentralized wastewater treatment system; Genome-centered metagenome; Methane generation; Primary sludge digester",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079166916

Two integration concepts are proposed with different sizing methods of the electrolyzer: (1) the case of full conversion of carbon in biomass, in which a large electrolyzer is driven by the electricity purchased from the grid, and (2) the case of zero power exchange, in which only part of the carbon in biomass is converted reaching self-sufficiency of electricity. The three cases including the state-of-the-art biomass-to-methanol process are investigated to identify (1) possible trade-offs between efficiency and costs, and (2) under which conditions, these concepts become economically viable. With a reference methanol production of 100 kton/year, the results show that there is an optimal design for the state-of-the-art case, which offers an efficiency of 53.3% due to steam cycles and a payback time of 4.8 years. For the integrated concepts, there are sharp trade-offs between the system efficiency and methanol production cost rate. The case of full carbon conversion can reach an energy efficiency of 64.5–66.0% but results in a longer payback time of over 11 years. The case of zero-power exchange can achieve a similar efficiency as the state-of-the-art case with a slightly increased payback time of over 5.5 years. The payback time of the full carbon conversion case can be shorter than 5 years with a reduction in stack cost and electricity price, and an increase in stack lifetime. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass-to-methanol; Entrained flow gasifier; Power-to-gas; Power-to-hydrogen; Solid-oxide electrolysis","Biomass; Carbon; Commerce; Economic and social effects; Electrolysis; Electrolytic cells; Energy efficiency; Hydrogen production; Methanol; Steam engineering; Air separation unit; Carbon conversions; Economically viable; Electricity prices; Entrained flow gasifiers; Methanol production; Solid oxide; Solid oxide electrolyzer; Costs; belowground biomass; biomass; efficiency measurement; electricity; electrokinesis; energy efficiency; equipment; methanol; optimization; self sufficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074688525

A 24-month field study was performed in subtropical China to monitor SR in experimental plots of local bamboo (Phyllostachys glauca) without fertilization (PG) and commercial bamboo (Phyllostachys praecox) with and without fertilization (PPF and PP, respectively). The SR rate and soil properties were measured on a monthly timescale. Results showed that the SR rate ranged from 0.38 to 8.53 mol CO2 m2s1, peaking in June. The PPF treatment had higher SR rates than the PP and PG treatments for most months; however, there were no significant differences among the treatments. The soil temperature (ST) in the surface layer (0-10 cm) was found to be the predominant factor controlling the temporal change pattern of the monthly SR rate in the PG and PP treatments (i.e., those without fertilization). A bivariate model is used to show that a natural factor-comprised of ST and soil water content (SWC)-explained 44.2% of the variation in the monthly SR rate, whereas biological (i.e., bamboo type) and management (i.e., fertilization) factors had a much smaller impact (less than 0.1% of the variation). The annual mean SR showed a significant positive correlation with soil organic matter (SOM; r = 0.51, P < 0.05), total nitrogen (TN; r = 0.47, P < 0.05), total phosphorus (TP; r = 0.60, P < 0.01), clay content (0.72, P < 0.05) and below-ground biomass (r = 0.60*), which altogether explain 69.0% of the variation in the annual SR. Our results indicate that the fertilization effect was not significant in SR rate for most months among the treatments, but was significant in the annual rate.

The data of 2012 is selected as the base period data. The haze control policy of Hebei Province is written into the model as an exogenous variable. Reducing the total PM2.5 emissions is an environmental constraint, which is used to eliminate the impact of natural factors on environmental quality. Lingo software is used to simulate this model. By comparing the socio-economic impacts in different scenarios, this book found the most effective policy combination of haze governance. Comprehensive haze governance policy recommendations provide experience for other regions of China and other developing countries. In this book, the dynamic simulation model of haze governance also provides a reference to other environmental policy simulations. This book is divided into five parts. The first part is an introduction. This paper mainly introduces the research background, research status at home and abroad, the purpose and significance of the study, the content and methods of the study, the key scientific problems to be solved and the expected results. In the second part, the current situation and existing problems of economic, social, energy and environment development in the study area are analyzed in detail. In the third part, a comprehensive evaluation model of dynamic optimization of haze control policy is constructed. The fourth part carries on the simulation experiment, and carries on the analysis to the experimental result. The fifth part puts forward the policy suggestions to realize the economic, social, energy and environmental development of Hebei Province. In this book, we have some understandings about haze governance. From the perspective of policy effect, the policy effects of subsidy for soil and water conservation, subsidy for development and utilization of clean energy, subsidy for new energy vehicles, motor vehicle restriction and subsidy for introduction of PM2.5 treatment technology are decreasing.

We then applied this methodology to investigate the role of cations in affecting the local pH during CO2RR and find that during CO2RR to CO on Au in an MHCO3 buffer (where M is an alkali metal), the experimentally measured local basicity decreased in the order Li+ &gt; Na+ &gt; K+ &gt; Cs+, which agreed with an earlier theoretical prediction by Singh et al. Our results also reveal that the formation of CO is independent of the cation. In summary, RRDE is a versatile tool for detecting local pH change over a diverse range of CO2RR catalysts. Additionally, using the product itself (i.e. CO) as the local pH probe allows us to investigate CO2RR without the interference of additional probe molecules introduced to the system. Most importantly, considering that most CO2RR products have pH-dependent oxidation, RRDE can be a powerful tool for determining the local pH and correlating the local pH to reaction selectivity. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

The data is sourced from the medical health database of a city in Southwest China, which involves approximately 14 million residents. A generalized additive model using a Poisson distribution was utilized to identify the effects of air pollution on the cost of hospitalization due to asthma. Hospital admissions were stratified by sex, age, season, and type of medical insurance to specialize the results. Air pollution significantly affects hospitalization expenses for asthma. These effects were more significant in the male, non-senior subgroups than in the female, senior subgroups. The difference also significantly existed in different insurance type subgroups. Air pollution has adverse effects on hospitalization expenses for asthma. Climate change is now deeply affecting the world in the aspects of economy and health.

We consider a shortest path problem with the objective function of minimizing a linear combination of the mean and standard deviation of carbon emissions. By adjusting the proportion of the standard deviation in the objective function, the effects of speed stochasticity and correlation are studied under different preferences of the decision-makers on the fluctuations of carbon emissions. Based on 102-day real speed data from the Los Angeles freeway network, this research conducts extensive numerical experiments on 200 randomly chosen origin-destination pairs. Experimental results demonstrate the necessity of considering speed stochasticity and correlation, especially when the standard deviation of carbon emissions takes a large proportion in the objective function. As the weight of the standard deviation in the objective function increases from 0 to 1.5, the reduction of emission objective values increases from 0.03% to 0.13% by considering speed stochasticity, and increases from 0.02% to 0.20% by considering speed correlation. Taking the city Los Angeles with about 2361 taxis and about 525,945 passenger orders in January 2017 as an example, 0.03% and 0.02% reductions respond to about 3156 kg and 2630 kg carbon emission, respectively. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emission objectives; Correlated stochastic speeds; Shortest path problem; Sustainability","carbon emission; decision making; stochasticity; sustainability; Los Angeles [California]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079538721

In order to satisfy the demand of real-time production control, a deep learning methodology for energy-efficient control of CNC machine tools is proposed in RFID-enabled ubiquitous environment. First, the energy-efficient control strategies for multiple machine tools are proposed to reduce the carbon emission of the machining process. Then, through evaluating the process progress in the RFID-enabled environment, a deep learning methodology for energy-efficient strategies selection of CNC machine tools using deep belief networks (DBNs) is established to realize the real-time and accurate control of machine tools. Finally, comparisons between the proposed approach and some state-of-the-art ones are given, and the experiment results indicate that the proposed method is effective and efficient for the energy-efficient control problem of machine tools. The proposed method can realize the real-time control of CNC machine tools based on the interaction information in Industrial 4.0. Furthermore, the machine tools will be converted to smart machines, which can complete self-perception and self-adjustment automatically. Note to Practitioners - It is significant but challenging work to realize the control of manufacturing processes based on real-time production data. Thus, this paper integrates RFID data of jobs with energy-efficient control of CNC machine tools, and proposes a deep learning methodology of processing the real-time production data in an RFID-enabled ubiquitous environment. Considering the relationship between different jobs, five energy-efficient control strategies for multiple machine tools are put forward to reduce the carbon emission of the machining processes. Then, an RFID-driven process progress evaluation is carried out to quantify the real-time progress, and two RFID data preprocessing algorithms are developed to cleanse and extract the original data. DBNs are adopted to realize the energy-efficient strategies selection of CNC machine tools. The experiments from an actual printing machine manufacturing enterprise indicate that the proposed method is effective and efficient for the energy-efficient control problem of machine tools. The implementation requires RFID-enabled manufacturing environment deployment, RFID data capturing and prepressing, and deep learning model establishment based on historical production data. Beyond the energy conservation of machine tools, the proposed method can also be applied to other industrial problems, e.g., self-perception and self-adjustment of smart machine tools, production rescheduling decisions, and logistics routing optimization. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","CNC machine tools; deep belief networks (DBNs); energy-efficient control strategies; RFID","Computer control systems; Deep learning; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Interactive computer systems; Machine tools; Machining; Manufacture; Production control; Radio frequency identification (RFID); Real time control; Real time systems; CNC machine tools; Deep belief networks; Energy efficient; Energy efficient strategies; Interaction information; Machining Process; Real-time production; Ubiquitous environments; Process control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071259764

We show that a common practice of conducting deterioration analysis for multiple-model-year groups may produce unrealistic deterioration rates, because the samples' model year constitution usually varies with age. As a more reliable approach, we analyze the deterioration for individual model years. We apply this approach to light-duty gasoline vehicle exhaust emission measurements conducted using remote sensing devices at a West Los Angeles location during seven campaigns between 1999 and 2015. Vehicles of 1985–1993 model years (termed herein as “pre-LEV” model years for predating California's Low-Emission Vehicle regulations), most of them older than 10 years when sampled, did not exhibit strong and consistent deterioration with age for carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) emissions, whereas their nitric oxide (NO) emissions appeared to deteriorate approximately linearly with age. The 1994–2003 model-year vehicles, subject to California's original Low-Emission Vehicle standards (LEV I standards) and up to about 20 years old when sampled, deteriorated approximately linearly with age for the three species. Our limited measurement records for the 2004–2014 model-year vehicles, subject to California's second-generation Low-Emission Vehicle standards (LEV II standards) and up to about 10 years old when sampled, did not exhibit consistent deterioration with age. Here we propose an empirical model to describe those deterioration patterns for the pre-LEV and LEV I vehicles. © 2019","Deterioration; Exhaust emission control; Light-duty vehicle; Measurement; Modeling; Remote sensing","Air pollution; Carbon monoxide; Emission control; Fleet operations; Gasoline; Measurement; Models; Nitric oxide; Remote sensing; Vehicles; Deterioration rates; Emission inventories; Exhaust emission control; Individual modeling; Light duty gasoline vehicles; Light duty vehicles; Low emission vehicles; Vehicle exhaust emissions; Deterioration; carbon monoxide; gasoline; hydrocarbon; nitric oxide; emission control; environmental degradation; environmental modeling; exhaust emission; measurement method; remote sensing; standard (regulation); traffic emission; air pollution control; Article; atmospheric pressure; California; car; exhaust gas; pollution monitoring; priority journal; remote sensing; traffic pollution; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074665213

This paper develops an alternative decomposition technique that uses data envelopment analysis (DEA) and distance functions to examine the sources of change in tourism CO2 emissions; this method offers advantages in measuring the contribution of factor inputs to CO2 emissions change and has flexible data requirements. An empirical application using provincial panel data from China's tourism industry during the 2005–2016 period is performed. The results indicate the following: The scale effect induced by economic growth in tourism was the largest factor driving CO2 emissions growth; technical change played a dominant role in reducing CO2 emissions, and technical efficiency change exerted a negligible positive effect on the CO2 emissions increment; the emissions indices associated with labour, capital, and attractive resources generated significant promoting effects on CO2 emissions growth; and the emissions index associated with energy had a minor inhibitory effect. In addition, the drivers of tourism CO2 emissions clearly varied by region and province, and three driving modes of change in provincial CO2 emissions were summarized.

However, to date, passive remote sensing measurements have provided limited information about aerosol extinction profiles. In this study, we propose the use of a spectral sorting approach to constrain the aerosol vertical structure using spectra of reflected sunlight absorption within the molecular oxygen (O2) A-band collected by the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2). The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated using spectra acquired over the western Sahara coast by comparing the aerosol profile retrievals with lidar measurements from the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP). Using a radiative transfer model to simulate OCO-2 measurements, we found that high-resolution O2 A-band measurements have high sensitivity to aerosol optical depth (AOD) and aerosol layer height (ALH). Retrieved estimates of AOD and ALH based on a look up table technique show good agreement with CALIPSO measurements, with correlation coefficients of 0.65 and 0.53, respectively. The strength of the proposed spectral sorting technique lies in its ability to identify spectral channels with high sensitivity to AOD and ALH and extract the associated information from the observed radiance in a straightforward manner. The proposed approach has the potential to enable future passive remote sensing missions to map the aerosol vertical distribution on a global scale. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Aerosol profiling; CALIPSO; Dust; O2 A-band; OCO-2","Atmospheric aerosols; Budget control; Dust; Greenhouse gases; Molecular oxygen; Optical radar; Orbits; Radiative transfer; Remote sensing; Space optics; Table lookup; Aerosol vertical structure; CALIPSO; Cloud-aerosol lidar and infrared pathfinder satellite observations; Cloud-aerosol lidar with orthogonal polarizations; Correlation coefficient; O2 A-band; OCO-2; Radiative transfer model; Air pollution; absorption; aerosol; Allan Hills meteorite; atmospheric pollution; CALIPSO; dust; lidar; measurement method; OCO; optical depth; radiative transfer; remote sensing; vertical distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074340646

We employ an energy-efficient microwave-assisted route to synthesize copper/copper oxides with different structures and morphologies. The initial oxidation state of the copper on the surface significantly influences the performance of the materials in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). On the as-prepared material surface, a high content of Cu2O improves the selectivity toward CO and consequently the catalyzed CO2RR produce a syngas with a low H2/CO ratio, while the CuO performs poorly. In particular, Cu2O particles with a cubic shape show the highest selectivity for the CO formation. The superior catalytic activity of the Cu2O cubes for the CO2RR is attributed to the surface roughening under potential, which offers abundant electrochemically active sites and facilitates mass transport. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

All sorts of otherwise unproblematic activities become morally questionable due to their contribution to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. All sorts of pre-existing vulnerabilities increase the danger that changes in climatic patterns result in humanitarian catastrophes. Climate change thus poses challenges for normative theory: There are ethical questions such as how to balance the right to development and poverty reduction with our duties to reduce greenhouse gases for the sake of future generations? There are also conceptual questions, for example, how are we to understand normatively significant responsibility in the context of complex collective action problems? There are questions relating to ethical guidelines in circumstances of risk and uncertainty. Finally, there is the question of to how to motivate people to do the right thing where there is so much distance in time and space between those incurring the costs of combatting climate change and those most benefitting from preventing it. Additionally, there also are particular challenges which require us to reassess our approaches to ethics in international relations: How are we to deal with the situation that those who hold the most power and have the greatest capacities for realising an effective global climate policy have the least incentives to do so? How are we to assess the relevant normative concerns when they involve issues more complex than those enshrined in the minimal ethical consensus of formal human rights?

These strategies include opening windows, turning on air conditioners, using fans, and their combinations while considering the effect of occupancy. The overall thermal sensation, draught risk, and CO2 concentration were experimentally studied during the holy month of Ramadan. In the naturally ventilated mosque, opening windows considerably improved the air quality but increased the indoor relative humidity. Using fans has the potential to enhance the air quality by reducing pollution in the occupied zone, and to improve the overall thermal sensation. The drawback of using fans was the risk of discomfort due to the peaks in air speed caused by rotation of the fans, which must be prevented to attain comfortable conditions. Turning the air conditioning on during prayers was not an efficient strategy to improve thermal comfort.

Air pollution with high PM levels has been frequently reported in China, however, no Chinese study has determined the association between PM exposures and anxiety hospitalizations. We examined the potential association between PM concentrations and anxiety admissions in 26 Chinese cities from January 2014 to December 2015. Methods: A time-stratified case-crossover design was employed in the study. Anxiety hospitalizations were identified according to ICD-10 from the electronic hospitalization summary reports system in China. Conditional logistic regression was applied to estimate the relation between PM levels and anxiety admissions, stratified by age and sex. Results: Positive associations between PM2.5/PM10 and admitted anxiety cases were observed. PM2.5 had the largest effect estimate at lag 5 days, with a per 10 μg/m3 increase corresponding to a 0.63% (95% CI, 0.26–1.00) increase in anxiety admissions. PM10's largest effect estimate was observed at lag 3 days, increasing 0.37% (95% CI, 0.12–0.62) anxiety admissions per 10 μg/m3. Females were more sensitive to PM2.5/PM10 concentrations than males, however, the effect modification by age was not significant. A marginally significant distinction in anxiety hospitalizations was found in patients with and without CVDs when they were exposed to PM2.5. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that short-term exposure to increased concentrations of PM2.5/PM10 exacerbates risks of anxiety hospitalizations in 26 Chinese cities. We observed effect modification by sex, with significantly stronger associations in female patients. This study offers the promise that reducing PM air pollution could probably reduce the huge disease burden from anxiety disorders. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Anxiety; China; Hospitalization; Particulate matter","air pollutant; air pollution; anxiety disorder; cardiovascular disease; China; environmental exposure; hospitalization; human; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Anxiety Disorders; Cardiovascular Diseases; China; Environmental Exposure; Hospitalization; Humans; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072288338

Heat reserved within the engine bay is beneficial to the engine cold-start for potentially reductions in friction losses, CO2 emissions and fuel consumption. Buoyancy-driven convection, thermal radiation and conduction are key contributors to heat transfer processes of engine compartments during soak. In this study, a coupled transient 3D computational fluids dynamics (CFD) – heat transfer modelling method was studied in a passenger vehicle to simulate its 9 h cool-down behaviours. The developed CAE method was able to predict the temperature cool-down of the key fluids of good agreement with experiments. Potential air and heat leakage paths around the engine bay were identified. The flow development during the early stage (0–2 h) of the soak was vital to accurate prediction of the heat transfer coefficients for the heat retention modelling, where convection and radiation have played important parts. Optimum simulation strategy was obtained with reduced simulation time and good prediction accuracy. This further allows the integration of engine encapsulation design for optimising fuel consumption and emissions in a timely and robust manner, aiding the development of low-carbon transport technologies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","ATCT/WLTC driving cycle; Buoyancy-driven heat transfer; CAE method; Heat retention modelling; Vehicle thermal soak","Buoyancy; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer aided engineering; Engines; Forecasting; Heat radiation; Heat transfer coefficients; Starting; Vehicles; Buoyancy-driven; Buoyancy-driven convection; Computational fluids dynamics; Driving cycle; Heat retention; Numerical investigations; Thermal soak; Transient heat transfer process; Heat convection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073551284

By comparing four Chinese municipal governments’ incentives and governing practices in promoting solar water heater adoption, this paper finds that Chinese local governments’ environmental incentive is still not compelling or stable enough, while governments that are motivated by economic interests would resort to more substantial governance practices to promote the low-carbon innovations. These results indicate potential in latecomer cities in developing both economic and environmental incentives towards low-carbon innovations because green activities could also be favored if they are well aligned with local economic development. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Governing modes; Incentive matrix; Local government; Urban transition","comparative study; economic development; governance approach; incentive; local government; solar power; sustainability; urban development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074778427

Given this shortcoming, more reliable information regarding its SOC is needed. In light of this, we quantified above and below-ground carbon sinks using both the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford approach (CASA) model and an improved carbon cycle process model. We also assessed the net present value (NPV) for carbon budgets under different carbon price and discount rate scenarios using the NPV model. Our results indicated that the net primary productivity (NPP) was lower in places with low density forests that were situated at high elevation. The spatial distribution of carbon storage depended on NPP production and litter decompositon, which reflected specific vegetation as well as temperature and moisture gradients. The lowest amounts of carbon storage were in the center of the Qinling Mountains and also partly in the Daba area, which is a location associated with sparse grassland. Contrastingly, the broad-leaved forested area showed the highest amount of carbon storage. NPV was positively correlated with discount rate and carbon prices, thus resulting in the highest values in the forests and grassland. The net present value of total soil carbon sequestration in the six scenarios in 2015 was 3.555 b yuan, 3.621 b yuan, 5.421 b yuan, 5.579 b yuan, 7.530 b yuan, 7.929 b yuan; The net present value of total soil carbon sequestration in 6 scenarios in 2017 is 2.816 b yuan, 2.845 b yuan, 4.361 b yuan, 4.468 b yuan, 6.144 b yuan, 6.338 b yuan (billion = 109; b; RMB is the legal currency of the China, and its unit is yuan, 1 euro = 7.7949 yuan, and 1 pound = 9.2590 yuan). Levying a carbon tax would be a notable option for decision makers as they develop carbon emission reduction policies. Given this, incorporating discount rates and carbon pricing would allow for more realistic value estimations of soil organic carbon. This approach would also provide a theoretical basis and underscore the practical significance for the government to set a reasonable carbon price. © 2019 by the authors.

This study aimed to investigate associations between traffic-related nitrogen oxides (NOx) or noise pollution and risk of incident metabolic syndrome and its components in an elderly Mexican-American population. Methods: A total of 1,554 Mexican-American participants of the Sacramento Area Latino Study on Aging (SALSA) cohort were followed from 1998 to 2007. We used anthropometric measures and biomarkers to define metabolic syndrome according to the recommendations of the Third Adult Treatment Panel of the National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP ATP III). Based on participants’ residential addresses at baseline, estimates of local traffic-related NOx were generated using the California Line Source Dispersion Model version 4 (CALINE4), and of noise employing the SoundPLAN software package. We used Cox regression models with calendar time as the underlying time scale to calculate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of air pollution or noise with metabolic syndrome or its components. Results: Each per unit increase of traffic-related NOx (2.29 parts per billion (ppb)) was associated with a 15% (HR = 1.15, 95% CI: 1.04–1.28) lower level of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-cholesterol), and each 11.6 decibels (dB) increase in noise increased the risk of developing metabolic syndrome by 17% (HR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.01–1.35). Conclusion: Policies aiming to reduce traffic-related air pollution and noise might mitigate the risk of metabolic syndrome and its components in vulnerable populations. © 2019 The Authors","Air pollution, noise; Metabolic syndrome; Mexican-Americans","Air pollution; Cholesterol; Nitrogen oxides; Noise pollution; Regression analysis; Confidence interval; Dispersion modeling; Education programs; High-density lipoprotein cholesterols; Metabolic syndromes; Mexican-Americans; Potential impacts; Traffic-related air pollution; Metabolism; atmospheric pollution; cohort analysis; elderly population; health risk; Latino people; metabolism; nitrogen oxides; noise pollution; pollution effect; pollution exposure; traffic emission; aged; air pollution; Article; California; cohort analysis; disease association; exposure; female; human; major clinical study; male; metabolic syndrome X; Mexican American; noise pollution; priority journal; air pollutant; environmental exposure; exhaust gas; metabolic syndrome X; middle aged; noise; particulate matter; California; Sacramento; United States; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Male; Metabolic Syndrome; Mexican Americans; Middle Aged; Noise; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075421167

These parks are not only crucial for the country to accelerate industrialization but also to achieve its climate change targets. Constructing CO2 emission inventories for industrial parks is the first step in analysing the park's emission patterns and designing low-carbon policies. However, most of the previous emission accounts for industrial parks adopted various scopes and methodologies, making them incomparable with each other. This study develops a self-consistent methodology and framework for China's industrial parks based on enterprise-level data. We consider both Scope 1 and 2 emissions and construct the inventories by 19 energy types and 39 industrial sectors, which are consistent with the existing national, provincial, and city-level emission inventories. Such sectoral-based emission inventories will be not only able to provide data support for the design of emission/energy control policies, but also help the central/local governments evaluate a park's emission reduction performance. Finally, an empirical study is applied to four industrial parks to verify the method. In addition, we review the eco-industrial park programmes in Japan and South Korea, as well as their emissions accounting framework. We find that most of the Japanese industrial parks provide Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, while for South Korea, parks mostly focus on Scope 1 emissions. The discussion of Japan and South Korea's eco-industrial parks have referential significance for the construction China's low-carbon parks. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Climate change; CO2 emissions; Industrial parks","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; China; CO2 emissions; Eco-industrial park; Emission inventories; Emission reduction; Industrial parks; Industrial sector; Low-carbon policies; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072928349

This study aims to provide a city-level estimation of the PM2.5-related disease burden of two major CVDs, ischemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke, by age and sex in Hubei province, China in 2016. PM2.5 mass concentrations (μg/m3) at different cities were obtained from the Hubei Provincial Environmental Quality Supervision and Administration Bureau. The city-level demographic data in Hubei were obtained from the sixth demographic census of China in 2010. Sex- and age-specific mortality and DALY data were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease Study (GBD) 2016. The integrated exposure-response (IER) model, developed by the GBD, was used to estimate PM2.5-related CVD premature deaths and DALYs in Hubei province. We found that 55.76 thousand deaths and 1.11 million DALYs of IHD and stroke could be attributed to exposure to ambient PM2.5 in Hubei. Disease burden of IHD and stroke attributable to PM2.5 increased with age and were higher in males than in females. The PM2.5-related disease burden of IHD and stroke was mainly concentrated in the eastern part of Hubei. The highest population attributable fraction (PAF) of IHD and stroke was mainly concentrated in the western part of Hubei.

This study offers both satellite and model perspectives on the interannual variability and possible trends of combustion aerosol and dust in major continental outflow regions over the past 15 years (2003-2017). The decade-long record of aerosol optical depth (AOD, denoted as τ), separately for combustion aerosol (τc) and dust (τd), over global oceans is derived from the Collection 6 aerosol products of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) onboard both Terra and Aqua. These MODIS Aqua datasets, complemented by aerosol source-tagged simulations using the Community Atmospheric Model version 5 (CAM5), are then analyzed to understand the interannual variability and potential trends of τc and τd in the major continental outflows. Both MODIS and CAM5 consistently yield a similar decreasing trend of -0.017 to -0.020 per decade for τc over the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea that is attributable to reduced emissions from North America and Europe, respectively. On the contrary, both MODIS and CAM5 display an increasing trend of C0.017 to C0.036 per decade for τc over the tropical Indian Ocean, the Bay of Bengal, and the Arabian Sea, which reflects the influence of increased anthropogenic emissions from South Asia and the Middle East in the last 2 decades. Over the northwestern Pacific Ocean, which is often affected by East Asian emissions of pollution and dust, the MODIS retrievals show a decreasing trend of -0.021 per decade for τc and -0.012 per decade for τd, which is, however, not reproduced by the CAM5 model. In other outflow regions strongly influenced by biomass burning smoke or dust, both MODIS retrievals and CAM5 simulations show no statistically significant trends; the MODIS-observed interannual variability is usually larger than that of the CAM5 simulation. © Author(s) 2020.",,"aerosol; annual variation; biomass burning; combustion; computer simulation; dust; emission inventory; fuel consumption; long range transport; MODIS; numerical model; optical depth; pollutant transport; Arabian Sea; Bay of Bengal; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (Tropical); Middle East; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Northwest); South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077601006

A steady-state model for the N2(A) vibrational distribution in the terrestrial thermosphere is here described and validated by comparison with N2 A-X, Vegard-Kaplan dayglow spectra from the Ionospheric Spectroscopy and Atmospheric Chemistry spectrograph. A computationally cheaper method is needed for implementation of the N2(A) chemistry into time-dependent thermospheric models. It is shown that by scaling the photoelectron impact production of ionized N2 by a Gaussian centered near 100 km, the level-specific N2(A) production rates between 100 and 200 km can be reproduced to within an average of 5%. This scaling, and thus the N2 electron impact ionization/excitation ratio, is nearly independent of existing uncertainties in the 2–20 nm solar soft X-ray irradiance. To investigate this independence, the N2 electron-impact excitation cross sections in the GLOW photoelectron model are replaced with the results of Johnson et al. (2005, https://doi.org/10.1029/2005JA011295) and the multipart work of Malone et al.

Alternative bedding materials cultivated directly on livestock farms could potentially avoid this transport and competition for use. For the first time, we applied consequential life cycle assessment (LCA) to account for the direct and indirect implications of miscanthus bedding production on livestock farms, considering displacement of fodder or livestock, and substitution of fossil fuels with straw in electricity generation. We modelled the effect of substituting straw with ‘home-grown’ miscanthus bedding across seven beef and sheep farms. The consequences of displacing grass forage (or animal) production with home-grown miscanthus bedding cultivation were evaluated via three farmer decision scenarios: buy extra concentrate feed (D1), utilize remaining pasture areas more efficiently (D2) and buy grass silage (D3). Electricity generated from displaced straw (bedding) substituted either natural gas or coal electricity. Sensitivity analyses were undertaken using 34 scenario permutations to represent combinations of feed and electricity substitution, miscanthus fertilization rates and yields, and the quality of displaced pasture. Consequential LCA indicates that miscanthus bedding production could be environmentally beneficial, under scenarios involving D2 and D3. However, greenhouse gas emissions and wider environmental burdens may be increased under D1 scenarios, owing to the environmental cost of additional concentrate feed production, and possible indirect land use change, outweighing the benefits from: (a) fossil electricity substitution with straw bioelectricity; (b) reduced animal emissions via improved digestibility of concentrate feed; (c) avoided straw transport. The ratio of the yield of miscanthus to replaced grass was found to be a critical determinant of D1 environmental outcomes. We conclude that if grass forage production can be better managed, the use of miscanthus as a bedding material on livestock farms provides environmental benefits via diversion of straw to bioenergy use. © 2019 The Authors.

It should be noted that land degradation has a serious socio-economic impact on the standard of living and health of the population, especially on socially vulnerable sections of the rural population. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

While perennials or cover-cropped grains often have greater root production than annual grain crops, they variably impact soil carbon and underlying mechanisms remain unclear. We used high-frequency measurements of soil respiration and natural abundance carbon stable isotopes to differentiate respiration sources, pool sizes, and decomposition rate constants during a 10 month incubation of soils collected to 1 m depth from a 10 year old field experiment in Iowa, United States. Conversion of corn–soybean rotations to reconstructed prairies or addition of a rye cover crop to continuous corn significantly altered respiration sources and dynamics of fast- and slow-cycling carbon (turnover times of weeks to months–years, respectively), but had little effect on bulk soil carbon and several extractable pools (except in fertilized prairie). Both unfertilized and fertilized prairies increased slow-cycling carbon pools relative to annual crops, but only in 0–25 cm soil. Compared with fertilized prairie, the unfertilized prairie significantly increased decomposition rates of fast- and slow-cycling carbon pools in 0–25 cm soil, likely explaining the lack of significant bulk soil carbon accrual despite twofold greater root production. Carbon derived from C4 plants decomposed faster than C3-derived carbon across all depths and cropping systems and contributions of C3-carbon to respiration increased with depth. Respiration of cover crop-derived carbon was greatest in 0–25 cm soil but comprised &gt;25% of respiration below 25 cm, implying a disproportionate impact of the cover crop on deep soil metabolism. However, the cover crop also increased the decomposition rates of fast- and slow-cycling carbon pools and decreased their pool sizes across all depths relative to corn without a cover crop. Despite their notable environmental benefits, neither unfertilized perennials nor cover crops necessarily promote rapid soil carbon sequestration relative to conventional annual bioenergy systems because of concomitant increases in decomposition. © 2019 The Authors.

In a context where the notion of civil society in these countries remains unclear, the inclusion principle is difficult to enact, particularly with regard to women who are still largely underrepresented in this type of process. Moreover, there is a risk that participatory initiatives widen the gap between “politically engaged” citizens and their more apathetic counterparts. Power relationships between participants are another important issue. If not properly tackled, they can lead to the maintenance of traditional hegemonic discourses - rather than to innovative ways of thinking. Lastly, the concrete implementation of the solutions or compromises emerging from participatory processes is paramount for their legitimacy. This chapter examines and compares two cases of participatory processes put forward in the context of a public health project aiming at reducing air pollution in the cities of Cotonou (Benin) and Dakar (Senegal). This allows us to reflect on the issues, challenges, and conditions of success of the participatory processes orchestrated in these contexts. It also brings support to the need to address various challenges when participatory initiatives are fostered and shows that these challenges are met differently in the two countries. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Air pollution; Benin; Communication; Dialogue; Inclusiveness; Power relationships; Public health; Public participation; Senegal",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089630058

To utilize local biomass reserves more efficiently in the context of future energy demand, the possession of knowledge about recent energy system in different sectors of the country has become interestingly important. A few initiatives and technologies are currently under process in order to move towards renewable resources from non-renewable resources and minimizing dependency on fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In recent past, some ideas have been developed for sustainable biofuel production which will make sure a rapid shift from an unsustainable attitude towards a potentially sustainable approach. Hence, in this review, detailed data about the potential of biomass for the production of renewable energy in Pakistan have been presented, keeping in view the recent energy mix and future perspectives. The feasibility of local/indigenous biomass reserves and important conversion methods to transform such biomass reserves to bioenergy has also been discussed. Here, we also highlighted the drivers for consumption of local/indigenous biomass reserves in future energy system along with the challenges related to energy systems among various stakeholders. Finally, the suggestions/recommendations on the government policies and future directions for successful implementation of the energy production from local/indigenous biomass resources have been given which could be sufficient to meet increasing energy demands of Pakistan. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Bioenergy; Biomass; Energy resources; Residues","alternative energy; bioenergy; biomass power; energy planning; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; plant residue; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077898935

This paper aims to analyze the impact of fiscal decentralization on carbon emissions by spatial Durbin model (SDM), and verify the existence of “free-riding” phenomenon to reveal the behavior of local governments in carbon emissions control. Design/methodology/approach: Based on the provincial data of carbon emissions from 2005 to 2016 in China, this paper uses spatial exploratory data analysis technology to analyze the spatial correlation characteristics and constructs SDM to test the impact of fiscal decentralization on carbon emissions. Findings: The results show that carbon emissions exhibits significant spatial autocorrelation in China, and the increasing of fiscal decentralization in the region will increase carbon emissions in surrounding areas and on the whole. Then, by comparing the impact of fiscal decentralization on carbon emissions and industrial solid waste, it is found that “free-riding” phenomenon of carbon emissions control exists in China. Practical implications: Based on the spatial cluster characteristics of China’s provincial carbon emissions, carbon emissions control regions can be divided into regions and different carbon emission control policies can be formulated for different cluster regions. Carbon emissions indicators should be included in the government performance appraisal policy, and carbon emissions producer survey should be increased in environmental policies to avoid “free-riding” behaviors of local government in carbon emissions control in China. Originality/value: This paper contributes to fill this gap and fully considers the spatial spillover characteristics of carbon emissions by introducing spatial exploratory data analysis technology, constructs SDM to test the impact of fiscal decentralization on carbon emissions in the perspective of space econometrics, and tests the existence of “free-riding” phenomenon in carbon emissions control for local governments in China. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carbon emissions; Fiscal decentralization; Spatial Durbin model; “Free-riding” phenomenon","Data handling; Economics; Emission control; Environmental protection; Information analysis; Public policy; Spatial variables measurement; Statistics; Carbon emissions; Design/methodology/approach; Exploratory data analysis; Fiscal decentralization; Free riding; Industrial solid wastes; Spatial autocorrelations; Spatial Durbin models; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073993697

Examining the socioeconomic factors influencing on PM2.5 concentration is important for regional prevention and control. Previous studies mainly concentrated on the economically developed eastern coastal cities, but few studies focused on inland cities. This study selected Chengdu Plain Economic Zone (CPEZ), an inland region with heavy smog, and used spatial econometrics methods to identify the spatiotemporal distribution characteristics of PM2.5 concentration and the socioeconomic factors underlying it from 2006 to 2016. Moran’s index indicates that PM2.5 concentration in CPEZ does have spatial aggregation characteristics. In general, the spatial clustering from the fluctuation state to the stable low state decreased by 1% annually on average, from 0.190 (p &lt; 0.05) in 2006 to 0.083 (p &lt; 0.1) in 2016. According to the results of the spatial Durbin model (SDM), socioeconomic factors including population density, energy consumption per unit of output, gross domestic product (GDP), and per capita GDP have a positive effect on PM2.5 concentration, while greening rate and per capita park space have a negative effect. Additionally, those factors have identified spatial spillover effects on PM2.5 concentration. This study could be a reference and support for the formulation of more efficient air pollution control policies in inland cities. © 2019 by the authors.

Mechanical properties of neat CNF films or CNF-polymer matrix nanocomposites are usually much better than for polymer matrix composite films reinforced by clay, graphene, graphene oxide, or carbon nanotubes. In order to obtain small CNF diameter and colloidal stability, chemical modification has so far been necessary, but this increases cost and reduces eco-friendly attributes. In this study, an unmodified holocellulose CNF (Holo-CNF) with small diameter is obtained from mildly peracetic acid delignified wood fibers. CNF is readily defibrillated by low-energy kitchen blender processing. The hemicellulose coating on individual fibrils in the wood plant cell wall is largely preserved in Holo-CNF. This ""native"" CNF shows well-preserved native fibril structure in terms of length (∼2.1 μm), diameter (<5 nm), high crystallinity, high cellulose molar mass, electronegative charge, and limited mechanical processing damage. The hemicellulose coating contributes mechanical properties and high optical transmittance for CNF nanopaper, which can otherwise only be achieved with chemically modified CNFs. The CNF nanopaper shows superior mechanical properties with a Young's modulus of 21 GPa and an ultimate strength of 320 MPa. Moreover, hemicellulose imparts recyclability from the dried state. Altogether, this native CNF represents a class of colloidally stable, eco-friendly, low-cost CNF of small diameter for large-scale applications of nanopaper and nanomaterials.

The spatial and temporal distributions of soil organic carbon (SOC), water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and soil microbial biomass carbon (SMBC) under different water-carbon regulation scenarios were analyzed on the basis of field experiments in the Taihu Lake region in China to explore the effects of biochar application on SOC and its components in water-saving irrigation paddy fields. The response of soil catalase (CAT) and invertase (INV) to biochar application in water-saving irrigated rice fields was clarified. The results showed that water-saving irrigation reduced the SOC content by 5.7% to 13.3% but increased WSOC and SMBC contents by 13.8% to 26.1% and 0.9% to 11.1%, respectively, as compared with flooding irrigation. Nonflooding management promoted the oxidative decomposition of soil organic matter. Two years after straw biochar was added, paddy soil SOC content under water-saving irrigation was increased by 4.0% to 26.7%. The WSOC and SMBC contents were also increased by 4.0% to 52.4% and 7.0% to 40.8%, respectively. The high straw biochar addition rate exhibited great impact on SOC. Remarkable correlations among SOC, WSOC, and SMBC were observed, indicating that the addition of straw biochar improved soil labile C, such as WSOC and SMBC, which promoted SOC transformation and stability in paddy soil under water-saving irrigation. Soil CAT and INV were related to SOC conversion. In conclusion, the combination of water-saving irrigation and straw biochar addition was beneficial to the improvement of soil properties and fertility of paddy fields. © 2020 by the authors.

Mitigation of PFC release by reducing anode effects (AEs) occurring during aluminum reduction is challenging. In this study, online anode current measurements were conducted at the anode beam of 400-kA cells, following which a simple local AE detection model was developed for AE prediction. A satisfactory AE true positive prediction rate of 80.3% was obtained in an industrial test. An independently controlled feeder strategy was then developed and applied to cells integrated with the local AE detection and prevention. The results show that the process provides an improved current efficiency with low direct current power consumption.

Atomically precise Aun clusters (n=number of gold atoms) bridge the gap between non-metallic and metallic catalysts and offer new opportunities for unveiling the hidden properties of gold catalysts in the metallic, transition regime, and non-metallic states. Here, we report the controllable conversion of CO2 over three non-metallic Aun clusters, including Au9, Au11, and Au36, towards different target products: methane produced on Au9, ethanol on Au11, and formic acid on Au36.

The corresponding radiative forcing and climate responses were also explored. The PM2.5 burden decreases over most continents, especially East Asia. The CPM particles increase over northern Asia, North America, and central Africa, in contrast to decrease over most regions of East Asia and North Africa. Relative to 2014, the global annual mean effective radiative forcing due to changes in PM2.5 and CPM burden are 1.17 (1.10) and -0.06 (-0.07) W m-2 under RCP4.5 (RCP8.5), respectively. The reduction in PM2.5 burden leads to apparent warming, especially over high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, with global annual mean surface air temperature increasing by 1.25 K under RCP4.5, and 1.22 K under RCP8.5. In contrast, changes in CPM result in apparent cooling over North America and northern Asia, with global annual mean changes in surface air temperature of 0.10 K for both scenarios. The Northern Hemisphere Hadley cell weakens and moves northward due to changes in PM2.5 after 2014, whereas the corresponding circulation in the Southern Hemisphere is strengthened, with the Intertropical Convergence Zone shifting to 10°N. Global annual mean precipitation increases by 0.10 mm day-1 under both scenarios. Generally, anthropogenic PM2.5 contributes significantly to future changes in radiative forcing and climate. ©2019.

We developed a carbon quota allocation framework at the provincial level considering both the equity and efficiency principles based on a multi-objective non-linear programming model. We established a carbon Gini coefficient and an emission abatement cost function to measure the equity and efficiency of quota allocation, respectively. We then introduced them as objectives into a multi-objective non-linear programming model and obtained the optimal emission quota allocation for 30 provinces in China, by realizing the trade-off between the equity and efficiency principles. Our analysis revealed that Chinese carbon emissions have not yet peaked and that the proportion of carbon emission in each province is similar. Moreover, provinces with higher GDP per capita, carbon intensity, and historical accumulated carbon emissions should shoulder more burden of carbon intensity reduction and higher marginal reduction costs. The rationality analysis indicates that our method outperforms traditional methods according to the principles of both equity and efficiency. We conclude by offering policy recommendations for the establishment of a national unified carbon market. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","carbon Gini coefficient; Carbon quota allocation; efficiency principle; equity principle","Cost functions; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Nonlinear programming; Carbon emissions; Carbon intensity reductions; Efficiency principles; Emission abatement; Equity and efficiencies; equity principle; Gini coefficients; Policy recommendations; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076481361

Vegetation restoration in postmining areas plays an important role in rebuilding soil C pool and improving soil quality. In this study, soil C sequestration and soil properties of different vegetation types were investigated along restoration chronosequences in a postmining area in the eastern Loess Plateau. The results showed that soil properties improved substantially through artificial restoration by planting Rhus typhina (exotic species) and Platycladus orientalis (indigenous species) and through natural restoration. Soil C stock (0–20 cm depth) increased significantly with restoration duration in all of the vegetation types and was positively correlated to plant diversity except in R. typhina. After 12–20 years from restoration, accumulation rates of soil C varied significantly with vegetation type, with the maximum in P. orientalis (0.60 Mg ha−1 yr−1) and the minimum in naturally restored grassland (0.21 Mg ha−1 year−1). The optimum performance of P. orientalis plantation could be attributed mainly to high plant diversity and associated high fine root biomass (1.72 Mg ha−1). A sharp decrease of plant diversity (39.0%) in R. typhina 12 years after restoration implied that soil C accumulation might not be sustainable in the long term. Our results suggest that P. orientalis as an indigenous species adaptable to harsh environment may facilitate the succession of a diverse ecosystem and promote soil C accumulation in degraded lands of postmining areas. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","exotic species; land degradation; restoration type; soil C stock; vegetation succession","Carbon; Ecosystems; Forestry; Restoration; Vegetation; Accumulation rates; Exotic species; Land degradation; Natural restoration; Optimum performance; Platycladus orientalis; Vegetation restoration; Vegetation successions; Soils; carbon sequestration; coal mining; coniferous tree; deciduous tree; ecosystem function; land degradation; restoration ecology; soil carbon; soil property; species diversity; vegetation type; China; Loess Plateau; Shanxi; Platycladus orientalis; Rhus typhina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074833768

Thus the production of crops in an integrated agricultural system must be capable not only to integrate and to harmonize between commodity components, various species of crops and livestock, but also to integrate and harmonize these commodity components with various elements in every environmental factor, both biotic and abiotic. The integration and harmonizasion based on renewable natural resources is an effort to realize a sustainable plant production (for profit, for people and for planet). Two groups of environmental factors grow plants, namely Abiotics: Climate and Edafik (land), and Fire; And Biotics: Disruptive organisms (pests, diseases and weeds), beneficial organisms (land caverage vegetations, bacteria and non-pathogenic fungi, symbiotic). Climate and soil factors are the two main factors interacting with the changing environmental factors of crops as a result of climate change, whether global, local, or micro. These changes have been identified to be environmental stresses for plants. Abiotic stresses of temperature, water and nutrients provide a weakening condition, thereby increasing the vulnerability of plants to biotic stress. Various efforts need to be continued to develop integrated agricultural production technology that utilizes local natural resources to enable plants to adapt to environmental stress.

While several technical options have been proposed to reduce these emissions, gaps in data and information based on application of these options in the field are a key barrier to scaling-up. To address these gaps, we conducted a review of literature to analyze the potential of technical options in Southeast Asia (SEA). Using screening criteria based on reliability of experimental data, 31 region-specific cases were selected for the analysis. A meta-analysis indicated that water management options, including single and multiple drainage approaches such as alternative wetting and drying (AWD), significantly reduced CH4 emissions by 35% as a mean effect size (95% confidential interval: 41–29%), as well as the combined effects of CH4+N2O (net GWP) by 29% (36–23%). The effect on reducing CH4 emissions in the dry season was significantly larger than that in the wet season. Application of biochar reduced both CH4 and N2O emissions by 20% (40% to −7%), while significantly increased rice yield by 28% (8–52%). Other options such as removal of rice straw from the previous crop, composting rice straw and manure, application of sulfate-containing fertilizer, and soil drying in the fallow season also have recognized potential to reduce emissions but require further data and consideration of possible trade-offs. Based on the analysis of mitigation potential, promising technical options were assessed by considering together with constraints and additional co-benefits in order to provide a useful guide for policy makers and rice value chain operators in SEA countries for adopting mitigation options in rice cultivation to tackle climate change and enhance agriculture sector sustainability. © 2019, © 2019 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.","Climate change; meta-analysis; methane; nitrous oxide; water management",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074614562

China has access to abundant biomass resources, with considerable biogas potential and an annual theoretical output of 73.6 billion m3. Household-based biogas digesters coexist with medium and large-scale biogas plants (MLBPs) in China. Although the number of MLBPs in China was almost two times higher than Europe, the annul biogas production yield was only half of those in Europe. In China, biogas is mainly used for heating and cooking, and its power generation capacity is far lower than that in Europe. Overall, biogas industry is more commercialized in Europe than China. In terms of biogas related policies, China has an advantage in quantity, but is weak in their implementation. Biogas related policies in China mainly focus on agricultural and rural development, while in Europe, they are aimed at increasing the utilization of renewable energy and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, policies in China are mostly filled with encouragement, lacking detailed subsidy schemes and modes, whereas in European countries are more targeted and scientific. Based on the dissimilarity of current status and the disparity in policies, a series of countermeasures and suggestions for the development of the Chinese biogas industry are presented. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas commercialization; Biogas development; Biogas industry; Biogas plant; Biogas-related policy; Policy framework","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Regional planning; Biogas plants; Biomass resources; European Countries; Industry development; Policy framework; Power generation capacities; Renewable energies; Rural development; Biogas",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073533497

However, there are still uncertainties about the response of soil carbon stocks to enhanced soil salinization caused by accelerated sea-level rises and aggravated saltwater intrusion. We therefore conducted both field investigations in the Chongming Dongtan salt marsh of the Yangtze River Estuary, China, and manipulative experiments on marsh soils occupied, respectively, by the invasive Spartina alterniflora, and the native Phragmites australis and Scirpus mariqueter, to identify the effects of elevated soil salinity on top soil organic carbon (SOC) concentration. Our field data showed that SOC concentrations were significantly positively associated with soil salinity concentrations, annual net primary productivity, and marsh surface elevation but showed a significant negative relationship with median grain size. Compared with the two native species, S. alterniflora preferred more saline conditions and had a higher SOC concentration. Although raised flooding salinities (0–35 ppt) did not strongly affect SOC concentrations, elevated soil salinities significantly corresponded with low SOC concentrations and plant biomass in manipulative experiments. These findings indicated that soil salinity, plant species, and soil texture were key factors controlling SOC concentrations in the studied salt marsh. Moreover, soil salinity could affect SOC concentrations through regulating vegetation spatial structure and plant biomass production.

Here, we first synthesized Bi4NbO8Cl nanosheets with {001} exposing facets by a molten-salt growth method, which shows largely promoted photocatalytic performance for the degradation of tetracycline (TC) and bisphenol A (BPA) in comparison with Bi4NbO8Cl particles obtained by solid-state reaction. The 2D/2D Bi4NbO8Cl/g-C3N4 heterojunction photocatalysts were then fabricated via high-energy ball-milling and post-sintering to realize intimate interfacial interaction. The photocatalytic activity of all the Bi4NbO8Cl/g-C3N4 composites largely enhances compared to Bi4NbO8Cl nanosheets and g-C3N4, also far exceeding the mechanically-mixed Bi4NbO8Cl nanosheets and g-C3N4. The impact of different reaction parameters on the photocatalytic degradation activities was investigated, including catalyst concentration, pH value and TC concentration. In addition, Bi4NbO8Cl/g-C3N4 also presents improved photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity for CO production. The large enhancement on photocatalytic activity of Bi4NbO8Cl/g-C3N4 composites is owing to the synergistic effect of favorable 2D/2D structure and construction of type II heterojunction with intimate interfacial interaction, thus boosting the charge separation. The formation of type II heterojunction was evidenced by selective photo-deposition of Pt and MnOx, which demonstrate that the reductive sites and oxidative sites are on Bi4NbO8Cl nanosheets and g-C3N4, respectively.

This study develops a dynamic regional air pollution analysis (DRA) model to explore the mechanism of air pollutant emission changes. Specifically, the emissions differences among various sectors are distinguished by multi-angle accounting (MAA) method, and sectors' evolutionary trajectories are described by sector evolution analysis (SEA). Through combining emission deconstruction analysis (EDA) and structural decomposition analysis (SDA), key emission patterns and decisive socioeconomic factors are identified. The empirical results indicate that different sectors play different roles in the urban emission system and differentiated regulation policies should be formulated according to their characteristics. Changes of demand and supply patterns can result in the fluctuation in regional air pollutant emissions. Exports and worker's reward are the most significant contributors to air pollution on demand and supply sides, accounting for more than 54.3% and 44.0% of total emissions, respectively. The final demand level and the primary input level are the two biggest drivers of the emission increase, while emission intensity is the most crucial factor that offsets the emission growth. Also, there are significant differences in demand and supply structure. The contribution of primary input structure to emission reduction was more significant than that of final demand structure, which contributed 14.6% in 2015.

It focuses on a regional measurement and comparison of these undesirable outputs of Chinese firm activities, such as industrial SO2 and CO2 emissions. By applying a data envelopment analysis-slack-based measure (DEA-SBM) model with undesirable outputs indicators, the regional innovation efficiency was evaluated for 30 provinces in China, from 2002 to 2014. The results indicate that the sustainable innovation efficiency of overall China is still relatively low, and varies significantly in different regions. Central and Western China have similar sustainable innovation efficiencies, which are much lower than the sustainable innovation efficiency in Eastern China. Furthermore, the data indicate that regional sustainable innovation efficiency disparities among these three areas are decreasing. Based on these findings, reasons for the sustainable innovation efficiency gap among the different regions were analyzed. To scholars, this paper extends the research on regional sustainable innovation efficiency by implementing an undesirable output perspective to the DEA-SBM model. The findings also provide Chinese policy makers with useful decision support insights for regional sustainable innovation, and energy conservation and emission reduction policies. © 2019 by the authors.","Regional disparities; Regional sustainable innovation efficiency; Slack-based measure model; Undesirable outputs","energy conservation; firm size; industrial waste; model; policy making; sustainability; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079643496

To obtain the accurate forecasting of DF cases, it is crucial to model the long-term dependency in time series data, which is difficult for a typical machine learning method. This study aimed to develop a timely accurate forecasting model of dengue based on long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks while only considering monthly dengue cases and climate factors. The performance of LSTM models was compared with the other previously published models when predicting DF cases one month into the future. Our results showed that the LSTM model reduced the average the root mean squared error (RMSE) of the predictions by 12.99% to 24.91% and reduced the average RMSE of the predictions in the outbreak period by 15.09% to 26.82% as compared with other candidate models. The LSTM model achieved superior performance in predicting dengue cases as compared with other previously published forecasting models. Moreover, transfer learning (TL) can improve the generalization ability of the model in areas with fewer dengue incidences. The findings provide a more precise forecasting dengue model and could be used for other dengue-like infectious diseases. © 2020 by the authors.

On this basis, the spatial and temporal variations in NO2 column concentrations were analyzed over China from 1997 to 2018. The results show that the reconstructed NO2 column concentration dataset with high spatial structure characteristics in China from 1997 to 2018 effectively compensates for the lack of long-term high-resolution monitoring of NO2 pollution in China by a single satellite. (The accuracy of the reconstructed dataset was verified by season: correlation coefficient between GOME and SCIAMACHY, R &gt; 0.87, P &lt; 0.01; correlation coefficient between GOME2A and SCIAMACHY, R &gt; 0.91, P &lt; 0.01.) The analysis of the spatial and temporal variations showed that the NO2 column concentrations in China from 1997 to 2018 generally showed high values in the east and low values in the west. The high concentrations of NO2 are mainly concentrated in the northern and eastern coastal areas and the Pearl River Delta. From 1997 to 2010, the NO2 column concentrations continued to increase with a growth rate of (0.180 ± 0.011) × 1015 molec / (cm2 a) over China. From 2011 to 2018, the NO2 column concentrations showed a downward trend, with a decreasing rate of (0.144 ± 0.037) × 1015 molec / (cm2 a) over China.

In this study, the dependence of reduction efficiency of the CDs on the irradiation wavelength and their photoluminescence property is investigated. We find that the CDs excited by short wavelength light shows much higher photoreducibility than those excited by longer wavelength irradiation, although their PL intensity might be about the same. By analyzing the PL and the time-resolved PL property of the formed CDs-Ag NPs composites we find that, when the CDs are excited, there are two kinds of recombination path ways of the carriers contributing to their photoluminescence: the direct excitation of surface states, and the excited electrons from carbonic-core transferred to the surface states; only the electrons originates from the intrinsic carbonic-core excited by short wavelength can reduce the Ag ions, while those originates from the direct excitation of the surface states by long wavelength light are ineffective.

Taking Xi'an, a metropolis in northern China, as the case study, we first conducted a 3-year meteorological investigation, including air temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed in both summer and winter. Meanwhile, five indicators with potential impacts on urban climate were selected to describe the urban characteristics. Then, the geographic information system was applied to integrate the meteorological data and urban characteristic data in order to assign more meteorological data. Next, three types of meteorological single-factor and thermal comfort spatial distribution maps were derived. The k-means clustering analysis method was then employed to classify three types of meteorological factors into seven zones in horizontal spatial dimension. Finally, urban climate maps were generated.

To evaluate the joint effects of long-term PM1 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 1.0 μm) exposure and obesity on children's lung function, a cross-sectional sample of 6740 children (aged 7–14 years) was enrolled across seven northeastern Chinese cities from 2012 to 2013. Weight and lung function, including forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and maximal mid-expiratory flow (MMEF), were measured according to standardized protocols. Average PM1, PM2.5, PM10 and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) exposure levels were estimated using a spatiotemporal model, and sulphur dioxide (SO2) and ozone (O3) exposure were estimated using data from municipal air monitoring stations. Two-level logistic regression and general linear models were used to analyze the joint effects of body mass index (BMI) and air pollutants. The results showed that long-term air pollution exposure was associated with lung function impairment and there were significant interactions with BMI. Associations were stronger among obese and overweight than normal weight participants (the adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for PM1 and lung function impairments in three increasing BMI categories were 1.50 (1.07–2.11) to 2.55 (1.59–4.07) for FVC &lt; 85% predicted, 1.44 (1.03–2.01) to 2.51 (1.53–4.11) for FEV1 &lt; 85% predicted, 1.34 (0.97–1.84) to 2.04 (1.24–3.35) for PEF &lt; 75% predicted, and 1.34 (1.01–1.78) to 1.93 (1.26–2.95) for MMEF &lt; 75% predicted). Consistent results were detected in linear regression models for PM1, PM2.5 and SO2 on FVC and FEV1 impairments (PInteraction &lt; 0.05). These modification effects were stronger among females and older participants.

How to reduce haze emission is an urgent problem in China's environmental governance. This paper uses the SBM-Undesirable model, adopting 5 inputs indexes(coal, oil, gas, labor and capital), and 2 outputs indexes GDP and PM2.5 emissions as expected output and unexpected output respectively, to calculate the emission efficiency of PM2.5 in China's 29 provinces. Based on the efficiency evaluation results of SBM-Undesirable model, the reasons for the inefficiency of PM2.5 emission are analyzed. The redundancy rate of investment, the insufficient rate of expected output and the redundancy rate of undesirable outputs are calculated. Results showed that: (1) Most provinces with high PM2.5 emission efficiency are concentrated in the eastern region, while the PM2.5 emission efficiency in the central and western regions is relatively low. (2) The redundancy rate of input variables and undesirable output of the eastern region is lower than that of the western and based on SBM-Undesirable model central regions. This is likely to have a great relationship with the economic development and the high level of technology in the eastern region. This study provides a reference for reducing the haze theory and providing empirical support for the government's haze reduction. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.",,"Ecology; Economic and social effects; Economics; Gas emissions; Redundancy; Atmospheric pollutant emissions; Eastern regions; Economic development; Efficiency evaluation; Emission efficiencies; Environmental governances; Input variables; Urgent problems; Efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078930316

The first SVD mode (here after SVD1) indicates that high precipitation anomalies in Southwest China correspond to abnormally weak convective activity in northeastern MC and strong convective activity in Southwestern MC if the time-series of coefficients of SVD1 is in positive phase. When convective activity are anomalously strong in Southern MC, the anomalous divergence at 700 hPa and convergence at 200 hPa are observed over the tropical western Pacific and South China Sea. The propagation of wave energy at 700 hPa from Western Europe and the tropics provide a favorable condition for inducing more precipitation in most of Southwest China. The atmospheric water vapor transport from northern Indochina and the South China Sea to Southwest China intensifies while the western Pacific subtropical high is stronger than normal and extends more westward. All these results along with the simulations demonstrate that the summer precipitation in Southwest China is significantly affected by the convective activity over the MC region. These results above are helpful for our better understanding the role of the MC in regulating the summer climate in Southwest China. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Boreal summer; Maritime Continent; Outgoing longwave radiation; Precipitation; Southwest China","annual variation; atmospheric convection; longwave radiation; precipitation assessment; seasonal variation; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075245710

The configuration of anode-supported nickel-yttrial stablized zirconia (Ni-YSZ), YSZ (yttrial stablized zirconia) electrolyte, LSM-YSZ (lanthanum strontium manganite-yttrial stablized zirconia) cathode, was fabricated into tubular cell with 13 mm in length and inner diameters 5 mm. Three carbonaceous materials, including activated carbon (AC), carbon black (BC) and graphite (GC), were investigated with regard to specific area, functional group, thermal activity and morphology by means of N2-BET, FT-IR, TG and SEM, respectively. NO conversion efficiency in excess of 85% can be achieved in the solid state cells driven by AC at 800 °C, higher than cells by BC and GC. BC is one of cheaper carbonaceous material substituting for AC in NO electrochemical reduction, due to its comparable performance. Higher specific area (1745 m2 g−1) and higher content of oxygen-containing functional groups assigned to AC contributes to the better electrochemical behaviours evidenced by AC impedance spectra. Similar thermal activities can be observed both for AC and BC.

In the present work, biogenic emissions from China in 2017 were estimated based on the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN). The effects of BVOC emissions on ozone and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation were investigated using the WRF-CMAQ modeling system. Three parallel scenarios were developed to assess the impact of BVOC emissions on China's ozone and SOA formation in July 2017. Biogenic emissions were estimated at 23.54 Tg/yr, with a peak in the summer and decreasing from southern to northern China. The high BVOC emissions across eastern and southwestern China increased the surface ozone levels, particularly in the BTH (Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei), SCB (Sichuan Basin), YRD (Yangtze River Delta) and central PRD (Pearl River Delta) regions, with increases of up to 47 μg m−3 due to the sensitivity of VOC-limited urban areas. In summer, most SOA concentrations formed over China are from biogenic sources (national average of 70%). And SOA concentrations in YRD and SCB regions are generally higher than other regions. Excluding anthropogenic emissions while keeping biogenic emissions unchanged results that SOA concentrations reduce by 60% over China, which indicates that anthropogenic emissions can interact with biogenic emissions then facilitate biogenic SOA formation. It is suggested that controlling anthropogenic emissions would result in reduction of both anthropogenic and biogenic SOA. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","BVOC; MEGAN; Modeling; Ozone; SOA","Aerosols; Models; Volatile organic compounds; Anthropogenic emissions; Biogenic volatile organic compounds; BVOC; Environmental chemistry; MEGAN; Pearl River delta; Secondary organic aerosols; Yangtze river delta; Ozone; aerosol; atmospheric chemistry; biogenic emission; concentration (composition); modeling; ozone; volatile organic compound; Beijing [China]; China; Guangdong; Hebei; Sichuan Basin; Tianjin; Yangtze Delta; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071920369

Previous studies have proven that the structural decomposition analysis (SDA) method is an effective way to examine and identify the drivers of CO2 emissions. Nevertheless, the traditional SDA approach does not entirely consider the spatio-temporal variation of CO2 driving factors. We thus propose a new spatial-temporal structure decomposition analysis (ST-SDA) method in this study to identify the driving factors and examine the spatio-temporal variation of CO2 emissions at provinces level from 1997 to 2012. It is prominent because it integrates the temporal and spatial dimensions to decompose the influencing factors across regions and over time simultaneously. The decomposition results for the whole China and its 30 provinces show that the final demand aggregate effect is the main driver of boosting CO2 emissions except for Ningxia, which indicates that the expansion of industrial production scales driven by demand of product consumption promotes the increase of CO2 emissions. The results also present that the carbon intensity effect is the only factor to offset the growth of CO2 emissions, which demonstrates that technological progress contributes continuously to the reduction of CO2 emissions, especially in eastern and northern coastal areas.

In Hong Kong, conventional liquefied petroleum gas taxis are one of the main contributors to roadside emissions as they operate on the streets 24 h a day with a long daily driving mileage. Moreover, these taxis suffer from a severely poor service reputation. To enhance the environmental friendliness and service quality of the taxi industry, this study explores the market potential of operating premium electric taxis in the dispatching mode. A stated preference survey was conducted to 1410 taxi customers about their taxi-riding choices between premium electric taxis and conventional liquefied petroleum gas taxis. In total, 5640 observations were obtained and used to develop a series of binary logistic regression models with different model formulations for the determination of the significant factors influencing customers’ selections. The findings indicate that walk time to and wait time for taxis were the most critical concerns to the customers, and they were more willing to take premium taxis if their journey distance was longer and their desired improvement on taxi service quality was greater. The socio-demographic status of taxi customers also influences their choices. The associated policy implications are discussed for promoting taxis with better service quality and fewer roadside emissions. The findings provide some policy insights to other international cities that have a similar taxi market to Hong Kong. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Premium taxis; Public transport service quality; Taxi customers’ selections; Vehículos eléctricos de batería; Émissions de gaz à effet de serre en bordure de route","Commerce; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Liquefied petroleum gas; Public policy; Quality of service; Regression analysis; Roadsides; Taxicabs; Binary logistic regression models; Environmental friendliness; Metropolitan cities; Model formulation; Policy implications; Public transport service; Service reputation; Stated preference surveys; Sales; electric vehicle; liquefied petroleum gas; metropolitan area; public transport; service quality; taxi transport; travel behavior; urban transport; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076506927

Accurate monitoring of air quality is difficult due to intrinsic urban landscape heterogeneity and superposition of multiple polluting sources. Existing approaches often do not provide the necessary spatial details and peak concentrations of pollutants, especially at larger distances from monitoring stations. A more advanced integrated approach is needed. This study presents a very high-resolution air quality assessment with the Parallelized Large-Eddy Simulation Model (PALM), capitalising on local measurements. This fully three-dimensional primitive-equation hydrodynamical model resolves both structural details of the complex urban surface and turbulent eddies larger than 10 m in size. We ran a set of 27 meteorological weather scenarios in order to assess the dispersion of pollutants in Bergen, a middle-sized Norwegian city embedded in a coastal valley. This set of scenarios represents typically observed weather conditions with high air pollution from nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and particulate matter (PM2:5). The modelling methodology helped to identify pathways and patterns of air pollution caused by the three main local air pollution sources in the city. These are road vehicle traffic, domestic house heating with woodburning fireplaces and ships docked in the harbour area next to the city centre. The study produced vulnerability maps, highlighting the most impacted districts for each weather and emission scenario. Overall, the largest contribution to air pollution over inhabited areas in Bergen was caused by road traffic emissions for NO2 and wood-burning fireplaces for PM2:5 pollution. The effect of emission from ships in the port was mostly restricted to the areas close to the harbour and moderate in comparison. However, the results have contributed to implementation of measures to reduce emissions from ships in Bergen harbour, including provision of shore power. © 2020 Author(s).",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; environmental assessment; environmental monitoring; modeling; nitrogen dioxide; particulate matter; pollutant source; urban atmosphere; Bergen; Hordaland; Norway",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078402771

Soil organic carbon typically constitutes the largest carbon stock in floodplains in fire-prone regions, although downed wood can contain significant organic carbon. We focus on the influence of wildfire on soil organic carbon and downed wood as opposed to standing vegetation to emphasize the geomorphic influences resulting from wildfire on floodplain organic carbon stocks. The net effect of wildfire varies depending on site-specific characteristics including climate and valley geometry. Wildfire is likely to reduce carbon stock in steep, confined valley segments because increased water and sediment yields following fire create net floodplain erosion. The net effect of fire in partly confined valleys depends on site-specific interactions among floodplain aggradation and erosion, and, in high-latitude regions, permafrost degradation. In unconfined valleys in temperate latitudes, wildfire is likely to slightly increase floodplain organic carbon stock as a result of floodplain aggradation and wood deposition. In unconfined valleys in high latitudes underlain by permafrost, wildfire is likely in the short-term to significantly decrease floodplain organic carbon via permafrost degradation and reduce organic-layer thickness. Permafrost degradation reduces floodplain erosional resistance, leading to enhanced stream bank erosion and greater carbon fluxes into channels. The implications of warming climate and increased wildfires for floodplain organic carbon stock thus vary. Increasing wildfire extent, frequency, and severity may result in significant redistribution of organic carbon from floodplains to the atmosphere via combustion in all environments examined here, as well as redistribution from upper to lower portions of watersheds in the temperate zone and from floodplains to the oceans via riverine transport in the high-latitudes. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","aggradation; erosion; large wood; permafrost; soil organic carbon; wildfire","Banks (bodies of water); Climate models; Erosion; Fires; Floods; Permafrost; Rivers; Upper atmosphere; Wood; aggradation; Fire-prone environments; Organic carbon storages; Permafrost degradation; Site specific characteristics; Site-specific interactions; Soil organic carbon; wildfire; Organic carbon; aggradation; erosion; floodplain; fluvial geomorphology; organic carbon; permafrost; soil organic matter; warming; wildfire; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068930894

Study design: Using data from the Guttmacher Institute's 2017 Abortion Provider Census, we examine amount charged for abortion care, pregnancy gestation at which abortions were offered, number of days per week that clinics provided abortions and types of nonabortion services offered. Our analysis focuses on the 808 clinic facilities that provided 95% of abortions that year. Measures were calculated nationally and according to whether the clinic was in a state we categorized as hostile, middle ground or supportive of abortion rights. Results: In 2017, 64% of clinics offered abortion at 11 weeks pregnancy gestation, and 22% did so at 20 weeks gestation. Supportive states had a higher density of clinics that provide abortion for every measured gestation than hostile states. Clinics charged an average of $549 for a surgical abortion at 10 weeks and $551 for medication abortion. Some 46% of clinics in supportive states offered abortion care 5 or more days per week compared to 29% in hostile states. Most clinics offered standalone contraception and family planning (87%) and gynecological care (85%), but the proportion of clinics that provided these services was higher in supportive states (93% and 90%) than in hostile states (75% and 73%). Conclusions: A substantial proportion of abortion facilities provide a range of other health care services. Aspects of service delivery, such as number of days abortions are provided, may vary according to abortion policy climate. Implications statement: Onerous policies in states hostile to abortion rights may inhibit some facilities from providing abortion more days per week, and if so, could further burden patients obtaining abortion care in these states. © 2020 The Authors","Abortion; Abortion clinics; Abortion cost; Health care access; Policy","adult; article; climate; contraception; controlled study; family planning; female; gynecologic care; health care access; human; medical abortion; pregnancy; surgical abortion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095439827

Modeled largely on the Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) operated by California, the CFP sets a declining target for the average life cycle carbon intensity (CI) of transportation fuels used in the state. The CFP incentivizes the deployment of emissions-reducing fuels and vehicles, and can contribute toward economy-wide greenhouse gas reduction goals. This paper reviews program data from the first three years of the CFP’s operation, provides an overview of program characteristics, identifies key trends, and compares the CFP to the LCFS. While it is early in the program’s operational history and CI reduction targets are small, the available data indicate a program functioning as expected based on the experience of jurisdictions with similar programs. Aggregate emissions reductions have slightly exceeded targets resulting in the accumulation of a small bank of credits. Early compliance has largely been driven by blending of ethanol into retail gasoline and the introduction of greater volumes of diesel substitutes. Electric vehicles are a small but rapidly growing contributor to compliance. As targets grow more stringent, compliance will require greater volumes of low carbon fuels to be brought to market. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",,"Blending; Carbon; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Carbon intensity; Diesel substitutes; Emissions reduction; Greenhouse gas reductions; Low carbon fuels; Reduction targets; Status updates; Transportation fuels; Fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103788729

We find that the ability to substitute lumber-based building materials increases production from the lumber and forestry sectors and decreases production from carbon-intensive sectors such as cement. Under a carbon cap-and-trade policy, the ability to substitute lumber products lowers the carbon price and the GDP cost of meeting the carbon cap, with more overall emissions abatement in the construction industry.

However, the statistical properties of air pollutants are not fully understood. Here, we use methods borrowed from nonequilibrium statistical mechanics to construct suitable superstatistical models for air pollution statistics. In particular, we analyze time series of nitritic oxide (NO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations recorded at several locations throughout Greater London. We find that the probability distributions of concentrations have heavy tails and that the dynamics is well described by χ2 superstatistics for NO and inverse-χ2 superstatistics for NO2.

Although there has been an initial implementation of the integrated strategy at the national level, the progress of its adoption at the local level is relatively less studied. The study aims to examine the integration development of climate adaptation measures into urban development strategies by looking at its drivers and benefits in two coastal cities of Indonesia, i.e., Semarang and Bandar Lampung. Both cities have experienced climate change impacts and the preliminary effort of the integration process. The study was depended on close-ended Likert-scale questions with key actors representing local authorities and relevant stakeholders. Then, a Weighted Average Index was applied to transform their perceptions. The assessment of their knowledge of related issues was conducted. Secondary data was obtained from a desk study. The study found out that the effort of the integration process had influenced stakeholder's understanding of the issue of climate change and urban development, as well as its relationship. The level of stakeholder's knowledge related to the issue was very high. The result also revealed that the most influencing driver of the integration process is related to the motivation and initiative of municipal officers. It significantly contributed local governments to adopt its integration strategy. There was a strong consensus regarding the benefits of the integration process. They believed that it could ensure sustainable urban development in the future. This empirical study distinguishes the significance of integration development based on the local perspective for the approach improvement. The results could be applied to encourage other local municipalities in other emerging coastal cities. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate adaptation; Coastal city; Drivers and benefits; Integration progress; Local perspective","adaptive management; climate change; development strategy; holistic approach; integrated approach; stakeholder; strategic approach; urban area; urban development; Bandar Lampung; Central Java; Indonesia; Lampung; Semarang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079637263

These grants call for the California Department of Transportation (Caltrans) to fund planning projects that address multimodal transportation deficiencies with a focus on transit. In 2016, Caltrans awarded the San Diego Association of Governments (SANDAG) a Strategic Partnerships planning grant to develop the Mobility Management Toolbox (Toolbox). SANDAG partnered with ICF to develop the Toolbox to help jurisdictions and developers within the San Diego region calculate the potential vehicle miles traveled (VMT) reductions of various mobility management strategies, including Transportation Demand Management (TDM) and Transportation System Management (TSM). The Toolbox provides a regional common framework for evaluating and implementing mobility management strategies as part of the development review process and for mitigating GHG, transportation, air quality, and energy impacts, as required under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The Toolbox also supports the transition from a level of service (LOS) metric to VMT as mandated by SB 743 (Steinberg, 2013) and with Climate Action Plan (CAP) implementation and monitoring. Application of the Toolbox extends beyond the San Diego and California region and can support other municipalities within the United States (U.S.) to reduce GHG emissions from the transportation sector. © 2020 Bracing for Climate Change: Strategies for Mitigation and Resiliency Planning Conference Proceedings.

This paper presents the methods used, with the aim of informing others who wish to conduct similar work in the future, and some results, including policy impact. We used three interlinked methods: 1) a personal mobile exposure monitoring campaign in which individual workers used Dylos monitors to measure variations in their exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) within the settlement over the course of a day, 2) a questionnaire conducted before and after the monitoring campaign to assess any changes in knowledge or attitude in the wider community, and 3) two workshops, which facilitated the citizen science approach and brought together members of the community, local policy makers and researchers. The three elements of the study provided the local community, policymakers and scientists with new insights into the challenges air pollution poses for human health in such settlements, and opportunities for exploring how to monitor, mitigate and avoid these pollutants using a citizen science approach. We found significant differences in PM2.5 exposure between individual workers that could be partially explained by spatial differences in concentration that we identified within the settlement. Residents of the informal settlement identified a number of sources that might explain these differences in concentration, although many residents perceived air quality to be good both indoors and outdoors. The workshops raised awareness of the issue of air pollution and brought together affected community members and local and national policy makers to discuss air pollution issues in Nairobi's informal settlements. As a result, a new knowledge exchange network, the Kenya Air Quality Network, of policy-makers, researchers and community members was formed with the aim to facilitate the improvement of air quality across Kenya. © 2019","Air pollution; Citizen science; Informal settlements; Policy engagement; Sub-Saharan Africa","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); environmental policy; informal settlement; particulate matter; policy making; pollution exposure; Kenya; Nairobi [Kenya]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076050482

Several vascular risk factors such as hypertension or diabetes dampen this response, making cerebrovascular reactivity a useful diagnostic marker for incipient vascular pathology, but its functional relevance, if any, is still unclear. Here, we found that GPR4, an endothelial H+ receptor, and endothelial Gαq/11 proteins mediate the CO2/H+ effect on cerebrovascular reactivity in mice. CO2/H+ leads to constriction of vessels in the brainstem area that controls respiration. The consequential washout of CO2, if cerebrovascular reactivity is impaired, reduces respiration. In contrast, CO2 dilates vessels in other brain areas such as the amygdala. Hence, an impaired cerebrovascular reactivity amplifies the CO2 effect on anxiety. Even at atmospheric CO2 concentrations, impaired cerebrovascular reactivity caused longer apneic episodes and more anxiety, indicating that cerebrovascular reactivity is essential for normal brain function. The site-specific reactivity of vessels to CO2 is reflected by regional differences in their gene expression and the release of vasoactive factors from endothelial cells. Our data suggest the central nervous system (CNS) endothelium as a target to treat respiratory and affective disorders associated with vascular diseases. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

As a result of closer interregional economic connections, embodied carbon emissions are transferred among provinces via inter-provincial trade, resulting in carbon leakage. China usually adopts a production-based principle to evaluate the realization of carbon intensity reduction targets for disparate provinces. The carbon dioxide emission reduction targets from a consumption-based accounting were re-examined, and compared two methods that have been applied. From 2002 to 2007, the rankings of carbon dioxide emission intensity variation rates from production-based and consumption-based accounting resulted in different province rankings and, although the gaps in the rankings between both methods changed between 2007 and 2012, particularly in Guizhou and Yunnan. Because the production-based calculation ignores carbon leakage and is ineffective in accurately assessing reduction targets, these targets were re-examined from a consumption-based accounting. These findings are very significant for China's policies on carbon dioxide emissions reduction: the provinces’ targets on reducing carbon dioxide emissions may be evaluated rationally with regard to inter-provincial carbon leakage in China; kinds of support for the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions can favor less developed regions; and encouraging economic mechanics for technological innovations assist in managing carbon dioxide emissions at the national scale. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide emission intensity reduction targets; China; Embodied carbon; Inter-provincial trade; Multi-regional input-output (MRIO)","Commerce; Emission control; Global warming; Carbon dioxide emission intensity; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon intensity reductions; China; Embodied carbons; Input-output; Less-developed regions; Technological innovation; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073218729

This paper combines two-layer LMDI (logarithmic mean divisia index) method and spectral clustering to analyze industrial CO2 emission drivers in 30 provinces of China and proposes carbon reduction policies. First, each province's industrial CO2 emission factors are decomposed into energy structure, energy intensity, industrialization level, per capita GDP and total population; energy intensity and per capita GDP play a dominant role in suppressing and promoting industrial CO2 emissions, respectively. The industrialization level has gradually developed from the eastern coastal areas to the north and the central and western regions, especially Inner Mongolia, Jilin, Henan and Sichuan. The impact mechanisms of the provinces on China's CO2 emissions are very different from temporal and spatial angle. Second, this paper optimizes spectral clustering though geodesic distance and utilizes it to cluster 30 provinces in China.

However, during the preparation of single-atom catalysts, some metal nanoparticles (NPs) are inevitably generated, which suffer from low selectivity in CO2RR. In this regard, complex postprocessing solution treatments are usually conducted to remove metal NPs using acid. Herein, we fabricated Ni(NC)-based catalysts composed of single Ni atoms and Ni NPs, both of which feature local Ni-N coordination via a simple Ni-metal organic framework (MOF)-assisted strategy. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy measurements, nitrogen species in N-doped carbon have been demonstrated to be coordinated with surface nickel species to form Ni-N motifs, which makes Ni at a low-valent state for efficient CO2RR. Consequently, the catalyst exhibited high performances toward CO2RR with CO Faradic efficiencies (FECO) maintained over 90% from -0.65 to -0.90 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE). More importantly, the FECO of 99% could be obtained at a considerable current density (j) of -160 mA cm-2 in a flow cell configuration. These findings suggest that regulating the surface environment of Ni species can activate the original inert reaction sites into active reaction sites, providing a promising avenue to design high-performance electrocatalysts for CO2RR.

In the context of power markets, this translates into regions that coordinate to maximize welfare in the power market with respect to a climate target. Yet, the maximization of overall welfare through cooperation leads to redistribution and can result in the reduction of a region's welfare compared to the case without cooperation. This paper assesses why cooperation in the European power market is not stable from the perspective of single regions and identifies cost allocations that increase fairness. In a first step, the EU-REGEN model is applied to find the future equilibrium outcome of the European power market under a cooperative, subadditive cost sharing game. Second, resulting cost allocations are analyzed by means of cooperative game theory concepts. Results show that the value of cooperation under a tight emission reduction target is a € 69 billion reduction in discounted system cost over the next 30 years, and rational behavior of regions can maintain at most 16% of this cost reduction. The evaluation of alternative cost allocations reveals the trade-off between accounting for robustness against cost changes and individual rationality. Moreover, the cost-efficient decarbonization path of the European power sector under the grand coalition is characterized by the interplay between wind power, gas power, and biomass with geologic storage of CO2. With singleton coalitions only, the market outcome shifts to a higher contribution from nuclear power. The findings of this analysis suggest that future EU regulation should include more comprehensive transfer schemes to facilitate the efficient implementation of a transformation path. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Cooperative game theory; Cost sharing; Energy modeling; European power market; Investment planning","Cost accounting; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Decarbonization; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Game theory; Nuclear fuels; Power markets; Wind power; Cooperative game theory; Cost sharing; Efficient implementation; Emission reduction targets; Energy model; Individual rationality; Investment planning; Transformation paths; Investments; cooperative sector; cost analysis; energy efficiency; energy market; game theory; investment; power plant; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069040350

From these temperatures, the neutral densities in the thermosphere can be calculated, through use of the Naval Research Laboratory Mass Spectrometer and Incoherent Scatter radar Extended (NRLMSISE-00) model. The exospheric temperature model is derived from measurements of the neutral densities on several satellites. These data were sorted into triangular cells on a geodesic grid, based on location. Prediction equations are derived for each grid cell using least error fits. Several versions of the model equations have been tested, using parameters such as the date, time, solar radiation, and nitric oxide emissions, as measured with the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on the Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. Accuracy is improved with the addition of the total Poynting flux flowing into the polar regions, from an empirical model that uses the solar wind velocity and interplanetary magnetic field. Given such inputs, the model can produce global maps of the exospheric temperature. These maps show variations in the polar regions that are strongly modulated by the time of day, due to the daily rotation of the magnetic poles. For convenience the new model is referred to with the acronym EXTEMPLAR (EXospheric TEMperatures on a PoLyhedrAl gRid). Neutral densities computed from the EXTEMPLAR-NRLMSISE-00 models combined are found to produce very good results when compared with measured values. © 2019.

The computational model was employed to calculate the combustion process of the biogas-hydrogen flame, and four major routes to produce the NO were isolated and calculated in the simulations. The effects of H2 addition on the formations and emissions of CO/NO2/NOx of BG75-hydrogen impinging flames were analyzed quantitatively. The results show that, with the H2 addition, the EICO of BG75-hydrogen flame is enhanced steadily at either small separated distance (H) or large H thanks to that the high reactivity of H2 suppresses the CO oxidization efficiently by competing for the OH radical. The H2 addition can improve the NO production via four routes and increase the EINOx of the BG75-hydrogen flame. Although the prompt NO is improved by the H2 addition, its rising trend is decreased considerably as hydrogen addition is larger than 20% owing to the reduced methane proportion and improved premixed combustion. The contribution of prompt NO is decreased with the H2 addition, while that of other routes are increased steadily. The NNH route dominates the increased EINOx at small H while the thermal route dominates the rising trend at large H. EINO2 is enhanced steadily with the H2 addition due to the improved HO2 production in the air mixing region, while the NO2 conversion ratio is improved and suppressed with H2 addition at small and large H, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas-hydrogen blends; CO and NOx; Emission formation; Flame impingement; H2 effects; Overall emission","Biogas; Free radicals; Nitrogen oxides; Combustion pro-cess; Computational model; Flame impingement; Flame-wall interaction; H2 effects; Hydrogen addition; Laminar premixed; Premixed combustion; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072831933

However, it is challenging to achieve high reaction rates while maintaining good selectivity. Here, we used an H2 bubble-templated electrodeposition method in a thiocyanate (SCN)-containing aqueous electrolyte to synthesize a hierarchically porous Ag nanofoam (AgNF) with curved Ag surfaces modified by SCN. This AgNF demonstrates excellent performance for CO2 reduction with a high CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 97%. It can maintain over 90% FECO in a wide potential window (-0.5 to -1.2 VRHE), enabling the maximum CO selective current density of 33 mA cm-2 and the mass activity of 23.5 A gAg -1, which are the highest values among recently reported Ag-based electrocatalysts. Mechanism studies reveal that the catalytic performance of the AgNF correlates with the density of surface SCN ligands, which exhibit excellent electrochemical stability under negative potentials. Density functional theory calculations suggest that SCN ligands promote the formation of COOH∗ intermediates by modifying the local electron density at the active sites. Further, the synthesis method is applicable to different catalyst substrates. For example, the AgNF grown on a carbon-based gas diffusion film exhibits an ultrahigh mass activity of 52.1 A gAg -1 and maintains its high CO selectivity simultaneously, demonstrating excellent potentials for practical applications. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","CO2 reduction; electrodeposition; nanofoam; silver; thiocyanate","Carbon dioxide; Density functional theory; Electrocatalysts; Electrodeposition; Electrodes; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Ligands; Reaction rates; CO2 reduction; Electrochemical reductions; Electrochemical stabilities; Faradaic efficiencies; Hierarchically porous; Nano-foam; Templated electrodeposition; thiocyanate; Silver",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078664843

These measurements can include high uncertainties and might obscure the quantification of N2O fluxes. Advances in micrometeorological eddy covariance technique (EC) now allow direct measurements of N2O fluxes at the field scale. Here, we compared N2O emissions calculated from site-specific EFs with N2O flux data derived from year-round EC measurements on an intensively grazed dairy pasture in the Waikato region, NZ. Annual N2O emissions of 7.30 kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1 determined using gap-filled EC flux data were greater than N2O estimates of 3.82 kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1 based on site-specific EFs for cattle urine (1.53%), cattle dung (0.24%) and urea fertiliser (0.16%). Likely reasons for this difference were that the EF approach did not take into account the seasonal variability of EFs, the effect of supplementary feed on cattle nitrogen (N) excretion and background N2O emissions (BNE). Including calculated emissions from supplementary feed N (0.92 kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1) and BNE (1.09 kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1) increased annual EF-based emissions to 5.83 kg N2O-N ha−1 yr−1. The site-specific EFs were established in spring 2017 and may not have adequately represented summer, winter and particularly autumn N2O emissions. The EF approach, therefore, did not fully account for the seasonal variability of N2O fluxes as measured by EC but, if quantified, could have led to further agreement between measurements. Using EC measurements to complement static chambers and EF approaches altered annual N2O emissions estimates from intensively grazed pastoral land. Hence, we conclude that N2O budgets derived from EFs need to better capture the effect of seasonal variability, supplementary feed and BNE. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Greenhouse gas inventory; Intensive agriculture; Nitrous oxide; Quantum cascade laser; Static chamber","dairy farming; detection method; eddy covariance; emission; emission inventory; flux measurement; greenhouse gas; intensive agriculture; laser method; nitrous oxide; seasonal variation; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073072403

We measured institutional quality using government effectiveness and control of corruption indicators. The GMM estimation results indicate that government effectiveness modifies the economic growth-emissions relationship. For low values of this institutional indicator, we found diminishing increments of CO2 emissions as GDP grows. In the case of countries with high government effectiveness, we observed a statistically significant reduction in CO2 emissions only in some specifications. We did not confirm the moderating role of the control of corruption in shaping the economic growth-carbon dioxide emissions nexus. These findings have important policy implications, suggesting that countries should direct efforts to improve the institutional background.

Therefore distribution systems, which were designed initially as passive networks with little monitoring, are evolving into active networks, forcing Distribution System Operators to implement the required Distribution Management Systems control applications. Distribution System State Estimation (DSSE) is a crucial component in Distribution Management Systems. However, despite Transmission System State Estimation being common since its inception in the late 1960s, its methods are not directly transferable to DSSE since transmission systems differ from distribution networks in their operation, design, and topology. This paper develops and tests the performance of Active Distribution System State Estimation Weighted Least Square (WLS) algorithm, which considers the integration of Distributed Generation. The optimum Distributed Generation units placement on the IEEE 33 is evaluated using the Particle Swarm Optimization method. Finally, the state estimation results are compared with real-time load flow results obtained from MATLAB Simulation. © 2020 IEEE.","Active distribution state estimation; IEEE 33 bus test system; Optimal DG placement; PSO; WLS","Climate change; Distributed power generation; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; MATLAB; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Active distribution systems; Active distributions; Bus test systems; Dg placements; Distributed generation units; Distribution management systems; Distribution system state estimations; Particle swarm optimization method; State estimation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082981945

This study extends the aggregate embodied energy/emission intensity measures proposed by Su and Ang (2017) to a national multi-region setting, defines the aggregate embodied CO2 emission intensity (AECI) indicators at the aggregate, provincial, and final demand category levels from the demand perspective, and adopts multiplicative structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to identify the driving factors of the historical changes over the 2007–2012 period in China. On the basis of China's latest multiregion input-output tables, we find that (a) the AECIs show heterogeneities across the provinces and final demand categories, with the AECIs of inland provinces higher than those of coastal provinces and the AECIs of investment and export higher than those of consumption; (b) the generally downward trends of the AECIs hold at different levels, and the improvements in carbon emission performances are more pronounced in inland provinces, presenting a convergence toward the levels of developed coastal provinces; (c) according to the multiplicative SDA results, the input structure effect and the emission intensity effect generally contribute to the decline of AECIs.

End-of-pipe measures have been implemented to mitigate air pollutant emissions in different industrial sectors. However, interregional trade can lead to geological separation of the stages of supply chains (i.e., primary input, production, final sale and consumption), and thus, emissions can be driven by cross-regional drivers (i.e., primary inputs, final sales and consumption), and pollutants can transfer among regions via supply chains. Inequity exists in production-side measures of emission reductions, which do not account for the effects of cross-regional drivers. In this study, we use a multiregional input-output model in the year 2012 to calculate the emissions driven by cross-regional drivers and to trace emission flows along supply chains in China, aiming to inform policymaking on fine particulate matter (PM2.5) mitigation and to provide additional information about shared responsibilities among provinces. We find that the Central (including Anhui and Henan) is the largest emitter outside the Central Coast in order to meet the demand for sales within the Central Coast. Specifically, the cross-provincial sale of products from the construction sector drives massive emissions, especially in Jiangsu province (located in the Central Coast). Therefore, the Central Coast should bear some responsibility to help provinces located in the Central reduce emissions. About half of emissions driven by primary inputs in Beijing-Tianjin are emitted in other regions. However, in general, emissions (except for ammonia) are more likely to be driven by final sales of other provinces than by primary inputs. The supply chain perspective can help gain a better understanding of the impacts of trade-related drivers on emission patterns and advocate just and effective policies considering cleaner production and shared responsibilities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Green consumption; Input-output model; Mitigation policy; Trade","Ammonia; Commerce; Construction industry; Emission control; Public policy; Sales; Supply chains; Air pollutant emission; Construction sectors; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Green consumption; Input output model; Mitigation policies; Pollution emissions; Shared responsibility; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073107236

To address this problem, we select the basic index of service industry CERM based on the Kaya identity, measure the CERM in China's service industry from 2006 to 2015 by using a grey relational model, and analyse the spatial pattern of its evolution by applying the spatial auto-correlation method. The results show that: the average level of CERM in China's service industry is between 0.379 and 0.766, which shows a spatial imbalance. Provinces with high maturity are found in eastern coastal areas, and on the contrary, those with low maturity are found in the western district where the economy is less developed, which shows a decreasing tendency from coastal regions to inland and from eastern areas to the middle and western areas. From the spatial auto-correlation perspective, service industry CERM in China shows spatial aggregation.

To study the relationship between carbon emissions and economic growth of China's iron and steel (IS) industry, this paper first measures the decoupling relationship between carbon emissions and added value of the IS industry from 2001 to 2016 based on the Tapio decoupling model. The causal-chain decomposition model is then used to decompose the decoupling index into different factors. Results show that carbon emissions and economic growth of the IS industry have mostly weak decoupling. For the influencing factors, decoupling elasticities of emission reduction and value creation exert negative impacts on overall decoupling, and the former one plays a bigger role. Decoupling elasticities of energy electricity and industrial electrification positively improve the total decoupling, but the effect is not stable yet and needs to be further enhanced. Finally, the grey Verhulst model is used to predict the decoupling state by the end of 2025. Forecasting results show that industry will still be in a weak decoupling, but the decoupling state will get better over time. Corresponding policy suggestions are posited based on the empirical findings to facilitate the green and low-carbon development of the IS industry. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; China's iron and steel (IS) industry; Grey Verhulst model; Tapio decoupling model","Carbon; Decomposition; Elasticity; Emission control; Green manufacturing; Iron and steel industry; Steelmaking; Carbon emissions; Decomposition model; Decoupling models; Grey Verhulst model; Iron and steel; Low-carbon development; Low-carbon industries; Sustainable economy; Industrial economics; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; iron and steel industry; air pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; China; decomposition; economic development; energy conservation; energy cost; forecasting; iron and steel industry; prediction; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072971963

However, estimating the background PM2.5 concentration via background monitoring sites for a densely populated region (e.g., Taiwan) has been a challenge. In this study, we compared two statistical methods of estimating the background concentration using an 11-year time series (2005–2016) of data from three air-quality stations in Taiwan. The results of two methods showed good agreement for the background PM2.5 concentration estimation, which was about 4.4 μg m−3 and comparable to literature reports. According to the trend analysis, the concentration has decreased at a rate of 1–2 μg m−3 decade−1 as a result of better emissions control in East Asia in recent years. Furthermore, the local concentration can exceed the regional background value by up to 5 times due to local emissions, topographic effects, and weather regimes. When considering the cross-county transport of PM2.5, a difference as high as 5 μg m−3 exists between two prevailing-wind scenarios. This study provides crucial information to policy-makers on setting an achievable and reasonable goal for PM2.5 reduction. © 2019","Air-quality monitoring networks; Background level; Hidden Markov Model; PM2.5 concentration","Air quality; Hidden Markov models; Air quality monitoring networks; Background concentration; Background level; Background monitoring sites; Combined emissions; Densely populated regions; PM2.5 concentration; Topographic effects; Quality control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; emission inventory; estimation method; Markov chain; particulate matter; policy making; pollution monitoring; quantitative analysis; size distribution; trend analysis; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071522852

The extraordinary variability and richness of their structures afford engineering synergies between the metal nodes, functional linkers, encapsulated substrates, or nanoparticles for multiple and selective heterogeneous interactions and activations in these MOF-based nanocatalysts. Pyrolysis of MOF-nanoparticle composites forms highly porous N- or P-doped graphitized MOF-derived nanomaterials that are increasingly used as efficient catalysts especially in electro- and photocatalysis. This review first briefly summarizes this background of MOF nanoparticle catalysis and then comprehensively reviews the fast-growing literature reported during the last years. The major parts are catalysis of organic and molecular reactions, electrocatalysis, photocatalysis, and views of prospects. Major challenges of our society are addressed using these well-defined heterogeneous catalysts in the fields of synthesis, energy, and environment.

This study investigated the microstructure changes of sI methane hydrate and the laws of stress-strain evolution under the condition of compression and tension by using MD simulation. This study further explored the mechanical property and stability of sI methane hydrate under different stress states. Results showed that tensile and compressive failures produced an obvious size effect under a certain condition. At low temperature and high pressure, most of the clathrate hydrate maintained a stable structure in the tensile fracture process, during which only a small amount of unstable methane broke the structure, thereby, presenting a free-motion state. The methane hydrate cracked when the system reached the maximum stress in the loading process, in which the maximum compressive stress is larger than the tensile stress under the same experimental condition. This study provides a basis for understanding the microscopic stress characteristics of methane hydrate. © 2020 Qiang Wang et al., published by De Gruyter 2020.","Hydrate deformation; Methane hydrate; Molecular dynamics; Molecular simulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080038131

An accurate service demand forecasting model is essential for system operators to improve vehicle relocation efficiency so as to satisfy uncertain user trip demand. Therefore, this paper studies relevant indicators affecting car-sharing service demand at the operational level and constructs a micro demand forecasting model for one-way electric car-sharing systems. Taking the city of Shanghai as a case study, firstly, 11 raw indicators are hypothesized to be influential when predicting the order volume of car-sharing service and four 11-variate vector autoregression systems under different space-time conditions are established and estimated. Then significant indicators are achieved from 11 raw indicators by conducting Granger causality test. After that, the exact effect mechanism between each indicator and order volume is analyzed by impulse function and the contribution of each indicator to the error of prediction is calculated by variance decomposition. Finally, long short-term memory network is adopted to train historical data of significant indicators to get an accurate prediction of service demand in different stations and time periods. Major findings of this research are (1) Indicators including ‘Driving distance’, ‘Weekday’, ‘Daily highest temperature’, ‘Daily lowest temperature’, and ‘Fee per kilometer’ have no ‘predictive power’ for the demand forecasting model; (2) ‘Car pick-up interval’, ‘Trip time’, ‘Workday or not’, ‘Daily weather condition’, ‘Fee per minute’, and ‘Order volume’ itself are significant indicators but the effect of ‘Workday or not’ and ‘Daily weather condition’ are negligible; (3) The forecasting model based on long short-term network has better prediction performance than other forecasting models; (4) It would be better to exclude irrelevant indicators before constructing the forecasting model. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle; Granger causality test; Station-based car-sharing; Sustainable transportation; Vector autoregression system","Brain; Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Environmental impact; Long short-term memory; Meteorology; Regression analysis; Statistical tests; Time sharing systems; Traffic congestion; Vector spaces; Environmental pollutions; Granger causality test; Prediction performance; Station-based car-sharing; Sustainable transportation; Sustainable transportation systems; Variance decomposition; Vector autoregressions; Weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073736667

The spatial variations in sea surface temperature (SST) between MIS5e and MIS1 can reveal the important differences in the effects of insolation and oceanographic conditions between the two warm periods, which in turns help refine global climate models. In order to quantify the differences, this study calculated the SST for the peak periods of MIS5e (c. 128-113 ka BP) and MIS1 (c. 8-3 ka BP) along the low-latitude western North Pacific margin (18 oN to 26 oN). Together with the previously published data from the South China Sea (9 oN to 19 oN), the results indicate a generally northwards decreasing trend in the two interglacial periods. This latitudinal SST trend in both peak MIS 1 and MIS 5e can be attributed to the strong influence of ocean currents in the studied region. Secondly, the average SST of peak MIS5e is 1.3 ± 0.2 °C higher than that of peak MIS1, suggesting a higher level of insolation during the previous interglacial. However, the above general pattern is complicated by the near-shore and offshore difference in the effects of winter monsoon on oceanic conditions around 20–22 oN. The coastal upwelling near 26 oN during peak MIS5e reduced the SST, whilst the SST was raised as the upwelling ceased during peak MIS1. Finally, the SSTs of the two warm periods are significantly higher than the present SST from 20 oN northwards, implying the influence of winter monsoon cold current in the Taiwan Strait. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Low latitudes; MIS1; MIS5e; Ocean current; SST; Summer insolation; Western North Pacific margin","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Incident solar radiation; Isotopes; Ocean currents; Offshore oil well production; Surface waters; Interglacial periods; Low latitudes; Marine isotope stages; MIS1; MIS5e; Oceanographic conditions; Sea surface temperature (SST); Western North Pacific; Climate models; climate modeling; global climate; interglacial; latitude; marine isotope stage; oceanic current; sea surface temperature; spatial variation; upwelling; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); South China Sea; Taiwan Strait",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074980317

This will impact the power system. However, with appropriate charging and discharging through vehicle-to-grid (V2G) operation, EV batteries could replace some stationary energy storage to provide support for the power system and benefit EV owners. This raises the questions of when and how EV battery storage should be dispatched, taking into account both vehicle users’ and power system requirements and priorities, as well as the constraints of the battery system. This chapter proposes a decentralized dispatch strategy based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) taking into account the relative importance of the different criteria such as cost, battery state of charge (SOC), power system contingency and load levelling. The proposed ARP -based dispatch strategy is tested on an IEEE Reliability Test System (RTS) with different EV numbers and capacities to investigate the efficacy of such an approach. The simulation results demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the strategy. © The Institution of Engineering and Technology 2020.","AHP; Air pollution control; Air pollution reduction; Analytic hierarchy process; Analytic hierarchy process; Battery powered vehicles; Battery storage plants; Charging operation; Decentralized dispatch strategy; Discharging operation; Electric vehicle charging; Electric vehicles; Energy storage; EV battery storage; Ieee reliability test system; Load dispatching; Power system; Power system economics; Power system reliability; RTS; SOC; Stationary energy storage; V2G operation; Vehicle-to-grid; Vehicle-to-grid battery storage dispatch",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114575462

Recognizing the heterogeneity of total factor CO2 emission performances between various industrial sub-sectors is crucial for governments, to enable the compilation of effective industrial CO2 emission reduction policies. To determine the CO2 emission characteristics throughout the industry sectors, Liaoning province was selected as typical heavy industry province for analysis. Based on the input-output data of 37 industrial sub-sectors from 2003 to 2012, the industrial total factor CO2 emission efficiencies and performances were analyzed through data envelopment analysis (DEA) and the Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index. The results show that most sub-sectors have low total factor CO2 emission efficiencies, which indicates that it is difficult for Liaoning’s industry to reduce carbon emissions. The total factor CO2 emission performance of the overall industry declined by 1.85% per year during the study period; this decrease was mainly related to a lack in implementing technical changes. However, efficiency change showed a progressive trend. These findings indicate that to realize carbon reduction in heavy industry provinces within China, it is necessary to focus on expediting technical change. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Data envelopment analysis (DEA); Heavy industrial province; Industrial CO2 emissions; Malmquist-Luenberger productivity index; Total factor CO2 emission performance","Carbon; Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Factor analysis; Productivity; Carbon emissions; CO2 emission reduction; CO2 emissions; Heavy industrial province; Input-output data; Liaoning Province; Malmquist-luenberger productivity indices; Technical change; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data envelopment analysis; energy efficiency; environmental economics; industrial waste; performance assessment; pollution tax; technical change; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077145389

At the country level, ANI in China dropped significantly from 2.90 g NOX/kWh to 2.15 g NOX/kWh from 2000 to 2016. The temporal and spatial decomposition results showed that the major driving forces are the clean energy penetration (Ucp) and thermal power generation efficiency (Uint), which decreased ANI by 10.5% and 7.74% during the study period, respectively. Ucp in the southwestern, central and northwestern regions were the main contributors for ANI reduction. Uint in the eastern region was the main contributor in reducing ANI.

Oxygen vacancy defects were further introduced into Co2AlO4 nanosheets by a mild solvothermal reduction method, resulting in large electrochemical surface area and high active site densities, making the related Co atoms get electrons, and producing more empty orbitals. The positive charge of Co and Al atoms adjacent to the O vacancies in VO-rich Co2AlO4 reduced significantly, that is, more electrons are concentrated on the Co and Al atoms. Those electrons closed to the Fermi level have a promoting effect during the H2O activation.

However, the limited cruising mileage of EVs seriously affects the experience of users. Therefore, from the perspective of optimisation, to achieve an optimal route planning for all EVs in a city level based on energy consumption analysis becomes a non-trivial task. In this study, the authors optimise the route planning of EVs driving on green waveband (GWB) with the consideration of energy consumption. Specifically, by analysing the impact of parameters such as phase difference, velocity and green split, a GWB-based energy consumption model is proposed to improve the energy efficiency of EVs in urban traffic scenarios. On the basis of the model, they then develop a multi-objective route optimisation algorithm to implement a reliable route-planning strategy. Using extensive simulations, the performance of their proposal is evaluated.

However, it is still suffering from low efficiency due to narrow solar-spectrum utilization and sluggish heterogeneous reaction kinetics. In this work, we demonstrate that catalytic reduction of CO2 can be achieved over Au nanoparticles (NPs) deposited rutile under full solar-spectrum irradiation, boosted by solar-heating effect. We found that UV and visible light can initiate the reaction, and the heat from IR light and local surface-plasmon resonance relaxation of Au NPs can boost the reaction kinetically. The apparent activation energy is determined experimentally and is used to explain the superior catalytic activity of Au/rutile to rutile in a kinetic way. We also find the photo-thermal synergy in the Au/rutile system.

Although many studies have focused on mitigating GHG emission through industrial sector optimization and energy efficiency improvement, limited research was conducted to reduce carbon emission based on spatial planning. This paper proposes a comprehensive carbon emission estimation framework based on GIS technology with open data. It presents the spatial distribution of carbon emission on the city scale. The sectors of carbon emissions are mainly attributed to buildings, transportation, vegetation, and residence. Statistic data was applied to estimate the carbon emission in buildings and residence sectors. Transport carbon emission was calculated through a bottom-up method with the support of the logistic regression model and spatial microsimulation. Carbon sequestration of vegetation was estimated by remote sensing technology. Eindhoven was employed as a case study to verify the feasibility of the framework. The results clearly illustrate the carbon balance in association with land use patterns. The new framework can be used to analyze the impact of urban spatial planning on carbon emission. The estimation results can also apply to urban form components (land use, buildings types, and road network) optimization and environmental assessment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Eindhoven; GIS; Land use; Low carbon city; Urban planning","Energy efficiency; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Industrial research; Land use; Motor transportation; Open Data; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Urban planning; Vegetation; Carbon sequestration; Eindhoven; Energy efficiency improvements; Environmental assessment; Logistic Regression modeling; Low-carbon cities; Remote sensing technology; Spatial microsimulation; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073970637

Study Design: Experimental study. Place and Duration of Study: General Department II, Zhongda Hospital, Southeast University, Nanjing, China, from August 2016 to October 2018. Methodology: Eighty cases were enrolled prospectively and divided into three groups in chronological order. A 14 mmHg CO2 pressure was used for negative control group while the pressure was controlled at 12 mmHg for observation group and 10 mmHg for intervention group. General information included the patients' age, gender, type of hernia, hernia defect size, dissection of inguinal area, type of patch, time of operation, and frequency of swelling of perineum. Postoperative recovery was compared among the three groups at 24 hours and 1 month after surgery, including pain scores, foreign body sensation, local complications, urinary retention, swelling of the perineum, sex life and mobility. Results: Seventy-eight patients were included in the final analysis. There were no differences among the three groups in patients' age, gender, type of hernia, hernia defect size, dissection of inguinal area and type of patch. However, the time of operation of intervention group increased (p=0.015) and incidence of swelling of perineum decreased than other two groups (p&lt;0.05). After 24 hours, there were no significant differences in pain, foreign body sensation, local complications and urinary retention. Perineal swelling remission rate of intervention group was better than other two groups (p&lt;0.05). After one month, three groups had no differences in the all terms of pain, foreign body sensation, sexual life and perineal swelling residual rate.

However, existing ground stations cannot provide sufficient vertical observations of PM2.5, especially at fine scales regarding space and time. This study deployed a six-rotor unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with portable monitors to observe the vertical distributions of PM2.5 and meteorological parameters within 1000 m lower troposphere. By comparing with ground-based monitoring station and tethered balloon platform for PM2.5 measurements, the UAV was improved and then used to perform a field observation experiment in the Qingpu district of Shanghai, China. The UAV-based observations showed a decreasing vertical profile of PM2.5 in the experimental day, with a decrease of more than 50% at 0–1000 m height. PM2.5 had a vertical pattern that declined rapidly after 700 m in the afternoon, but the morning PM2.5 had a rapid decline from 200 to 500 m compared with other height intervals in this period. A temperature inversion at a lower height in the morning blocked newly formed PM2.5 at ground to disperse upward, and PM2.5 above the temperature inversion was composed of residuals in last night. The temperature inversion gradually climbed up in the afternoon, which was beneficial to the dispersion of near-ground PM2.5. The difference of relative humidity above and below 700 m height implies different geographical origins that were well identified and explained by a cluster analysis.

Lamprey play a vital role in river ecosystems and are one of the oldest vertebrates that have persisted over time likely influencing the evolution of many aquatic species. Pacific Lamprey have declined in abundance and are restricted in distribution throughout Washington, Oregon, Idaho and California. A key uncertainty influencing Pacific Lamprey status is the impact of climate change. We modified the NatureServe Climate Change Vulnerability Index (CCVI) to accommodate climate predictions from the International Panel on Climate Change. Using downscaled information, we characterized changes in 15 rivers occupied by Pacific Lamprey in the western U.S. We evaluated this risk under Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 for two time periods (mid-century 2040–2069 and end-century 2070–2099). The CCVI scores generally increased when going from RCP 4.5 to RCP 8.5 in three Global Climate Models for both mid-century and end-century, which our analyses forecasts degraded stream temperature and hydrologic conditions under increasing greenhouse gas emissions. The geographically assessed results suggest that climate change impacts to Pacific Lamprey vulnerability are magnified in highly altered rivers. If we continue to observe greenhouse gas emission levels associated with the RCP 8.5, Pacific Lamprey will be at greater risk to climate change impacts. In order to mitigate the risk from climate change toward the end of the century, additional actions will need to be prioritized to rapidly reduce the impact of these threats such as increasing flow, creating backwater habitat, restoring riparian vegetation and reducing stream disturbances. The findings revealed the patterns of vulnerability for Pacific Lamprey across their U.S. range are informative for prioritizing river restoration actions when paired with regional implementation plans. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The experimental results show that the introduction of TiN nanoparticles into dye-doped nematic liquid crystals significantly reduces the threshold of random lasing due to the localized surface plasmon resonance of TiN nanoparticles. The emission spectrum of random lasers can be controlled by the shape of the pump spot. The threshold of random lasers increases with the decrease of the length of pump stripe. In order to obtain the emission spectrum with fine discrete sharp peaks, the narrow pump stripe is more effective than the circular pump spot. When the pump area is more like a circle, the emission spectrum is more like an amplified spontaneous emission. The underlying mechanisms of these phenomena are discussed in detail.

There is widespread consensus that they both support and require transdisciplinary approaches, notably by involving citizens in the change process and finding innovative ways to unite different actors’ efforts and capacities. However, there is little empirical evidence regarding the actual value of citizen involvement to sustainability in this field. Against this background, this paper examines whether (or not) current forms and conditions of citizen involvement help to create a platform to support nature-based solutions and ensure a transformative adaptation process. The results show that under current conditions, citizen engagement often hampers sustainable outcomes. In fact, current structures and mechanisms for mainstreaming nature and climate considerations into sectoral planning are limited and, furthermore, neglect citizen involvement. In addition, there is a blind spot with respect to personal spheres of transformation toward sustainability regarding citizens, civil servants, and decision-makers. Key constraints are power structures and the lack of cognitive/emotional and relational capacities required for improved democratic governance. If we are to tap into the potential of nature-based solutions to increase climate adaptation governance, we need targeted financial and human resources, and greater capacity to overcome current constraints and support all levels and phases of mainstreaming, notably planning, implementation, monitoring, and learning. © 2019, The Author(s).","Citizen engagement; Citizen participation; Citizen science; Climate change adaptation; Co-Production; Collaborative governance; Disaster risk reduction; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem-based adaptation; Ecosystem-based planning; Emotions; Nature-based solutions; Public participation; Sustainability; Values","Decision making; Ecosystems; Sustainable development; Citizen engagements; Citizen participation; Citizen science; Climate change adaptation; Co-production; Collaborative governances; Disaster risk reductions; Ecosystem services; Emotions; Public participation; Values; Climate change; adaptive management; climate change; decision making; governance approach; local participation; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074755618

Coastal alluvial fans (CAF) show, in comparison to the interior fans of the Atacama Desert, pronounced recent activity. However, the complex interplay between climate, lithology, and tectonics affecting the CAF morphodynamics in such hyperarid coastal settings needs to be better understood. We therefore aim at assessing the major factors driving CAF activity and evaluate their effects along gradients. We conducted an extensive study relating climatic, lithologic, and tectonic characteristics to fan and catchment geomorphology of 123 CAF. Geomorphometric analyses are based on the 12.5 m TanDEM-X WorldDEM™, catchment lithology and faults are extracted from 13 regional geological maps, and the frequency of heavy rainfall events capable of activating CAF is derived from a Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model. Our results point to a primary climatic control on CAF morphodynamics shown in functional relationships with catchment hydromorphometric characteristics reflecting a high susceptibility to debris flows – the main CAF-constructing process. Catchment properties along the latitudinal gradient reflect the source of significant precipitation events: frontal systems and cut-off lows which mainly originate in the extratropics and become increasingly rare towards the north. The frequency of precipitation extremes can only be correlated to the hydromorphometry and geomorphic maturity of catchments that feature a high degree of sediment transport potential and generally do not cut back far into the Coastal Cordillera. Related to the strongly reduced influence of the Pacific precipitation source towards the east, this additional climatic transition is governed by the orographic effect of the steep W-E gradient in topography. In contrast, source-area lithology is of negligible relevance for CAF catchment morphometry and fan activity. An important indirect influence of tectonics, however, can be seen in the long-term (neo)tectonic activity within the Coastal Cordillera, which in turn shapes catchments and controls the topography. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Alluvial fan; Atacama Desert; Coast; Geomorphometry; TanDEM-X; WRF model","Catchments; Coastal zones; Landforms; Lithology; Precipitation (meteorology); Room and pillar mining; Runoff; Sediment transport; Tectonics; Topography; Weather forecasting; Alluvial fans; Atacama Desert; Geomorphometry; TanDEM-X; WRF Model; Climate models; alluvial fan; catchment; climate change; debris flow; geology; geomorphology; latitude; latitudinal gradient; lithology; morphodynamics; orographic effect; rainfall; regional climate; sediment transport; TanDEM-X; topography; Atacama Desert; Chile; Coastal Cordillera; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076509717

However all of the studies available in the literature were focused on an ideal and clean environment where trees are not under environmental stresses. Here, we studied the effects of ambient ozone on the leaf area index (LAI) of trees and the resultant reduction in the effectiveness of trees in providing MCC. The ENVI-met model, which was well validated against our bio-meteorological measurements, was used to quantify the effect of reduced LAI on the cooling performance of trees in two urban sites of Hong Kong. Under the influence of ambient ozone stress with a high sky view factor (SVF), the sensible heat fluxes and surface temperatures were calculated to be at least 40 Wm−2 and 5 °C higher than the stress-free case, respectively. For the low-SVF situation with the LAI value decreased by 25%, the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) values indicated that heat-related physiological stress increased by 1 grade in the planted areas. With the increasing surface-level ozone concentrations in the southern China region, the current study provides useful information for cities to refine design schemes and plan specifications for urban greenery to cope with the problem. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Micro-climate cooling; Ozone pollution; Thermal comfort; Urban greenery","Ozone; Physiology; Reforestation; Thermal comfort; Thermal pollution; Urban growth; Environmental stress; Meteorological measurements; Micro-climate; Ozone pollution; Physiological equivalent temperatures; Physiological stress; Surface temperatures; Urban greenery; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072206477

To this end, the present study attempted to predict the intention to adopt battery electric vehicles in Germany through a comprehensive integrated research framework based on the norm activation model and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology. Data from an online questionnaire of 349 consumers in Germany was collected to test the developed hypotheses using structural equitation modelling. The results suggested that the consumers’ expected performance, anticipated effort, facilitating conditions and personal norm significantly influence adoption intention. Hence, managerial implications suggest that a combination of awareness and education campaigns, and regulatory measures will lead to significant results by reaching the right consumers, achieving climate policy goals and mitigating greenhouse gas emission.

In this work, we report a surface active-site engineering approach for modulating electrocatalytic CO2 reduction using the macrocycle cucurbit[6]uril (CB[6]). A pristine gold surface functionalized with CB[6] nanocavities was studied as a hybrid organic-inorganic model system that utilizes host-guest chemistry to influence the heterogeneous electrocatalytic reaction. The combination of surface-enhanced infrared absorption (SEIRA) spectroscopy and electrocatalytic experiments in conjunction with theoretical calculations supports capture and reduction of CO2 inside the hydrophobic cavity of CB[6] on the gold surface in aqueous KHCO3 at negative potentials. SEIRA spectroscopic experiments show that the decoration of gold with the supramolecular host CB[6] leads to an increased local CO2 concentration close to the metal interface. Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction on a CB[6]-coated gold electrode indicates differences in the specific interactions between CO2 reduction intermediates within and outside the CB[6] molecular cavity, illustrated by a decrease in current density from CO generation, but almost invariant H2 production compared to unfunctionalized gold. The presented methodology and mechanistic insight can guide future design of molecularly engineered catalytic environments through interfacial host-guest chemistry.

Intensive cropping practices can lead to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In order to reduce these emissions, numerous studies have been made on lowering N inputs or applying nitrification inhibitors (NIs) which tend to maintain or even increase yield while reducing N leaching and nitrogenous emissions to the atmosphere. However, very few studies have been conducted on potential GHG emissions from the peach crop. In this work, a three-year study was carried out in a commercial peach orchard with a split-plot design with three replicates, in which the main factor was N dose (25, 50 and 100 kg N ha−1 year−1, and 50 kg N ha−1 year−1 applied during a shorter period of time in 2015 and 2016; and only 70 kg N ha−1 year−1 in 2017). Subplots in the study were used to analyse the effect of the application of a NI (3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate; DMPP). The aim was to qualitatively compare the effect of these factors on N2O, N2O + N2, CH4 and CO2 emissions from a peach orchard soil in order to recommend agricultural practices that minimise emissions without concurrent yield reductions. We show that N2O and N2O + N2 emissions were linked to fertilisation and increased with N dose. The N2O emissions were mitigated (up to 49%) by DMPP up to the 50 kg N ha−1 dose (not significantly). It seems that between 70 and 100 kg N ha−1 the application of DMPP loses effectiveness. Methane oxidation increased with N dose and decreased with DMPP application; CO2 emissions increased with DMPP and were unaffected by N dose. The intermediate N dose (50 kg N ha−1) applied during a shorter period of time increased yield (not significantly) and NUE without increasing GHG emissions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CH4 oxidation; CO2; DMPP; Fertigation; N2O; NUE","Carbon dioxide; Composting; Crops; Fruits; Gas emissions; Nitrification; Orchards; Agricultural practices; CH4 oxidation; DMPP; Economic importance; Fertigations; Methane oxidation; Nitrification inhibitor; Split plot designs; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrogen; nitrogen dioxide; fertilizer; nitrogen; agricultural emission; angiosperm; carbon dioxide; inhibitor; methane; nitrification; nitrogen dioxide; orchard; oxidation; agriculture; Article; concentration (parameter); controlled study; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; nitrification; orchard; oxidation; peach; priority journal; qualitative analysis; sampling; soil fertilization; crop; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; nitrification; Prunus persica; Agriculture; Crops, Agricultural; Environmental Monitoring; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Gases; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Prunus persica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074275919

At this time of the year, large numbers of the particles consist of ammonium sulfate and nitrate which are formed from ammonia (NH3) released during fertilizer spreading practices and transported from the surrounding areas to Paris. There is still limited knowledge of the emission sources around Paris, their magnitude, and their seasonality. Using space-borne NH3 observation records of 10 years (2008.2017) and 5 years (2013.2017) provided by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) and the Cross-Track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) instrument, regional patterns of NH3 variabilities (seasonal and interannual) are derived. Observations reveal identical high seasonal variability with three major NH3 hotspots found from March to August. The high interannual variability is discussed with respect to atmospheric total precipitation and temperature. A detailed analysis of the seasonal cycle is performed using both IASI and CrIS instrument data, together with outputs from the CHIMERE atmospheric model. For 2014 and 2015, the CHIMERE model shows coefficients of determination of 0.58 and 0.18 when compared to IASI and CrIS, respectively. With respect to spatial variability, the CHIMERE monthly NH3 concentrations in spring show a slight underrepresentation over Belgium and the United Kingdom and an overrepresentation in agricultural areas in the French Brittany.Pays de la Loire and Plateau du Jura region, as well as in northern Switzerland. In addition, PM2.5 concentrations derived from the CHIMERE model have been evaluated against surface measurements from the Airparif network over Paris, with which agreement was found (r2 = 0.56) with however an underestimation during spring pollution events. Using HYSPLIT cluster analysis of back trajectories, we show that NH3 total columns measured in spring over Paris are enhanced when air masses originate from the north-east (e.g. the Netherlands and Belgium), highlighting the importance of long-range transport in the NH3 budget over Paris. Variability in NH3 in the north-east region is likely to impact NH3 concentrations in the Parisian region since the crosscorrelation function is above 0.3 (at lag=0 and 1 d). Finally, we quantify the key meteorological parameters driving the specific conditions important for the formation of PM2.5 from NH3 in the Ile-de-France region in spring. Datadriven results based on surface PM2.5 measurements from the Airparif network and IASI NH3 measurements show that a combination of the factors such as a low boundary layer of ∼ 500 m, a relatively low temperature of 5 °C, a high relative humidity of 70 %, and wind from the north-east contributes to a positive PM2.5 and NH3 correlation. © 2020 Author(s).",,"ammonia; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); megacity; particulate matter; seasonal variation; source apportionment; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078237241

The measurements were performed from the roof of the historical building of the Ximenes Observatory. CO2 flux data revealed that the metropolitan area acted as a net source of CO2 during the whole observation period. According to the Keeling plot analysis, anthropogenic contributions to atmospheric CO2 were mainly represented by vehicular traffic (about 30%) and natural gas combustion (about 70%), the latter contributing 7 times more in December than in July. Moreover, the measured CO2 fluxes were about 80% higher in fall than in summer, confirming that domestic heating based on natural gas is the dominant CO2 emitting source in the municipality of Florence. Even though the continuous monitoring revealed a shift in the δ13C-CO2 values related to photosynthetic uptake of atmospheric CO2, the isotopic effect induced by plant activity was restricted to few hours in October and, to a lesser extent, in November. This suggests that urban planning policies should be devoted to massively increase green infrastructures in the metropolitan area in order to counterbalance anthropogenic emissions. During fall, the atmospheric CH4 concentrations were sensibly higher with respect to those recorded in summer, whilst the δ13C-CH4 values shifted towards heavier values.

The pavement design included a geogrid-stabilised aggregate base layer, a granular subbase layer and subgrade using target resilient modulus (M r) design values for each layer. Rutting ‘failure’ based at a specified number of equivalent single axle loads (ESALs) was adopted as the key performance indicator. The project specifications required verifying the design assumptions for the geogrid-stabilised base layer using in situ accelerated plate load testing. The testing involved repeated cyclic loading (1,000 cycles) tests with a multi-layered analysis sensor kit to determine the in situ M r of the three-layered composite pavement system as well as the geogrid-stabilised base layer. The permanent deformation of the pavement system was measured and modelled to predict the number of loading cycles required to reach the ‘failure’ criteria assumed in the design.

The city of Erbil is explored where in the rapid transformation and import of Western architectural styles and materials have resulted in ignorance of climate-responsive tradition existing in the city since thousands of years. Design/methodology/approach: In order to propose a design strategy for modern residential buildings in Erbil city, a descriptive and interpretative approach is used as a methodology of this study. A literature review is done to explore the traditional use of passive techniques, and Waziran district of the city is analyzed and used as a pilot site in this study. Findings: Due to the shortage of electric power in the city, residential buildings have limited access to electric power. Therefore, thermal comfort and reduction of the energy use in residential buildings have become vital for Erbil. The use of passive techniques in architectural design will help to reduce energy dependency. Research limitations/implications: This study is limited to residential function in Erbil. Waziran district is used for the design proposals where dwellings are in a row context. The proposals are made on a geometrical basis and plan organization; however, the selection of construction materials is not included. Originality/value: There is a proposal to reduce the use of electricity, which currently has limited access in Erbil city. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Climate response; Erbil city; Passive techniques; Semi-arid climate; Solar energy; Thermal comfort",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069510248

Among all nutrients in manure, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) cause the greatest environmental concern. Treatment technologies can play an important role in the management of animal manures by providing a more flexible approach to land application and acreage limitations. Development of technologies for nutrient-reuse was identified as one of the five main challenges in waste management within a circular economy. Manure treatment can be accomplished with the use of biological, chemical, and physical methodologies as part of treatment systems that are integrated with the needs of the land and create additional value through nutrient concentration and recycling, water quality credits, energy production, greenhouse gas reductions, and other beneficial by-products. This chapter reviews the alternative approaches for removing and recovering N and P from animal manure using both on-farm and off-farm management. Major components include diet manipulation, solid-liquid separation, and anaerobic digestion. The resulting materials are subsequently treated using a variety of technologies developed for solid or liquid fractions that include: composting, thermochemical processes, extraction of phosphate concentrates, recovery of the ammonia, biological nutrient removal processes, and vegetative or algal nutrient removal systems. Desirable properties of the recovered products and agronomic utilization are also discussed. © by American Society of Agronomy, Inc. Soil Science Society of America, Inc.

However, the considerable time required for implementation limits its use by grapegrowers. Efficient mechanization can potentially mitigate these issues, albeit this practice has not yet been compared to manual application at prebloom and after-bloom stages in a cool and humid growing region where cluster rot is the major limitation for yield and fruit quality. The goal of this study was to compare mechanical leaf removal (ME) with the manual (MA) removal of six leaves at the prebloom (PB) and after-bloom (AB) phenological stages over two seasons in Pinot Grigio (a tight-clustered cultivar). Fruit set was only decreased in 2017 by MA of six basal leaves at PB (PB-MA); however, PB reduced cluster compactness in each season. The loss of fruit to gray mold was lowered by all leaf removal treatments in the drier 2017 season, but only MA treatments mitigated loss from sour rot in that year. This indicates that a clear fruit zone and reduced cluster compactness are both needed to lower the effect of cluster rot disease. Only PB treatments enhanced fruit quality, likely driven by a similar reduction in cluster compactness. The results suggest that ME at PB may be used to decrease fruit loss to gray mold in dry seasons and enhance fruit Brix. Nevertheless, PB-MA can be an effective means to reduce fruit loss to sour rot in drier seasons and enhance ripening in years with high precipitation during veraison. This information provides a single approach to alleviate two prominent issues facing seasonal management strategies in cool climate viticulture. © 2020 by the American Society for Enology and Viticulture.

Uncertainty exists concerning what excluded the subtropical to tropical palm-dominated woodland/forest vegetation that was the dominant component in the CFR in the Paleocene and allowed the fynbos clades, which are largely derived from outside Africa, to establish and radiate. Two filters have been proposed. The first postulates that the establishment of the Mediterranean climate driven by the late Miocene initiation of the cold-water Benguela Upwelling System (BUS) eliminated the African lineages and allowed the establishment and radiation of sclerophyllous plant clades (“the Mediterranean climate model”, MCM). Alternatively, the “oligotrophic soils model” (OSM) postulates that the oligotrophic soils, gradually exhumed by post-Gondwanan Late Cretaceous – early Cenozoic erosion, acted as a filter excluding the African lineages. In this study, we re-calibrate the fynbos clade Phylica (Rhamnaceae), the genus initially used to test the MCM, using new fossil data to test if the crown age precedes the Late Miocene. Our results indicate that we cannot significantly reject a crown age of Phylica consistent with the MCM. We compare the MCM and OSM model for the Cape fynbos flora by compiling the crown ages of 22 fynbos clades. We show that crown ages are not clustered in time around the initiation of the BUS but, are dispersed throughout the Cenozoic. This suggests that oligotrophic soils, rather than summer drought, acted as a filter. Consequently, we argue that the fynbos clades radiated separately in expanding edaphically controlled heathland patches in the Cape mountains as sandstone exhumation after the Gondwanan break-up progressed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Benguela Upwelling System; Cape Flora; Fynbos; Oligotrophic soil; Phylica; Rhamnaceae","classification; climate; fossil; phylogeny; Rhamnaceae; soil; South Africa; Climate; Fossils; Phylogeny; Rhamnaceae; Soil; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074173433

With reduction in anticipated manufacturing and delivery timescales, logistics personnel are expected to identify the correct location (accurately) and supply the goods in appropriate condition (safe delivery). Moving towards more environmentally sustainable supply chains, the last/first mile of deliveries may be completed by a cyclist courier which could result in significant reductions in congestion and emissions in cities. In addition, the last metres of an increasing number of deliveries are completed on foot i.e. as a pedestrian. Although research into new technologies to support enhanced navigation capabilities is ongoing, the focus to date has been on technical implementations with limited studies addressing how information is perceived and actioned by a human courier. In the research reported in this paper a comparison study has been conducted with 24 participants evaluating two examples of state-of-the-art navigation aids to support accurate (right time and place) and safe (right condition) navigation. Participants completed 4 navigation tasks, 2 whilst cycling and 2 whilst walking. The navigation devices under investigation were a handheld display presenting a map and instructions and an in-sight monocular display presenting text and arrow instructions. Navigation was conducted in a real-world environment in which eye movements and device interaction were recorded using Tobii-Pro 2 eye tracking glasses. The results indicate that the handheld device provided better support for accurate navigation (right time and place), with longer but less frequent gaze interactions and higher perceived usability.

However, the potential existence of tipping points in socio-economic systems has remained underexplored, whereas they might be highly policy relevant. This paper describes characteristics of climate change induced socio-economic tipping points (SETPs) to guide future research on SETPS to inform climate policy. We review existing literature to create a tipping point typology and to derive the following SETP definition: a climate change induced, abrupt change of a socio-economic system, into a new, fundamentally different state. Through stakeholder consultation, we identify 22 candidate SETP examples with policy relevance for Europe. Three of these are described in higher detail to identify their tipping point characteristics (stable states, mechanisms and abrupt change): the collapse of winter sports tourism, farmland abandonment and sea-level rise-induced migration. We find that stakeholder perceptions play an important role in describing SETPs. The role of climate drivers is difficult to isolate from other drivers because of complex interplays with socio-economic factors. In some cases, the rate of change rather than the magnitude of change causes a tipping point. The clearest SETPs are found on small system scales. On a national to continental scale, SETPs are less obvious because they are difficult to separate from their associated economic substitution effects and policy response. Some proposed adaptation measures are so transformative that their implementations can be considered an SETP in terms of 'response to climate change'. Future research can focus on identification and impact analysis of tipping points using stylized models, on the exceedance of stakeholder-defined critical thresholds in the RCP/SSP space and on the macro-economic impacts of new system states. © 2020 The Author(s).

However, little is known about how local governments can capitalize on what has been learned and use it to accelerate scaling-up processes. This paper explores the complex relationship between LCIs and learning processes at the level of local government. The issue is examined through an explorative embedded case study in the City of Copenhagen, a sustainability frontrunner. The paper makes three contributions that enrich literature and practice concerning climate governance for sustainability transitions. First, it offers an overview of two types of knowledge that can be derived from LCIs to accelerate scaling-up processes: instrumental and transformative knowledge. Second, the paper provides a concrete overview of learning practices for governing learning processes within local government. Local governments can learn from LCIs through four categories of practice: experience accumulation, knowledge articulation, knowledge codification, and knowledge distribution. Finally, the paper offers an overview of explanatory factors related to the motivation, resources, and skills that influence a local government's capacity to learn from LCIs. The findings particularly highlight the importance of setting a mandate for experimenting with and evaluating LCIs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Experimentation; Initiatives; Learning; Local government; Low-carbon; Scaling-up","Sustainable development; Experimentation; Initiatives; Learning; Local government; Low carbon; Scaling-up; Carbon; carbon emission; emissions trading; experimental study; learning; local government; Copenhagen [(CTY) Hovedstaden]; Denmark; Hovedstaden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074725566

Following the rapid and widespread emergence of these programs, scholars have been active in mapping, exploring, and interrogating their design and performance. Considerable advances have been made in describing program design and context conditions, and the actors involved in the voluntary program that relate to program performance. Less is known, however, about how these conditions affect program performance. Starting with one of the dominant theories on voluntary programs, the club theory perspective, this article seeks to understand how different program design conditions interact to affect the performance of 26 voluntary programs for low carbon building and city development in Australia, the Netherlands, and the United States. Applying qualitative comparative analysis, the study finds that the club theory perspective has limited explanatory power for this specific set of cases. Iterative rounds of analysis indicate that a diffusion network perspective is the best complementary perspective for explaining the performance of this set of programs. The article concludes that, in situations of a non-homogeneous market of voluntary program participants, a focus on the programs’ diffusion networks helps to explain their performance. This has implications for the design and implementation of such programs. © 2018 The Authors.

To determine whether ethical climate is associated with the intention to leave after adjustment for country, ICU and clinicians characteristics. Methods: Perceptions of the ethical climate among clinicians working in 68 adult ICUs in 12 European countries and the US were measured using a self-assessment questionnaire, together with job characteristics and intent to leave as a sub-analysis of the Dispropricus study. The validated ethical decision-making climate questionnaire included seven factors: not avoiding decision-making at end-of-life (EOL), mutual respect within the interdisciplinary team, open interdisciplinary reflection, ethical awareness, self-reflective physician leadership, active decision-making at end-of-life by physicians, and involvement of nurses in EOL. Hierarchical mixed effect models were used to assess associations between these factors, and the intent to leave in clinicians within ICUs, within the different countries. Results: Of 3610 nurses and 1137 physicians providing ICU bedside care, 63.1% and 62.9% participated, respectively. Of 2992 participating clinicians, 782 (26.1%) had intent to leave, of which 27% nurses, 24% junior and 22.7% senior physicians. After adjustment for country, ICU and clinicians characteristics, mutual respect OR 0.77 (95% CI 0.66- 0.90), open interdisciplinary reflection (OR 0.73 [95% CI 0.62–0.86]) and not avoiding EOL decisions (OR 0.87 [95% CI 0.77–0.98]) were all associated with a lower intent to leave. Conclusion: This is the first large multicenter study showing an independent association between clinicians’ intent to leave and the quality of the ethical climate in the ICU. Interventions to reduce intent to leave may be most effective when they focus on improving mutual respect, interdisciplinary reflection and active decision-making at EOL. © 2019, The Author(s).","Decision-making; Ethical climate; Intent to leave; Interdisciplinary reflection; Respect","adult; article; awareness; climate; controlled study; ethical decision making; Europe; female; human; human experiment; intensive care unit; job characteristics; leadership; male; multicenter study; nurse; observational study; perception; physician; questionnaire; respect; self evaluation; United States; behavior; ethics; Europe; health care personnel; health personnel attitude; intensive care; intensive care unit; medical ethics; organization and management; organizational culture; psychology; United States; Adult; Attitude of Health Personnel; Critical Care; Ethics, Medical; Europe; Female; Health Personnel; Humans; Intensive Care Units; Intention; Male; Organizational Culture; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074840129

Maize is Mexico's staple food crop, thus, decrements in national production would strongly compromise food security in the country. Internationally, maize is the most important grain crop in terms of human consumption and the conservation in situ of its germplasm should be a global priority. Mexico harbors half of the known genetic diversity for this crop in the American continent, which is instrumental for future genetic improvement efforts that could generate new, environmentally resilient varieties. In this study, we analyze the link between maize yield and several climate variables in rainfed and irrigated crop areas in Mexico to project yield variations under future climate change scenarios. We used municipality-level data for seven states that account for ∼65% of the annual maize production in Mexico and cover an important amount of national climatic variability. We used public data published by the Mexican government on yield and climate from 2003 to 2015 and built linear models to assess the impact of climate on maize yield. We considered the municipality to be a random effect and accounted for potential autocorrelation in the 13-year time series. We also evaluated how many municipalities reached their states' breakeven point in order to project the geographic areas that will earn higher profits due to increased yields. Our results showed that the municipality had a significant effect on yield, and consequently, our results could not be extrapolated to other geographic areas in the country. We found temperature to be the most influential factor on yield under rainfed conditions, while precipitation was the most influential factor for irrigated crops. Like earlier studies at a global scale, we found higher yield stability for irrigated fields than for rainfed fields when considering different climate change scenarios. Our projections indicate that yields from rainfed fields will be reduced significantly under future scenarios. We argue that average yield data in rainfed fields does not include data on the diversity of native maize varieties or their potentially different responses to changes in the environment. Finally, under current conditions, there are by far more municipalities reaching their breakeven point in rainfed fields than in irrigated fields, suggesting that higher yields do not necessarily translate into greater profits for farmers because costs can also increase depending on the type of agriculture practiced. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Crop yields; Irrigation; Maize; Rainfed","agrometeorology; autocorrelation; climate change; crop improvement; crop yield; food security; germplasm; irrigation system; maize; rainfed agriculture; selective breeding; Mexico [North America]; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073204004

To this purpose, Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) and elemental analyses were carried out and the PM collected on the filters was examined via scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The study also investigated the overall morphology of soot particles from the blend of 75% waste cooking oil (WCO) + 25% diesel (B75) in a diesel engine at three different loads (75%, 50% and 10%) compared with the morphology of the soot particles from diesel fuel (B0). The FTIR spectra of the B75 fuel exhibited the characteristic regions of oxygen bonds. Compared to the B0 fuel, the increased oxidation from the excess oxygen in the B75 fuel reduced the size and number of soot particles. It was also verified that the degree of unsaturation was related to the oxygen content of the B75 fuel. The FTIR spectra of the B75 fuel showed a C = O tensile band methyl ester in 1734 cm−1 and C–O bands at 1214–1362 cm−1.

Seedlings originating from contrasting climates differentially express functional traits related to water and nutrient uptake and drought resistance that reflect their climate of origin and influence their responses to drought. Soil microbes may improve seedling establishment because they can enhance water and nutrient uptake and drought resistance. However, the relative influence of soil microbes on the expression of these functional traits between seedling families or populations from contrasting climates is unknown. To determine if soil microbes may differentially alter functional traits to enhance water and nutrient uptake and drought resistance between dry and wet families, seeds of loblolly pine families from the driest and wettest ends of its geographic range (dry, wet) were planted in sterilized sand (controls) or in sterilized sand inoculated with a soil microbial community (inoculated). Functional traits related to seedling establishment (germination), water and nutrient uptake and C allocation (root:shoot biomass ratio, root exudate concentration, leaf C:N, leaf N isotope composition (δ15N)), and drought resistance (turgor loss point, leaf carbon isotope composition (δ13C)) were measured. Then, plants were exposed to a drought treatment and possible shifts in photosynthetic performance were monitored using chlorophyll fluorescence. Inoculated plants exhibited significantly greater germination than controls regardless of family. The inoculation treatment significantly increased root:shoot biomass ratio in the wet family but not in the dry family, suggesting soil microbes alter functional traits that improve water and nutrient uptake more so in a family originating from a wetter climate than in a family originating from a drier climate. Microbial effects on photosynthetic performance during drought also differed between families, as photosynthetic performance of the dry inoculated group declined fastest. Regardless of treatment, the dry family exhibited a greater root:shoot biomass ratio, root exudate concentration, and leaf δ15N than the wet family. This indicates that the dry family allocated more resources belowground than the wet and the two family may have used different sources of plant available N, which may be related to their contrasting climates of origin and influence their drought resistance. Examination of variation in impacts of soil microbes on seedling physiology improves efforts to enhance seedling establishment and beneficial plant-microbe interactions under climate change. © Copyright © 2020 Ulrich, Sevanto, Peterson, Ryan and Dunbar.","drought; genetic variation; growth; loblolly pine; root exudates; seedling physiology; soil microbes; turgor loss point",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078409927

Pakistan is facing acute water scarcity and regionalization of drought is a pre-planning strategy for coping the severe condition of water management in the country. This study is conducted to identify homogenous climatic regions (HCRs) with respect to drought condition based on Reconnaissance Drought Index using climate data of 55 metrological stations across Pakistan. For this purpose two statistical methods, cluster analysis and L-moments technique were used. First, cluster analysis was performed using site characteristics of the stations which identified five homogenous groups. Second, two statistical measures that is, discordancy measures and heterogeneity measure were implied after some regional adjustments, to satisfy the homogeneity of the homogenous groups developed in step one based on at-site statistics of the stations using L-moments technique. These statistical measures established validity of five homogeneous climatic regions for Pakistan. Third, to assess these HCRs several results using site characteristics and climate data of the stations were calculated which show that elevation has key role in the rainfall pattern and aridity of the regions. According to the results, there is high variability among these regions with respect to water recourses. First two regions consists most elevated areas with enough rainfall and glacier. Regions (3) and (4) include most vulnerable and drought-prone areas of Sindh and Baluchistan provinces while Region (5) has enough rainfall in monsoon season. This study findings will help in adaptation, mitigation and future's planning regarding climate, water resources management, monitoring droughts and its projections etc. in different areas and fill the gaps in existing literature in Pakistan. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","cluster analysis; droughts; homogenous climatic zones; L-moment; Reconnaissance Drought Index (RDI)","Climate change; Cluster analysis; Rain; Water management; Climatic zone; Drought conditions; L-moments; Reconnaissance drought indices; Regionalization of droughts; Site characteristics; Statistical measures; Water resources management; Drought; cluster analysis; drought; homogeneity; precipitation intensity; sustainable development; vulnerability; water management; water resource; Pakistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069913235

Since the majority of patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, development of a detection method for PDAC at an earlier stage of disease progression is strongly desirable. Integrin αVβ6 is a promising target for early PDAC detection because its expression increases during precancerous changes. The present study aimed to develop an imaging probe for positron emission tomography (PET) which targets αVβ6 integrin-positive PDAC. We selected A20FMDV2 peptide, which binds specifically to αvβ6 integrin, as a probe scaffold, and 68Ga as a radioisotope. A20FMDV2 peptide has not been previously labeled with 68Ga. A cysteine residue was introduced to the N-terminus of the probe at a site-specific conjugation of maleimide-NOTA (mal-NOTA) chelate. Different numbers of glycine residues were also introduced between cysteine and the A20FMDV2 sequence as a spacer in order to reduce the steric hindrance of the mal-NOTA on the binding probe to αVβ6 integrin. In vitro, the competitive binding assay revealed that probes containing a 6-glycine linker ([natGa]CG6 and [natGa]Ac-CG6) showed high affinity to αVβ6 integrin. Both probes could be labeled by 67/68Ga with high radiochemical yield (&gt;50%) and purity (&gt;98%). On biodistribution analysis, [67Ga]Ac-CG6 showed higher tumor accumulation, faster blood clearance, and lower accumulation in the surrounding organs of pancreas than did [67Ga]CG6. The αVβ6 integrin-positive xenografts were clearly visualized by PET imaging with [68Ga]Ac-CG6. The intratumoral distribution of [68Ga]Ac-CG6 coincided with the αVβ6 integrin-positive regions detected by immunohistochemistry. Thus, [68Ga]Ac-CG6 is a useful peptide probe for the imaging of αVβ6 integrin in PDAC. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","A20FMDV2 peptide; Gallium-68; Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma; Positron emission tomography; αvβ6 integrin","acetylcysteine(maleimide 1,4,7 triazacyclononane 1,4,7 triacetic acid)[6 glycine]A20FMDV2 amide ga 68; alphaVbeta6 integrin; cysteine; cysteine(maleimide 1,4,7 triazacyclononane 1,4,7 triacetic acid)[6 glycine]A20FMDV2 amide ga 68; glycine; tracer; unclassified drug; alphaVbeta6 integrin; gallium; integrin; peptide; tumor antigen; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; binding affinity; controlled study; drug accumulation; drug clearance; drug design; drug distribution; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; in vitro study; in vivo study; isotope labeling; male; mouse; nonhuman; pancreas adenocarcinoma; positron emission tomography; positron emission tomography-computed tomography; radiochemistry; stereospecificity; tumor xenograft; animal; chemical structure; chemistry; diagnostic imaging; dose response; drug development; experimental neoplasm; Institute for Cancer Research mouse; molecular probe; pancreas carcinoma; pancreas tumor; structure activity relation; synthesis; tumor cell culture; Animals; Antigens, Neoplasm; Carcinoma, Pancreatic Ductal; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Drug Development; Gallium Radioisotopes; Humans; Integrins; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred ICR; Molecular Probes; Molecular Structure; Neoplasms, Experimental; Pancreatic Neoplasms; Peptides; Positron-Emission Tomography; Structure-Activity Relationship; Tumor Cells, Cultured",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075354279

Presuppression and suppression costs are increasing but program budgets are not. Climate change impacts and increasing interface values-at-risk are challenging suppression effectiveness and resulting in more wildfire disasters. We conducted semi-structured interviews with these agencies to understand the strategies, policies, and preparedness procedures they currently use to manage wildfires. We summarize the results of this national agency assessment, and based on what we heard and our review of agency internal documents, discuss agency challenges and opportunities to be better prepared for a future with more wildfire. A double wildfire paradox exists requiring communities and critical values in wildfire-dependent ecosystems to be FireSmart, and wildfire management agencies to allow more wildfire on the landscape by implementing a risk-based appropriate response approach. We conclude with a proposed future path for wildfire management in Canada. To co-exist with wildfire, agencies in Canada must also strengthen and adjust their wildfire management capacity and capability. This necessitates stronger horizontal collaboration, enhanced resource sharing, investments to develop innovative decision support tools, and an increased focus on prevention and mitigation. © 2019 The Author(s)","Disasters; Emergency management; Preparedness; Presuppression; Suppression; Wildfire management","assessment method; climate change; climate effect; cost analysis; decision support system; disaster management; literature review; policy implementation; questionnaire survey; strategic approach; wildlife management; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076253228

Willingness to pay was tested empirically using survey data from 333 inhabitants of Sciacca, a fishing community in Sicily, Italy, which has the island's second largest fishing fleet. People's attitudes towards climate change, their degree of involvement in the issue, and their concerns about this phenomenon's potential impact on the marine environment are the key factors affecting their willingness to pay. It was further found that respondents are willing to pay an average of €6.81 per month to support mitigation policies in the fishing industry. The originality of this study is related to its contribution in expanding the body of knowledge on citizens’ willingness to pay for the protection of fish resources, using a conceptual framework based on the Construal Level Theory and the Theory of Reasoned Action to explain inhabitants’ behaviour.

Recent media effects research indicates that presentation of agreement or conflict between actors’ opinions influences how audiences respond to news about climate change and policy. While some national case studies have investigated portrayals of actors’ positions on important questions regarding climate change in the media, they are largely absent from comparative research. This study addresses this gap by analysing portrayals of actor-issue-positions and the emerging patterns of controversy and consensus in German, Canadian, and US coverage. Studying a sample of occurrences of climate change-related issues (N = 902) in-depth, the results show German media present political consensus about the need to limit emissions and societal controversy about the efficacy of specific mitigation measures. Presenting mainly consensus, Canadian media report more on climate change's impact, leaving aside the issue of efficacy. In the US, media emphasise political controversy — about the need to limit emissions and occasionally about climate change's impact on humans. The findings, consistent with other recent publications, can best be explained by journalists selectively indexing of seemingly relevant actor-issue-positions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Canada; Climate change; Consensus; Controversy; Germany; Online news coverage; US","climate change; comparative study; environmental policy; media role; political development; political discourse; Canada; Germany; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075745870

Lower Respiratory Infections Collaborators","Background: Despite large reductions in under-5 lower respiratory infection (LRI) mortality in many locations, the pace of progress for LRIs has generally lagged behind that of other childhood infectious diseases. To better inform programmes and policies focused on preventing and treating LRIs, we assessed the contributions and patterns of risk factor attribution, intervention coverage, and sociodemographic development in 195 countries and territories by drawing from the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2017 (GBD 2017) LRI estimates. Methods: We used four strategies to model LRI burden: the mortality due to LRIs was modelled using vital registration data, demographic surveillance data, and verbal autopsy data in a predictive ensemble modelling tool; the incidence of LRIs was modelled using population representative surveys, health-care utilisation data, and scientific literature in a compartmental meta-regression tool; the attribution of risk factors for LRI mortality was modelled in a counterfactual framework; and trends in LRI mortality were analysed applying changes in exposure to risk factors over time. In GBD, infectious disease mortality, including that due to LRI, is among HIV-negative individuals. We categorised locations based on their burden in 1990 to make comparisons in the changing burden between 1990 and 2017 and evaluate the relative percent change in mortality rate, incidence, and risk factor exposure to explain differences in the health loss associated with LRIs among children younger than 5 years. Findings: In 2017, LRIs caused 808 920 deaths (95% uncertainty interval 747 286–873 591) in children younger than 5 years. Since 1990, there has been a substantial decrease in the number of deaths (from 2 337 538 to 808 920 deaths; 65·4% decrease, 61·5–68·5) and in mortality rate (from 362·7 deaths [330·1–392·0] per 100 000 children to 118·9 deaths [109·8–128·3] per 100 000 children; 67·2% decrease, 63·5–70·1). LRI incidence declined globally (32·4% decrease, 27·2–37·5). The percent change in under-5 mortality rate and incidence has varied across locations. Among the risk factors assessed in this study, those responsible for the greatest decrease in under-5 LRI mortality between 1990 and 2017 were increased coverage of vaccination against Haemophilus influenza type b (11·4% decrease, 0·0–24·5), increased pneumococcal vaccine coverage (6·3% decrease, 6·1–6·3), and reductions in household air pollution (8·4%, 6·8–9·2). Interpretation: Our findings show that there have been substantial but uneven declines in LRI mortality among countries between 1990 and 2017. Although improvements in indicators of sociodemographic development could explain some of these trends, changes in exposure to modifiable risk factors are related to the rates of decline in LRI mortality. No single intervention would universally accelerate reductions in health loss associated with LRIs in all settings, but emphasising the most dominant risk factors, particularly in countries with high case fatality, can contribute to the reduction of preventable deaths.

This includes both routine and severe weather events. For example, with precipitation events, local topography and weather influence water runoff and infiltration, which directly affect flooding as well as drinking water quality and availability. The impact of such events creates issues of public safety. Thus, the availability of highly localized weather model predictions focused on public safety and operations of infrastructure can mitigate the impact of severe weather. This is especially true if the lead time for the availability of such predictions enables proactive allocation and deployment of resources to minimize recovery time from severe events. Typically, information at such a scale is simply not available. Hence, the ability of municipalities to proactively respond to these events is limited. Available continental- or regional-scale weather models are not appropriately matched to the temporal or spatial scale of such operations. While near-real-time assessment of observations of current weather conditions may have the appropriate geographic locality, by its very nature it is only directly suitable for reactive response. To address this gap, we use state-of-the-art physical weather models at the spatial scale of the city's infrastructure to avoid this mismatch in predictability. Model results are coupled to data-driven stochastic models to represent the actionable prediction of weather (business) impacts. In some cases, an intermediate physical model may be required to translate predicted weather into the phenomena that lead to such impacts. We have applied these ideas to several cities with a diversity of impacts and weather concerns and show how this coupled model methodology enables prediction of storm impacts on local infrastructure. We also discuss how this concept can be extended to a climate scale in order to evaluate the potential localized impacts of a warming planet and the effectiveness of strategies being used to mitigate such impacts. © 1957-2012 IBM.",,"Meteorology; Potable water; Stochastic systems; Topography; Water distribution systems; Water quality; Weather forecasting; Coupled modeling; Local topography; Local weather conditions; Precipitation events; Severe weather events; State of the art; Urban infrastructure; Weather modeling; Stochastic models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081578872

By focusing on the politics of implementation, this approach complements dominant approaches for assessing effectiveness that emphasize greenhouse gas emission accounting. Drawing on case studies of urban building low carbon governance in Stockholm, London and San Francisco incorporating 40 expert interviews, the analysis provides insight into whether climate change mitigation measures are catalyzing political momentum that is untangling fossil fuels from institutions. It finds that urban decarbonization is gaining political momentum when it comes to new buildings, although with concerning implications for inequality and uneven development, but systemic change is limited since efforts to target existing buildings are stumbling over challenges. Two key insights are highlighted: 1) reframing the policy goal of urban climate mitigation to decarbonization productively refocuses attention on systemic change; 2) effective urban carbon governance is not only about providing instrumental tools, but it also involves triggering political dynamics that build momentum. Future urban decarbonization initiatives should consider the complementary roles of offering instrumental solutions and catalyzing political momentum through implementation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Decarbonization; Governance; Mitigation; Politics; Urban","Carbon; Decarbonization; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Momentum; Climate change mitigation; Governance; Instrumental tools; Mitigation; Political dynamics; Politics; Urban; Urban buildings; Climate change; building; climate change; environmental politics; fossil fuel; governance approach; urban area; California; England; London [England]; San Francisco [California]; Stockholm [Stockholm (CNT)]; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074153580

For the specific case of the delivery sector, drones can alleviate road space usage and also lead to reductions in CO2 and air pollution emissions, compared to traditional diesel-powered vehicles. However, due to their unconventional acoustic characteristics and operational manoeuvres, it is uncertain how communities will respond to drone operations. Noise has been suggested as a major barrier to public acceptance of drone operations in urban areas. In this paper, a series of audio-visual scenarios were created to investigate the effects of drone noise on the reported loudness, annoyance and pleasantness of seven different types of urban soundscapes. In soundscapes highly impacted by road traffic noise, the presence of drone noise lead to small changes in the perceived loudness, annoyance and pleasantness. In soundscapes with reduced road traffic noise, the participants reported a significantly higher perceived loudness and annoyance and a lower pleasantness with the presence of the same drone noise. For instance, the reported annoyance increased from 2.3 ± 0.8 (without drone noise) to 6.8 ± 0.3 (with drone noise), in an 11-point scale (0-not at all, 10-extremely). Based on these results, the concentration of drone operations along flight paths through busy roads might aid in the mitigation of the overall community noise impact caused by drones. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Audio-visual effects; Drone noise; Listening experiments; Road traffic noise; Urban soundscape","Air pollution; Antennas; Audio acoustics; Drones; Noise pollution; Roads and streets; Acoustic characteristic; Audio-visual effects; Community noise impacts; Diesel-powered vehicles; Governmental agency; Pollution emissions; Road traffic noise; Urban soundscape; Acoustic noise; acoustics; noise; perception; road traffic; unmanned vehicle; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076713791

In this context, the construction of a new energy structure and the motivation of the consumer towards a change in their consumption behaviours to balance demand with a volatile energy supply are important issues. At the same time, Consumer Stock Ownership Plans (CSOPs) in renewable energies sources (RESs) have proven to be an essential cornerstone in the overall success of energy transition. Indeed, when consumers acquire ownership in RES, they become prosumers, participating in the phase of production and distribution of energy. Prosumers provide benefits by (1) generating a part of the energy they consume, (2) reducing their overall expenditure for energy, and (3) receiving a second source of income from the sale of excess production. Supporting Consumer Co-Ownership in Renewable Energies (SCORE) is an ongoing Horizon 2020 project with the aim of overcoming the usage of energy from fossil sources in favour of RES, promoting the creation of energy communities (EC) and facilitating co-ownership of renewable energies (RE) for consumers. SCORE hereby particularly emphasises the inclusion of women, low-income households, and vulnerable groups affected by fuel poverty that are as a rule excluded from RE investments. In this framework, the main goal of the present study is to illustrate the general procedure and process of EC creation. In particular, this paper focuses on the description of the methodological approach in implementing the CSOP model which consists of three main phases: the identification and description of selected buildings (preparation phase), the preliminary and feasibility analysis phase, and finally the phase of target group involvement. SCORE first started in three pilot regions in Italy, Czech Republic, and Poland, and later, with the aim of extending the methodology, in various other cities across Europe. In this study, Italian pilot study sites were chosen as a case study to develop and test the methodology. © 2020 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Here, we tested short-term responses of dryland plant communities to contrasting rainfall regimes using reciprocal transplants of soil and seed banks. We exposed three annual plant communities to very different climatic conditions along a steep rainfall gradient. We tested for the role of climate versus community origin on community response and resistance. In parallel, we asked whether origin-specific climatic adaptations predict compositional shifts across climates. Due to an extreme drought, all plants in the driest climate failed to reach maturity. For the remaining two community origins, the most dry-adapted species in each community increased in dry climate and the wet-adapted species increased in wet climate. Dry community origins showed large compositional shifts while maintaining stable plant density, biomass and species richness across climates. Conversely, wet communities showed smaller compositional shifts, but larger variation in biomass and richness. This asynchrony in species abundances in response to rainfall variability could maintain structural community stability. This, in combination with seed dormancy, has the ability to delay extinction in response to climate change. However, increasing occurrence of extreme droughts may, in the long-term, lead to loss of wet-adapted species. © 2019 Nordic Society Oikos","annual plant communities; climate change; climatic niche groups; community ecology; determinants of plant community; reciprocal transplants","adaptation; annual plant; assembly rule; climate change; community ecology; community response; community structure; Mediterranean environment; niche; plant community; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; seed bank; transplantation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073996063

Literature on this topic tends to focus on the instrumental drivers for businesses, leaving the ethical issues aside. We seek to compensate for this lacuna by suggesting a spectrum of approaches that business corporations adopt in response to climate change, making the ethical orientations explicit. The critical issue of the climate agenda is whether business communities can sufficiently contribute to absolute targets for climate mitigation. In order to avoid charges of greenwashing, business corporations need to be engaged with absolute targets, such as the 1.5 °C target of the Paris Agreement. Moreover, they need to be politically engaged as corporate citizens in order to mitigate climate change in partnership with state and civil society organisations. To provide a test of the proposed mapping tool, we present a case study based on interviews and a survey of sustainability reports (2007–2017) conducted at three Danish energy firms. We conclude that the case study confirms a wide range of corporate responses to climate change, spanning instrumental approaches like the natural-resource-based view, to also include more normative aspirational approaches such as corporate citizenship and political CSR. Furthermore, the mapping tool suggests also including green conservatism and systemic-critical views. Finally, the article discusses how sustainability managers handle the ethical dilemmas of responding to climate change, as well as the limits of the research design, and future prospects and issues raised by the study. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate ethics; Corporate citizenship; Corporate environmentalism; Political CSR",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074538435

The potential-dependent molecular behaviors were investigated by using a quadrupole mass spectrometer (Q-mass) where the molecules are collected through a gas-sampling tip located in near the electrode surface. For the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) on the polycrystalline Pt electrode, the potential-dependent Q-mass ion signal intensities of O2 (m/z = 32) that are ascribable to the dissolved oxygen molecules increased linearly with the disk electrode rotation rates without substantial interference from the collection tip, clearly showing that the dissolved O2 for ORR can be monitored by the RDE-OLEMS. For electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction (ECR) on the polycrystalline Au electrode, the potential-dependent Q-mass ion signal intensities of CO (m/z = 28) generated by the ECR increased with increasing disk rotation rates from 0 (without disk rotation) to 300 rpm in the potential region from-0.4 to-1.4 V vs.The reversible hydrogen electrode.

The aim of this study is to assess the impact of the Zakamensk W–Mo deposit development on soil surface horizons and the health of the local population. The results of the geochemical survey of 2012 revealed the spatial distribution patterns and abundances of 15 PTEs. The elements bulk contents were determined by ICP-MS and ICP-AES. The impact of geochemical situation on the health of the population of Zakamensk was also assessed using the mortality rates from diseases of the digestive and respiratory organs, neoplasms, including malignant tumors of the digestive and respiratory organs in 2008–2012. The tailing dumps have increased concentrations of W, Cd, Pb, Sb, Mo, Cu, Zn, Sn, As, and Co due to petrochemical characteristics of the ore. The soils of the industrial zone accumulate W, Cd, Mo, Pb, Sb, Zn, Cu, and Sn due to the waste storage sites deterioration and the thermal power plant and the foundry emissions. The multi-story residential zone soils accumulate W, Cd, Pb, Zn, and Mo. Tungsten, Pb, Sb, Co, V, and Cr cause the greatest harm to adults and children and together account for 92–96% of the hazard index.

The diversity of the vegetable crop community in the system was increased, human wastes were involved in mass exchange processes, and human respiration was periodically connected to the system. The system has been designed to test different prospective technologies for future closed life support systems intended for prolonged autonomous operation in space and terrestrial applications. Three methods of plant cultivation in the conveyer mode have been used: hydroponics on expanded clay aggregate, growing plants on the soil-like substrate, and plant cultivation in aquaculture. The technology of more effective oxidation of organic wastes in a physicochemical processing reactor has been developed. A human exhaled the air into the system and consumed the air from the system. O2 concentration did not drop below 20.8% and did not rise above 22.6%. CO2 concentration varied between 800 ppm and 2500 ppm. Plants growing under this CO2 range at a preset light irradiance showed optimal photosynthetic activity. The closure coefficients for Ca, Mg, S, N, K and P were above 90%. However, compared with the inflow, only 55% Ca, about 80% Mg, and 75% Na and P were removed from the system.

This paper used the Heckman selection model to empirically analyze the factors influencing policy innovations. The results show that under circumstances with weak incentives and weak constraints, the behaviors of local leaders in low-carbon pilot cities had a positive impact on policy innovations. Specifically, the local leader at the very top of the hierarchy responsible for the pilot leadership group had a significant impact on policy innovations. Departmental-level cadres who participated exchange seminars, which refer to conducting low-carbon tests, had positive impacts on policy innovations. Nevertheless, if the local government implemented a low-carbon related strategic plan, this also had a positive effect. With the increase in carbon emissions intensity, local leaders faced pressures to reduce carbon emissions, so that the effect of the leaders’ behaviors in promoting policy innovation was greater as well. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Leaders’ behavior; Local government; Low-carbon city pilots; Policy innovation","Carbon; Environmental management; Carbon emissions; Local government; Low carbon transformations; Low-carbon cities; Pilot programs; Selection model; Strategic plan; Three dimensions; Public policy; carbon emission; emission control; innovation; leadership; local government; air pollution; air pollution control; Article; behavior; city; environmental impact; government; health promotion; human; leadership; low carbon city; public policy; statistical model; strategic planning; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073520421

Giant panda (Ailuropoda melanoleuca), which is endemic to China and a global conservation icon, has the largest density in the Qinling Mountains. This paper investigated the spatiotemporal variation of heavy metal concentrations in soil (N = 44) at the regional scale with three zones of urban areas, mountain edges, and central mountains, the temporal variation of heavy metal concentrations in three bamboo species (N = 19) and two types of feces (N = 10), and assessed the ecological risk and health risk for giant pandas and their habitat in the Qinling Mountains. The results showed that the median concentrations of studied eight heavy metals mercury (Hg), arsenic (As), copper (Cu), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), chromium (Cr), lead (Pb), and cadmium (Cd) in soil exceeded the background values of Shaanxi Province except Pb. The median concentrations of Hg, Zn, Cr, Pb, and Cd in bamboo surpassed the reference standard (RS) of national food safety limits in vegetables for human intake, but the concentration of Zn was within the nutrient range in the bamboo plants. Heavy metals were enriched more in feces of captive than the wild giant pandas, which illustrated either higher ingestion or lower digestibility for captive giant panda. Ecological risk assessment of soil by the geo-accumulation index (Igeo) and risk index (RI) showed strong pollution by Hg and moderate pollution by Cd.

The results show that even though using efficient bulbs is commonly portrayed as easy, it can involve six phases of additional labor. The case of CFLs indicates that home climate practices beyond light bulbs can add up to significant work, particularly when they require the navigation of toxic or complex shifts in materiality, specialized knowledge, and uncertainties. Because home climate practices like using CFLs are the kind of work traditionally performed by women, they can expand the gender “climate gap” and are often devalued in inequitable ways.

Direct wheeled traffic effects may be alleviated by using access mats that spread traffic impacts over a larger area; however, no scientific assessments of access mat efficacy have been conducted on soil microbial responses. Our objectives were to assess soil properties and the diversity, community structure, and size of soil microbial communities, as impacted by wheeled traffic occurring with and without access mat use on grassland. Two representative sites with differing soil texture (sandy versus loamy) were selected from a set of MGP sites established at the University of Alberta Mattheis Research Ranch in SE Alberta, Canada. Treatments at each site included non-disturbed vegetation controls, areas affected by direct traffic, and grassland with access mats placed for 12 weeks with traffic applied. Soil was sampled in July 2015 (immediately after access mat/traffic treatments ended) and in 2016 (12 months after access mat/traffic treatments) from both sites. Soil DNA was extracted and used to target N-cycling genes via qPCR and for next-generation sequencing (Illumina Miseq) of bacterial, archaeal, and fungal communities. Direct wheeled traffic without access matting increased the size of the N2O-reducing community in the sandy soil and conversely deceased the size of this community in the loamy soil. Non-metric multidimensional scaling, perMANOVA, and indicator species analyses indicated a large effect of traffic without access mat use on fungal community structure, as well as distinct bacterial and fungal indicator OTUs associated with disturbed soils compared to control soils. Fungal community structure remained affected by traffic impacts 12 months later, highlighting the extended impacts of traffic on fungal communities. Access matting mitigated some of the impacts direct traffic had on fungal community structure, but in the loamy site increased soil N and decreased the size of the N2O-reducing bacterial community. The latter indicates that ecosystem functioning of these grasslands may not only be impacted by direct wheeled traffic but also by using matting as a mitigation technique. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Denitrifying; Diversity; Illumina; Mixedgrass prairie; Nitrifying; Nitrogen",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072042242

Hence, there is a necessity to identify the composition, diversity, and function of the soil microbiome in order to determine its natural properties, functioning, and operating range as well as to assess ecotoxicological effects due to anthropogenic activities. Numerous microbiological methods currently exist in the literature and new, more advanced methods continue to be developed; however, only a limited number of these methods are standardised. Consequently, there is a need to identify the most promising non-standardised methods for assessing soil quality and to transform them into standards. In agreement with the ""Ecosystem Service Approach"", new methods should focus more on soil microbial functions, including nutrient cycling and greenhouse gas emission, pest control and plant growth promotion, carbon cycling and sequestration, as well as soil structure development and filter function. The few existing standardised methods available that focus on the function of the soil microbiome mostly include measurements, like basal respiration, enzyme activities, and biodegradation of organic matter, under well-defined conditions in the lab. This paper sets out to summarise and expand on recent discussions within the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), Soil Quality - Biological Characterization sub-committee (ISO TC 190/SC 4), where a need was identified to develop scientifically sound methods which would best fulfil the practical needs of future users for assessing soil quality, going beyond the existing test systems. Of particular note is the current evolution of molecular methods in microbial ecology that use quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) to produce a large number of new functional endpoints which are more sensitive as compared to ""classical"" methods. Quantitative PCR assesses the abundance of microbes that catalyse major transformation steps in nitrogen and phosphorus cycling, greenhouse gas emissions, chemical transformations including pesticide degradation, and plant growth promotion pathways based on the assessment of marker gene sequences that drive the related processes. In the assessment of soil quality methods, it was found that most methods focus on bacteria and related endpoints. Techniques to describe fungal communities as well as their functional traits are far less represented. As such, techniques to analyse fungal enzyme activities are proposed. Additionally, methods for the determination of microbial growth rates and efficiencies, including the use of glomalin as a biochemical marker for soil aggregation, are discussed. Furthermore, field methods indicative of carbon turnover, including the litter bag test and a modification to the tea bag test, are presented. However, it is obvious that with increasing developments in high throughput sequencing technologies and big data analyses, including metagenomics analysis, it will be possible to implement these technologies into the standardisation process for assessing the functions of the soil microbiome. Overall, it is suggested that endpoints should represent a potential function of soil microorganisms rather than actual activity levels, as the latter can largely be dependent on short-term variable soil properties such as pedoclimatic conditions, nutrient availability, and anthropogenic soil cultivation activities. © Author(s) 2020.",,"biodegradation; cultivation; enzyme; enzyme activity; filter; greenhouse gas; microbial ecology; nutrient cycling; pest control; soil aggregate; soil quality; soil structure; standardization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078882545

Response depicted an even distribution of score, with experts endorsing policies like feed-in-tariff, auctions and tax depreciation and the requirement of a strong grid network to assimilate variable power. Commercial and infrastructure variables like cost of capital, credit worthiness of utility, land and road network were marked high.

Design/methodology/approach: The study used household survey methods of data collection. The data were collected using a structured questionnaire survey by interviewing 261 randomly selected smallholder farmers and analysed using both descriptive and inferential data analysis techniques including Participation Index, Adaptation Strategy Index and Binary Logistic Regression Model. Findings: Results of the survey revealed that the vast majority of the respondents perceived the long-term changes in temperature and rainfall pattern. Although they are not transformational in nature, the majority (77 per cent) of the respondents who had perceived changes in climate took adaptive measures. Results of the econometric model analysis revealed that farmers’ perceptions of climate change, extension contact frequency, farmers’ attitude towards adaptation measures, tailor-made training and membership of farmers in peasant associations were found to be significant predictors that positively influenced farmers’ decision behaviour, whereas off-farm employment and the age of the household head were found to be negative and significant determinants. Practical implications: This study, in general, provides an insight into the risk perception, adaptive response and determinants of farmers’ decision behaviour in implementing response strategies and suggests that policies and strategies intended at building the adaptive capacity of the farming community in the study area need to take into account the aforementioned significant factors and framers risk perception, as they highly determine their decision behaviour and help in designing effective and context-specific adaptation strategy. Originality/value: The findings of this study could be informative for policy makers and development practitioners in designing locally specific effective adaptation menu that shapes adaptation to current and future climate risks. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptation strategy; Climate change; Decision behaviour; Risk perceptions","adaptive management; agricultural extension; agricultural research; climate change; farmers attitude; farmers knowledge; risk perception; smallholder; strategic approach; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073966638

Increased water scarcity will exacerbate competition for water resources, not only between sectors but also between countries sharing transboundary river basins. Due to the mutual dependence of the energy sector on water resources and of the water services provision sector on energy inputs, the ‘water-energy’ nexus is acknowledged as a major challenge for the near future – with hydropower representing one of the most direct links in this nexus. The aim of this paper is to assess the economy-wide impacts of the concurrent effects of climate change-driven impacts on water availability and the sectoral and regional competition for scarcer water resources. In order to accomplish that goal, an integrated modelling approach is developed, where a computable general equilibrium model including raw water as a production factor is linked to TIMES_PT, a bottom-up model of the energy sector. A case study is provided for the Mediterranean country of Portugal. Results for 2050 show that macroeconomic impacts are significant, and encompass important inter-sectoral differences that, in turn, depend on the degree of competition between sectors. Impacts are stronger when water consumption by Spanish sectors is considered, as this intensifies water scarcity in Portugal. Thus the paper allows to gain insight in the broader ‘water-energy-economy’ nexus and the additional costs that the dependence on water resources availability in transboundary river basins represents to an economy – both aspects being of utmost importance for climate adaptation and energy policy making. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Computable general equilibrium model; Water resources; ‘Water-energy’ nexus","Climate change; Climate models; Economic and social effects; Public policy; Water supply; Watersheds; Computable general equilibrium model; Integrated modelling approach; Macroeconomic impact; Mediterranean countries; Regional competition; Trans-boundary rivers; Water energy; Water resources availability; Water resources; bottom-up approach; climate change; climate effect; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic impact; integrated approach; water availability; water economics; water resource; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076460712

The objective of this paper is to search the possibility of supplying the load demand with the optimum system that has the lowest net present cost (NPC) and greenhouse emission CO2. The simulation results show that NPC of a proposed grid/PV system, at the current grid's tariff, is more sufficient than other configurations with a result in a renewable fraction of more than 50%, a payback time of 17 years, and 54.3% reduction in CO2. The results also show that the integration of 62 kW PV array with the main grid is the best configuration that leads to the minimum cost of energy (COE) of 0.0688 /kWh and the sell back energy of 9.16% of total energy consumption at Al Baha University. Besides, optimization modeling addresses that HRES-only system can supply the full load demand without power shortage (<0.1%) with a major contribution from solar PV by 78.5%, wind energy shares 11.3% of load demand, and 10.2% from battery banks. The developed analysis concludes that the objective function is feasible for the selected locations. The study has three novelties. Firstly, the required load at different locations of the university's buildings at KSA is supplied by minimizing COE. The objective function is achieved by considering a combination of HRES. Then, it applies the sensitivity analysis for several cases such as payback time, gird's tariff variation, and load demand change. Finally, the current analyses are applicable to any university at KSA and around the world. © 2021 A.

Both NPRI and TRI focus on public opinion to coerce facilities to reduce quantities of emissions, through market pressure, although early reductions in Canada may be attributed to traditional command-and-control mechanisms. NPRI uses a quantity-based approach to report atmospheric and effluent releases of pollutants to air and water, but does not account for relative toxicity of releases, which could lead to harmful chemicals being overlooked. A toxicity-based approach using characterization factors from the USEtox® environmental impact assessment tool was used for this study. Releases of organic and inorganic pollutants to both air and water in Nova Scotia for 2015 were analyzed. Using an ecotoxicity analysis found that the highest priority chemicals identified using the NPRI’s quantity-based approach differed markedly from those identified using the toxicity-based approach. Many of the high-priority chemicals identified using toxicity-based analysis are detrimental to ecosystem health and warrant regulatory attention. The Office of the Auditor General of Canada recently suggested that the Canadian federal government needs to improve control risks of toxic substances. Using a toxicity-based approach may help decision makers in the Canadian federal government effectively control risks of toxic substances and help to inform decision makers, regulators, and Canadians about those risks. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air and water quality; Canada; Ecotoxicity; Environmental pollution; National Pollutant Release Inventory (NPRI); USEtox®","air quality; biomarker; ecosystem health; ecotoxicology; emission inventory; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; state role; water quality; Canada; Nova Scotia; case report; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; Nova Scotia; pollutant; toxicity; United States; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Nova Scotia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076221129

A spatial dispersion modeling of arsenic in fugitive particulates was implemented using AERMOD as a tool for analyzing the impacts of steel complex emissions in southwest of Isfahan, Iran, based on US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Guidelines. Evaluating the model, EPA’s speciate database was used to determine the proportion of the steel plant in air pollution among other sources in the region, and values of arsenic were further compared with those obtained during an 8-h continuous monitoring at 11 downstream receptors. According to the modeling results, sampling locations of air, water, soil, rice and meat downstream the steel plant were identified and collected, and concentrations of arsenic were measured. Finally, the human health risk assessment of arsenic via inhalation, ingestion and dermal exposure was calculated. The performance evaluation of the model showed that AERMOD predictions are reliable for industrial areas, and it can provide useful information for the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) guidelines. The results of arsenic case study show the value of total carcinogenic risk 117 per million, while the hazard index value was found greater than one. Inhalation entry risk attributes the most, and exposure to air, water, food and soil attributes about 66%, 18%, 15% and 0.05% of total risk in the overall region, respectively.

However, to date, no experimental investigations have directly addressed the question of whether high-resolution modeling can increase performance with respect to reproducing meteorological conditions in general; and to spatial distribution of air pollution specifically. In this study, we established a high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting Model-Community Multiscale Air Quality Model with 1 km × 1 km horizontal resolution in the Beijing area. Compared with the 3 km resolution (Case 1), the more detailed land use and land cover in the 1 km resolution (Case 2) result in the improvement of 2-m temperature (T2), while the improvement of 10-m wind speed (WS10) mainly stemmed from implementation of the single urban canopy effect. The more accurate T2 and WS10 jointly lead to a decrease of Planetary Boundary Layer Height in the city. With a better spatially-resolved meteorological field and updated emission inventory, the urban PM2.5 monthly average in Case 2 surpasses Case 1 and the increment of PM2.5 increased alongside the pollution levels, especially above the heavy pollution level. Moreover, the differences in O3 and NOx monthly average between Case 2 and Case 1 negatively correlate across the space. In July, the temporal trend of O3 in Case 2 is closer to observation due to the improvement of T2. Correspondingly, compared to the Case 1, the population weighted PM2.5 concentrations are 2.33% higher while population weighted O3 concentrations are 1.99% lower in Case 2. Overall, the results of Case 2 better capture and reproduce the temporal trends and magnitudes of meteorological conditions and air quality. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; High resolution modeling; Human exposure estimation; LULC; Meteorology","Air quality; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Land use; Meteorology; Wind; Experimental investigations; High-resolution models; Human exposures; Land use and land cover; LULC; Meteorological condition; Planetary boundary layers; Weather research and forecasting models; Weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072736450

Compared to light-duty and medium-duty vehicles, electrification of heavy-duty vehicles, especially Class 8 trucks, is more challenging owing to the battery size required to attain the driving range necessary for their operating goals. As drayage trucks generally have a limited daily mileage, return to a home base every night, and spend a large amount of time creeping and idling, drayage operation has been the first targeted application for Class 8 electric trucks. The feasibility of operating battery electric drayage trucks at the individual vehicle level has recently been demonstrated. However, questions remain as to whether these trucks are capable of meeting the needs of typical drayage operation at the fleet level. This paper presents a feasibility analysis of operating an electric truck fleet based on real-world operation data of a diesel drayage operator in Southern California. Second-by-second activity data collected from 20 trucks in the fleet were used to estimate the corresponding electric energy consumption and the state of charge of the battery using a microscopic electric energy consumption model. An algorithm for generating tours of drayage activity from the collected data was developed and implemented. Multiple scenarios with different battery charging and truck scheduling assumptions were analyzed. The results show that 85% of the tours could be served by electric trucks if there is opportunity for charging at the home base during the time gap between consecutive tours. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",,"Automobiles; Battery electric vehicles; Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Electric utilities; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Secondary batteries; Trucks; Electric energy consumption; Energy independence; Feasibility analysis; Heavy duty vehicles; Real world operations; Southern California; State of charge; Truck scheduling; Fleet operations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101852110

In this research, a combined experimental and numerical study was conducted on the CCB reaction behavior in BF. The CCB used in this study had a composition of 20.10 wt.% carbon, 29.70 wt.% magnetite, 39.70 wt.% wüstite, and 1.57 wt.% metallic iron. Using the prepared CCB samples, isotherm reduction tests under a simulated BF atmosphere (CO‐CO2‐N2) were conducted and a reaction model was developed. Subsequently, the reaction behavior of CCB along the mid‐radial solid descending path in an actual BF of 2500 m3 was analyzed by numerical simulations based on the experimental findings and the previous results of comprehensive BF modeling. The results of the experiments showed that the CCB model predictions agreed well with the experimental measurements. With respect to the BF, the results of the numerical simulations indicated that, along the path, before the CCB temperature reached 1000 K, the CCB was reduced by CO in the BF gas; when its temperature was in the range from 1000 to 1130 K, it underwent self‐reduction and contributed both CO and CO2 to the BF gas; when its temperature was above 1130 K, it only presented carbon gasification. Moreover, these results also revealed that the reduction of iron oxide and the gasification of carbon inside the CCB proceeded under an uneven mode. The uneven radial distribution of the local reduction fraction and local carbon conversion were evident in the selfreducing stage of the CCB. © 2019 by the authors.

Key obstacles to achieving the goal of carbon emission reduction are also identified. The main finding is that the emission reduction capacities of Shanghai, Jiangsu and Zhejiang in China’s east is far greater than that of all other provinces and municipalities, the main obstacle of Shanghai, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang are carbon sinks, energy consumption and carbon emission, and other provinces and municipalities are social and economic development.

Climate change is a problem in the current era because it has a huge impact on the survival of all living things. One way to overcome this is through collaborative governance. Collaborative governance is the right solution to tackle the problem of climate change. Collaborative governance can overcome the problem of climate change by embracing all stakeholders in the public, private and community sectors. This study uses a literature review approach based on search results in the form of journal articles and other relevant articles in this paper, using keywords, restrictions on the year of publication of the article, and the database that has been set. The results of this study indicate that collaborative governance is used by increasing community participation and multilevel governance, but it also has obstacles, namely low community participation so that full government involvement in increasing community participation is needed to support collaborative governance. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Collaborative governances; Community participation; Journal articles; Literature reviews; Living things; Multi-level governance; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081098150

Assessing the systems-level impacts of these energy efficiency improvements is crucial for effective long-term climate change policy- and decision-making. In this study, we developed a framework that integrates process simulation with integrated resource planning and techno-economic assessment techniques to evaluate long-term GHG mitigation potential in the refining sector. Detailed process simulations were done for eleven energy efficiency improvement measures in the refining sector. A case study was conducted for Alberta's (a province in western Canada) refining sector to assess GHG emissions reduction potential and their implications for long-term climate change policy-making. The GHG mitigation scenarios considered time horizons to the years 2030 and 2050. The results show that compared to the reference scenario, integrating the energy efficiency options in the refining sector will result in cumulative emissions reduction of 5%. About 60% of the anticipated emissions reductions are economically attractive. The proposed framework is an effective tool for the evaluation of long-term refining sector GHG mitigation potential and can be used for decision-making and policy formulation at various levels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy efficiency; Energy modelling; GHG abatement cost curves; GHG mitigation scenarios; Petroleum refining; Process simulation","Climate change; Decision making; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum industry; Energy efficiency improvements; Energy modelling; GHG abatements; GHG mitigation; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Integrated resource planning; Process simulations; Techno-economic assessment; Petroleum refining; climate change; decision making; emission control; energy efficiency; greenhouse gas; petroleum; policy making; simulation; Alberta; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075501472

In each of the initial and continuous application fields (3 and 39−51 years, respectively), three plots with different applications of organic matter were established, namely, rice straw application (RS), rice straw compost application (SC) and no application (NA) plots, and soil carbon storage (0−15 cm), rice grain yield and CH4 and N2O fluxes were measured for three years. The soil carbon sequestration rate by the organic matter application was higher in the SC plot than in the RS plot for both the initial and continuous application fields, and it was lower in the continuous application field than in the initial application field. The rice grain yield in the SC plot was significantly higher than those in the other plots in both the initial and continuous application fields. Cumulative CH4 emissions followed the order of the NA plot &lt; the SC plot &lt; the RS plot for both the initial and continuous application fields. The effect of the organic matter application on the N2O emissions was not clear. In both the initial and continuous application fields, the increase in CH4 emission by the rice straw application exceeded the soil carbon sequestration rate, and the change in the net greenhouse gas (GHG) balance calculated by the difference between them was a positive, indicating a net increase in the GHG emissions. However, the change in the GHG balance by the rice straw compost application showed negative (mitigating GHG emissions) for the initial application field, whereas it showed positive for the continuous application field. Although the mitigation effect on the GHG emissions by the combination of the rice straw removal and rice straw compost application was reduced by 21% after 39 years long-term application, it is suggested that the combination treatment is a sustainable management that can mitigate GHG emissions and improve crop productivity. © 2019, © 2019 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.","Methane; nitrous oxide; rice straw; rice straw compost; soil carbon sequestration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065289257

Many people have the right to participate in an ecological democracy: But when protecting biodiversity, who does and should have the right to be heard? I problematize the role that ‘local’ actors play in decision-making and describe the variegated role that experts–particularly biologists–play in ecological democracy when biodiversity preservation matters.

The literature assessing climate policies has shown that assumptions regarding peoples’ distributional preferences for climate change policy impacts are central for policy assessment, but empirical evidence for such preferences is lacking. We design a discrete choice experiment that varies how climate policies affect the income of future generations living in three geographical regions, with distinctly different current and predicted future income levels. The experiment is implemented on a sample of the Danish population and preferences are modelled in a latent class model. Our results show that a small majority of the sample (60%) hold preferences consistent with inequity aversion with respect to future income effects of climate policies across regions. For the same group, we find that preferences for co-benefits for current generations reflect a form of altruism, but not inequity aversion. In both cases, the altruistic aspects are moderated by an element of preferences for positive outcomes in own region too. The remaining classes display preferences with a varying focus on impacts in their own region or simply no support for further climate policy. Our results provide some support for the inclusion of social preferences regarding distributional effects of climate change policies in policy assessments, and hence for the significant impact on policy, this inclusion will have. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Altruism; Choice experiment; Climate change impacts; Inequity aversion; Latent class; Social cost of carbon; Social preferences","Geographical regions; Altruism; Choice experiments; Climate change impact; Inequity aversion; Latent class; Social cost of carbon; Social preference; Climate change; altruism; climate change; discrete choice analysis; environmental policy; equity; experimental study; perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076206816

However, a spatial-detailed and high-precision remote sensing method for the identification of desert vegetation-habitat complexes and characterization of their biophysical processes remain scarce. Here, we developed an innovative cross-wavelet transform (XWT)-based approach coupled with logistic regression to extract critical vegetation-habitat interaction characteristics in order to identify, map, and understand their complex ecological processes. Fine intraannual profiles between the green vegetation (GV) fraction and habitat fractions including dark material (DA), saline land (SA), sand land (SL) were unmixed by Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) from 16-period Gaofen-1 (GF-1) wide field of view (WFV) images in Minqin County, after which XWT was performed to extract feedback characteristics as feature parameters. Major principal components (PCs) were obtained from those feature parameters to reduce dimensions and solve multicollinearity, logistic regression was applied for mapping. The results demonstrate that the proposed procedure efficiently reproduced desert vegetation-habitat complexes with high accuracy (overall accuracy: 87.33%; Kappa coefficient: 0.86) in the entire Minqin County, representing a 3.42% overall accuracy increase relative to a previously published decision tree (DT) method. The new method also had a lower quantity and allocation disagreement. Moreover, this procedure not only achieved comparable accuracy to that of an optimized Support Vector Machine (SVM) and superior to a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based U-net model, but also explored biophysical processes and complex relationships with better interpretability. Therefore, the developed approach has the potential for accurately monitoring the highly heterogeneous dryland landscape and characterizing the land degradation processes in the spectral endmember space of fine spatial-temporal remote sensing data. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cross-wavelet transform; Desert vegetation-habitat complex; Endmembers fraction series; Feature parameters; Logistic regression","Climate change; Complex networks; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Landforms; Neural networks; Photomapping; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Space optics; Support vector machines; Vegetation; Cross-wavelet transform; Desert vegetation-habitat complex; Endmembers; Feature parameters; Logistic regressions; Wavelet transforms; accuracy assessment; climate change; dryland farming; environmental protection; field of view; global climate; land degradation; mapping method; parameter estimation; principal component analysis; regression analysis; remote sensing; satellite data; support vector machine; transform; vegetation dynamics; wavelet analysis; China; Gansu; Minqin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074971869

Therefore, we proposed the community carbon accumulation rate (CAR) from the start of the growing season (SOS) to the peak of the growing season (POS) to fill the gap that the dynamic interactions between plant phenology and plant carbon research. Location: Tibetan Plateau. Major taxa: Alpine grassland plants. Time period: 2015. Methods: We conducted a transect survey across grasslands to measure community aboveground net primary production and carbon concentration. Additionally, phenology indicator data (SOS and POS) were extracted from the Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies (GIMMS) normalized difference vegetation index version 3 database. Next, we used ‘changepoint’ analysis to detect the patterns of CARs, and performed linear regression and one-way ANOVA to explore the variability of CARs in response to the environmental factors. Ultimately, the total effects of environmental factors on CARs were illustrated by a structural equation model. Results: Our results indicated that three CAR patterns were detected, which are low-CAR (0.15 g/m2/day), medium-CAR (0.31 g/m2/day) and high-CAR (0.84 g/m2/day) patterns. We found that the availabilities of water and heat mediated CARs by regulating soil nutrition variability, and that drought climate and insufficient soil resources co-constrained the community CAR at long time-scales. In contrast, high CAR could be explained by more water and heat availability via either direct or indirect effects on soil moisture and soil nutrients. Main conclusions: Our findings highlight that water and heat availability are critical driving factors in ecological carbon accumulation processes undergoing climate change. Meanwhile, the vegetative phenology also has important effect on carbon accumulation. Consequently, we propose incorporating the dynamic interactions between plant phenology and plant carbon into the ecological carbon cycle model to improve our understanding of resource utilization and survival strategies of plants under environmental change. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","alpine grassland; carbon accumulation rate; climate change; dryland; Tibetan Plateau; time-scale","aboveground production; alpine environment; climate change; data set; future prospect; growing season; phenology; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074647050

The topic of the functional ecological role of forests is urgent due to the problem of climate warming and an increase in the level of carbon dioxide concentration in the atmosphere. Currently, a differentiated (regional) approach to assessing the biological productivity of stands and their carbon-removing ability is important, which allows a detailed approach to organizing monitoring of the ecological balance and using the resource potential of forest ecosystems of a certain territory. The aim of this work was to assess the carbon-removing ability of modal stands of Siberian fir based on the study of the dynamics of the fractional composition of phytomass in the process of planting development. The studies were conducted in the conditions of the Central Siberian subtaiga forest-steppe region of the Krasnoyarsk Territory (the territory of the Bolshemurtinsky forestry). The object of research was fir stands of the third class bonitet. In the work, materials were used for eye-tracking taxation of 456 sections. The dynamics of the fractional composition was calculated using the conversion-volumetric method (Ph/M conversion) on the basis of the developed table of the growth course, followed by the conversion of the studied fir plantations to the carbon reserves deposited by the tree layer. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Biotechnology; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Eye tracking; Taxation; Biological productivity; Carbon dioxide concentrations; Carbon sequestration; Ecological balance; Forest-steppe zone; Fractional composition; Resource potentials; Volumetric methods; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078404552

This was put into practice for forest inventory work and the estimation of biomass and carbon stocks. The aim was to use classic scientific approaches of inventory and cartography, but involving local populations in the different stages of the process. The involvement of local populations, through the mobilization of their indigenous knowledge, significantly increases data quality and considerably reduces the costs and duration of the evaluation process. Ultimately, only 2% of the trees inventoried were “unknown” by local botanists, 92.3% of the species identified by them had accurate scientific correspondences. Help of local actors contributed to halving the time required to set up the plots and reduced the cost of operations by twenty times compared with using experts.

Although most studies have explored the driving forces behind carbon emissions, there is still considerable room to improve the methods of previous research. This study therefore built an extended Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model, combined with partial least squares regression (PLSR) to analyse the influencing factors of city-level carbon emissions from 2008 to 2017 in Fujian province, China. Compared to most methods used in previous studies, the STIRPAT-PLSR model can eliminate multi-collinearity and residuals, which enables it to display better decomposition characteristics. The results revealed that the total carbon emissions in Fujian province was 16577 × 104 tonnes of carbon in 2017, with an increase of 39.85% compared with that in 2008. In terms of spatial distribution, carbon emissions in the coastal regions were more than those in the inland areas. Meanwhile, the positive drivers of urban carbon emissions in Fujian include population, urbanization rate, per capita GDP, primary industry ratio, secondary industry ratio, and energy intensity, with cumulative contributions (mean value) of 95.21, 110.97, 103.95, 99.89, 109.17 and 96.35%, respectively. Furthermore, the tertiary industry ratio displays an inhibition effect, and every 1% increase in the tertiary sector's share of GDP is associated with a 0.776% (mean value) reduction in carbon emissions in Fujian. Additionally, city-scale spatial differences in and distribution patterns of carbon emissions within the same province, which will aid decision making in terms of carbon trading and ecological compensation mechanisms. Therefore, the policymakers should formulate reduction policies according to the characteristics of the city based on the vital driving factors, including industrial restructuring and upgrading, promoting eco-urbanization construction, which can be considered as a valid solution for win-win targets of regional economic development and carbon emissions reduction. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Factor decomposition; Spatial layout; STIRPAT-PLSR model","Decision making; Economics; Emission control; Least squares approximations; Regional planning; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Carbon emissions; Carbon emissions reductions; Decomposition characteristics; Factor decompositions; Partial least squares regressions (PLSR); Regional economic development; Spatial layout; Stirpat; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073739155

With increasing urbanisation along with global mobility that demands not only safe but equitable, efficient and clean (reduced carbon footprint) transport, the responses to dealing with the burgeoning road traffic injury in low- and middle-income countries has become increasingly complex. In this paper, we apply unique methods to identify important strategies that could be implemented to reduce road traffic injury in the Asia-Pacific region; a region comprising large middle-income countries (China and India) that are currently in the throes of rapid motorisation. Using a convolutional neural network approach, we clustered countries containing a total of 1632 cities from around the world into groups based on urban characteristics related to road and public transport infrastructure. We then analysed 20 countries (containing 689 cities) from the Asia-Pacific region and assessed the global burden of disease attributed to road traffic injury and these various urban characteristics. This study demonstrates the utility of employing image recognition methods to discover new insights that afford urban and transport planning opportunities to mitigate road traffic injury at a regional and global scale. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","city clusters; Neural networks; road traffic injury; urbanisation","city; human; injury; prevention and control; traffic accident; traffic and transport; Accidents, Traffic; Cities; Humans; Transportation; Wounds and Injuries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077153051

Combinations of long-standing and emerging problems in these urban areas generate vulnerability for human well-being and ecosystems alike. This baseline study provides a spatially explicit global systematization of these problems into typical urban vulnerability profiles for the year 2000 using largely sub-national data. Using 11 indicator datasets for urban expansion, urban population growth, marginalization of poor populations, government effectiveness, exposures and damages to climate-related extreme events, low-lying settlement, and wetlands prevalence, a cluster analysis reveals a global typology of seven clearly distinguishable clusters, or urban profiles of vulnerability. Each profile is characterized by a specific data-value combination of indicators representing mechanisms that generate vulnerability. Using 21 studies for testing the plausibility, we identify seven key profile-based vulnerabilities for urban populations, which are relevant in the context of global urbanization, expansion, and climate change. We show which urban coasts are similar in this regard. Sensitivity and exposure to extreme climate-related events, and government effectiveness, are the most important factors for the huge asymmetries of vulnerability between profiles. Against the background of underlying global trends we propose entry points for profile-based vulnerability reduction. The study provides a baseline for further pattern analysis in the rapidly urbanizing coastal fringe as data availability increases. We propose to explore socio-ecologically similar coastal urban areas as a basis for sharing experience and vulnerability-reducing measures among them. © 2020 Sterzel et al.

At timescales comparable to those of Milankovitch cycles, late Cenozoic building/melting of continental ice sheets, erosion, and sea level changes can affect magmatism, which provides an opportunity to explore possible feedbacks between climate and volcanic changes. Existing data show that extinction of Neo-Tethyan volcanic arcs is largely synchronous with phases of atmospheric carbon reduction, suggesting waning degassing as a possible contribution to climate cooling throughout the early to middle Cenozoic. In addition, the increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations during the last deglaciation may be ascribed to enhanced volcanism and carbon emissions due to unloading of active magmatic provinces on continents. The deglacial rise in atmospheric CO2 points to a mutual feedback between climate and volcanism mediated by the redistribution of surface masses and carbon emissions. This may explain the progression to higher amplitude and increasingly asymmetric cycles of late Cenozoic climate oscillations. Unifying theories relating tectonic, erosional, climatic, and magmatic changes across timescales via the carbon cycle offer an opportunity for future research into the coupling between surface and deep Earth processes. ©2019.

A collaborative modeling research program in the Truckee River Basin iteratively convenes researchers and local water managers to (1) assess water management challenges under climate change, (2) identify strategies to adapt water management, (3) prioritize research and modeling activities, and (4) collaboratively review findings. This paper presents selected research program results that identify fixed date-based reservoir operations based on stationary climate as a barrier to adapt to warmer temperatures, earlier Sierra Nevada snowmelt runoff, and shifts in streamflow timing. Using an integrated hydrologic and operations model tailored to the river basin, researchers demonstrate that under a warmer climate, earlier peak streamflow compromises reservoir storage. Simulations that allow for earlier storage absorb streamflow timing shifts, providing measurable benefits upstream in the reservoir and downstream for diverse water-use communities. Researchers review simulation results with managers to assess the on-the-ground potential and identify additional research opportunities that meet local information needs.

The prevalence rate of Onychomycosis occurrence is estimated on the basis of age due to poor peripheral circulation or diabetes, climate, reduced growth of nail, immunodeficiency condition and modern lifestyle leading to absence of nail maintenance. The percentage of affected children are less compared to the adults or elderly people. Most of the rural people are affected by this disease. In fishing community people the prevalence rate is very high. Awareness of the disease among the people is uncertain. Hence, the diagnosis of the disease is delayed which results in less chances for the cure of the disease.

Because of their long- uninterrupted- sedimentation history, the delta-fan repositories of the large rivers are also thought to be excellent paleo-climate archives. Being one of the largest, the delta-fan of the Ganges-Brahmaputra (G-B) River system has been extensively studied. OM-based paleo-vegetation proxy records, recovered from the floodplain archive, however, showed poor concurrence with the G-B delta-fan records. Using carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) of modern C3 and C4 plant produced OM, soil, and bedload sediments from the lower Gangetic plain, we have shown that riverine sediments and therefore delta-fan sedimentary archives fail to capture the floodplain vegetation composition in terms of C3–C4 plant abundance. The bias arises because of the faster removal of complete C4, and partial degradation of C3 plant derived carbon during OM transfer from plant to the soil, before its final storage in the delta-fan archives. Using a global compilation of riverine OM ages and their δ13C values, we propose that multiple deposition-erosion cycles of sediments, during its transportation through large River systems, possibly cause sedimentary OM ageing and play a key role in determining the quality of OM based proxy records. We, therefore, suggest that bulk OM ages are necessary to assess the quality of OM based proxy records when retrieving paleo-climate information from the large delta-fan archives. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon isotope; Delta-fan sediments; Large river systems; Organic matter; Paleo-vegetation","Banks (bodies of water); Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Carbon; Climate change; Floods; Isotopes; Organic compounds; Sedimentology; Sediments; Vegetation; Carbon isotopes; Carbon isotopic composition; Climate information; Large river system; Partial degradation; Plant-derived carbon; Terrestrial organic matter; Vegetation composition; Rivers; abundance; C3 plant; C4 plant; carbon isotope; climate change; community structure; delta; deltaic sedimentation; floodplain; fluvial deposit; organic matter; paleoclimate; proxy climate record; river system",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075923617

Recent research has found that science communicators and advocates may be judged for inconsistency between their behavior and advocacy—where information that an advocate's lifestyle has a large carbon footprint can undermine their appeals to live more sustainably or support policies to address climate change. Conversely, in other advocacy domains, research on do-gooder derogation has found that exemplary behavior among advocates can lead people to feel defensive about their own shortcomings and reject the exemplar and their cause. Do environmental advocates have to worry about both do-gooder derogation and behavior-advocacy inconsistency? Further, do different types of advocates have to worry about these pitfalls equally? To answer these questions, we use an online survey in the United States (N = 2362) to contrast the effectiveness of advocacy from peers and from experts across three levels of sustainable lifestyles: not sustainable, somewhat sustainable, and highly sustainable. We find strong evidence for the negative effects of behavior-advocacy inconsistency for both neighbors and experts, albeit much larger impacts for experts. Further, we also find partial evidence for do-gooder derogation for neighbors and experts: highly sustainable advocates were not more influential than somewhat sustainable ones—instead they were marginally worse. Overall, these results suggest that advocates, especially experts, are most credible and influential when they adopt many sustainable behaviors in their day-to-day lives, so long as they are not seen as too extreme. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Advocacy; Behavior; Climate change; Communication; Persuasion; Renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072581542

This paper aims to compare the impact of climate change on the energy performance of residential buildings in order to derive potential design strategies. Different climate file inputs of Madrid have been used to quantify comparatively the thermal needs of two reference residential buildings located in this city. One of them represents buildings older than 40 years built according to the applicable Spanish regulations prior to 1979. The other refers to buildings erected in the last decade under more energy-restrictive constructive regulations. Three different climate databases of Madrid have been used to assess the impact of the evolution of the climate in recent years on the thermal demands of these two reference buildings. Two of them are typical meteorological years (TMY) derived from weather data measured before 2000. On the contrary, the third one is an experimental file representing the average values of the meteorological variables registered in Madrid during the last decade. Annual and monthly comparisons are done between the three climate databases assessing the climate changes. Compared to the TMYs databases, the experimental one records an average air temperature of 1.8 °C higher and an average value of relative humidity that is 9% lower. © 2020 MDPI AG.

These mechanisms depend strongly on skull morphology and have high variability across individuals. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of human transcranial super-resolution imaging using a geometrical focusing approach to efficiently concentrate energy at the region of interest, and a phase correction focusing approach that takes the skull morphology into account. It is shown that using the proposed focused super-resolution method, we can image a 208-μ m microtube behind a human skull phantom in both an out-of-plane and an in-plane configuration. Individual phase correction profiles for the temporal region of the human skull were calculated and subsequently applied to transmit-receive a custom focused super-resolution imaging sequence through a human skull phantom, targeting the 208-μ m diameter microtube at 68.5 mm in depth and at 2.5 MHz. Microbubble contrast agents were diluted to a concentration of 1.6× 106 bubbles/mL and perfused through the microtube. It is shown that by correcting for the skull aberration, the RF signal amplitude from the tube improved by a factor of 1.6 in the out-of-plane focused emission case. The lateral registration error of the tube's position, which in the uncorrected case was 990 μ m, was reduced to as low as 50 μ m in the corrected case as measured in the B-mode images. Sensitivity in microbubble detection for the phase-corrected case increased by a factor of 1.48 in the out-of-plane imaging case, while, in the in-plane target case, it improved by a factor of 1.31 while achieving an axial registration correction from an initial 1885-μ m error for the uncorrected emission, to a 284-μ m error for the corrected counterpart. These findings suggest that super-resolution imaging may be used far more generally as a clinical imaging modality in the brain. © 1986-2012 IEEE.","Brain mapping; brain vasculature; contrast-enhanced ultrasound; microbubbles; phase aberration correction; super resolution; transcranial; transcranial focusing","Brain mapping; Errors; Focusing; Image segmentation; Morphology; Optical resolving power; Phantoms; Ultrasonic imaging; Brain vasculature; Contrast enhanced ultrasound; Microbubbles; Phase aberration correction; Super resolution; Transcranial; Aberrations; contrast medium; algorithm; brain; brain mapping; chemistry; diagnostic imaging; echography; human; image processing; imaging phantom; microbubble; procedures; skull; Algorithms; Brain; Brain Mapping; Contrast Media; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Microbubbles; Phantoms, Imaging; Skull; Ultrasonography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077295521

For many years along the U.S. Gulf Coast, acidic precipitation has been measured. Measurements along the Mexican Gulf Coast were begun in 2003. The aim of this study was to evaluate pH, sulfate, nitrate and ammonium concentrations in wet atmospheric deposition, collected daily from 2003 to 2015 at La Mancha (LM), Veracruz and compare the values with the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) sampling sites located along the U.S. coast of the Gulf of Mexico. The annual Volume Weighted Mean (VWM) pH in wet deposition at La Mancha site ranged from 4.81 to 5.40, which is similar to the U.S. Gulf sites. Additionally, the annual VWM SO4 2− concentration was from 15 to 31 μeq/L, which is higher than the U.S. sites. Annual VWM NO3 − concentrations were from of 3.5 to 15 μeq/L, which is lower than all the U.S. sites. At the Mexican site, the SO4 2−/NO3 − ratio was 4.90 and higher than all of the U.S. sites, which were between 1.03 and 2.38. For LM, the median NH4 +/NO3 − ratio was 0.77, similar to the Florida sites (0.53–0.91), and below the values measured for Louisiana and Texas (1.07–1.5). The Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory Model (HYSPLIT) was applied in order to identify the emission sources for the pollutants seen at LM. Trajectories showed an important transport to LM from the East (open water) during the rainy season. The region located East of La Mancha shows offshore petroleum operations as sources of acid rain precursors and deposition of acidifying and nitrogen containing compounds. It is important to consider the sulfur dioxide emission sources in the Mexico Gulf region, and to extend the atmospheric deposition sampling to other sites along the Mexican Gulf coast and Cuba. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Acid rain; Atmospheric deposition; Gulf of Mexico; Nitrate; Sulfate","Acid rain; Atmospheric movements; Deposition; Importance sampling; Lanthanum; Meteorological problems; Nitrates; Offshore oil well production; Sulfur dioxide; Acidic precipitation; Ammonium concentrations; Atmospheric depositions; Chemical compositions; Gulf of Mexico; National atmospheric deposition programs; Sulfate; Sulfur dioxide emissions; Atmospheric chemistry; ammonia; nitrate; nitrogen derivative; sulfate; sulfur derivative; sulfur dioxide; acid rain; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; coastal zone; concentration (composition); nitrogen compound; pollutant source; sampling; sulfur; wet deposition; Article; chemical composition; concentration (parameter); Cuba; Florida; Gulf of Mexico; pH; priority journal; seashore; seasonal variation; trend study; wet deposition; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; La Mancha [Veracruz]; Mexico [North America]; United States; Veracruz",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074341944

Given that transportation has become a leading component of urban greenhouse gas emissions, combining sustainable performance assessment with transportation emissions is crucial to urban sustainability. In this study, pointed at the unbalance between urban development and transportation accessibility among urban central activities zones, a metric named potential traffic attraction is proposed based on improved gravitational model to measure urban sustainable performance. Meanwhile, the correlation between the traffic attraction and the high-emission traffic is generated via GPS trajectories, which could ensure the credibility of high-emission travel mode for the correlation model.

By combining the N and oxygen (O) isotopes of atmospheric NO3 −, stable isotope mixing models were recently applied to evaluate the relative contributions of major NOx sources. However, it has long been unresolved how to accurately constrain the δ15N differences between NO3 − and corresponding NOx (ε(NO2→NO3−) values). Here, we first incorporated the HC oxidation (NO2 → NO3 −) pathway by using Δ17O values to evaluate the ε(NO2→NO3−) values, performed on NO3 − in PM2.5 collected during the day and at night from January 4–13, 2015 at an urban site in Beijing. We found that the Δ17O-based ε values (ε17O-based(NO2→NO3−)) (15.6 ± 7.4‰) differed distinctly from δ18O-based ε values (ε18O-based(NO2→NO3−)) (33.0 ± 9.5‰) so did not properly incorporate the isotopic effects of the HC oxidation (NO2 → NO3 −) pathway. Based on the ε(NO2→NO3−) values, δ15N values of NOx from coal combustion (CC), vehicle exhausts (VE), biomass burning (BB), and the microbial N cycle (MC), as well as NO3 − in PM2.5, we further quantified the source contributions by using Stable Isotope Analysis in R (the SIAR model). We found that the respective fractional contributions of CC-NOx and MC-NOx were underestimated by 64% and were overestimated by 216% by using ε18O-based(NO2→NO3−) values. We concluded that the new ε17O-based(NO2→NO3−) values reduced uncertainties in contribution analysis and the evaluation method for atmospheric NO3 − sources. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Isotopic fractionation; Nitrate aerosol; Nitrogen isotopes; Oxygen isotopes; Source apportionment","Coal combustion; Isotopes; Nitrates; Oxygen; Uncertainty analysis; Urban growth; Isotopic fractionations; Nitrate aerosols; Nitrogen isotopes; Oxygen isotopes; Source apportionment; Nitrogen oxides; nitrate; nitrogen; nitrogen oxide; oxygen; aerosol; atmospheric chemistry; isotopic fractionation; nitrate; nitrogen isotope; nitrogen oxides; oxygen isotope; particulate matter; source apportionment; Article; atmospheric deposition; biomass; chemical analysis; China; combustion; controlled study; exhaust gas; oxidation; particulate matter; priority journal; urban area; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074809824

Promoting the efficiency of energy use and developing clean energy are the only two economically feasible approaches for the future. However, without low-carbon technology, pursuing green growth could negatively affect production activities. In this study, we develop a directional distance function (DDF) model based on the slacks of the output-oriented slack-based measure. Along an endogenously determined directional vector, we can calculate the efficiency scores by reducing the undesirable output and expanding desirable output simultaneously. The global Malmquist index is integrated with the DDF model to capture the dynamic change of output performance. Based on the output performance of green growth, we use counterfactual thinking to evaluate GDP losses caused by limiting carbon emissions. The empirical study using the provincial data of China shows that technological progress, not efficiency change, pushes green growth in China. We also find that pursuing green growth in China would lead to a GDP loss of 7%–8%. Furthermore, a sub-regional analysis shows that the eastern regions were almost immune to the strict carbon-control policy, while the midwestern regions were affected severely. To alleviate the GDP loss, we offer suggestion on setting up a green growth sharing mechanism among regions. © 2019","Counterfactual thinking; Directional distance function; Global malmquist index; Green growth; Sharing mechanism","Carbon; Regional planning; Counterfactual thinking; Directional distance function; Green growths; Malmquist indices; Sharing mechanism; Function evaluation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067228444

The role of air pollution exposure to racial/ethnic differences in hypertension has not been explored. Objective: To assess the potential mediating effects of ambient air pollution on the association between race/ethnicity and blood pressure levels. Methods: We studied 6,463 White, Black, Hispanic and Chinese adults enrolled across 6 US cities. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were measured at Exam 1 (2000–2002) and Exam 2 (2002–2004). Household-level annual average concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), oxides of nitrogen (NOX), and ozone (O3) for the year 2000 were estimated for participants. Results: The difference in SBP levels by race/ethnicity that was related to higher PM2.5 concentrations compared with White men (“indirect associations”) was 0.3 (95% CI: 0.1, 0.6) mmHg for Black men, 0.3 (95% CI: 0.1, 0.6) mmHg for Hispanic men and 1.0 (95% CI: 0.2, 1.8) mmHg for Chinese men. Findings were similar although not statistically significant for women. PM2.5 did not mediate racial/ethnic differences in DBP. Indirect associations were significant for O3 for SBP among women and men and for DBP among men. In contrast, racial/ethnic disparities were attenuated due to exposure to NOX. Conclusion: Racial disparities in blood pressure were reduced after accounting for PM2.5 and ozone while increased after accounting for NOX. © 2019","Air pollution; Blood pressure; Disparities; Hypertension; Race/ethnicity","nitrogen oxide; ozone; nitric oxide; ozone; ambient air; atmospheric pollution; blood; correlation; ethnic group; hypertension; neighborhood; particulate matter; pollution exposure; public health; racial identity; adult; aged; air pollution; ambient air; Article; atherosclerosis; Black person; blood pressure; Caucasian; Chinese; diastolic blood pressure; ethnicity; Hispanic; human; hypertension; major clinical study; particulate matter; priority journal; race; systolic blood pressure; air pollutant; drug effect; environmental exposure; ethnic group; ethnology; female; male; toxicity; United States; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Atherosclerosis; Blood Pressure; Environmental Exposure; Ethnic Groups; Female; Humans; Male; Nitric Oxide; Ozone; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073445020

Following an exploratory process-tracing method, we investigate how policymaking authority originally delegated to the EU becomes contested by the member states and how these authority conflicts are managed.

However, no definition was introduced into the legislation until 2020, preventing efficient identification of energy poor households. In a context where most energy poor households use coal for heating and where cities are plagued by local air pollution caused by the combustion of solid fuels, the issue of energy poverty is strongly linked to coal as an energy source for heating. On the one hand, combating local air pollution and climate change implies reducing the use of coal. On the other hand, certain stakeholders argue that replacing coal as a source of heating energy would increase energy poverty. To deal with the issue of energy poverty, no dedicated support instruments for energy poor households have been set up to date. The issue is only indirectly dealt with by social support policies, but these are strictly related to the incomes of households. As only half of Polish energy poor households are simultaneously income poor, this implies that 50 percent of energy poor households are presumably left with no social support. Poor targeting can be observed in thermal retrofit policies as well, which offer loans rather than subsidies and which are currently limited to detached houses. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, George Jiglau, Anca Sinea, Ute Dubois, and Philipp Biermann; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096256999

A method for calculating the porosity of carbon fiber plastic composites based on the measured acoustic impedance is presented. Composite samples with three different carbon fiber layers stacking schemes were investigated. It is shown that in the studied composites, the local porosity distribution is nonuniform along the fiber stacking plane. The porosity value, averaged from optoacoustic measurement results, actually coincides with X-ray tomography data within the error limits. The presented method for determining porosity does not require determining the volume and mass of the studied object and can be used for investigation of composite structures with complex shapes. © 2020, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","laser optoacoustic method; longitudinal acoustic waves; polymer composites; porosity","Acoustic waves; Acoustooptical effects; Carbon fiber reinforced plastics; Fibers; Laser excitation; Photoacoustic effect; Plastic optical fibers; Porosity; Porous carbon; Reinforcement; Carbon fiber-reinforced plastic composites; Composite samples; Fiber plastic composites; Local porosity distribution; Longitudinal acoustic waves; Optoacoustic method; Polymer composite; Porosity assessments; Acoustic impedance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082038750

Moreover, the knowledge of the particulate matter (PM) chemical composition for the different size fractions is recognized as increasingly important, in particular with respect to health effects of exposed population. This study is focused on the characterization of PM10 and PM2.5 main sources located in the Civitavecchia harbor-industrial area (Central Italy), namely a large coal-fired power plant, a natural gas power plant, the harbor area, the vehicular traffic (due to both the local traffic and the highway crossing the area) and small industrial activities. The approach was based on PM10/PM2.5 samples monthly collected for one year and a further relative chemical characterization of organic and inorganic fractions. Wind-select sensors, allowing a selective PM10 and PM2.5 sampling downwind to specific emission sources, were used for the overall sampling. This methodology manages to explain specific emission patterns and to assess the concentration levels of the micro pollutants emitted by local sources and particularly toxic for health. A descriptive statistical analysis of data was performed, also verifying the occurrence of legislative threshold exceedances. Moreover, in order to highlight the contribution of specific sources, the differences in the measured micro pollutants concentrations between wind directions, PM size fractions and sampling sites have been investigated, as well as the seasonal trends of pollutants concentrations.

Since SOC content of soils cannot be easily measured, a key barrier to implementing programmes to increase SOC at large scale, is the need for credible and reliable measurement/monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) platforms, both for national reporting and for emissions trading. Without such platforms, investments could be considered risky. In this paper, we review methods and challenges of measuring SOC change directly in soils, before examining some recent novel developments that show promise for quantifying SOC. We describe how repeat soil surveys are used to estimate changes in SOC over time, and how long-term experiments and space-for-time substitution sites can serve as sources of knowledge and can be used to test models, and as potential benchmark sites in global frameworks to estimate SOC change. We briefly consider models that can be used to simulate and project change in SOC and examine the MRV platforms for SOC change already in use in various countries/regions. In the final section, we bring together the various components described in this review, to describe a new vision for a global framework for MRV of SOC change, to support national and international initiatives seeking to effect change in the way we manage our soils. © 2019 The Authors.

After 2003, the early engagement of communities with renewables was almost exclusively through development trusts, acting alone or collaboratively. More recently, cooperatives and benefit societies have become more common. Informed by ideas from social innovation, this paper explores the evolution of the support ecosystem for community renewables and examines the influence of institutional structures on social, economic and environmental outcomes. Recent changes in UK policy have made social innovation in community energy much more challenging, although shared ownership/shared revenue models remain an opportunity to be more deeply explored. Three main models of ownership are explored: the community development trust; the cooperative or community benefit society and the shared ownership model, where the community entity is normally a development trust. While the small number of cases examined limits the scope for generalisation, the community development trust appears to offer the greatest range and scale of local beneficial outcomes for sustainable rural development, but the level of impact on emissions reduction varies and the primary motive has most often been income generation for local development. © 2020 The Authors","Community; Impacts; Institutions; Renewables; Scotland",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091565689

Drought is characterized by both hydrological and climatological factors. Due to the change in climate and reduced rainfall, water demand has been on the rise. This scarcity of water affects both surface water and ground water. Monitoring, predicting and evaluating the effects of such natural disasters at all levels is possible with the use of geospatial technology. Recent advancements in remote sensing and GIS techniques enable quick and extensive monitoring and mapping of drought occurrence and recurrence in a locality. In this paper, one of the most drought-prone regions in Tamilnadu, India, namely, Namakkal district is studied. Certain indicators of agricultural drought with the help of satellite images have been derived and assessed. Broadband indices such as Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) and Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) are derived and analysed for the understanding of setting in droughts in the locality. A drought assessment map indicating the areas prone to drought was derived and the zonation map thus obtained will be useful for the agriculturists and farmers in order to plan their farming practices. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.

The major components are plastic (PE and PP), food and kitchen waste, and paper, whereas the minor components are textile, rubber, and biomass. Reactions were conducted in small drop tube fixed bed reactor with isothermal reaction temperature at 700, 800, and 900 °C. Steam was supplied as the gasifying agent for the main purpose of producing hydrogen-rich gas. Pyrolysis was also conducted at the same condition to observe the characteristic differences. Producer gas, including H2, CH4, and CO, of both the reactions was a function of the temperature, whereas CO2 showed a reversed trend when the reaction temperature was increased. Simple kinetic models of those gaseous formations were studied for describing the related parameters. It is challenging to determine the kinetics of the individual gas generation while most kinetic studies have focused on mass deterioration. The commonly used kinetic model of nucleation of Avrami-Erofe'ev (A2) could well predict the mechanism of the gas formation of gasification. In parallel, the pyrolysis conformed to the A3 model due to the slower rate of char and tar decomposition when the gasifying agent was absent. The activation energy of each gaseous species and the fitting of experimental data with the selected models are examined in this study.

Roadside plantations often act as a first defense line against the vehicular emissions to mitigate the impacts of pollutants. However, they are themselves vulnerable to these pollutants with varying levels of tolerance capacity. This demands a scientific investigation to assess the role of roadside plantation for better management and planning for urban sprawl where selected trees could be grown to mitigate the impacts of harmful pollutants. The present study assesses the impacts of vehicular emissions on the adaptation and mitigation potential of two important roadside tree species i.e. Grevillea robusta and Mangifera indica planted along roadsides in the capital city of Uttarakhand. Uttarakhand is one of the Indian Western Himalayan State and its capital city is situated on the foothills of Himalaya. The adaptation and mitigation potential were evaluated by studying the response of pollutants on the functional traits which drive the physiology of the trees. The CO2 assimilation rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, water use efficiency (WUE), air pollution tolerance index (APTI), copper and proline accumulation, dust removal efficiency (DRE), leaf thickness and cooling created by plantation were studied to evaluate the response of trees exposed to roadside traffics. To compare the influence of pollutants, traits of trees grown in a control site with few or absence of vehicular movement were compared with the roadside trees. The control site represented part of a reserve forest where human interference is controlled and human-induced activities are prohibited. The vehicular frequency was found to modulate tree characteristics. The tree characteristics representing WUE, APTI, proline and copper accumulation, leaf thickness, cooling impact, and DRE were enhanced significantly, while the decreased CO2 assimilation rate was observed near roadside trees compared to the control site. We found both of the species to perform well to be used as one of the potential species for roadside and urban greening. However, there is a need to assess the potential of other species in reference to the present study. © 2020 Singh et al.

Therefore, many local communities are preparing adaptation plans. Even so, much of what was done has not been published in the peer-reviewed literature. This means that consideration of adaptation options for local communities is limited. With the objective of assisting in the development of adaptation plans, we present 80 adaptation options suitable for coastal communities that can be applied by local governments. They are a catena of options from defend to co-exist and finally, retreat that progresses as impacts become less manageable. Options are organized according to their capacity to protect local properties and infrastructure, natural systems, food production, availability of fresh and drinking water and well-being of the local population, as these are likely to be affected by climate change. To respond to multiple threats, 'soft' options, such as awareness raising, planning, political articulation and financial incentives, insurance and professional skills enhancement, can be encouraged immediately at relatively low cost and are reversible. For specific threats, options emphasize change in management practices as pre-emptive measures.

There is some uncertainty about how quickly the climate will change and what the anticipated localised effects will be. There are also governance questions, for instance, who has the mandate to make decisions around the management of collective resources (like council infrastructure) and private property. Underlying these questions are issues of justice, equity and agency–who pays for the costs of adaptation and mitigation, and how do decision-makers engage with communities when what is ultimately needed is transformational socio-economic change? We use a case study in Te Awa Kairangi–Lower Hutt, Wellington, to show how a community initiative called Common Unity Project Aotearoa (CUPA) is fostering everyday practices of adaptation and mitigation amongst people who have traditionally had limited participation in more formal planning processes. We use the example of CUPA to demonstrate the significance of local community-led development initiatives for adapting to a changing climate.

Through activities including community input sessions, task force and other stakeholder group meetings, the project team learned early on that it was essential to carefully (and frequently) vet details of proposed actions with the subject matter experts at the City. While the community engagement activities held proved instrumental, additional engagement would have been ideal. There are significant start-up costs this planning effort, given the background knowledge required (e.g. understanding the relationship between mitigation and adaptation). More opportunities for community education as well as feedback will foster public support this work, improve community buy-in, and equitable distribution of project resources moving forward. This climate mitigation and adaptation plan highlighted some of the challenges of integrating mitigation and adaptation co-benefits. The highly quantitative nature of estimating GHG emissions reductions makes it challenging to create parallel links to some of the more qualitative benefits of the adaptation actions. For example, while GHG savings from tree plantings are quantified, this plan does not quantify the specifics reductions in urban heat island affect. With more detailed future studies, these benefits could be more specifically quantified, making the argument for GHG and adaptation co-benefits more robust. Other key lessons learned during the Alameda CARP process include: • When engaging the public, community groups, City commissions and other organizations, it is important to frame the CARP with relevancy by emphasizing elements that are practical and tangible, such as health, food production, and transportation. • It is important to be strategic in messaging “adaptive management.” It can be difficult for citizens to understand the need to focus action on a near-term threshold event (e.g., 36"" sea level rise) when they are predisposed to viewing climate change on a longer-term horizon. © 2020 Bracing for Climate Change: Strategies for Mitigation and Resiliency Planning Conference Proceedings.

The hydro-ecological state of shallow water ecosystems can be influenced by anthropogenic activities (e.g., flow regulation, water abstraction) and climate variability/change. Therefore, they need to be monitored to provide baseline and impact data. In this paper, we capitalize on the water - vegetation interaction to evaluate relative water level variations on wetlands of one of the largest inland freshwater deltas in the world between the years 2012 and 2016 by exploiting RADARSAT-2 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and its differential interferometric configuration (D-InSAR). The influence of different terrain models on the topographic phase correction is also evaluated. Results revealed complex hydrodynamics in the water bodies studied and inferences of environmental processes taking place that modify local landforms and influence water level fluctuations. Comparison between D-InSAR derived water displacements and those measured at specific hydrometric stations indicates overall reliable results. The analysis proposed can be extended to study dynamics of deltaic lakes and wetlands in other areas of the globe. © 2019","D-InSAR; Hydrodynamics; Peace-Athabasca delta; SAR; Wetlands","Ecosystems; Hydrodynamics; Hydrogeology; Motion compensation; Water levels; Wetlands; Anthropogenic activity; D-inSAR; Hydrological monitoring; Interferometric configuration; Peace-athabasca deltas; Shallow water ecosystems; Water level variations; Water-level fluctuation; Synthetic aperture radar; coastal wetland; delta; human activity; hydrodynamics; hydrological modeling; lacustrine environment; latitude; RADARSAT; shallow water; synthetic aperture radar; water level; wetland; Alberta; Athabasca River; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075324003

In the face of concurrent climate change, concerns are growing about the ability of intensively managed agroecosystems to ensure stable food provisioning, as they may be particularly vulnerable to climate extreme-induced harvest losses and pest outbreaks. Extensively managed systems, in contrast, were shown to mitigate climate change based on plant diversity-mediated effects, such as higher functional redundancy or asynchrony of species. In this context, the maintenance of soils is essential to sustain key ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycling, pest control, and crop yield. Within the highly diverse soil fauna, nematodes represent an important group as their trophic spectrum ranges from detritivores to predators and they allow inferences to the overall state of the ecosystem (bioindicators). Here, we investigated the effects of simulated climate change and land-use intensity on the diversity and abundance of soil nematode functional groups and functional indices in two consecutive years. We revealed that especially land use induced complex shifts in the nematode community with strong seasonal dynamics, while future climate led to weaker effects. Strikingly, the high nematode densities associated with altered climatic conditions and intensive land use were a consequence of increased densities of opportunists and potential pest species (i.e., plant feeders). This coincided with a less diverse and less structured community with presumably reduced capabilities to withstand environmental stress. These degraded soil food web conditions represent a potential threat to ecosystem functioning and underline the importance of management practices that preserve belowground organisms. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Agroecosystem management; Belowground diversity; Food security; Food-web complexity; Global change","agricultural ecosystem; climate change; community structure; ecosystem management; food security; food web; functional group; global change; land use change; nematode; soil fauna; species diversity; terrestrial ecosystem; vulnerability; Nematoda; animal; climate change; ecosystem; nematode; plant; soil; Animals; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Nematoda; Plants; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075884459

There is considerable research being done in creating Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs), which focus on examining the human impacts on climate change. Many popular IAMs are created as steady state optimisation models. They typically employ a nested structure of neoclassical production functions to represent the energy-economy system, holding aggregate views on variables, and hence are unable to capture a finer level of details of the underlying system components. An alternative approach that allows modelling populations as a collection of individual and unevenly distributed entities is Agent-Based Modelling, often used in the field of Social Simulation. But simulating huge numbers of individual entities can quickly become an issue, as it requires large amounts of computational resources. The goal of this paper is to introduce a conceptual framework for developing hybrid IAMs. This novel modelling approach allows us to reuse existing rigid, but well-established IAMs, and adds more flexibility by replacing aggregate stocks with a community of vibrant interacting entities. We provide a proof-of-concept of the application of this conceptual framework in form of an illustrative example. Our test case takes the settings of the US. It is solely created for the purpose of demonstrating our hybrid modelling approach; we do not claim that it has predictive powers. © 2020, University of Surrey.

This article provides an exploratory statistical analysis of three adaptation measures (shoreline armoring, property acquisitions, and beach nourishment) and their deployment with respect to metrics of risk exposure, socioeconomic markers, and critical infrastructure in North Carolina (U.S.). This exploratory analysis evaluates two propositions. First, adaptation measures are deployed relative to specific metrics of risk. Second, adaptation choice disproportionately correlates with socioeconomic attributes. The findings support both propositions and reveal that shoreline armoring correlates with higher home values, household incomes, and population density and low racial diversity. Property acquisitions are found to correlate with low home values, household incomes, and population density and high racial diversity. Furthermore, adaptation measures are interconnected. Acquisitions are more likely to occur in areas with low levels of armoring. Beach nourishment occurs exclusively in areas with shoreline armoring. The results find no correlation of adaptation deployment with critical infrastructure. This article provides the foundation for future research into how adaptation decisions are made and trade-offs among adaptation actions considered, whether decisions adequately protect critical infrastructure, and how deployment patterns affect social equity. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Beach nourishment; Climate adaptation; Coastal armoring; Coastal management; Managed retreat; North Carolina","Beaches; Climate change; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Mergers and acquisitions; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Public works; Risk assessment; Risk management; Shore protection; Beach nourishment; Climate adaptation; Coastal armoring; Coastal management; Managed retreat; North Carolina; Critical infrastructures; adaptive management; beach nourishment; climate change; coastal zone management; decision making; population density; shoreline change; socioeconomic conditions; strategic approach; North Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074539411

Therefore, climatic modelers and radiative monitoring require accurate estimates of land surface albedo. With the instrument development, algorithm upgrade, spectral-band-adjustment in wavelength center or band width, and the increasing distinct requirement from diversified communities, various albedo terms have been generated in related satellite-based products. The lack of understanding on the divergence of these terminologies can introduce potential considerable errors in the subsequent applications, or an elevated probability to invert the deduced conclusion. We surveyed the basic concepts of reflectance quantities, retrieval strategies, and models developed since the 1970s, and discuss both strength and opportunity for improvements on land surface albedo extraction, and product generation. In addition, we exemplified the difference of albedo terms using the daily MODIS product (MCD43A) to emphasize the potential risk of the ambiguous usage, over typical IGBP land covers in Northern Kazakhstan. Our investigation shows that relative differences among various albedo terms can reach up to 181% and 50%, while 0.266 and 0.118 of  absolute variance respectively in the narrow and broad-band surface albedo, which illuminated cautions against the ambiguous understanding of albedo terminologies or erroneous usage of albedo products. © 2020 The Author(s).

When it fixes O2, it produces 2-phosphoglycolate, which is detoxified by photorespiration and recycled to the Calvin–Benson–Bassham cycle. To complete photorespiration, metabolite transport across three organelles, chloroplasts, peroxisomes, and mitochondria, is necessary through transmembrane transporters. In rice (Oryza sativa) little is known about photorespiratory transmembrane transporters. Here, we identified the rice plastidic glycolate/glycerate translocator 1 (OsPLGG1), a homolog of Arabidopsis PLGG1. OsPLGG1 mutant lines, osplgg1-1, osplgg1-2, and osplgg1-3, showed a growth retardation phenotype, such as pale green leaf, reduced tiller number, and reduced seed grain weight as well as reduced photosynthetic carbon reduction rate due to low activities of photosystem I and II. The plant growth retardation in osplgg1 mutants was rescued under high CO2 condition. Subcellular localization of OsPLGG1–GFP fusion protein, along with its predicted N-terminal transmembrane domain, confirmed that OsPLGG1 is a chloroplast transmembrane protein. Metabolite analysis indicated significant accumulation of photorespiratory metabolites, especially glycolate and glycerate, which have been shown to be transported by the Arabidopsis PLGG1, and changes for a number of metabolites which are not intermediates of photorespiration in the mutants.

As a special excited species, the hybridized local and charge-transfer (HLCT) excited state is a promising strategy to achieve blue emission and high photoluminescence quantum yield. Herein, a novel donor-acceptor fluorophore, namely 2-phenyl-5-(10-(4-(1,2,2-triphenylvinyl)phenyl)-10H-phenothiazin-3-yl)-1,3,4-oxadia-zole (TPEPO), is designed and synthesized as an efficient blue organic light-emitting diode (BOLED) material. Remarkably, the external quantum efficiencies of the nondoped device with TPEPO as an emitter was as high as 6.62% and radiative exciton ratio was also high, i.e., approximately 36%–55%, indicating that the developed BOLED exhibits the highest efficiency that has been reported so far for a BOLED based on phenothiazine as the donor material. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the relation between the excited state characteristics and electroluminescence properties and a valuable strategy for the design of a new generation of blue chromophores with phenothiazine as the donor. © 2019","Highly efficient; Hybridized local and charge-transfer; Nondoped blue organic light-emitting diodes; Phenothiazine donor","Charge transfer; Chromophores; Efficiency; Electroluminescence; Electronic equipment; Insecticides; Light; Luminescence; Organic light emitting diodes (OLED); Quantum efficiency; Quantum theory; State estimation; Blue electroluminescence; Blue organic light emitting diodes; Charge-transfer excited state; Electroluminescence properties; External quantum efficiency; Highly efficient; Phenothiazine donor; Photoluminescence quantum yields; Excited states; Charge Transfer; Chromophores; Efficiency; Electroluminescence; Electronic Equipment; Insecticides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071968488

Several interferences are yet to be overcome for widespread adoption of EVs, despite many benefits provided to the consumers. The tendencies of customers to resist new technology is one of the major barriers in EV adoption. Hence, the policy-related decisions that showing grim concerns of EV have a greater level of success. This research aims to identify potential environmental and socio-technical barriers to purchase of EVs and it determines if governmental policies and awareness of individuals affect the customer decisions purchasing an EV. This research tries to convey valuable insights into perceptions and preferences of technology enthusiasts, individuals who are greatly connected to latest technology developments, and those who are well equipped to sort out the numerous differences between CVs and EVs. These results can provide direction to EV engineer’s decision in including customer preference into EV engineering design. It can also help policymakers in developing transportation and energy policies. A survey-based study was conducted with a sample of 1230 people from urban cities of emerging Asian markets, i.e. India and Srilanka. The data collected were analyzed, which found perception of economic benefits, functional characteristics of EVs, awareness, knowledge, and familiarity of EVs as significant parameters, which directly have an impact on the purchase behavior of fully EVs. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

Based on a comparative case study of two heavily polluted urban areas around Beijing and Delhi, we find that people's economic welfare and political rights are affected disproportionally not only by toxic air pollutants, but also through various policy interventions, market activities, and social practices designed to reduce or adapt to air pollution. Drawing on the concepts of environmental justice and just transitions, we present an analytical framework for investigating the links between outdoor air pollution and social inequalities. The framework enables a better understanding of structural constraints, political constraints and protective constraints in the context of outdoor air pollution and their impacts on social vulnerabilities with particular relevance to fast industrialising countries.

However, the spatiotemporal pattern of urban forest cover changes related with the dynamics of interior and intact forests from the present to the future have rarely been characterized. We investigated fragmentation of urban forest cover using satellite observations and simulation models in the Nanjing Laoshan Region of Jiangbei New Area, Jiangsu, China, during 2002–2023. Object-oriented classification-based land cover maps were created to simulate land cover changes using the cellular automation-Markov chain (CA-Markov) model and the state transition simulation modeling. We then quantified the forest cover change by the morphological change detection algorithm and estimated the forest area density-based fragmentation patterns. Their relationships were built through the spatial analysis and statistical methods. Results showed that the overall accuracies of actual land cover maps were approximately 83.75–92.25% (2012–2017). The usefulness of a CA-Markov model for simulating land cover maps was demonstrated. The greatest proportion of forest with a low level of fragmentation was captured along with the decreasing percentage of fragmented area from 81.1% to 64.1% based on high spatial resolution data with the window size of 27 pixels × 27 pixels. The greatest increase in fragmentation (3% from 2016 to 2023) among the changes between intact and fragmented forest was reported. However, intact forest was modeled to have recovered in 2023 and restored to 2002 fragmentation levels. Moreover, we found 58.07 km2 and 0.35 km2 of interior and intact forests have been removed from forest area losses and added from forest area gains. The loss rate of forest interior and intact area exceeded the rate of total forest area loss. However, their approximate ratio (1) implying the loss of forest interior and intact area would have slight fragmentation effects on the remaining forests. This analysis illustrates the achievement of protecting and restoring forest interior; more importantly, excessive human activities in the surrounding area had been avoided. This study provides strategies for future forest conservation and management in large urban regions. © 2020 by the authors.

In this study, we conducted offline VOC measurements at residential, industrial, and background sites in Wuhan City from July 2016 to June 2017. Ambient samples were simultaneously collected at each site and were analyzed using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry/flame ionization detection system. The highest mixing ratio of total VOCs was measured at the industrial site, followed by the residential, and background sites. Alkanes constituted the largest percentage (>35%) in the mixing ratios of quantified VOCs at the industrial and residential sites, followed by oxy-organics and alkenes (15-25%).The values of aromatics and halohydrocarbons were less than 15%. By contrast, the highest values of oxy-organics accounted for more than 30%. The model of positive matrix factorization was applied to identify the VOC sources and quantify the relative contributions of various sources. Gasoline-related emission (the combination of gasoline exhaust and gas vapor) was the most important VOC-source in the industrial and residential areas, with a relative contribution of 32.1% and 40.4%, respectively. Industrial process was the second most important source with a relative contribution ranging from 30.0% to 40.7%. The relative contribution of solvent usage was 6.5-22.3%. Meanwhile, the relative contribution of biogenic emission was only within the range of 2.0-5.0%. These findings implied the importance of controlling gasoline-related and industrial VOC emissions in reducing the VOC emissions in Wuhan.","PMF; source apportionment; VOCs; Wuhan","ozone; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; China; city; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; spatiotemporal analysis; Air Pollutants; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Ozone; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Vehicle Emissions; Volatile Organic Compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078951473

The generated future climate data combined with comfort model assessment has been proposed as a new way including future climate scenarios in preliminary building design for two representative sites, in Rome, Italy and Stockholm, Sweden. The existing vulnerability to the expected climate conditions from psychometric analysis indicates that: (1) the climate trend in Rome would gradually lead to more failures in the majority of conventional adaptive design measures, as the cooling and dehumidification demands would rise from 5.3% to 23.6%, while the heating and humidification demands would decrease from 27% to 16%; (2) the climate trend in Stockholm would result in an increased comfort period by exploiting more adaptive design measures, since the heating and humidification demands would be reduced from 67% to 53%. However, the cooling and dehumidification demands would increase slightly from 0% to 1.5%. Accordingly, four main key risks are identified: 1) overheating would become a rising increasing public health threat for buildings in Rome that rely exclusively on natural ventilation; 2) open questions remain for the design team in the area of correct cooling load selection, additional space for the future installation and the effectiveness of current cooling device etc.; 3) occasional heat waves and gradual rising humidity levels are expected to be a vulnerable topic for conventional lightweight building in Stockholm; 4) buildings with a heavy heating load would tend to have greater cooling demand, especially those with poor ventilation resources or greater internal gains. In conclusion, it is suggested that envelope optimization, whichever climate type, is one of the most efficient and effective adaptation measures towards future climate conditions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate adaptive building design; Climate change; Psychrometric analysis; Thermal comfort model; Weather data morphing","Architectural design; Climate change; Health risks; Humidity control; Public risks; Structural design; Thermal comfort; Ventilation; Building design; Future climate scenarios; Morphing; Natural ventilation; Psychometric analysis; Psychrometric analysis; Stockholm , Sweden; Thermal comfort models; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073097183

In this study, changes of the 7-day low flow along the most important rivers of Iran’s Namak Lake Basin were investigated using nonparametric (Mann-Kendall and modified-Mann-Kendall) tests. A significant diminishing trend was observed in 72.2% of stations during the period of 1970–2012. The northern part of the basin lacked a significant trend, while in other parts of the basin, the descending trend was distributed uniformly. On the other hand, the changes of the annual rainfall during this period showed no clear trend (a significant trend in 36% and non-significant trend in 64% of stations), and the identified pattern of its changes was complicated on the basin scale and during the year. On a monthly scale, a significant decreasing trend was observed in March as one of the most productive months of the year in 49% of the stations. In addition, rainfall reduction was significant (over 35%) over the past 15 years in more than 71% of the stations. Also, changes in the proportion of seasonal rainfall and rainfall regime were considerable. The share of winter and spring rainfall showed a diminishing trend in 90% and 82% of stations, respectively. Also, rainfall regime based on precipitation concentration index (PCI) revealed a tendency to disorder (in 53% of stations). The annual temperature and temperature of October and February indicated a strong ascending trend in 92%, 71S%, and 64% of stations, respectively, which can be effective during snow melting in basins with snow-rainy regimes and increasing evapotranspiration. Groundwater level changes also showed that, in the studied plains, the average water table drawdown was between 0.31 and 1.33 m/year. Therefore, the observed trend of low flow rates in this basin reflects the impact of climate change, where both direct and indirect human interference has led to the exacerbation of this situation. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate change; climate effect; human activity; hydrological response; precipitation assessment; rainfall; spatiotemporal analysis; trend analysis; Iran; Namak Lake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069685082

Biofuels, as an alternative to fossil fuels, not only ensure energy security but also mitigate air pollution and reduce greenhouse emissions. Biofuels can be produced from sugar- and starch-rich food crops (first-generation biofuel) or lignocellulosic biomass (second-generation biofuel). However, the overexploitation of conventional lignocellulosic sources such as agro-industrial residues, dedicated herbaceous, hardwoods and softwoods and forest residues may lead to problems in terms of land management and biodiversity conservation. Non-conventional sources include industrial cellulosic waste, municipal solid waste and weeds. Of these, weeds are an attractive lignocellulosic source due to their prevalence and easy availability. Eichhornia crassipes, commonly known as water hyacinth, is one of the world’s most invasive weeds due to its rapid proliferation rate, efficient survival strategies in extreme conditions, and it has a significant impact on the environment, ecological communities, human health and socioeconomic development. Strategies including physical removal, chemical methods and biological control agents have proven inefficient in completely eradicating Eichhornia crassipes. On the other hand, water hyacinth has a low lignin and high holocellulose content and is a rich source of lignocellulosic biomass, and has therefore been exploited as a raw material for the production of biofuel, biogas, animal and fish feed, compost and other valuable products.

We collaborated with smallholder coffee cooperatives in Latin America to assess the feasibility of climate change resilience strategies they selected: crop diversification; rainwater collection systems; pest monitoring and management; collective coffee seed banks and nurseries; and solar coffee dryers. Data was collected through key actor and cooperative leader semi-structured interviews and focus groups with cooperative members. Our results provide criteria that can be used to determine if these five resilience strategies are appropriate for given environmental, socioeconomic, and political contexts. They also demonstrate the need for tailoring resilience strategies to fit local conditions. The framework we applied serves to select appropriate, effective and equitable resilience strategies, combining a participatory action research approach to incorporate local knowledge, capital assets analysis for a holistic and realistic understanding of feasibility, and access analysis for an assessment of who will benefit and who will not.

Numerous empirical studies of the past two decades have identified the politicization of this issue. In recent years, the concurrence of rising extreme weather events and uptick in public concern for climate change has led to common speculation that the former may drive up the latter. Using a nationally representative survey dataset combined with climate extremes data including extreme heat, extreme precipitation, and mild drought or worse, we use Structural Equation Modeling to examine how politics and climate extremes altogether shape American public concern for climate change. In addition to confirming politicization of climate change, we find that approval of President Trump not only promotes skeptical climate change perceptions but also serves as an intervening amplifier of these perceptions for Republicans and conservatives. Thus, one’s concern for climate change is partially explained by their political identification and partially explained by their levels of approval of Trump. With the 2020 presidential election underway, it remains to be seen how attitudes towards presidential candidates can affect climate change perceptions and support for climate policies. The widely speculated role of climate extremes however fails to show significant effects in views towards climate change. We provide explanations for this insignificant finding. The study ends by calling for more studies to further investigate the drivers of formation of opinions towards climate change. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Approval of Trump; Climate extremes; Concern for climate change; Structural Equation Modeling","Digital storage; Precipitation (meteorology); Approval of Trump; Change perceptions; Climate extremes; Extreme precipitation; Extreme weather events; Presidential candidates; Presidential election; Structural equation modeling; Climate change; climate change; data set; election; empirical analysis; extreme event; numerical model; perception; political system; precipitation (climatology); United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076789997

Carsharing and zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) could be integral to creating a more sustainable transportation system. This paper presents the results of a study that evaluated the impacts of ZEV exposure on U.S. carsharing users. Surveys were administered to control and experimental groups of carsharing members that used shared plug-in electric vehicles (PHEVs) or electric vehicles (EVs). Results showed that users who drove shared PHEVs or EVs more frequently were more likely to exhibit improved ZEV opinions. The population of respondents that used shared EVs and PHEVs were also more likely to recommend that others try driving a ZEV. The results suggest that exposure to PHEVs or EVs through carsharing increased a user's reported likeliness to purchase a ZEV in the future. The experimental group, who employed shared PHEVs or EVs, was more likely to indicate that their next vehicle purchase will be a PHEV or EV than the control group. Collectively, the results suggest that temporary exposure to ZEVs through carsharing improves perceptions that may lead to an expanded ZEV market share. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carsharing; Electric vehicles (EVs); Market barriers; Plug-in electric vehicles (PHEVs); Purchasing behavior; Zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs)","car ownership; electric vehicle; perception; transportation development; transportation planning; transportation policy; transportation system; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073028806

How green roofs can help reduce carbon emissions in urban areas, directly and indirectly, is the focus of this review, which draws on recently published studies. The direct impact of green roofs on carbon sequestration involves vegetation and soil media, which can capture and store air pollutants on a building scale. The indirect impact includes the long-term green roof effect, which can include reducing building energy consumption, leading to a reduction in fossil fuel consumption. Consequently, this process could reduce CO2 emissions around the globe. According to the literature analysis, the indirect long-term benefits help promote green roofs as a green practice around the world. It was found that vegetation and soil properties are the key factors affecting the performance of building energy consumption reduction and CO2 sequestration. Stakeholders and the public are encouraged, based on the literature review results, to adopt green roofs in building construction projects as a climate mitigation strategy. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Carbon emission reduction; Carbon sequestration; Direct impact; Green roofs (GRs); Indirect impact","atmospheric pollution; building construction; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; emission control; literature review; pollution effect; roof; urban area",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075566583

Integrated Waste Management Facility is called as Tempat Pembuangan Sampah Terpadu in Indonesian, and abbreviated as TPST Piyungan. Both CH4 and CO2 gasses are potential to trigger climate change. Therefore, local institutions are required to intensify efforts towards preventing the harmful effect on climate change. This study aimed to determine the involvement of local institutions in handling waste problems in the TPST as one of the strategies to mitigate climate change. A qualitative approach was used to identify three factors of climate resilience including urban systems (infrastructure), social agents (stakeholders), and local institutions while quantitative scoring methods were used, based on the recommendations from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), to determine the waste management strategies. The results showed the Integrated Waste Management Facility in Piyungan has not been able to reduce CH4 emissions. The urban systems or infrastructure of the facility were found to be in a moderate while the social agents or stakeholders and local institutions were in a good category. However, the participation of local institutions has a major influence on climate change mitigation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; Waste management; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Influence on climate; Integrated waste management; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Local institutions; Qualitative approach; Quantitative scoring; Waste management strategies; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081108576

Common reed wetlands are particularly interesting given their high productivity, abundance, and highly efficient internal gas-transport mechanism. However, little is known about the interannual behavior and dominant controlling factors of Mediterranean reed wetlands, characterized by seasonal flooding and remarkable weather variability. After six years of ecosystem carbon and ET flux measurements by eddy covariance (three years for CH4 fluxes), this study shows the functional vulnerability of such wetlands to climate variability, switching between carbon (CO2 + CH4) sink (660 g CO2-eq m−2 yr−1, in 2014) and source (360 g CO2-eq m−2 yr−1, in 2016) in short periods of time. According to our analyses, the great interannual variability appeared to mainly depend on the behavior of reed growth dynamics during the transition to senescence period, what is confirmed through the enhanced vegetation index as a proxy of photosynthetic activity. Additionally, a similar behavior of seasonal and daily patterns of carbon fluxes and ET was found compared with other wetlands under different climates. ©2019. American Geophysical Union.

Social innovation (SI) in local energy transitions have been scrutinized in multiple works, but the impact of SI on the local energy transitions is an under-studied field. The objective of this study is to put forward a method to model SI in local energy transitions. This is done using System Dynamics modelling (SDM) of the local energy transitions processes. The SDM method is to study a broad spectrum of socio-techno-natural phenomena, generally. In this study, SDM is used to capture the endogenous factors which underpin the transition processes. This study is based on two cases: solar photovoltaics (PV) diffusion in Skåne, and transition to alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) in Dalsland, Sweden. The transitions are modelled with the municipality actors providing input. Two simulation runs of the local transitions are executed, namely the Base run and No SI run. The Base run has the municipality actors’ co-creation actions. Results show that the co-creation actions induce a significant increase in the diffusion of electric vehicles in Dalsland and higher diffusion of solar PV in Skåne. The main outcome of this study is a model to assess the possible impacts of SI on local energy transitions. Ultimately, we hope to contribute to methods of quantitatively assessing the impact of SI in local energy transitions. © 2020 The Authors","Co-creation; Energy transitions; Simulation; Social innovation; System dynamics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100652966

In this chapter, we explore how these differences between home and host countries of international business groups explain carbon emissions at the affiliate level. Using an extensive dataset of business groups with facilities covered by the EU-ETS, we find evidence of intragroup regulatory arbitrage (RA) in that affiliates with foreign parent companies show significantly higher carbon emissions compared to domestically owned affiliates. Moreover, stringency of the host country’s implementation of EU-ETS only reduces affiliates’ emissions for domestically owned affiliates while stringent implementation at parent level seems to exacerbate carbon emissions at affiliate level. However, this RA-behavior is strongly influenced by the affiliate’s carbon allowances.

According to studies, KET is associated to direct neutorotoxic damages due to its capacity to induce oxidative stress. Because of the free radical generation in the organism and its relation with diseases’ development, there is a growing interest to study antioxidant molecules, such as gallic acid (GA), a natural phenolic compound. Aim: Evaluate the GA antioxidant potential for the prevention of oxidative damage in the brain and liver tissue of rats exposed to acute KET administration. Material and Methods: 32 Wistar male rats received GA (by gavage, 13.5 mg/kg) for three consecutive days, 24 h after the last GA dose, animals were anesthetized with KET (50 mg/kg, i.m.). All animals were euthanized by decapitation 60 min after KET administration. The liver, brain cortex and hippocampus were removed and homogenized for biochemical analysis. Results: In brain cortex, KET increased reactive species (RS) generation, protein carbonyls (PC) levels and reduced non-protein thiols (NPSH) levels, while GA pre-treatment reduced PC and increased NPSH levels. KET increased PC and decreased NPSH levels in the hippocampus, and GA reduced PC and NPSH levels. In the liver, no difference was observed in the RS generation, while KET induced and increase of PC levels and decreased NPSH levels, while GA pre-treatment prevented it. Conclusion: GA administration can prevent oxidative damage caused by acute KET administration and minimize its noxious effects. Further studies are needed to evidence GA antioxidant properties regarding KET chronic use. © 2019","Anesthetic; Antioxidant compound; Oxidative stress","carbonyl derivative; gallic acid; glutathione; ketamine; malonaldehyde; non protein thiol; protein; superoxide dismutase; unclassified drug; anesthetic agent; gallic acid; ketamine; reactive oxygen metabolite; thiobarbituric acid reactive substance; thiol derivative; animal experiment; antioxidant activity; Article; brain biochemistry; brain cortex; brain region; controlled study; hippocampus; lipid membrane; lipid peroxidation; liver tissue; male; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; rat; animal; brain; drug effect; liver; metabolism; oxidative stress; protein carbonylation; Wistar rat; Anesthetics, Dissociative; Animals; Brain; Cerebral Cortex; Gallic Acid; Hippocampus; Ketamine; Lipid Peroxidation; Liver; Male; Oxidative Stress; Protein Carbonylation; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Reactive Oxygen Species; Sulfhydryl Compounds; Thiobarbituric Acid Reactive Substances",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074169754

Decarbonizing the electric sector is one of the most cost-effective ways to reduce emissions and can help decarbonize other sectors with increased electrification. While renewable energy and energy efficiency have grown significantly in recent years due to technology cost reductions, state policies, and federal tax incentives, our rate of emissions reduction does not go far enough. Our analysis shows that a well-designed national Low Carbon Electricity Standard (LCES), Renewable Electricity Standard (RES), or increasing carbon price can help get the U.S. on a pathway for decarbonizing the power sector by 2050. The most cost-effective strategy for reducing emissions in the near-term is through the increased deployment of wind and solar, regardless of the policy. How much the generation mix shifts to low-carbon resources is a function of the stringency of the policy. These policies can also spur the development of low-carbon electricity in parts of the country that are not as far along in their transition to a clean energy economy. Allowing a wide range of carbon-free and low-carbon resources to compete against each other could deliver the most low-carbon electricity at the lowest cost and help broaden support for these policies. © 2019","Carbon pricing; Climate change; Coal plant retirements; Electricity modeling; Low carbon electricity standards; Public health",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077662770

The study employed an autoregressive distributed lag technique, statistically inspired modification of partial least squares regression and Utest method to analyze four models with data spanning 1971 to 2013. Both the autoregressive distributed lag model and the Utest estimation confirmed an inverted u-shaped curve, thus, validating the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis in Kenya. The study revealed that an increase in energy consumption exacerbates carbon dioxide emissions in the long-run. The statistically inspired modification of partial least squares regression revealed that electricity from renewable energy sources plays a critical role in carbon dioxide emission reduction. An increase in GDP per capita and household consumption expenditure increases energy consumption. Energy imports had no long-run effect due to the recent oil discovery, coal, prospects of nuclear energy and the potential for more renewable energy sources in Kenya. The study highlights that using sustainable technologies like, inter alia, carbon capture and storage in the exploitation of oil and coal are essential to reducing pollution. Rural-urban migration increases the burden on electric power consumption, thus, reducing energy efficiency if conservation options are not enforced. As a policy implication, engaging the public on energy conservation and management options will help curb energy challenges like load shedding — which appears troubling in Africa. © Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide emissions; EKC hypothesis; Energy consumption; Kenya","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal storage; Digital storage; Economics; Electric load shedding; Electric utilities; Emission control; Energy utilization; Global warming; Least squares approximations; Multivariant analysis; Petroleum prospecting; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Autoregressive distributed lag models; Carbon dioxide emissions; EKC hypothesis; Electric power consumption; Environmental kuznets curve hypothesis; Environmental Kuznets curves; Kenya; Partial least squares regression; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073547753

However, its continued use is becoming less sustainable given the high CO2 emissions associated with its manufacture. Alkali-activated cements are considered to be viable low carbon alternative binders, which use industrial waste products such as blast furnace slag. This study focusses on the stabilisation of a potentially liquefiable soft alluvial soil using a dry granulated binder comprising sodium hydroxide-activated blast furnace slag (GGBS-NaOH). This binder has previously been demonstrated by the authors to have potential as a replacement for Portland cement due to its excellent engineering performance, positive contributions towards the circular economy, reducing energy usage and CO2 emissions in the construction sector. A detailed comparison in mechanical behaviour is presented between the soil in its reconstituted, undisturbed and cemented states after 28 days curing through the use of advanced monotonic triaxial testing techniques, including small strain measurements. Mechanical behaviour was specifically analysed regarding peak deviatoric strength, pore pressure response, stress – volumetric dilatancy, shear stiffness degradation over small to large strain ranges, critical state and failure surfaces. Using 7.5% GGBS-NaOH increased the stiffness and shear strength of the soil significantly, whereby the shear strains at which initial shear stiffness degrades is three times higher than the untreated undisturbed soil. As a result, larger amounts of dilation was observed during shearing of the material and resulted in an upward shift of the soil's original critical state line due to the creation of an artificially cemented soil matrix through the precipitation of C-(N)-A-S-H gels. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Alluvium; GGBS; Low carbon; Mechanical behaviour; Stiffness degradation; Triaxial","Binders; Blast furnaces; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Construction industry; Critical current density (superconductivity); Energy utilization; Portland cement; Slags; Sodium hydroxide; Soil cement; Soil testing; Soils; Stiffness; Strain; Alluvium; GGBS; Low carbon; Mechanical behaviour; Stiffness degradation; Triaxial; Shear strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073589619

Unclear accountability for translocal connections renders these initiatives at risk of locking unsustainable practices into transitions. Seeking clarity, this paper examines accountability through the lenses of material dislocation and discursive construction in an assessment of Oslo’s (2019) and Lisbon’s (2020) winning EGC entries. How can the EGC distinction better enable substantive urban sustainability, situating claims within wider energy transitions in these capital regions? Within the award’s circumscribed focus on urban centres, do cities account for cognitive and material dislocation through their discursive emphases and telecoupling respectively? Does the EGC catalyse change, brand the capture of low-hanging fruit, or spatially dislocate rather than reduce emissions? We argue that it propagates a focus on optimizing local sustainability effects, while rarely accounting for larger translocal or cross-scalar repercussions. Hence, urban sustainability strategies risk spatially dislocating socio-ecologically unsustainable practices rather than decreasing emissions systemically. Cities need to institute accountability mechanisms that reshape the geographies of responsibility for the systemic and translocal impacts of urban sustainability initiatives, which the EGC could promote by, e.g. including emission indicators for consumption and aviation. © 2019, © 2019 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography.","Accountability; discourse; European green capitals; materiality; telecoupling; urban sustainability transitions","accountability; capital flow; econometrics; governance approach; numerical model; sustainability; urban economy; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Norway; Oslo [Norway]; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073836010

We initially obtain a non-isothermal DEM distribution with a dominant component centered around 0.9 MK and a secondary smaller component at 1.5 – 2.0 MK. We find that deconvolving the data with the instrument point spread function (PSF) to account for long-range scattered light reduces the secondary hot component. Using the 2012 Venus transit and a 2013 lunar eclipse to test the efficiency of this deconvolution, significant amounts of residual stray light are found for the occulted areas. Accounting for this stray light in the error budget of the different AIA filters further reduces the secondary hot emission, yielding CH DEM distributions that are close to isothermal with the main contribution centered around 0.9 MK. Based on these DEMs, we analyze the evolution of the emission measure (EM), density, and averaged temperature during the CH’s lifetime. We find that once the CH is clearly observed in EUV images, the bulk of the CH plasma reveals a quite constant state, i.e. temperature and density reveal no major changes, whereas the total CH area and the photospheric magnetic fine structure inside the CH show a distinct evolutionary pattern. These findings suggest that CH plasma properties are mostly “set” at the CH formation or/and that all CHs have similar plasma properties. © 2020, The Author(s).","Corona; Coronal holes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077718576

The carbon sequestered and stored in coastal habitat including mangroves, salt marshes, and seagrass beds is termed as blue carbon. However, these systems are threatened mainly due to sea level rise, limited sediment supply, edge erosion, and anthropogenic influences. These habitats require restoration and conservation to continue providing ecosystem services. The incentive for emission reductions, referred to as carbon offsets, is well established for other ecosystems like forestry and agriculture. Some blue carbon offset methodologies or protocols have been certified by various voluntary carbon markets; however to date, a few wetland restoration carbon offset in the US has been transacted. Thus, the goal of this paper is to discuss the existing carbon market and carbon market methodologies applicable to coastal wetland restoration and conservation in the US. Currently, four wetland carbon offset methodologies have been approved in the carbon market. These methodologies are site and/or project-specific depending on the type of the wetlands, vulnerability to loss, and restoration need. The appropriate carbon stock and Green House Gas (GHG) emission assessment is the basis of determining carbon offsets. Simplification of the existing methodologies and development of new site and project-specific methodologies could potentially help to realize blue carbon offsets in practice.

We found a remarkable rise in the incidence of transmissible infectious disease symptoms after Hurricane Alex. Gastrointestinal symptoms predominated and were associated with drinking water probably because of the contamination of clean water, the disruption of water sanitation, and the inability to maintain home hygiene practices. According to data from the “Centro Nacional de Vigilancia Epidemiológica y Control de Enfermedades”, the trend of rising temperatures and rainfall in the State of Nuevo Leon correlates positively with a rise in infections due to salmonellosis (50%), shigellosis (39%), typhoid fever (42%) and dengue (19%). Such epidemics after catastrophic events can be attributed to multiple factors including changes in human behavior, local climate, local biota and the availability of necessary human resources. All of these factors might alter the protective measures that normally prevent disease. Some of the affected people will gather in shelters with more abundant contagious pathogens, live with more stress and with less mobility. Common routes of transmission include the: respiratory-route, dermal-route, blood-borne diseases, and fecal-oral route. Some epidemics can lag after the event, such as with malaria, which can be seen with a lag time of 6-8 weeks after a flood.14 In 2000, a flood in Mozambique15 showed a 2-4 fold increase in the incidence of water-borne diseases. Our telephone survey data showed a similar 3.8 fold increase in the incidence of human infectious diseases after Hurricane Alex. Respiratory diseases are also associated with climate change. In 2010, the US-Mexican border region reported 387.3 cases per 100,000 inhabitants16 - an impressive 98.1% rise in the preceding 5-year period. This large increase in number of reported disease cases may be related to improvements in diagnostic capabilities in local facilities, but were likely also related to increases in pollution, pollen production, and climate change. Deterioration of normal preventive and hygienic measures, provoked by the flood, wind burst, and normal living practice might increase the possibilities to drink polluted water, decayed food, had less medical or pharmacological access and more contact with people with contagious disease. Greenhouse gases can contribute to air pollution. For example, naturally produced and manmade CO2 pollution is associated with an increase in pollen production. CO2 can function as a plant fertilizer, thereby promoting its growth, which along with the increase in global temperatures might also promote an increase in pollen producing plants and extend their growing period.17 Early and more prolonged exposures to pollen and other air pollutants might explain the rising trends of asthma.18 Hurricane Alex related flooding in Monterrey city produced substantial damage: 6 deaths attributable to food, more than 15,000 internally displaced persons, a substantial increase in disease rates, job absenteeism of greater than 50%, and an estimated economic loses of 1,296 million dollars. Due to the increasing risks associated with global climate change, including more frequent and more serious meteorological conditions that increase the risk of severe flooding, governments are obligated to produce better early warning systems, and new and better disaster readiness plans (including preparedness for more timely interventions that can prevent the early spread of diseases and more economic resources for the timely repair of damages.) Despite some progress of late, contingency countermeasures in our city will still need to improve in order to reduce the risks associated with flooding in different areas of the city. In 400 years of Monterrey’s history, we have had 19 floods; two per century in the first three centuries, seven in the twentieth Century, and another two in the first 10 year of our current century. Floods are a relative frequent event in the Monterrey metropolitan area, should be expected to become even more frequent as the climate changes. Public policy has a strong role to play in developing countermeasures that can address human health and human infrastructure damages, and reduce the risk to the larger population. This can be achieved by improving the levies in the Santa Catarina river bank, modernizing the municipal sewage and waste disposal systems, and the more timely provision of clean water and other needed services to the affected population. © 2020 Bracing for Climate Change: Strategies for Mitigation and Resiliency Planning Conference Proceedings.

Traditionally, data on building materials use, energy expenditure in their sourcing and processing, and carbon dioxide equivalent generated are lacking in developing countries. The focus of this report, being part of an ongoing study is that direct impact on environment occurs at various stages in the building material usage especially at the extraction and production stages for which energy is expended. Environmental products such as soil, water and timber which are the main carbon sequesters are exploited during the manufacture / or processing of dominant building technologies in Migori thus affecting carbon sequestration potential of the natural ecosystems. The awareness levels amongst the population on energy and resource efficiency in building construction is grossly limited. The Geographical Information System (GIS) on spatial analysis of proximity and neighbourhood tools demonstrated the emerging patterns in terms of soil, water and forest/grass disturbances resulting from the activities of building construction. The ultimate goal is to facilitate formulation of energy efficiency building codes, green building guidelines, improvement of climate change strategy and Action Plan towards Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) enhancement as well as improve knowledge in the relationship between climate change, building and ecosystem linkages between soil, water and forest cover. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Building Technologies; Carbon Sequestration; Climate Change; Energy Efficiency","Building codes; Building materials; Buildings; Carbon dioxide; Construction; Developing countries; Ecosystems; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; Forestry; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Information use; Population statistics; Processing; Soils; Sustainable development; Building construction; Building technologies; Carbon sequestration; Carbon sequestration potential; Environmental products; Materials and products; Natural environments; Resource efficiencies; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079596734

In subarctic birch forests (Betula pubescens), ecosystem C cycling is largely affected by recurrent outbreaks of defoliating geometrid moths (Epirrita autumnata, Operophtera brumata). Here, we show that soil C stocks in birch forests across Fennoscandia did not change up to 8 years after moth outbreaks. We found that a decrease in woody fine roots was accompanied by a lower soil CO2 efflux rate and a higher soil N availability following moth outbreaks. We suggest that a high N availability and less ectomycorrhiza likely contributed to lowered heterotrophic respiration and soil enzymatic activity. Based on proxies for decomposition (heterotrophic respiration, phenol oxidase potential activity), we conclude that a decrease in decomposition is a prime cause why soil C stocks of mountain birch forest ecosystems have not changed after moth outbreaks. Compared to disturbed temperate and boreal forests, a CO2-related positive feedback of forest disturbance on climate change might therefore be smaller in subarctic regions. © 2019, The Author(s).","Betula pubescens; disturbed subarctic forests; Epirrita autumnata; heterotrophic soil respiration; Operophtera brumata; root biomass; soil carbon sequestration; soil CO2 efflux; soil enzyme activity; structural equation modelling","carbon sequestration; carbon storage; climate change; coniferous forest; decomposition; disturbance; ecological modeling; ectomycorrhiza; enzyme; enzyme activity; forest soil; montane forest; mortality; root system; soil carbon; soil respiration; Fennoscandia; Betula pubescens; Betula pubescens subsp. tortuosa; Epirrita autumnata; Geometridae; Hexapoda; Lepidoptera; Operophtera brumata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065981887

Fossil fuel combustion for heating of individual households is mainly responsible for high air pollution levels in urban areas during winter season as reported by Junninen et al. (Environ Sci Technol 43:7964–7970, 2009). Elemental concentrations were determined by energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence method, whereas ion concentrations were measured by ion chromatography. In addition, concentrations of elemental carbon (EC) and organic carbon (OC) were determined using OC/EC analyzer. Some elements like Br, Pb and Cl−, NO3 −, NH4 + ions show significantly higher concentrations during winter, whereas in summer, higher Ca concentration was observed. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) receptor method was used for identification of air pollution sources and evaluation of their contribution to PM2.5 burden in the local atmosphere. Selected chemical species were used as indicators of particular sources of air pollution. Four source categories were identified through PMF analysis: (i) combustion, (ii) secondary aerosols, (iii) soil/industry/traffic, and (iv) biomass burning. For days with high PM2.5 concentrations (winter season), the contribution of combustion sometimes reaching 55% of PM2.5 mass was identified, whereas for days with low PM2.5 concentrations, it was reduced to approximately 28%. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","EC/OC analysis; Elemental analysis; Ions analysis; PM2.5; Positive matrix factorization","chemical composition; particulate matter; seasonal variation; urban area; Cracow; Malopolskie; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075863770

(common laurel), for reducing peak CO2 concentrations in an air-tight museum environment, namely the Refectory of the Santa Maria delle Grazie Church (Milan, Italy), home of Leonardo da Vinci's painting ""Last Supper"". The phytoremediation potential of laurel plants was evaluated at CO2 ≅ 1000 ppm under controlled environmental conditions. Furthermore, light-saturated net assimilation (Pnmax) was measured at two CO2 concentrations (380 and 1000 ppm) during the growing season. Steady-state gas exchanges were not affected by elevated CO2 in the short-term, while Pnmax was significantly increased, also showing higher values in spring and autumn, and a reduction during summer. Our estimated CO2 removal rates indicate that, in order to control visitors' respiratory CO2 emissions in view of an increase in visitor numbers in the Refectory, a possible NBS in the form of an external greenhouse, connected to the HVAC system of the museum, should allocate from 58 to 112 young laurel plants, depending on their seasonal phytoremediation capacity. These results, although preliminary, allow to hypothesize the possibility of controlling CO2 indoors through a combination of traditional air-cleaning systems and a properly designed NBS, thus increasing the sustainability of air-tight museum environments. © 2020 by the authors.","Gas exchanges; HVAC; Indoor air quality; Laurus nobilis; Light-saturated net photosynthesis; Museum environment; Nature-based solutions; Phytoremediation; Potted plants","air quality; carbon dioxide; environmental conditions; gas exchange; indoor air; phytoremediation; shrub; Milan [Milano]; Laurus nobilis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078846830

So, there is a need to find out a renewable energy source for the transportation system, which makes the environment clean and green. This paper proposes a model of an electric vehicle which utilises the maximum energy from the sun and capable of charging their batteries while on parking or mobility. This proposed solar-based electric bus is equipped with 2520W flexible solar panel while on mobility, but also the 1440W flexible solar panel will be cover the windscreen and all the four windows of the solar electric vehicle while on the parking state. In this manner, the proposed solar electric vehicle will be charged more quickly by covering the maximum area by the flexible solar panel. The Matlab/Simulink model presented that by using the flexible solar panels, particularly at the parking, it provided extra charging to the battery and increasing its range up to several kilometres. Moreover, using this proposed solar-powered electric bus will reduce CO2 emission up to 5389.40 kg and saving the state grid power energy of 359.42 KWh per month. © 2020 IEEE.",,"Carbon dioxide; Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Fossil fuels; MATLAB; Secondary batteries; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; Clean environment; Flexible solar panels; Matlab/Simulink modeling; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Solar electric vehicles; Solar-powered; Transportation system; Vehicle-to-grid",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084684030

This paper presents the analysis and results of the performance and optimization of a stand-alone solar PV power system with single-axis (horizontal and vertical) and dual-axis solar trackers and a diesel generator (DG) for the city of Khorfakkan, Sharjah. The modeling, simulations, and optimization analysis of the hybrid energy system (HES) were performed with the HOMER software based on the daily energy consumption of 37.75 MWh in the study area. The simulation results show that employing an HES with dual-axis solar trackers is the best power system architecture considering the renewable fraction (48.55%) and levelized cost of energy (LCOE; 0.25 $/kWh). The proposed HES meets the annual energy demand of the city (13,778 MWh) without shortages and with an electricity excess of 9.81%. In addition, the sensitivity analysis shows that the HES with dual-axis solar PV tracking system provides lower electricity costs (250 $/MWh) and the highest GHG emission reduction (69.6%, which is equivalent to the GHG emission reduction of a diesel engine consuming 682,279 gallons of diesel fuel). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Diesel; Hybrid energy system; Optimization; Renewable energy; Sensitivity analysis; Single-axis and dual-axis tracking system; Solar PV","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Diesel engines; Emission control; Energy management; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Optimization; Sensitivity analysis; Tracking (position); Diesel; Dual axis; Hybrid energy system; Renewable energies; Solar PVs; Geothermal energy; alternative energy; cost analysis; demand analysis; diesel engine; greenhouse gas; optimization; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; sensitivity analysis; tracking; Sharjah [United Arab Emirates]; United Arab Emirates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075483483

Projecting the spatial distribution and impacts of these risks requires consideration of biophysical and socioeconomic factors. Models like the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) can project spatial distributions of hydrologic risk due to shifting biophysical factors like climate and land use, but cannot account for socioeconomic factors influencing a community’s capacity to adapt to future streamflow changes. To address this limitation, we used a risk matrix to classify subbasins in a large river basin in the southeastern USA based on (1) percent increase in SWAT simulated 10-year and extreme high flows due to climate and land use change between baseline (1982–2002) and projected (2050–2070) periods and (2) degree of community vulnerability according to a Social Vulnerability Index (SVI). We compared spatial distributions of high-risk subbasins based on SWAT results, SVI results, and the integration of SWAT and SVI results using a risk matrix. Large increases in simulated 10-year and extreme high flows occurred in middle and lower parts of the river basin, and socially vulnerable communities were distributed throughout. We identified 16, 7, and 14 unique high-risk subbasins using SWAT results, SVI results, and SWAT and SVI results, respectively. By using a risk matrix, we identified subbasins with vulnerable communities that are projected to experience future increases in streamflow due to climate and land use change. These results serve as a starting point for subsequent climate change adaptation planning. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature (This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply).","adaptation planning; climate change; land use change; social vulnerability; soil water assessment tool; water resources","adaptive management; climate change; land use change; risk assessment; river basin; soil and water assessment tool; spatial distribution; streamflow; vulnerability; water resource; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066040162

Secondly, it emerges that policies related to environmental suitability and FDI should be based on a top-down approach at country level instead of bottom-up strategies. Finally, we find that research papers that used new plant establishment as a proxy of FDI are more likely to support PHH as compared to those used the stock definition. The results are encouraging enough to be referred to in the context of designing suitable climate negotiation policies where increasing externalities are generated as pollutions from FDI.

This study uses Bayesian joint models with integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) to predict future spatial density distributions in the form of common spatial trends of predator–prey overlap in 2050 under the “business-as-usual, worst-case” climate change scenario. This was done for combinations of six mobile marine predator species (gray seal, harbor seal, harbor porpoise, common guillemot, black-legged kittiwake, and northern gannet) and two of their common prey species (herring and sandeels). A range of five explanatory variables that cover both physical and biological aspects of critical marine habitat were used as follows: bottom temperature, stratification, depth-averaged speed, net primary production, and maximum subsurface chlorophyll. Four different methods were explored to quantify relative ecological cost/benefits of climate change to the common spatial trends of predator–prey density distributions. All but one future joint model showed significant decreases in overall spatial percentage change. The most dramatic loss in predator–prey population overlap was shown by harbor seals with large declines in the common spatial trend for both prey species. On the positive side, both gannets and guillemots are projected to have localized regions with increased overlap with sandeels. Most joint predator–prey models showed large changes in centroid location, however the direction of change in centroids was not simply northwards, but mostly ranged from northwest to northeast. This approach can be very useful in informing the design of spatial management policies under climate change by using the potential differences in ecological costs to weigh up the trade-offs in decisions involving issues of large-scale spatial use of our oceans, such as marine protected areas, commercial fishing, and large-scale marine renewable developments. © 2020 The Authors.

Building an emissions inventory is a standard procedure that most countries perform for regulatory or research purposes. At a European level, these inventories are developed using the standard Nomenclature for Reporting (NFR sectors). However, none of the NFR are exclusively for tourism or explicitly include it. This paper presents a methodology to estimate the emissions from main touristic activities, focusing on Portugal as a case study. The emissions were distributed using tourism data as a proxy, namely the contribution of tourism to characteristic industries, as well as the nights spent in tourism establishments by non-residents. The proxy data was used to distribute emissions throughout the municipalities, using the national reported emissions data as a starting point. An analysis of the spatial distribution of tourism emissions was performed, highlighting that tourism has a significant impact on atmospheric emissions over specific areas (up to 40.1%), and contributing to areas where air pollution is already an environmental stress factor (urban centres of Porto and Lisbon). While this methodological framework was developed specifically for Portugal, it may be adapted to assess atmospheric pollutant emissions from tourism activities in other regions. Beyond the methodology proposed and the analysis of the results, other alternative methods to estimate emissions from the tourism sector are discussed and suggested. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Atmospheric emissions estimate; Economic sectors; Tourism","Atmospheric spectra; Atmospheric emission; Atmospheric pollutant emissions; Economic sectors; Emissions inventory; Environmental stress; Methodological frameworks; Standard procedures; Tourism; Air pollution; atmospheric pollution; economic conditions; emission; emission inventory; environmental stress; spatial distribution; tourism; adult; air pollution; article; environmental stress; night; pollutant; Portugal; tourism; Lisboa [Portugal]; Lisbon; Porto [Portugal]; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074052956

Understanding and identifying the relevant geological processes over long time scales can be obtained only at natural-analogue sites. At one such site, in the Salt Wash Graben area of Utah, USA, widespread bleaching affects the Middle Jurassic red-bed ""wet dune"" Entrada Sandstone. Previous work has proposed a genetic link between the bleaching and spatially concomitant recent and modern CO2- rich fluids. The results presented here challenge some of the previous models and come from a detailed petrographic examination of mineralized fractures in the Entrada Sandstone that are centered in vertical extensions to the bleaching. These fractures typically contain complex mineralization assemblages. Pyrite was a paragenetically early phase, identifiable from common pseudomorphs of mixed iron oxides and oxyhydroxides that rarely contain relict pyrite. The pyrite contains up to 3 wt% arsenic. The volume of fracture-adjacent bleached sandstone is sufficient to have been the source of iron for the pyrite originally present in the fracture. The pyrite pseudomorphs occur at the center of fracture- and pore-filling cements that comprise intergrowths of hematite-goethite-jarosite-gypsum, an assemblage that suggests that their formation resulted from the oxidative alteration of pyrite, a genetic link supported by the arsenic present in the iron-bearing minerals. The presence of jarosite and proximal removal of earlier, sandstone-hosted carbonates are consistent with, and indicative of, the low-pH conditions associated with pyrite oxidation reactions. Calcite- and gypsum-cemented fractures crosscut, and contain fragments of, the pyritepseudomorphic and -oxidation assemblages, proving that they postdate pyrite formation and its subsequent oxidation, and that pyrite oxidation was not a result of modern weathering reactions. In outcrop, some calcite- and gypsumcemented fractures link with travertine deposits associated with the modern and recent CO2-rich fluids. The mineral assemblages observed here, and the paragenetic sequence that we have inferred, suggest that the fracture-associated bleaching patterns result from the fracture-fed movement of sulfur-bearing reducing fluids, with hydrogen sulfide the most likely bleaching agent. We conclude that bleaching adjacent to fractures is not genetically related to modern CO2-bearing fluids despite the spatial relationship. The bleaching was already present when the modern fluids utilized the same fracture-based fluid pathways.

This study was an action research using participatory rural appraisal. The results showed that so far the fishermen employed local wisdom in predicting the fish output of the peatland river. The method considered the rainy days rate in mapping the quantity of tuakang, pelumpung, toman, and snakehead freshwater fish species. Local flood occurrences became the main indicator of the initiation for high fish production period. The water hyacinths preservation in pandanus forest to support fish reproduction and sunlight-dependence manual fish processing indicated the naturefriendly behaviour of fishermen community. Several attempts have been taken to reinforce the adaptation strategy of fishermen, i.e.: (1) developing the capacity of fishermen group, including preparing the fish season calendar and, fishermen time map, also fishermen institution relation map; (2) conducting training for fish processing verification; and (3) advising on the processing of water hyacinth for alternative products. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Cell proliferation; Facsimile; Fish; Fish products; Rivers; Wetlands; Action research; Adaptation strategies; Climate change adaptation; Fish processing; Fish production; Freshwater fishes; Participatory rural appraisals; Water Hyacinth; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081104294

This is promoted by the “4 per 1000” Initiative, a multi-stakeholder platform aiming at increasing SOC storage through sustainable practices. The scientific and technical committee of the Initiative is working to identify indicators, research priorities and region-specific practices needed for their implementation. The Initiative received its name due to the global importance of soils for climate change, which can be illustrated by a thought experiment showing that an annual growth rate of only 0.4% of the standing global SOC stocks would have the potential to counterbalance the current increase in atmospheric CO2. However, there are numerous barriers to the rise in SOC stocks and while SOC sequestration can contribute to partly offsetting greenhouse gas emissions, its main benefits are related to increased soil quality and climate change adaptation. The Initiative provides a collaborative platform for policy makers, practitioners, scientists and stakeholders to engage in finding solutions. Criticism of the Initiative has been related to the poor definition of its numerical target, which was not understood as an aspirational goal. The objective of this paper is to present the aims of the initiative, to discuss critical issues and to present challenges for its implementation.

However, not much has been written about how international obligations on the matter and the EU’s assumed role as a normative power in this regard have impacted its objectives in relation to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), nor how the path toward their achievement has transformed the EU’s own development, energy and economic models. For example, obligations to reduce GHG as part of the Kyoto Protocol necessarily lead to changes in industry, making it more efficient and less polluting. The objectives adopted at the European level in relation to the increasing use of renewable energy also lead to a change in the current energy model, from a model in which the use of fossil energy was predominant to one in which renewable energy not only contributes to reducing GHG, but also increases the energy security of European states. The promotion of a circular economy and the initiative of creating an Energy Union are both examples of the transformations that the EU is experiencing. Both initiatives will help improve the environment by reducing GHG emissions and by increasing the production of renewable energy, while both, as a whole, will help the EU achieve its international and domestic commitments, thus consolidating its leadership in global environmental governance. What the chapter examines is thus how the EU has been transformed as a result of the agreements achieved in the international domain and its position as a global leader in environmental issues. Concretely, the chapter will analyze how international agreements and the EU’s leadership have fostered the adoption of domestic goals and, as a result, how the EU is reinforcing its international leadership and promoting the adoption of robust international agreements…. © 2020 by World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090973747

In Quebec, this share amounts to 43%, of which 80% is caused by road transport according to the MinistÉre de l’Environnement et de la Lutte contre les changements climatiques of QuÅbec. It is therefore essential to support the actions taken to reduce GHGs emissions from this sector and to quantify the impact of these actions. To do so, accurate and reliable emission models are needed. Driving cycles are defined as speed profiles over time and they are a key element of emission models. They represent driving behaviors specific to various road types in each region. The most widely used method to construct driving cycles is based on Markov chains and consists of concatenating small sections of speed profiles, called microtrips, following a transition matrix. Two of the main steps involved in the development of driving cycles are microtrip segmentation and microtrip classification. In this study, several combinations of segmentation and clustering methods are compared to generate the most reliable driving cycle. Results show that segmentation of microtrips with a fixed distance of 250 m and clustering of the microtrips by applying a principal component analysis on many key parameters related to their speed and acceleration provide the most accurate driving cycles. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",,"Environmental Protection Agency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Roads and streets; Development method; Driving behavior; Global emissions; Reliable driving; Segmentation and clustering; Transition matrices; Transportation sector; United States environmental protection agency; Markov chains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101207058

This study explored the influence of ethanol fueling and aromatic concentration on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production by utilizing two E10 fuels with different aromatic levels and two higher ethanol blends (i.e., E30 and E78). The diluted emissions from both FFVs were photooxidized in a 30 m3 mobile atmospheric chamber with two distinct initial conditions, while the vehicles operated over cold-start and hot-start LA92 test cycles. Testing revealed that one vehicle did not produce secondary aerosol when emissions were photooxidized with a single precursor oxidant. However significant SOA formation occurred in the presence of an anthropogenic volatile organic carbon surrogate and NOx mixture in the chamber, despite the fact that both vehicles had similar primary particulate emission levels. The secondary aerosol formed in an urban airshed was mainly composed of ammonium nitrate and significantly exceeded primary tailpipe PM emissions. Cold-start operation from both vehicles led to greater secondary aerosol production compared to hot-start LA92 operation. SOA production showed a strong relationship with the tailpipe non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) emissions and overall reduced with higher ethanol blending in the fuel. The impact of aromatics was clear, with the higher aromatic E10 fuel showing higher SOA formation than the lower aromatic E10 fuel. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aromatics; Ethanol; Gasoline direct injection; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Secondary organic aerosol (SOA)","Aerosols; Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Blending; Dynamometers; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Exhaust systems (engine); Gasoline; Organic carbon; Particulate emissions; Vehicles; Aromatics; Atmospheric chambers; Gasoline direct injection; Gasoline direct injection engine(GDI); Non-methane hydrocarbons; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Secondary organic aerosols; Volatile organic carbons; Direct injection; alcohol; ammonium nitrate; aromatic compound; gasoline; hydrocarbon; volatile organic compound; aerosol; aerosol formation; ammonium nitrate; ethanol; nonmethane hydrocarbon; particulate matter; traffic emission; transport vehicle; aerosol; Article; atmosphere; carbon footprint; particulate matter; priority journal; secondary organic aerosol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074099652

Atmospheric releases of uranium from plant operations were estimated from stack sampling and production records. Releases occurred through stacks, rooftop vents, and an incinerator that operated from 1964 to 1969. Roof vents that exhausted workplace air was the major emission source from the plant. Total estimated release of uranium activity (including 234U, 235U, and 238U) to the air was 27.9 GBq. Atmospheric transport modeling was performed using a complex terrain model because the plant was located in an incised river valley. Almost two years of meteorological data were collected from a nearby 10-m tower, along with sounding from a collocated sodar. Light mean wind speed (1.56 m s−1) and predominately stable atmospheric conditions frequently resulted in poor dispersion conditions in the facility environs. Environmental sampling included continuous air monitoring data and depth profiles of uranium in soil that was deposited from airborne releases. Soil measurements exhibited a sharp drop-off in uranium concentrations with distance from the facility, indicating that large non-inhalable particles were emitted to the atmosphere. Large particles (~15–25 μm aerodynamic equivalent diameter) accounted for 17.5% of the total emissions. Soil measurements were used for model calibration and validation, while air measurements were used to evaluate model performance. Air concentrations were generally over-predicted for locations near the facility but showed only a slight positive bias for locations north of the facility.

This concern is especially relevant in cities with fast-growing economies in the developing countries, as is the case of Lima Metropolitan Area (LMA) in Peru. Currently, there is a limited understanding of the impacts of ground transportation emissions on air pollution and population health in the LMA. In this study we quantified air pollution emissions from ground transportation, by combining local transportation and meteorological data with emission factors determined by the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (US-EPA's) Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator (MOVES). Total annual emissions of carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide and particulate matter (PM2.5) were quantified, temporally resolved and then spatially disaggregated within the LMA study domain. Our study, therefore, provides an approach for quantifying transportation emissions for a large metropolitan area in a developing country where detailed data is not available. This research sets the need of future work aiming at understanding the impact of ground transportation emissions, air pollution levels and their subsequent effects on human health.

Methanotrophic bacteria oxidize methane to bicarbonate and also assimilate some methane-derived carbon into biomass. Their metabolism transforms methane to other forms of carbon and sequesters it within the system, reducing its emission to the atmosphere. Increases in water temperatures driven by global climate change may accelerate the methane flux from the benthos into the water column, potentially increasing the importance of methanotrophic consumption as a methane sink. We report methane concentrations and oxidation rates in the water column of the Chukchi Sea from August 2017. This area is characterized by seasonally high nutrient concentrations that fuel high rates of pelagic primary productivity and subsequent sedimentation of organic matter, which stimulates benthic methanogenesis. Methane concentrations in the study area ranged from 6 to 72 nmol L−1, consistent with previously published measurements. Methane oxidation rates were as high as 580 pmol L−1 d−1, similar to the rates measured in the East Siberian Arctic Shelf. Depth-integrated methane oxidation rates were lower than methane efflux rates, suggesting that physiochemical factors prevent the methanotrophic microbial community from efficiently removing methane from the ecosystem. Still, methanotrophic bacteria provide an ecosystem service by removing a fraction of methane prior to its efflux to the atmosphere. © 2019 Association for the Sciences of Limnology and Oceanography",,"benthos; bicarbonate; climate change; concentration (composition); continental margin; methane; methanogenic bacterium; methanotrophy; oxidation; pelagic environment; seasonality; Arctic Ocean; Chukchi Sea; Siberian Shelf",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078231558

This research note, which is part of a larger research project on climate change adaptation in Caribbean coastal communities, reviews the recent literature on human system adaptations to climate change at the local level in the Caribbean. It seeks to answer two questions: (1) How are human systems at the local level adapting to climate change in the Caribbean? (2) What challenges exist for local-level climate adaptations in human systems that seek to protect vulnerable communities in the Caribbean? The studies reviewed highlight the importance of considering the vulnerability of sub-populations, protecting their livelihoods, and pursuing institutional cooperation at the local and national levels. In interrogating whether the recommendations for community adaptations in the literature are transferrable to other geographies, this note further emphasizes that understanding the challenges that communities face in protecting human systems against climate change can help policy-makers develop more effective adaptation strategies that centre climate justice. © 2020, © 2020 The Royal Danish Geographical Society.","Adaptation; Caribbean; climate change; human systems; local communities; vulnerability",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080114218

In the present work, a standard building representative of the existing buildings in Spain built before 1980 was used. An evaluation of the energy rating of that building in each climatic zone of Spain was carried out to assess the influence of these climatic conditions on energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. This analysis was carried out with Cerma software according to the calculation procedure demanded by the Spanish Building Technical Code. Results show that E or F energy score was obtained for the different climatic zones and with significant differences in CO2 emissions, even for climatic zones with the same energy rating. A sensitivity study of the necessary enhancements in each climatic zone was carried out to analyze the influence of most common energy demand and thermal system improvements, and combinations of them. Also, the minimum requirements to obtain D qualification in each Spanish climatic zone were obtained. As a result, it is possible to reduce emissions in Spain by over 3.5 Mt CO2 per year. In climatic zones with initial qualification E, it is possible to reach a D label, avoiding 40% of the initial CO2 emissions and reducing primary energy consumption to about 50 kWh/m2 year (over 60% reduction). For the climatic zones with initial qualification F, over 53% of the initial CO2 emissions are avoided by reaching D label. Zones with the highest heating demand (over 230 kWh/m2 year) and very low cooling demand need to improve thermal systems by means of a heat pump. Finally, some policy measures to create lines of financial aids or subsidies for the implementation of actions to reduce energy demand in Spanish homes are proposed.

Given the potential impacts of such policies on every-day routines and behaviours, the factors that might increase or decrease their public acceptance require investigation. Here we study the role of specific policy design features in shaping Americans’ preferences for policy proposals to phase out fossil fuel cars. In light of the urgency of action against climate change, we are specifically interested in citizens’ preferences with respect to the timing of phase-out policies. Based on a demographically representative sample of 1,520 American residents rating 24,320 hypothetical policy scenarios in a conjoint experiment, we find that Americans prefer phase-out policies to be implemented no later than 2030. Policy features other than timing are also important: higher policy costs significantly reduce public support; subsidies for alternative technologies are preferred over taxes and bans; and policy co-benefits in terms of pollution reduction increase public support only when they are substantial. The study also investigates the role of individual characteristics in shaping policy preferences, finding that perceived psychological distance of climate change and party identification influence policy preferences. The results of this study have important implications for the political feasibility of rapid decarbonization initiatives like the ‘Green New Deal’ that are now being discussed in the US and beyond. Among these is the insight that smart sequencing of policies (early implementation of subsidies for low-emission technologies, followed by tax increases and/or bans) might help ensure majority support for a fossil fuel car phase-out. Key Policy Insights On average, respondents prefer policies to phase out fossil fuel cars to take effect no later than 2030. Party identification and perceived psychological distance of climate change influence timing preferences for phase-out policies. On average, subsidies for low-emission alternatives find higher public support than hard regulations, such as increases of fossil fuels taxes and bans on new fossil fuel cars sales. Smart sequencing of subsidies for alternative technologies and hard regulations should help increase the public acceptance of a phase-out of fossil-fuel cars. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change policies; conjoint experiment; Decarbonization; fossil fuel vehicles; phase-out; temporal preferences","automobile; carbon emission; climate change; emission control; environmental policy; fossil fuel; preference behavior; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074335207

We explore the chemical consequences of impacts within the context of reducing planetary atmospheres dominated by carbon monoxide, methane, and molecular nitrogen. A terawatt high-power laser was selected in order to simulate the airglow plasma and blast wave surrounding the impactor. The chemical results of these experiments are then applied to a theoretical atmospheric model. The impact simulation results in substantial volume mixing ratios within the reactor of 5% hydrogen cyanide (HCN), 8% acetylene (C2H2), 5% cyanoacetylene (HC3N), and 1% ammonia (NH3). These yields are combined with estimated impact rates for the early Earth to predict surface boundary conditions for an atmospheric model. We show that impacts might have served as sources of energy that would have led to steady-state surface quantities of 0.4% C2H2, 400 ppm HCN, and 40 ppm NH3. We provide simulated transit spectra for an Earth-like exoplanet with this reducing atmosphere during and shortly after eras of intense impacts. We predict that acetylene is as observable as other molecular features on exoplanets with reducing atmospheres that have recently gone through their own ""heavy bombardments,"" with prominent features at 3.05 and 10.5 μm. © 2019.

Achieving effective conservation of marine biodiversity has become a fast-moving target because of both global climate change and continuous shifts in marine policies. How prepared are we to deal with this crisis? We examined EU Member States Programs of Measures designed for the implementation of EU marine environmental policies, as well as recent European Marine Spatial Plans, and discovered that climate change is rarely considered operationally. Further, our analysis revealed that monitoring programs in marine protected areas are often insufficient to clearly distinguish between impacts of local and global stressors. Finally, we suggest that while the novel global Blue Growth approach may jeopardize previous marine conservation efforts, it can also provide new conservation opportunities. Adaptive management is the way forward (e.g., preserving ecosystem functions in climate change hotspots, and identifying and targeting climate refugia areas for protection) using Marine Spatial Planning as a framework for action, especially given the push for Blue Growth. © 2019 The Authors.

The prediction results get mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) close to 2 percent when the region under study has an energy matrix mostly based on fossil fuels, less intermittent. For regions in which more renewable sources are present, the MAPE is around 12 percent. However, in either case, LSTM can predict the hours well with smaller emissions among the next 24 hours.

Sawgrass (Cladium jamaicense), the dominant macrophyte in the Everglades, has two phenotypes that vary in size and density between Everglades marl prairies and peat marshes. Marl prairies have recently been hypothesized to be a newly formed habitat developed after European colonization as a result of landscape-scale hydrologic modifications, implying that sawgrass marl phenotypes developed in response to the marl habitat. We examined whether sawgrass wetland phenotypes are plastic responses to marl and peat soils. Methods: In a common-mesocosm experiment, seedlings from a single Everglades population were grown outdoors in field-collected marl or peat soils. Growth and morphology of plants were measured over 14 mo, while soil and leaf total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total carbon, and plant biomass and biomass allocation were determined in a final harvest. Results: Sawgrass plant morphology diverged in marl vs. peat soils, and variations in morphology and density of mesocosm-grown plants resembled differences seen in sawgrass plants growing in marl and peat habitats in Everglades wetlands. Additionally, sawgrass growing in marl made abundant dauciform roots, while dauciform root production of sawgrass growing in peat was correlated with soil total phosphorus. Conclusions: Sawgrass from a single population grown in marl or peat soils can mimic sawgrass phenotypes associated with marl vs. peat habitats. This plasticity is consistent with the hypothesis that Everglades marl prairies are relatively new habitats that support plant communities assembled after European colonization and subsequent landscape modifications. © 2019 The Authors.

This rejection of classical forms of suburbanization has, in part, increased property values in neighborhoods offering these amenities, displacing lower-income, often non-white, residents. Increased prevalence of creative and technology workers appears to accelerate this trend. We argue that a significant and understudied socio-environmental contradiction also occurs where the actual environmental outcomes of neighborhood transformation may not be what we expect. New research on greenhouse gas emissions shows that more affluent residents have much larger carbon footprints because of their consumption, even when reductions in transportation or building energy emissions are included. We describe an area in Seattle, Washington, the location of Amazon's headquarters, experiencing this contradiction and show a distinct convergence of city investments in low-carbon infrastructure, significant rises in housing prices and decreases in lower-income and non-white residents. We conclude with a discussion of a range of issues that require more attention by scholars interested in housing justice and/or urban sustainability. © 2019 Urban Research Publications Limited","carbon gentrification; climate governance; low carbon; Seattle; social justice; urban sustainability; USA; Washington","carbon emission; carbon footprint; climate effect; gentrification; greenhouse gas; neighborhood; social justice; sustainability; urban area; Seattle; United States; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062565785

Background: In conventional hadron therapy, the goal is to create a homogenous dose in the tumour area and, thus, achieve a uniform cell survival level. Since the induction of a specific damage to cells is directly influenced by the level of hypoxia in the tissue, the varying oxygen pressure in the different regions of hypoxic tumours would disrupt the uniformity of the cell survival level. Materials and methods: Using the Geant4 Monte Carlo Code, the physical dose profile and dose-averaged linear energy transfer were calculated in the tumour. Then, the oxygen enhancement ratio in different areas of the tumour were compared with different pressures. Results: Modulations of radiation intensities as well as energies of ion beams were calculated, both considering and disregarding the effect of hypoxia, and the required dose profiles were compared with each other. Cell survival levels were also compared between the two methods. An equation was obtained for re-modulating the beams in the presence of hypoxia, and radiation weighting factors were extracted for the beam intensities. Conclusion: The results show that taking the effect of hypoxia into account would cause the reduction of average doses delivered to the tumour tissues up to 1.54 times. In this regard, the required dose is reduced by 1.63 times in the healthy tissues before the tumour. This will result in an effective protection of healthy tissues around the tumour. © 2019 Greater Poland Cancer Centre","Hadron therapy; Hypoxic tumour; Monte Carlo; OER","animal cell; Article; cancer radiotherapy; cell survival; CHO-K1 cell line; female; intensity modulated radiation therapy; ion therapy; linear energy transfer; Monte Carlo method; neoplasm; nonhuman; oxygen enhancement ratio; radiation beam; radiation dose; radiosensitivity; treatment planning; tumor hypoxia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076670212

This research presents high-resolution seismic profiles and sediment cores retrieved from Sites U1465, U1469, and U1470 drilled during International Ocean Discovery Program (IODP) Expedition 359. A microfacies analysis of the platform deposits was conducted and correlated with a sequence stratigraphic analysis of seismic reflection data. The Neogene evolution of the Maldives encompasses a series of drowning steps. Two of these steps are compared with regard to the carbonate factory type to unravel if fossil assemblage surviving the first drowning step are different from younger assemblages. In both cases the shallow water carbonate facies are formed by coral-coralline algal boundstone and foralgal floatstone that change basinwards into slope facies dominated by large benthic foraminifera grainstone to packstone, locally floatstone and rudstone. The red algae and large benthic foraminifera assemblages are similar before and after the first drowning step. After this first drowning, the carbonate platform developed under enhanced bottom current conditions, as deduced by the coeval drift deposits. The carbonate platform and the drift deposits were balanced for circa 2 Myr, until a global sea-level fall at 10.6 Ma and later reflooding of the platform, which destroyed the equilibrium between both depositional systems, favouring the current-controlled deposits. The drowning of the Miocene carbonate platform of the Maldives was the result of the combined effect of the fluctuating sea-level during the Neogene and the intensification of oceanic currents due to the invigoration of the South Asian Monsoon during the middle Miocene. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbonate facies; Coral reef; Eustasy; Leg 359; Oceanic currents; Sea level","benthic foraminifera; bottom current; carbonate platform; coral reef; estuary; facies; fossil assemblage; geometry; microfacies; Neogene; sea level change; seismic reflection; shallow water; Maldives; algae; Anthozoa; Foraminifera; Rhodophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075976025

To date, little research has been conducted on investigating the effects of MPs on the soil microbial community, which plays a vital role in biogeochemical cycling. In the present study, we investigate the influence of two particle sizes of MPs on dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and its relative functional groups, fluxes of greenhouse gases (GHGs), and the bacterial and fungal communities in fertilized soil. The results showed that a 5% concentration of MPs had no significant effect on soil DOC, whereas the formation of aromatic functional groups was accelerated. In fertilized soil, the existence of MPs decreased the global warming potential (GWP) as a result of a reduction in N2O emissions during the first three days. A potential mechanism for this reduction in N2O emissions might be that MPs inhibited the phylum Chloroflexi, Rhodoplanes genera, and increased the abundance of Thermoleophilia on day 3. An increase in N2O emissions was observed on day 30, mainly due to the acceleration of the NO3− reduction and a decrease in the abundance of Gemmatimonadacea. The CH4 uptake was significantly correlated with Hyphomicrobiaceae on day 3 and Rhodomicrobium on day 30. In soil with MPs, Actinobacteria replaced Proteobacteria as the dominant phylum. Larger MPs increased the richness (Chao1) and abundance-based coverage estimators (ACE) and diversity (Shannon) of the bacterial community on day 3, whereas these decreased on day 30. The richness and diversity of the fungal community were also reduced on days 3 and 30. Smaller MPs increased the community richness and diversity of both bacterial and fungal communities in fertilized soil.

Herein, 3D hybrid structures composed of 0D FeNi nanoalloys embedded in 1D N-doped bamboo-like CNTs tangled with 2D N-doped carbon nanosheets (FeNi@N-CNT/NCSs) are rationally fabricated through a feasible carbonization strategy. Benefiting from the firmly N-doped carbon-wrapped FeNi nanoalloys as catalytic sites and hierarchically porous nanoarchitecture for efficient mass diffusion and electron transport, the fabricated FeNi@N-CNT/NCSs exhibit high multifunctional electrochemcial activities, comparable to that of noble-metal-based benchmarks, associated with impressive stability. It is indicated that the FeNi alloys evidently determine electrocatalytic activities, and the presence of FeNi alloys obviously improve long-term reaction stability. In addition, the atomic ratio of Fe to Ni in FeNi alloys can significantly affect the electrochemical performance toward oxygen evolution reaction, oxygen reduction reaction, and hydrogen evolution reaction. By using FeNi@N-CNT/NCSs as the anodic and cathodic electrocatalysts, an outstanding overall water splitting performance is obtained with the low cell potential and good durability in 1.0 KOH. The assembled Zn-air batteries with the FeNi@N-CNT/NCSs air cathode using the liquid-state and all-solid-state electrolyte exhibit the superior charging-discharging performance, robust lifetime, and high flexibility, capturing the critical potential in actual implementation of metal-air batteries with portable or wearable characteristics. This work will shed advanced inspiration for the fabrication of highly-efficient multifunctional catalysts for various energy technologies.

However, policies differ in how they allocate emission responsibilities among stakeholders. For example, the Chile emission tax directly penalizes manufacturers for the emissions they generate during their production (production-based emission tax), whereas the Sweden electricity emission tax penalizes the consumption of electricity rather than its production (consumption-based emission tax). These two methods have potentially varying implications on manufacturers' profits, their emission abatement decisions, as well as the resulting emission levels, especially when demand uncertainty is involved. In this paper, we investigate the impact of the two distinct methods by studying a profit-maximizing manufacturer facing stochastic demand. Under either production- or consumption-based emission tax, the manufacturer's optimal decisions on its selling price, production quantity and emission abatement investment are derived. Perhaps surprisingly, we show that under either tax, it is possible for an increase in the emission tax to discourage the manufacturer from investing in emission abatement. The impact of tax rate, abatement technology efficiency, and demand uncertainty on the manufacturer's profitability and abatement decision are also studied. Interestingly, higher demand uncertainty may motivate the manufacturer to invest more in emission abatement under production-based emission tax. Using a numerical example of an electricity power generator, we offer further insights into the comparison between the two taxes and find that there exist cases for either tax to dominate the other in terms of both profit and emissions. © 2019","Emission abatement; Emission tax; Green technology; Newsvendor model; Sustainability","Electric power generation; Profitability; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Taxation; Abatement technologies; Demand uncertainty; Emission abatement; Green technology; Newsvendor models; Optimal decisions; Production quantity; Stochastic demand; Manufacture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067052994

What originated as a scientific question has evolved into a complex political and social issue. The policy context recognises the pivotal role of education in encouraging effective engagement and behavioural responses to projected climate changes. It is relatively easy to nod assent to the principles of climate change education and engagement, but harder to deliver. This paper explores experiences of educating and engaging current and future decision makers, namely pupils, teachers, charity workers, small business owners and councillors on the subject of climate change in Wales. It draws conclusions about the existing climate for learning as well as the potential for overcoming challenges associated with information needs of these existing and future decision-makers. It considers the broader issue of whether current climate change information and education frameworks are fit for purpose and able to support effective climate change mitigation and adaptation activities. The findings suggest that many climate change communications from international organisations are not being received or understood at local levels, indicating a need for further and simpler ‘translation’ of science. Despite a strong formal education system in Wales, there are variations in basic skills (such as map reading and graph interpretation), required for simple climate change science interpretation. Finally, our results point to a need for climate literacy to be gained through interactive long-term learning rather than one-off training, particularly given some of the entrenched views of the older age groups involved in the study. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change education; Climate Change Engagement; Education framework","climate change; climate effect; decision making; education; geographical knowledge; learning; mitigation; United Kingdom; Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051675298

The average mass concentrations of PM2.5 at the urban, roadside, industrial, and rural sites were 31.5 ± 14.8, 31.6 ± 22.3, 31.4 ± 16.0, and 25.8 ± 12.4 μg/m3, respectively. Except for secondary ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate, the model results showed that the traffic source (i.e., the sum of gasoline and diesel vehicle sources) was the most dominant source of PM2.5 (17.1%) followed by biomass burning (13.8%) at the urban site. The major primary sources of PM2.5 were consistent with the site characteristics (diesel vehicle source at the roadside site, coal-fired plants at the industrial site, and biomass burning at the rural site). Seasonal data from the urban site suggested that ammonium sulfate and ammonium nitrate were the most dominant sources of PM2.5 during all seasons. Further, the contribution of road dust source to PM2.5 increased during spring and fall seasons. We conclude that the determination of the major PM2.5 sources is useful for establishing efficient control strategies for PM2.5 in different regions and seasons. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","ambient atmosphere; Chemical characteristics; PM2.5; sources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075951171

Such massive changes in the environment are altering the ecology, creating sustainable development challenges such as climate-related extreme weather events. Super Typhoon Haiyan devastated portions of Southeast Asia, particularly the Philippines, on November 8, 2013, that caused physical and psychological illnesses to the affected. To prevent these impacts and make cities sustainably develop and Climate Change (CC) resilient, a Science and Policy Framework (SPF) piloting Quezon City Local Government (QCLG) is developed. The application of SPF revealed, among others, the QCLG institutional and personnel adaptive capacities, threat level of CC-related hazards on development growth sectors and institutional and personnel relative vulnerabilities. These findings allowed QCLG to develop sectoral Local Climate Change Action Plan (LCCAP) 2017-2027 to mainstream CC Adaptation (CCA) at the very early stages of development planning. The SPF and LCCAP are flexible and fashioned toward enhancing key development sectors in creating sustainable and CCA-resilient Cities.

Replacing these appliances has several environmental benefits, including the removal of air pollution sources and the reduction of Green House Gasses (GHG) emissions. In this work, we present the techno-economic and environmental evaluation of implementing DHW HPs in Turin, where 66% of the DHW demand is covered by dedicated gas boilers. The impact of such boilers was assessed through numerical air dispersion modeling conducted with the software SPRAY (Aria Technologies, Paris, French). Results show that removing these sources would reduce yearly average concentrations of NOx up to 1.4 µg/m3, i.e., about 1% of monitored concentrations of NOx, with a benefit of 1.05 ÷ 15.15 M€/y of avoided health externalities. Replacing boilers with DHW HPs is always financially feasible with current incentives while, in their absence, it would be convenient for residential units with 3 cohabitants or more (51.22% of the total population), thanks to scale economies. © 2020 by the authors.

This has resulted in a significant change in the way we deal with cities. In recent years, efforts toward achieving resilient cities have been strengthened with various initiatives and actions. Internationally, among the key initiatives are the launching of Sustainable Development Goals, New Urban Agenda, and Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction, the Paris Agreement to achieve climate and disaster resilient within cities. Development plans are known to be essential documents to present strategies to guide future development, thus have the potential to ensure the improvement of the city's resilience. Hence, this paper aimed at assessing the current state of the adoption of climate change adaptation and disaster risk reduction strategies in the various level of development planning. Based on the content analysis method, the paper discusses the different types of adaptation and mitigation interventions at national, state and local level plans aimed at reducing the impact of climate change and disaster risk in cities. Malaysian's federal policy documents (Eleventh Malaysia Plan, National Physical Plan III and National Urbanisation Policy II), state structure plans (Kuala Lumpur Structure Plan 2020 and Pahang State Structure Plan 2035) and local development plans (Kuala Lumpur City Plan 2030 and Cameron Highlands Draft Local Plan 2030) were referred to for this purpose. Overall, findings of the study indicated that at the national level, aspects of CCA and DRR are limited to the environment and infrastructure sector. However, locally, much higher integration of CCA and DRR strategies are evident in the Cameron Highlands Draft Local Plan 2030. Thus, it is realised that Malaysia is progressing positively towards mainstreaming CCA and DRR strategy in the different level of development plans crossing all sectors with various types of interventions. However, more effort is needed to focus on the collaborative action in the implementation of the strategies and actions stipulated in the development plans. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Disasters; Planning; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Climate change adaptation; Climate related risks; Content analysis method; Development planning; Disaster risk reductions; Higher integration; Infrastructure sector; Urban development; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078997113

Tree transpiration in a multi-species urban garden in southern Italy was investigated for one year, on hourly, daily, seasonal and annual time scale. Water status of trees was determined by means of the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI). The difference between canopy and air temperature was calculated using transpiration measurements and the canopy energy balance. Transpiration was measured by heat dissipation method (HDM) in more than 14 tree species, grouped in four classes (Olea, Citrus and Eriobotrya, Conifers and Broadleaves) according to number of specimens in the garden and similarity in plant functional category. At single tree scale, the radial trend of sap flux density was modeled considering the sapwood area, while the upscaling to the garden level was performed using the quantile method integrated by trunk diameter classification. Complete daytime time series of sap flux density were obtained by gap filling algorithms, based on multivariate models based on environmental drivers of transpiration. Tree transpiration showed that Olea and Citrus and Eriobotrya had a good adaptation to Mediterranean climates. CWSI values indicated that Conifers suffered a moderate water shortage, while the other species were subjected to higher water shortage. Conifers showed the maximum efficacy in lowering air temperature, followed by Broadleaves, Olea and Citrus and Eriobotrya. The uncertainties were evaluated by error analysis. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air cooling; Broadleaves; Citrus sinensis; Conifers; CWSI; Eriobotrya japonica; HDM; Olea europaea; Sap flow","air temperature; broad-leaved forest; climate change; coniferous tree; cooling; dicotyledon; environmental quality; interception; sap flow; Italy; Mediterranean Region; Citrus; Citrus sinensis; Coniferophyta; Eriobotrya; Eriobotrya japonica; Olea europaea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072705885

The case study showed the positive results, particularly savings of 57 GWh and 100 Mm3 in a period of twelve years when different measures from the common ones were developed for the monitoring and control of water losses in smart water management. These savings contributed to reducing the CO2 emissions to 47,385 t CO2-eq. Finally, in order to evaluate the financial effort and savings obtained in this reference systems (RS) network, the investment required in the monitoring and water losses control in a correlation model case (CMC) was estimated, and, as a consequence, the losses level presented a significant reduction towards sustainable values in the next nine years.

Semi-arid southern California and the relatively mesic environments of California's Channel Islands provide a model system for examining drought responses of plants in potential climate change refugia. Most methods for detecting refugia are focused on 'exposure' of organisms to certain abiotic conditions, which fail to assess how local adaptation or acclimation of plant traits (i.e. 'sensitivity') contribute to or offset the benefits of reduced exposure. Here, we use a comparative plant hydraulics approach to characterize the vulnerability of plants to drought, providing a framework for identifying the locations and trait patterns that underlie functioning climate change refugia. Seasonal water relations, xylem hydraulic traits and remotely sensed vegetation indices of matched island and mainland field sites were used to compare the response of native plants from contrasting island and mainland sites to hotter droughts in the early 21st century. Island plants experienced more favorable water relations and resilience to recent drought. However, island plants displayed low plasticity/adaptation of hydraulic traits to local conditions, which indicates that relatively conserved traits of island plants underlie greater hydraulic safety and localized buffering from regional drought conditions. Our results provide an explanation for how California's Channel Islands function as a regional climate refugia during past and current climate change and demonstrate a physiology-based approach for detecting potential climate change refugia in other systems. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

One of the important variables in this context is precipitation. The investigation of precipitation, one of the most important meteorological factors directly affecting accessibility to water resources, is of special importance. In every region, studies of precipitation on daily, monthly, or annual scales provide important information on the distribution, concentration, and dispersion of precipitation, as well as some conclusions about the associated hydrological problems. In this study, the precipitation concentration was calculated and zoned by means of the precipitation concentration index (PCI) in the basin of Lake Urmia, using monthly and annual rainfall data of 42 selected rain gauge stations, from which 24 stations located in the West Azerbaijan province (in the west of Lake Urmia) and 18 stations located in the East Azerbaijan province (in the east of Lake Urmia) during 1984–2013. The results of the studies of the precipitation concentration index over the basin of Lake Urmia showed that the dominant concentrations of spring, autumn, and winter precipitation were moderate, indicating a moderate distribution for the precipitation of the months in these seasons. In addition, in the period under study, uniform and regular precipitation concentrations (PCI<10) were observed only in winter and in the borders of the basin. In summer, almost the entire surface of the basin (excluding its northeastern part) faced a strongly irregular distribution of precipitation, indicating irregular rainfall in July, August, and September. Most of the basin of Lake Urmia is covered by an irregular distribution of precipitation on an annual scale. By investigating the precipitation distribution in the first and the last 10 years of the statistical period considered and by comparing them, it was revealed that the greatest increase in the precipitation concentration index was in autumn, it rose by approximately 20.55 percent. According to the results, on the basin scale, the concentration index showed that the daily rainfall of the Lake Urmia basin was neither in regular nor in strongly irregular conditions at any of the stations studied. All the stations studied were in fairly regular, moderate concentration and fairly irregular conditions of daily precipitation distribution. The results also showed that the moderate concentration includes most of the daily precipitation distributions throughout the basin. © 2020, Hungarian Meteorological Service.

In this study, the rumen microbiome from Holstein cows was characterized through a combination of 16S rRNA gene and shotgun metagenomic sequencing. Methane production (CH4) and dry matter intake (DMI) were individually measured over 4–6 weeks to calculate the CH4 yield (CH4y = CH4/DMI) per cow. We implemented a combination of clustering, multivariate and mixed model analyses to identify a set of operational taxonomic unit (OTU) jointly associated with CH4y and the structure of ruminal microbial communities. Three ruminotype clusters (R1, R2 and R3) were identified, and R2 was associated with higher CH4y. The taxonomic composition on R2 had lower abundance of Succinivibrionaceae and Methanosphaera, and higher abundance of Ruminococcaceae, Christensenellaceae and Lachnospiraceae. Metagenomic data confirmed the lower abundance of Succinivibrionaceae and Methanosphaera in R2 and identified genera (Fibrobacter and unclassified Bacteroidales) not highlighted by metataxonomic analysis. In addition, the functional metagenomic analysis revealed that samples classified in cluster R2 were overrepresented by genes coding for KEGG modules associated with methanogenesis, including a significant relative abundance of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase enzyme. Based on the cluster assignment, we applied a sparse partial least-squares discriminant analysis at the taxonomic and functional levels. In addition, we implemented a sPLS regression model using the phenotypic variation of CH4y. By combining these two approaches, we identified 86 discriminant bacterial OTUs, notably including families linked to CH4 emission such as Succinivibrionaceae, Ruminococcaceae, Christensenellaceae, Lachnospiraceae and Rikenellaceae. These selected OTUs explained 24% of the CH4y phenotypic variance, whereas the host genome contribution was ~14%. In summary, we identified rumen microbial biomarkers associated with the methane production of dairy cows; these biomarkers could be used for targeted methane-reduction selection programmes in the dairy cattle industry provided they are heritable. © 2019 The Authors.

Statistical models are most commonly used for near-term HAB forecasting and resource management, but statistical models are not well suited for longer-term projections as forcing conditions diverge from past observations. Process-based models are more complex, difficult to parameterize, and require extensive calibration, but can mechanistically project HAB response under changing forcing conditions. Nevertheless, process-based models remain prone to failure if key processes emerge with climate change that were not identified in model development based on historical observations. We review recent studies on modeling HABs and their response to climate change, and the various statistical and process-based approaches used to link global climate model projections and potential HAB response. We also make several recommendations for how the field can move forward: 1) use process-based models to explicitly represent key physical and biological factors in HAB development, including evaluating HAB response to climate change in the context of the broader ecosystem; 2) quantify and convey model uncertainty using ensemble approaches and scenario planning; 3) use robust approaches to downscale global climate model results to the coastal regions that are most impacted by HABs; and 4) evaluate HAB models with long-term observations, which are critical for assessing long-term trends associated with climate change and far too limited in extent. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Harmful algal blooms; Numerical modeling","algal bloom; climate change; ecosystem; forecasting; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Forecasting; Harmful Algal Bloom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076974902

They are completely flooded between June and November and planted with Boro rice when floodwater recedes in December. However, early harvest period (April/May) floods frequently damage ripening rice. A calibrated/validated Soil and Water Assessment Tool for riparian wetland (SWATrw) model is perturbed with bias free (using an improved quantile mapping approach) climate projections from 17 general circulation models (GCMs) for the period 2031–2050. Projected mean annual rainfall increases (200–500 mm or 7–10%).

Design/methodology/approach: The study used a back-casting approach to cover hazard assessment induced by increased susceptibility, as well as vulnerability, both as a baseline study and projected up to 2045 at the micro level. The urban village (Kelurahan) level is the unit of analysis. The capacity analysis is used as baseline data, which is reviewed against the trend of the hazard and vulnerability. Findings: The results of the study identify short-, medium- and long-term recommendations to integrate disaster risk reduction and climate change adaption. These include capacity building, especially emergency response capabilities, an increase of drainage capacity, improvements to transboundary management and minimising driving forces. Practical implications: These findings at the micro level are very important to present a more holistic and realistic strategy that can be implemented until 2045, but also provides a basis for up scaling into metropolitan region planning. Originality/value: This is a unique, micro-scale case study in the Cilincing sub-district of Jakarta that assesses and develops strategic disaster risk countermeasures and a reduction plan that integrates the effects of climate change, thereby addressing future disaster risk in Jakarta. © 2019, Harkunti Pertiwi Rahayu, Richard Haigh, Dilanthi Amaratunga, Benedictus Kombaitan, Devina Khoirunnisa and Vito Pradana.","Back-casting approach; Flood risk management; Indonesia; Jakarta; Land-use change; Socio-economic change","adaptation; climate change; disaster management; flooding; hazard assessment; land use change; risk assessment; socioeconomic conditions; village; Indonesia; Jakarta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076511524

This article explores American state policy toward methane that is not captured and instead released into the atmosphere during oil and gas production. It examines whether states have adopted market-based approaches to price methane flaring and venting through long-standing severance taxes on natural gas extraction. Such taxes exist in all but one production state, routinely materializing after prolonged adoption battles. Most states have maintained methane release exemptions from these taxes through either statute or administrative discretion between 1960 and 2000, although a few have allowed some form of pricing. Two state legislatures have explored applying these taxes to methane releases on multiple occasions since 2000, amid expanded shale era output and growing public concern about climate and air quality impacts. Steadfast production industry opposition, rather than technical feasibility, emerges as the primary factor leading to rejection in these cases. Even when framing releases as a conventional air contaminant or as permanent loss of a nonrenewable natural resource, states largely continue to exempt flared or vented methane from severance taxes. © 2020 The Authors.

Annual avoided premature deaths driven by the average concentration of PM2.5 decrease were evaluated, and the economic benefits were computed by using the value of statistical life (VSL) method. Results showed that the number of avoided premature deaths in Wuhan are 21,384 (95% confidence interval (CI): 15,004 to 27,255) during 2013-2017, due to the implementation of the Air Improvement Action Plan. According to the VSL method, the obtained economic benefits of Huangpi, Wuchang, Hongshan, Xinzhou, Jiang’an, Hanyang, Jiangxia, Qiaokou, Jianghan, Qingshan, Caidian, Dongxihu, and Hannan District were 8.55, 8.19, 8.04, 7.39, 5.78, 4.84, 4.37, 4.04, 3.90, 3.30, 2.87, 2.42, and 0.66 billion RMB (1 RMB = 0.1417 USD On 14 October 2019), respectively. These economic benefits added up to 64.35 billion RMB (95% CI: 45.15 to 82.02 billion RMB), accounting for 4.80% (95% CI: 3.37% to 6.12%) of the total GDP ofWuhan in 2017. Therefore, in the process of formulating a regional air quality improvement scheme, apart from establishing hierarchical emission-reduction standards and policies, policy makers should give integrated consideration to the relationship between regional economic development, environmental protection and residents’ health benefits. Furthermore, for improving air quality, air quality compensation mechanisms can be established on the basis of the status quo and trends of air quality, population distribution, and economic development factors. © 2020 by the authors.

We aimed to assess the potential benefits in life expectancy by attaining the daily PM2.5 standards in 72 cities of China during 2013-2016. Methods and findings We applied a two-stage approach for the analysis. At the first stage, we used a generalized additive model (GAM) with a Gaussian link to examine the city-specific short-term association between daily PM2.5 and years of life lost (YLL); at the second stage, a random-effects meta-analysis was used to generate the regional and national estimations. We further estimated the potential gains in life expectancy (PGLE) by assuming that ambient PM2.5 has met the Chinese National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS, 75 μg/m3) or the ambient air quality guideline (AQG) of the World Health Organization (WHO) (25 μg/m3). We also calculated the attributable fraction (AF), which denoted the proportion of YLL attributable to a higher-than-standards daily mean PM2.5 concentration. During the period from January 18, 2013 to December 31, 2016, we recorded 1,226,849 nonaccidental deaths in the study area. We observed significant associations between daily PM2.5 and YLL: each 10 μg/m3 increase in three-day-averaged (lag02) PM2.5 concentrations corresponded to an increment of 0.43 years of life lost (95% CI: 0.29-0.57). We estimated that 168,065.18 (95% CI: 114,144.91-221,985.45) and 68,684.95 (95% CI: 46,648.79-90,721.11) years of life lost can be avoided by achieving WHO's AQG and Chinese NAAQS in the study area, which corresponded to 0.14 (95% CI: 0.09-0.18) and 0.06 (95% CI: 0.04-0.07) years of gain in life expectancy for each death in these cities. We observed differential regional estimates across the 7 regions, with the highest gains in the Northwest region (0.28 years of gain [95% CI: 0.06-0.49]) and the lowest in the North region (0.08 [95% CI: 0.02-0.15]). Furthermore using WHO's AQG and Chinese NAAQS as the references, we estimated that 1.00% (95% CI: 0.68%-1.32%) and 0.41% (95% CI: 0.28%-0.54%) of YLL could be attributable to the PM2.5 exposure at the national level. Findings from this study were mainly limited by the unavailability of data on individual PM2.5 exposure. Conclusions This study indicates that significantly longer life expectancy could be achieved by a reduction in the ambient PM2.5 concentrations. It also highlights the need to formulate a stricter ambient PM2.5 standard at both national and regional levels of China to protect the population's health. © 2020 Qi et al.

This is based on their role in maintaining soil fertility, which can instead be a source of greenhouse gas emissions if not managed properly, while threatening food security. Humid tropical conditions enable intensive agricultural cultivation with various cropping systems to fulfill the demand for agriculture products. Such climate accelerates the soil organic matter decomposition rate so that it strongly influences soil carbon and nitrogen dynamics. However, inappropriate implementation of intensive agricultural systems that does not consider the balance between carbon and nitrogen input and output, negatively affects soil fertility, mainly decreasing soil organic carbon and total soil nitrogen, changing the composition of carbon and nitrogen owing to the loss of soil organic matter through erosion and leaching, thus, causing soil degradation. Mitigation strategies can be performed by using organic matter and crop residue, crop rotation and improvement of crop pattern, soil tillage and fertilization, cover crops and mulch. Sustainable land management for maintenance of soil organic carbon and total soil nitrogen dynamics should be locally and globally developed and adopted for a more sustainable agricultural system. Recovery of soil capacity to accumulate carbon is a strategic step to reduce the impact of climate change. Hence, an intensive study on efficient soil organic carbon management is required to improve food production and mitigation of climate change to attain sustainable development goals in 2030. © 2019, © 2019 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.","crop rotation; decomposition of organic matter; Intensive agriculture; mitigation strategies; soil carbon and nitrogen fractions",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076930781

Globally, PM2.5 monitoring sites are limited in number, as they require extensive manpower and equipment to operate. Here, we take a physics-based approach to estimate PM2.5 from analysis of photographs at different locations. We develop a governing equation that relates camera signal to the properties of aerosol, the incident light, and the object being imaged. From inversion of this integral equation, we establish an expression for turbidity. Analyzing 3-years of images captured from a camera at a fixed location (downtown Chicago), we calculate turbidity and compare the values against PM2.5 values estimated from nearby EPA monitoring sites. Our calculated photograph-based turbidity values are seen to have a statistically significant positive linear correlation to the estimated PM2.5 values with p-value less than 0.01 and an average binned R2 greater than 0.50. We show that calculation of turbidity is possible from a single photograph, when it contains objects with the same albedo and that are identically illuminated. Our analysis suggests that camera-based PM monitoring could be a relatively low-cost, alternative approach to obtain global air quality data. © 2020 The Authors",,"Aerosols; Air quality; Cameras; Integral equations; Photography; Quality control; Turbidity; Aerosol particles; Air quality data; Governing equations; High resolution; Incident light; Linear correlation; Monitoring sites; Turbidity values; Image analysis; aerosol; air quality; albedo; particulate matter; photography; turbidity; aerosol; air quality; article; calculation; human; Illinois; photography; physics; turbidity; Chicago; Illinois; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079372401

Although there are numerous studies dealing with the association between extreme ambient temperature and mortality, only a small number adopt a synoptic climatological approach in order to understand the nature of weather systems that precipitate increases in cold- or heat-related mortality. In this paper, the Lamb Weather Type synoptic classification is used to examine the relationship between daily mortality and weather patterns across nine regions of England. Analysis results revealed that the population in England is more susceptible to cold weather. Furthermore, it was found that the Easterly weather types are the most hazardous for public health all-year-long; however, during the cold period, the results are more evident and spatially homogenous. Nevertheless, it is noteworthy that the most dangerous weather conditions are not always associated with extreme (high or low) temperatures, a finding which points to the complexity of weather-related health effects and highlights the importance of a synoptic climatological approach in elucidating the relationship between temperature and mortality. © 2019, ISB.","Atmospheric circulation; Easterly weather; Lamb Weather Types; Mortality; Synoptic climatology; Temperature","animal; cold; England; heat; meteorology; mortality; season; sheep; weather; Animals; Cold Temperature; England; Hot Temperature; Meteorology; Mortality; Seasons; Sheep; Weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074810759

Their contributions to increasing N2O emissions are greatest in terrestrial environments, due to the dramatic and continuing increases in use of ammonia-based fertilizers, which have been driven by requirement for increased food production, but which also provide a source of energy for ammonia oxidizers (AO), leading to an imbalance in the terrestrial nitrogen cycle. Direct N2O production by AO results from several metabolic processes, sometimes combined with abiotic reactions. Physiological characteristics, including mechanisms for N2O production, vary within and between ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB) and comammox bacteria and N2O yield of AOB is higher than in the other two groups. There is also strong evidence for niche differentiation between AOA and AOB with respect to environmental conditions in natural and engineered environments. In particular, AOA are favored by low soil pH and AOA and AOB are, respectively, favored by low rates of ammonium supply, equivalent to application of slow-release fertilizer, or high rates of supply, equivalent to addition of high concentrations of inorganic ammonium or urea. These differences between AOA and AOB provide the potential for better fertilization strategies that could both increase fertilizer use efficiency and reduce N2O emissions from agricultural soils. This article reviews research on the biochemistry, physiology and ecology of AO and discusses the consequences for AO communities subjected to different agricultural practices and the ways in which this knowledge, coupled with improved methods for characterizing communities, might lead to improved fertilizer use efficiency and mitigation of N2O emissions. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","agriculture; archaeal ammonia oxidizers; bacterial ammonia oxidizers; marine; nitrification; nitrous oxide emissions; soil","agriculture; ammonia; biochemistry; differentiation; niche; nitrification; nitrous oxide; physiological response; soil emission; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); ammonia; nitrous oxide; archaeon; microbiology; nitrification; oxidation reduction reaction; soil; Ammonia; Archaea; Nitrification; Nitrous Oxide; Oxidation-Reduction; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075725477

There are seven phases of development; Initiation, Existing Conditions, Guiding Principles, Evaluate Alternatives, Draft General Plan, Program Environmental Impact Report, and General Plan Adoption. Currently, the Phase Five is in process, involving the preparation, public review and Board of Supervisors (BOS) approval of a draft GPU. Phase Six, preparation of a draft program environmental impact report (PEIR), is also in process at this time. There are state incentives to include a Climate Action Plan (CAP) in county general plans. Due to the dire consequences predicted for life on earth because of the climate crisis, there has been considerable public interest in the development of the Climate Action Plan. Much of this interest has been from local climate-action environmental groups.

The polymer was structurally characterized by FTIR and 1H/13C/HSQC NMR techniques, and its average Mn (38.5 kDa) retrieved from GPC analysis. The polymer is highly emissive (ΦF = 0.55) and exhibits a longer-than-usual excited-state lifetime (1.80 ns) for a phenyleneethynylene type polymer. Similar photophysical properties (absorption and fluorescence emission) were observed in solution and in solid-state. This stems from the presence of bulky calixarene moieties along the polymer chains which prevent interchain staking and the formation of ground-state aggregates and/or non-emissive exciplexes, both deleterious to solid-state materials envisioned for fluorescence sensing applications. Moreover, the intrinsic molecular recognition capabilities of its two rigid inner cavities (calixarene and cyclophane sub-units), allied with the high three-dimensionality of the macromolecule that creates additional interstitial voids around the molecular receptors, can boost its sensory responses towards specific analytes. A high sensitive response was observed in the detection of nitroaromatics and nitroanilines in neat vapour phases by casted films of the polymer. The largest sensitivities were obtained for 2,4-dinitrotoluene (a taggant for the explosive TNT; &gt; 85% of fluorescence quenching upon 1 min exposure) and ortho-nitroaniline (90% of emission reduction in 30 s). The sensory responses attained in solid-state are discussed on the basis of the electron affinities of the analytes and their electrostatic interactions with polymer films.

Internal combustion engines (ICE) and industries are common sources of pollutants that aggravate this situation. Aiming to overcome this problem, increasingly restrictive legislation on combustion pollutant emissions has been formulated and new technologies are being developed to ensure compliance with such restrictions. In this scenario, the lean mixtures appear as a possible alternative, but also bring some inconveniences such as combustion instabilities. Pre-chamber ignition systems (PCIS) enable a more stable combustion process due to high kinetic, thermal and chemical energy of the gases from the pre-chamber (PC), which pass through nozzles and begin the combustion process of the air-fuel mixture contained in the main combustion chamber (MC). However, some challenges still have to be overcome in the development of these systems, one of the main ones being hydrocarbon (HC) emissions. Therefore, the main goal of this investigation is to evaluate the effect of operating temperature on the pollutants emissions from an ICE with stratified pre-chamber ignition system (SPCIS) and to verify specifically the possibility of HC emissions reduction by raising the operating temperature. So, an ICE equipped with a SPCIS, operating with indirect injection of ethanol in the MC and direct injection of hydrogen in the PC, was tested under lean conditions of λ = 1.4, at 2250 rpm and indicated mean effective pressure of 5 bar. With the increase in the operating temperature of the ICE from 70 °C to 100 °C, were observed emission reductions in percentage volume of 42.4% for HC and 20.4% for CO, while NOx emissions increased in 33.7%. These results allow to conclude that the increase in operating temperature is a viable alternative to achieve lower HC emission with PCIS. © 2019 SAE International.

We explore the potential of satellite remote sensing (S-RS) products-which have consistently high spatial and temporal resolution and nearly global coverage-to quantify species-environment relationships that predict species distributions. We propose several new environmental metrics that take advantage of high temporal resolution in S-RS data and compare these approaches to classic climate-only approaches using the live oaks (Quercus section Virentes) as a case study. We show that models perform similarly but for some species, particularly in understudied regions, show less precision in predicting spatial distribution. These results provide evidence supporting efforts to enhance environmental niche models and species distribution models (ENMs/SDMs) with S-RS data and, when combined with other approaches for species detection, will likely enhance our ability to monitor biodiversity globally. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s) 2020.","Abiotic niche; Biotic niche; Climate variables; Environmental niche models; Phenology; Remotely sensed environmental data; Species distribution models",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077679980

Nowadays, thanks to the development of reliable and efficient technologies, several possibilities exist to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources, such as wind power, solar, hydropower, geothermal, and biomass. In the Alpine region, biomass can play a key role for achieving the objectives foreseen by the EU policy strategy. In the last few years, due to the high available potentials of residues from forestry operations and sawmill processing, the Alpine region witnessed the development of centralized biomass district heating plants. The aim of the present study is to assess the environmental impacts of 18 biomass-based plants located in the Alpine region using a Life Cycle Assessment approach and to analyse the current market destination of the wood residues. The data were collected through face-to-face interviews with the stakeholders of the forest-wood supply chain (managers of biomass-based plant, sawmills, forest owners and enterprises). From the environmental point of view, the results of the Life Cycle Assessment (global climate change impact: 5–90 gCO2 MJ−1) show that the “critical points” in the forest-wood supply chain are: the transport phase (1–54 gCO2 MJ−1) and the wood processing phase (6–36 gCO2 MJ−1). The results provided by Life Cycle Assessment can be used to increase the scientific knowledge of the environmental impacts related to the biomass conversion technology and to underline the weak points of the forest-wood supply chain.

However, despite growing research interest, uncertainties remain on some fundamental issues, such as the contributions of different regions, constituent fluxes and climatic factors to carbon cycle IAV. Here we overviewed the literature on carbon cycle IAV about current understanding of these issues. Observations and models of the carbon cycle unanimously show the dominance of tropical land ecosystems to the signal of global carbon cycle IAV, where tropical semiarid ecosystems contribute as much as the combination of all other tropical ecosystems. Vegetation photosynthesis contributes more than ecosystem respiration to IAV of the global net land carbon flux, but large uncertainties remain on the contribution of fires and other disturbance fluxes. Climatic variations are the major drivers to the IAV of net land carbon flux. Although debate remains on whether the dominant driver is temperature or moisture variability, their interaction,that is, the dependence of carbon cycle sensitivity to temperature on moisture conditions, is emerging as key regulators of the carbon cycle IAV. On timescales from the interannual to the centennial, global carbon cycle variability will be increasingly contributed by northern land ecosystems and oceans. Therefore, both improving Earth system models (ESMs) with the progressive understanding on the fast processes manifested at interannual timescale and expanding carbon cycle observations at broader spatial and longer temporal scales are critical to better prediction on evolution of the carbon–climate system. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","carbon cycle; carbon–climate system; interaction of climatic factors; interannual variability; moisture; semiarid; temperature; terrestrial ecosystems","air temperature; annual variation; atmospheric moisture; carbon cycle; climate change; climate variation; semiarid region; terrestrial ecosystem; carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon cycle; ecosystem; photosynthesis; temperature; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Photosynthesis; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076155872

This long-standing question in climate science was recently analyzed by dynamic panel data methods using extensive spatio-temporal data of global surface temperatures, solar radiation, and GHG concentrations over the last half century to 2010 (Storelvmo et al, 2016). Those methods revealed that atmospheric aerosol effects masked approximately one-third of the continental warming due to increasing GHG concentrations over this period, thereby implying greater climate sensitivity to GHGs than previously thought. The present study provides regularity conditions and asymptotic theory justifying the use of time series cointegration-based methods of estimation when there are both stochastic process and deterministic trends in the global forcing variables, such as GHGs, and station-level trend effects from such sources as local aerosol pollutants. The asymptotics validate estimation and confidence interval construction for econometric measures of Earth's transient climate sensitivity (TCS). The methods are applied to observational data and to data generated from several groups of global climate models (GCMs) that are sampled spatio-temporally and aggregated in the same way as the empirical observations for the time period 1964–2005. The findings indicate that 7 out of 9 of the GCM reported TCS values lie within the 95% empirical confidence interval computed econometrically from the GCM output. The analysis shows the potential of econometric methods to provide empirical estimates and confidence limits for TCS, to calibrate GCM simulation output against observational data in terms of the implied TCS estimates obtained via the econometric model, and to reveal the respective sensitivity parameters (GHG and non-GHG related) governing GCM temperature trends. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate sensitivity; Cointegration; Common stochastic trend; Idiosyncratic trend; Spatio-temporal model; Unit root","Atmospheric aerosols; Greenhouse gases; Random processes; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Climate sensitivity; Cointegration; Idiosyncratic trend; Spatio-temporal models; Stochastic trends; Unit root; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066802233

As this chapter demonstrates, given insurance’s central economic role, the relationship between insurers and climate change is complicated and conflicted. After the discussion of insurers as shapers of climate risk (the first section of the chapter), this chapter explains how (in the second section) insurers are strongly implicated in creating climate change and attendant climate risk in the period since industrialisation through facilitating the accelerating fossil-fuel-based economic development and growth that causes climate change; this is the dominant dimension in insurers’ relationship with climate change. In the third section of this chapter, the authors review insurers’ responses over the past decade to increasing climate risk. Responses have been largely adaptive and aimed at increasing insurers’ capacity to accommodate the climate risks faced by their policyholders. Some responses have been ‘weakly mitigative’, meaning that they provide for some mitigation, but on a very limited scale, and largely as side effects of initiatives unrelated to climate change. In marked contrast, a very limited number of recent ‘divest and decline’ actions by insurance industry actors can be described as ‘strongly mitigative’, as described in the fourth section. The fifth section concludes the chapter with some remarks on the prospects for further strong mitigation action from insurers on climate change and their role as governors of security beyond the state. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Avi Brisman and Nigel South; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121569746

The photobioreactor is used for a microalgae photosynthetic growth process where some components with added value are produced, and bio-mitigation of the carbon dioxide emissions is achieved. By using realistic models of the anaerobic digester and of the photobioreactor, novel adaptive and robust control schemes are designed. These proposed structures contain linearizing controllers, state observers and parameter estimators for the bioprocess unknown kinetics.

Although biochar can approach carbon black in terms of carbon and ash content, substituting carbon black with biochar typically degrades the mechanical properties of rubber composites because of the much larger particle size of biochar. Biochar is produced from biomass and must be size reduced by “top-down” methods such as milling. Thus, biochar frequently has populations of particles greater than 10 µm in diameter, which greatly reduce reinforcement properties by introducing localized stresses in the rubber composite. In this work we explore using nanosilica as a co-milling material with biochar as a means to reduce its particle size and consequently improve its ability to replace carbon black as rubber composite filler. Biochar co-milled with 1 wt% nanosilica was able to replace 40% of the carbon black filler in a styrene–butadiene rubber composite with virtually no loss in tensile strength. Also, elongation and toughness properties of the optimal biochar substituted composites were improved by over 31 and 24%, respectively. © 2019, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply.","Biochar; Carbon black; Composite; Milling; Nanosilica; SBR; Tensile strength","Composite materials; Fillers; Milling (machining); Particle size; Reinforcement; Rubber; Styrene; Tensile strength; Bio chars; Butadiene rubber; Carbon black fillers; Larger particle sizes; Localized stress; Nano-silica; Renewable sources; Toughness properties; Carbon black; biochar; black carbon; composite; milling; nanocomposite; particle size; reinforcement; tensile strength",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075366423

OBJECTIVES: We examined changes in CV mortality attributed to reductions in emissions from mobile, point, areal, and nonroad sources through changes in concentrations of PM2:5 and its major components [nitrates, sulfates, elemental carbon (EC), and organic carbon (OC)] in 2,132 U.S. counties between 1990 and 2010. METHODS: Using Community Multiscale Air Quality model estimated PM2:5 total and component concentrations, we calculated population-weighted annual averages for each county. We estimated PM2:5 total-and component-related CV mortality, adjusted for county-level population characteristics and baseline PM2:5 concentrations. Using the index of Emission Mitigation Efficiency for primary emission-to-particle pathways, we expressed changes in particle-related mortality in terms of precursor emissions by each sector. RESULTS: PM2:5 reductions represented 5.7% of the overall decline in CV mortality. Large point source emissions of sulfur dioxide accounted for 6.685 [95% confidence interval (CI): 5.703, 7.667] fewer sulfate-related CV deaths per 100,000 people. Mobile source emissions of primary EC and nitrous oxides accounted for 3.396 (95% CI: 2.772, 4.020) and 3.984 (95% CI: 2.472, 5.496) fewer CV deaths per 100,000 people respectively. Increased EC and OC emissions from areal sources increased carbon-related CV mortality by 0.788 (95% CI: −0:540, 2.116) and 0.245 (95% CI: −0:697, 1.187) CV deaths per 100,000 people. DISCUSSION: In a nationwide epidemiological study of emission sector contribution to PM2:5 –related mortality, we found that reductions in sulfur-dioxide emissions from large point sources and nitrates and EC emissions from mobile sources contributed the largest reduction in particle-related mortality rates respectively. © 2020, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The mechanisms underlying the enhanced reactivity in alternate solvent environments and whether the enhanced reactivity due to nanoconfinement is a universal phenomenon are not fully understood. Here, we use ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to characterize the free energy of a retro-Diels-Alder reaction in bulk water at very different densities and in water nanoconfined by parallel graphene sheets. We find that the broadly different global solvation environments accelerate the reactions to a similar degree with respect to the gas-phase reaction, with activation free energies that do not differ by more than kbT from each other. The reason for the same acceleration factor in the extremely different solvation environments is that it is the microsolvation of the dienophile's carbonyl group that governs the transition-state stabilization and mechanism, which is not significantly disrupted by either the lower density in bulk water or the strong nanoconfinement conditions used here. Our results also suggest that significant acceleration of Diels-Alder reactions in microdroplets or on-water conditions cannot arise from local microsolvation when water is present but instead must come from highly altered reaction environments that drastically change the reaction mechanisms.

Through the implementation of a life cycle analysis (LCA) methodology (door-to-door and well-to-wheel approach), we examine the existing relationships between modal distribution, distances, travel times, urban structure, and direct and indirect carbon footprint and monetary costs of ULE users' commuting to its premises. Necessary primary information was collected by means of an online survey conducted on all ULE bodies and actors. Even though most distances traveled to the University are of &lt;6 km (94.3% of the commutes), the use of the private car is second in importance (34%) after traveling by foot (41.5%), as well as the main hotspot in environmental terms (95% of GHG emissions). The results show how university policies focused on improving mobility habits (greater use of bus, bicycle and walking) can considerably reduce GHG emissions within a distance range of 0–6 km. For instance, the replacement of cars with bicycles (50% in &lt;4 km distances) would reduce CO2-eq emissions by 17.5% and increase monetary savings by 14.8%. However, 5.8% of the remaining travels (&gt; 6 km) accumulate 49.4% of the emissions. Beyond that distance, behavior-oriented policies prove to be insufficient, and actions and measures at other levels encouraging technological change (use of electric cars and bicycles, etc.) and the improvement of infrastructures are also required.

Together with up-to-date observations and characterizations of Arctic ice state, they are essential to business strategic planning, climate adaptation, and risk mitigation. In this study, the monthly Arctic sea ice extents from 12 global climate models are utilized to obtain projected FIASYs and their dependency on different emission scenarios, as well as to examine the nature of the ice retreat projections. The average value of model-projected FIASYs is 2054/2042, with a spread of 74/42 years for the medium/high emission scenarios, respectively. The earliest FIASY is projected to occur in year 2023, which may not be realistic, for both scenarios. The sensitivity of individual climate models to scenarios in projecting FIASYs is very model-dependent. The nature of model-projected Arctic sea ice coverage changes is shown to be primarily linear. FIASY values predicted by six commonly used statistical models that were curve-fitted with the first 30 years of climate projections (2006-2035), on other hand, show a preferred range of 2030-2040, with a distinct peak at 2034 for both scenarios, which is more comparable with those from previous studies. © 2020 by the authors.","Arctic; Climate data record; Climate models; Coupled model intercomparison project; First ice-free arctic summer year; Sea ice extent",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078850637

Information on potential future changes in extreme climate events in Central Asia is limited. In this study, the performances of models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) in simulating climatological extremes in Central Asia are first evaluated, and a bias correction method is employed to constrain future projections. The responses of extreme climate events over Central Asia to future warming and, in particular, the impact of 1.5 and 2 °C global warming scenarios are then assessed based on the observationally constrained projections. During the twenty-first century, coldest night (TNn), coldest day (TXn), warmest night (TNx), warmest day (TXx), 1-day maximum precipitation (RX1 day), 5-day maximum precipitation (RX5 day), and precipitation intensity (SDII) in Central Asia would robustly increase at best estimated rates of 1.93 °C, 1.71 °C, 1.18 °C, 1.25 °C, 6.30%, 5.71%, and 4.99% per degree of global warming, respectively, under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. Compared with the 2 °C warming scenario, limiting global warming to 1.5 °C could reduce the intensification (relative to 1986–2005) of TNn, TNx, TXn, TXx, RX1 day, RX5 day, and SDII by 33%, 24%, 32%, 29%, 39%, 42%, and 53% from the best estimates under RCP8.5, respectively. The avoided intensification of TNn, TNx, TXn and TXx (RX1 day and SDII) would be larger (smaller) under RCP4.5. This suggests that a low warming target is necessary for avoiding the dangerous risk of extremes in this arid region. © 2019, The Author(s).","1.5 and 2 °C; Central Asia; Extreme events","climate change; CMIP; extreme event; future prospect; global warming; precipitation assessment; Central Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074821743

We used open-top chambers to artificially warm two different plant communities in Tibet from 2012 to 2016. We recorded species richness, vegetation height, and graminoid, forb, legume, and litter cover each year of the experiment and leaf growth and chemical traits of the most dominant species after four years of warming. Our results showed that vegetation height increased under warming in both the alpine meadow and the swamp. Warming also marginally increased legume cover and C:N ratio of all species in the alpine meadow but not in the swamp, suggesting that plant growth rate and nitrogen cycling are higher in the meadow in a warmer future. An observed tradeoff between water use efficiency and nitrogen use efficiency in the alpine meadow, but not in the swamp, also indicated that resource use may be more efficient in plants in the drier meadow under future warming. Overall, our results support predictions that soil moisture may modify plant community responses to climate warming and that changes in carbon and nutrient cycling may be more pronounced in drier alpine meadows than in wetter swamps under climate warming. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The materials are produced from buckwheat husk, which is a French local biomass. Slow pyrolysis was chosen to favor the production of raw chars. Activated chars were then prepared by physical activation under steam or CO2. The materials produced were physically and chemically characterized before being implemented in a fixed bed. The efficiency of materials in removing tar from syngas was studied, and ethylbenzene (EB) was chosen as the tar surrogate. The purification efficiency of the chars and AC was deduced from the EB conversion profiles in comparison with thermal cracking. The nature of the oxidizing agent impacted the porosity and mineral composition of the AC produced: CO2 activation produced ACs with more carbon and less ash content. This is because the reduction of carbon with carbon dioxide presents a kinetic between 2 and 5 times slower than that conducted in the presence of steam. CO2 activation also resulted in a higher relative microporosity (89%) than steam activation (61%), which itself gives a higher surface area. Pyrolysis char did not generate any interest for EB catalytic cracking, whereas ACs demonstrated higher performances. This is due to their higher level of porosity and higher ash content. BH–H2O, which presents higher porosity, produced a better catalytic effect and was more resistant to deactivation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Activated carbon; Chars; Physical activation; Pyrolysis; Tar cracking","Activated carbon; Carbon dioxide; Chemical activation; Coal tar; Crops; Efficiency; Oxidation; Porosity; Purification; Pyrolysis; Synthesis gas; Catalytic effects; Catalytic purification; Chars; Efficiency of materials; Mineral composition; Physical activation; Purification efficiency; Tar cracking; Catalytic cracking; activated carbon; carbon dioxide; catalysis; catalyst; crop residue; detection method; efficiency measurement; oxidation; purification; pyrolysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076213618

Low carbon fuels combined with new powertrain technologies have the potential to provide significant reductions in GHG emissions while decreasing the dependence on fossil fuel. In this study, a lean-burn ethanol-diesel dual-fuel combustion strategy has been used as means to improve upon the efficiency and emissions of a conventional diesel engine. Experiments have been performed on a 2.0 dm3 single cylinder heavy-duty engine equipped with port fuel injection of ethanol and a high-pressure common rail diesel injection system. Exhaust emissions and fuel consumption have been measured at a constant engine speed of 1200 rpm and various steady-state loads between 0.3 and 2.4 MPa net indicated mean effective pressure (IMEP). Compared to a baseline diesel-only operation, the ethanol-diesel dual-fuel engine yielded up to 57% lower well-to-wheels GHG emissions. Moreover, the dual-fuel combustion strategy attained higher net indicated efficiency than the conventional diesel mode from 0.6 to 2.4 MPa IMEP, with a maximum value of 47.2% at 1.2 MPa IMEP. The analysis also revealed that the use of ethanol resulted in 26% to 90% lower nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions than the conventional diesel operation. This was attributed to the formation of a more premixed and low temperature combustion process for a dual-fuel operation with an ethanol energy fraction that varied from 56% to 79%. Soot levels from the dual-fuel combustion were maintained comparatively low, with a filter smoke number of less than 0.235. Carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions, however, increased significantly in the dual-fuel combustion. This will likely require the application of a high efficiency oxidation catalyst. Overall, this experimental study demonstrated that a dual-fuel combustion with a low carbon fuel such as ethanol is an effective means of decreasing the dependence on diesel fuel and associated GHG emissions. © 2019 SAE International.

This mixed methods study aims to explore sustainable livestock intensification options that reduce agro-environmental trade-offs across different smallholder farming systems in Northern Tanzania. A smallholder livestock systems typology was constructed, and representative farms simulated with a whole farm multi-objective optimization model. Livestock contributed more than 90% of on-farm GHG emissions, and DAIRY had the lowest GHG emission intensity (2.1 kg CO2e kg−1 milk). All livestock systems had alternative options available to reduce agro-environmental trade-offs, including reducing ruminant numbers, replacing local cattle with improved dairy breeds, improving feeding through on-farm forage cultivation, and minimizing crop residue feeding. Three obstacles to adoption of these technologies became apparent: they require a skillful re-organization of the entire production system, result in loss of some multi-functionality of livestock, and incur higher production risks. Sustainable livestock intensification can be a key building block to Tanzania's climate-smart agriculture portfolio, providing synergies between productivity and income increases, and climate change mitigation as co-benefit. A better understanding of the institutional settings, incentives and coordination between stakeholders is needed to sustainably transform the livestock sector. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Microorganisms are primary agents in wood decomposition. The aim of the present research is to describe the changes in diversity, structure and abundance of microbial communities over downy birch lying deadwood decomposition in a boreal forest under natural conditions. This study also included investigations on the potential involvement of deadwood in climate change. The decomposition of deadwood was visually assessed using a five-class system. The microbial community diversity and composition were assessed with polymerase chain reaction-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) fingerprinting. Real time PCR was used to evaluate the absolute and relative microbial abundance. The potential involvement of deadwood in climate change was assessed by in situ-measuring of the carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from downy birch lying deadwood and from soil. The results obtained indicate that deadwood represents a substrate whose physico-chemical and microbiological property change with time. Higher diversity of fungi, bacteria, and archaea were recorded in the decay class 5. Conversely, actinobacteria showed the lowest values of diversity in decay class 5. We observed a succession of dominant microbial taxa over the decomposition progress. Overall, the abundance of each microbial group increases with the advance of decomposition. Among the estimated physico-chemical properties, nitrogen content, that increased with decay, and pH were the most important candidate drivers of microbial community composition and abundance. CO2 emissions were recorded higher in the decay class 5 and in soil of plots with the highest amount of lying deadwood. Bacteria dominated the microbial community and may play a more important role in the late stages of wood decomposition conversely to fungi and actinobacteria that are assumed to be primary involved in early stages of wood colonization. Archaea are shown to be an integral and dynamic component of decaying wood biota. The presence of large amounts of deadwood may affect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, especially in the event of an increase in temperatures that could reduce the carbon (C) sink capacity of the boreal forests. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Deadwood; Decay classes; Khibiny Mountains; Microbial abundance; Microbial diversity","Bacteria; Carbon dioxide; Decay (organic); Ecosystems; Electrophoresis; Forestry; Fungi; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; pH; Polymerase chain reaction; Soils; Wood; Deadwood; Decay class; Khibiny Mountains; Microbial abundances; Microbial diversity; Climate change; bacterium; boreal forest; carbon emission; carbon sink; climate change; community composition; dead wood; deciduous forest; deciduous tree; decomposition; fungus; microbial community; prokaryote; Bacteria; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystems; Electrophoresis; Forestry; Fungi; Khibiny Massif; Kola Peninsula; Murmansk [Russian Federation]; Russian Federation; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Betula pubescens; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074698021

The complexity of climate change's likely impacts, such as increased flooding, has widened the scope of information necessary to take action. This is particularly the case in valuable low-lying coastal regions, which host many competing interests, and where there is a growing need to draw from varied fields in the risk-based management of flooding. The rising scrutiny over science's ability to match expectations of policy actors has called for the integration of stakeholder and scientific knowledge domains. Focusing on the Broads — the United Kingdom's largest protected wetland — this study looked to assess future flood risk and consider potential adaptation responses in a collaborative approach. Interviews and surveys with local stakeholders accompanied the development of a hydraulic model in an iterative participatory design, centred on a scientist-stakeholder workshop.

There are several initiatives that are providing solutions to foster and accelerate the improvement of the EE in buildings. In particular, in the framework of the Interreg MED Programme, the Efficient Buildings Community (EB Community) has been created by the MEDNICE project (https://efficient-buildings.interreg-med.eu/) with the objective of sharing knowledge, practices and solutions for energy challenges in the MED area and creating synergies between similar initiatives. The EB Community collects the results of 10 Modular Projects (MPs) focused on the improvement of the EE in public buildings (PBs), in order to harmonize, systematize and capitalize their results and produce technical and policy recommendations to remove administrative, financial, legal or technological obstacles. The EB Community brings together local, regional and national stakeholders to exchanges methodologies, experiences and tools. The MPs cover the improvement of EE in PBs from different perspectives and stages: characterization of the PB stock, planning, tendering and procurement of services, implementation of the building process, monitoring and use of the buildings, training and awareness of the different stakeholders and financing solutions. Most of the MPs have proposed methodologies to carry out the different stages of the EE projects, from a public administration (PA) point of view and providing tools and indicators to make decisions in each stage of the project. The purpose of the present paper is to make a review of the methodologies and tools proposed by the MPs. The study aims at establishing a common procedure to perform EE projects in PBs with especial focus on MED areas; selecting common and relevant KPIs to be used during the whole value-chain of a project (energy, sustainability, cost and financial, environmental comfort, among others); evaluating the main target group of each tool and the stage of the process that is addressed; and identifying the main gaps of the methodologies and tools, as well as their usefulness to overcome the main barriers identified within the EE projects. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Buildings; Climate change; Finance; Public administration; Sustainable development; Building process; Different stages; Efficient buildings; Environmental comfort; Modular projects; Policy recommendations; Public buildings; Sharing knowledge; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079634429

This study determined how CIS use by men and women farmers may be influenced by their perceptions about climate change (CC), farm activities, and demography. The study was carried out at the Lawra-Jirapa Districts of the Upper West Region of Ghana where downscaled seasonal forecast information through mobile phone technologies (Esoko platform) had been disseminated to farmers since 2011. Data was collected from semi-structured questionnaire interviews involving 900 farmers (50.2% women and 49.8% men) and four 20-member focus group discussions. The study confirmed 85.2% (representing 767) farmers were aware of climate change and its implications for their agriculture and other livelihood activities. Men and women had similar perceptions about climate change, perceived by the majority as increased strong winds, higher temperatures, increased frequency of drought, increased rainfall variability and increased flooding. Among other factors, it was evident that use of CIS may be influenced by gender. Men were found to be particularly responsive in adopting CIS use for climate risk mitigation. This was attributed to their ability to easily access and use telephone devices compared with women. The study revealed that unlike women, men were able to access more financial resources and had control of household income which allowed them to purchase mobile phones. Women generally accessed their husbands’ mobile phones. Despite differences in access to CIS, the study showed both men and women found it beneficial for strategic farm decision-making such as when to begin land preparation, when to plant, and which crop to select. In addition, both men and women were found to face similar constrains (such as poor network connectivity and limited of training), to accessing and using CIS through the Esoko platform. The study recommends the need to explore different CIS dissemination channels and design CIS that meet gender-specific needs. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"Agriculture; Cellular telephones; Decision making; Information services; Information use; Risk management; Surveys; Climate information; Financial resources; Household income; Mobile phone technology; Network connectivity; Rainfall variability; Risk mitigation; Seasonal forecasts; Climate change; climate change; design method; downscaling; gender role; household income; livelihood; mobile phone; precipitation intensity; questionnaire survey; risk assessment; seasonality; Ghana; Lawra; Upper West Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049579478

On net these policies lose a small amount of revenue (0.05% of EU GDP). A series of reforms progressively extending emissions pricing across sectors and countries reduces costs by about 0.6% of 2030 EU GDP, or €90 per ton of CO2 reduced, while increasing revenues by almost 1% of EU GDP.

For example, many tree and liana species adapted to seasonal drought are more abundant and diverse in seasonally-dry forests, characterized by long periods of seasonal water deficit. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) is commonly used to explain plant distributions across climate gradients. However, the relationship between MAP and plant distribution is often weak, raising the question of whether other seasonal precipitation patterns better explain plant distributions in seasonally-dry forests. In this study, we examine the relationship between liana abundance and multiple metrics of seasonal and annual rainfall distribution to test the hypothesis that liana density and diversity increase with increasing seasonal drought along a rainfall gradient across the isthmus of Panama. We found that a normalized seasonality index, which combines MAP and the variability of monthly rainfall throughout the year, was a significant predictor of both liana density and species richness, whereas MAP, rainfall seasonality and the mean dry season precipitation (MDP) were far weaker predictors. The strong response of lianas to the normalized seasonality index indicates that, in addition to the total annual amount of rainfall, how rainfall is distributed throughout the year is an important determinant of the hydrological conditions that favor liana proliferation. Our findings imply that changes in annual rainfall and rainfall seasonality will determine the future distribution and abundance of lianas. Models that aim to predict future plant diversity, distribution, and abundance may need to move beyond MAP to a more detailed understanding of rainfall variability at sub-annual timescales. © 2019 The Authors.

In a global context where currently some countries have legally binding policies to reduce greenhouse gas emission and other countries do not-i.e., differentiated global carbon policies-the potential exists that countries imposing carbon control policies will find themselves at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis countries without comparable policies. The risks accompanying establishment of carbon control policies, in the absence of similar policies among competing nations, have been central to debates on whether the United States should enact greenhouse gas legislation. Specifically, concerns have been raised that if the United States adopts a carbon control policy, industries that must control their emissions or that find their feedstock or energy bills rising because of costs passed-through by suppliers may be less competitive and may lose global market share (and jobs) to competitors in countries lacking comparable carbon policies. In addition, this potential shift in production could result in some of the U.S. carbon reductions being counteracted by increased production in less regulated countries (commonly known as “carbon leakage”). There are three basic approaches, which are not mutually exclusive, to assist greenhouse gas- intensive, trade-exposed industries: (1) directly supporting domestic industries; (2) penalizing foreign competitors; and (3) developing alternative sectoral approaches. Importantly, these are presumably transitional actions, pending some international agreement that “levels the playing field.” Each approach has its own focus. Support for domestic industries, embodied in most legislative proposals, is focused on preserving the industry’s current competitive position and jobs and may, depending on the details, help transition that industry to the future. It does not directly promote an international agreement. Trade measures levied against foreign competitors, another approach being proposed, may provide a stick for international negotiation, but the primary focus is on protecting greenhouse gas-intensive, trade-exposed industries from “unfair” competition- producers in countries not imposing comparable carbon control policies. Finally, the sectoral approach represents a range of options focused on integrating developing countries’ industrial base into a mutually acceptable international framework that provides a level playing field for all participants. Whether any of these approaches would have any appreciable effect on carbon leakage is unclear. The design of an assistance program-the goals, eligible participants, implementation and enforcement-would be difficult to define in a manner that satisfies all parties. There is every incentive for any industry facing a cost increase from carbon policies to claim that its competitive position could be diminished, thereby justifying special consideration by the government. The government would be in the difficult position of picking winners and losers, sometimes without access to important, but proprietary, data. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096279587

While studies have found little effect of carbon policies on EU competitiveness in the present, the EU decision to move toward auctioning of allowances in the future has spurred development of criteria to extend potential availability of free allowances to exposed industries to 2020. In a December 2009 decision, the European Commission (EC) listed 164 industrial sectors and subsectors deemed exposed sectors under appropriate European Parliament and Council directives. H.R. 2454, which passed the House on June 26, 2009, includes two strategies to address these concerns: (1) free allocation of allowances (similar to that of the EU), and (2) an international reserve allowance (IRA) scheme. Studies have suggested that a free allowance scheme appears effective in mitigating the trade-related impact of the carbon program on energy-intensive, trade- exposed industries. However, production cost for those industries (along with other industries) could increase because of the potential pass-through of compliance-related costs by upstream producers of various inputs into their manufacturing processes. Whether these costs would become significant would depend on the ability of upstream suppliers to pass on the costs, and the ability of the downstream industries to respond by increasing the efficiency of their operations or by substituting other, less-costly inputs into their processes. There are questions about whether the allowances provided by H.R. 2454‘s allocation scheme are sufficient. If the Environmental Protection Agency’s estimates are correct, the allocation would appear sufficient. If industry estimates are correct, or if individual showings of eligibility prove significant, the pool of allowances provided by the bill would appear inadequate under the assumptions used here. Also, the data and administrative resources necessary to implement the program would be substantial. Although H.R. 2454 as passed would require EPA to establish an IRA program consistent with U.S. international agreements, questions may be raised as to whether proposed Part IV and its application would fully comply with U.S. international trade obligations. The distribution of free allowances may constitute actionable subsidies for purposes of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Subsidies and Countervailing Measures by possibly qualifying as “foregone revenue” when auctioning of allowances would also be permitted. In addition, the requirement that importers purchase IRAs to accompany particular imports might be found to constitute a prohibited import surcharge or, if the product may not otherwise enter the United States, a prohibited quantitative restriction under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) 1994. While the IRA program might be provisionally justified under GATT general exceptions for health protection or resource conservation, the GATT also requires that it not be applied “in a manner that would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail, or a disguised restriction on international trade.” Whether an IRA program can be applied consistently with these requirements may depend on the type of program that may be crafted by EPA under the proposed legislation-that is, on the elements that would be required under the bill and the administrative possibilities inherent in its discretionary authorities. Absent an international consensus on the types of trade-related measures that may be applied as part of a domestic climate change regime, adversely affected countries may seek to challenge these measures under WTO dispute settlement provisions. Since neither the distribution of emission allowances nor border restrictions imposed as part of a domestic greenhouse gas-reduction program have yet come before WTO dispute settlement panels, WTO obligations and exceptions remain untested in this complex regulatory environment. © 2011 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096275815

Our data document the origin and transformations of volatiles feeding gas emissions previously documented in this region. Gas hydrates are present where a fracture network beneath the pockmark focusses migration of thermogenic hydrocarbons characterized by their C1/C2+ and stable isotopic compositions (δ2H-CH4, δ13C-CH4). Measured geothermal gradients (~80 °C/km) and known formation temperatures (&gt;70 °C) suggest that those hydrocarbons are formed at depths &gt;800 mbsf. A combined analytical/modeling approach, including concentration and isotopic mass balances, reveals that pockmark sediments experience diffuse migration of thermogenic hydrocarbons. However, at sites without channeled flow this appears to be limited to depths &gt;~50 mbsf. At all sites we document a contribution of microbial methanogenesis to the overall carbon cycle that includes a component of secondary carbonate reduction—that is, reduction of dissolved inorganic carbon generated by anaerobic oxidation of methane in the uppermost methanogenic zone. Anaerobic oxidation of methane and carbonate reduction rates are spatially variable within the pockmark and are highest at high-flux sites. These reactions are revealed by 13C depletions of dissolved inorganic carbon at the sulfate-methane interface at all sites. However, 13C depletions of CH4 are only observed at the low methane flux sites because changes in the isotopic composition of the overall methane pool are masked at high-flux sites. 13C depletions of total organic carbon suggest that at seeps sites, methane-derived carbon is incorporated into de novo synthesized biomass. ©2019.

Global pollution trends, plant physiological responses and ecological perspectives in natural and agricultural systems are all discussed. In particular, we highlight the importance of studying sequential or simultaneous exposure of plants to pollutants, rather than exposure to individual pollutants in isolation, and explore how these responses may interfere with the way plants interact with their biotic community. Air pollutants can alter the normal physiology and metabolic functioning of plants. Here we describe how the phenotypic and molecular changes in response to multiple pollutants can differ compared to those elicited by single pollutants, and how different responses have been observed between plants in the field and in controlled laboratory conditions and between trees and crop plants. From an ecological perspective, we discuss how air pollution can result in greater susceptibility to biotic stressors and in direct or indirect effects on interactions with organisms that occupy higher trophic levels. Finally, we provide an overview of the potential uses of plants to mitigate air pollution, exploring the feasibility for pollution removal via the processes of bio-accumulation and phytoremediation.

Moreover, it can be considered as a valuable tool for the optimum selection of materials, systems and design decisions, regarding not only the improve of a structure's performance, but also in terms of reducing its carbon footprint during its life cycle. The study attempts to present the integration of BIM into the national legislation of European Member States, with a special focus on the energy related aspects of BIM analysis. This study performs an overview of the introduction of BIM into different aspects and requirements of the EU Member States building practices, through a comprehensive literature and legislation review of relative legislative documents of the construction sector. According to the findings of this overview study, the concept of BIM has already been incorporated in many aspects of the Acquis of EU Member States, which is recognized as a valuable tool to be exploited by the construction sector, however there is still room for development in this area. The study has revealed that especially in the energy assessment of the built environment, BIM applications are still lacking from the European Legislation. Examples and good practices of employing BIM for the implementation of the European Energy targets in the building sector are also presented and discussed. The findings of this study aim to shed light on the needs and requirements in the field of BIM development for the construction sector, as well as to indicate gaps and weaknesses of the European Member States Acquis towards harmonizing with BIM practices. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon footprint; Climate change; Construction; Construction industry; Laws and legislation; Life cycle; Sustainable development; Amount of information; Building Information Modelling; Building practices; Construction projects; Construction sectors; European legislation; National legislation; Optimum selection; Architectural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079587932

Optimisation of performance, from the perspectives of environmental, social and economic sustainability and resource efficiency, is essential to successful development and operation of biomass value chains. The complexity of value chains, which comprise interrelated stages from land use to conversion and multiple end products, presents challenges. To date, decision makers have approached from the viewpoints of single market sectors or issues, such as market shares of bioeconomy and reduction of carbon emissions to mitigate climate change. This approach does not achieve a full understanding of value chains and their competitive priorities, limits consumer awareness, and poses risks of sub-optimal performance and under-development of potential local capacity. This paper presents a conceptual framework that combines value chain analysis and competitive priority theory with indicators suitable to measure, monitor and interpret sustainability and resource efficiency at value chain level. The case of biomass Combined Heat and Power (CHP) is used to illustrate how optimisation strategies can be focused to address challenges in value chain stages which will lead to better performance and uptake of sustainably sourced, widely accepted biomass options. © 2020 The Authors","Biomass; Biomass CHP; Competitive priorities; Indicators; Value chain",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100603864

PM chemically speciated data from 12 European paired monitoring sites (one traffic, five urban, five regional and one continental background) were analysed by positive matrix factorisation (PMF) and Lenschow's approach to assign measured PM and source contributions to the different spatial levels. Five common sources were obtained at the 12 sites: sulfate-rich (SSA) and nitrate-rich (NSA) aerosols, road traffic (RT), mineral matter (MM), and aged sea salt (SS). These sources explained from 55 % to 88 % of PM mass at urban low-traffic-impact sites (UB) depending on the country. Three additional common sources were identified at a subset of sites/countries, namely biomass burning (BB) (FR, CH and DE), explaining an additional 9 %-13 % of PM mass, and residual oil combustion (V-Ni) and primary industrial (IND) (NL and ES), together explaining an additional 11 %-15 % of PM mass. In all countries, the majority of PM measured at UB sites was of a regional+continental (R+C) nature (64 %-74 %). The R+C PM increments due to anthropogenic emissions in DE, NL, CH, ES and FR represented around 66 %, 62 %, 52 %, 32 % and 23 %, respectively, of UB PM mass. Overall, the R+C PM increments due to natural and anthropogenic sources showed opposite seasonal profiles with the former increasing in summer and the latter increasing in winter, even if exceptions were observed. In ES, the anthropogenic R+C PM increment was higher in summer due to high contributions from regional SSA and V-Ni sources, both being mostly related to maritime shipping emissions at the Spanish sites. Conversely, in the other countries, higher anthropogenic R+C PM increments in winter were mostly due to high contributions from NSA and BB regional sources during the cold season. On annual average, the sources showing higher R+C increments were SSA (77 %-91 % of SSA source contribution at the urban level), NSA (51 %-94 %), MM (58 %-80 %), BB (42 %-78 %) and IND (91 % in NL). Other sources showing high R+C increments were photochemistry and coal combustion (97 %-99 %; identified only in DE). The highest regional SSA increment was observed in ES, especially in summer, and was related to ship emissions, enhanced photochemistry and peculiar meteorological patterns of the Western Mediterranean. The highest R+C and urban NSA increments were observed in NL and associated with high availability of precursors such as NOx and NH3. Conversely, on average, the sources showing higher local increments were RT (62 %-90 % at all sites) and V-Ni (65 %-80 % in ES and NL). The relationship between SSA and V-Ni indicated that the contribution of ship emissions to the local sulfate concentrations in NL has strongly decreased since 2007 thanks to the shift from high-sulfur-to low-sulfur-content fuel used by ships. An improvement of air quality in the five cities included here could be achieved by further reducing local (urban) emissions of PM, NOx and NH3 (from both traffic and non-traffic sources) but also SO2 and PM (from maritime ships and ports) and giving high relevance to non-urban contributions by further reducing emissions of SO2 (maritime shipping) and NH3 (agriculture) and those from industry, regional BB sources and coal combustion. © 2020 Copernicus GmbH.

If this is the case, can we assume that all green spaces are synonymous to augmenting happiness? Biodiversity is expressed in terms of a system having number and abundance of different species. For resilience of various ecosystem services like food production, climate regulation, and pest management to take place, prevalence of such biodiversity is essential which can substantially contribute to sustained human well-being. In this study, we assessed the status of agrobiodiversity and subjective well-being of an indigenous community amidst the transition from shifting cultivation (SC) to monoculture of natural rubber (NR). Sampling the respondents from 18 villages of Dhalai, Tripura, a remotely located district in northeast India and bordered by Bangladesh, we used mixed methods research for in depth investigation. Findings revealed that in the SC landscape of study area, the cultivated crop species and livestock breeds were being largely replaced by encroachment from rubber plantation. We documented only 19 crop species on such a landscape which is otherwise known for its vast agrobiodiversity in the tropics. This kind of transition from SC to NR which is usually supported by the government development interventions, has severely affected the ecosystem services of such landscapes and banishing happiness from the indigenous communities, as perceived by them. Hence stabilization of rich agrobiodiversity and simultaneously ensuring the peoples' well-being is the only potential alternative for development in the region. © 2020 Indian Academy of Sciences.","Agrobiodiversity; Indigenous community; Northeast India; Rubber plantation; Shifting cultivation landscape",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079173975

This study for the first time reports an experimental observation of significantly boosting the catalytic activity of tin nanoparticle catalysts by an external magnetic field for electrocatalytic CO2 reduction to formate/formic acid. We reveal that enhancing the amount of singlet radical pairs via magnetic field-facilitated triplet → singlet spin evolution can significantly increase the catalytic activity toward an efficient overall electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction. When a common Sn nanoparticle electrode was used as an example, in a constant applied magnetic field (about 0.9 T), the yield of formic acid can be nearly doubled compared to that of zero magnetic field. This finding suggests the merits of radical pair spin states in the electron-transfer process and paves the way toward high formate production in electrocatalytic reduction of CO2. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalyst activity; Electron transport properties; Free radical reactions; Magnetic fields; Nanocatalysts; Nanoparticles; Spin dynamics; Applied magnetic fields; Electrocatalytic; Electrocatalytic reduction; Electron transfer process; External magnetic field; Sn nanoparticles; TiN nanoparticles; Zero magnetic fields; Nanomagnetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076823845

CO2 emissions were calculated based on the mode used in each segment of commuting and distance travelled. The relationship between commuting CO2 emissions and demographic characteristics, transit proximity, built environment as well as car ownership was also established. The availability of rail transit has an impact on people's mode choice in commuting. But there is also the case that CO2 emissions from people living in areas close to rail transit surpass the emissions from people residing far away.

Therefore, energy demand reduction through conservation voltage reduction (CVR) scheme can play a prominent role in such concerns because a major share of energy demand in developing countries is still met by conventional coal/fuel-based power plants. Moreover, it does not require the participation of consumers to achieve energy saving, unlike in demand side management. Therefore, in this paper, a coordinated scheme comprising multiple voltage-regulated devices such as on-load tap changer (OLTC) transformer and switched capacitor banks (SCBs) including distribution network reconfiguration (DNR) operation for CVR has been proposed with minimum operating cost in distribution system. In addition, the impact of a flexible power electronic device called soft open point (SOP) has been investigated during CVR operation. The objective function of the proposed coordinated CVR scheme is to minimize the operating cost, which include the energy demand cost, switching operating cost of OLTC, SCBs, and remote-controlled switches (RCSs), carbon emission cost, and operating and maintenance costs of SOP, while satisfying the system operational constraints. Further, the impact of high penetration of photovoltaic (PV) distributed generation on the proposed coordinated scheme has been studied. Besides, local reactive power voltage (Q-V) control strategy of the SOP inverter has been proposed to mitigate voltage violations during cloudy day conditions. The present optimization problem has been solved using modified binary grey wolf optimization (MBGWO) algorithm. The performance of the proposed scheme has also been verified considering the forecast errors in PV generation and load demand. The proposed coordinated CVR scheme has been implemented on a modified 69-bus distribution system. The test results demonstrate the significance of the coordinated scheme for the minimization of daily operating cost. The comparative study reveals that the combined impacts of CVR, DNR, and SOP are more beneficial than that of either CVR, DNR, or SOP operation. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","distribution network reconfiguration; energy demand reduction; soft open point; volt-VAR control","Developing countries; Electric power systems; Electric utilities; Energy conservation; Greenhouse gases; Operating costs; Photovoltaic cells; Remote control; Voltage control; Conservation voltage reductions; Distribution network reconfiguration; Energy demands; Network re-configuration; On-load tap changer transformers; soft open point; Switched capacitor banks; Volt vars; Energy management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070241465

The ‘Long-range Energy Alternative Planning’ modelling platform is used to simulate the impact of energy and climate policies set in the context of the global low-carbon transition on North Africa’s current energy system and economies. Two scenarios are developed: the reference and the Intended Nationally Determined Contribution scenarios. A cost–benefit analysis is performed to ensure this transition can be cost-effective and to suggest recommendations for an efficient and effective transition to a low carbon economy. Results show that decarbonization in North Africa can be achieved at the regional scale, at negative costs, but significant upfront capital investments and intensive energy policy reforms are needed. Key policy insights In order for North African countries to meet their Paris Agreement commitments, further steps need to be taken by the international community to accelerate low-carbon technology transfer and the provision of financial resources to them. Policies for energy efficiency and renewable energy development should include the establishment of a regional market to develop and harmonize policies and legal frameworks in North Africa.

MSW production volumes were determined from information reported by public sanitation service providers, while their lower calorific value was estimated from a predictive model referenced in the literature. The results of the study indicate that the development of these technologies, in the three cities mentioned, would allow to contribute 2.309 GWh/year, corresponding to approximately 3,3% of the electricity demand in Colombia; likewise, they would reduce CO2 emissions by more than 3 million tons per year, compared to the emissions generated by the final disposal of waste in sanitary landfills. The plant located in the city of Bogota would have the best financial performance, with an internal rate of return of 7,1%, while the infrastructure located in the cities of Cartagena and Manizales would not have an interesting financial performance; under the assumptions raised in the study. © 2020, Chulalongkorn University, Faculty of Fine and Applied Arts.

Ocean acidification-related changes to the marine carbonate system can disturb ecosystems and hinder calcification by some organisms. Here, we use the calcification response of planktonic foraminifera as a tool to reconstruct the progression of ocean acidification in the California Current Ecosystem through the twentieth century. Measurements of nearly 2,000 fossil foraminifera shell weights and areas preserved in a marine sediment core showed a 20% reduction in calcification by a surface-dwelling foraminifera species. Using modern calibrations, this response translates to an estimated 35% reduction in carbonate ion concentration, a biologically important chemical component of the carbonate system. Assuming other aspects of the carbonate system, this represents a 0.21 decline in pH, exceeding the estimated global average decline by more than a factor of two. Our proxy record also shows considerable variability that is significantly correlated with Pacific Decadal Oscillation and decadal-scale changes in upwelling strength, a relationship that until now has been obscured by the relatively short observational record. This modulation suggests that climatic variations will play an important role in amplifying or alleviating the anthropogenic signal and progression of ocean acidification in this region. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",,"aquatic organism; calcification; carbonate system; decadal variation; foraminifera; fossil record; global ocean; marine sediment; ocean acidification; Pacific Decadal Oscillation; planktonic foraminifera; sediment core; twentieth century; upwelling; California; California Current; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean; United States; Foraminifera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076895219

Wetlands are epoch-making reproducing and nourishing zones for wildlife and give shelters and protection for sea creatures. As with any natural habitat, wetlands are important in supporting species diversity as well as providing the climate moderating element. This study aimed at appraising the spatial pattern of the Isimangaliso Wetland, the potential determinants and effects of the wetland depletion between 1987 and 2017 using remote sensing and GIS approach. Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images acquired for 1987, 1997, 2007 and Landsat 8 Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) and Operational Land Imager (OLI) imagery for 2017 was acquired from the archives of United States Geological Survey (USGS) for the analysis using ArcGIS 10.2. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) analyses between 1987 and 2017 successfully revealed the significant depletion of the water surrounding IW area which might be as a result of natural or human activities which may include climate change, built-up areas and agricultural activities. In 1987 and 2017, the results showed that wetland extent was 655.416 Km2 and 429.489 Km2 respectively which connotes that IW has witnessed significant changes during the study period over the area. It was also revealed that the other land features (vegetation, built-up, open surface and rocky surface) over the area increased from 2149.911 Km2 to 2375.838 Km2 in 1987 and 2017 respectively. The overall classification accuracy of 97.55% and Kappa coefficient of 0.941. This wetland depletion might have a significant impact on biodiversity including human and animals as well as plants thus diminishing its world heritage status. Consequently, this natural gift needs to be conserved to create a livable environment for wetland animals in order to moderate local climate as well as preserve human wellness and protection by reducing flood disaster and maintaining efficient water quantity and quality in the area. © 2018 The Authors","Biodiversity; Conservation; Geospatial analysis; Wetland depletion; Wetland dynamics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044148117

In June 2017, President Donald Trump publicly declared the U.S. intention to withdraw from further participating in the multilateral Paris Agreement. To keen followers and analysts of the U.S. climate policy beyond its borders, such unilateral action was never a surprise. Rather, it is nostalgic of the experience of the Kyoto Protocol, particularly how more or less similar move unduly prolonged the global climate negotiations up till late 2015 when the Paris Agreement came about. Although the Paris Agreement is remarkable as it represents the first states-wide climate deal, it however left a number of issues unresolved. Notable among which is climate finance which has remained the most contentious and of critical concern to developing countries, particularly in Africa. Pitted against the fact that Africa contributes less to climate change and, ironically, the hardest-hit by the phenomenon, the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement aggravates concerns around climate finance and, indeed, portends additional burdens for a continent that is still struggling to cope with the untoward fallout of climate change. © 2019, © 2019 African Studies Association of India, New Delhi.","Climate change; climate finance; complex interdependence; Kyoto Protocol; Paris Agreement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074721874

Methodological improvements are then required urgently because of increased reports of cases with discrepancies between results of the measured biomarker carboxyhemoglobin (COHb) and reported symptoms. Total blood CO (TBCO) measured chromatographically was thus proposed in a previous study as alternative biomarker to COHb. This approach was investigated in this study by comparing the two biomarkers and assessing the effects of various storage parameters (temperature, preservative, time, tube headspace (HS) volume, initial saturation level, freeze- and thaw- and reopening-cycles) over a period of one month. Results show that while for TBCO, concentrations are relatively stable over the observation period regardless of parameters such as temperature, time and HS volume, for COHb, concentrations are altered significantly during storage. Therefore, the use of TBCO as alternative biomarker for CO poisonings has been proposed, since it provides more valid results and is more stable even under non-optimal storage conditions. Additionally, it can be used to predict COHb in cases where sample degradation hinders optical measurement. Furthermore, a correction formula for COHb and TBCO is provided to be used in laboratories or circumstances where optimal storage or analysis is not possible, to obtain more accurate results. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Blood analysis; Carbon monoxide poisoning; Carboxyhemoglobin; COHb; GC–MS; Storage conditions; TBCO","biological marker; carboxyhemoglobin; biological marker; carbon monoxide; carboxyhemoglobin; animal cell; Article; blood analysis; carbon monoxide blood level; carbon monoxide intoxication; concentration (parameter); forensic medicine; freeze thawing; headspace extraction; mass fragmentography; nonhuman; physical chemistry; physical parameters; preservation; priority journal; shelf life; storage temperature; blood; carbon monoxide intoxication; comparative study; forensic medicine; gas chromatography; human; oximetry; procedures; specimen handling; spectrophotometry; statistical analysis; Biomarkers; Carbon Monoxide; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning; Carboxyhemoglobin; Chromatography, Gas; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Forensic Medicine; Humans; Oximetry; Specimen Handling; Spectrophotometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075627675

Even though there is regional fragmentation in terms of climate change strategies in Latin America, market-based initiatives are taking shape also in this region. Post-2020, combining these efforts towards carbon integration via an Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) could be an option for Latin America to adhere to more cohesive and ambitious climate policy actions. Given the lack of quantitative studies, this paper aims to provide preliminary evidence on the appropriateness of this mitigation policy, highlighting potential environmental and economic outcomes in Latin America, as well as identifying trade patterns and the effects of revenue recycling for the region. Using a dynamic-recursive computable equilibrium model, a hypothetical Latin American ETS regulates only carbon emissions from the electricity generation and energy-intensive sectors. Regional carbon-integration among developing countries in this way demonstrates that it is possible to curb emissions at minimum cost. The distributional effect of linking shows a financial flow from Brazil and Mexico to the rest of Latin America, comprising a wider abatement effort within a shared carbon price. There are opportunities from revenue-recycling, which plays an important role in alleviating the additional costs from the policy. The advantage of this approach is to culminate in broad participation where competitiveness concerns may be addressed along with transformations of the energy system. However, to effectively address climate change, additional sectors should be considered for inclusion in the proposed ETS, in line with the region’s energy and economic profiles. Key policy insights A regional carbon policy based on emissions trading in Latin America would expand opportunities for mitigation at lower cost. Brazil and Mexico would import allowances more cost-effectively from the rest of Latin America in the linked scenario. Further energy substitution towards low-carbon sources would be achieved with revenue recycling. A linked ETS system should include land use and forestry-related emissions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Emissions trading scheme (ETS); EPPA6; Latin America ETS; linkage","carbon emission; climate change; developing world; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental policy; numerical model; Brazil; Latin America; Mexico [North America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073935189

It is dependent on local and regional feedstocks, which determine its sustainability. This has led to discussions on how to alter feedstock for biogas plants without compromising their GHG (Greenhouse gas) saving, one particular issue being the use of Maize silage (MS) as the dominant feedstock. To support this discussion, this paper presents an integrated life cycle assessment of energy crop cultivation for 425 biogas catchments in the region of Central Germany (CG). The simulations for the CG region showed that MS as an effective crop to mitigate GHG emissions per kilowatt hour (GHGculti) was context dependent. In some cases, GHGculti reductions were supported due to higher yields, and in other cases, this led to increased GHGculti. We show that the often-proposed strategy of substituting one crop for another needs to be adapted for strategies which take into account the crop mixtures fed into biogas plants and how they perform altogether, under the specific regional and locational conditions. Only in this way can the trade-offs for lower GHGculti be identified and managed. © 2019 by the authors.","Bioeconomy; Bioenergy; Biogas; GHG; Grassland; Maize silage; Regional LCA; Spatial LCA","adaptive management; agricultural emission; anaerobic digestion; bioenergy; biogas; catchment; climate change; cultivation; decentralization; economic activity; emission control; energy crop; grassland; greenhouse gas; integrated approach; life cycle analysis; mitigation; silage; spatial analysis; strategic approach; Germany; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079519808

Determining the emissions mitigation potentials (EMPs) of these measures requires the use of a set of assumptions or longer-term forecasts in an integrated modelling environment. However, the results of longer-term forecasts are only as reliable as the reliability and consistencies of their assumptions and methods with industry trends, as well as their compatibility with other dominating external developments. In this article, nine approaches to modelling aircraft fleet development were reviewed. Each of the first eight approaches used a unique fleet development model, while the last approach combines two additional models with one of the eight models. Therefore, ten global and regional longer-term aircraft fleet development models were reviewed and compared. The review focus was on their individual methods used for aircraft addition to and disposal from the fleet. Where available, the EMPs of individual measures were compared in order to create an overview of the EMPs of the measures. Furthermore, methods used for fleet development modelling in the studies were compared with the airline industry trends and practices for fleet planning in order to identify opportunities for research. This study is useful to policy-makers in knowing the expected emissions mitigation benefit of proposed environmental policies related to the IATA basket of measures. Aviation stakeholders like aircraft manufacturers and airlines would also have an overview of expected emissions savings of individual and combined measures. Lastly, researchers can also understand state-of-the-art modelling methods and scenario assumptions for the purpose of duplication studies, as well as identify unexplored areas for research. © 2019, Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt e.V.","Aircraft fleet; Emissions mitigation; Fleet development; Mitigation measures; Models; Scenarios","Air transportation; Carbon; Environmental protection; Models; Aircraft fleets; Emissions mitigation; Fleet development; Mitigation measures; Scenarios; Aircraft",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074114774

This paper aims at analysing the techno-economic feasibility of hybrid renewable energy system (HRES) for sustainable rural electrification in Benin, using a case study of Fouay village. HOMER software is used to perform optimization, simulation and sensitivity analysis. The analysis showed that hybrid solar photovoltaics (PV)/diesel generator (DG)/battery (of 150 kW/62.5 kVA/637 kWh) is the least cost optimal system. This system ensures a reliable power supply, reduces battery requirements by 70% compared to PV/battery system and achieves 97% CO2 emissions reduction compared to a conventional DG. Moreover, the study demonstrated that the most economical HRES depends strongly on the potential energy sources available at a location and power plant's remoteness from the beneficiary. In summary, as solar radiation is an abundant resource across the country, this hybrid PV/DG/battery system can be a suitable model to power remote areas in Benin, and we recommend it for future electrification projects in the country in place of the current widely deployed PV/battery system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Benin; HOMER; Hybrid energy system; Levelized cost of electricity; Rural electrification; Sustainability","Computer software; Cost benefit analysis; Economic analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Emission control; Potential energy; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Benin; HOMER; Hybrid energy system; Levelized cost of electricities; Rural electrification; Rural areas; alternative energy; cost analysis; electricity supply; energy resource; potential energy; rural electrification; rural population; solar radiation; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068008445

Beef production is an important source of GHG emissions and is expected to increase as the world population grows. LIFE BEEF CARBON is a voluntary European initiative that aims to reduce GHG emissions per unit of beef (carbon footprint) by 15% over a 10-year period on 2172 farms in four large beef-producing countries. Changes in farms beef carbon footprint are normally estimated via simulation modelling, but the methods current models apply differ. Thus, our initial goal was to develop a common modelling framework to estimate beef farms carbon footprint. The framework was developed for a diverse set of Western Europe farms located in Ireland, Spain, Italy and France. Whole farm and life cycle assessment (LCA) models were selected to quantify emissions for the different production contexts and harmonized. Carbon Audit was chosen for Ireland, Bovid-CO2 for Spain and CAP’2ER for France and Italy. All models were tested using 20 case study farms, that is, 5 per country and quantified GHG emissions associated with on-farm live weight gain. The comparison showed the ranking of beef systems gross carbon footprint was consistent across the three models. Suckler to weaning or store systems generally had the highest carbon footprint followed by suckler to beef systems and fattening beef systems. When applied to the same farm, Carbon Audit's footprint estimates were slightly lower than CAP’2ER, but marginally higher than Bovid-CO2. These differences occurred because the models were adapted to a specific region's production circumstances, which meant their emission factors for key sources; that is, methane from enteric fermentation and GHG emissions from concentrates were less accurate when used outside their target region. Thus, for the common modelling framework, region-specific LCA models were chosen to estimate beef carbon footprints instead of a single generic model. Additionally, the Carbon Audit and Bovid-CO2 models were updated to include carbon removal by soil and other environmental metrics included in CAP’2ER, for example, acidification. This allows all models to assess the effect carbon mitigation strategies have on other potential pollutants. Several options were identified to reduce beef farms carbon footprint, for example, improving genetic merit. These options were assessed for beef systems, and a mitigation plan was created by each nation. The cumulative mitigation effect of the LIFE BEEF CARBON plan was estimated to exceed the projects reduction target (−15%). © 2019 The Animal Consortium","cattle; greenhouse gas; life cycle assessment; modelling; sustainability","methane; agricultural land; animal; bovine; carbon footprint; dairying; Europe; female; fermentation; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; maize; male; metabolism; Poaceae; red meat; Animals; Carbon Footprint; Cattle; Dairying; Europe; Farms; Female; Fermentation; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Male; Methane; Poaceae; Red Meat; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082043108

However, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) of heating high-tech greenhouses in northern countries are higher than transporting vegetables produced in southern Europe in unheated tunnels. The aim of this work was to assess GHG emissions when renewable energy sources were used for heating and cooling a solar collector greenhouse (SCG) in comparison with a conventional greenhouse (RG). Thermal energy generated in the SCG from solar energy was stored in an insulated water tank and different strategies were examined: no reused energy; reused energy; reused energy and excess energy transfer. Based on the semi-closed climate control strategy set in SCG and associated higher CO2 concentrations, higher marketable yields were achieved (+22%) compared to the production in the RG. The results further showed that the cumulative energy demand of the SCG can be lowered by approximately 44% compared to that needed in the RG. The carbon footprint (CF) and the water use efficiency were improved by 24% and 28%, respectively. If excess thermal energy generated by the SCG could be considered as export energy, a negative carbon footprint of −0.7 CO2-eq kg−1 can be reached. The latter case shows that the CF can be reduced to levels of unheated greenhouses. As such, vegetable production in solar collector greenhouses can be more sustainable than in conventional greenhouses since energy and water, as well as fertiliser and associate CO2 emissions, can be saved. © 2019 IAgrE","CO2 emissions; Excess energy transfer; Hydroponic tomato; Solar collector greenhouse; Water use efficiency","Carbon dioxide; Collector efficiency; Commerce; Emission control; Energy transfer; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Solar energy; Thermal energy; Thermal processing (foods); Vegetables; Water tanks; CO2 emissions; Cumulative energy demands; Excess energy; Greenhouse production; Hydroponic tomato; Renewable energy source; Vegetable productions; Water use efficiency; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076010166

These ideas are based on the acid-base mechanism of formation of electrochemically active species (EASs). The essence of cationic electrocatalysis is the transformation of anionic complexes into a new active state under the action of cations with a strong polarizing effect. This leads to a change in the energy, electronic, and structural state of the anion, the formation of new EASs, a change in their composition, in the rate of EAS formation and charge transfer. The performed quantum chemical calculations allow one to conclude that the cationic composition of the melt catalyzes the formation of new EASs both in the bulk phase of the melt and at the electrode-melt interface. Using voltammetry, it was shown that the addition of Mg2+ cations to tungstate-containing melts leads to a change of the nature of the electrode process and to an increase of an order of magnitude in heterogeneous rate constant for charge transfer. The tungsten deposition potential shifts to the positive potential values up to the potentials of carbon deposition from CO2. The proposed approach allowed us to realize in practice the synthesis of nanoscale powders of tungsten carbides and composite mixtures based on them by electrolysis of molten salt electrolytes. The obtained materials have a high potential for application for solving various tasks of electrocatalysis. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Ab initio calculations; Cationic electrocatalysis; Electrochemical synthesis; Molten salts; Tungsten carbides",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086970594

The city of Tata is an example of those cities that suffer from catastrophic and devastating occasional floods, torrential erosion and desertification. These risks will be aggravated, by 2030, by urban growth and will be added to the impacts of the increase in temperature linked to global warming3,7-9. In the context of climate change, we propose for the weather station Tata, to study the behavior of interannual rains. The city of Tata is confronted with several irregular rainfall disturbances9. In terms of monthly rainfall, the month of November, which has never exceeded 40 mm since 1985 and sometimes does not record any precipitation, recorded 146 mm in 2014, which caused exceptional and deadly floods. Some months have much higher than normal rainfall such as September 2014 with 88 mm and October 1994 with 105 mm and 520.4 in 2000 and February with 106.5 mm in 2010 and August with 104.6 in 1998. On the annual plan, rainfall variations reach real periods of drought; this is the case for the year 1992 with 11.7 mm, 2001 with 7.5 mm and 2008 with 2.4 mm. This study aims to analyze the rainfall of the Tata station for a 31-year chronic (1985-2016), determine rainfall trends and extract the rainfall variability which are at the origin of all the disasters of storms that occur as well as define the extremes of rainfall heights and in order to provide explanations about the floods and the real drought that the city knows6,11. © 2020, World Research Association.

Drawing on case study evidence, Nochta develops a comparative analysis which discusses the intricate connections between network characteristics, context and impact. It highlights that organisational fragmentation; the complexity of the low-carbon energy problem and historical developments all influence network characteristics in terms of degree of integration and vertical (hierarchical) power relationships among network actors.

Climate variability is a challenge to tourism destinations, especially coastal and Island destinations, categories under which Mombasa, our study site falls under. Mombasa has limited capacity to adapt to climate change considering its socio economic conditions and weak institutions, thus making it necessary to explore the possible sustainable pathways for the city using the enhanced Regional Tourism Sustainable Adaptation Framework. Earlier frameworks for tourism adaptation to climate change lacked focus on regional dynamics as well as sustainability aspects, and their implementation pose the risk of mal adaptation to some extent. Using secondary data and data from interviews with tourism stakeholders in Mombasa, the enhanced Regional Tourism Sustainable Adaptation Framework guides our assessment of vulnerability and resilience of the destination, as well as identification of region specific adaptation options for the city within the context of sustainable practice. Based on climate change perceived impacts, risks and vulnerability various adaptation options are presented and discussed as provided in literature.

Global warming of the planet is a result of the emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere and the cause of serious sustainability issues. The objective of this article is to highlight the potential of the Six Sigma methodology to reduce energy consumption in the productive sphere, with consequential reductions in pollutant emissions. We present a systematic literature review that highlights the increasing interest from academics and practitioners in using quality management philosophies for addressing sustainability issues. From the analysis carried out, it is clear that Lean is being used in this regard but the potential of Six Sigma is not being exploited. Taking advantage of the best of both approaches (Lean Six Sigma) can contribute to reducing energy consumption in industrial processes and contribute to mitigating the impacts of those processes on climate change. Moreover, through keyword analysis, we found that the three dimensions of sustainability are currently gaining importance in the literature, when previously only the economic pillar was relevant. Finally, we raise some questions for reflection for academics but also for practitioners, as the problem is a global problem that should be faced by all the community. © 2020 by the authors.","Climate change; Energy saving; Lean; Literature review; Operational excellence; Process improvement; Six Sigma; Sustainability","climate change; energy conservation; industrial ecology; literature review; operations technology; philosophy; questionnaire survey; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079657679

The kind of particulate matter is significantly related to its source. Hence, evaluation and measurement of airborne particulates and its sources assist in generating an abstract model for source apportionment (SA). SA means a method to recognize responsible sources of ambient particulate matter and its influence on the basis of species data for receptor locations. On the basis of mass balance theory and specific hypothesis, various numerical models are established to effectively enumerate sources of particulates. Nevertheless, in Indian perspective, receptor models have been used for majority of SA studies and, therefore, these models are the emphasis of this paper.

In recent years, “customizing the development of bioenergy to local conditions” and “prioritizing distributed utilization” have been the two key principles that have been released by the Chinese government to promote the national- and provincial-level development of bioenergy. While many recognize the importance of bioenergy in achieving low-carbon transition, little is known about the high-resolution distribution of usable biomass feedstock and technical bioenergy potential in China, which brings about uncertainties and additional challenges for creating localized utilization plans. We propose a new assessment framework that integrates crop growth models, a land suitability assessment, and the geographic information systems to address these knowledge gaps. Distributions of 11 types of usable biomass feedstock and three kinds of technical bioenergy potential are mapped out through specific transformation technologies at 1 km resolution. At the national level, the final technical biogas potential is 1.91 EJ. The technical bioethanol potential (0.04–0.96 EJ) from the energy crop can supply 0.13–3.12 times the bioethanol demand for the consumption of E10 gasoline in 2015. The technical heat potential (1.06 EJ) can meet 20% of the demand for heating in all provinces (5.38 EJ). Most of the 2020 bioenergy goals can be achieved, excluding that for bioethanol, which will need to require more cellulosic ethanol from residues. At the provincial level, Henan and Inner Mongolia have the potential to develop clean heating alternatives via the substitution of agroforestry residues for coal. The results can provide a systematic analysis of the distribution of biomass feedstocks and technical bioenergy potential in China. With economic factors taken into consideration in further research, it can also support national and provincial governments in making bioenergy development plans in an effective and timely manner. © 2019 The Authors.

However, their effects have never been studied in an RSI/alternate-year system in the cold region of Northeast China. The present study involved a 2-year field experiment analyzing the effects of irrigation method and RSI on CH4 emissions. Our results showed that controlled irrigation (CI) significantly decreased cumulative CH4 emissions by 55% when compared to flood irrigation (FI). RSI increased CH4 emissions in both CI and FI. CI accelerated the decreasing rate of straw residual while decreasing the total cumulative CH4 over the 2 years. The cumulative CH4 emissions of treatments with RSI were higher in the first year than in the second year. Our results suggest that CI with 6 t hm−2 of RSI is an ideal strategy to mitigate CH4 emissions in an RSI/alternate-year system in Northeast China. © 2019, The International Society of Paddy and Water Environment Engineering.","Irrigation methods; Methane; Paddy field; Rice straw incorporation","Methane; Controlled irrigations; Field experiment; Flood irrigation; Irrigation methods; Major factors; Northeast China; Paddy fields; Rice straws; Irrigation; cold region; crop production; flood frequency; irrigation system; methane; paddy field; rice; straw; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070937676

The required reductions in greenhouse gas emissions imply a massive decarbonization worldwide with much involvement of regions, cities, businesses, and individuals in addition to the commitments at the national levels. Improving end-use efficiency is emphasized in previous IPCC reports (IPCC 2014). Serving as the primary ‘agents of change’ in the transformative process towards green economies, households have a key role in global emission reduction. Individual actions, especially when amplified through social dynamics, shape green energy demand and affect investments in new energy technologies that collectively can curb regional and national emissions. However, most energy-economics models—usually based on equilibrium and optimization assumptions—have a very limited representation of household heterogeneity and treat households as purely rational economic actors. This paper illustrates how computational social science models can complement traditional models by addressing this limitation. We demonstrate the usefulness of behaviorally rich agent-based computational models by simulating various behavioral and climate scenarios for residential electricity demand and compare them with the business as usual (SSP2) scenario. Our results show that residential energy demand is strongly linked to personal and social norms. Empirical evidence from surveys reveals that social norms have an essential role in shaping personal norms. When assessing the cumulative impacts of these behavioral processes, we quantify individual and combined effects of social dynamics and of carbon pricing on individual energy efficiency and on the aggregated regional energy demand and emissions. The intensity of social interactions and learning plays an equally important role for the uptake of green technologies as economic considerations, and therefore in addition to carbon-price policies (top-down approach), implementing policies on education, social and cultural practices can significantly reduce residential carbon emissions. © 2019, The Author(s).","Agent-based modeling; Behavioral change; Carbon emissions; Climate change mitigation; Energy economics; Macroeconomic impacts; Residential energy","Autonomous agents; Carbon; Climate models; Computational methods; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Investments; Agent-based model; Behavioral changes; Carbon emissions; Climate change mitigation; Energy economics; Macroeconomic impact; Residential energy; Climate change; assessment method; carbon emission; energy efficiency; environmental economics; green economy; macroeconomics; modeling; residential energy; urban area; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074829730

In this international landscape, countries will look to learn from one another, but identifying peer countries for this learning can prove a challenge. In this study, we measure public support for transportation policies and use this as a measure of cultural distance to identify peer countries. We modeled public support for 11 transportation policies in an international sample of 41,932 individuals in 51 countries or regions. Using a model that controls for individual effects, we measure pure country-level differences in public policy support. Measuring public support for different transportation policies can help policymakers understand how the public evaluates and envisions the role of government in shaping the current as well as future transportation system, and to anticipate difficulties of implementing certain types of policy because of public resistance. In general, we find the highest public support for a given policy appears in countries that have not yet seen significant investment in the target infrastructure or service. We show that considering public support for transportation policies gives a different perspective than traditional indicators of economic development or level of motorization, helping policymakers understand what the public wants and how they might build support for new transportation policies. Finally, we present a clustering framework that goes beyond development status and geographical adjacency to help identify peer countries for policy learning using public policy support as a measure of cultural distance. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",,"Climate change; Economics; Investments; Public policy; Development status; Level difference; National governments; Policy learning; Sustainable transportation; Transportation policies; Transportation sector; Transportation system; Planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103796639

However, study on water–air interface CO2 exchange from small rivers remains limited, which causes large uncertainty of local and global carbon budgets. Based on seasonal field measurements, carbonate equilibria (CO2SYS program) and empirical models of gas transfer velocity (k value), we investigated the CO2 partial pressure (pCO2), CO2 emission and its controlling factors in the Longchuan River, a subtropical river in the Dry-hot Valley Region of Southwest China. Over 88% of samples were found to be oversaturated with atmospheric CO2, and the mean pCO2 ranged from 1497 ± 1415 μatm (dry period) to 1734 ± 1648 μatm (post-wet period). With the calibrated k values of 43.4–80.5 cm/h, the CO2 emission rates were estimate at 443–514 mmol/m2/day. We highlighted that long-term gully erosion enhanced the buffering capacity of carbonates in the aquatic environment and resulted in seasonal differences in riverine pCO2. Intensive agricultural practices could alter the pCO2 and further stimulate CO2 emissions. There were positive correlations of pCO2-elevation and pCO2-DOC in the initial-wet period but not in the dry period. This study suggests that extreme soil erosion and anthropogenic activities can regulate environmental variables and thus greatly affect the riverine CO2 outgassing. Our findings provide key insights into the understandings of dynamic controls on riverine pCO2 and CO2 outgassing under global change. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","CO2 outgassing; CO2 partial pressure (pCO2); Controlling factors; Dry-hot Valley Region; Environmental couplings; Upper Yangtze River","anthropogenic effect; aquatic environment; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbonate; degassing; global change; gully erosion; partial pressure; soil erosion; supersaturation; China; Longchuan River; Yangtze River; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076857294

Loss separation reveals that both hysteresis loss and eddy current loss reduce significantly after Co2Y addition. The mechanism of magnetic loss decreasing due to Co2Y additive is discussed, and the decrease of magnetic hysteresis loss and eddy current loss caused by Co2+ cation doping was regarded as the main reason for the observed power loss decrease in ferrites and insulating grain boundary composed by barium compound which plays a role in decreasing eddy current loss.

These issues pose a significant threat to social, economic and environmental welfare. Attempts to prevent forest loss and increased attention to pilot REDD+ projects in community forestry sites would both deliver rural livelihood benefits and help to reduce adverse climate impacts. However, there has been no significant exploration of the viewpoints of local experts to determine the monitoring and action needed to support community-based forestry and improve the governance of REDD+ pilot projects in Cambodia. Therefore, this study aimed to assess the perceptions of local stakeholders towards the quality of governance of the first community forest REDD+ pilot project in Cambodia, employing Q-methodology. We adapted 11 indicators of the hierarchical framework of assessment of governance quality to design 40 Q-statements related to REDD+ governance or achievements. The 52 P-set ranked these Q-statements with respect to the community-based REDD+ pilot project. Our study revealed that local stakeholders held four distinct, and partially opposite, views, that: (1) the REDD+ project is successful because it is inclusiveness and capable of causing behavioral change; (2) REDD+ pilot projects should be led by government, not external or locally; and needs more resources; (3) the REDD+ pilot project has raised unrealistic expectations, would likely be a source of corruption and will probably not be successful for local people or halting deforestation; and (4) the REDD+ pilot project is inclusive but not very transparent and probably ineffective at protecting forest. Through these four varied perspectives from local people involved in the project, we can see that there remain serious challenges to the future of pilot community forestry REDD+ projects, including the complex interaction between the multinational actors and the local socio-ecological systems. To move forwards, this study suggested Cambodia should make a pro-poor REDD+ program, implementing more community-based REDD+ projects which explicitly build the assets and capacity of the poorest households.

The EI is an important activity in AQM. Based on EI results, key pollutants of concern and their key sources could be identified; thereby, the source emission control efforts can be prioritized to reduce air pollution in the domain. Data computing and management through cloud system could potentially help to facilitate the storage and flows of an intensive amount of EI information.

A nanosecond pulse power supply (NSP) was evaluated and compared with direct current (DC). During the EC process, municipal wastewater was collected from the sewage center in Nagaoka City, Japan. Four Fe electrodes were connected in a monopolar parallel configuration (MP-P). The obtained results indicated that the maximum COD removal efficiencies were 72 % and 82 % using DC and NSP, respectively. The use of an NSP allows EC operation at high voltage without the breakdown of the medium between the electrodes, promoting iron hydroxide flocs and the quantity of hydrogen bubbles as well as enhancing the COD removal efficiency with low specific energy consumption (SEC). At a similar COD removal efficiency (~ 72 %), compared with DC, an NSP could reduce the SEC by approximately 40 %. Therefore, compared with DC, the use of an NSP allows low-cost operation and enhances the COD removal efficiency from municipal wastewater. Analysis of the electrochemically generated byproducts by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM), X-ray diffraction (XRD), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) showed that NSP flocs had higher adsorption properties for pollutants than DC flocs. The results permitted us to conclude that an NSP could be useful for promoting the spread of EC and the use of renewable energy sources for wastewater treatment to reduce the carbon footprint of the entire process. © 2020 The Authors.","COD; Electrocoagulation; Iron electrode; Nanosecond pulse; Specific energy consumption",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082113944

However, GDI engines emit higher levels of black carbon (BC) aerosols compared to traditional port fuel injection (PFI) engines. Here, we performed coupled chemical transport and radiative transfer simulations to estimate the aerosol-induced public health and direct radiative effects of shifting the U.S. fleet from PFI to GDI technology. By comparing simulations with current emission profiles and emission profiles modified to reflect a shift from PFI to GDI, we calculated the change in aerosol (mostly BC) concentrations associated with the fleet change. Standard concentration-response calculations indicated that the total annual deaths in the U.S. attributed to particulate gasoline-vehicle emissions would increase from 855 to 1599 due to shifting from PFI to GDI. Furthermore, the increase in BC associated with the shift would lead to an annual average positive radiative effect over the U.S. of approximately +0.075 W/m2, with values as large as +0.45 W/m2 over urban regions. On the other hand, the reduction in CO2 emissions associated with the enhanced fuel economy of GDI vehicles would yield a globally uniform negative radiative effect, estimated to be -0.013 W/m2 over a 20 year time horizon. Therefore, the climate burden of the increase in BC emissions dominates over the U.S., especially over source regions. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Aerosols; Competition; Engines; Fuel economy; Gasoline; Public health; Black carbon aerosol; Chemical transport; Gasoline direct injection; Health implications; Light duty vehicles; Port fuel injection engines; Radiative transfer simulations; Response calculation; Direct injection; black carbon; gasoline; ozone; aerosol; black carbon; comparative study; electric vehicle; emission; health impact; irradiation; public health; radiative transfer; technological change; aerosol; air quality; Article; chemical reaction; comparative study; controlled study; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; particulate matter; public health; secondary organic aerosol; surface property; United States; urban area; aerosol; air pollutant; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; public health; soot; United States; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Gasoline; Motor Vehicles; Particulate Matter; Public Health; Soot; United States; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078397301

Many CAILU are also characterized by insufficient infrastructure, poor environmental quality, and socially vulnerable populations. Manchester, TX is a marginalized CAILU neighborhood proximate to several petrochemical industrial sites that is prone to frequent flooding. Pollutants from stormwater runoff discharge from industrial land uses into residential areas have created increased toxicant exposures. Working with local organizations, centers/institutes, stakeholders, and residents, public health researchers sampled air, water, indoor dust, and outdoor soil while researchers from landscape architecture and urban planning applied these findings to develop a community-scaled master plan. The plan utilizes land use and built environment changes to increase flood resiliency and decrease exposure to contaminants. Using a combination of models to assess the performance, costs, and benefits of green infrastructure and pollutant load impacts, the master plan is projected to capture 147,456 cubic feet of runoff, and create $331,400 of annual green benefits by reducing air pollution and energy use, providing pollution treatment, increase carbon dioxide sequestration, and improve groundwater replenishment. Simultaneously, there is a 41% decrease across all analyzed pollutants, reducing exposure to and transferal of toxic materials. © 2020 by the authors.

Evolutionary history of crop species, effects of crop domestication and adaptation to different environments on crop population and identification of genes/genomic regions that control important agronomic and adaptive traits were studied. Yield and quality have been primary aims for our breeders, who also strived to anticipate the future needs of the society, developing resilient varieties to environment, pests and diseases by using traditional and biotechnological tools. Innovation in vineyard and orchard management was introduced by developing new strategies or adapting traditional techniques to the needs of social and climate changes. Cultivated landscape preservation was pursued by improving carbon sequestration, increasing soil fertility and reducing the risks of soil erosion and nitrogen leaching. Studies on social support and consumer appreciation of sustainable farming systems marked the importance of matching food safety and security, conservation of biodiversity and improvement of ecosystem services.

Bitumen mining in the Alberta oil sands region of western Canada requires reclamation to “equivalent land capability,” implying establishment of vegetation similar to undisturbed boreal ecosystems. However, there is consensus that this region will be exposed to relatively severe climate warming, causing increased occurrence of drought and wildfire, which threaten the persistence of both natural and reclaimed ecosystems. We used a landscape model, LANDIS-II, to simulate plant responses to climate change and disturbances, forecasting changes to boreal forests within the oil sands region. Under the most severe climate forcing scenarios (representative concentration pathway [RCP] 8.5) the model projected substantial decreases in forest biomass, with the future forest being dominated by drought- and fire-tolerant species characteristic of parkland or prairie ecosystems. In contrast, less extreme climate forcing scenarios (RCPs 2.6 and 4.5) had relatively minor effects on forest composition and biomass with boreal conifers continuing to dominate the landscape. If the climate continues to change along a trajectory similar to those simulated by climate models for the RCP 8.5 forcing scenario, current reclamation goals to reestablish spruce-dominated boreal forest will likely be difficult to achieve. Results from scenario modeling studies such as ours, and continued monitoring of change in the boreal forest, will help inform reclamation practices, which could include establishment of species better adapted to warmer and drier conditions. © 2019 Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada.

Recent studies in Southern Africa (of which Zimbabwe is part) have indicated the extreme vulnerabilities of smallholder farmers to the impact of climate change and recommended that appropriate adaptation measures be put in place. In-field rainwater harvesting is one of the adaptation strategies that has been adopted by some smallholder farmers in drought-prone regions. The study examines the effectiveness of in-field rainwater harvesting as a climate change adaptation strategy for smallholder farmers in Gwanda district, Zimbabwe. Data was collected through semi-structured questionnaires (administered to 45 smallholder farmers) and five key informants. We find that most respondents adopted pit planting and mulching in-field rainwater harvesting techniques. A few respondents practised deep tillage, dead level contours, ephemeral stream diversion, ridges/furrows and hillside sheet runoff. In-field rainwater harvesting techniques increase the time required for crop moisture to set in resulting in improved crop yields. However, farmers are reluctant to adopt in-field rainwater harvesting techniques as they are labour intensive and some require technical expertise.

These factors have enduring hydro-ecological effects on the environments and combine to limit our understanding of large scale hydrological processes and impacts of climate on water availability. Considering the fact that several hydrogeological perturbations and disturbances have been reported during the last decade in South America (SA), a further assessment of continental land water storage is therefore warranted. In this study, a two-step regularization approach that combined the JADE (Joint Approximate Diagonalisation of Eigen matrices) algorithm and PLSR (partial least squares regression) was employed to assess GRACE (Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment)-terrestrial water storage (TWS) over SA. Based on the Bartlett's statistics, significant independent patterns of SST (Sea Surface Temperature) anomalies from the Pacific and Atlantic oceans were used in the PLSR scheme to model the temporal evolutions of TWS (2002-2017) over twelve prominent river basins in SA. From the JADE rotation of TWS over SA, strong inter-annual changes in TWS observed over the Amazon basin and within its floodplain corridors were identified. The unabated mass loss in Patagonia ice-field caused by warming of the climate and other GRACE-hydrological signals were also retrieved from the JADE scheme. The rainfall-TWS relationship is considerably strong (r = 0.80 at 0-2 months lag) in much of tropical SA, including the Amazon basin and highlights the influence of climate variability in the region. Medium (r=0.40) and moderately strong (r=0.60) rainfall-TWS relationship were also found to be significant (α=0.05) but with up to 4 months lag and more in some basins. During the 2010-2017 period, estimated TWS trends (α=0.05) showed a considerable fall in Orinoco (-38.48±7.90 mm/yr) and Sao Francisco (-30.84±4.17) while the strongest rise was found in Uruguay (28.28±3.49 mm/yr). As the rainfall-TWS relationship is not statistically significant (α=0.05) in some areas, the spatial distribution of trends in TWS and rainfall, especially in some arid regions, which are inconsistent confirm possible impacts resulting from complex hydrogeological processes and/or anthropogenic influence. Further, in the modelling of TWS time series using the JADE-PLSR scheme, several validation skill metrics (e.g., R2, Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency) confirm the considerable agreements between predicted and observed TWS in the Amazon (R2=0.95), Orinoco (R2=0.94), Tocantins (R2=0.91), and Chobut (R2=0.88). However, GRACE-hydrological signals in some regions are somewhat complex given the relatively higher uncertainties in the multivariate models employed in this study. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Amazon basin; Climate variability; ENSO; Partial least square regression; Rainfall; Sea surface temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Climatology; Least squares approximations; Rain; Silicate minerals; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Amazon basin; Climate variability; ENSO; Partial least square regression; Sea surface temperature (SST); Oceanography; annual variation; climate change; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; floodplain; GRACE; hydrogeology; rainfall; regression analysis; river basin; sea surface temperature; water storage; Amazon Basin; Atlantic Ocean; Brazil; Orinoco River; Pacific Ocean; Patagonia; Tocantins River; Uruguay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074989888

Climate change and variability add a compounding effect to this complex, multi stressor context. Addressing the complexity requires an understanding of urban ecosystems functioning and interactions amongst the built and natural environment (climate) and human systems. In this paper we argue that learning is essential for cities to be resilient to current and future challenges. We profile the Future Resilience for African CiTies And Lands (FRACTAL) project which contributed towards climate resilient development by providing relevant climate information for decision-making at the city regional scale in southern Africa. Following FRACTAL's city-to-city learning approach of sharing good practices, knowledge and experiences framed around transdisciplinary research, the study cities of Harare, Lusaka, Windhoek and Durban conducted city learning exchange visits between 2017 and 2018. We used a mixed methods approach to collect and analyze historical climate and hydrological data and current socio-economic and development data among the cities. A qualitative, in-depth, case study comparative analysis was used to identify similarities and differences as well as lessons drawn from the learning process during the city exchanges and these were complimented by desktop studies. Results showed water scarcity, large informal settlements, reliance on external water and energy sources, inadequate protection of ecologically sensitive resources and service provision as some of the common complications in the cities. Several lessons and transferable practices learnt from the cities included effective water conservation and waste management and the use of public-private partnerships in Windhoek, community engagements in Durban and Lusaka while lessons on decisive leadership in dealing with informal settlements emanated from Harare's limited informal settlements. Lastly, Durban's Adaptation Charter and integrated climate planning provided lessons for biodiversity protection and mainstreaming climate change at city governance level. While we recognize that cities are context-specific we consider these good practices as being broadly transferable to other southern African cities. We conclude that social, experiential and structured learning can be an innovative way of multi-stakeholder engagement and a useful approach to increase city resilience planning across southern Africa and cities that face similar developmental challenges. © 2020 Ndebele-Murisa et al.",,"Article; biodiversity; city planning; climate change; climate resilience; environmental decision making; environmental management; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; environmental protection; human; hydrology; social behavior; South Africa; urbanization; waste management; water conservation; city; climate change; ecosystem; epidemiology; fractal analysis; government; knowledge; learning; South Africa; water supply; water; Biodiversity; Cities; City Planning; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Fractals; Government; Humans; Knowledge; Learning; South Africa; Urbanization; Waste Management; Water; Water Resources",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078279655

In the past few decades, efforts focused on reducing sulfur dioxide emission for environment protection had limited the use of S-based fertilizers in agriculture, thereby causing S deficiency in food crops. It also triggered the susceptibility of crop plants to environmental stresses as S assimilation and synthesis of different S compounds modulate several metabolic processes to induce tolerance against various abiotic stresses. The use of inorganic fertilizers containing S has increased tremendously in recent years due to its significance in enhancing crop yield and quality. Therefore, in this chapter, we discuss recent studies on effects of S fertilizers on growth and yield of major cereals (wheat, maize, rice), legumes (mung bean, chickpea, black gram), and oilseeds (sunflower, brassica, soybean). An overview of current state of knowledge on S-mediated physiological and biochemical alterations in food crops may facilitate in developing appropriate fertilizer management strategies to improve yield and quality under abiotic stress conditions. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Environmental stresses; Fertilizer management; Food crops; Sulfur",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089644574

These targets are often dependent upon the building program (e.g. office), but independent from its context; the same value is imposed for two buildings of the same program regardless of other possibly influential characteristics (e.g. solar exposure). Such targets serve as references against which a project's performance is measured following its description and assessment using an evaluation tool. In this paper, we question the suitability of this procedure within the context of urban planning by asking: should a district-level performance objective be allocated in a ‘uniform’ manner or through a ‘contextual’ approach, capable of capturing specificities throughout the site and allowing compensation between areas? To address this question, a novel method is proposed to distribute a site-level target differently between lots presenting distinct conditions over the site, through a combined top-down and bottom-up approach. The method relies on the exploration of databases of lot-specific scenarios, generated by varying design parameters that have not yet been fixed at the planning stage, such as building shape and construction materials. Applied on a case-study district in Switzerland, the contextual method results in differentiated lot-specific targets that are up to 11% away from the uniform targets. Although apparently small, these shifts can increase the feasibility of reaching the site-level target by up to 30%. Such information can guide the design team towards defining a coherent environmental strategy and making informed decisions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Design decisions; Environmental impact targets; Life cycle assessment; New districts; Urban planning","Building materials; Decision making; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Life cycle; Urban planning; Zoning; Bottom up approach; Design decisions; Environmental performance; Environmental strategy; Informed decision; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); New districts; Performance objective; Urban growth; architectural design; building construction; decision making; feasibility study; life cycle analysis; performance assessment; urban planning; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073947330

This paper focuses mainly on computing the optimum installed capacity of thermal/coal based power plants considering the average hourly demand over the months of the year. To compute the optimum installed capacity of thermal/coal base power plants, based on the past trends three cases have been considered - lowest out of minimum of average hourly demand, lowest out of average of the average hourly demand and highest out of minimum of average hourly demand. The proposed methodology has been implemented on the average demand chart of state of Maharashtra, India for the year 2018.

However, the current process of extracting useable energy from urban biomass has two problems that must be addressed in order to achieve greater energy efficiency: (1) significant fossil fuel consumption is currently needed to dry sewage sludge in wastewater treatment plants, and (2) a huge amount of exhaust heat from incineration plants remains unused. One promising solution is to integrate wastewater treatment and incineration plants. In this way, total energy efficiency could be enhanced by utilizing the exhaust heat generated in the incineration plant to dry sewage sludge in the companion wastewater treatment plant. Aiming to clarify sustainable conditions for integrating the two plants, this paper proposes a method for conducting a life cycle analysis for urban biomass utilization. The proposed method combines scenario storylines and quantitative assessment to provide a better understanding of critical factors and their rationales. Each scenario is quantified by process network modeling and then evaluated in terms of their economic profit and carbon dioxide emissions. A case study involving a Japanese waste water treatment plant and a nearby incineration plant is conducted. The results show that the integration scenario reduces total annual costs by 35% and total annual carbon dioxide emissions by 1% relative to the status quo scenario. This is mainly due to the elimination of several system components, including a digestion tank, made possible by the integration. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Economic and environmental assessment; Exhaust heat; Incineration plant; Process integration; Urban biomass; Wastewater treatment plant","Artificial life; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage sludge; Sewage treatment plants; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Economic and environmental assessments; Exhaust heat; Incineration plant; Process integration; Urban biomass; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072829346

However, with recent developments in new technologies (such as decentralized energy systems, urban energy systems, energy storage systems, etc.) many different options and combination of measures exist to decarbonize the building stock, which requires an update of current versions of technical energy regulations. The aim of this work is to investigate the optimal transformation strategies for buildings and districts to reach CO2 emission reduction targets for the Swiss building stock, to support policies and decision makers in developing new energy regulations for the future. A simulation approach is developed, which combines clustering methods, to define representative buildings and districts, with multi-objective optimization to investigate the optimal set of building and district measures to minimize costs and CO2 emissions. Results at building level show that the most economical measures for reaching emission targets for the future include roof retrofitting and window replacement together with PV installation. In terms of heating systems, biomass or heat pumps seem to be the most favourable option. The analysis of district archetypes shows that district level solutions are mainly applicable to urban communities, whereas building level solutions are clearly the optimal solution for rural areas. © 2019",,"Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Emission control; Energy policy; Multiobjective optimization; Clustering methods; CO2 emission reduction; Decentralized energy system; Energy regulation; Energy storage systems; Optimal transformation; Simulation approach; Urban energy systems; Buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076847434

Although several carbon accounting methods have been proposed to identify mitigation responsibility of cities, there is still no single common and widely accepted method. In this study, we have adopted a method that is based on four system boundaries to identify and compare per capita CO2 emissions of six large Japanese cities in 1980 and 2000. Despite the fact that substantial differences exist among these cities in terms of industrial structure and transformation, population, and local climatic conditions, we found that the per capita CO2 emissions for the system boundary 4, which is CO2 emissions attribution to city from the consumption perspectives, are very similar among them and are stable over the 20-year study period, although those for all the other system boundaries are not similar. This is in contrast to the general claims made by local authorities regarding their success in reducing per capita CO2 emissions. Such claims are made on the basis of emissions estimated using the system boundary 2 method. We argue that using the system boundary 4 provides a more realistic account of changes in urban CO2 emissions and trends and should be adopted by local authorities in their pursuit of urban climate change mitigation goals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon accounting; Climate change mitigation; Consumption-based emissions; Input-output analysis; Japanese cities; Mitigation responsibilities","Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Carbon accounting; Climate change mitigation; Input output analysis; Japanese cities; Mitigation responsibilities; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073571779

This is particularly relevant in large cities where urban heat island makes cities warmer than the surrounding areas. We investigate how urban vegetation, housing characteristics and socio-economic factors modify the association between heat exposure and mortality in a large urban area. Methods: We linked 185,397 death records from the Greater London area during May-Sept 2007–2016 to a high resolution daily temperature dataset. We then applied conditional logistic regression within a case-crossover design to estimate the odds of death from heat exposure by individual (age, sex) and local area factors: land-use type, natural environment (vegetation index, tree cover, domestic garden), built environment (indoor temperature, housing type, lone occupancy) and socio-economic factors (deprivation, English language, level of employment and prevalence of ill-health). Results: Temperatures were higher in neighbourhoods with lower levels of urban vegetation and with higher levels of income deprivation, social-rented housing, and non-native English speakers. Heat-related mortality increased with temperature increase (Odds Ratio (OR), 95% CI = 1.039, 1.036–1.043 per 1 °C temperature increase). Vegetation cover showed the greatest modification effect, for example the odds of heat-related mortality in quartiles with the highest and lowest tree cover were OR, 95%CI 1.033, 1.026–1.039 and 1.043, 1.037–1.050 respectively. None of the socio-economic variables were a significant modifier of heat-related mortality. Conclusions: We demonstrate that urban vegetation can modify the mortality risk associated with heat exposure. These findings make an important contribution towards informing city-level climate change adaptation and mitigation policies. © 2019",,"Atmospheric temperature; Economics; Forestry; Housing; Land use; Logistic regression; Vegetation; Case-crossover designs; Climate change adaptation; Conditional logistic regressions; Heat related mortality; Housing characteristic; Natural environments; Socio-economic factor; Temperature increase; Climate change; environmental risk; health risk; heat island; heat shock; mortality; neighborhood; population decline; urban climate; urban population; aged; Article; built environment; cause of death; climate change; controlled study; domestic garden; employment; England; English (language); female; housing type; human; indoor temperature; land use; level of employment; lone occupancy; male; mortality; neighborhood; prevalence of ill health; priority journal; risk factor; social isolation; social status; thermal exposure; tree; tree cover; urban area; vegetation; vegetation index; very elderly; city; crossover procedure; heat; mortality; England; London [England]; United Kingdom; Cities; Climate Change; Cross-Over Studies; Hot Temperature; London; Mortality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074754433

The identification of mountain permafrost, particularly in the discontinuous permafrost regions, is challenging due to limited data availability and the high spatial variability of controlling factors. This study focuses on mountain permafrost in a data-scarce environment of northern Mongolia, at the interface between the boreal forest and the dry steppe mid-latitudes. In this region, the ground temperature has been increasing continuously since 2011 and has a high spatial variability due to the distribution of incoming solar radiation, as well as seasonal snow and vegetation cover. We analyzed the effect of these controlling factors to understand the climate–permafrost relationship based on in situ observations. Furthermore, mean ground surface temperature (MGST) was calculated at 30-m resolution to predict permafrost distribution. The calculated MGST, with a root mean square error of ±1.4°C, shows permafrost occurrence on north-facing slopes and at higher elevations and absence on south-facing slopes. Borehole temperature data indicate a serious wildfire-induced permafrost degradation in the region; therefore, special attention should be paid to further investigations on ecosystem resilience and climate change mitigation in this region. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

One predominantly challenging aspect in this regard is the design and manufacture of divertor target plasma-facing components (PFCs) that have to sustain substantial particle, heat and neutron fluxes during fusion operation. With respect to the design of highly loaded actively cooled PFCs, copper (Cu) alloys are currently regarded as state-of-the-art structural heat sink materials (HSM). However, it has been underlined that the use of Cu alloys in PFCs implies issues mainly due to the behaviour of these materials under neutron irradiation characterised by a pronounced loss of ductility at lower and a loss of strength at elevated temperatures. These operating temperature limitations impose a strong constraint on the design of divertor PFCs and have regarding DEMO in the literature been termed a high impact design engineering risk. Against this background, the development of tungsten-copper (W-Cu) composites as potentially advanced HSMs for highly loaded PFCs was pursued by the authors during recent years. The progress of these developments is discussed in the present paper in terms of results of high-heat-flux tests conducted on PFC mock-ups that comprised W-Cu composite material heat sinks. Overall, the results of these tests indicate that W-Cu composites can indeed be regarded a viable class of advanced materials for the heat sink of highly loaded PFCs. © EUROfusion Max-Planck-Institut für Plasmaphysik.","Copper; Heat sink material; Metal matrix composite; Plasma-facing component; Tungsten","Binary alloys; Copper alloys; Heat flux; Heat sinks; High temperature engineering; Mockups; Neutron irradiation; Temperature; Thermonuclear reactions; Tungsten; Design and manufactures; Elevated temperature; Heat sink materials; Magnetic confinement; Operating temperature; Plasma-facing components; Thermonuclear fusion devices; Tungsten-copper composites; Cesium alloys",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084661237

We assessed these pathways using indoor exposure monitoring data from the HEALS study in four European urban areas (Edinburgh, UK; Utrecht, Netherlands; Athens and Thessaloniki, Greece). Methods: We quantified three metrics of residential greenspace at 50 m and 100 m buffers: Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), annual tree cover density, and surrounding green land use. NDVI values were generated for both summer and the season during which the monitoring took place. Indoor PM2.5 and noise levels were measured by Dylos and Netatmo sensors, respectively, and subjective noise annoyance was collected by questionnaire on an 11-point scale. We used random-effects generalised least squares regression models to assess associations between greenspace and indoor PM2.5 and noise, and an ordinal logistic regression to model the relationship between greenspace and road noise annoyance. Results: We identified a significant inverse relationship between summer NDVI and indoor PM2.5 (−1.27 μg/m3 per 0.1 unit increase [95% CI -2.38 to −0.15]) using a 100 m residential buffer. Reduced (i.e., &lt;1.0) odds ratios (OR) of road noise annoyance were associated with increasing summer (OR = 0.55 [0.31 to 0.98]) and season-specific (OR = 0.55 [0.32 to 0.94]) NDVI levels, and tree cover density (OR = 0.54 [0.31 to 0.93] per 10 percentage point increase), also at a 100 m buffer. In contrast to these findings, we did not identify any significant associations between greenspace and indoor noise in fully adjusted models. Conclusions: We identified reduced indoor levels of PM2.5 and noise annoyance, but not overall noise, with increasing outdoor levels of certain greenspace indicators. To corroborate our findings, future research should examine the effect of enhanced temporal resolution of greenspace metrics during different seasons, characterise the configuration and composition of green areas, and explore mechanisms through mediation modelling. © 2019","Air pollution; Exposome; Greenspace; Noise annoyance; Particulate matter","atmospheric pollution; greenspace; indoor air; NDVI; noise pollution; particulate matter; public health; adult; air pollution; ambient air; annoyance; Article; autumn; effect size; environmental exposure; environmental health; environmental monitoring; female; Greece; home environment; household; human; indoor air pollution; land use; latitude; longitude; major clinical study; male; Netherlands; noise; particulate matter; population density; priority journal; railway; season; smoking; spring; statistical significance; summer; tree; United Kingdom; urban area; winter; air pollutant; indoor air pollution; odds ratio; Europe; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Environmental Exposure; Greece; Netherlands; Noise; Odds Ratio; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073825430

This study assessed changes in the ecosystem services values (ESVs) due to LUCC during the period 1990-2016 in the Kilombero Valley floodplain, located in southeastern Tanzania. Moderate resolution Landsat images from 1990, 2010 and 2016 were obtained and analyzed using a random forest (RF) algorithm for classification, and ArcGIS Desktop software (version 10.2, Esri, Redlands, CA, USA) for mapping to assess the LUCC. The ESVs were estimated based on the benefit transfer approach using adopted global value coeffcients and modified local value coeffcients. The results revealed that the aggregated ESVs of the forests, bushlands, wetlands, and water had decreased, consequently leading to a total loss of US$ 811.5 million (26.6%) in ESVs over the past 26 years when calculated with the modified local value coeffcients to US$ 3000.7 million (42.3%) when calculated with global value coeffcients. Moreover, the loss in the ESV was attributed to the decreased values of water regulation, climate regulation, erosion control, nutrient cyclying, habitat/refugia, and water supply, with the exception of the values of food production and biological control, which gradually increased during the study period. This study provided minimum estimates of the ecosystem service values, which willcontribute to the formulation of policy actions and strategies for sustainable management of the Kilombero Valley floodplain and inform various stakeholders on the tradeoffs involved in the use of land resources. © 2020 by the authors.","Benefit transfer approach; Ecosystem services values; Kilombero valley floodplain; Land resource use; Land use/cover change; Landsat images","Banks (bodies of water); Decision trees; Floods; Land use; Mapping; Sustainable development; Water supply; Benefit transfer; Ecosystem services value; Flood plains; Land resources; Land use/cover change; Landsat images; Ecosystems; algorithm; ArcGIS; ecosystem service; floodplain; land cover; land use change; Landsat; satellite data; satellite imagery; Ecosystems; Floods; Land Use; Mapping; Tanzania; Water Supply; Kilombero Valley; Morogoro [Tanzania]; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078516952

This study attempts to fill this gap by developing and empirically testing a conceptual model that highlights the role of carbon strategy in the relationship between board environmental orientation (BEO) and carbon performance. We argue that BEO can directly and indirectly influence carbon performance through carbon strategy. Using structural equation modelling to analyse data consisting of 2,301 U.S. firm-year observations over the 2005–2015 period, we find that the greater the BEO is, the better its carbon performance (i.e., lower greenhouse gas emissions). The results also provide evidence of the mediating effect of carbon strategy on the relationship between BEO and carbon performance. Splitting the sample into high and low carbon-intensive industries shows a partial mediation effect in high carbon-intensive industries and a full mediation effect in low carbon-intensive industries.

We explore opportunities to increase bioenergy potentials from residues while reducing environmental impacts, in line with sustainable intensification. Using the case study of North Rhine-Westphalia in Germany, we employ a spatiotemporally explicit approach combined with stakeholder interviews. First, the interviews identify agronomic and environmental impacts due to the potential reduction in SOC as the most critical challenge associated with enhanced crop residue exploitation. Market and technological challenges and competition with other residue uses are also identified as significant barriers. Second, with the use of agroecosystem modelling and estimations of bioenergy potentials and greenhouse gas emissions till mid-century, we evaluate the ability of agricultural management to tackle the identified agronomic and environmental challenges. Integrated site-specific management based on (a) humus balancing, (b) optimized fertilization and (c) winter soil cover performs better than our reference scenario with respect to all investigated variables. At the regional level, we estimate (a) a 5% increase in technical residue potentials and displaced emissions from substituting fossil fuels by bioethanol, (b) an 8% decrease in SOC losses and associated emissions, (c) an 18% decrease in nitrous oxide emissions, (d) a 37% decrease in mineral fertilizer requirements and emissions from their production and (e) a 16% decrease in nitrate leaching. Results are spatially variable and, despite improvements induced by management, limited amounts of crop residues are exploitable for bioenergy in areas prone to SOC decline. In order to sustainably intensify crop residue exploitation for bioenergy and reconcile climate change mitigation with other sustainability objectives, such as those on soil and water quality, residue management needs to be designed in an integrated and site-specific manner. © 2019 The Authors.

The sequences include island arc volcanic and volcaniclastic rocks (Amisk Group) that are unconformably overlain by subaerial sedimentary rocks (Missi Group), and younger deep facies sediments. In the Flin Flon area, several north–south trending faults divide the sequences into blocks and obscure the depositional environment of the deep facies sediments. Locally, within the Flin Flon area, the Embury Lake Formation is in fault contact with island arc volcanic–sedimentary sequences of the Amisk and Missi Groups. To identify the depositional environment of the Embury Lake Formation, we used lithologic and geochemical approaches. Here, we report carbon isotopic values in organic matter (δ13Corg) and sulfur isotopes (δ34S), as well as total organic carbon and total sulfur measurements for the black shale in the formation. Samples were taken from a drill core that contains alternating bands of sandstone and black shale. Pyrite in the black shale is divided into four textural types: euhedral, vein-type, elliptical, and microcrystalline. Microcrystalline pyrite is typically generated by microbially mediated sulfate reduction. An extremely low S/C ratio (avg. = 0.04) is consistent with lacustrine deposition. The ranges of δ13Corg (−36 ‰ to −27 ‰) and δ34S (+3.0 ‰ to +7.7 ‰) values can be explained by bacterial photosynthesis that involved Calvin cycle and acetyl CoA pathways, and sulfate reduction in a low-sulfate environment. Considering the depositional age reported in a previous study of &lt; 1.84 Ga, the Embury Lake Formation was likely emplaced in a lacustrine setting during the Trans-Hudson Orogeny. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","1.8 Ga; organic carbon and sulfur geochemistry; Paleoproterozoic","carbon isotope; depositional environment; lithology; organic carbon; Proterozoic; sediment chemistry; sedimentary sequence; sulfur; Canada; Flin Flon Belt; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85080988019

The long nineteenth century was a period consistently cooler than now, and Scotland remains the coldest of the British nations. Nineteenth-century meteorologists turned to environmental determinism to explain the persistence of agricultural shortage and to identify the atmospheric conditions that exacerbated the incidence of death and disease in the towns. In these cases, the logic of emigration and the benefits of an alternative climate were compelling. Emigration agents portrayed their favoured climate in order to pull migrants in their direction. The climate reasons, pressures and incentives that resulted in the movement of people have been neither straightforward nor uniform. There are known structural features that contextualize the migration experience, chief among them being economic and demographic factors. By building on the work of historical climatologists, and the availability of long-run climate data, for the first time the emigration history of Scotland is examined through the lens of the nation’s climate.

Here, we argue that current wildfire management policies in MCRs are destined to fail. Focused on fire suppression, these policies largely ignore ongoing climate warming and landscape-scale buildup of fuels. The result is a 'firefighting trap' that contributes to ongoing fuel accumulation precluding suppression under extreme fire weather, and resulting in more severe and larger fires. We believe that a 'business as usual' approach to wildfire in MCRs will not solve the fire problem, and recommend that policy and expenditures be rebalanced between suppression and mitigation of the negative impacts of fire. This requires a paradigm shift: policy effectiveness should not be primarily measured as a function of area burned (as it usually is), but rather as a function of avoided socio-ecological damage and loss. © 2020 The Author(s).

In this study, the lumped model BROOK90 was utilized with input based on the available historical and projected meteorological data, as well as land use and soil information. With this data, we were able to determine the changes in the water balance components in four different regions, representing four different water districts in Eastern Colombia. These four regions reflect four different sets of climate and geographic conditions. The projected data were obtained using the Statistical Downscaling Model (SDSM), in which two global climate models were used in addition to two different climate scenarios from each. These are the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5. Results showed that the temporal and spatial distribution of water balance components were considerably affected by the changing climate. A reduction in the generated streamflow for all of the studied regions is shown and changes in the evapotranspiration and stored water were varied for each region according to both the climate scenario as well as the characteristics of soil and land use for each area. The results of spatial change of the water balance components showed a direct link to the geography of each region.

Operations research techniques have frequently focused on cost minimization objectives in locational planning of municipal solid waste management (MSWM) systems. However, transportation constitutes an integral part of this system producing a considerable amount of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, sustainable management of this system with GHG emissions minimization considerations is necessary to preserve the resources and protect the environment. In this study, a bi-objective optimization model is proposed to minimize system cost and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission resulting from transportation activities in locational planning of MSWM systems. The proposed model is applied to MSWM system of Ankara to introduce transfer stations (TSs). Two extensions of the current system are examined, namely, the extended and hybrid systems, where MSW is only transported through TSs in the former, while direct shipments are also allowed in the latter. For both extensions, it is observed that with no or little increase in cost, considerable savings in emission can be achieved. Simulation analyses show that CO2 emission and cost are not subject to a considerable change due to speed variations of vehicles. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bi-objective optimization; CO2 emission; Facility location; Municipal solid waste management; Sustainable transportation","Bismuth compounds; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Emission control; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hybrid systems; Location; Operations research; Sustainable development; Waste management; Bi-objective optimization; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emissions; Facility locations; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Simulation analysis; Sustainable management; Sustainable transportation; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072573440

Small-scale drainage systems in this mountain range are mostly isolated from river networks and associated processes originating in the Precordillera or the High Andes to the east, thus providing natural laboratories to investigate the interplay between erosion, atmospheric deposition, tectonics and local (micro-) climatic conditions. In this study, we present a set of cosmogenic 10Be and 26Al derived, catchment-wide erosion rates along a short (2.5 km) E-W transect on the northern rim of the Río Loa Canyon in the Coastal Cordillera of northern Chile (latitude 21.4°S). Here, a flat sedimentary gravel surface, which was deposited before the Middle Miocene, becomes increasingly dissected and changes into a badland-like topography to the west. The 10Be erosion rates increase by approximately an order of magnitude from east to west, reflecting (1) localised tectonic movements, (2) geologically recent base level lowering, (3) time-integrated (micro-) climatic gradients and (4) the presence/absence of gypcrete. These findings are corroborated by analysis of geomorphologic parameters, which point towards the presence of two fundamentally different erosional regimes in this small study area. These regimes are sharply delineated along a topographically modest tectonic ridge. To the west, a detachment-limited erosion regime prevails, while in the east a transport-limited regime is dominant. The presence or absence of gypcrete, whose prevalence is governed by (micro-) climatic conditions, generally appears to reflect the respective erosional regimes. The erosion rates we infer point to a long-term process of differential drainage evolution in the study area, likely on timescales of millions of years. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Atacama Desert; Cosmogenic nuclides; Crust; Erosion; Geomorphology; Gypsum","Catchments; Geomorphology; Gypsum; Landforms; Meteorological problems; Tectonics; Topography; Atacama Desert; Atmospheric depositions; Climatic conditions; Climatic gradients; Cosmogenic nuclides; Crust; Natural laboratories; Tectonic movements; Erosion; climate change; climate conditions; continental crust; cosmogenic radionuclide; crust; geomorphology; gravel; gypsum; microclimate; river system; soil erosion; Andes; Atacama Desert; Chile; Coastal Cordillera; Precordillera",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074748940

However, the performance is not up to the mark due to the absence of highly efficient and stable electrocatalysts. Recently, both 2D-matrix and single-atom catalysts (SACs) are two intense research topics in the field of electrocatalysis due to the high activity and stability and to maximize the utilization efficiency. Engineering the materials from 3D to 2D and modification from nanoparticles to single atoms have created a significant enhancement in the electrocatalytic activity. Hybridizing both the 2D matrix and SACs (2DM@SACs) creates a new electronic state in the materials, and that bequeaths with enhancing potentials toward the electrocatalytic activity. The strong covalent interaction between the 2D matrix and SACs tunes the intrinsic activity of the electrocatalysts. In this mini-review, we have discussed the different synthesis methods of 2DM@SACs with a focus on their electrochemical energy applications such as hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, oxygen reduction, and carbon dioxide reduction. This mini-review appraises the contribution to the rational proposal for the synthesis of perfect 2DM@SAC catalysts with their electrochemical properties toward energy conversion applications. © 2020 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078095761

Thus far, the micromodel investigation of LSWF has been limited to sandstones, remaining challenging to apply to carbonates. In this paper we aim to i) extend the capability to fabricate a novel calcite micromodel using Iceland spar calcite crystal, ii) investigate the pore-scale mechanisms leading to oil recovery from carbonates. A target crude oil-brine-rock (COBR) system was first selected. To screen potential brines which can produce low-salinity-effect (LSE) and to guide the design of the micromodel experiments, contact angle measurements were carried out using two methods: i) contact angle under fixed, and ii) under dynamic salinity condition. The micromodel displacement experiments were then performed by flooding an oil saturated model with high salinity water followed by low salinity water injection to displace the high salinity water and observe any potential changes to the configuration and saturation of the residual oil. Additionally, the effect of connate water presence on the efficiency of LSE was investigated. To account for the time effects of the low salinity process, the experiments were monitored for an extended time period in order of several days to a month. For the COBR system studied in the micromodel, the results clearly show that when brine salinity is lowered the microscopic sweep efficiency is improved; providing a direct in-situ evidence for wettability alteration to a more water-wetting state. The presence of connate water enhanced the efficiency of LSWF both in terms of speed (time-scale) and quantity of oil recovery. It is postulated that in the presence of connate water an initial water-film around the calcite surface is present which facilitates the diffusive transport of brine ions when low salinity is injected. Thus it is favorable to have an initial water film present; a case for mixed-wettability. We observed that the oil production was non-instantaneous characterized by a prolonged induction time and a slow “layer-by-layer” recovery either from the pore body or throat wall; a process we refer to as “peel-off”. Before the oil can be removed from the calcite surface, de-wetting (or de-pinning) patterns were formed which grew and coalesced toward formation of a clearly visible larger pattern. Ultimately, the remaining oil under low salinity was comparatively much less compared to the end of high salinity step. The observed mechanism of the oil recovery and the slow associated time have direct implications for the pore-scale simulation of the process and upscaling to Darcy-scale, and the design of laboratory experiments to avoid false negative results. They would also likely imply lack of a clear oil-bank observation at core scale. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Calcite micromodel; Carbonate EOR; Contact angle; Low salinity waterflooding; Pore-scale physics; Wettability alteration","Calcite; Contact angle; Efficiency; Enhanced recovery; Floods; Petroleum industry; Secondary recovery; Spar platforms; Wetting; Diffusive transport; Displacement experiments; Laboratory experiments; Low salinity; Microscopic mechanisms; Pore scale; Pore-scale simulation; Wettability alteration; Oil well flooding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073238081

Analyses by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) for the bulk crystals indicate that annealing in the temperature range of 58-100 °C may be appropriate to improve the order in the LB film. The polarized light microscopy measurement further revealed that a spherulite structure was formed after the film was annealed at 80 °C for 60 min. FT-IR spectroscopy measurements demonstrated that the order of the principal hydrocarbon chains was improved and that the rotation of CH3 groups was hindered by the annealing. Out-of-plane XRD analyses revealed that the d-spacing of the 2C14N+Me2-Au(dmit)2 LB film changed from 3.1 to 2.5 nm upon annealing. We hypothesize that a layered structure with interdigitated hydrocarbon chains, which is equivalent to or close to that of the corresponding bulk crystal, has been realized in the LB film by annealing. We consider that two different kinds of one-dimensional (1D) interactions along the a-axis are the driving forces to realize the spherulite structure in the LB system; one is an extended 1D contact due to the pronounced interdigitation of the alkyl chains of the ammonium ion, which plays a role similar to that of the folding of chains in the lamellar structures of polymers, and the other is a 1D extended sulfur-sulfur contact between Au(dmit)2 dimer pairs. So far, spherulite formation in LB films has been reported almost exclusively for polymerized materials. Here, we demonstrate that a spherulite texture can also be formed in LB films based on nonpolymerized materials via the interdigitation of hydrocarbon chains, leading to a new well-ordered state. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Annealing; Crystal structure; Differential scanning calorimetry; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydrocarbons; Lamellar structures; Light polarization; Polymers; Sulfur; Textures; Fourier transform infra red (FTIR) spectroscopy; Hydrocarbon chains; Langmuir-blodgett; Layered Structures; Polymerized material; Spherulite formation; Spherulitic crystallization; Sulfur-sulfur contacts; Langmuir Blodgett films",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078377332

It has long been known that forest trees are closely associated with microorganisms, but a comprehensive description of the tree associated microbiome (hereafter referred to as plant microbiome) extending beyond the relatively well-studied root mutualists, and the understanding of its functional role is largely missing. In our viewpoint, we argue that a more comprehensive consideration of the plant microbiome, especially that of the so far neglected phyllosphere and endosphere will substantially increase the understanding of fundamental ecological processes in forest ecosystems. An explicit tree community-level approach is particularly missing in the current research efforts. Because plants and their microbiome are inseparable entities forming the plant holobiont, they may collectively determine plant community assembly, diversity, functional traits, and resulting ecosystem processes to a much stronger degree than is currently acknowledged. Here, we aim to highlight the so far underestimated importance of the plant microbiome for the structure and functioning of forest ecosystems. More specifically, we emphasize the functional diversity of the plant microbiome for a better understanding of tree community dynamics and the resulting consequences for ecosystem functioning, which appears particularly important with ongoing global change. By providing a general context of the current limitation of knowledge and indicating some specific research areas that need more attention in the future, we hope that our contribution may help in identifying current research needs and stimulate future research. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ecosystem functioning; Endosphere; Forest ecosystems; Functional diversity; Phyllosphere; Plant holobiont; Rhizosphere; Tree community dynamics",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071868472

While improved efficiency of cement use has been proposed as a means to mitigate these burdens, the effects of increasing longevity of cement in-use remains a poorly studied area. This work quantitatively explores the implications of using cement for a longer in-use residence times. Specifically, this work uses dynamic material flow analysis models to quantify the in-use stock of cement in the United States from 1900 to 2015. With these models, the implications of increasing or decreasing mean longevity of in-use cement on required cement production, demand for batching water, aggregates, and energy for cement-based materials, and GHG emissions are quantified. This work shows that a 50% increase in cement longevity could have led to a 14% reduction in material resource demand and GHG emissions from concrete production in the United States, equivalent to 0.28 to 0.83 Gt of batching water, 2.9 to 7.6 Gt of aggregates, 1E + 06 to 2.3E + 06 TJ of energy, and 0.4 to 0.7 Gt of CO2-eq emissions. This percent reduction exceeds goals for reducing GHG emissions through alternative energy resources, suggesting improving durability and longevity of in-use cement stock could be a critical means to mitigating environmental impacts. © 2020 The Author(s).

We investigated the influence of desert dust outbreaks on air quality in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, a city located in the dust export pathway off the west coast of North Africa, using air-quality observations from a six-year period (2012-2017). During winter intense dust outbreaks PM10 mean (24-h) concentrations increased from 14 μg m-3 to 98 μg m-3, on average, and PM2.5 mean (24-h) concentrations increased from 6 μg m-3 to 32 μg m-3. Increases were less during summer outbreaks, with a tripling of PM10 and PM2.5 daily mean concentrations. We found that desert dust outbreaks reduced the height of the marine boundary layer in our study area by &gt;45%, on average, in summer and by 25%, on average, in winter. This thinning of the marine boundary layer was associated with an increase of local anthropogenic pollution during dust outbreaks. NO2 and NO mean concentrations more than doubled and even larger relative increases in black carbon were observed during the more intense summer dust outbreaks; increases also occurred during the winter outbreaks but were less than in summer. This has public health implications; local anthropogenic emissions need to be reduced even further in areas that are impacted by desert dust outbreaks to reduce adverse health effects. © 2019 by the authors.","Air quality; Anthropogenic pollution; Desert dust; Particulate matter","Air quality; Boundary layers; Health; Health risks; Landforms; Marine pollution; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Adverse health effects; Anthropogenic emissions; Anthropogenic pollution; Desert dust; Health implications; Marine boundary layers; Mean concentrations; Particulate Matter; Dust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079651518

Exploration of soil fungal communities in pollution gradients serves the remediation interests and brings fundamental knowledge about biota response to environmental changes. In this work, using industrial pollution as a model of environmental filtering, we performed high-throughput sequencing of 180 soil samples collected along strong long-term pollution gradients in spruce-fir and birch-pine forests. Based on 1008 Agaricomycetes operational taxonomic units, we found that in unpolluted forests, communities were randomly assembled in deep phylogenetic branches and clustered at the terminal branches. Pollution caused a 32–43% reduction in Agaricomycetes richness, resulting in the phylogenetic diversity decrease and phylogenetic clustering. The Auriculariales, Thelephorales, Phallomycetidae, Typhuloid, Marasmioid, and Tricholomatoid clades were sensitive to pollution, while Agaricoid clade, Boletales, and Russulales were tolerant, evidencing a phylogenetic signal of tolerance to pollution. To compare the trophic guilds’ response to pollution, we performed phylogenetically-informed and uninformed modeling. Both approaches showed that biotrophs were more tolerant compared to saprotrophs at different taxonomic levels, illustrating that trophic mode determines fungal response to pollution or is associated with biochemical traits underlying tolerance to heavy metal excess and soil acidification. The shift in the proportions of fungal trophic guilds, which differ in the pathways and intensity of organic matter transformation, determines carbon and nitrogen dynamics in polluted lands and the rate of ecosystem restoration after the reduction of emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Community phylogenetics; Ectomycorrhizal fungi; Environmental filtering; Heavy metals; Phylogenetic diversity; Phylogenetically-informed modeling","Ecosystems; Forestry; Fungi; Heavy metals; Reduction; Soils; Ecosystem restoration; Ectomycorrhizal fungi; High-throughput sequencing; Operational taxonomic units; Phylogenetic diversity; Phylogenetics; Reduction of emissions; Soil fungal communities; Pollution control; chemical pollutant; community dynamics; coniferous forest; ectomycorrhiza; environmental change; fungus; guild; heavy metal; industrial emission; long-term change; phylogenetics; pollution effect; pollution tolerance; soil pollution; species richness; Abies; Agaricales; Auriculariales; Boletales; Fungi; Picea; Thelephorales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074434777

Myanmar, one of the world's least developed countries may face accelerating deforestation under an open and democratic political system that desires rapid economic development. This research analyzes the impacts of population growth and economic development on forest areas in Myanmar by using panel data analysis, an econometrics approach based on panel data of forest areas, population, and gross domestic product (GDP) by states and regions in 2005, 2010, and 2015. This research revealed that per capita GDP and population density gave statistically significant negative impacts on forest areas. Using the regression model obtained above, medium population growth projections, and three GDP development scenarios, annual forest areas from 2016 to 2020 were forecast. The forecasting results showed possible higher deforestation under higher economic development. Finally, this research showed the necessity of adjusting the current average deforestation for RELs in the REDD+ scheme in Myanmar and the direction in which the adjustment should go. © 2020 by the authors.","Deforestation; Forecast; GDP; Myanmar; Panel data analysis; Population","Data handling; Deforestation; Economic and social effects; Economics; Information analysis; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Development scenarios; Economic development; Gross domestic products; Least-developed countries; Myanmars; Panel data analysis; Population; Socio-economic factor; Forecasting; deforestation; econometrics; economic development; forecasting method; forest cover; Gross Domestic Product; panel data; political system; population growth; socioeconomic conditions; Data Processing; Deforestation; Economics; Forecasts; Regression Analysis; United Nations; Myanmar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078540769

Proper management of the water resources in agriculture, and taking appropriate action or avoiding inappropriate activities in this area could significantly reduce anthropogenic stress and thus have a positive impact on the ecohydrology of the country. Questions arise about whether state regulations and the activities of government institutions support farms in the effective management of water resources, There are also questions about how farmers deal with the challenges of water management that result from climate change. In order to answer these questions, the following research tools were used: analysis of existing data, a review of the literature and legal acts, as well as a quantitative research method – a questionnaire. The study shows that despite the lack of – or negligible – support of government institutions, Polish farmers are trying to cope with the consequences of climate change on water management themselves; this is especially true for large and medium-sized agricultural enterprises. However, the farmers still have not realized that their individual decisions reduce the economic efficiency of their production but that they also negatively impact ecosystems, hydrology, and other economic entities whose activity depends on the quality of the water resource. © 2019","Adaptation policy; Agricultural; Climate change; Ecohydrology; Water management","agricultural worker; agriculture; climate change; coping strategy; ecohydrology; entrepreneur; governance approach; institutional framework; irrigation; water management; Poland [Central Europe]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077518372

Therefore, it has been recommended that Earth System Models (ESMs) participating in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 report predicted radiocarbon values for relevant carbon pools. However, a detailed representation of radiocarbon dynamics may be an impractical burden on model developers. Here, we present an alternative approach to compute radiocarbon values from the numerical output of an ESM that does not explicitly represent these dynamics. The approach requires computed 12C stocks and fluxes among all carbon pools for a particular simulation of the model. From this output, a time-dependent linear compartmental system is computed with its respective state-transition matrix. Using transient atmospheric 14C values as inputs, the state-transition matrix is then applied to compute radiocarbon values for each pool, the average value for the entire system, and component fluxes. We demonstrate the approach with ELMv1-ECA, the land component of an ESM model that explicitly represents 12C, and 14C in 7 soil pools and 10 vertical layers. Results from our proposed method are highly accurate (relative error &lt;0.01%) compared with the ELMv1-ECA 12C and 14C predictions, demonstrating the potential to use this approach in CMIP6 and other model simulations that do not explicitly represent 14C. © 2019.

We estimate the increase in US corn and soybean yields attributed to the recent dramatic reductions in emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from electric power plants. In response to the observed changes in power plant NOx emissions over the eight-year period from 2003–05 to 2011–13, we estimate that average corn yields improved by 2.46% and soybean yields by 1.62%. These improvements imply an increase in total surplus of $1.60 billion annually across the two crops. The estimated yield improvements vary substantially across states depending on the change in NOx emissions. For corn, they range from 0.32% to 6.87% and for soybeans, they range from 0.21% to 4.30%. The demand for the two crops is quite inelastic, which means that prices decrease by more than production increases in response to this positive productivity shock and the implied rightward shift of the crop supply curve. Due to the low elasticities of supply and demand for U.S. corn and soybeans, we conclude from a welfare analysis that these changes made consumers better off and farmers worse off. © The Author(s) 2019.

Measurements of CH4 isotopic composition are used to partition the relative contributions of different emission sources. We report continuous isotopic measurements during 5 months at the Lutjewad tower (north of the Netherlands). Time-series of χ(CH4), δ13C-CH4, and δD-CH4 in ambient air were analysed using the Keeling plot method. Resulting source signatures ranged from −67.4 to −52.4‰ vs V-PDB and from −372 to −211‰ vs V-SMOW, for δ13C and δD respectively, indicating a prevalence of biogenic sources. Analysis of isotope and wind data indicated that (i) emissions from off-shore oil and gas platforms in the North Sea were not detected during this period, (ii) CH4 from fossil fuel related sources was usually advected from the east, pointing towards the Groningen gas field or regions further east in Germany. The results from two atmospheric transport models, CHIMERE and FLEXPART-COSMO, using the EDGAR v4.3.2 and TNO-MACC III emission inventories, reproduce χ(CH4) variations relatively well, but the isotope signatures were over-estimated by the model compared to the observations. Accounting for geographical variations of the δ13C signatures from fossil fuel emissions improved the model results significantly. The difference between model and measured isotopic signatures was larger when using TNO-MACC III compared to EDGAR v4.3.2 inventory. Uncertainties in the isotope signatures of the sources could explain a significant fraction of the discrepancy, thus a better source characterisation could further strengthen the use of isotopes in constraining emissions. © 2020 The Author(s).

The analysis reveals that the introduction of the Sponge City Plan has changed the role of planning from onlooker to active participant in the arena of flood governance.

In many studies, TiO2 has been successfully used as a photocatalyst for CO2 reduction, but there is still a lack of understanding of its catalytic behavior. In this context, CO2 reduction has been studied on nanoporous TiO2 electrodes in acetonitrile media by means of (spectro) electrochemical methods (ATR-IR and UV-vis). Importantly, the onset of the cathodic Faradaic processes related with CO2 reduction on TiO2 electrodes is located at -0.81 V versus SHE, which is less negative than that observed for metal electrodes under similar conditions. UV-vis spectroelectrochemical results indicate that the electrocatalytic behavior of TiO2 is related to the generation of oxygen vacancies and Ti3+ sites at its surface and promoted by electrolytes with nonintercalating cations in agreement with recent results on WO3 electrodes. ATR-IR spectroelectrochemical measurements allow for monitoring of the TiO2/solution interfacial state as reduction proceeds. Specifically, IR bands for carbon monoxide and carbonyl groups related with carbonate and oxalate are observed. Additionally, a chromatographic analysis shows CO and oxalate as main products. With controlled water addition (0.5 M), methanol and CO were found to be the main products.

This review is part of the studies carried out on the integral use of wood industrial wastes due to its low costs and high availability. A possible high-value product is ethylene, obtained by catalytic dehydration of second-generation bioethanol from lignocellulosic materials and which can be an effective alternative for the production of polymers such as polyethylene (PE), which is conventionally obtained from petroleum. Biobased polyethylene or biopolyethylene (BioPE) may potentially contribute to close a pine biorefinery scheme to obtain high-value products, using processes of low pollution and contributing to the global environmental balance. The process involves the following stages: pretreatment, enzymatic saccharification, fermentation, dehydration, and polymerization. This review includes the different processes for second generation (2G) bioethylene productions from pine wastes as an example and the technologies that can potentially be applied on an industrial scale for BioPE production, focusing on the catalytic dehydration of 2G bioethanol through the use of catalysts able to achieve high ethanol conversions and ethylene selectivity. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Bioethylene; Biopolyethylene; Biorefinery; Heterogeneous catalysis; Lignocellulosic biomass","Bioethanol; Catalysis; Catalyst selectivity; Climate change; Costs; Dehydration; Ethanol; Ethylene; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Polyethylenes; Refining; Renewable energy resources; Saccharification; Sustainable development; Bio-ethylene; Biopolyethylene; Biorefineries; Enzymatic saccharification; Lignocellulosic biomass; Lignocellulosic material; Renewable energy source; Second generation bioethanol; Industrial wastes; biomass; catalysis; cellulose; ethylene; industrial waste; lignin; polymer; wood",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074581357

In this paper, we present four indices of the monthly frequency of wind direction, one for each cardinal direction: Northerly (NI), Easterly (EI), Southerly (SI) and Westerly (WI), based on daily wind direction observations taken aboard ships over the English Channel. These Directional Indices (DIs) are the longest observational record of atmospheric circulation to date at the daily scale, covering the 1685–2014 period. DIs anomalies are associated with near-surface climatic signals over large areas of Europe in all seasons, with zonal indices (WI and EI) and meridional indices (NI and SI) often affecting different regions. Statistical models including all DIs are able to explain a considerable amount of European climate variability, in most cases higher than that accounted for by the North Atlantic Oscillation. As such, the DIs are able to reproduce the known European climatic history and provide new insights of certain episodes from monthly to multi-decadal time scales such as the warm winter decade of 1730–1739 or the extremely cold 1902 summer. The DIs show the potential to better constrain the atmospheric circulation response to external forcings and its associated anomalies. In particular, we provide first observational evidences of all year-round atmospheric circulation signals following the strongest tropical volcanic eruptions of the last three centuries. These signatures are more complex than previously thought and suggest that the well-reported winter warming and summer cooling cannot be simply interpreted in terms of changes in zonality. © 2019, The Author(s).","Atmospheric circulation index; Climate variability; Early instrumental data; North Atlantic Oscillation; Ships’ logbooks","air-sea interaction; atmospheric circulation; cooling; frequency analysis; North Atlantic Oscillation; summer; wind direction; wind velocity; winter; zonal wind; English Channel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074819460

But alleviations of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are more nuanced, due to many factors, including the car's battery range. We use GPS-based trip data to determine use type-specific, GHG-optimized ranges. The dataset comprises 412 cars and 384,869 individual trips in Ann Arbor, Michigan, USA. We use previously developed algorithms to determine driver types, such as using the car to commute or not. Calibrating an existing life cycle GHG model to a forecast, low-carbon grid for Ann Arbor, we find that the optimum range varies not only with the drive train architecture (plugin-hybrid versus battery-only) and charging technology (fast versus slow) but also with the driver type. Across the 108 scenarios we investigated, the range that yields lowest GHG varies from 65 km (55+ year old drivers, ultrafast charging, plugin-hybrid) to 158 km (16–34 year old drivers, overnight charging, battery-only). The optimum GHG reduction that electric cars offer – here conservatively measured versus gasoline-only hybrid cars – is fairly stable, between 29% (16–34 year old drivers, overnight charging, battery-only) and 46% (commuters, ultrafast charging, plugin-hybrid). The electrification of total distances is between 66% and 86%. However, if cars do not have the optimum range, these metrics drop substantially. We conclude that matching the range to drivers’ typical trip distances, charging technology, and drivetrain is a crucial pre-requisite for electric vehicles to achieve their highest potential to reduce GHG emissions in personal transportation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","All electric range; Electric vehicles; Electrification of transport; GPS data; Greenhouse gas emissions; Life cycle assessment; Personal transportation; Trip distances","Charging (batteries); Digital storage; Driver training; Electric utilities; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Global positioning system; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; People movers; Petroleum transportation; Vehicles; Electric range; Electrification of transport; GPS data; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Personal transportation; Trip distances; Secondary batteries; algorithm; calibration; data set; electric vehicle; electrification; emission control; GPS; greenhouse gas; Ann Arbor; Michigan; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077033441

Most of the cities in China suffered from extremely high air pollution levels and cannot meet the national air quality standards. In this study, we attempt to measure individuals’ average marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) in Beijing with the hedonic price model. We combine an extensive housing transaction dataset with emission data of six air pollutants from 2013 to 2016 in Beijing, China. When estimating the hedonic price function, we apply both ordinary least squares (OLS) and panel model with various fixed effects to better control for unobservables. The empirical results reveal that the concentrations of CO, NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 are significantly negatively correlated with housing prices. However, we found an insignificant relationship with the concentration of SO2 and the concentration of O3 appears to positively increase the housing values.

Using substantial carrier manifest datasets, this paper demonstrates advantages from rival carriers collaborating using a “carrier’s carrier” operating model for their last-mile parcel logistics operations. Under these circumstances, a single carrier undertakes all the deliveries within a defined area on behalf of the carriers instead of them working independently. Modelling the daily delivery activity of five parcel carriers working over a 3.7 km2 area of central London, comprising around 3000 items being delivered to around 900 delivery locations, and consolidating their activity through a single carrier suggested that time, distance and associated vehicle emissions savings of around 60% could be achieved over the current business-as-usual operation. This equated to a reduction in the number of delivery vans and drivers needed from 33 to 13, with annual savings of 39,425 h, 176,324 km driven, 52,721 kg CO2 and 56.4 kg NOx. Reliance on vans and associated vehicle emissions could be reduced further by using cargo cycles alongside vans for the last-mile delivery, with estimated annual emissions savings increasing to 72,572 kg CO2 and 77.7 kg NOx. The results indicated that consolidation of items for delivery in this way would be especially beneficial to business-to-consumer (B2C) carriers whose parcel profiles comprise relatively small and light items. One of the key barriers to the wider take up of such services by individual carriers is the loss of individual brand identity that can result from operating through a carrier’s carrier. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",,"Carbon dioxide; Nitrogen oxides; Activity patterns; Brand identity; Business-as-usual; Business-to-consumer; Logistics operations; Operating models; Single carrier; Vehicle emission; Trucks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094881297

Based on recent urban climate resilience and land tenure research conducted for the United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN-Habitat) and the Global Land Tool Network (GLTN) respectively, the paper analyses land issues in two informal settlements in Honiara to highlight the inter-linkages between security of land tenure and climate vulnerability, and how insecure land tenure adversely impacts local adaptive capacity and adaptation planning. This analysis is embedded in the context of the South Pacific region, where duality tensions exist between Western-influenced land tenure arrangements within cities - a legacy of colonial times - and customary arrangements that operate in the surrounding peri-urban and provincial areas. Given the identification of strong links between security of land tenure and climate vulnerability, and the complexity of property rights in the region, the paper argues that principles of good land governance are an essential component of climate resilience thinking and actions. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change; land tenure; Small island developing states; urban resilience; vulnerability","climate change; ecosystem resilience; island state; land tenure; periurban area; property rights; urban climate; urbanization; vulnerability; Guadalcanal; Honiara; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (South); Solomon Islands [(ISG) Melanesia]; Solomon Islands [Solomon Islands (ISG)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064049163

However, health outcomes in the early stages are expected to be similar to the health outcomes associated with refugees. The objective of the present study was a systematic review of the health effects of migration caused by climate change. METHODOLOGY: A systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Online databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) were used to identify papers published that evaluated the health effects of migration caused by climate change. The search, article selection, and data extraction were carried out by two researchers independently. All English-language articles on the health effects of migration caused by climate change were included in this study. RESULTS: An analysis of the complex ways in which climate change influences populations can be facilitated using a three-class classification: compulsory displacement, resettlement planning, and migration. Subsequent to climate changes, other changes, and environmental deficiencies, compulsory displacement may occur in case of inadequacy of compatibility responses. A part of migration-related health outcomes caused by climate change is from displacement from rural to urban areas, especially in developing countries. There is significant documentation on health and livelihood inequalities between migrant groups and host populations in developed countries. CONCLUSION: If climate change continues in its current direction, it is likely that the number of refugees and crises will increase in the coming decades. Although the domain and the extent of health hazards caused by the displacement of the population associated with climate change cannot be clearly predicted, by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, along with social and environmental adaptation strategies, migration caused by climate change, health risks and its relevant crises can be greatly reduced. © 2020 Journal of Education and Health Promotion | Published by Wolters Kluwer - Medknow.","Climate change; health; human migration; population dynamics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085614780

Type approval tests have been performed on chassis dynamometer in order to evaluate the emission factors and fuel consumption for passenger cars. Standardized procedures such as the FTP-75 proposed in the United States (currently incorporated in the Brazilian legislation) and the Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC), a transient driving cycle model designed by the European Union to overcome the shortcomings of the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC), are discussed in this paper. Both cycles were performed in a chassis dynamometer with a flex-fuel passenger car running on ethanol blend (E92W08). The driver, vehicle and fuel were kept constant so the comparison between the cycles would not be compromised. The vehicle chosen was a 1.4 dm3 displaced volume FIAT sedan with maximum power of 60 kW at 5500 rpm and maximum torque of 122 Nm at 2250 rpm. The cycle dynamics and the engine operation points were assessed in this paper. The five points estimated as the most representative of both tests were selected for steady-state investigations conducted using hydrous-ethanol (E97W03), which is the ethanol blend in Brazilian fuel stations. These points were evaluated in terms of fuel consumption and air excess factor. The results showed that the FTP-75 demanded greater average and maximum acceleration values, implying on more aggressive driving conditions. The WLTC presented a more homogeneous acceleration per speed diagram, providing higher average speed and speed standard deviation (e.g. more transient conditions) which is more like the real drive conditions. It could be seen that the WLTC covers a wider range of engine operation conditions holding more dispersed points than the FTP-75. In addition, the WLTC contained points with higher load, which made the results for fuel consumption to be higher compared to FTP-75. The engine operation points provided by the FTP-75 were excessively condensed. Therefore, it could be concluded that the FTP-75 can be a predictable test with repeated points of operation. The WLTC does not have sufficient number of trips in its schedule, which is different from the behavior expected in real-world driving conditions. Also, it could be observed that depending on the test specifications the driver can largely influence the performance of the vehicle. © 2019 SAE International.

A novel computational methodology is implemented to help the sustainable integration of parabolic trough collectors photothermal technology into the low and medium enthalpy industrial activities. A multivariate artificial neural network that involves environmental, operational, and economic aspects was used to transfer the phenomenon under study into a simple and fast computing multi-output mathematical model. The optimal trade-off between environmental benefits and investment viability of the hybrid solar plant's design is obtained by a multi-objective optimization process. The objective functions consider the maximization in CO2 mitigation and net present value, and the minimization of the total life-cycle cost. The final optimal result is selected by using the TOPSIS decision-making method. Besides, a sensitivity analysis is conducted to report the system performance with respect to back-up boiler fuel type, climate region, the volume of the storage tank, and solar field area. The work contemplates the case study of a solar thermal plant based on parabolic collectors integrated into a pre-existing industrial process in Mexico. The study considered four of the most common climatic regions and the most representative heating fossil fuels in the national industrial sector. Based on the results, the best profitability and CO2 mitigation are achieved in warm climate regions. Moreover, diesel was identified as the most profitable back-up fuel scenario and natural gas as the least viable. Analysis of the energy contribution describes that implementation of parabolic trough collectors in the presented industrial process covers just over 40%–80% of the energy required, depending on the climate region. The presented methodology constitutes a rapid and low-cost computational tool which facilitates decision making for the implementation of solar heat industrial process systems. Moreover, it can be applied to other industrial processes with several photothermal technologies for clean heat generation. © 2019","Clean heat production; Decision-making method; Industrial process; Multi-objective optimization; Solar thermal; Surrogate models","Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Heat generation; Investments; Life cycle; Multiobjective optimization; Natural gasoline plants; Neural networks; Profitability; Sensitivity analysis; Solar collectors; Solar heating; Decision-making method; Heat production; Industrial processs; Solar thermal; Surrogate model; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072654053

Here, a simulation-based method evaluates management options that increase median (50th percentile) SHP dryland sorghum yields and estimates those practice's yield risk effects. This method generates climate-representative distributions of grain yields via a crop model driven by weather inputs from 21 SHP weather stations during 2005–2016. Optimal management practices for current SHP climate conditions were sought by generating yield distributions under 32 management options defined by four planting dates, four plant densities, and applied or no applied N. The highest median grain yields resulted from management options with the latest planting date (July 5) and the lowest plant density (24.7 K plants ha−1), while applied N had essentially no yield effect. Increased yields with later planting dates are consistent with sorghum's growth cycle and SHP summer rainfall climatology. Confirming the low plant density yield effect may require additional field studies, as supporting evidence of higher yields at lower densities from other SHP field and modeling studies is inconclusive. These crop simulations, however, suggest late June to early July planting as part of management practices that maximize yields in dryland SHP sorghum production. © Copyright © 2020 Mauget, Kothari, Leiker, Emendack, Xin, Hayes, Ale and Louis Baumhardt.","agricultural risk management; climate-optimal agricultural management; dryland sorghum production; DSSAT CERES-sorghum; managing to climatology; U.S. southern high plains",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079068948

While they have been extensively used for studying temperature and precipitation, only recently regional climate models (RCMs) arrived at horizontal resolutions that allow studies of snow in complex mountain terrain. Here, we present an evaluation of the snow variables in theWorld Climate Research Program Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (EURO-CORDEX) RCMs with gridded observations of snow cover (from MODIS remote sensing) and temperature and precipitation (E-OBS), as well as with point (station) observations of snow depth and temperature for the European Alps. Large scale snow cover dynamics were reproduced well with some over-and under-estimations depending on month and RCM. The orography, temperature, and precipitation mismatches could on average explain 31% of the variability in snow cover bias across grid-cells, and even more than 50% in the winter period November-April. Biases in average monthly snow depth were remarkably low for reanalysis driven RCMs (<approx. 30 cm), and large for the GCM driven ones (up to 200 cm), when averaged over all stations within 400 m of altitude difference with RCM orography. Some RCMs indicated low snow cover biases and at the same time high snow depth biases, and vice versa. In summary, RCMs showed good skills in reproducing alpine snow cover conditions with regard to their limited horizontal resolution. Detected shortcomings in the models depended on the considered snow variable, season and individual RCM. © 2020 by the authors.","Alps; Climate change; MODIS snow cover; Mountain climate; Station snow depth","Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Remote sensing; Snow; Snow melting systems; Alpine snow; Climate research; European Alps; Future climate; Horizontal resolution; Regional climate models; Regional downscaling; Snow-cover dynamics; Climate models; air temperature; climate modeling; complex terrain; orography; precipitation (climatology); regional climate; snow cover; Alps; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084333240

Implementation of a sewer diversion provided the opportunity to compare the effectiveness of magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)2) and two biological dosing compounds (Bioproducts A and B), with different modes of action (MOA), in a field-test across a large sewer network. Mg(OH)2 increases sewer pH allowing suppression of H2S release into the sewer environment while Bioproduct A acts to disrupt microbial communication through quorum sensing (QS), reducing biofilm integrity. Bioproduct B reduces H2S odors by scouring the sewer of fats, oils and grease (FOGs), which provide adhesion points for the microbial biofilm. Results revealed that only Mg(OH)2 altered the microbial community structure and reduced H2S emissions in a live sewer system, whilst Bioproducts A and B did not reduce H2S emissions or have an observable effect on the composition of the microbial community at the dosed site. Study results recommend in situ testing of dosing treatments before implementation across an operational system. © 2019","Biological dosing treatments; Hydrogen sulfide; Magnesium hydroxide; Microbial ecology; Microbially induced concrete corrosion; Sulfate-reducing bacteria","Biofilms; Ecology; Hydrogen sulfide; Hydrogen sulfide removal (water treatment); Microorganisms; Odors; Oils and fats; Sewers; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur determination; Biological dosing treatments; Concrete corrosion; Magnesium hydroxide; Microbial ecology; Sulfate reducing bacteria; Magnesium compounds; concrete; corrosion; emission; hydrogen sulfide; hydroxide; magnesium; microbial community; microbial ecology; sulfate-reducing bacterium; waste treatment; hydrogen sulfide; chemistry; microbiology; microflora; pH; procedures; sewage; Hydrogen Sulfide; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Microbiota; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068076618

Considering the availability of biomass resources in the state and advent of emerging technologies like torrefaction, biomass-based feedstocks could be directly used in existing coal-based power plants. We performed economic and environmental analyses of electricity derived from nine feedstocks (loblolly pine, corn stover, cotton stalks, bermudagrass, switchgrass, napier grass, giant reed, energycane, and miscanthus) over 25 years relative to coal-based electricity in Georgia. We assumed processing biomass via torrefaction before using the same to substitute coal at the power plant. Pine chips were the least expensive ($113 MWh−1) and the least GHG intensive (134 kg CO2e MWh−1) option for generating electricity, with the lowest abatement cost ($17 t CO2e−1). Based on sensitivity analysis, the abatement cost could be as low as $8 t CO2e−1 for a 900 MW power plant, the most common capacity of coal-based electricity generating units in Georgia. Between the two agricultural residues, cotton stalk ($26 t CO2e−1) had a lower abatement cost than corn stover ($34 t CO2e−1). Among perennial grasses, switchgrass and giant reed had the lowest carbon abatement cost (about $25 t CO2e−1) because of their low unit production cost of electricity.

Since the building sector has emerged as a large energy consumer, in an effort to combat this trend, governments worldwide introduced various policies. The utilization of solar energy conversion systems are at the forefront of attention as they are considered carbon dioxide neutral and can be used in order to cover both electricity and heating load demands. Thus, these systems need to be thoroughly investigated taking into consideration the variations in the solar potential and the differences that exist in the electricity mix throughout Europe both in terms of cost, as well as of emissions, in order to assess their sustainability. In the current work a complete life cycle impact assessment is conducted for typical 4 kWp photovoltaic systems throughout Europe, and their environmental impact, sustainability, energy return on energy invested and payback period are calculated. The results highlight that although residential photovoltaic systems are considered “clean” and have a relatively low environmental impact throughout their life cycle, depending on the installation location and local electricity mix this might not be the case in the coming years. The energy return on energy invested ranges from 1.64 to almost 5 depending on location, while their simple payback period is less than 11 years in most cases, and as low as 5, without any subsidy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity grids; Life cycle assessment; Photovoltaics; Simple payback; Solar electricity","Artificial life; Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Environmental impact; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Electricity grids; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Photovoltaics; Simple payback; Solar electricity; Life cycle; carbon dioxide; cost analysis; electricity; environmental economics; environmental impact; heating; life cycle analysis; photovoltaic system; solar power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073739651

In response to attack by chewing arthropod herbivores or nectrotrophic pathogens, many plants mount a rapid and intense increase in jasmonate-related phytohormones that results in a robust defense response; however, previous studies have shown that C3 plants grown at elevated CO2 may have lower induced jasmonate levels, particularly in well nitrate-fertilized plants. Given the relationship between atmospheric CO2, photorespiration, cellular reductant and redox status, nitrogen assimilation and phytohormones, we compared wound-induced responses of the C3 plant Arabidopsis thaliana. These plants were fertilized at two different rates (1 or 10 mM) with nitrate or ammonium and grown at ambient or elevated CO2. In response to artificial wounding, an increase in cellular oxidative status leads to a strong increase in jasmonate phytohormones. At ambient CO2, increased oxidative state of nitrate-fertilized plants leads to a robust 7-iso-jasmonyl-L-isoleucine increase; however, the strong fertilizer rate-associated increase is alleviated in plants grown at elevated CO2. As well, the changes in ascorbate in response to wounding and wound-induced salicylic acid levels may also contribute to the suppression of the jasmonate burst. Understanding the mechanism underlying the attenuation of the jasmonate burst at elevated CO2 has important implications for fertilization strategies under future predicted climatic conditions. © Copyright © 2020 Martinez Henao, Demers, Grosser, Schedl, van Dam and Bede.","ascorbate; carbon dioxide; glutathione; jasmonate; nitrogen fertilizer; oxidative stress; pyridine nucleotides; wounding",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078822596

A state government agency, and its forester-actors, enact a policy to plant trees and foster tree stewardship on primarily private property. Community non-profit partners help to promote the program, and individual residents and property owners steward the newly planted trees. In this energy and climate-adaptation formal governance policy, multi-scalar actors are brought together around caring for trees. The resulting relationships and landscape demonstrates the ongoing, emerging and multi-actor making of places as human environments. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Tim Edensor, Ares Kalandides and Uma Kothari.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121186122

Soaring birds are among the most affected groups with alarming fatality rates by collision with wind turbines and an escalating occupation of their migratory corridors. These birds have been described as changing their flight trajectories to avoid wind turbines, but this behaviour may lead to functional habitat loss, as suitable soaring areas in the proximity of wind turbines will likely be underused. We modelled the displacement effect of wind turbines on black kites (Milvus migrans) tracked by GPS. We also evaluated the impact of this effect at the scale of the landscape by estimating how much suitable soaring area was lost to wind turbines. We used state-of-the-art tracking devices to monitor the movements of 130 black kites in an area populated by wind turbines, at the migratory bottleneck of the Strait of Gibraltar. Landscape use by birds was mapped from GPS data using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models, and generalized additive mixed modelling was used to estimate the effect of wind turbine proximity on bird use while accounting for orographic and thermal uplift availability. We found that areas up to approximately 674 m away from the turbines were less used than expected given their uplift potential. Within that distance threshold, bird use decreased with the proximity to wind turbines. We estimated that the footprint of wind turbines affected 3%–14% of the areas suitable for soaring in our study area. We present evidence that the impacts of wind energy industry on soaring birds are greater than previously acknowledged. In addition to the commonly reported fatalities, the avoidance of turbines by soaring birds causes habitat losses in their movement corridors. Authorities should recognize this further impact of wind energy production and establish new regulations that protect soaring habitat. We also showed that soaring habitat for birds can be modelled at a fine scale using publicly available data. Such an approach can be used to plan low-impact placement of turbines in new wind energy developments. © 2019 The Authors.

Particularly in the residential sector, implementation of an energy hub infrastructure increases the resiliency of the local system against grid failures and provides economic and environment benefits with respect to system operation. However, recent transition towards electric mobility in the transportation sector introduces new challenges to the optimization of dispatch of energy vectors within residential energy hubs. This is partly due to the uncontrolled charging behavior exhibited by large plug-in electric vehicle (EV) fleets. Under uncontrolled charging conditions, residential energy hubs are impacted by significant additional energy consumption loads and must adapt appropriately to ensure optimal operation of the overall system. In this chapter, the impact of two levels of uncontrolled EV fleet charging rates are projected onto a residential energy hub under different distributed energy technology configurations. The effects of these various conditions on the optimal operation of the residential energy hub are evaluated using a mixed-integer linear programming approach. Economic and emission analysis of the results of this study indicate the operating cost-cutting potential of lower EV charging rates and co-generation technologies, as well as the corresponding tradeoff in emission generation. Furthermore, the operating cost and emission impacts of cogeneration of heat and power (CHP) implementation under an Ontario context were examined, indicating up to 34% operating cost reduction and a 49% emission increase resulting from CHP adoption. Finally, the limitations in solar photovoltaic adoption in the residential energy hub were discussed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Electric vehicle; Energy hub; Mixed-integer linear programming; Optimization",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085436659

These are discussed in relation to hydrometeorological hazards that trigger natural disasters, such as flash floods, landslides, and droughts, that affect the population and local economies. A review of the most updated literature on rainfall and extremes in the MASP shows a significant increase in the total volume of rainy-season rainfall during the last seven decades. While there were practically no days with heavy rain (more than 50 mm) in the 1950s, these days have been occurring two to five times a year in the last 10 years. This, together with the inappropriate occupation of risky areas, such as slopes and banks of watercourses, leads to inundation, flooding, and landslides. Changes in extremes can be partly due to natural climate variability but can also be related to global warming and/or urbanization. There is ample evidence of an increasing risk of rainfall-related hazards in the MASP. This is particularly so for landslides in vulnerable areas. Exposure will continue to lead to risk increases. This calls for significant improvement in climate and disaster risk reduction and management efforts in the MASP region. © 2020 New York Academy of Sciences.","climate change; climate extremes; disaster risk reduction; metropolitan area; natural disasters; São Paulo","rain; Brazil; climate change; drought; flooding; greenhouse effect; hazard; human; landslide; meteorological phenomena; model; natural disaster; precipitation; rainy season; Review; urban area; urbanization; climate; climate change; disaster; disaster planning; flooding; Brazil; Climate; Climate Change; Disaster Planning; Disasters; Floods; Humans; Rain",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085640110

However, one-third of the world's population uses highly polluting fuels for cooking, heating, or lighting, especially in low- and middle-income countries. Due to the above, the environmental authorities of most of the countries have established different short-, medium-, and long-term regulations to reduce this pollution. It should be noted that it is challenging to identify the real effectiveness of this type of regulation since it is necessary to determine whether the pollution was reduced exclusively by the implementation of that regulation or due to other confusing factors. To address this issue, the present study performs an ex - post evaluation of the Critical Episodes Management program that imposes restrictions on the use of firewood heaters during pre-emergency and emergency episodes to reduce air pollution in the short-term in the city of Temuco, Chile (one of the most polluted cities in Latin America). Specifically, a fixed-effects panel data regression is applied to hourly concentrations of particulate matter data, controlling by meteorological and seasonal factors. The results show that restrictions on the use of firewood heaters generate a significant reduction in PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations during pre-emergency episodes (9.2% and 17.5%) and emergency episodes (5.9% and 16.3%). Thus, it can be concluded that this program is useful, but it must be complemented by others medium- and long-term environmental programs. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Ex – post evaluation; Fixed effects; Panel data; Particulate matter","Air pollution; Environmental regulations; Pollution control; Environmental Authority; Environmental programs; Ex-post evaluations; Fixed effects; Low and middle income countries; Panel data; Particulate Matter; Post evaluations; Particles (particulate matter); atmospheric pollution; health impact; panel data; particulate matter; pollution effect; regulatory approach; Araucania; Chile; Latin America; Temuco",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074570964

Most of the energy consumed is still based on fossil fuels, which is considered the most important cause of the rise in greenhouse gases and thus the deepening climate crisis. Therefore, the transformation of urban areas into energy-efficient and low-carbon cities has become a necessity to create a sustainable future. The climate data-based evaluation of the relationship between buildings, which have the largest energy-saving potential, and urban geometry, which affects the energy performance of buildings in the long term, is crucially important. This study aims to evaluate the potential impacts of climate change on the energy performance of buildings at the settlement scale. For this purpose, changes in building energy performance within different settlement pattern alternatives created for Istanbul (a temperate-humid climate), where new settlement patterns are rapidly developed, were evaluated according to present and future weather files. The evaluation results have demonstrated that sustainable energy use in urban areas is only possible through the integration of a building’s energy performance, urban geometry and climate change in the planning and design stages. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

It has been proposed that this encroachment is driven in part by rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and reduced salinity in saltmarshes resulting from rising sea levels enhancing the establishment success of mangrove seedlings. However, this theory is yet to be empirically tested at the community-level. In this study, we examined the effect of CO2 and salinity on seedling growth of two mangrove species, Aegiceras corniculatum and Avicennia marina, grown individually and in a model saltmarsh community in a glasshouse experiment. We found that the shoot (210%) and root (91%) biomass of the saltmarsh species was significantly greater under elevated CO2. As a result, both mangrove species experienced a stronger competitive effect from the saltmarsh species under elevated CO2. Nevertheless, A. marina seedlings produced on average 48% more biomass under elevated CO2 when grown in competition with the saltmarsh species. The seedlings tended to allocate this additional biomass to growing taller suggesting they were light limited. In contrast, A. corniculatum growth did not significantly differ between CO2 treatments. However, it had on average 36% greater growth under seawater salinity compared to hypersaline conditions. Avicennia marina seedlings were not affected by salinity. From these results, we suggest that although CO2 and salinity are not universal drivers determining saltmarsh–mangrove boundaries, it is likely that rising atmospheric CO2 concentration and reduced salinity associated with sea level rise will enhance the establishment success of mangrove seedlings in saltmarshes, which may facilitate mangrove encroachment in the future. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Aegiceras corniculatum; Avicennia marina; Climate change; Wetland; Woody plant encroachment","carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; hypersaline environment; mangrove; saltmarsh; seawater; seedling; seedling establishment; shoot growth; wetland; woody plant; Aegiceras corniculatum; Avicennia marina; carbon dioxide; Avicennia; biomass; salinity; seedling; Avicennia; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Salinity; Seedlings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075557927

Currently, the GDP of the country shows a growth trend of 7 percent and above annually. Better macroeconomic management, the transition to a democratic system; important contributions from the garments, textile, and agriculture sectors; high levels of foreign remittances; and so on have led to continued economic growth and a higher per capita income. Over the near term, growth is expected to remain resilient, underpinned by strong domestic demand. The country is moving toward middle-income status by 2024. The Bangladesh Vision 2021 and the Perspective Plan of Bangladesh provide a road map for accelerated growth in the eradication of poverty as well as in addressing inequity and human deprivation. It is accepted that the country will need inclusive economic growth with distributive justice and equity for a sustained and resilient society. However, its economic growth and development potential are constrained by the growing impact of global climate change, which is undermining the development process and its outcomes. Effective implementation of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) may lead the country toward inclusive social development, but Bangladesh needs a strategy and action plan to protect economic growth and make the development process and outcome resilient to rapid climate change and other externalities. The country should pursue green growth and a climate-resilient development path so that the people, enterprise, environment, and ecosystems are not affected very much by climate change and the development outcomes are equitable and sustainable. This will require further investment, massive employment, better management, adaptation and mitigation to climate change, bottom-up planning, localization of SDGs, and good governance. © The Author(s) 2020.","Adaptation to climate change; Climate-resilient development; Economic growth; Inclusive social development; Poverty alleviation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088467979

While the GWP is simple and versatile, different views about the appropriate choice of time horizon—and the factors that affect that choice—can impede decision-making. If the GWP is viewed as an approximation to a climate metric that more directly measures economic impact—the global damage potential (GDP)—then the time horizon may be viewed as a proxy for the discount rate. However, the validity of this equivalence rests on the theoretical basis used to equate the two metrics. In this paper, we develop a new theoretical basis for relating the GWP time horizon and the economic discount rate that avoids the most restrictive assumptions of prior studies, such as an assumed linear relationship between economic damages and temperature. We validate this approach with an extensive set of numerical experiments using an up-to-date climate emulator that represents state-dependent climate-carbon cycle feedbacks. The numerical results largely confirm the theoretical finding that, under certain reasonable assumptions, time horizons in the GWP of 100 years and 20 years are most consistent with discount rates of approximately 3% and 7% (or greater), respectively. © 2019, ExxonMobil Research and Engineering Company.",,"Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Gas emissions; Global warming; Life cycle; Economic climates; Economic impacts; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Linear relationships; Numerical experiments; Numerical results; Technology life cycle; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073978705

Two fundamentally different mechanisms can be envisaged for this system: (i) an inner-sphere mechanism starting with substitution of the acetonitrile ligand of 1-RhH by an aldehyde and (ii) an outer-sphere mechanism starting with direct insertion of an aldehyde into a Rh-H bond of the intact 1-RhH to make an octahedral Rh-alkoxide intermediate. We use DFT methods to investigate the two mechanisms. The inner-sphere mechanism is computed to be energetically favorable. The outer-sphere one, in contrast, is prohibitively high in energy. This is opposite to catalysis of the same reaction using Gusev's pincer-ligated octahedral catalyst trans-[(PHNN)Os(H)2(CO)] (2-OsH) where the outer-sphere mechanism was previously reported to have very low energy. The different behaviors of 1-RhH and 2-OsH can be attributed to a role from the different metals in the two catalysts as well as a role from their different ligands. Specifically, the higher oxidation state of the metal in 1-RhH, Rh(III) versus Os(II), greatly diminishes its thermodynamic hydricity leading to separated ions compared to 2-OsH, whereas the amino functionality of the ligand in 2-OsH greatly favors the kinetic hydricity in the reaction with an aldehyde by hydrogen bonding with the carbonyl group being reduced. Comparisons are also made with Milstein's trans-[PNN-Ru(H)2(CO)] alcohol dehydrogenative coupling catalyst (3-RuH) which also lacks the amino functionality.

The negative effects of such practices relate, but are not limited, to the increasing duration and intensity of thermal discomfort in the public and semi-public realm. Considering the significance of improved microclimate, this research focuses on the summer thermal comfort conditions of three shopping arcades. The study is undertaken in the context of a research on semi-open spaces as a means of excessive discomfort moderation. The adjoining streets, were examined to compare the thermal performance of arcades with other urban typologies. The research is carried out in the historic centre of Nicosia which experiences an intense Mediterranean climate. On-site environmental monitoring has allowed a detailed thermal comfort analysis, using the PET thermal index scale which is applicable to warm climates. Compared to open streets, shopping arcades were found able to mitigate extreme thermal comfort conditions, although they remained above acceptable thermal comfort limits for most of the monitoring time. Arcades are associated with less intense heat stress levels which give evidence to their thermal advantages over completely exposed open streets and highlight their bioclimatic potential in the Mediterranean climate. Arcades may thus be re-considered and re-introduced as beneficial microclimate control elements in sustainable urban planning agendas. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Arches; Shopping centers; Sustainable development; Thermal comfort; Urban planning; Comfort conditions; Mediterranean climates; Microclimate control; On site environmental monitoring; Planning policies; Thermal advantages; Thermal comfort analysis; Thermal Performance; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079610474

Recent laboratory and semi-field assessments of pesticide impacts on bees have focused on neonicotinoid insecticides. However, field studies evaluating influences of neonicotinoid seed treatments on native bee communities of North America are absent from the literature. On four Conservation Areas of Missouri, we sampled row-cropped (treated, n = 15) and reference (untreated, n = 9) agricultural fields, and their surrounding field margins for neonicotinoids in soil and non-target vegetation (i.e., native wildflowers). Wildflowers were further collected and screened for the presence of fungicides. Concurrently, we sampled native bees over three discrete time points throughout the agricultural growing season to assess potential impacts of seed treatment use on local bee populations over time. Neonicotinoids were detected in 87% to 100% of treated field soils and 22% to 56% of reference field soils. In adjacent field margin soils, quantifiable concentrations were measured near treated (53% to 93% detection) and untreated fields (33% to 56% detection). Fungicides were detected in < 40% of wildflowers, whereas neonicotinoids were rarely detected in field margin vegetation (< 7%). Neonicotinoid concentrations in margin soils were negatively associated with native bee richness (β = −0.21, P < 0.05). Field margins with a combination of greater neonicotinoid concentrations in soil and fungicides in wildflowers also contained fewer wild bee species (β = −0.21, P < 0.001). By comparison, bee abundance was positively influenced by the number of wildflower species in bloom with no apparent impact of pesticides. Results of this study indicate that neonicotinoids in soil are a potential route of exposure for pollinator communities, specifically ground-nesting species. Importantly, native bee richness in non-target field margins may be negatively affected by the use of neonicotinoid seed treatments in agroecosystems. © 2019","Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Field margin; Pesticide impacts; Pollinators","abundance; agricultural ecosystem; bee; biodiversity; concentration (composition); ecosystem service; field margin; fungicide; growing season; habitat loss; neonicotinoid pesticide; pollinator; seed treatment; species richness; wild population; Missouri; North America; United States; Apoidea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073119095

Using a seedling common garden trial of 281 lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) populations from across western Canada, we compare genomic data to phenotypic and climatic data to assess their effectiveness in characterizing the climatic drivers and spatial scale of local adaptation in this species. We find that phenotype-associated loci are equivalent or slightly superior to climate data for describing local adaptation in seedling traits, but that climate data are superior to genomic data that have not been selected for phenotypic associations. We also find agreement between the climate variables associated with genomic variation and with 20-year heights from a long-term provenance trial, suggesting that genomic data may be a viable option for identifying climatic drivers of local adaptation where phenotypic data are unavailable. Genetic clines associated with the experimental traits occur at broad spatial scales, suggesting that standing variation of adaptive alleles for this and similar species does not require management at scales finer than those indicated by phenotypic data.

Plant interactions with microbial mutualists could also be functional traits because they influence how plants respond to environmental variation, but tests of this hypothesis are rare. I explored whether variation in the plant mutualism with arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi is associated with climatic tolerances, geographic range size, and fitness components (survival, reproduction, individual growth) that influence population growth. Analyses were done with categorical and quantitative metrics of mutualism variation to determine whether outcomes were consistent. Plants that are always colonized by AM fungi (AM state) occurred in warmer climates than either plants that are never colonized by AM fungi (NM state) or plants that vary in whether they are colonized (AMNM state), whereas AMNM plants had larger geographic ranges than either AM or NM plants. The effect of variation in individual growth rate on population growth rate was significantly higher in AMNM and NM plants than in AM plants, whereas the effect that variation in survival and reproduction had on population growth rate did not differ among mycorrhizal states. Quantitative variation in the mutualism, expressed as mycorrhizal growth response (MGR; biomass ratio of AM fungal–inoculated plants to noninoculated controls) rarely predicted climate tolerances and geographic range size. These findings suggest that mycorrhizal state is a functional trait based on traditional definitions but that MGR may not necessarily reflect functionally meaningful variation in the mutualism, at least not beyond the context of the conditions in which it was measured. Nonetheless, these findings provide the first evidence linking variation in mycorrhizal mutualism to the fitness components that influence population growth, implying that variation in plant interactions with mycorrhizal fungi has consequences for plant population dynamics. © 2019 by The University of Chicago.

In this configuration, the process performance in both temperatures were estimated and the microbial communities were characterized by full-length16S rRNA genes and/or microbial activities. In addition, the appropriate solubilization reaction time was assessed. The results revealed that the higher hydrolysis and acidogenesis activities were achieved with longer reaction time of pretreatment (5 days) and thus higher organic nitrogen conversion and alkalinity were attained. Under appropriate pretreatment reaction time, pretreated sludge was characterized by 65% higher organic matters solubilization and 1.4-fold higher volatile fatty acids (VFAs) concentration compared to raw sludge. The overall methane yield produced under this scenario was 179 L CH4. KgVSin, with 15% of the absolute yield was produced in hydrolysis reactor. 50% reduction in bacteria belong to Firmicurtes was observed at mesophilic reactor and meanwhile the relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Cloacimonetes were enhanced.

Meeting the needs of the increasing number of people on the planet presents a challenge for reducing total GHG burden. A further challenge may be the size of the average person on the planet and the increasing number of people with excess body weight. We used data on GHG emissions from various sources and estimated that obesity is associated with ~20% greater GHG emissions compared with the normal-weight state. On a global scale, obesity contributes to an extra GHG emissions of ~49 megatons per year of CO2 equivalent (CO2eq) from oxidative metabolism due to greater metabolic demands, ~361 megatons per year of CO2eq from food production processes due to increased food intake, and ~290 megatons per year of CO2eq from automobile and air transportation due to greater body weight. Therefore, the total impact of obesity may be extra emissions of ~700 megatons per year of CO2eq, which is about 1.6% of worldwide GHG emissions. Inasmuch as obesity is an important contributor to global GHG burden, strategies to reduce its prevalence should prioritize efforts to reduce GHG emissions. Accordingly, reducing obesity may have considerable benefits for both public health and the environment. © 2019 The Obesity Society",,"aerobic metabolism; body weight; carbon footprint; climate change; disease burden; environmental factor; food intake; human; human activities; obesity; prevalence; Review; traffic and transport; adverse event; demography; environmental exposure; environmental planning; exhaust gas; greenhouse gas; metabolism; obesity; oxidative stress; particulate matter; physiology; risk factor; social environment; toxicity; xenobiotic metabolism; carbon dioxide; Carbon Dioxide; Environment Design; Environmental Exposure; Greenhouse Gases; Humans; Metabolic Detoxication, Phase I; Obesity; Oxidative Stress; Particulate Matter; Residence Characteristics; Risk Factors; Social Environment; Vehicle Emissions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076903001

Reduction in air pollution is associated with improvements in mortality and rates of respiratory, cardiovascular and other diseases. Though air quality is a problem globally, efforts to lower air pollutant concentrations are usually regional or local. In industrialized countries, most urban air pollution is caused by vehicles, suggesting reductions in traffic would result in reductions of pollution. However, detailed data on how such reductions can be achieved and impact public health is just beginning to emerge, and other influencing factors, including vehicle flow or urban landscape are largely unaccounted for. Methods: We utilized a unique combination of vehicle emission measurements combined with simulations of traffic and vehicle variations, as well as urban topographies, to quantify health impacts of PM10 reduction in a single district of Paris, France, for various methods of traffic improvement. Here we rank and evaluate improvements in non-accidental mortality for thirteen possible scenarios to reduce traffic related PM10 emissions. Results: The maximum impact scenario requires all passenger vehicles to meet Euro 5 standards and excludes diesel vehicles, resulting in long-term decreases in non-accidental mortality of 148.79 people per year, or 104.40 per 100,000 people. Similar reductions hold for the scenario requiring a completely electric passenger fleet, with long-term annual reductions of 137.14 premature mortalities. Removing all diesel vehicles is the third most impactful scenario, preventing 135.55 deaths yearly. Discussion: PARTLESS provides comparisons between thirteen different traffic-related air quality reduction mechanisms in terms of improvements in mortality rates. Improving emissions standards, increasing electric vehicle use and removing diesel vehicles can prevent more than 148 deaths per year in this district alone. Further improvements in mortality reduction may require changes to the composition of vehicle components, asphalt or to the management of resuspended particulate matter. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Health impact analysis; Mortality; Particulate matter; Urban air pollution","Accidents; Diesel engines; Diesel locomotives; Health; Particles (particulate matter); Population statistics; Vehicles; Air pollutant concentrations; Health impact; Industrialized countries; Mortality; Particulate Matter; Premature mortality; Urban air pollution; Vehicle components; Air quality; asphalt; fuel; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); health impact; mortality; particulate matter; pollution exposure; traffic emission; urban area; air pollution control; Article; concentration (parameter); diesel engine; exhaust gas; France; health hazard; health impact assessment; human; human impact (environment); mortality; particulate matter; priority journal; proof of concept; public health; simulation; traffic pollution; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; mortality; particulate matter; France; Ile de France; Paris; Ville de Paris; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Mortality; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071730205

Suspicion of brain death while on ECMO creates a conundrum. The American Academy of Neurology states that apnea testing is a critical component of the process to declare brain death. However, there is a paucity of literature on apnea testing for confirmation of brain death in patients on venoarterial ECMO and venovenous ECMO. Traditional apnea testing does not consider ECMO physiology or de-recruitment of the lungs in this subset of critically ill patients. Complications with traditional apnea testing include hemodynamic instability that may lead to cardiac arrest and death. METHODS: We conducted a retrospective review of apnea tests using the carbogen method performed for brain death determination on 5 subjects on ECMO. A positive apnea test was used in confirmation of brain death in all 5 subjects on either venovenous ECMO (n = 2) or venoarterial ECMO (n = 3) while remaining on mechanical ventilation. A formula was used to calculate the subject’s target value for CO2 production and completion of the apnea test. RESULTS: In all 5 cases, the carbogen method resulted in 100% accuracy of the targeted CO2 goal, and apnea testing was confirmed with no adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In 5 subjects on ECMO, the carbogen method for apnea testing as part of the process to declare brain death was accurate in predicting the end point of the apnea test. With the increased use of ECMO in adults and the ongoing need for organs, methods to confirm brain death with apnea testing while on ECMO should be further studied. © 2020 Daedalus Enterprises.","Apnea tests; Brain death; ECMO; Mechanical ventilation","carbogen; carbogen; carbon dioxide; oxygen; adult; apnea; apnea test; arterial gas; Article; artificial ventilation; blood carbon dioxide tension; brain death; case report; clinical article; critically ill patient; diabetic ketoacidosis; diagnostic procedure; extracorporeal oxygenation; female; heart arrest; hemodynamics; human; intensive care unit; lung embolism; male; neuroimaging; risk factor; Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score; systolic blood pressure; traumatic brain injury; young adult; apnea; brain death; critical illness; retrospective study; Adult; Apnea; Brain Death; Carbon Dioxide; Critical Illness; Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation; Humans; Oxygen; Respiration, Artificial; Retrospective Studies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077296043

To reduce the effects of severe pollution, early warning and emission reduction measures should be executed prior to these haze episodes. In this study, the efficacy of emission reduction procedures during severe pollution episodes was evaluated using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem). To provide feedback and optimize emergency emission reduction plans, a pollution episode that occurred during the period of December 20–26, 2015, which was characterized by a high warning level, long warning period, and integrated pollution process, was selected as a case study to determine the influence of meteorological conditions and the effects of mitigation measures on heavy haze pollution episodes. Adverse meteorological conditions were found to increase PM2.5 concentrations by approximately 34% during the pollution episode. Moreover, the largest contributor to the episode was fossil fuel combustion, followed by dust emission and industrial processes; the first two factors play a significant role in most districts in Tianjin, whereas the third more strongly affects the adjoining districts and Binhai District. Emission reduction for industrial sources and domestic combustion more obviously decreases PM2.5 concentrations during the pollution dissipation stage than the pollution accumulation stage.

The sewage was purified with higher removal efficiency of COD (90 ± 3%), TN (93 ± 3%) and TP (99 ± 0%) in the unsterilized condition with 10% CO2 supplementation than that with 0.038% CO2 (air) supplementation (COD: 65 ± 2%; TN: 81 ± 1%; TP: 95 ± 0%). The coexistence of bacteria and microalgae in unsterilized sewage had a significant effect on COD removal, while microalgae played a dominant role in nutrients (N and P) removal. Quality of effluent water complied with the class I-A criteria specified in Chinese Discharge Standard of Pollutants for Municipal Wastewater Treatment Plant. Supplementation with 10% CO2 promoted the recovery of nitrogen (84 ± 10%) and phosphorus (90 ± 9%) from sewage compared to that of 0.038% CO2 (air) supplementation (N: 58 ± 3%, P: 59 ± 4%), which is due to the improved carbon supply and more favorable pH of 6.8–7.8 adjusted by high CO2 concentration. In addition, the CO2 fixation rate reached up to 551 ± 1 mg L− 1 d− 1 by Tetradesmus obliquus PF3 and the carbohydrate content in the obtained biomass was as high as 60 ± 2%.

The dynamic vehicle restriction policies include One-Day-Per-Week (ODPW) and Odd-And-Even (OAE). The implementation of these policies can cause private car users to switch to public transport. This adds tremendous pressure on urban public transportation systems, especially the rail transport network (RTN). In this study, we examine the impact of dynamic restriction policies on RTN's vulnerability. An evaluation indicator system for RTN's vulnerability is first constructed using the average shortest path, congestion degree, and average passenger flow intensity. Thereafter, we simulate the cascading failure process of the RTN using a load capacity model. The simulation results show that implementing dynamic vehicle restriction policies will lead to cascading failure of the RTN and increase its vulnerability. According to the simulation results, it was found that when the restriction policy changes from ODPW to OAE, the RTN is more likely to cause cascading failure and its vulnerability increases sharply. Consequently, transport operators should adopt various measures to prevent the cascading failures of RTN and reduce its vulnerability according to different restriction policies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Complex network; Dynamic vehicle restriction; Rail transit network; Vulnerability","Complex networks; Light rail transit; Network security; Transportation routes; Vehicles; Cascading failures; Evaluation indicator system; Rail transit; Restriction policy; Transport operators; Urban public transportation systems; Urban rail transit; Vulnerability; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072715921

Mobility and transport have the highest potential to reduce emissions of carbon in urban areas. Local and international companies have been affected by introducing Chinese apps and smart communication networks. A vast potential can be seen in turning urban mobility into long-term sustainability by incorporating pre-existing but under-utilized low-carbon carriers in cities like public transport into various shared business networks. Though, exponential market growth and creativity in the sharing economy have undermined existing knowledge sources, socio-economic relations, and physical and spatial urban infrastructures. This paper explores the connection between the ongoing development of urban systems and socio-ecological developments in mobility sharing, using observational data from three case studies focusing on automobile sharing in Shanghai. There is a robust evolutionary structure that incorporates an increasingly sustainable urban at macro-level and advanced industry systems into a smart and green transport framework at meso-level. These two layers of evolutionary expansion in urban environments and market systems, created by disruptive mobility-sharing innovations and brought on by urban changes towards an increase in sustainability, both shape one another and strengthen sustainable principles and practices in the swift-changing urban and business innovation industries in Shanghai. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The results showed that the grain-filling duration of maize would be shortened 6–15 days in the future as a result of climate change. Thus, potential maize yield would decrease by 2–32%, and rainfed maize yield would decrease by 0–24% during 2010–2099 relative to 1976–2005. In response to climate change, adaptive measures should be taken to overcome its projected impact. The adoption of new cultivars while maintaining the same pre-flowering and post-flowering duration in the future as in the present would help to improve potential maize yield by 50–61% in three time slices (2030s, 2050s, and 2070s) and would be a better choice for high yields in the future. The cultivars that would maintain the same post-flowering duration in the future as in the present would be a better choice than the cultivars that would maintain the pre-flowing periods for summer maize in China. Adjusting sowing dates would be another important way to extend post-flowering periods and further improve maize yield. If the maize cultivar currently used was adopted, delaying the sowing date would improve the potential maize yield by 2–25%. If future maize cultivars that maintained the growing period even as warmer temperatures accelerate phenological development were adopted, delaying the sowing date would improve the potential maize yield by 0–8.9%. The interactive effect of sowing and cultivars was quantified. Based on the findings of this study, future maize cultivars maintaining the growing period were adopted, and delaying the sowing date could still improve potential maize yield worldwide. Two regional adaptation strategies to climate change could offset the potential reduction of maize production worldwide, which would provide farmers and policy-makers with explicit guidance. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaption; Climate change; Maize; Yield","adaptation; adaptive management; climate change; crop production; crop yield; cultivar; flowering; maize; phenology; sowing date; strategic approach; temperature effect; China; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064672406

Furthermore, the Al droplet on graphite surface has a better wettability than that on amorphous carbon surface. Similarly, the contact angle will also reduce with the increased degree of graphitization and the wetting state will change from the transition wetting state to the Cassie state when the roughness increases. In addition to the contact angles on the rough surface, the remaining contact angles are less than 90°, which is different from the previous reports. The free energy and thermodynamic properties analysis were applied to character the solid-liquid interface properties and explain the wettability.

Traditional techniques can meet the requirement of routine food analysis in laboratory. However, serious food safety situations urgently demand rapid, time-saving, low-cost analysis methods even on-site, portable and household testing kits. Fluorescence analysis exhibits immense potential for food safety owing to its remarkable advantages of high sensitivity, ease of operation, low cost and rapid result outputs. Scope and approach: Carbon dots (CDs) are novel 0D carbonic nanomaterials recently emerging as potential substitutes for traditional fluorescent materials. Compared with the conventional fluorescent materials, e.g. organic fluorescent dyes, metal nanoparticles/nanoclusters and quantum dots (QDs), CDs possess many appealing merits such as ease of preparation, low cost, non-blinking, low cytotoxicity, excellent biocompatibility and high resistance to photo-bleaching. As a result CDs-based fluorescence sensing provides excellent analysis platforms for monitoring food-related analytes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the state-of-the-art synthesis methods and the fluorescence properties of CDs along with the sensing mechanisms and designing principles of CDs-based fluorescent sensors for food analysis. Possible challenges and appealing prospects of CDs-based fluorescent sensors are also discussed. Key findings and conclusions: CDs have been widely applied in bio-imaging, sensing, drug delivery, catalysis and optronics. Integration of CDs into food science and engineering for food safety control and risk assessment exhibits a bright future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon nanomaterials; Fluorescence assay; Food analysis; Food safety; Nanosensors; Optical sensors","Biocompatibility; Carbon; Controlled drug delivery; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Fluorescence; Health risks; Metal nanoparticles; Nanosensors; Nanostructured materials; Optical sensors; Quality control; Risk assessment; Safety engineering; Safety testing; Semiconductor quantum dots; Carbon nano-materials; Fluorescence analysis; Fluorescence assay; Fluorescence properties; Food analysis; Food quality and safeties; Organic fluorescent dyes; Traditional techniques; Food safety",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075529871

Results showed that: (1) increasing plant species richness reduced the human and ecosystem health damage costs of the three gases; (2) the systems with Arundo donax had lower greenhouse gas emissions and ecosystem health damage costs, while the systems with Lythrum salicaria had lower ammonia emissions and human health damage costs than systems without the species; (3) the structural equation model indicated that the plant combinations with high biomass or high nitrate removal ability contributed to reducing health damage costs. This study suggests that manipulating high plant species richness and proper species is a clean approach in floating constructed wetlands for high ammonium wastewater treatment with low environmental costs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Nitrogen removal; Species identity; Species richness; Structural equation model; Wastewater treatment","Air pollution control; Ammonia; Cost reduction; Ecosystems; Greenhouse gases; Health; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Wetlands; Constructed wetlands; Environmental costs; Human health damages; Plant species richness; Species identity; Species richness; Structural equation modeling; Treatment technologies; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074359438

The radionuclide concentrations were analyzed by gamma spectrometry. The median values of the activity concentrations of 226Ra (20), 228Ra (38) and 40K (458) (Bq kg−1) in the soils agreed with the values reported worldwide. The concentrations of 40K in the soils from the semiarid region were higher than those in the soils from the tropical region, whereas the radium isotope levels were higher in soils from the tropical region. The less-developed soils from the semiarid region, such as Leptosols and Neosols, had the highest 40K levels, unlike the more developed soils (Acrisols and Ferrosols) from the tropical wet area, which showed the lowest contents of 40K and the highest content of radium isotopes. The low 40K contents in well-developed soils may be attributed to the leaching of 40K by the high rainfall rates of the tropical area. In contrast, the rainfall scarcity and high potential evaporation rates of the semiarid environment may be responsible for 40K accumulation in soils. The highest Ra isotope concentrations in the well-drained soils from the tropical climate may be ascribed to the presence of heavy minerals and adsorption on Fe oxyhydroxides, which are very common in those soils. The more developed the soil the lower the K concentration, regardless of the climate. For Ra, the differences are more significant for well-drained soils, and in this case, the tropical climate, with its high rainfall rate, makes the difference. As a conclusion, climate and soil formation time showed high and contrasting influence on the 40K and radium isotope contents in soils. Less developed soils from semiarid had the highest content of 40K, whereas the more developed soils from tropical areas had the highest content of radium. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Natural radionuclides; Semiarid climate; Soil type; Surface soil; Tropical climate","Arid regions; Climatology; Iron compounds; Minerals; Radioisotopes; Radium; Rain; Soils; Tropical engineering; Tropics; Natural radionuclides; Semi-arid climate; Soil types; Surface soil; Tropical climates; Soil pollution; ferric hydroxide; potassium 40; radioisotope; radium 226; radium 228; rain; radioisotope; concentration (composition); radionuclide; radium isotope; rainfall; semiarid region; soil classification; soil type; spatial distribution; tropical environment; adsorption; Article; concentration (parameter); evaporation; gamma spectrometry; granite; ionizing radiation; leaching; natural radioactivity; pedogenesis (soil); Pernambuco; rock; seashore; semiarid climate; soil quality; surface soil; tropic climate; tropics; weathering; Brazil; climate; radiation monitoring; soil; soil pollutant; Brazil; Pernambuco; Brazil; Climate; Radiation Monitoring; Radioisotopes; Soil; Soil Pollutants, Radioactive",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072699613

Together they define a global safe operating space for human development. Translating the global limits to the national level increases their policy relevance. Such translation essentially divides up the global safe operating space. What is considered fair distribution is a political decision and there is no globally agreed principle that can be applied. Here, we analyse the distributional consequences of alternative perspectives on distributive fairness. We scale the global limits of selected PBs to resource budgets for the EU, US, China and India, using three allocation approaches from the climate change literature. Furthermore, we compare the allocated budgets to 2010 environmental footprints of the four economies, to assess their performance with respect to the selected PBs. The allocation approaches are based on (1) current shares of global environmental pressure (‘grandfathering’); (2) ‘equal per capita’ shares, and (3) ‘ability to pay’ to reduce environmental pressure. The results show that the four economies are not living within the global safe operating space. Their 2010 environmental footprints are larger than the allocated budgets for all approaches and parameterisations analysed for the PBs for climate change and biogeochemical flows, and, except for India, also for the PB for biosphere integrity. Grandfathering was found to be most favourable for the EU and US for all PBs, and ability to pay as least favourable. For climate change and biogeochemical flows, ability to pay even resulted in negative resource budgets for the two economies. In contrast, for China and India, equal per capita allocation and ability to pay were most favourable. Results were sensitive to the parameterisation. Accounting for future population growth in the equal per capita approach benefits India, with lower budgets for the EU, US and China, while accounting for future economic growth in ability to pay benefits the EU and US, with lower budgets for China and India. Our results underline the need for all four economies to act, while hinting at diverging preferences for specific allocation approaches. The methodology and results may help countries to define policy targets in line with global ambitions, such as those defined by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), accounting for differences in countries’ circumstances and capacities. Further attention is required for PB-specific allocation approaches and integration of biophysical and socioeconomic considerations in the allocation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Budget allocation; Environmental footprints; Equity; MRIO modelling; Planetary boundaries","allocative efficiency; biogeochemistry; climate change; ecological footprint; economic growth; environmental economics; equity; planetary atmosphere; socioeconomic conditions; sustainable development; China; India; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076110769

The relationship between the growth of PM2.5 and the changes of land use in China during 1998-2015 was explored in this paper using the Theil-Sen median trend analysis, Mann-Kendall and spatial econometric model. The results showed that the area where PM2.5 concentration was less than 10 μg/m3 accounted for a small portion (18.33%) of the land area in China, and the area where PM2.5 concentration was more than 35 μg/m3 accounted for 31.30% of the land area. High PM2.5 concentration was found in the East China Plain and Taklimakan desert; artificial surfaces, cultivated land and deserts were coated with high PM2.5 concentration more frequently, while the forest, grassland and unused land were usually covered with low PM2.5 concentration. PM2.5 concentration in desert land and artificial surfaces respectively increased at a pace of 1.07 μg/m3 and 0.80 μg/m3 per year during 1998–2015, higher than those in other land use types. They mainly came from the sand dust aerosol in northwest China, while those in the other areas mainly came from emissions in the human activities. Therefore, reasonable coordinating the proportion of construction land, cultivated land, forest land and grassland in eastern China, and strengthening desert governance in northwest China, are suggested to reduce PM2.5 concentration in China. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Land use; Particulate matter (PM2.5); Spatial econometric model","Arid regions; Forestry; Landforms; Pollution control; Artificial surfaces; Construction land; Emission sources; Human activities; Particulate Matter; PM2.5 concentration; Spatial econometric models; Taklimakan desert; Land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073146205

Surviving Democracy probes the way democracy became neoliberalized and the role neoliberalized democracy plays in our dealings with-causing, understanding, denying, and mitigating-climate change. Defining neoliberalism as the art of exclusion through inclusion, Chien-Yi Lu treats climate change as collateral damage of the neoliberal order established to ensure upward power and wealth redistribution. Highlighting the role money played in the “free” competition of ideas between Keynes and Hayek, she investigates the resulting global structure, wherein the wealthy and powerful sit above the market and democracy, and the way this structure fundamentally contradicts with honest climate mitigation. Central to the structure is neoliberal elites’ leveraging of the fluid relationship between the market and the state. Merging citizen power with consumer and investor powers is therefore imperative to the success of climate action. While expediting the bursting of the carbon bubble is an obvious answer, it is the discussion of the meat bubble that brings the book full circle, linking our survival to neoliberalism, inclusion, and democracy.

The ability of a substantial reduction of the primary harmful emissions (HC, CO, and NOx) through the use of the simple three-way catalyst (TWC) is the main reason for that. Nonetheless, with increasing attention to CO2 emissions, the development of highly efficient downsized SI engines turn to be of enormous interest. The synergies of multiple systems such as direct injection, turbocharger, and variable valve actuation are able to lead the SI efficiencies closer to those of CI engines. However, to enable high load operation on such downsized engines, the compression ratio (CR) must be reduced due to knock limitations, reducing the partial-load operations efficiency. The implementation of two-stage variable compression ratio (VCR) systems enables the extraction of high thermal efficiency with high CR at lower loads and extended knock-free high load operation with low CR. In this study, the evaluation of a two-stage VCR system applied to a state-of-the-art downsized SI engine was made through standard driving cycle simulations. The VCR mechanism is composed of an eccentric element in the small end of the connecting rod, which is rotated to increase/decrease the effective connecting rod length, achieving the CRs of 12.11:1 and 9.56:1. The engine was run in an eddy-current dynamometer test bench throughout the essential operating range to obtain the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) map. The VCR mechanism CR switching delay was also experimentally characterized to derive a function of the operating conditions. The measured map was entered into the map-based driving cycle simulation with a sub-model to account for the isolated effects of the transient period encompassing the compression ratio switching. The results show that slow CR transitions lead to fuel consumption penalties, which suggests the need for optimizing the control strategies of the VCR system. Even though this penalty, once the gear up-shift speed is optimized for each driving cycle, the VCR system still enables fuel consumption reductions up to 3% on the WLTC driving cycle, up to 4% on the proposed urban driving cycles and up to 3% on highway driving cycles with respect to the fixed CR. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Downsized internal combustion engines; Driving cycles; Fuel consumption; Variable compression ratio","Automobile engines; Combustion knock; Competition; Connecting rods; Direct injection; Eddy current testing; Efficiency; Fuel consumption; Fuels; Ignition; Brake specific fuel consumption; Compression-ignition engines; Driving cycle; Eddy current dynamometer; Fuel consumption reduction; Substantial reduction; Variable compression ratio; Variable valve actuation; Compression ratio (machinery)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075344823

This behavior was hypothesized as the effect of the population and location of Bi(III) on the Lewis acidity and Lewis basicity of proximal hydroxide and coordinately unsaturated metal surface sites in BizIn2-zO3-x(OH)y acting synergistically as a frustrated Lewis acid-base pair reaction. Nonetheless, such photocatalytic activity is usually optimized in a specific batch reactor setup sequence, with H2 as an initial gas input under photo and thermal conditions before introducing CO2. Hence, the chemical interplay between environment parameters such as photoillumination, thermal input, and gas reactant components with the effects of Bi substitution is unclear. Reported herein, glovebox-protected X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) interrogates this photochemical RWGS reaction transiting from vacuum state to similar conditions in a photocatalytic reactor, under dark and ambient temperatures, 150°C in dark and 150 °C under photoillumination. Binding energy shifts were used to correlate the material system's Lewis basicity response to these acidic probe gases. In-situ gas electronic sensitivity and in-situ UV-vis-derived band-gap trends confirm the trends shown in the XPS results, hence showing its equivalency with in situ methods. The enhanced photocatalytic reduction rate of CO2 with H2 with a low doped 0.05% a.t Bi system is thus associated with an increased gas sensitivity in H2 + CO2, a greater expansion in the OH shoulder than that of the undoped system under heat and light conditions, as well as a greater thermal stability of dissociated H adatoms. The photoinduced expansion of the OH shoulder and the increased positive binding energy shifts show the important role of photoillumination over that of thermal conditions. The poor catalytic performance of the high doped system can be attributed to a competing H2 reduction of In3+. The results provide new insight into how pairing photo and thermal conditions with the methodical tuning of the Lewis acidity and Lewis basicity of surface frustrated Lewis acid-base pair sites by varying z amount in BizIn2-zO3-x(OH)y enables optimization of the rate of the photochemical RWGS.

However, using two case studies from Guangdong and Jilin, we show that there could be significant variation in performance and willingness to conduct experimentation among the climate pilots.

One of them is composed of three global climate models (GCMs), and the other of eight regional climate models (RCMs) from the Coordinated Regional Climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX). The present (1970–2005) and the future (2006–2100) climate trends are analyzed for representative pathway scenarios 4.5 (RCP4.5) and 8.5 (RCP8.5). For the most pessimistic scenario (RCP8.5), trends in water resources are assessed considering the terrestrial branch of the hydrologic cycle by analyzing the precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P-ET). For the present climate, RCMs added value to the GCMs in simulating more realistic precipitation fields in several regions. GCMs and RCMs project, in general, the same precipitation change signal for the end of the 21st century over SA, which is stronger in RCP8.5 than in RCP4.5. For RCP8.5 in most regions, GCMs and RCMs ensembles have the same precipitation trend signal, but a great spread between the ensemble members, which is greater in austral summer than winter, can be noted. In winter a negative trend in rainfall in most members and regions predominates. At the end of the 21st century, relative changes in rainfall in RCP8.5 are in the range of +14% (over northeastern Brazil in summer) to − 36% (over the Andes Mountains in winter). In RCP8.5, the ensembles project an increase in air temperature with a similar magnitude, while in RCP4.5 the trends are weaker. For air temperature, there is small spread between members, and the positive trend is statistically significant for all ensemble members in the RCP8.5 scenario. In terms of water resources, on an annual scale, for RCP8.5 the RCM ensemble projects a larger area with wetter conditions in the future than GCMs. Regionally, it is expected a decrease in water availability in the Amazon basin and an increase over northeast Brazil and southeast SA during the summer. In other regions (northern Amazon, the Andes Mountains and Patagonia) the ensembles indicate drier conditions in the future winter, except in southern Amazon. It is expected that such information could be useful for devising adaptation and mitigation policies due to climate change over the SA. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate projections; CORDEX; South America; Water resources trend, regional and global models","climate modeling; climate prediction; downscaling; ensemble forecasting; global climate; precipitation assessment; regional climate; trend analysis; water resource; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074020173

The influence of anthropogenic aerosols on this extreme rainfall event is examined using a coupled meteorology-chemistry-aerosol model. Up to 33.7&thinsp;mm precipitation enhancement in the estuary and near the coast is mainly attributed to aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI), whereas aerosol-radiation interaction partially offsets 14&thinsp;% of the precipitation increase. Our further analysis of changes in hydrometeors and latent heat sources suggests that the ACI effects on the intensification of precipitation can be divided into two stages: cold rain enhancement in the former stage followed by warm rain enhancement in the latter. Responses of precipitation to the changes in anthropogenic aerosol concentration from local (i.e., Guangdong Province) and remote (i.e., outside Guangdong Province) sources are also investigated through simulations with reduced aerosol emissions from either local or remote sources. Accumulated aerosol concentration from local sources aggregates mainly near the ground surface and dilutes quickly after the precipitation initiated. By contrast, the aerosols from remote emissions extend up to 8&thinsp;km above ground and last much longer before decreasing until peak rainfall begins, because aerosols are continuously transported by the strong northerly winds. The patterns of precipitation response to remote and local aerosol concentrations resemble each other. However, compared with local aerosols through warm rain enhancement, remote aerosols contribute more than twice the precipitation increase by intensifying both cold and warm rain, occupying a predominant role. A 10-time emission sensitivity test shows about 10 times the PM<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">2.5</span> concentration compared with the control run. Cold (warm) rain is drastically enhanced (suppressed) in the <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">10×</span> run. In response to <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">10×</span> aerosol emissions, the pattern of precipitation and cloud property changes resembles the differences between CTL and CLEAN, but with a much greater magnitude. The precipitation average over Guangdong decreases by 1.0&thinsp;mm in the <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">10×</span> run but increases by 1.4&thinsp;mm in the control run compared with the CLEAN run. We note that the precipitation increase is concentrated within a more narrowed downstream region of the aerosol source, whereas the precipitation decrease is more dispersed across the upstream region. This indicates that the excessive aerosols not<span idCombining double low line""page224""/> only suppress rainfall, but also change the spatial distribution of precipitation, increasing the rainfall range, thereby potentially exacerbating flood and drought elsewhere. This study highlights the importance of considering aerosols in meteorology to improve extreme weather forecasting. Furthermore, aerosols from remote emissions may outweigh those from local emissions in the convective invigoration effect. © 2020.

During large-scale infestations, aerial spraying of bacterial insecticides is used to suppress local high-density SBW populations. While the primary goal of spraying is the protection of wood volume for later harvest, it should also maintain carbon stored in trees. This study provides the first quantitative analysis of the efficacy of aerial spraying against SBW on carbon dynamics in balsam fir, spruce, and mixed fir–spruce forests. In this study, we used the TRIPLEX-Insect model to simulate carbon dynamics with and without spray applications in 14 sites of the boreal forest located in various regions of Québec. We found that the efficacy of aerial spraying on reducing annual defoliation was greater in the early stage (<5 yr since the outbreak began) of the outbreak than in later (5–10 yr since the outbreak began) stage. Our results showed that more net ecosystem productivity is maintained in balsam fir (the most vulnerable species) than in either spruce or mixed fir–spruce forests following spraying. Also, average losses in aboveground biomass due to the SBW following spraying occurred more slowly than without spraying in balsam fir forests. Our findings suggest that aerial spraying could be used to maintain carbon in conifer forests during SBW disturbances, but that the efficacy of spray programs is affected by host species and stage of the SBW outbreak. © 2020 The Authors.","annual defoliation; Btk; forest protection; natural disturbance; net ecosystem productivity; TRIPLEX-insect",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078981624

To sustain this growth trajectory, continued cost and capital expenditure (capex) reductions are needed. Thinning the silicon wafer well below the industry-standard 160 μm, in principle reduces both manufacturing cost and capex, and accelerates economically-sustainable expansion of PV manufacturing. In this analysis piece, we explore two questions surrounding adoption of thin silicon wafers: (a) What are the market benefits of thin wafers? (b) What are the technological challenges to adopt thin wafers? In this analysis, we re-evaluate the benefits and challenges of thin Si for current and future PV modules using a comprehensive technoeconomic framework that couples device simulation, bottom-up cost modeling, and a sustainable cash-flow growth model. When adopting an advanced technology concept that features sufficiently good surface passivation, the comparable efficiencies are achievable for both 50 μm wafers and 160 μm ones. We then quantify the economic benefits for thin Si wafers in terms of poly-Si-to-module manufacturing capex, module cost, and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for utility PV systems. Particularly, LCOE favors thinner wafers for all investigated device architectures, and can potentially be reduced by more than 5% from the value of 160 μm wafers. With further improvements in module efficiency, an advanced device concept with 50 μm wafers could potentially reduce manufacturing capex by 48%, module cost by 28%, and LCOE by 24%. Furthermore, we apply a sustainable growth model to investigate PV deployment scenarios in 2030. It is found that the state-of-the-art industry concept could not achieve the climate targets even with very aggressive financial scenarios, therefore the capex reduction benefit of thin wafers is advantageous to facilitate faster PV adoption. Lastly, we discuss the remaining technological challenges and areas for innovation to enable high-yield manufacturing of high-efficiency PV modules with thin Si wafers. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Chromium compounds; Commerce; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Efficiency; Growth rate; Manufacture; Passivation; Photovoltaic cells; Capital expenditures; Crystalline silicons; Deployment scenarios; Device architectures; High-yield manufacturing; Levelized cost of electricities; Module manufacturing; Technological challenges; Silicon wafers; economic analysis; electricity generation; manufacturing; photovoltaic system; silicon; solar power; technological development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078542571

However, their slow reaction kinetics hinders the improvement in electrochemical performance. Herein, a hybrid structure of P-doped Co3O4 (P-Co3O4) ultrafine nanoparticles in situ encapsulated into P, N co-doped carbon (P, N-C) nanowires by a pyrolysis–oxidation–phosphorization of 1D metal–organic frameworks derived from Co-layered double hydroxide as self-template and reactant is reported. This hybrid structure prevents active material agglomeration and maintains a 1D oriented arrangement, which exhibits a large accessible surface area and hierarchically porous feature, enabling sufficient permeation and transfer of electrolyte ions. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the P dopants in P-Co3O4@P, N-C could reduce the adsorption energy of OH− and regulate the electrical properties. Accordingly, the P-Co3O4@P, N-C delivers a high specific capacity of 669 mC cm−2 at 1 mA cm−2 and an ultralong cycle life with only 4.8% loss over 5000 cycles at 30 mA cm−2. During the fabrication of P-Co3O4@P, N-C, Co@P, N-C is simultaneously developed, which can be integrated with P-Co3O4@P, N-C for the assembly of asymmetric supercapacitors.

The objectives of this study were i) to assess the impact of extended drought followed by heavy precipitation events on yield and soil organic carbon (SOC) under historical and future climate, and ii) to evaluate the effectiveness of climate adaptation strategies (notillage and new cultivars) in mitigating impacts of increased frequencies of extreme events and warming. We used the validated SALUS crop model to simulate long-term maize and wheat yield and SOC changes of maize-soybean-wheat rotation cropping systems in the northern Midwest USA under conventional tillage and no-till for three climate change scenarios (one historical and two projected climates under the Representative Concentration Path (RCP) 4.5 and RCP6) and two precipitation changes (extreme precipitation occurring early or late season). Extended drought events caused additional yield reduction when they occurred later in the season (10-22% for maize and 5-13% for wheat) rather than in early season (5-17% for maize and 2-18% for wheat). We found maize grain yield declined under the projected climates, whereas wheat grain yield increased. No-tillage is able to reduce yield loss compared to conventional tillage and increased SOC levels (1.4-2.0 t/ha under the three climates), but could not reverse the adverse impact of climate change, unless early and new improved maize cultivars are introduced to increase yield and SOC under climate change. This study demonstrated the need to consider extreme weather events, particularly drought and extreme precipitation events, in climate impact assessment on crop yield and adaptation through no-tillage and new genetics reduces yield losses. © 2020 Liu, Basso.

The central government of China established the National Environmental Protection Model City award scheme to evaluate cities’ environmental quality and economic performance. China has a unique political system called regionally decentralized authoritarian system. The central government have recently recognized that the PM2.5 pollution problem is a regional issue that is not limited to a single city. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Wenjie Wu and Yiming Wang.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108770976

A novel energy management strategy considering the battery cycling aging, grid relief and local time-of-use pricing is proposed based on TRNSYS. Both single-criterion and multi-criterion optimizations are conducted by comprehensively considering technical, economic and environmental performances of the system based on decision-making strategies including the weighted sum and minimum distance to the utopia point methods. The single-criterion optimizations achieve superior performances in the energy supply, battery storage, utility grid and whole system aspect respectively over the existing scenario of the target building. The multi-criterion optimization considering all performance indicators shows that the PV self-consumption and PV efficiency can be increased by 15.0% and 48.6% while the standard deviation of net grid power, battery cycling aging and CO2 emission can be reduced by 3.4%, 78.5% and 34.7% respectively. The significance and impact of design parameters are further quantified by both local and global sensitivity analyses.

We demonstrate its utility on eight large and isolated US power plants, where accurate stack emission estimates of both gases are available for comparison. In the first step of our methodology, we infer nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from US power plants using Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) NO2 tropospheric vertical column densities (VCDs) averaged over the ozone season (May-September) and a ""top-down"" approach that we previously developed. Second, we determine the relationship between NOx and CO2 emissions based on the direct stack emissions measurements reported by continuous emissions monitoring system (CEMS) programs, accounting for coal quality, boiler firing technology, NOx emission control device type, and any change in operating conditions. Third, we estimate CO2 emissions for power plants using the OMI-estimated NOx emissions and the CEMS NOx/CO2 emission ratio. We find that the CO2 emissions estimated by our satellite-based method during 2005-2017 are in reasonable agreement with the US CEMS measurements, with a relative difference of 8% ±41% (mean ± standard deviation). The broader implication of our methodology is that it has the potential to provide an additional constraint on CO2 emissions from power plants in regions of the world without reliable emissions accounting. We explore the feasibility by comparing the derived NOx/CO2 emission ratios for the US with those from a bottom-up emission inventory for other countries and applying our methodology to a power plant in South Africa, where the satellite-based emission estimates show reasonable consistency with other independent estimates. Though our analysis is limited to a few power plants, we expect to be able to apply our method to more US (and world) power plants when multi-year data records become available from new OMI-like sensors with improved capabilities, such as the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), and upcoming geostationary satellites, such as the Tropospheric Emissions: Monitoring Pollution (TEMPO) instrument. © Author(s) 2020.",,"atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coal-fired power plant; concentration (composition); nitrogen dioxide; ozone; satellite imagery; South Africa; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077592160

The case study presented here provides an in-depth analysis of a small group of Native American high school students whose film depicts a strong connection to place and includes stories about their personal experiences of the impacts of drought on their community. LOCC’s focus on the communities where students live was maintained even when students participated in a workshop outside of their home communities. Even in this unique context for a place-based program, the students drew meaningful connections to home and to a critical environmental challenge that impacted their community through their films and filmmaking processes. Follow-up interviews with the students suggested that the LOCC program experience was transformative for them with regard to their personal actions around environmental challenges and their approaches to thinking and communicating about climate change. LOCC’s focus on place and storytelling through film helped students find greater personal meaning in the geoscience topics they were learning and may be a useful model for other education programs in geoscience.

This development has been met by growing opposition from local citizens and their initiatives. There is an ongoing debate about whether and how such protests have a real impact on the development of energy landscapes. Methods: Drawing on the rare case of a state government scaling back ambitious targets for the expansion of renewables, the authors were able to analyse the impact of protests in the context of regional spatial planning and, particularly, state policy-making on energy. Conceptually drawing on the Advocacy Coalition Framework and using the method of causal-process tracing, the qualitative study investigates related interactions and decision-making processes in the federal state of Saxony, Germany, between 2011 - when targets were increased - and 2013 - when targets were scaled back. Results: The findings show that the protests grew significantly when the raised expansion targets for renewables were translated into a higher number of potential wind farm sites. The protests, which primarily referred to landscapes, were well-organised and creative. Activists worked through a range of channels across various contexts and several levels of the politico-administrative system, in particular approaching regional spatial planners and a wide range of politicians. In the end, the protests (along with other factors) significantly contributed to the readjustment by the Saxon coalition government of its energy and climate policy and thus to a slowdown of energy-related landscape change. Conclusions: The study confirms that the influence of protesters can greatly exceed the previously studied participation in the planning of sites and the approval process for individual wind farms. Also highlighting other relevant co-influential factors, the paper contributes to the development of a middle-range theory of the impact of local opposition to wind power in the context of energy landscapes. © 2020 The Author(s).","Energy policy; Landscape policy; Protest; Renewables; Spatial planning; Wind power","Decision making; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Global warming; Advocacy coalition framework; Coalition government; Decision making process; Energy and climate policies; Middle-range theory; Protest; Renewables; Spatial planning; Wind power; alternative energy; energy planning; energy policy; environmental policy; landscape planning; policy making; spatial planning; wind farm; wind power; Germany; Saxony",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078986907

These businesses seek to reduce their CO2e (carbon dioxide equivalent) emissions and costs simultaneously by implementing sustainable and innovative concepts. The food trade can make a substantial contribution to reducing CO2e emissions with its significant share of the overall transport industry’s volume. Lidl, one of the largest German food retailers, features a particularly extensive distribution network within the metropolitan regions. One of these innovative concepts for reducing CO2e emissions involves the use of longer trucks, which could reduce the food industry’s emissions by 15-25%. This study’s goal is to analyse and assess the potential of this proposed change for Lidl and to develop recommendations for action. In addition to a comprehensive literature review, guided expert interviews were conducted with forwarding agents using the longer trucks. Following this, a quantitative analysis of transport routes was performed, and the distance-based method was employed for CO2e calculations. In a Germany-wide transport system from one supplier to one hub, annual CO2e savings of 21.2% and cost savings of 29.8% can be achieved. Significantly more potential exists to extend the use of longer trucks to various other suppliers and hubs. For example, Lidl delivers to 36 other hubs in Germany. Challenges for longer trucks include restrictions on certain routes throughout Europe, weight limits and the general prohibition of inner-city traffic. © Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature 2020.","Green Logistics; Innovation; Longer Truck; Metropolitan Region; Mobility; Retail; Sustainability",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089642328

This article addresses this gap; it draws on literature of political and environmental subjects to examine how political authorities use global climate change knowledge to form ‘climate subjects.’ It argues that through formation of climate subjects, political authorities can steer the climate change response and simultaneously reproduce structures of political authority. The article takes Vietnam as a case. Vietnam is projected to be one of the countries most affected by climate change, and political authorities have been active in responding, with policies emphasizing knowledge dissemination. The article traces the influence of global climate change knowledge in Vietnamese climate change policy through analysis of national policymaking. It then examines policy implementation and subject formation in sub-national levels of government, as sub-national officials’ climate subjectivities are a potent political tool. Such ‘street-level bureaucrats’ translate policy to practice and shape local climate change responses, livelihoods and lives. The article draws on interviews with sub-national officials and document review of sub-national climate change policies and training documents. The article finds that climate subject formation in Vietnam reflects and contributes to the reproduction of existing political and economic structures. It thereby limits alternative visions of climate change response. This indicates the importance of diverse forms of knowledge–ontologies, epistemologies and conceptualizations of climate change–to support transformational responses rather than functional persistence. © 2019, © 2019 Norwegian Institute of International Affairs (NUPI).","climate change adaptation; knowledge; political subject; street-level bureaucrats; subjectivities; Vietnam","adaptive management; bureaucracy; climate change; environmental policy; knowledge; national planning; political economy; political participation; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075085460

The 95 watersheds feeding local reservoirs are facing challenges from a changing environment and population growth. The investment funding was mainly used for sediment reduction, forest restoration, and stream conservation. The results showed that the greatest environmental benefits resulted from water quality improvement (49%), followed by ensuring a steady water supply (20%), and hydropower supply (16%). Environmental benefits from water quantity improvement (8%), forest restoration (5%), and carbon reduction (2%) totaled US$2 million in 2018. The calculation of costs and environmental benefits from 2018 to 2047 using a social rate of discount of 1.156% revealed that the environmental benefits that minimized the effects of natural disasters were the most expensive (US$115.6 million), followed by those that achieved sediment reduction over 10 y (US$6.9 million). It was calculated that by 2046 (29th y after investment), regardless of the investment cost, the total value of environmental benefits would exceed the operation and maintenance costs. The overall cost-benefit analysis revealed a value of 1.055, which compares favorably with the values for other infrastructure projects in Taiwan.

This understanding has become increasingly dominated by narratives of the urban sustainability fix, which stresses the logic of capital accumulation. Within the broader structural processes of ecological modernization, such as transitioning to low-carbon growth, consideration of—let alone interest in—the diversity of local politics that shapes the practice and forms of contestation of eco-urbanism has often been relegated to a position of secondary importance.

Population growth has reduced the amount of space available in cities, and climate change challenges plant growth thresholds. Urban community gardens provide dynamic socio-ecological systems to study how such social and environmental change factors affect the management and delivery of ecosystem services. They provide spaces where urban citizens purposefully interact with nature and receive multiple benefits. In this paper, we synthesize the results of three years of research in a case study of urban community gardens across the Central Coast of California and present a framework showing how both social and environmental change factors at the regional scale affect the ecological make-up of urban community gardens, which in turn affect the ecosystem services coming from such systems. Our study reveals that global environmental change felt at the regional level (e.g., increased built environment, climate change) interact with social change and policy (e.g., population growth, urbanization, water use policy), thus affecting regulations over garden resources (e.g., water availability) and management decisions by gardeners (e.g., soil management, crop planting decisions). These management decisions at the plot-scale, determine the ecological complexity and quality of the gardens and affect the resulting ecosystem services that come from these systems, such as food provision for both humans and urban animals. A greater understanding of how environmental and social change factors drive the management processes of urban community gardens is necessary to design policy support systems that encourage the continued use and benefits arising from such green spaces. Policies that can support urban community gardens to maintain ecological complexity and increase biodiversity through active management of soil quality and plant diversity have the potential to increase social and environmental outcomes that feedback to the larger environmental and social system. © 2019","Adaptive decision making; Climatic services; Community gardens; Crop choice; Socio-ecological systems; Urban food production","adaptive management; biodiversity; decision making; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; environmental change; food production; garden; global change; greenspace; population growth; soil quality; urban area; California; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074763571

However, such method would result in a large amount of GHG emissions. China intends to change the heating method of its citizens from coal burning to electric heating to save energy, reduce emissions, which is called the project of Coal to Electricity (CtE). A dynamic recursive computable general equilibrium model is applied to analyze the real effect if the project is widely promoted in China. We found that CtE project is effective in reducing SO2 and NOx emission than CO2 emissions. In essence, energy substitution is not energy-saving, so the contribution to CO2 reduction of CtE project is limited. There is a certain co-benefit between CtE project and other energy saving policies (new energy generation, improving heating efficiency and building energy saving etc.). The findings indicate that single CtE policy can only bring better air quality. However, with other energy saving policies, CtE project can not only bring NOx and SO2 reduction, but also lead to less CO2 emissions and more convenient life. Multiple emission reduction measures are suggested to maximize the reduction effects of these policies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions; Coal to electricity project; Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model; Energy consumption; SO2 and NOx emission","Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Heating; Nitrogen oxides; Building energy saving; CO2 emissions; Computable general equilibrium model; Electricity policy; Emission reduction; Energy saving policies; Heating efficiencies; NOx emissions; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; coal; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coal supply; computable general equilibrium analysis; economic impact; electricity supply; energy policy; energy use; environmental impact; nitrogen oxides; sulfur dioxide; air quality; Article; bioenergy; carbon footprint; China; coal gasification; coal power; combustion; electricity; energy conservation; energy consumption; energy resource; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental policy; heat transfer; nitrous oxide emission; priority journal; room temperature; social welfare; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071717733

The measurements of the exhaust emissions were performed for CO2/fuel consumption, CO, THC and NOx. The RDE measurements were performed including the engine operating parameters and emissions analysis. This analysis shows that the engines of BEVs and PHEVs operate in a different parameter range when under actual operating conditions, which directly translates into the exhaust emission values. This is particularly the case for the emission of NOx. The investigations were carried out for two routes differentiated by the length and share of the urban and extra-urban cycles. For both routes, the emission of THC and CO were lower for the PHEV engine – HC by 69% (22 mg/km, route 1) and 6% (15 mg/km, route 2), CO by 69% (0.12 mg/km, route 1) and 80% (0.1 mg/km, route 2). For route 1, characterized by a greater share of the urban cycle, the emission of NOx was lower by 70% (2 mg/km) for the BEV engine, and (route 2) lower by 60% (8 mg/km) for the PHEV engine. Additionally, the curves of the exhaust emissions in time for individual exhaust components have been presented that indicate that in the motorway cycle the emission of THC and CO from the BEV vehicle increases significantly up to ten times compared to urban cycle. © 2019 The Authors","Battery electric car; Exhaust emissions; Plug-in hybrid car; Real driving emissions","Air pollution; Battery electric vehicles; Engines; Nitrogen oxides; Combustion engines; Electric cars; Exhaust emission; Operating condition; Operating parameters; Phev (plugin hybrid electric vehicle); Plug-in hybrids; Real drivings; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; car use; combustion; electric vehicle; exhaust emission; testing method; travel behavior; urban transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076549040

However, the impact of human activities on these proxies has been little constrained, which might cause the misinterpretation of the sediment profile. In order to study the climatic and human impact on the environment, proxies in coastal regions, glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (GDGTs) in a sediment core spanning 115 years was analyzed from Beibu Gulf, China. The results indicate that isoprenoid GDGTs in the Beibu Gulf were mainly derived from Thaumarchaeota and the branched GDGTs originated mainly from terrestrial soil bacteria. The TEX86 index was applied to reconstruct the temporal SST variation. The results show that variation of TEX86-derived SST is controlled mainly by East Asian Monsoon system and partly by ENSO events. The methylation index of branched tetraethers or the cyclization index of branched tetraethers (MBT/CBT) derived mean annual air temperature (MAAT) agreed with MAAT record at the Qinzhou Station before 1982 AD. However, the population growth and economic development after 1982 AD caused the reduction of terrestrial organic matter input and increase of nutrient, leading to the thriving of Thaumarchaeota and increasing of in situ branched GDGTs proportion, which created the scatter of the MBT/CBT-reconstructed MAAT after 1982 AD. Therefore, human influence on GDGT proxies can be constrained in this way to avoid misinterpretation of paleoclimate and paleoenvironment records. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Anthropogenic influences; BIT; East Asian monsoon; GDGTs; Temperature reconstruction","air temperature; anthropogenic effect; climate effect; economic development; ether; isoprenoid; lipid; methylation; monsoon; organic matter; paleoclimate; paleoenvironment; population growth; sea surface temperature; sediment core; China; Gulf of Tonkin; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076459248

Results showed that attapulgite addition increased methane yield by 8.9%–37.3% and affected methane production kinetics. Attapulgite with the addition loading of 10 g/L obtained the highest methane yield of 210.4 mL/g volatile solids. Attapulgite accelerated the rates of hydrolysis, acetogenesis, and methanogenesis, as evidenced by the increases in the activities of β-glucosidase, protease, dehydrogenase, and coenzyme F420; the abundance of hydrolytic and acetogenic bacteria (Clostridiales, Syntrophobacterales, and Fibrobacterales); and the abundance of methanogenic microorganisms (Methanomicrobiales). These phenomena can be ascribed to both the reduced ammonia nitrogen due to attapulgite adsorption and the increased trace elements, such as Ca2+, Mg2+, K+, and Fe3+ ions, due to attapulgite release. However, excessive dose of attapulgite (≥30 g/L) decreased the promotion of methane production by reducing the enzyme activities of hydrolytic and methanogenic steps and lowering the abundance of hydrolytic, acetogenic, and methanogenic microorganisms due to the high levels of free ammonia and metal ions, such as Mg2+, at the initial phase of digestion.

We provide observational evidence that increased foliage cover over the Northern Hemisphere, during 1982–2011, triggers an additional soil moisture deficit that is further carried over into summer. Climate model simulations independently support this and attribute the driving process to be larger increases in evapotranspiration than in precipitation. This extra soil drying is projected to amplify the frequency and intensity of summer heatwaves. Most feedbacks operate locally, except for a notable teleconnection where extra moisture transpired over Europe is transported to central Siberia. Model results illustrate that this teleconnection offsets Siberian soil moisture losses from local spring greening. Our results highlight that climate change adaptation planning must account for the extra summer water and heatwave stress inherited from warming-induced earlier greening.

Moreover, cross-domain data interoperability between concepts used by the numerous hardware and software is essential, in terms of Terminology, Metadata, Meaning and Logic. This paper leverages domain ontology to map and align the semantic resources that underpin building and district energy management, with a focus on the optimization of a thermal grid informed by real-time energy demand. The intelligence of the system is derived from simulation-based optimization, informed by calibrated thermal models that predict the network's energy demand to inform (near) real-time generation.

The electrons were gradually consumed on the cathodes, and 25%–45% of which were recovered to reduce bicarbonate to acetic acid during MEC operation. Firmicutes was the dominant bacterial phylum on the cathodes, and Bacillus genus within this phylum was greatly enriched and was the most abundant population among the detected putative electrotrophs for almost all soils. Furthermore, several other members of Firmicutes and Proteobacteria may also participate in electrotrophic process in different soils. Soil pH, amorphous iron and electrical conductivity significantly influenced the putative electrotrophic bacterial community, which explained about 33.5% of the community structural variation. This study provides a basis for understanding the microbial diversity of putative electrotrophs in paddy soils, and highlights the importance of soil properties in shaping the community of putative electrotrophs. © 2019","Electrotroph; Microbial community; Microbial electrolysis cell; Paddy soil; Soil property","Bacteria; Bacteriology; Biochemistry; Bioremediation; Cathodes; Electrolysis; Electrolytic cells; Regenerative fuel cells; RNA; Soils; Bacterial community; Electrical conductivity; Electrotroph; Microbial communities; Microbial diversity; Paddy soils; Soil property; Structural variations; Microbial fuel cells; bioremediation; electrical conductivity; electrokinesis; microbial community; paddy field; RNA; soil property; Bacillus (bacterium); Bacteria (microorganisms); Firmicutes; Proteobacteria; RNA 16S; agriculture; bioenergy; chemistry; electrode; microbiology; microflora; Oryza; soil; Agriculture; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Electrodes; Microbiota; Oryza; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070877225

Planning and operation of a hydrogen supply system with multiple generation and transmission technologies, multiple consumers, and large infrastructure among regions are challenging tasks. Seasonal fluctuation of generation and demand would further make the problem more complex. In this paper, a long-period, multi-region and monthly-scale optimization model is developed, and China is taken as a case study. The optimal planning and operation strategy of China's hydrogen supply system before 2050 could be obtained by minimizing the overall system cost. Two scenarios are provided describing coal-based and power-based generation pathways. The overall costs in the power-based pathway is 2.4 times than the coal-based pathway due to higher cost of power. If zero carbon emissions are required, the economic balance point of two pathways would be when CCS cost is 525 yuan/tCO2. Furthermore, system planning is quite different in two pathways. Generation capacity would concentrate more in North China in the coal-based pathway, and nationwide pipeline networks are required in the power-based pathway. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","China; Hydrogen; Modelling; Optimization; Planning",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092800134

However, the main drivers of plant species diversity in montane forests are still not clear. In addition, most existing studies make no distinction between direct and indirect effects of environmental factors and spatial constraints on plant biodiversity. Using data from 107 montane forest plots in Sichuan Giant Panda habitat, China, we quantified the direct and indirect effects of abiotic environmental factors, spatial constraints, and plant functional traits on plant community diversity. Our results showed significant correlations between abiotic environmental factors and trees (r =.10, p value =.001), shrubs (r =.19, p value =.001), or overall plant diversity (r =.18, p value =.001) in montane forests. Spatial constraints also showed significant correlations with trees and shrubs. However, no significant correlations were found between functional traits and plant community diversity. Moreover, the diversity (richness and abundance) of shrubs, trees, and plant communities was directly affected by precipitation, latitude, and altitude. Mean annual temperature (MAT) had no direct effect on the richness of tree and plant communities. Further, MAT and precipitation indirectly affected plant communities via the tree canopy. The results revealed a stronger direct effect on montane plant diversity than indirect effect, suggesting that single-species models may be adequate for forecasting the impacts of climate factors in these communities. The shifting of tree canopy coverage might be a potential indicator for trends of plant diversity under climate change. © 2019 The Authors.

Biological activated carbon (BAC) filter as a tertiary process was used to study the influence of tetracycline (TC) on nitrogen removal efficiency during exposure to tetracycline at different concentrations (0, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 5 mg/L) in an easily separated biofilm (interstitial organism) and inner biofilm (carbon-attached organism). High throughput sequencing and QPCR showed that exposure of 5 mg/L tetracycline increased the denitrifying genes (DNGs) and genera containing denitrification function (e.g., Acidovorax, Flavobacterium, unclassified_f_Comamonadaceae). Moreover, DNGs were mainly located in carbon-attached organisms, while the resistance genes were primarily found in interstitial organisms. The presence of TC stimulated the generation of resistance genes and DNGs, leading to enhanced nitrogen removal. Approximately 90% of the total resistance genes in interstitial organisms and 85% of the TC were effectively removed in the developed biofilm system. Overall, the results indicated that the biofilm system was a good choice for treatment of sewage treatment with a certain amount of TC and control over the contamination of resistance genes. © 2019 Taiwan Institute of Chemical Engineers","Biofilm system; Carbon-attached organisms; Denitrifying genes; Interstitial organisms; Tetracycline resistance gene","Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Antibiotics; Biofilms; Biology; Denitrification; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Filtration; Nitrogen removal; Sewage treatment; Wastewater treatment; Antibiotic resistance genes; Biofilm systems; Biological activated carbon; High-throughput sequencing; Interstitial organisms; Nitrogen removal efficiency; Resistance genes; Wastewater treatment plants; Genes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075479905

Karst caves in Chongzuo, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region of south China are famous for numerous studies on their abundant mammalian fossils and most importantly, Homo sapiens. Unfortunately, the environmental backgrounds, e.g. vegetation and climate, that governed these faunas, are usually lacking because there is no appropriate proxy. In this work, we analysed the palynological assemblages from seven well-dated karst caves in Chongzuo. The ages of these seven caves (2.0–0.11 Ma) cover almost the entire Pleistocene. Though the number of pollen and spores is comparatively low, as expected, we managed to reconstruct the principle vegetation types. The results show that the individual vegetations were mainly warm temperate to subtropical evergreen and deciduous broad-leaved mixed forests.

NH3 levels can be impacted by various emission standards. However, there is a lack of investigations of the influences from the implementation of different vehicular emission standards on long-term changes in NH3 emissions. To fill this gap, we estimated the inter-annual NH3 emissions of light-duty gasoline vehicles (LDGVs) under different emission standards (State 0 to State V) from 1999 to 2017 and investigated the emission change characteristics under the rapidly developing Chinese economy. Results showed that the NH3 emissions from LDGVs had a sharp, 42-fold increase (from 1.8 Gg to 77.9 Gg). However, NH3 emissions per capita have begun to decrease with increases in socioeconomic development, presenting an inverted U-shaped tendency as a function of per capita GDP. Further exploration indicated that the decline in emission factors, as determined by upgrades in emission standards, was the decisive factor in promoting the downward trend in per capita emissions. This suggests that continuously upgrading emission standards has offset the increase in NH3 emissions due to the rapid growth of motor vehicles. Quantitative scenario analysis showed a two-stage impact of emission standards on NH3 emissions: emissions would decrease 77% (48%–90% for different years) if State I and State II were not implemented; while if none of standards were upgraded (State III to State V), NH3 emissions would increase 118% (13%–224% for different years), 2–6 times the impacts from the growth of vehicle population and the decline of vehicle kilometres traveled.

The primary components in the stack flue gas were ethylene, 1-butene, benzene, acetylene, and 2,2-dimethylbutane for the nonrecovery plant and styrene, benzene, and ethylene for the mechanical plant. The fugitive emissions were also monitored at the mechanical plant, and the most abundant species leaking from the oven were benzene, toluene, ethane, m-xylene, and ethylene, whereas those leaking from byproducts were benzene, propane, ethane, ethylene, n-pentane, n-butane, isobutene, 1butene, toluene, and propylene. The stack flue gas at the non-recovery and mechanical coking plants exhibited VOC emission factors of 96 g Mg–1-coke and 0.4 g Mg–1-coke, respectively; thus, VOCs released by the former merit greater concern. Since the highest ozone formation potential (OFP) was observed for the stack flue gas at the non-recovery plant (80.26 mg m–3), followed by fugitive oven emissions at the mechanical plant (7.22 mg m–3), controlling these VOCs will significantly reduce their conversion into ozone.

The regional air pollution has had a serious impact on people's health; thus, all levels of government have implemented various pollution prevention measures since 2013. Based on multi-city in situ environmental and meteorological data, as well as the meteorological reanalysis dataset from 2013 to 2017, regional pollution characteristics and meteorological formation mechanisms were analyzed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the evolution of PM2.5 in NC. The domain-averaged PM2.5 was 79 ± 17 µg m−3 from 2013 to 2017, with a decreasing rate of 10 μg m−3 yr−1. Two automatic computer algorithms were established to identify 6 daily regional pollution types (DRPTs) and 48 persistent regional pollution events (PRPEs) over NC during 2014–2017. The average PM2.5 concentration for the Large-Region-Pollution type (including the Large-Moderate-Region-Pollution and Large-Severe-Region-Pollution types) was 113 ± 40 µg m−3, and more than half of Large-Region-Pollution days and PRPEs occurred in winter. The PRPEs in NC mainly developed from the area south of Hebei. The number of Large-Region-Pollution days decreased notably from 2014 to 2017, the annual number of days varying between 194 and 97 days, whereas a slight decline was observed in winter. In addition, the averaged PM2.5 concentrations and the numbers and durations of the PRPEs decreased. Lamb-Jenkinson weather typing was used to reveal the impact of synoptic circulations on PM2.5 across NC. Generally, the contributions of the variations in circulation to the reduction in PM2.5 levels over NC between 2013 and 2017 were 64% and 45% in summer and winter, respectively. The three most highly polluted weather types were types C, S and E, with an average PM2.5 concentration of 137 ± 40 µg m−3 in winter. Furthermore, three typical circulation dynamics were categorized in the peak stage of the PRPEs, namely, the southerly airflow pattern, the northerly airflow pattern and anticyclone pattern; the averaged relative humidity, recirculation index, wind speed and boundary layer height were 63%, 0.33, 2.0 m s−1 and 493 m, respectively. Our results imply that additional emission reduction measures should be implemented under unfavorable meteorological situations to attain ambient air quality standards in the future. © 2019 The Authors","Identification of regional pollution type; Meteorological formation mechanism; North China; PM2.5; Regional pollution events","Air quality standards; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Emission control; Information dissemination; Meteorology; Wind; Ambient air quality standards; Boundary layer heights; Formation mechanism; North China; PM2.5; Regional air pollution; Regional pollution; Synoptic circulations; Air quality; air quality; algorithm; ambient air; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric dynamics; atmospheric pollution; formation mechanism; identification method; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; airflow; ambient air; article; boundary layer; China; human; humidity; lamb; nonhuman; summer; weather; wind speed; winter; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; China; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074942219

However, the current estimation methods have some drawbacks, such as not meeting China's situation, data obsolescence, and relatively high uncertainty. Moreover, there are large differences in estimated results among previous studies. To address these problems, this paper proposes a new provincial-level energy-related CO2 emission estimation method refer to methods at different levels in China and abroad. We re-divide the energy involved in a province based on energy flow and consumption-based responsibility and propose an accounting method for calculating provincial-level CO2 emission factors, which provides clear cross-provincial emission allocation and accurate provincial-level emission estimation. By taking Shandong Province as an example, we calculate the provincial-level CO2 emission factors and obtain the CO2 emissions from 2000 to 2016. Furthermore, the reasons for the large gaps between calculated CO2 emissions in Shandong are further quantitatively analyzed from the perspective of the method and data selection. The results indicate that although different methods greatly influence the estimation results, the gaps that arise from different selections of calculation scope, energy classification, activity data and CO2 emission factor within a method also require attention. Finally, some recommendations are proposed when making CO2 emission calculations or comparisons. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions; Energy consumption; Shandong Province","Energy utilization; Global warming; Obsolescence; Accounting methods; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emissions; Current estimation; Data Selection; Emission estimation; Estimation results; Shandong province; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; accuracy assessment; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; comparative study; emission inventory; energy use; uncertainty analysis; air pollution; analytic method; Article; calculation; case study; China; controlled study; energy; energy consumption; government; mathematical computing; measurement accuracy; policy; priority journal; China; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074338280

This paper selects 2000-2015 panel data from 30 provinces in China, evaluates the carbon emission efficiency of each province using the DEA method and, based on the STIRPAT expansion form, empirically looks at the effect of urbanization on carbon emission efficiency. The results show that, during the chosen time frame, not only did the carbon emission efficiency of China's provinces show an upward trend but the carbon emission efficiency of the Eastern, Central and Western regions differed markedly, with the highest efficiency in the Eastern region, the second highest in the Central region and the lowest in theWestern region. After controlling for population density, economic development level, energy intensity and industrial structure, urbanization we determine that urbanization can indeed improve carbon emission efficiency, although there are regional differences. Urbanization is conducive to improvements in carbon emission efficiency in both the Central andWestern regions but the promotion effect of the Western region is stronger. The effect in the Eastern region is not significant. Based on the conclusions above, this paper puts forward policy recommendations that promote both China's lower carbon efficiency and future environmental protection. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emission efficiency; DEA; Dynamic spatial panel; Urbanization","carbon emission; economic development; economic growth; environmental economics; environmental protection; industrial structure; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079484506

The loading of noble-metal co-catalysts can substantially improve the photocatalytic efficiency of semiconductors. Because the high cost and scarcity of noble metals markedly limit their large-scale applications, finding a noble-metal-alternative co-catalyst is crucial. MXene, a novel 2D transition metal material, has attracted considerable attention as a promising substitute for noble metal co-catalysts owing to its cost-efficiency, unique 2D layered structure, and excellent electrical, optical, and thermodynamic properties. This review focuses on the latest advancements in research on MXenes as co-catalysts in relatively popular photocatalytic applications (hydrogen production, CO2 reduction, nitrogen fixation, and organic pollutant oxidation). The synthesis methods and photocatalytic mechanisms of MXenes as co-catalysts are also summarized according to the type of MXene-based material. Finally, the crucial opportunities and challenges in the prospective development of MXene-based photocatalysts are outlined. We emphasize that modern techniques should be used to demonstrate the effects of MXenes on photocatalysis and that the photocatalytic activity of MXene-based photocatalysts can be further improved using defective engineering and recent phenomena such as the localized surface plasmon resonance effect and single-atom catalysis. © 2021 Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, the Chinese Academy of Sciences","CO2 reduction; Hydrogen production; MXenes; Nitrogen fixation; Photocatalytic degradation","Catalysts; Energy policy; Environmental technology; Hydrogen production; Nitrogen fixation; Organic pollutants; Photocatalytic activity; Surface plasmon resonance; Environmental problems; Large-scale applications; Layered Structures; Localized surface plasmon resonance; Photocatalytic application; Photocatalytic efficiency; Pollutant oxidation; Sustainable technology; Precious metals",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085560664

(iii) From the perspective of outputs, the technological progress of the three major urban agglomerations is significantly biased toward GDP with a slight difference among the three urban agglomerations, which means its technological progress is conducive to reduce CO2 intensity, symbolizing low carbon development.

In particular, a series of aerosol and trace gas monitoring instruments have been operating for more than a decade, providing the opportunity to analyze temporal trends of major pollutants on a large scale. In this study, we integrate aerosol products from MODIS (MODIS Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, all abbreviations and their definitions are listed alphabetically in Abbreviations) and MISR (Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer), the AAI (Absorbing Aerosol Index) product from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument), column SO2 and NO2 concentrations from OMI, and tropospheric column ozone concentration from OMI/MLS (Microwave Limb Sounder) to study temporal changes in major pollutants over China. MODIS and MISR consistently revealed that column AOD (Aerosol Optical Depth) increased from 2000, peaked around 2007, and started to decline afterward, except for northwest and northeast China, where a continuous upward trend was found. Extensive negative trends in both SO2 and NO2 have also been found over major pollution source regions since ~2005. On the other hand, the OMI AAI exhibited significant increases over north China, especially the northeast and northwest regions. These places also have a decreased Angstrom exponent as revealed by MISR, indicating an increased fraction of large particles. In general, summer had the largest AOD, SO2, and NO2 trends, whereas AAI trends were strongest for autumn and winter. A multi-regression analysis showed that much of the AOD variance over major pollution source regions could be explained by SO2, NO2, and AAI combined, and that the SO2 and NO2 reduction was likely to be responsible for the negative AOD trends, while the AOD increase over NE and NW China may be associated with an increase of coarse particles revealed by increased AAI and decreased AE. In contrast to aerosols, tropospheric ozone exhibited a steady increase from 2005 throughout China. This indicates that although the recent emission control effectively reduced aerosol pollutants, ozone remains a challenging issue and may dominate future air pollution. © 2020 by the authors.","Pollution trends inChina;multi-sensor satellite datasets;AOD; SO2;NO2; Tropospheric ozone","Aerosols; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Pollution detection; Radiometers; Regression analysis; Troposphere; Ultraviolet spectrometers; Absorbing aerosol indices; Multi sensor; Multi-regression analysis; Multiangle imaging spectroradiometer; Ozone monitoring instruments; SO2;NO2; Tropospheric column ozones; Tropospheric ozone; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081083433

Together, these changes are slowing the rate of growth in emissions, but the effects of individual policy measures are difficult to discern. In this study, we develop a high-resolution inventory of emissions factors for the coal-fired power industry in China, apply it to developing province-level emission factors, and demonstrate the relative effectiveness of four policy measures internal to the coal-fired power industry (namely, raising the entry threshold, eliminating outdated capacity, improving existing plants and enhancing operation loads) relative to external contributions from renewable power development in different provinces across China. We provide data for 49 power plant configurations covering 99.7% of the existing coal-fired power fleet in China during the 13th Five Year Plan period (2016–2020). We find that the provincial carbon emission factors of the coal-fired power industry are expected to decrease by 40–60 g CO2eq/kWh in 2020 compared with 2016, corresponding to a total carbon reduction potential of 265 Mt CO2eq across the industry. The four driving factors contribute various reductions in the carbon intensity by province and result in decreases in total emissions in Shanghai, Zhejiang and Beijing. For comparison, we calculate that the decarbonization potential from non-coal power deployment is 593 Mt CO2eq in 2020 compared with 2016, with the province-to-province variability mostly depending on the endowment of the non-coal resources. The variation across the country suggests that strategies for continued decarbonization beyond 2020 should be tailored to the specific situation in each province. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Carbon reduction potential; China; CO2; Coal-fired power","Carbon; Coal; Coal deposits; Decarbonization; Carbon emission factors; Carbon emissions; Carbon reduction potentials; China; Coal-fired power; High resolution inventories; Total carbon reduction; Variable renewable energies; Coal industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072606273

However, indicators of plant growth at this stage are not well established. With high elevations on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), terrestrial ecosystems in this region are vulnerable to climate change and in particular, the frequently and intensified droughts as projected by ecosystem models. To better understand the maximum plant growth potential and its response to drought over the past three decades (1982–2015), we analyzed the impacts of drought, as indicated by the Standardized Precipitation-Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), on two derived indicators of the maximum summer growth of plants, including the timing and the absolute value of the maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (referred as the peak of growing season, POS and NDVImax, respectively). We found that both temporal and spatial patterns of SPEI, POS and NDVImax showed high spatial heterogeneity over TP. A higher SPEI led to a later POS for about 57% of regions but it reversed for the alpine sparse vegetation roughly account for 3.5% of all pixels, probably due to water availability of this plant functional type. For NDVImax, we found a significantly enhanced NDVImax in summer for a higher SPEI over ~70% of significant pixels, irrespective of differences among plant functional types. We further analyzed these correlations by temperature and precipitation gradients and found that an annual precipitation around 550 mm seemed to be a threshold separating the positive and negative impacts of drought on NDVImax. These results would be useful to better comprehend the impacts of drought on ecosystem response in a changing climate in future. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Drought; NDVImax; SPEI; Tibetan Plateau","Climate models; Drought; Ecosystems; Pixels; Vegetation; NDVImax; Normalized difference vegetation index; Precipitation gradients; Spatial heterogeneity; SPEI; Temporal and spatial pattern; Terrestrial ecosystems; Tibetan Plateau; Climate change; air temperature; alpine environment; carbon balance; climate change; drought; ecosystem response; growth response; heterogeneity; NDVI; pixel; precipitation (climatology); satellite data; water availability; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072158433

In order to unravel the reaction mechanism to enhance the over-all HCHO decomposition efficiency and provide solid evidences to clarify the relationship between photocatalytic activity and reaction pathways, a combined experimental-theoretical approach has been developed in this work. By combining the active radical detection, in situ characterization technology and activation energy calculations, the special binary channel reactions in HCHO decomposition have been firstly discovered and proposed. Two separated reaction pathways are observed, including the pathway I of HCHO → HCOOH → H2CO3 → CO2 and pathway II of HCHO → HCOOH → CO → H2CO3 → CO2. HCOOH is the primary intermediate before HCHO can be completely oxidized into CO2, while the generation of CO is rare. It is found that the HCHO degradation efficiency is directly related to the activation energy of HCOOH transformation. By tailoring the binary channel reaction pathways and rate-determining step, highly enhanced degradation efficiency and elevated selectivity for complete mineralization are simultaneously realized. This work establishes a new method to investigate the reaction pathways for elevating the photocatalysis performance in volatile organic compounds degradation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Activation energy; Formaldehyde degradation; In situ DRIFTS; Photocatalysis; Reaction pathways","Carbon dioxide; Degradation; Formaldehyde; Formic acid; Indoor air pollution; Mineralogy; Photocatalysis; Photocatalytic activity; Volatile organic compounds; Decomposition efficiency; Degradation efficiency; Formaldehyde degradation; In-situ characterization; Rate determining step; Reaction pathways; Situ DRIFT; Theoretical approach; Activation energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071616809

However, this trend has been disrupted by the recent decommissioning and closure of a fleet of ageing coal power plants, along with the country's international commitments to reduce fossil fuel emissions. Currently, Australia is at a crucial stage of its transition to renewable energy adoption. With the purpose of providing an updated depiction of renewable energy, related policy and the way ahead in the Australian context, this research paper presents a systematic review of contemporary literature from the perspectives of energy potential, utilisation and policy incentives. The research analysed a total of 118 documents using an interpretivist epistemological lens; emergent findings offer an evidence-based, lucid account of advancements in the renewable energy market. Polynomial regression analysis is also conducted on secondary data obtained from the literature to predict trends in the electricity generated by different sources of renewable energy. The work also identifies several areas that require attention, including: (1) the most recent time-varying feed-in tariffs (TV FiTs) which offer the innate potential to alter consumer attitudes toward power usage at peak times, thereby improving grid security; (2) the increasingly popular integration of waste-to-energy with other sources of renewable energy emerges as a viable complementary solution to meet energy demands; (3) the increasing utilisation of subsidised geothermal energy installations which are set to rise exponentially in the future; and (4) the use of Public Private Partnerships (PPP) for developing renewable energy generation infrastructure and how this investment may facilitate the national transition to renewable energy adoption. This research contributes to the existing body of knowledge by raising awareness of the current state of renewable energy in Australia, along with proposing pragmatic recommendations for overcoming any challenges posed. As a comprehensive reference, this study provides practitioners and policymakers with thorough, reliable and collated information on Australia's current renewable energy position. © 2019","Feed-in tariffs (FiTs); Geothermal; Hydropower; Solar energy; Waste-to-energy; Wind energy","Electric power generation; Energy utilization; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Investments; Plant shutdowns; Regression analysis; Solar energy; Wind power; Feed-in tariff; Geothermal; Hydropower; Polynomial regression analysis; Public private partnerships; Renewable energy generation; Renewable energy markets; Waste to energy; Geothermal energy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072526043

SHDEs are represented by the probability-based index (PI), which considers precipitation and temperature anomalies. The results show that SHDEs over NEC increased from 1961 to 2005, and the experiments for historical forcing (ALL), increased greenhouse gases emission forcing (GHG), and anthropogenic forcing (ANT) can largely reproduce the spatial and temporal features of the trends of SHDEs over NEC. Based on the optimal fingerprinting method, the impact of increased anthropogenic activities can be detected at the 90% confidence level. In addition, the attributable changes of PI in response to GHG and ANT forcings resemble the observation, implying that the increasing trends of SHDEs over NEC are primarily attributed to the increased anthropogenic activity. Furthermore, the occurrence probability of SHDEs over NEC will be further increased under different Representative Concentration Pathways in the future. Additional strict control regulations on GHG emissions are thus suggested to mitigate its impact on regional climate changes. ©2020.

However, the highly selective generation of economically desirable products such as ethylene from the carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) remains a challenge2. Tuning the stabilities of intermediates to favour a desired reaction pathway can improve selectivity3–5, and this has recently been explored for the reaction on copper by controlling morphology6, grain boundaries7, facets8, oxidation state9 and dopants10. Unfortunately, the Faradaic efficiency for ethylene is still low in neutral media (60 per cent at a partial current density of 7 milliamperes per square centimetre in the best catalyst reported so far9), resulting in a low energy efficiency. Here we present a molecular tuning strategy—the functionalization of the surface of electrocatalysts with organic molecules—that stabilizes intermediates for more selective CO2RR to ethylene. Using electrochemical, operando/in situ spectroscopic and computational studies, we investigate the influence of a library of molecules, derived by electro-dimerization of arylpyridiniums11, adsorbed on copper. We find that the adhered molecules improve the stabilization of an ‘atop-bound’ CO intermediate (that is, an intermediate bound to a single copper atom), thereby favouring further reduction to ethylene. As a result of this strategy, we report the CO2RR to ethylene with a Faradaic efficiency of 72 per cent at a partial current density of 230 milliamperes per square centimetre in a liquid-electrolyte flow cell in a neutral medium. We report stable ethylene electrosynthesis for 190 hours in a system based on a membrane-electrode assembly that provides a full-cell energy efficiency of 20 per cent. We anticipate that this may be generalized to enable molecular strategies to complement heterogeneous catalysts by stabilizing intermediates through local molecular tuning. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon dioxide; copper; electrolyte solution; ethylene; pyridinium derivative; acetylene; carbon dioxide; energy efficiency; molecular analysis; renewable resource; Article; atom; catalyst; cell energy; chemical structure; current density; dimerization; electrochemical analysis; membrane stabilization; oxidation reduction reaction; priority journal; reaction diffusion model; spectroscopy; synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076789784

In this study, we utilize an open-source energy system optimization model and publicly available data sets to examine future electricity generation, CO2 emissions, and CO2 abatement costs for the North Carolina electric power sector through 2050. Model scenarios include uncertainty in future fuel prices, a hypothetical CO2 cap, and an extended renewable portfolio standard. Across the modeled scenarios, solar photovoltaics represent the most cost-effective low-carbon technology, while trade-offs among carbon constrained scenarios largely involve natural gas and renewables. We also develop a new method to calculate break-even costs, which indicate the capital costs at which specific technologies become cost-effective within the model. Significant variation in break-even costs are observed across different technologies and scenarios. We illustrate how break-even costs can be used to inform the development of an extended renewable portfolio standard in North Carolina. Utilizing the break-even costs to calibrate a tax credit for onshore wind, we find that the resultant wind deployment displaces other renewables, and thus has a negligible effect on CO2 emissions. Such insights can provide crucial guidance to policymakers weighing different policy options.

Countries and regions have unique circumstances when projecting energy transition pathways. Nonetheless, East Asian economies have shared opportunities and challenges. From the perspective of fuel mix, East Asia had some initial success in renewable energy development accompanied by energy efficiency improvements. Nuclear energy, although controversial, has been well developed and is continuing its advancement in East Asia. However, the dominance of coal in the energy mix has not been sufficiently addressed, mostly because of legacy issues. The region's renewable energy potential is also underdeveloped due to a mismatch between resources and energy demand. Since the region as whole is well endowed with renewable energy resources, the region's advancement in regional energy connectivity presents a valuable institutional asset to further decarbonize East Asian energy sector beyond individual nation's efforts.

This energy source in the Qiabuqia geothermal field of Northwest China is expected to generate electricity. In this study, we used the lab parameters and the GR1 well data from the Qiabuqia site to numerically investigate the reservoir stimulation and electricity generation from a three-horizontal-well EGS system created in the granitic reservoir at depth 3500–3700 m, and at an average temperature of 218 °C. Slickwater fracturing and the resulting reservoir scenarios for different expected conditions in the region were analyzed in order to find suitable fracturing strategies. We then proposed three optimized EGS scenarios and evaluated their economic and environmental benefits. Results indicate that EGS power generation significantly depends on the reservoir stimulation results. The potential 2.61–4.90 MW installed capacity and 433.72–913.05 GWh total power generation are expected to be realized if the well spacing of 300–500 m and the hot water circulation rate of 20–40 kg/s in a 20-year period are achieved via the slickwater fracturing treatment. The final production temperature can be maintained at approximately 200 °C, and the corresponding temperature drops less than 10%. Such a case of geothermal engineering is expected to result in a reduction in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of 0.15–1.1 Mt, and its levelized cost of energy (LCOE) is estimated at 0.047–0.066 $/kWh. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Enhanced geothermal system; Hot dry rock; Power generation; Qiabuqia geothermal field; Slickwater fracturing treatment","Cost engineering; Fracture; Gas emissions; Geothermal wells; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Horizontal wells; Hot dry rock systems; Power generation; Renewable energy resources; Well spacing; Well stimulation; Economic and environmental benefits; Electricity generation; Enhanced geothermal systems; Hot dry rock; Renewable energy source; Reservoir stimulations; Slickwater fracturing; Slickwater fracturing treatments; Space power generation; electricity generation; geothermal energy; geothermal gradient; geothermal power; geothermal system; hot dry rock; hydraulic fracturing; power generation; reservoir",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067821972

Therefore, establishing an efficient and distortion-free representation of spherical data is essential. This paper introduces a novel spherical (global) coordinate system that is free of singularity. Contrary to classical coordinates, such as Cartesian or spherical polar systems, the proposed coordinate system is naturally defined on the spherical surface. The basic idea of this coordinate system originated from the classical planar barycentric coordinates that describe the positions of points on a plane concerning the vertices of a given planar triangle; analogously, spherical area coordinates (SACs) describe the positions of points on a sphere concerning the vertices of a given spherical triangle. In particular, the global coordinate system is obtained by decomposing the globe into several identical triangular regions, constructing local coordinates for each region, and then combining them. Once the SACs have been established, the coordinate isolines form a new class of global grid systems. This kind of grid system has some useful properties: the grid cells exhaustively cover the globe without overlapping and have the same shape, and the grid system has a congruent hierarchical structure and simple relationship with traditional coordinates. These beneficial characteristics are suitable for organizing, representing, and analyzing spatial data. © 2020 by the authors.","Area coordinates; Spatial data; Spatial grids; Spherical framework",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079803567

Adaptation involves assessing potential climate-related risks and addressing these risks by implementing the appropriate changes in decision-making, operational activities and planning in response to observed or expected changes in climate. Governments, industry, individual citizens and community groups can all contribute by learning about and implementing adaptation measures to reduce potential harm and to take advantage of new opportunities. Possible adaptation actions are wide-ranging and may involve the use of new technologies, making adjustments to planning and investment practices, as well as reviewing and revising regulations where needed.

While industry and political interest in different carbon transition options is observable, decision-makers can be paralyzed by indecision due to challenges posed by conflicting policy targets, complexity of the regulatory environment as well as path dependence along institutional and socio-political dimensions. To support appraisal of the politics of a carbon transition in the chemical industry, a case analysis of the German chemical industry using three political indicators namely supply security, carbon pricing and regulatory framework is carried out. In addition to imported crude oil and natural gas, the case analysis evaluated biomass (biogas and wood waste), coal (bituminous coal and lignite), carbon dioxide and waste (municipal waste, sewage sludge and plastics) as alternative primary and secondary carbon feedstock for chemical production. The political indicators provided important quantitative and qualitative information of systemic impacts associated with different carbon feedstock options and supported a comparative overview of political drivers and obstacles, as well as trade-off challenges and uncertainties faced along the political dimension in promoting different carbon transition options for the German chemical industry. This study represents a first effort to illustrate and break down the complexity of the political dimension of a transformation in the chemical industry.

Meanwhile, agricultural production, serving as the primary stage of biobased products, is one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and nutrient releases. Environmental impacts of agricultural production influenced by farming practices, soil properties, and climate conditions, are often site-specific and time dependent. Although assessing spatially and temporally explicit environmental releases and impacts are required to inform a sustainable trajectory for agricultural production, such analyses are largely lacking. This study provides site-specific analysis of on-farm and supply chain emissions from corn production to demonstrate the spatio-temporal variability of environmental impacts in the U.S. Midwest states. Using process-based life cycle assessment (LCA) and the physically-based Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) agroecosystem model, we estimated county-level life cycle environmental release inventories from corn production in 12 U.S. Midwest states for the period of 2000–2008. Based on the Tool for Reduction and Assessment of Chemicals and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI) impact assessment model, we quantified the corresponding life cycle global warming (GW), eutrophication (EU) and acidification (AD) impacts of corn. The results show that life cycle GW, EU and AD of corn production varied by factors of 4.2, 83.7 and 10.6, respectively, across the Midwest counties over the nine-year span (2000–2008). Life cycle GW impacts of producing 1 kg of corn ranged from −6.4 in Franklin County, Illinois to 20.2 kg CO2-eq. in Perkins County, South Dakota. The life cycle EU impacts also spanned over a wide range of 0.99 g in Morton County, Kansas to 82.9 g N-eq. in Leelanau County, Michigan, whereas life cycle AD impacts ranged from 1.3 in Clermont County, Ohio to 100.7 g SO2-eq. in Perkins County, South Dakota. Moreover, trade-offs existed among life cycle GW, EU and AD impact categories for corn production. The spatial variation analyses showed that key contributors were the different soil types, precipitation, elevation and the amounts of fertilizers applied. These findings provided critical insight into spatio-temporal variations of life cycle environmental impacts of corn production and identified spatial hotspots and top contributors for improving environmental performances of corn production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Corn production; Environmental impacts; Environmental sustainability; Life cycle analysis; Spatiotemporal variability; US Midwest","Acidification; Agriculture; Chemical contamination; Climate models; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Eutrophication; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; International trade; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Corn production; Environmental performance; Environmental sustainability; Life cycle analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life-cycle environmental impact; Spatio-temporal variation; Spatiotemporal variability; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072289294

In cyanobacteria, a homologous protein (activase-like cyanobacterial protein, ALC), contains a distinctive C-terminal fusion resembling the small-subunit of rubisco. Although cyanobacterial rubisco is believed to be less sensitive to RuBP inhibition, the ALC is widely distributed among diverse cyanobacteria. Using microscopy, biochemistry and molecular biology, the cellular localization of the ALC, its effect on carboxysome/cell ultrastructure in Fremyella diplosiphon, and its function in vitro were studied. Bioinformatic analysis uncovered evolutionary relationships between the ALC and rubisco. ALC localizes to carboxysomes and exhibits ATPase activity. Furthermore, the ALC induces rubisco aggregation in a manner similar to that of another carboxysomal protein, M35, and this activity is affected by ATP. An alc deletion mutant showed modified cell morphology when grown under enriched CO2 and impaired regulation of carboxysome biogenesis, without affecting growth rate. Carbamylation of Fremyella recombinant rubisco was inhibited by RuBP, but this inhibition was not relieved by the ALC. The ALC does not appear to function like a canonical Rca; instead, it exerts an effect on the response to CO2 availability at the level of a metabolic module, the carboxysome, through rubisco network formation, and carboxysome organization. © 2019 The Authors.

These standards include the Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards promulgated by the U.S. Department of Transportation's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Light-Duty Vehicle GHG emissions standards promulgated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). They are known collectively-along with California's Advanced Clean Car program-as the National Program. NHTSA and EPA promulgated the second (current) phase of CAFE and GHG emissions standards affecting model year (MY) 2017-2025 light-duty vehicles on October 15, 2012. Like the initial phase of standards for MYs 2012-2016, the Phase 2 rulemaking was preceded by a multiparty agreement, brokered by the Obama White House. The agreement included the State of California, 13 auto manufacturers, and the United Auto Workers union. The manufacturers agreed to reduce GHG emissions from most new passenger cars, sport utility vehicles, vans, and pickup trucks by about 50% by 2025, compared to 2010, with fleet-wide fuel economy rising to nearly 50 miles per gallon. As part of the Phase 2 rulemaking, EPA and NHTSA made a commitment to conduct a midterm evaluation for the latter half of the standards (i.e., MYs 2022-2025, for which EPA had finalized requirements and NHTSA, due to statutory limits, had proposed ""augural"" requirements). On November 30, 2016, the Obama Administration's EPA released a proposed determination stating that the MY 2022-2025 standards remained appropriate and that a rulemaking to change them was not warranted. On January 12, 2017, EPA finalized the determination. After President Trump took office, however, EPA and NHTSA announced their joint intention to reconsider the Obama Administration's final determination and reopen the midterm evaluation process. EPA released a revised final determination on April 2, 2018. It stated the MY 2022-2025 standards were ""not appropriate and, therefore, should be revised,"" and that key assumptions in the January 2017 final determination-including gasoline prices, technology costs, and consumer acceptance-""were optimistic or have significantly changed."" With this revision, EPA and NHTSA announced that they would initiate a new rulemaking. Until that rulemaking is complete, the current standards would remain in force. On August 24, 2018, EPA and NHTSA proposed amendments to the existing CAFE and GHG emission standards. The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule for MY 2021-2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks offers eight alternatives. The agencies' preferred alternative, if finalized, is to retain the existing standards through MY 2020 and then to freeze the standards at this level for both programs through MY 2026. A final rule has not yet been released. In response to the proposals from the Trump Administration, California has restated its ""continued support for the current National Program and California's standards."" On December 12, 2018, California approved a regulatory amendment to clarify that automakers must still comply with the state's existing light-duty vehicle GHG standards through MY 2025-which includes standards in line with EPA's 2017 final determination and the 2012 rulemaking-even if EPA and NHTSA approve a rollback of the national rules. EPA granted California a Clean Air Act preemption waiver for its GHG standards on July 8, 2009. A number of issues remain forefront regarding the CAFE and GHG emission standards, their design, purpose, and potential revision. These include (1) whether EPA has adequately justified its decision to revise the MY 2022-2025 standards and (2) whether California can continue to implement state standards that would be more stringent than the revised federal ones.

Australia, as the first country to enact the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011, was sued by many cigarette companies. They consider Australia does not protect their interests as investors. While one of the reasons why Australia enforces these rules is to protect the environment, in this matter is public health of the society, and both are closely correlate with climate change. From this case, there is difference views between international investment law and environmental law. On the one hand, the principles of international investment law require protection of foreign investors, while the principles of environmental law require the states to provide an adequate protection on its environment. This research is a normative legal research. Data is secondary ones consisting of primary, secondary, and tertiary legal materials. Data collection techniques uses library research, while data analysis technique uses legal interpretation. The result of this study show that it is needed to establish a new approach in balancing between economic interest and public health one that can contribute to the climate change through drafting provision relating to the environmental issues in bilateral investment treaty (BIT). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Climate change; Economics; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Public health; Tobacco; Data analysis techniques; Data collection; Economic interests; Environmental issues; Environmental law; Foreign investors; International investments; Library research; Investments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081104649

To date, most studies of adaptation and resilience among Pacific island communities have used indicators and methods rooted in Western science and neo-classical economics. These have been criticized as being locally irrelevant and inadequate to appreciate the dynamic nature and social structures of island communities and their capacity to adapt. This paper challenges the paradigm that defines resilience as a return to equilibrium, by using a non-equilibrium, cultural ecological lens. The non-equilibrium view of resilience sees the social systems of island nations as highly dynamic and undergoing persistent adaptation in the face of changing environmental factors. Field-based research undertaken in eight villages in Samoa found that, through constant exposure to environmental change over extended periods of time, communities have become resilient and are in a position to adapt to future changes. In developing future policy in relation to climate change, Pacific island governments need to develop a more nuanced understanding of islanders’ perceptions and historical actions in the context of both their physical locations and their dynamic socio-cultural systems. © 2019 Department of Geography, National University of Singapore and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","adaptation; climate change; non-equilibrium; resilience; Samoa","adaptive management; climate change; environmental change; environmental factor; perception; policy development; regional climate; sea level change; Samoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074050107

For high performance, the catalyst nanoparticles must form charge-carrier-selective contacts with the underlying light-absorbing semiconductor, facilitating either hole or electron transfer while inhibiting collection of the opposite carrier. Despite the key role played by such selective contacts in photoelectrochemical energy conversion and storage, the underlying nanoscale interfaces are poorly understood because direct measurement of their properties is challenging, especially under operating conditions. Using an n-Si/Ni photoanode model system and potential-sensing atomic force microscopy, we measure interfacial electron-transfer processes and map the photovoltage generated during photoelectrochemical oxygen evolution at nanoscopic semiconductor/catalyst interfaces. We discover interfaces where the selectivity of low-Schottky-barrier n-Si/Ni contacts for holes is enhanced via a nanoscale size-dependent pinch-off effect produced when surrounding high-barrier regions develop during device operation. These results thus demonstrate (1) the ability to make nanoscale operando measurements of contact properties under practical photoelectrochemical conditions and (2) a design principle to control the flow of electrons and holes across semiconductor/catalyst junctions that is broadly relevant to different photoelectrochemical devices. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Atomic force microscopy; Carbon dioxide; Carbon films; Electron transitions; Energy conversion; Hydrogen fuels; Nanocatalysts; Nanoparticles; Pollution control; Schottky barrier diodes; Semiconductor junctions; Carbon dioxide reduction; Catalyst nano particles; Energy conversion and storages; Interfacial electron transfer; Nanoscale semiconductors; Photo-electrochemical device; Semiconductor structure; Semiconductor/catalyst junctions; Electrochemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076741060

However, the current stress that human populations are exerting on the planet has made it important to assess diets using environmental indicators, such as greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Therefore, the main objective of the current study was to propose a methodology in which Life Cycle Assessment results linked to dietary patterns in Peru were combined with nutritional and economic data to optimize diets. For this, a linear programming model was built in which the environmental, nutritional and economic information on a set of 25 dietary patterns in Peru were optimized in order to achieve the environmentally best-performing diet that complies with economic and nutritional standards. The result of the proposed linear program allowed understanding the amount of each individual food product that should be consumed in each city that satisfies all the restrictions included in the model in order to attain the lowest GHG emissions possible. Results demonstrated that GHG reductions in food diets can be attained through optimization. For instance, in the case of Lima the obtained reduction was 27%, lowering the annual per capita footprint linked to food diets to 690 kg CO2eq, as compared to the current value of 948 kg CO2eq. From an economic perspective, results show that there are important disparities between cities in terms of increasing or decreasing prices of the market basket. Considering that in most areas of the country food purchase accounts for approximately 50% of household expenditure, it is plausible to assume that food choice is a main carrier to achieve GHG emission mitigations. In this context, the method constitutes a useful tool for policy-makers to push forward joint regulations to improve health-related issues linked to the food diet and food choice together with recommendations to lower the climatic impact of diets. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Dietary patterns; GHG emissions; Industrial ecology; LCA; Peru","Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Life cycle; Linear programming; Dietary patterns; Environmental indicators; Environmental performance; GHG emission; Industrial ecology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Linear programming models; Peru; Nutrition; diet; emission; food consumption; greenhouse gas; industrial ecology; life cycle analysis; linear programing; optimization; article; carbon footprint; city; dietary pattern; ecology; household; human; life cycle assessment; Peru; system analysis; air pollution; catering service; diet; food; greenhouse gas; Peru; prevention and control; procedures; system analysis; Lima [Lima (DPR)]; Lima [Peru]; Peru; Air Pollution; Diet; Food; Food Supply; Greenhouse Gases; Humans; Peru; Programming, Linear",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074156747

Besides semi-inclusive particle production experiments, decays of the target nucleus via emission of neutrons provide an additional opportunity to probe this domain. This paper reports on the hybrid dynamical+statistical calculations of low-energy neutron production in muon-induced and virtual photon-induced collisions with nuclei. We confirm the conclusion that the E665 data on neutron production in μ- + Pb DIS at 470 GeV indicate a strong suppression of the final-state interaction for hadrons with momenta above ≈1 GeV/c. Ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) can be used to test this suppression. The calculations of the neutron multiplicity distributions and pt spectra in photon-nucleus collisions at the energies accessible at the LHC and RHIC are presented for several models of hadron formation. We argue that studies of neutron production in ultraperipheral heavy-ion collisions open a window onto the small-x dynamics and hadron component of the photon wave function. © 2020 authors.

The AMR approach provides increased resolution in localized regions based on user-defined criteria, resulting in a simulation that dynamically tracks fire spread and reduces computational cost compared to uniform and static mesh approaches. The new AMR-enabled solver, called diffusionFireFoam, is an extension of the fireFoam solver and incorporates dynamic meshing capabilities already available in OpenFOAM. We outline details of the new solver and demonstrate its basic functionality, accuracy, and computational efficiency for a small-scale methane pool fire verification case. We show that both first- and second-order statistics from the AMR simulation are in good agreement with results from a statically refined simulation that has the same fine-scale resolution, but a larger overall mesh. We then show for a larger-scale methane pool fire that an AMR simulation in diffusionFireFoam agrees with results from static mesh simulations, experiments, and prior computational studies. Once again, substantial computational savings are achieved, with roughly 5 times fewer grid cells in the AMR simulations than in prior static mesh simulations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive mesh refinement; Fire modeling; Large eddy simulation; OpenFOAM","Atmospheric turbulence; Computational efficiency; Diffusion; Fires; Large eddy simulation; Methane; Numerical analysis; Adaptive mesh refinement; Computational capability; Computational savings; Computational studies; Fire modeling; OpenFOAM; Second order statistics; Turbulent diffusion flame; Mesh generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077204230

Ambitions to ensure that new homes are built to ‘zero carbon’ standards have been expressed by policy makers but subsequent targets have been abandoned. In the UK housing sector, the high costs of land, the stagnating delivery of affordable new-built homes, and market dominance by a handful of high-volume housebuilders limit progress towards lower carbon newbuild homes. Against this backdrop, the paper seeks to examine the emergence of a supposedly ‘alternative’ sub-sector. Inspired by pioneering initiatives in countries like Germany and the Netherlands, a handful of self-build projects have emerged in the UK. Through the analysis of two in depth case studies, Bath street in Edinburgh and Graven Hill in Oxfordshire, we find that self-build projects can not only deliver more diverse and bespoke homes, but also more energy efficiency. Our analysis therefore unpicks their success stories vis-à-vis the inefficiencies of speculative house building where the adoption of national policies on zero carbon homes has been resisted. Framing the emergence of these self-build projects in the UK as social innovation, we identify the physical, conceptual and affective spaces for system change that are opened up by our case studies. We subsequently reflect on the key roles played by intermediaries, including local authorities, in the potential facilitation and mainstreaming of self-build approaches to delivering more energy efficient homes. © 2020 The Authors","Housing; Intermediaries; Local government; Sustainability; United Kingdom; Zero carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106433784

This study adopted a cross-sectional design and conducted a questionnaire survey of pharmacists working at three teaching hospitals (a district teaching hospital, a regional teaching hospital, and a medical center). Methods: The sampling criteria were a license to practice pharmacy and a willingness to sign a written consent form to participate in this study. Results: One hundred ten questionnaires were distributed, of which 101 contained valid responses, yielding a valid return rate of 91.82%. A significant correlation was evident between organizational climate, job stress, workplace burnout, and retention. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed that demographic variables, organizational climate, job stress, and workplace burnout had a predictive power of 55.6% for retention (F = 9.712***, P <.001). Organizational climate had a significant positive correlated with retention (β = 0.401*, P <.001). Conclusions: The results of this study can help hospitals to create a friendly and healthy workplace, instruct hospital managers how to improve their organizational climates, and reduce pharmacists’ job stress and workplace burnout, thereby enhancing the quality of pharmacy service and medication safety and eventually improving pharmacists’ intention to stay. © 2019 The Authors and Cathay General Hospital.

Lakes that contain dissolved ferrous iron in their deep waters (i.e., ferruginous) are rare, but valuable, as geochemical analogues of the conditions that dominated the Earth's oceans during the Precambrian when interactions between the iron and methane cycles could have shaped the greenhouse regulation of the planet's climate. Here, we explored controls on the methane fluxes from Brownie Lake and Canyon Lake, two ferruginous meromictic lakes that contain similar concentrations (max. >1 mM) of dissolved methane in their bottom waters. The order Methanobacteriales was the dominant methanogen detected in both lakes. At Brownie Lake, methanogen abundance, an increase in methane concentration with respect to depths closer to the sediment, and isotopic data suggest methanogenesis is an active process in the anoxic water column. At Canyon Lake, methanogenesis occurred primarily in the sediment. The most abundant aerobic methane-oxidizing bacteria present in both water columns were associated with the Gammaproteobacteria, with little evidence of anaerobic methane oxidizing organisms being present or active. Direct measurements at the surface revealed a methane flux from Brownie Lake that was two orders of magnitude greater than the flux from Canyon Lake. Comparison of measured versus calculated turbulent diffusive fluxes indicates that most of the methane flux at Brownie Lake was non-diffusive. Although the turbulent diffusive methane flux at Canyon Lake was attenuated by methane oxidizing bacteria, dissolved methane was detected in the epilimnion, suggestive of lateral transport of methane from littoral sediments. These results highlight the importance of direct measurements in estimating the total methane flux from water columns, and that non-diffusive transport of methane may be important to consider from other ferruginous systems. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","ferruginous; lakes; meromictic; methane flux","anoxic conditions; atmosphere-hydrosphere interaction; bacterium; biogeochemical cycle; bottom water; concentration (composition); detection method; flux measurement; geochemistry; meromictic lake; methane; methanogenesis; methanogenic bacterium; Precambrian; Lake Ransom Canyon; Texas; United States; Gammaproteobacteria; Methanobacteriales; Scomberomorus semifasciatus; iron; methane; atmosphere; lake; oxidation reduction reaction; Atmosphere; Iron; Lakes; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076480144

This research studies the effect of using calcined bentonite (CB) as partial replacement of Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) on the sustainability of self-compacting concrete (SCC). The cement in SCC mixes has been replaced with two different types of CB at 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30% by weight. Slump flow, V-funnel flow time, L-box test and sieve stability tests are performed to evaluate the fresh properties of SCC mixtures. Various tests are used to assess the performance of SCC mixtures in hardened states, such as compressive strength, porosity accessible to water, chloride-ions penetration and gas permeability. The results showed that the use of CB in SCC mixes reduced the fresh properties of SCC and the slump flows, flow times, and segregation tests are good enough for SCC production. At a hardened state, SCC with 10–15% of CB had a higher compressive strength up to 90 days, as well as improved porosity, chloride-ions penetration and gas permeability properties. These results indicate that a CB solution will reduce CO2 emissions and make durable and eco-friendly SCC at a low cost. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Calcined bentonite; Chloride-ions penetration; Durability; Fresh properties; Gas permeability; Porosity; Self-compacting concrete; Strength","Bentonite; Calcination; Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Chlorine compounds; Compressive strength; Concrete products; Cost engineering; Cost reduction; Durability; Environmental impact; Gas permeability; Hardening; Ions; Mixtures; Porosity; Portland cement; Sustainable development; Chloride ions; Durability property; Experimental investigations; Fresh properties; Ordinary Portland cement; Partial replacement; Permeability properties; Strength; Self compacting concrete",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072739133

Identifying geographical limits of current recommendations to emphasize the climate role in such events, we explore Brazilian framings of the two tragic national disasters, as apparent in newspaper coverage of climate change. We find that a variety of contextual factors compel environmental leaders and scientists in Brazil to avoid and discourage highlighting the role of climate change in national extreme events. Against analysts’ general deficit-finding assumptions, we argue that the Brazilian framing tendency reflects sound strategic, socio-environmental reasoning, and discuss circumstances in which attributing such events to climate change—and, by extension, attribution science—can be ineffective for policy action on climate change and other socio-environmental issues in need of public pressure and preventive action. The case study has implications beyond Brazil by begging greater attention to policies and politics in particular places before assuming that attribution science and discursive emphasis on the climate role in extreme events are the most strategic means of achieving climate mitigation and disaster preparedness.

This is a welcomed outcome considering that mitigation of climate disruption due to the use of fossil carbon is reaching a critical stage. However, the economy will remain dependent on carbon-based chemicals and the problem of electricity storage persists. Therefore, the development of electrosynthetic processes that convert electricity and CO2 into chemicals and energy dense fuels, perhaps even food, would be desirable. Electrochemistry has been applied to the manufacture of many valuable products and at a large industrial scale, but it is difficult to produce multicarbon chemicals from CO2 by chemistry alone. Being that the biological world possesses expertise at the construction of C-C bonds, it is being examined in conjunction with electrochemistry to discover new ways of synthesizing chemicals from electricity and CO2. One approach is microbial electrosynthesis.This Account describes the development of a microbial electrosynthesis system by the authors. A biocathode consisting of a carbon-based electrode and a microbial community produced short chain fatty acids, primarily acetate. The device works by electrolysis of water, but microbes facilitate electron transfer from the cathode while reducing CO2 by the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway possessed by an Acetobacterium sp. While this acetogenic microorganism dominates the microbiome growing on the cathode surface, 13 total species of microbes overall were ecologically selected on the cathode and genomes for each have been assembled. The combined species may contribute to the stability of the microbiome, a common feature of naturally selected microbial communities. The microbial electrosynthesis system was demonstrated to operate continuously at a cathode for more than 2 years and could also be used with intermittent power, thus demonstrating the stability of the microbiome living at the cathode. In addition to the description of reactor design and startup procedures, the possible mechanisms of electron transfer are described in this Account. While mysteries remain to be solved, much evidence indicates that the microbiome may facilitate electron transfer by supplying catalyst(s) external to the bacterial cells and onto the cathode surface. This may be in the form of a hydrogen-producing catalyst that enhances hydrogen generation by an inert carbon-based electrode.Through the enrichment of the electrosynthetic microbiome along with several modifications in reactor design and operation, the productivity and efficiency were improved. In addition to the intrinsic value of the current products, coupling the process with a secondary stage might be used to produce more valuable products from the acetic acid stream such as lipids, biocrude oil, or higher value food supplements. Alternatively, additional work on the mechanism of electron transfer, reactor design/operation, and modification of the microbes through synthetic biology, particularly to enhance carbon efficiency into higher value chemicals, are the needed next steps to advance microbial electrosynthesis so that it may be used to transform renewable electrons and CO2 directly into products and help solve the problem of climate disruption. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"carbon dioxide; organic compound; Acetobacterium; bioenergy; chemistry; electricity; electron transport; metabolism; microflora; Acetobacterium; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Carbon Dioxide; Electricity; Electron Transport; Microbiota; Organic Chemicals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078374275

Using the example of Brazil, this Opinion Article discusses the need to design LEDS that are in line with the national resource endowment and political economy constraints. Brazil is very rich in natural resources with a huge potential for renewable energy deployment. Developed countries can compensate the lack of a similar resource endowment with technological and financial resources, while poorer countries will need technological transfers and financial support from the international community. On the other hand, Brazil is an oil producer and will need to carefully navigate the reduction in oil demand, driven by a global trend toward transport electrification, in order to avoid stranded assets. The article also discusses the need to choose the right instruments to overcome the economic, financial, and noneconomic barriers to mitigation options and achieve an economically and socially sustainable transition to a low carbon society. LEDS can be designed in a way that minimizes economic and social impacts if they are accompanied by policies aiming at a gradual reduction of inequalities, including governmental transfers to keep substantial social development gains, energy, and food security. LEDS can leverage each country's competitiveness while protecting the poor, and they can be made politically acceptable. If such policies are implemented quickly enough across the world, then it may be not too late to stop dangerous climate change.

The Thermal And Near-infrared Sensor for carbon Observation Fourier-Transform Spectrometer (TANSO-FTS) onboard the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) launched in 2009 has demonstrated global grid observations of the total column density of CO2 and CH4 from space, and thus reduced uncertainty in the global flux estimation. In this paper, we present a case study on local CH4 emission detection from a single-point source using an available series of GOSAT data. By modifying the grid observation pattern, the pointing mechanism of TANSO-FTS targets a natural gas leak point at Aliso Canyon in Southern California, where the clear-sky frequency is high. To enhance local emission estimates, we retrieved CO2 and CH4 partial column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of the lower troposphere (XCO2 (LT) and XCH4 (LT)) by simultaneous use of both sunlight reflected from Earth's surface and thermal emissions from the atmosphere.

Requirement for charging infrastructure is one of the major parameters affecting the social acceptance of electric vehicles. Deployment of electric vehicles in countries, which relies primarily on fossil fuels for electricity generation, will only shift the emission threat from vehicle operation phase to energy generation phase. In this article a detailed study has been conducted on the posttreatment emission control strategies for diesel engines and conversion efficiency of platinum based diesel oxidation catalysis system has been investigated with experimental inference. Fossil fuel based energy sources have more than 70% share in electricity generation of India. Additionally, a feasibility study on the deployment of solar based electric vehicle charging stations on the roof of existing fuel stations in Dehradun city, India has been conducted. The results of study showed that the proposed PV system at 26 fuel stations have total energy generation capacity of 1.9 GWh.

Abstract: Color transition from juvenile green to dark purple leaf in Camellia sinensis is a complex process and thought to be regulated by an intricate balance of genes, proteins and metabolites expression. A molecular-level understanding of proteins and metabolites expression is needed to define metabolic process underpinning color transition in C. sinensis. Here, purple leaf growth of C. sinensis cultivar was divided into three developmental stages viz. juvenile green (JG), light purple (LP) and dark purple (DP) leaf. Scanning electron microscope (SEM) analysis revealed a clear morphological variation such as cell size, shape and texture as tea leaf undergoing color transition. Proteomic and metabolomic analyses displayed the temporal changes in proteins and metabolites that occur in color transition process. In total, 211 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were identified presumably involved in secondary metabolic processes particularly, flavonoids/anthocyanin biosynthesis, phytohormone regulation, carbon and nitrogen assimilation and photosynthesis, among others. Subcellular localization of three candidate proteins was further evaluated by their transient expression in planta. Interactome study revealed that proteins involved in primary metabolism, precursor metabolite, photosynthesis, phytohormones, transcription factor and anthocyanin biosynthesis were found to be interact directly or indirectly and thus, regulate color transition from JG to DP leaf. The present study not only corroborated earlier findings but also identified novel proteins and metabolites that putatively govern color transition in C. sinensis. These findings provide a platform for future studies that may be utilized for metabolic engineering/molecular breeding in an effort to develop more desirable traits. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Leaf; Metabolomics; Proteomics; Secondary metabolism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076457674

The major issues to design such type of WSNs are to reduce the power consumption of sensor nodes and enhance the life-time of nodes having limited battery capacity. In this paper, an energy-efficient transmission scheme in dynamic climatic conditions in WSNs has been proposed. This scheme is IEEE 802.15.4 standard adaptable. It considers two processes one is with feedback and another is without feedback. Process without feedback is used to evaluate and compensate the link quality due to effects of different climatic conditions such as temperature, rain, and snow (dry and wet), albeit process with feedback is used to divide the network into two logical regions to decrease the overhead of control packets.

The development of new renewable technologies is essential to improve the sustainability and to reduce emissions. The incorporation of phase change materials in buildings is an effective way to reduce the room temperature fluctuations and cooling loads/heating loads. Although several works have been carried out in this field, a novel phase change material clay hollow-brick composite has been used in this work. This article discusses the research on investigating the thermal performance of phase change material integration in building walls. Two identical test rooms (3 m × 3 m × 3.65 m) were constructed to study the effect of phase change material integration in buildings. The experimental buildings were constructed for the warm and humid weather conditions of Chennai city, India. Phase change material integration in the building wall is beneficial for reduction of room temperature and provides passive cooling of the building. The temperature drop in a phase change material room compared with a non-phase change material room varies from 6°C to 2°C, during various months of the year. DESIGNBUILDER simulation was carried out for phase change material and non-phase change material buildings during the months of January, March, May, and July.

In India, there have been continuous efforts to evolve a scientific basis for sustainable management of forests. In recent century, this has primarily been addressed through “forest management plans,” also known as “working plans.” To make the plans uniform for each of the forest management units, guidelines have been issued by Government of India in the name of “working plan code,”which are revised periodically to match present days’ requirement. A working plan largely deals with the present state of the forest, outcomes of past management, and proposal of future management on a scientific basis. With a significant lapse of time, the role of forests has been recognized beyond mere supply of timber (a major resource) to fulfilling the demands of minor resources and ecological services. This has transformed the basis of forest management and the working plans. With reference to India, we discuss the relevance of working plan for sustainable management of forests; highlights of the most recent working plan code (2014); relevance of the code with reference to climate change and biodiversity, future perspectives, and recommendations for better management of the forests. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis.","Climate change; forest inventory; forest management; working plan code","Biodiversity; Climate change; Sustainable development; Ecological services; Forest inventory; Forest management plans; Forest management units; Future perspectives; Government of India; Sustainable management; working plan code; Forestry; biodiversity; climate change; environmental planning; forest inventory; forest management; sustainability; Biodiversity; Forest Management; Forestry; Forests; India; Matches; Resources; Supply; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068368363

Yet, these ecosystems are threatened by intense land-use and governmental afforestation initiatives. They are vulnerable to woody encroachment due to fire suppression and climate change. Despite their ancient origins, Asian savannas have been misinterpreted as degraded forest since the colonial period. The consequences of this misinterpretation and climate change on ecosystem functions and diversity of savannas are highly uncertain. We used a dynamic vegetation model, the aDGVM2 to simulate vegetation state under different climate change scenarios to assess how different interpretations of simulated vegetation influence biome patterns in South Asia. Our results show that large areas in South Asia can be interpreted as woodland or degraded forest if we ignore the grassy component and as savanna if the grassy component is considered. The model projects woody encroachment in open savannas due to CO2-fertilization of woody plants and associated biome transitions towards forest by 2099. Our analysis shows that 23.7%–76.6% of the protected areas in the study region are at risk of change. Misclassifying grassy savannas as areas that are suitable for afforestation would lead to a 35–40% loss of these unique ecosystems. A grass-centric biome classification accounting for the grass component in addition to the woody component is necessary to correctly identify Asian savannas. We conclude that there is an urgent need for a correct interpretation of Asian savannas to allow sustainable management and conservation of biodiversity, which is already strongly threatened due to woody encroachment caused by climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","aDGVM2; Asian savanna; Biodiversity conservation; Climate change; CO2-fertilization; Degraded forest; Woody encroachment","afforestation; atmospheric deposition; biodiversity; biological invasion; biome; carbon dioxide enrichment; conservation planning; data interpretation; environmental degradation; environmental policy; forest ecosystem; savanna; woody plant; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075860665

This study has been performed to analyze the particulate matter (PM) emission from two different approaches i.e. on-site and off-site material preparation for resurfacing of asphalt road. The distribution of particle number concentration (PNC) in the microenvironments (MEs) around the activity and associated exposure to the workers were also studied. The total PM emission was calculated for both of the approaches by using non-road model and fixed emission factor of AP-42. The highly worker-dependent on-site practice has shown great concern compared to well-equipped off-site, due to high emissions at the pavement site. More contribution of PM at pavement site leads the significant presence of PNC in the working MEs around the activities. At the pavement site of on-site practices, 60% of worker’s were engaged within 25 m of fixed major activity MEs, where activities contribute 59.7% accumulation mode (0.5 µm) and 72.1% coarser mode (1 µm–10 µm) particle in total hourly measured PNC. This emission was 7.2 times to that of off-site practices where 53% of workers were engaged in major source activity (i.e. layering of asphalt). The average respiratory deposition dose in head airways (DFHA), tracheobronchial (DFTB), and alveolar (DFAL) regions were 2.3 × 107, 1.9 × 106 and 1.2 × 107 particles h−1, respectively. The results of the average total dose of deposition of particles were 2.1 times than that of the results of off-site practice. The research findings provide an understanding of particle distribution around pavement activity and health exposure of the worker’s.

We couple the bio-economic farm model FarmDyn and the crop system modelling framework SIMPLACE to assess the environmental and economic impact of the revised ordinance. The analysis focuses on specialized pig fattening and arable farms in the federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia. Most dominant farm types are derived from a farm typology based on the German Farm Structure Survey 2016. Following the revised ordinance, a farm type representing pig farms with a high stocking density lowers its emissions from 50 to 38 kg nitrate (NO3 −) nitrogen ha−1 and 18 to 8 kg ammonia (NH3) nitrogen ha−1 from manure application. Compliance costs are 2.32 Euro (€) pig−1 and are mainly caused by the need to export manure to meet the stricter nutrient surplus thresholds. A pig farm type with lower stocking density mainly adapts to the compulsory use of low-emission manure application techniques, resulting in almost constant NO3 − leaching, a NH3 reduction from manure application of 13 to 9 kg NH3- nitrogen ha−1, and compliance costs of 0.42 € pig−1. The two assessed arable farm types, which start to import manure under the revised ordinance, can lower costs by 109 and 118 € ha−1. However, manure import increases NO3 − leaching and NH3 volatilization. Our results show that intensive pig farms realize a high emission reduction and lose a relevant share of their standard gross margin when complying with the revised ordinance. However, farm types with low stocking density, representing a high share of the pig farms in the study area, show little or no changes in costs and emissions. These findings are relevant for efficient enforcement and targeted support measures. Furthermore, the import of manure on arable farms comprises the danger of regional pollution swapping, which policymakers should address by complementary measures. Future research should focus on improving the data base for crop modelling and on scaling-up the farm model to the regional scale to directly link emission changes and environmental targets. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"agricultural economics; agricultural modeling; agricultural production; coupling; fertilizer application; standard (regulation); Germany; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072261054

One of the largest waste generators include the commercial area, such as malls, restaurants, office buildings, motels, and others, which need to manage their wastes via more sustainable routes such as the application of these wastes as refuse derived fuel to mitigate the climate change causing by fossil fuel. This study aims to analyse the potential use of wastes generated from commercial areas such as refuse-derived fuel (RDF) in the cement industry for reducing CO2 emissions. Five variants of RDFs were developed on the basis of commercial solid waste compositions. Results revealed that RDF variation 3 comprising 20% paper and 80% plastics exhibits the highest energy of 6272 kcal/kg. As preliminary study, cement industry Y is investigated as an example.

It also examines the regional climate change projections based on the climate models used by the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) and national climate change modeling studies using the IITM Earth System Model (ESM) and CORDEX South Asia datasets. The IPCC assessment reports, published every 6-7 years, provide important reference material for major policy decisions on climate change, adaptation, and mitigation. While the IPCC assessment reports largely provide a global perspective on climate change, they offer limited information on the regional aspects of climate change. Regional climate change effects over the Indian subcontinent, especially relating to the Indian monsoon, are unique to the region, and in particular, the climate in this region is shaped by the Himalayas, Western Ghats, the Tibetan Plateau, the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea, and Bay of Bengal.

By sapping global demand for crude oil, climate action threatens the economic rents that underpin their governance and regime legitimacy. However, the Gulf states are also among the countries most exposed to physical risks of a warming climate and thus would benefit most from reducing ongoing accumulations of carbon in the atmosphere and associated adaptation costs. In other words, the political and economic risks of climate action run counter to the physical and environmental risks. These bifurcated interests differentiate the Gulf producers from oil exporters in more temperate regions, which would experience milder short-run damage—or even benefits—from a warming climate.

Aviation has come a long way since its inceptions and is regarded as the safest mode of transport; an achievement that has been built on accumulated experience. The incorporation of redundant systems is aimed at eliminating potential failure causes. Indeed, the introduction of sophisticated computers and cutting-edge technology has led to a decrease in accidents per se. The paper by J.A. Richter though suggests that the “safety-first” culture spearheaded by air carriers may be at risk. Market insighters claim that the aviation sector will continue to grow at a rate around 3% with the Asia-Pacific area showing the highest increase. The latter may be in part due to the introduction of policies that are fostering the role of market forces in the aviation industry. The paper by M. A. Abdullah et al using stochastic frontier analysis argues that production inefficiencies have occurred, which may be the outcome of global competition and suggest that air carriers ought to adjust to a more competitive international market. In anticipation of a constant rise in passenger numbers, aircraft manufacturers Boeing and Airbus have opted for different approaches in terms of meeting anticipated market demands. In doing so, Airbus introduced the double-decker A380 aircraft, with Emirates being its main customer followed by the leading European flag carriers. The marketing of the A380 has inadvertently affected airport service providers, Regulatory Bodies and Air carriers. As Greece is at the crossroads of Europe, Asia and the Middle East, author S. Topouris examines the possibility of the new Athens International Airport, AIA, to serve as an A380 scheduled airport. Athens International Airport is the successor of the former Hellinikon Airport, which terminated operations on March 28th, 2001, as it had reached its saturation point. Owing to Greece’s geographical particularities and the numerous scattered islands, aircraft and vessels are the primary modes of transport showing an increased trend. The study by P. Meimaris et al, provide preliminary data pertaining to the amount of emitted greenhouse gases, GHG, from civil aircraft flying within Hellenic Air Space, HAS. This work equally acknowledges the effect of wildfires in amplifying the percentage of GHGs within a region. Greece’s geostrategic location amidst the crossroads of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Middle-East is facilitating a higher amount of passenger and freight movements to a number of European metropolises. The cities of Athens and Piraeus act as European gateways for both air carriers and maritime companies, respectively. Acknowledging Europe’s White Paper on Transport, this work introduces a bold approach of minimizing greenhouse gases by turning part of Greece’s railway system into a high-speed network, which is deemed to augment its economy in the long-term. The work by V. M. Kafasis elaborates on the emerging opportunities in Greece’s aviation industry, resulting from the introduction of Law 4568/2018 pertaining to the licensing, operation and utilization of waterdromes. The development and operation of seaplanes is expected to offer a flexible alternative, which, in turn, may foster inter-connectivity and enhance remote area accessibility, while improving financial performance indicators. The successive European Air Liberalisation Acts inadvertently affected a number of European flag carriers. The 2008 financial crisis that spread across Europe had a profound impact on Cypriot Economy, in particular during the (2011-2012) period. Author C.

While a growing academic literature analyzes this problem, perceptions of which obstacles inhibit goal attainment and which responses might be most effective seem to differ widely. This makes prioritization and agreement on the way forward difficult. To inform prioritization in global climate policy and research agendas, we present quantitative data on how 917 experts from the IPCC and the UNFCCC perceive the importance of different obstacles and response options for achieving 2 °C. On average, respondents consider opposition from special interest groups the most important obstacle and technological R&D the most important response. Our survey also finds that the majority of experts perceives a wide range of issues as important, supporting an agenda that is inclusive in terms of coverage. Average importance ratings differ between experts from the Global North and South, suggesting that balanced representation in global fora and regionally differentiated agendas are important. In particular, opposition from special interest groups is a top priority among experts from North America, Europe and Oceania. Investigating the drivers of individual importance ratings, we find little difference between experts from the IPCC and the UNFCCC, while expert's perceptions correlate with their academic training and their national scientific, regulatory, and financial contexts. © 2020 The Author(s).

Existing data sources to estimate energy costs are limited to surveys with small samples and low spatial and temporal resolution, such as the American Housing Survey and the Residential Energy Consumption Survey. In this study, we present a new method for small-area estimates of household energy cost burdens (ECBs) that leverages actual building energy use data for approximately 13,000 multifamily properties across five U.S. cities and links energy costs to savings opportunities by analyzing 3,000 energy audit reports. We examine differentials in cost burdens across household demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and analyze spatial, regional, and building-level variations in energy use and expenditures. Our results show the average low-income household has an ECB of 7%, whereas higher income households have an average burden of 2%. Notably, even within defined income bands, minority households experience higher ECBs than non-Hispanic White households. For lower income households, low-cost energy improvements could reduce energy costs by as much as $1,500 per year. Takeaway for practice: In this study we attempt to shift the focus of energy efficiency investments to their impact on household cost burdens and overall housing affordability. Our analysis explores new and unique data generated from measurement-driven urban energy policies and shows low-income households disproportionately bear the burden of poor-quality and energy-inefficient housing. Cities can use these new data resources and methods to develop equity-based energy policies that treat energy efficiency and climate mitigation as issues of environmental justice and that apply data-driven, targeted policies to improve quality of life for the most vulnerable urban residents. © 2019, © 2019 American Planning Association, Chicago, IL.","big data; energy cost burden; energy efficiency; environmental justice; housing affordability","affordable housing; benchmarking; cost analysis; energy efficiency; energy policy; environmental justice; household energy; low income population; quality of life; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073836674

However, the methods for the determination of platinum group metals in environmental matrices are either costly or suffer from low sensitivity. To facilitate the use of less sensitive, but significantly cheaper, devices, the preconcentration of platinum group metals is employed. For platinum, a multitude of preconcentration approaches have been published. On the contrary, the preconcentration approaches for palladium are still rare. In this work, the development, optimization, and testing of a new approach is described; it is based on a preconcentration of palladium on octadecyl modified silica gel together with the complexing agent dimethylglyoxime, and it is then analyzed with the high-resolution continuum-source atomic absorption spectrometry. For comparison, a newly developed sorbent, QuadraSil™ TA, with a high affinity for platinum group metals was also tested. The preconcentraiton approach was tested on the lichen Hypogymnia physodes, which served as a bioindicator of palladium emissions. The case study site was a mid-sized city in central Europe: Brno, Czech Republic. The dry “bag” monitoring technique was used to collect the palladium near roads with a large span of traffic density. The developed analytical approach confirmed an increasing concentration of palladium with increasing exposure time and intensity of the traffic. Consequently, a simple relationship between the amount of bioaccumulated palladium and traffic density was established.

The work will also be of interest in the motorsport sector to improve performance and also some applications within the aerospace and renewable energy sectors. The wind tunnel testing of a spring-mounted symmetrical NACA 0012 wing in freestream is studied over 0° to 40° angles of incidence. General operation of the concept is verified at low angles in the pre-stall region with that of a theoretical estimation using finite and infinite wings. Three distinct regions are identified, pre-stall, near-stall, and post-stall. The transient limitations associated in the near-stall region with variations in spring loading and flow velocities are discovered. It is identified as a periodic self-sustained oscillation with nondimensional reduced frequencies in the range from 0.14 to 0.22. Furthermore, performance in the post-stall region along with pre-stall is reported, and methods for the adjustment of the elastic element for a desired response are introduced. Evaluation is conducted with regard to an automotive application such as a rear wing on a high-downforce race car. Typically a 25% increase in wind velocity in the pre-stall region results in a 3° to 5° change in angle of incidence corresponding to a 25-40% reduction of drag coefficient depending on spring stiffness. Reductions of 20° in angle of incidence with similar 25% increase in wind velocity are typically found in the post-stall region. Even larger reductions are found when transitioning through the stall region. This work provides a valuable insight for a novel concept, but we only recommend its use in the pre-stall region to achieve steady results. Use at higher angles is only recommended if transient effects are not important. Limitations to this proof of concept work are highlighted and future development work is suggested to achieve further increases in performance. © 2020 SAE International.","Aerodynamic optimization; Drag reduction; Fluid-structure interaction; NACA 0012; Stability","Automotive industry; Drag; Fluid structure interaction; Rigid structures; Springs (components); Velocity; Wind; Wind tunnels; Angle of Incidence; Angles of incidence; Automotive applications; Improve performance; Renewable energy sector; Self-sustained oscillations; Theoretical estimation; Wind-tunnel testing; Rigid wings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084183232

Here, a case of PCA involving prominent visual perceptual disorders is reported; PCA was difficult to distinguish from psychogenic disturbance of vision in this case. For a year, a 59-year-old woman had had visual perceptual disorders, including a distorted view and prosopagnosia. She underwent examinations at multiple clinical departments at several medical institutions before receiving a definitive diagnosis of PCA. This PCA diagnosis was based on clinical symptoms, including Gerstmann syndrome, Bálint's syndrome, and transcortical sensory aphasia, and hypoperfusion in the occipital lobe observed on single-photon emission computed tomography. This case was initially misdiagnosed as a psychogenic disease partly because characteristic clinical manifestations of PCA include visual agnosia with a disjunctive component. This patient displayed a disordered perception of stationary objects but an intact perception of moving objects. For example, she had to grope her way through a room at home, but she could visit a familiar hair salon on foot without hindrance. Behaviours like claiming to be blind while inexplicably moving without colliding with surrounding objects may lead to the misdiagnosis of PCA as a psychogenic or dissociative disorder involving histrionic or neurologically irrational symptoms with an expectation of sympathy or personal gain. It is critical to make every effort to exclude organic diseases, even in cases provisionally diagnosed as psychogenic disease. Despite its low prevalence, PCA should be considered a syndrome caused by Alzheimer's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, or other dementias. © 2019 The Author Psychogeriatrics published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd on behalf of Japanese Psychogeriatric Society","Bálint's syndrome; dementia with Lewy bodies; Gerstmann syndrome; posterior cortical atrophy","donepezil; ethyl loflazepate; fluvoxamine; tau protein; yokukansan; ADL disability; adult; agnosia; anxiety disorder; Article; ataxia; Balint syndrome; brain cortex atrophy; brain perfusion; Capgras syndrome; case report; clinical article; clinical evaluation; cognitive defect; cortical sensory aphasia; diagnostic error; differential diagnosis; disease association; disease exacerbation; disease severity; disorders of higher cerebral function; dissociative disorder; facial recognition; female; fluency disorder; gaze paralysis; Gerstmann syndrome; human; human relation; immobility; jealous delusion; job stress; language disability; memory disorder; middle aged; Mini Mental State Examination; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; occipital lobe; ophthalmology; optic ataxia; paranoia; patient attitude; persecutory delusion; priority journal; prosopagnosia; psychotherapy; single photon emission computed tomography; somatoform disorder; spatial behavior; visual disorder; atrophy; complication; diagnostic imaging; differential diagnosis; pathology; perception disorder; Agnosia; Aphasia, Wernicke; Atrophy; Diagnosis, Differential; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Occipital Lobe; Perceptual Disorders; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064692714

Via accelerated weathering of limestone (AWL), CO2 can be captured from effluent gas streams and stored in the marine environment primarily in the form of bicarbonate. We studied the CO2 storage capacity and how AWL-derived water impacts the carbonate chemistry of the southern North Sea. Therefor, a three-dimensional hydrodynamic model was coupled with a sub-module to model the carbonate chemistry. We studied three scenarios: 1) scrubbing effluent gas streams of a combined heat and power plant (60 kW), 2) scrubbing 10 % or 3) 100 % of the flue gas of a coal-fired power plant (750 MW). Whereas, impacts on seawater carbonate chemistry due to AWL discharge were imperceptible in the first scenario, a maximum change in pHT and calcite saturation state of 0.1 and 0.6 was found in scenario 2. In scenario 3, the decrease in pHT exceeded 1 around the discharge site and the calcite saturation state reached 8 in large parts of the Jade Bay, posing the possibility of significant impacts on the marine ecosystem. Abiotic precipitation of calcite might occur around the discharge site. In all three scenarios, 50 % of the captured CO2 re-entered the atmosphere after the simulated time period of one year. This study shows that care is needed in siting, sizing and operating AWL facilities to maximize climate and ocean ecosystem benefits while minimizing negative environmental impacts. © 2019 The Authors","Carbon capture and utilization; CCS; CO2 mitigation; FVCOM; Ocean acidification","Calcite; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Coal; Cogeneration plants; Ecosystems; Effluents; Fossil fuel power plants; Lime; Limestone; Silicate minerals; Weathering; Accelerated weathering; CO2 mitigation; Coal-fired power plant; FVCOM; Industrial revolutions; Ocean acidifications; Southern North Sea; Three-dimensional hydrodynamic modeling; Carbon capture; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbonate; hydrodynamics; limestone; modeling; ocean acidification; weathering; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075163634

However, different model experiments1–3 have been used in these analyses under varying rates of increase in global-average temperature. Here, we use climate model simulations to show that, for a given global temperature, most land is significantly warmer in a rapidly warming (transient) case than in a quasi-equilibrium climate. This results in more than 90% of the world’s population experiencing a warmer local climate under transient global warming than equilibrium global warming. Relative to differences between the 1.5 °C and 2 °C global warming limits, the differences between transient and quasi-equilibrium states are substantial. For many land regions, the probability of very warm seasons is at least two times greater in a transient climate than in a quasi-equilibrium equivalent. In developing regions, there are sizable differences between transient and quasi-equilibrium climates that underline the importance of explicitly framing projections. Our study highlights the need to better understand differences between future climates under rapid warming and quasi-equilibrium conditions for the development of climate change adaptation policies.

Neuromorphic parallel processing can be implemented naturally using the crossbar geometry of synaptic device arrays with Ohm's and Kirchhoff's laws. However, selective and parallel weight updates of the synaptic crossbar array are still very challenging due to the unavoidable crosstalk between adjacent devices and sneak path currents. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a weight update protocol in a carbon nanotube synaptic transistor array, where selective and parallel weight updates can be executed by exploiting the individually controllable three terminals of the synaptic device via a localized carrier trapping mechanism. The trained 9 × 8 synaptic array solves four different convolution operations simultaneously for the feature extraction of an image. The massive parallelism and robustness of the weight update protocol are important features toward effective manipulation of big data through neuromorphic computing systems. © 2020 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Neural networks; Important features; Localized carriers; Massive parallelism; Massively parallel processing; Neumann architecture; Neuromorphic computing; Parallel processing; Transistor arrays; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078377576

Here, we analyze fire activity and relevant large-scale atmospheric conditions over southeastern Siberia, which has the largest burned area fraction in the circumboreal and high-level carbon emissions due to high-density peatlands. It is found that the annual burned area increased when a positive Arctic Oscillation (AO) takes place in early months of the year, despite peak fire season occurring 1 to 2 months later. A local high-pressure system linked to the AO drives a high-temperature anomaly in late winter, causing premature snowmelt. This causes earlier ground surface exposure and drier ground in spring due to enhanced evaporation, promoting fire spreading. Recently, southeastern Siberia has experienced warming and snow retreat; therefore, southeastern Siberia requires appropriate fire management strategies to prevent massive carbon release and accelerated global warming.

It is a proven, mature, predictable, and price-competitive technology. Hydropower has among the best conversion efficiencies of all known energy sources (about 90% efficiency, water to wire). It requires relatively high initial investment, but has a long life span with very low operation and maintenance costs. The existing hydropower system has an annual generation capacity of 4100 TWh a-1 and contributes to almost 17% of the annual electricity generation, worldwide. There is still a large potential for further development, as the total technical potential has been estimated to be roughly 16, 000 TWh. Out of this, about 9600 TWh has been classified as economical potential. In Europe, close to 50% of technical potential has already been developed, while in Asia 24% and in Africa only 6%. Significant potential can also be found in existing infrastructure that currently lacks generating units (e.g., existing barrages, weirs, dams, canal fall structures, water supply schemes) by adding new hydropower facilities. Only 25% of the existing 45, 000 large dams in the world are currently used for hydropower, and the other 75% are used exclusively for other purposes (e.g., irrigation, flood control, navigation, and urban water supply schemes). Hydropower offers significant potential for carbon emissions reductions, as greenhouse gas emissions are generally very low, typically less than 1% of that from coal power plants. Hydropower is cost competitive, with LCOE typically in the range of 2-10 US c.(kWh)-1, which is comparable with the cost of energy from thermal power plants. Hydropower has an energy payback ratio of 200-300, highest of all types of renewable energies. Hydropower can provide both energy and water management services and also help to support other variable renewable energy sources such as wind and solar, by providing storage and load balancing services. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

In this regard, exploiting the organic fraction of municipal solid waste (OFMSW) for producing high value bioproducts and bioenergy under a biorefinery approach has attracted great interest. This paper presents the state of the art of urban biowaste biorefinery concepts. Accordingly, different novel valorization pathways, namely single cell protein, biosuccinic acid, and lactic acid, as well as bioenergy production were consolidated into some scenarios. Moreover, successfully tested hydrogen-assisted biological biogas upgrading was also incorporated into some scenarios as energy source for methanotrophs to upcycle nitrogen rich digestate into single cell protein. Upon the successful lab-scale experiments, different biorefinery platforms were developed and their sustainability was environmentally scrutinized using consequential life cycle assessment. The results obtained herein demonstrated that despite having different net environmental benefits, all the developed scenarios were eco-friendly solutions for valorizing biowaste into bioproducts and bioenergy. Scenarios including microbial protein production led to a saving of −58 to −147 kg CO2,eq/t biopulp in Climate change category, depending on the biorefining pathway. The net saving in Climate change category achieved for Succinic acid- and Lactic acid-based biorefinery was estimated at −73 and −173 kg CO2,eq/t biopulp, respectively. Biological biogas upgrading, if implemented, could increase energy payback by 9724 MJ/t biopulp and contribute more to the sustainability of other developed scenarios. Although scenarios with the main focus on bioenergy production outperformed others in terms of environmental sustainability, some complementary factors such as policy decisions, energy directives, economic issues, and carbon trade schemes must be taken into account in order to introduce the best valorization pathway. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biorefinery; Circular bioeconomy; Lactic acid; Municipal solid waste; Single cell protein; Succinic acid","Bioconversion; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Environmental protection; Fossil fuel deposits; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Lactic acid; Life cycle; Proteins; Refining; Sustainable development; Biorefineries; Circular bioeconomy; Consequential life-cycle assessment; Environmental life cycle assessment; Environmental sustainability; Organic fraction of municipal solid wastes; Single cell proteins; Succinic acids; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073688140

A targeted approach to address this gap can be useful in developing a women-responsive climatic risk management plan focused on reducing their labor burden in agriculture, especially in areas with high climate risks. The paper therefore presents a top–down approach to identify potential labor-saving CSA technologies for women farmers in areas facing high climate risks. It involves mapping women in agriculture, climate risks, and poverty hotspots and entails understanding the role of women in agricultural activities to identify the suitable CSA options for reducing the levels of labor drudgery. The study is illustrated for Nepal where feminization of agriculture is rapidly increasing, a high level of climatic risks persists, and adaptive capacity to climate change is very low, especially among women in agriculture. Results are presented for two hotspot districts, Rupandehi and Chitwan. Household socioeconomic characteristics were found to play a major role in women’s labor contribution in different crop production activities. Discussions with farmers provided a list of more than 15 CSA interventions with labor reduction as well as yield-improving potential. Accordingly, considering the local crop, agro-climate, and social conditions, and women’s participation in different agricultural activities, CSA technologies and practices such as direct seeded rice (zero tillage and low tillage using machine), green manuring (GM), laser land leveling (LLL), and system of rice intensification (SRI) were found to potentially reduce women’s drudgery in agriculture along with improvement in productivity and farm income. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Crops; Cultivation; Manures; Risk management; Adaptive capacity; Agricultural activities; Climatic risks; Crop production; Smart agricultures; Social conditions; Socioeconomic characteristics; System of rice intensifications; Climate change; agrometeorology; climate effect; crop production; feminization; green manuring; income distribution; labor participation; laser method; poverty; rice; tillage; womens status; Chitwan; Lumbini; Narayani; Nepal; Rupandehi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060171594

During the present investigation, herbaceous vegetation were studied in east, west, north and south directions of Ambikapur township at various seasons during March 2017 to April 2018. A total of 18 species representing 11 families were recorded at various directions of Ambikapur township in different seasons. Asteraceae was the predominant family in the study area. Highest species counts were recorded during summer season. Among the herbaceous vegetation, more than two-thirds of the herb species were exotic in nature, revealing the anthropogenic role towards loss of indigenous species. Highest species density was recorded in north direction (152,000 herb/ha during rainy, 104,000 herb/ha in winter and 184,000 herb/ha in summer) and lowest in south direction (90,000 herb/ha during rainy, 72,000 herb/ha in winter and 88,000 herb/ha in summer) in all seasons. Higher Shannon diversity (2.71 in rainy, 2.69 in winter and 3.07 in summer) and richness (0.67 in rainy, 0.52 in winter and 0.66 in summer after west direction) were recorded in the north direction. Total biomass, C storage and CO2 mitigation were found to be highest towards north direction in all seasons. Argemone mexicana, Cassia tora, Ocimum tenuiflorum and Sida acuata are the most suitable species in terms of C storage, CO2 mitigation under urban setup. Beside, some weed species also reflected significant potential. CO2 mitigation by herb species can act as complimentary system towards climate cane adaptation beside other vegetal layers.

Research to date exhibits its favorable physico-chemical characteristics, viz. greater porosity, surface area, amount of functional groups, and cation exchange capacity (CEC), which allow interface with main nutrient cycles, favor microbial activities during composting, and improve the reproduction of earthworms during vermicomposting. Biochar amendment during composting and vermicomposting of biowastes boosts physico-chemical properties of compost mixture, microbial activities and organic matter degradation; and reduces nitrogen loss and emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs). It also improves the quality of final compost by increasing concentration of plant available nutrients, enhancing maturity, decreasing composting duration and reducing the toxicity of compost. Due to these characteristics, biochar could be considered a beneficial additive for the stabilization of different biowastes during composting and vermicomposting processes. Hence, good quality vermicompost, efficient recycling and management of biowastes could be achieved by addition of biochar through composting and vermicomposting. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; Biowastes; Nutrient retention; Nutrient rich compost; Vermicomposting","Cell proliferation; Greenhouse gases; Nutrients; Stabilization; Bio chars; Biowastes; Cation exchange capacities; Nutrient retention; Organic matter degradations; Physicochemical characteristics; Plant-available nutrients; Vermi-composting; Composting; biochar; charcoal; heavy metal; nitrogen; organic matter; unclassified drug; biochar; charcoal; nitrogen; biochar; cation exchange capacity; composting; divergence; greenhouse gas; literature review; microbial activity; organic matter; recycling; research work; soil stabilization; stabilization; vermiculture; Article; biodegradation; cation exchange; concentration (parameter); cost benefit analysis; enzyme activity; greenhouse gas; microbial activity; microbial community; nonhuman; nutrient availability; nutrient cycle; physical chemistry; porosity; surface area; vermicompost; waste management; animal; chemistry; composting; humic substance; microbiology; Oligochaeta; procedures; soil; solid waste; Animals; Charcoal; Composting; Humic Substances; Nitrogen; Oligochaeta; Soil; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071554553

Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional descriptive study, 17 sampling points in Karaj city were chosen using GIS software. Sampling of PM2.5was carried out for 24 h using the sampling pilot during the four seasons in the air of Karaj city. Sampling of PM2.5was performed using PTFE filters, peripheral pump, and personal modular impactor. The concentration of particles collected on the filter was calculated by gravimetric method. Meteorological parameters including temperature, humidity, pressure, cloud coverage rate, ultraviolet (UV), and dew point were recorded during sampling through portable devices. Finally, the relationship between PM2.5concentration and meteorological parameters was assessed by SPSS24 and Excel software. Results: Seasonal variation trends of PM2.5particles showed that maximum and minimum annual concentrations have happened in autumn and spring seasons with a value of 67.48 and 19.85 μg/m3, respectively. Furthermore, the citizens of Karaj are exposed to PM2.5pollutants four times more than the Environmental Protection Agency-recommended standard (10 μg/m3). The findings of this study also show that there is a positive correlation between PM2.5particle concentration and temperature, relative humidity, and pressure (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, a weak and negative correlation was found between UV radiation, cloud cover, and dew point with PM2.5particle concentration (P &gt; 0.05). Conclusion: The highest concentrations of particles were observed in autumn season. Furthermore, the particle concentration scatter map shows that the central and eastern regions and north of Karaj are more polluted than other areas. Therefore, to protect the health of citizens of Karaj, appropriate policies and strategies should be adopted to reduce the concentration of particulate matter and other pollutants in the ambient air of this city. © 2020 American Institute of Physics Inc..

With some exception of date (fruit), first-generation ethanol production triggers food vs. fuel debates in Iran and put nation to hunger. Agricultural products including apple, barley, carrot, corn, grape, orange, potato, rice, sugar beet, sugarcane, and wheat are consumed domestically, exported, or even lost because of poor harvesting and processing conditions such as transportation or packaging. These products may alone generate 21.56 million ton per annum green wastes upon processing in the food industry. Every year about 5.4 billion liters of bioethanol can be produced by establishing second-generation ethanol plants next to the food processing sectors. Seventy-seven-percent of this amount of bioethanol can easily support 5% ethanol (E5) policy to phase out the consumption of 4.2 billion liters methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) for raising the octane number of gasoline in the country. If more comprehensive policy is adopted, larger quantities of lignocellulosic feedstocks can be gathered from agro as well as forestry practices. Second-generation bioethanol technology can help Iran to tackle air pollution in its big cities and to address the adverse effects of MTBE on its populations and ecosystem. The other advantages are improvement of fuel security, mitigation of climate change, and development of economy. The motivation can be created through passing a framework policy to cut fossil fuel subsidies, to mandate bioethanol blends in gasoline, and to impose carbon taxes. Development of coherent socially and environmentally relevant strategies and facilitation of investment in bioethanol industry are also necessary. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Fermentation; Greenhouse gas; Hydrolysis; Lignocellulose; Liquid biofuel; Pretreatment","Agricultural robots; Biomass; Climate change; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy policy; Ethanol; Fermentation; Food processing; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Gasoline; Green manufacturing; Greenhouse gases; Hydrolysis; Lignocellulosic biomass; Molasses; Sugar beets; Sugar industry; Agricultural industries; Bio-ethanol production; Lignocellulose; Lignocellulosic feedstocks; Liquid biofuels; Methyl tert butyl ether; Pre-Treatment; Second generation bioethanol; Bioethanol; additive; agroindustry; biofuel; cellulose; crop residue; fermentation; greenhouse gas; hydrolysis; lignin; waste treatment; Brazil; Iran; United States; Beta vulgaris subsp. vulgaris; Daucus carota; Hordeum; Malus x domestica; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum; Vitaceae; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067560193

We performed a prospective observational study (GUNMA0702) to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of carbon ion radiotherapy for localized and locally advanced prostate cancer. Methods: Between June 2010 and August 2013, 304 patients with localized prostate cancer were treated, with a median follow-up duration of 60 months. All patients received carbon ion radiotherapy with 57.6 Gy (RBE) in 16 fractions over 4 weeks. Hormonal therapy was given according to the risk group. Toxicity was reported according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Event, Version 4.0 by the National Cancer Institute. Results: The overall 5-year biochemical relapse-free rate was 92.7%, with rates of 91.7, 93.4, and 92.0% in low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk patients, respectively. The 5-year local control and overall survival rates were 98.4 and 96.6%, respectively. Acute grade 3 or greater toxicity was not observed. Late grade 2 and grade 3 genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity rates were 9 and 0.3%, and 0.3, and 0%, respectively. Conclusions: The present protocol of carbon ion radiotherapy for prostate cancer provided low genitourinary and gastrointestinal toxicity with good biochemical control within 5 years.

The core, ExT based on a fused cyclic trimer of indenofluorene, was found to be planar in nature and a potential precursor for blue emission. This could be selectively brominated under mild conditions to generate a tribromo derivative which underwent ready Suzuki coupling to generate a trisubstituted pyrene derivative, ExT-P. This coupling alters the kinetics of the excited state considerably as evident from transient absorption spectroscopy, showing faster singlet state decay and less triplet state formation in the case of the pyrene coupled ExT-P (∼1.6 ns) compared to ExT (∼17 ns). The ExT-P shows emission maxima at 441 nm and 442 nm in THF solution and film, respectively, with high PLQY value of 0.97. The negligible bathochromic shift in the solid-state emission and narrow FWHM suggests practically no aggregation and pure blue emission in the target molecule due to bulky and rigid core. © 2020 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Currently, only high-level aggregated data at the sectoral and regional levels exists in the literature. Through bottom-up energy demand tree development, we identified end-use processes for each mining operation in these sectors. The energy intensities for each end-user were calculated and used in a bottom-up energy-environmental model to determine the associated end-use process GHG emissions. The results were then used to develop Sankey diagrams that allow us to visualize the energy and GHG emissions flows from resource to end use by energy use sector, fuel type, and various jurisdictions in Canada. The overall energy and GHG emission intensities for iron, gold, and potash mining are 0.7, 149.8, 1.8 GJ/Mg and 33, 4922, 158 kg CO2 eq./Mg, respectively. Firing, ventilation, and product drying and steam generation end-use devices had the highest energy use share of 42%, 20%, and 47% in iron, gold, and potash mining sectors, respectively, in 2016. Firing in iron mining, ore transport in gold mining, and product drying and steam generation in potash mining were responsible for 66%, 22%, and 34% of the respective total sectoral GHG emissions. 56% of the GHG emissions were from Saskatchewan, followed by Quebec (18%), and Newfoundland and Labrador (14%).

Studying adaptation not only assists in knowing how farmers are dealing with the repercussions of climate change, but also provides the baseline for the planned interventions which are essential in this era of human-instigated climate change. We used case study data to examine whether and how subsistence-oriented smallholder farmers in three agro-ecological zones of Nepal (Terai, Hill, and Mountain) are developing and implementing adaptation strategies. The findings from small farm household interviews (n = 384), key informant interviews (n = 33), and focus group discussions (n = 3) suggest that farmers are dealing with the challenges facing their traditional agricultural practices. The main adaptation strategies include changing crop types and varieties, adding fertilizers, the use of new technologies, soil and water management, diversification of income sources, and migration. Both climatic and non-climatic factors were found to influence these subsistence smallholder farmers’ adaptation practices. However, climatic factors that are beyond individual control threatened the livelihood of rural farmers who predominantly rely on natural resources for their livelihood and income. The findings highlight the interplay of multiple agents: local farmers, community-based organizations, and the local and central government organizations in the role they play in assisting farmers adapt to the impacts of climate change; this interplay emphasizes the need for collaboration for effective adaptation. The findings from this study can inform policymakers about ongoing adaptation measures as well as the needs of farmers. This information can assist in bridging the gap between farm households and policymakers and help develop suitable policies and effective adaptation strategies within this local Nepalese context. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The most affected organisms are those with narrow tolerance to the climatic factors but many large mammals such as ungulates with a wider ecological niche are also being affected indirectly. Our research mainly used wild sheep in central Iran as a model species to explore how the suitable habitats will change under different climatic scenarios and to determine if current borders of protected areas will adequately protect habitat requirements. To create habitat models we used animal-vehicle collision points as an input for species presence data. We ran habitat models using MaxEnt modeling approach under different climatic scenarios of the past, present and future (under the climatic scenarios for minimum (RCP2.6) and maximum (RCP8.5) CO2 concentration trajectories). We tried to estimate the overlap and the width of the ecological niche using relevant metrics. In order to analyze the effectiveness of the protected areas, suitable maps were concerted to binary maps using True Skill Statistic (TSS) threshold and measured the similarity of the binary maps for each scenario using Kappa index. In order to assess the competence of the present protected areas boundary in covering the distribution of species, two different scenarios were employed, which are ensemble scenario 1: an ensemble of the binary maps of the species distribution in Mid-Holocene, present, and RCP2.6; and ensemble scenario 2: an ensemble of binary suitability maps in Mid-Holocene, present, and RCP8.5. Then, the borders of modeled habitats with the boundaries of 23 existing protected areas in two central provinces in Iran were compared. The predicted species distribution under scenario 1 (RCP2.6) was mostly similar to its current distribution (Kappa = 0.53) while the output model under scenario 2 (RCP8.5) indicated a decline in the species distribution range. Under the first ensemble scenario, current borders of the protected areas in Hamedan province showed better efficiency to cover the model species distribution range. Analyzing MaxEnt spatial models under the second climatic scenario suggested that protected areas in both Markazi and Hamedan provinces will not cover “high suitability” areas in the future. Modeling the efficiency of the current protected areas under predicted future climatic scenarios can help the related authorities to plan conservation activities more efficiently. © 2020, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climatic Scenarios; Niche modeling; Protected area; Species Distribution Modeling; Wild Sheep","climate change; collision; ensemble forecasting; mapping method; maximum entropy analysis; niche; population distribution; protected area; sheep; wild population; Hamadan; Iran; Markazi; Animalia; Mammalia; Ovis aries; Ungulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078581351

We formed scenarios for future technological progress, demand growth, and biofuel policy and carried out a dynamic simulation. The major findings are: (1) Increasing technological progress reduces cropland for biofuel and cropland pasture for livestock but increases cropland for crop production; (2) Reducing corn ethanol requirements causes more cropland to move from cropping to pasture uses for livestock, however, lowering ethanol from corn residue has minor effects on cropland use; (3) Lowering the requirement of ethanol from corn lowers the price for most of the field crops and meat commodities, especially corn, hay, sorghum, and non-fed beef; (4) Technological progress and biofuel policy have significant effects of on GHG emissions. Increasing technical progress reduces overall GHG emissions. A lower corn ethanol level results in much larger GHG emissions as compared with the control case. This implies producing corn ethanol is effective in reducing emissions; and (5) Technological improvement is a key factor in meeting growing global demand for food and energy and reducing emissions. © 2019 by the authors.","Agriculture; Bioenergy; Climate change; Energy policy; Land use; Technological progress","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Biofuels; Climate change; Commerce; Crops; Cultivation; Emission control; Ethanol; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Bio-energy; Biofuel policies; Crop production; Reducing emissions; Resource usage; Technical progress; Technological improvements; Technological progress; Energy policy; agricultural market; agricultural technology; bioenergy; climate change; crop production; energy policy; land use; livestock; technological development; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079690884

We have adopted B3PW91/LANL2DZ basis set to minimize the geometries of ZrAln and HfAln clusters. The stability analysis reveals that the ZrAl4 and HfAl4 structures with C2v symmetry and square pyramid geometry are the lowest energy structures. The most stable structures in ZrAl5 and HfAl5 are distorted tetrahedron type structure with symmetry C1. The binding energy per atom for transition metal-doped Aln clusters increases with the cluster size, while the second-order difference in total energy shows oscillatory behavior with even and odd cluster size. The HOMO – LUMO gap for ZrAln clusters is larger than the HfAln clusters except for n = 6 and 7. The HfAl4 clusters have more tendencies to accept or give away electrons. The negative charge exists on Zr and Hf indicating the electron transfers from Al atom to transition metal, Zr and Hf. The thermodynamical analysis suggests that the HfAl6 clusters with spin multiplicity one have the highest exothermicity compared to not only all considered Al clusters but also other transition metal-doped Al clusters as reported in J. Phys. Chem. C, 120, 10027 (2016). This reveals that the HfAl6 clusters with a spin multiplicity of one have more tendency towards the adsorption of CO2 compared to other clusters. The calculated adsorption energy of CO2 on ZrAln and HfAln nano clusters reveals the potential application for CO2 reduction. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Clusters; CO2 adsorption; Electronic states; Stability","Adsorption; Aluminum alloys; Atoms; Binary alloys; Binding energy; Carbon dioxide; Cluster analysis; Convergence of numerical methods; Density functional theory; Electronic properties; Electronic states; Hafnium; Nanoclusters; Zirconium; Adsorption energies; Clusters; CO2 adsorption; First-principles study; Lowest energy structure; Oscillatory behaviors; Structural and electronic properties; Thermodynamical analysis; Aluminum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073682427

Here, we have assembled a global map of the AHR gene regulatory network in female C57BL/6 mice orally gavaged with 30 µg/kg of TCDD from a combination of previously published gene expression and genome-wide TF-binding data sets. Using Kohonen self-organizing maps and subspace clustering, we show that genes co-regulated by common upstream TFs in the AHR network exhibit a pattern of co-expression. Directly bound, indirectly bound, and non-genomic AHR target genes exhibit distinct expression patterns, with the directly bound targets associated with highest median expression. Interestingly, among the directly bound AHR target genes, the expression level increases with the number of AHR-binding sites in the proximal promoter regions. Finally, we show that co-regulated genes in the AHR network activate distinct groups of downstream biological processes. Although the specific findings described here are restricted to hepatic effects under short-term TCDD exposure, this work describes a generalizable approach to the reconstruction and analysis of transcriptional regulatory cascades underlying cellular stress response, revealing network hierarchy and the nature of information flow from the initial signaling events to phenotypic outcomes. Such reconstructed networks can form the basis of a new generation of quantitative adverse outcome pathways. © 2019, The Author(s).","Co-expression; Co-regulation; Dioxin response element; DNA binding; Ligand-activated transcription factors; Phenotypic outcomes; Signaling","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; Ahr protein, mouse; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; basic helix loop helix transcription factor; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; adverse outcome pathway; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; binding site; biological phenomena and functions concerning the entire organism; cellular stress response; controlled study; female; gene cluster; gene expression; gene regulatory network; liver; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; regulatory mechanism; animal; C57BL mouse; drug effect; genetics; liver; metabolism; multigene family; physiology; Animals; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Sequencing; Female; Gene Regulatory Networks; Liver; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Multigene Family; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075259327

The study attempts to test the applicability of SWAT (Soil and Water Assessment Tool) to estimate sediment yield in a watershed in the Western Deccan, India. The study area is a part of the Tapi River Basin in Maharashtra state, which falls in the semi arid, the western part of the Deccan Trap Region. The banks of the river are deeply dissected by gullies and form badlands. Heavy land reclamation practices are going on these badlands for the purpose of agriculture, resulting in further degradation and soil loss in the area. SWAT (version ArcSWAT 2012_10_1.18), a physically based watershed scale hydrological model developed by the USDA-ARS was used for estimating sediment yield from the catchment. IRS Cartosat 1 stereo pair imageries and LISS IV multispectral imageries have been used to create DEM and landuse - landcover classification for the model. The soil map of the area was obtained from the National Bureau of Soil Survey and Landuse Planning and climate parameters were obtained from the Indian Meteorological Department. The average sediment yield predicted by the model is 3.9 kg/m2/yr. For the final verification of the results, the data is compared with a field study of a test catchment in the same watershed. Annual sediment yield was calculated using repeated topographic surveys at three years interval (2012 - 2015), which gave the value of 0.22 kg/m2/yr. This test catchment is a part of the sub watershed no 43 in the SWAT model. The same catchment was clipped and the SWAT model was simulated for the period from 2012 to 2015. The simulated result shows the annual sediment yield of 0.20 kg/m2/yr. Overall, the study demonstrates that the model can be successfully applied in the study area for Spatial Decision Support System (SDSS) to identify priority areas having high soil losses. © 2020 Institute of Indian Geographers.

This paper aims to examine the determinants of household decisions to adapt, it is also possible to target factors that facilitate or constrain adaptation. This helps to identify key components of current adaptive capacity, which leads to important insights into households’ competence to adapt in the future. Design/methodology/approach: This paper takes a full-pledged approach examining factors and processes that shape households’ climate adaptation decision-making in rural Cambodia at three levels: adaptation status, adaptation intensity and choices of adaptation strategy. The three-stage analyses are materialized by applying the double hurdle model and multivariate probit model, which provides a potential way to systematically assess household adaptation decision-making in rural settings. Findings: Results show a high level of involvement in adaptation among local households who are facing multiple stressors including climatic risks. The findings suggest that perceived climate change influence households’ decisions in both adaptation status and intensity. Access to financial credit, farmland size, water availability and physical asset holdings are identified as key factors promoting the adoption of more adaptation measures. To facilitate adaptation, collective effort and support at community level is important in providing knowledge based climate information dissemination and early warning systems. Public sector support and development aid programs should focus on positive triggers for targeted community and household adaptation. Originality/value: The study, to the authors’ best knowledge, is one of the first studies to investigate the determinants of local adaptation decision-making systematically in Cambodia. It also provides a comprehensive approach to improve understanding of adaptation decision-making processes by exploring how various capital assets are associated with different stages of adaptation decisions. The findings contribute to policy implications enlightening adaptation planning at multi-scales with knowledge of key factors, which enhance local adaptive capacity to reduce climate change vulnerability. © 2019, Xi Jiao, Yuan Zheng and Zhen Liu.","Adaptation decision; Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Rural livelihoods; Southeast Asia","adaptive management; agricultural land; climate change; decision making; development aid; livelihood; local adaptation; quantitative analysis; stakeholder; water availability; Cambodia; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077598354

The main findings are: (1) the structural emission reduction measures in all four regions had positive co-control effects. Therefore, promoting renewables can achieve remarkable co-benefits; (2) the result demonstrated that the direct removal ability of pollutants by technical emission reduction measures was better than the structural emission reduction measures in all four case studies. However, there were no or few carbon reduction co-benefits associated with their utilization; (3) in all cases, CO2 had the highest emission factor value, which means that there is still room for synergistic carbon reduction; (4) air pollutants and CO2 emission intensity from the Yunnan power plants were much higher than that of the other three regions.

This can be expressed in terms of the difference between the observed P-wave impedance squared and a multiplier times the square of the observed S-wave impedance. This multiplier is a fluid discrimination parameter that laboratory and log measurements suggest varies over a wide range. Theoretically, this parameter is related to the ratio of the frame bulk and shear moduli and the ratio of the frame and fluid-saturated rock densities. In practice, empirical determination of the fluid discrimination parameter may be required for a given locality. Given sufficient data for calibration, the parameter can be adjusted so as to best distinguish hydrocarbon-saturated targets from brine-saturated rocks. Using an empirically optimized fluid discrimination parameter has a greater impact on hydrocarbon detection success rate in the oil cases studied than for gas reservoirs, for which there is more latitude. Application to a wide variety of well-log and laboratory measurements suggests that the empirically optimized parameter may differ from direct theoretical calculations made using Gassmann's equations. Combining laboratory and log measurements for sandstones having a broad range of frame moduli, varying from poorly consolidated to highly lithified, reveals a simple linear empirical relationship between the optimized fluid discrimination parameter and the squared velocity ratio of brine-saturated sandstones. © 2020 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.","fluid; log analysis; reservoir characterization; rock physics; seismic impedance","Hydrocarbons; Oil well logging; Petroleum reservoirs; Sandstone; Seismic waves; Seismology; Shear waves; Well logging; Empirical relationships; Gassmann's equations; Hydrocarbon detection; Laboratory measurements; Optimized parameter; Saturated sandstones; Seismic reflectivity; Theoretical calculations; Parameter estimation; hydrocarbon reservoir; P-wave; reservoir characterization; rock mechanics; S-wave; sandstone; seismic method; seismic reflection; shear modulus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85112397712

The estimated carbon emission trends are upward sloping for China and India and downward sloping for Germany. However, for the USA and Japan, the underlying trend in carbon emission shows mix results.

The 56th Rankine Lecture considered one of the most pressing global problems: maintaining vital energy supplies while also recognising, mitigating and reducing the climate consequences of fossil fuel consumption. This written version reports geotechnical research relating to these wide-ranging issues, considering paired topics within its three main parts and illustrating these with specific practical examples. Part 1 focuses on supporting offshore hydrocarbon production, considering advances in understanding and designing the driven piles that support most continental shelf platforms, before moving to the large underwater landslides that can affect deeper water developments. Part 2 describes investigations into the geotechnical impact of climate change in a permafrost region and a peatland study that contributes to alleviating flood risks exacerbated by climate change. Part 3 outlines research that is improving the economics of renewable offshore wind energy for multi-pile and monopile supported turbines. Integrating geology and rigorous analysis with advanced laboratory and field experiments is shown to be essential to resolving the complex geotechnical problems considered, as is careful full-scale checking and monitoring. Close cooperation with co-workers from industry and academia was central to the studies described and the contributions of many collaborators are emphasised.

As a result of this urgency and interest, more questionnaires are being circulated, more metrics are being gathered, and more time and resources are being invested to provide accurate and complete answers to customer questions concerning their supplier’s sustainability performance. There has been increased regulation in Asia, it has become an expected practice in Europe, and investors in the U.S. are increasingly using this information to inform their decision-making.11 In the coming years, the sustainability disclosure community anticipates that streamlining reporting standards to enable greater efficiency in the reporting process is crucial to creating a more user-friendly platform that even further encourages companies to report. Secondly, more involvement and oversight of ESG disclosures at the executive level should help leverage sustainability efforts. Thirdly, the future of sustainability reporting will hopefully become further integrated into mainstream financial disclosures, rather than segregated into a company’s designated annual sustainability report.11 ABOUT KERAMIDA Established in 1988, KERAMIDA is a WBE-certified environmental engineering and consulting firm that serves industries, businesses, cities, and governments worldwide. KERAMIDA is headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, with additional offices in Granger, IN; Chicago, IL; Pittsburgh, PA; New York, NY; Los Angeles, CA, and Sacramento, CA. KERAMIDA provides consultation to determine if companies are subject to mandatory reporting for GHG emissions. If it is determined that a company is subject to mandatory GHG reporting, KERAMIDA can prepare and submit GHG emissions reports under the supervision of our California Air Resources Board (CARB) Accredited Lead GHG Verifier. By being prepared and managed by a CARB Accredited Lead GHG Verifier, we can minimize any complications that may arise from the required third-party verification process for facilities operating within the state of California. KERAMIDA can also verify a company’s GHG footprint and evaluate its emission reduction opportunities for non-regulatory required purposes. This verification can be for stakeholder requests for sustainability or for self-disclosure reporting with recognized registries such as CDP and GRI.

HDCR consists of 2 catalytic subunits, a hydrogenase and a formate dehydrogenase (FDH) and two small subunits carrying iron-sulfur clusters. The enzyme complex has been purified and characterized from two acetogenic bacteria, from the mesophile Acetobacterium woodii and, recently, from the thermophile Thermoanaerobacter kivui. Physiological studies toward the importance of the HDCR for growth and formate metabolism in acetogens have not been carried out yet, due to the lack of genetic tools. Here, we deleted the genes encoding HDCR in T. kivui taking advantage of the recently developed genetic system. As expected, the deletion mutant (strain TKV_MB013) did not grow with formate as single substrate or under autotrophic conditions with H2 + CO2. Surprisingly, the strain did also not grow on any other substrate (sugars, mannitol or pyruvate), except for when formate was added. Concentrated cell suspensions quickly consumed formate in the presence of glucose only. In conclusion, HDCR provides formate which was essential for growth of the T. kivui mutant. Alternatively, extracellularly added formate served as terminal electron acceptor in addition to CO2, complementing the growth deficiency.

Here, we used phytoplankton, which are a classic model for evaluating interactions between species, grown with and without associated bacteria to test whether the bacteria alter the strength and type of species interactions within a trophic level. We demonstrate that host-associated bacteria alter host growth rates and carrying capacity. This did not change the type but frequently changed the strength of host interspecific interactions by facilitating host growth in the presence of an established species. These findings indicate that microbiomes can regulate their host species’ interspecific interactions. As between-species interaction strength impacts their ability to coexist, our findings show that microbiomes have the potential to modulate eukaryotic species diversity and community composition. IMPORTANCE Description of the Earth’s microbiota has recently undergone a phenomenal expansion that has challenged basic assumptions in many areas of biology, including hominid evolution, human gastrointestinal and neurodevelopmental disorders, and plant adaptation to climate change. By using the classic model system of freshwater phytoplankton that has been drawn upon for numerous foundational theories in ecology, we show that microbiomes, by facilitating their host population, can also influence between-species interactions among their eukaryotic hosts. Between-species interactions, including competition for resources, has been a central tenet in the field of ecology because of its implications for the diversity and composition of communities and how this in turn shapes ecosystem functioning. © 2020 Jackrel et al.","Biodiversity; Eukaryotic species interactions; Microbiome; Species coexistence","algal growth; analysis of variance; Article; cell selection; chloroplast; Coelastrum microporum; controlled study; denaturation; genotype; microbial community; microbiome; microscopy; Monoraphidium minutum; nonhuman; organismal interaction; phytoplankton; polymerase chain reaction; population density; population growth; priority journal; Scenedesmus acuminatus; Selenastrum capricornutum; species diversity; Sphaeropleales; staining; biodiversity; host pathogen interaction; host range; microflora; organismal interaction; Biodiversity; Host Specificity; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Microbial Interactions; Microbiota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078236016

Two different mechanisms that limit field foam propagation, such as “conversion from strong foam to weak foam” and “gravity segregation,” are examined separately, and the results are combined together. The first is performed by using a mechanistic foam model based on bubble population balance, while the second is conducted by an analytical model (called Stone and Jenkins model) and reservoir simulations with a commercial software (CMG-STARS). Note that the gas-phase mobility, required as a key input parameter for gravity segregation simulations, is calibrated by the mechanistic model, which is a significant advance in this study. The results from both mechanisms show in general that foam propagation distance increases with increasing injection pressure or rate (which is often limited by the formation fracturing pressure) and increases with decreasing foam quality down to a certain threshold foam quality below which the distance is not sensitive to foam quality any longer. It is found that the mobilization pressure gradient (i.e., the pressure gradient above which foam films are mobilized to create a population of bubbles) plays a key role to determine the distance. Therefore, the injection of supercritical CO2 foams with lower mobilization pressure gradient should be more favored in field applications. As a step prior to real-world reservoir applications, this study deals with a relatively ideal reservoir (i.e., large homogeneous cylindrical reservoir) focusing on the steady state after foam treatment in the absence of oil. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","CO2 foam; Foam propagation; Gravity segregation; Population balance model","Pressure gradient; Commercial software; Different mechanisms; Fracturing pressure; Gravity segregation; Mechanistic modeling; Population balance modeling; Propagation distances; Reservoir simulation; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; computer simulation; fluid injection; foam; numerical model; supercritical flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050614719

The implementation of some practices need to be readjusted due to steadily increasing temperature and lowering precipitation. For farmers, the best practice found, should have the potential to achieve maximum sustainable levels of soil productivity in the context of climate change. A study was conducted in South-West Niger to investigate the use of the suitable practice, through (i) a meta-analysis of case studies, (ii) using field survey and (iii) by using AquaCrop model. Results showed that the effects of the association zaï + mulch on crop yield was up to 2 times higher than control plots depending on climate projections scenario RCP 8.5 under which carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations are projected to reach 936 ppm by 2100. The practice appeared to be an interesting option for enhancing crop productivity in a context of climate change. Concerning its ability, it offers the best prospects to reverse soil degradation in the study area. In addition, the simulation showed that this strategy was suitable for timely sowing and therefore confirmed scholars and farmers views. Furthermore, this practice is relatively more effective compared to the others practices. These results show that association zaï + mulch could be considered as the best practice that can participate to a successful adaptation to reduce risk from climate change at the same time by reducing the vulnerability of farmers in Southwest of Niger for now and even for the future. © 2020 The Author(s)","Agricultural science; AquaCrop model; Climate change adaptation; Environmental science; Scholars and local knowledge; Soil restoration strategies; Southwest Niger",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077981432

This is particularly the case for resource-constrained countries, such as Bangladesh, which contributes little to global gas emissions, yet is most vulnerable to climate change. However, Bangladesh has adopted a pro-poor and climate-resilient development pathway for achieving sustainable development by 2021. Among many other initiatives, the Bangladesh Climate Change Trust Fund (BCCTF), drawing from the national budget, is one of the key initiatives to reduce vulnerability and to increase resilience. This chapter seeks to draw lessons for climate change adaptation programmes in Bangladesh by investigating 472 projects implemented since the inception of the BCCTF in 2009. Questions asking how these projects are implemented and how they are contributing to building a climate-resilient Bangladesh are yet to be studied. Therefore, this study aims to examine the list of all the projects implemented by BCCTF, to identify how these projects are increasing resilience by focusing on the six themes of the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) to further explore the scope of achieving Bangladesh’s climate goals. This chapter draws from 38 in-depth interviews (IDIs) from key stakeholders to investigate the focus, nature, volume and regional distribution of these projects. Findings demonstrate significant progress in adaptation readiness, preparing policies and programs, coordinating participation and implementation strategies with a range of ministries and local government. The BCCTF allocated funds to all the thematic areas mentioned in BCCSAP where many of the funded projects addressed climate change well achieving infrastructural, institutional and community resilience. However, some challenges emerged such as a scarcity of funds reflecting difficulties in accessing global climate funds, and the lack of climate-vulnerability assessment for each district and subdistrict area. IDIs recommended that strategies and appropriate negotiations need to be in place to access more international climate funds, collaboration and communication between the ministries and local governments should be enhanced and monitoring and evaluation of the project implementation on a case-by-case basis is needed to increase efficiency and effectiveness. © 2020 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

In February 2018 a series of convective storms erupted in Jupiter's South Temperate Belt (STB) (planetocentric latitudes from −23° to −29.5°). This occurred inside an elongated cyclonic region known popularly as the STB Ghost, close to the large anticyclone Oval BA, resulting in the clouds from the storms being confined to the cyclone. The initial storms lasted only a few days but they generated abundant enduring turbulence. They also produced dark features, possibly partially devoid of clouds, that circulated around the cyclone over the first week. The subsequent activity developed over months and resulted in two main structures, one of them closely interacting with Oval BA and the other one being expelled to the west. Here we present a study of this meteorological activity based on daily observations provided by the amateur community, complemented by observations obtained from PlanetCam UPV/EHU at Calar Alto Observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope and by JunoCam on the Juno spacecraft. We also perform numerical simulations with the EPIC General Circulation Model to reproduce the phenomenology observed. The successful simulations require a complex interplay between the Ghost, the convective eruptions and Oval, and they demonstrate that water moist convection was the source of the initial storms. A simple scale comparison with other moist convective storms that can be observed in the planet in visible and methane absorption band images strongly suggests that most of these storms are powered by water condensation instead of ammonia. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Atmospheres; Dynamics; Jupiter",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073698141

This approximation assures the range accuracy of charged-particle beams. However, it causes dose calculation errors due to water nonequivalence of body tissues in nuclear interactions originating from compositional differences. We had previously proposed and validated a PID correction method for the errors in carbon-ion radiotherapy. In the present study, we verify the PID correction method for helium-, oxygen-, and neon-ion beams. The one-to-one relationships between ρ S and the nuclear effective density ρ N of body tissues were constructed for helium-, carbon-, oxygen-, and neon-ion beams, and were used to correct the PIDs to account for the dose calculation errors in patient. The correction method was tested for non-water materials with un-scanned and scanned ion beams. In un-scanned beams penetrating the materials, the dose calculation errors of up to 5.9% were observed at the Bragg peak region, while they were reduced to 0.9% by the PID correction method. In scanned beams penetrating olive oil, the dose calculation errors of up to 2.7% averaged over the spread-out Bragg peak were observed, while they were reduced to 0.4% by the correction method. To investigate the influence of water nonequivalence of body tissues on tumor dose, we carried out a treatment planning study for prostate and uterine cases. The tumor over-doses of 0.9%, 1.8%, 2.0%, and 2.2% were observed in the uterine case for the helium-, carbon-, oxygen-, and neon-ion beams, respectively. These dose errors could be diminished by the PID correction method. The present results verify that the PID correction method is simple, practical, and accurate for treatment planning of these four ion species. © 2020 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",,"Carbon; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Errors; Helium; Histology; Ions; Neon; Olive oil; Oxygen; Patient treatment; Tumors; Carbon ion radiotherapy; Compositional difference; Dose distributions; Effective density; Influence of water; Nuclear interaction; Spread out Bragg peaks; Treatment planning; Ion beams",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078507179

In 2007, the Aura Landfill was equipped with a landfill gas burning system in a CDM/UNFCCC project, with reported measured volumes of burned methane gas. These volumes were used to retrieve the methane generation potential (L0) and the decay rate (k) parameters of single-phase, first order landfill emission model, yielding L0=(61.0±6.6)mCH4 3/MgMSW and k=(0.25±0.07)yr-1. To model the Aura landfill, local gravimetric waste composition and local per capita waste production studies were collected, and the IPCC first order multiphase model was used. For the generation potential, observation and model are consistent, but for the decay rate, observations provide a 39% higher value, suggesting that the methane production from deposited MSW is occurring much faster than predicted by the IPCC model. Applying the retrieved parameters for the whole landfill's lifetime, the total produced methane is estimated to be 497 Gg (ranging from 444 Gg to 550 Gg), of this total 48% may have been emitted before the implementation of the collection system, indicating that it was implemented too late, and 81% may have been emitted before the closing date, with only 19% to be emitted after the end of operations.

To mitigate the CH4 emissions, strong acid addition to the manure was attempted, which is only applicable to slurry-type manure. On the other hand, lowering the storage temperature could be an effective method to reduce the CH4 emissions, particularly applicable to solid-type manure. In this study, cattle manure (CM) with a high-solid content (TS &gt; 30%) was stored at different temperatures (15–35 °C) for 80 d. The highest CH4 emissions of 375.1 kg CO2 eq./ton VS was observed at 35 °C, and this was reduced to less than half at ≤20 °C. Like the difference in CH4 emissions, the degradation of organic matter showed a similar trend. The maximum VS reduction of 29% was observed at 35 °C, while only 8% reduction was observed at 15 °C. Results from microbial community analyses and specific methanogenic activity tests indicated that hydrogenotrophic methanogens were the dominant indigenous CH4-producers, and the abundance of psychrophilic methanogens increased with decreasing temperature. The conservation of organic matter at low temperature led to an increase in biogas production potential from 25 to 43 L CH4/kg CM. It was calculated that the GHGs emissions from electricity consumption for cooling CM below 25 °C can be offset by mitigating CH4 emissions during storage but increasing in subsequent biogas production potential of CM.

TROPOMI NO2 total (summed) columns are compared with the measurements performed by the Pandora spectrometer between April and September 2018. The mean relative and absolute bias between the TROPOMI and Pandora NO2 total columns is about 10 and 0.12×1015 molec. cm-2 respectively. The dispersion of these differences (estimated as their standard deviation) is 2.2×1015 molec. cm-2. We find high correlation (r = 0.68) between satellite- and ground-based data, but also that TROPOMI total columns underestimate ground-based observations for relatively large Pandora NO2 total columns, corresponding to episodes of relatively elevated pollution. This is expected because of the relatively large size of the TROPOMI ground pixel (3.5×7 km) and the a priori used in the retrieval compared to the relatively small field-of-view of the Pandora instrument. On the other hand, TROPOMI slightly overestimates (within the retrieval uncertainties) relatively small NO2 total columns. Replacing the coarse a priori NO2 profiles with high-resolution profiles from the CAMS chemical transport model improves the agreement between TROPOMI and Pandora total columns for episodes of NO2 enhancement. When only the low values of NO2 total columns or the whole dataset are taken into account, the mean bias slightly increases. The change in bias remains mostly within the uncertainties. We also analyse the consistency between satellite-based data and in situ NO2 surface concentrations measured at the Helsinki-Kumpula air quality station (located a few metres from the Pandora spectrometer). We find similar day-to-day variability between TROPOMI, Pandora and in situ measurements, with NO2 enhancements observed during the same days. Both satellite- and ground-based data show a similar weekly cycle, with lower NO2 levels during the weekend compared to the weekdays as a result of reduced emissions from traffic and industrial activities (as expected in urban sites). The TROPOMI NO2 maps reveal also spatial features, such as the main traffic ways and the airport area, as well as the effect of the prevailing south-west wind patterns. This is one of the first works in which TROPOMI NO2 retrievals are validated against ground-based observations and the results provide an early evaluation of their applicability for monitoring pollution levels in urban sites. Overall, TROPOMI retrievals are valuable to complement the ground-based air quality data (available with high temporal resolution) for describing the spatio-temporal variability of NO2, even in a relatively small city like Helsinki. © 2020 Author(s).",,"air quality; data set; dispersion; environmental monitoring; industrial emission; nitrogen dioxide; Sentinel; spatiotemporal analysis; troposphere; wind field; Finland; Helsinki; Varsinais-Suomi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078287797

Although these bioaerosols come in a wide range of particle size, of 14 common types nine fall into the 0– 10 µm range and four are in the 0– 2.5 µm range. These bioaerosols contribute to the concentrations of particulates determined by both filter-based and continuous instruments. This paper reviews bioaerosol research conducted worldwide in the last twenty years. Such studies have been conducted in Toronto, Canada, central Germany, Phoenix, Arizona, Davis, California, Dallas, Texas, and at many other sites worldwide. Notwithstanding the wide variety of climates, ecological systems, and urban and rural environments in which these measurements have been made, a reasonable, first-order estimate of the overall bioaerosol contribution to particles 2.5 microns and smaller (PM2.5) is 16.5% and to particles 10 microns and smaller (PM10) is 16.3%. A percentage contribution of this magnitude from unregulated emissions means that achieving PM standards will require greater reductions in the better understood anthropogenic and natural emissions of geological and combustion particles. In one such case the emission reductions necessary to achieve the standard increase from 25% (with bioaerosols ignored) to 36% (with bioaerosols accounted for). Although to the uninitiated this difference may not appear to be substantial, it can only be considered vast and nearly regulatorily impossible to those policy makers and regulators responsible for enacting emission-reduction regulations. Emissions of airborne biological materials are unregulated. Ignoring this natural component in attempting to achieve national ambient air quality standards for particulates can lead to overly optimistic predictions of attainment. Implications: For those officials still striving to meet federal air quality standards for particulate matter, either PM10 or PM2.5, it would be prudent to acknowledge the presence of unregulated bioaerosols. Ignoring this portion of PM may lead to over-optimistic projections of attainment. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.",,"Aerosols; Air quality; Air quality standards; Biological materials; Emission control; Particle size; Quality control; Air pollution monitoring; Airborne particulate matters; Biological entities; Coarse particulate matter; Emission reduction; National ambient air quality standards; Natural components; Unregulated emissions; Particles (particulate matter); air quality standard; ambient air; Arizona; California; Canada; climate; combustion; ecosystem; Germany; human; human cell; mental capacity; particulate matter; prediction; review; rural area; Texas; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; particle size; particulate matter; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Particle Size; Particulate Matter",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075941749

The Galactic Faraday depth sky is a tracer for both the Galactic magnetic field and the thermal electron distribution. It was previously reconstructed from polarimetric measurements of extra-Galactic point sources. Aims. Here we improve on these works by using an updated inference algorithm and by taking into account the electron emission measure as traced by free-free emission measured by the Planck survey. In the future the data situation will improve drastically thanks to the next generation Faraday rotation measurements from the SKA and its pathfinders. Anticipating this, a further aim of this paper is to update the map reconstruction method with some of the latest developments in Bayesian imaging. Methods. To this end we made use of information field theory, an inference scheme that is particularly powerful in cases of noisy and incomplete data. Results. We demonstrate the validity of the new algorithm by applying it to an existing data compilation. Even though we used exactly the same data set, a number of novel findings are made; for example, a non-parametric reconstruction of an overall amplitude field resembles the free-free emission measure map of the Galaxy. Folding this emission measure map into the analysis provides more detailed predictions. The joint inference enables us to identify regions with deviations from the assumed correlations between the emission measure and Faraday data, thereby pointing us to Galactic structures with distinguishably different physics. We find evidence for an alignment of the magnetic field within the lines of sight along both directions of the Orion arm. © S. Hutschenreuter and T. A.

Pakistan’s low adaptive capacity due to high poverty rate, limited financial resources and shortage of physical resources, and continual extreme climatic events including varying temperature, continual flooding, melting glaciers, saturation of lakes, earthquakes, hurricanes, storms, avalanches, droughts, scarcity of water, pest diseases, human healthcare issues, and seasonal and lifestyle changes have persistently threatened the ecosystem, biodiversity, human communities, animal habitations, forests, lands, and oceans with a potential to cause further damages in the future. The likely effect of climate change on common residents of Pakistan with comparison to the world and their per capita impact of climate change are terribly high with local animal species such as lions, vultures, dolphins, and tortoise facing extinction regardless of generating and contributing diminutively to global GHG emissions. The findings of the review suggested that GHG emissions cause climate change which has impacted agriculture livestock and forestry, weather trends and patterns, food water and energy security, and society of Pakistan. This review is a sectorial evaluation of climate change mitigation and adaption approaches in Pakistan in the aforementioned sectors and its economic costs which were identified to be between 7 to 14 billion USD per annum.

Annually, million tons of glass bottle wastes are generated and only a few percent are recycled. In this study, glass bottles waste Nano powder (BGWNP) was prepared by replacing ground blast furnace slag (GBFS) in fly ash-based alkali-activated mortars (AAMs). The main aim was to evaluate the energy consumption, cost effectiveness, mechanical and chemical properties of the achieved BGWNP blended AAMs. Reuse of such wastes was found to enhance the mechanical and durability properties of the resultant AAMs as well as reduced CO2 emissions. For AAM incorporating 5% of BGWNP as GBFS replacement, the CO2 emission reduced (over 6%), compressive strength enhanced (above 16%) and the durability improved with reduced water absorption. Additionally, it lowered the binder cost and energy consumption by 3.4 and 1.3%, respectively. Furthermore, AAM composed of 10% BGWNP revealed reduced strength performance. It was concluded that the proposed AAMs obtained using BGWNP offer definitive environmental benefits by minimizing global warming. Given that concrete still is the most used man-made material universally, such proposition would significantly reduce the landfill requirements for glass waste that is unsuitable for recycled glass production. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","AAMs; BGWNP; GBFS; Nanotechnology; Sustainability","Blast furnaces; Carbon dioxide; Compressive strength; Consumer products; Cost effectiveness; Durability; Energy utilization; Fly ash; Glass; Global warming; Mortar; Nanostructured materials; Nanotechnology; Recycling; Slags; Sustainable development; Water absorption; AAMs; Alkali-activated mortars; BGWNP; Carbon dioxide emissions; Environmental benefits; GBFS; Ground blast furnace slags; Mechanical and durability properties; Glass bottles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072781580

Urban stream restoration and stormwater management involve conventional and low impact development strategies that may employ ecological engineering techniques. Urban flood-risks may increase rapidly due to the combination of land-use and climate change. This is a major research frontier because the changes are poorly understood, especially for the combined impacts of climate and land-use change in small catchments. Climate and land-use change may affect hydrologic systems in a complex, non-linear, and non-additive manner. Streamflow simulation models can measure the relative magnitude of land-use and climate change on hydrologic response to precipitation events. Based on a simulation model calibrated with instrumental rainfall and streamflow data, this study compares simulated urban stormflow response to projected land-use and climate change in two highly urbanized catchments in Columbia, South Carolina, USA, using the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)’s Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). Runoff responses for moderate-magnitude storms are contrasted using three land-use change scenarios with differing imperviousness and three climate-change scenarios. Land-use effects on runoff were proportionally greater in the smaller of the two catchments. At the headwater and downstream gauges, a warm/wet climate-change scenario caused larger increases than land-use changes in peak discharges and total event runoff volumes from late spring to early fall. The maximum monthly increase in peak discharge and total runoff volume from all simulations of climate change was for the warm/wet climate scenario in both catchments. However, the combined climate and land-use change scenario produced a 117.9% increase in peak discharge, a slightly (up to 8.6% in September) greater increase in peak discharge than the sum of changes from the individual scenarios (82.6% from climate change and 26.7% from land-use change) at the headwater gauge for the far term (2045–2074). These results suggest a complexity and nonlinearity of the impacts of combined land-use and climate change on hydrological processes, and have implications for stream restoration projects, integrated climate-impact assessments, urban planning, and policy decisions related to storm runoff and water quality. © 2019","Anthropocene land-use change; Climate change scenarios; Headwater stream restoration; Stormwater runoff; Streamflow modeling; Watershed management","Catchments; Climate models; Ecodesign; Ecology; Environmental management; Environmental Protection Agency; Floods; Gages; Land use; Precipitation (meteorology); Restoration; Runoff; Soil conservation; Storm sewers; Storms; Stream flow; Urban planning; Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Climate change scenarios; Headwater stream; Land-use change; Storm water runoff; Streamflow modeling; Watershed management; Climate change; Anthropocene; basin management; catchment; climate change; complexity; ecological engineering; headwater; hydrological modeling; land use change; peak discharge; rainfall; runoff; streamflow; South Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075312798

Such experts have frequently used offshore technologies for the construction of flood-resilient floating structures and for zero-carbon energy generation, such as in the case of offshore wind parks, simultaneously tackling the problem of carbon fuel-related air pollution. Such developments draw attention to the intellectual history of ocean industrialization, its driving forces, and related environmental thought. This article examines the intellectual origins of ecomodernism and similar green growth strategies. Using an oceanic perspective and placing the ideas of Japanese star architect and Metabolist movement member Kiyonori Kikutake and US ocean expert John P. Craven at its center, this article argues that their two prototypes of floating industrial combines tested in Hawaii and Okinawa during the early 1970s applied the Japanese Metabolist movement's design principles of mobility, modularity, and plug-in structures to Pacific waters in an effort to decouple ocean industrialization from the destruction of ecosystems. Several of their proto-ecomodernist ideas, born as techno-optimist reactions to neo-Malthusian fears of resource depletion and overpopulation, have become central pillars of ecomodernist thought. As such, their projects turned into the immediate forerunner of current development strategies whose intellectual aim is to continue growth during (or despite) environmental challenges up to the planetary scale. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

Herein, we present a facile hydrothermal-carbonization approach to rationally fabricate a novel sycamore-fruit-like SnO2-based anode material (denoted as H7-500) for LIBs to simultaneously achieve high capacity, long-term cycling stability and ultrahigh rate capability. Structural analyses reveal that H7-500 possesses a sycamore-fruit-like hierarchical structure and is composed of 6–8 nm SnO2 nanoparticles coated with 1.7 nm thin carbon skins embedded on the surface region of 400 nm highly porous carbon spheres. The formation of sycamore-fruit-like structure is confirmed to be promoted by the Ostwald ripening. H7-500 delivers capabilities of 1242.3, 1116.5, 1004.8, 878, 745.8 and 488.7 mAh∙g−1 at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1, 2 and 5 A g−1, respectively. A high capacity of 905.4 mAh∙g−1 sustains after 300 cycles at 1 A g−1 and a capacitance of 413.4 mAh∙g−1 maintains after 1000 cycles at 5 A g−1. Notably, H7-500 electrodes exhibit excellent sustainable stability and endurability with sustainable capacities of 177.8 mAh∙g−1 at 10 A g−1 over 4000 cycles and 133.4 mAh∙g−1 at 20 A g−1 over 10000 cycles, respectively. Frequently tuning the rate between 0.1 and 10 A g−1 has no effect on the capacity and cycling stability of H7-500. The sycamore-fruit-like H7-500 shows excellent structural stability during the charge/discharge process. The unique structure not only solves the conventional problem of pulverization, particle aggregation and volume changes but also enhances structural integrity and the reversible reaction, and accelerates the reaction rate. These features render the materials excellent electrochemical performances with high capacity, superior rate capability and long-term cycling stability. The present results may also provide insights into the ongoing extensive endeavor to improve the properties of other electrode materials. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anode; Hierarchical nanostructure; Lithium ion battery; Rate performance; Tin dioxide","Agglomeration; Carbon; Carbonization; Fabrication; Fruits; Lithium; Lithium-ion batteries; Nanostructures; Porous materials; Stability; Tin dioxide; Electrochemical performance; Hierarchical Nanostructures; Hierarchical structures; Hydrothermal carbonization; Porous carbon spheres; Rate performance; Structural stabilities; Sustainable capacity; Anodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077359546

In this study, a new increment method is applied to the decadal prediction of summer precipitation during 1961–2014 over North China, which has suffered water resource scarcity and increased droughts in recent decades. There are three steps in the increment method. First, the DP over North China is obtained by applying a 5-year running mean. Second, the 3-year decadal increment (DI) of the DP (DP at the current year minus the DP at the 3 years before, DI_DP) is predicted by a statistical model with the leading 3-year DI of sea surface temperature anomalies over the North Atlantic and the leading 4-year DI of the sea ice concentration over the East Siberian Sea. Third, the well-predicted DI_DP is added to the observed DP at 3 years ago to obtain the final DP prediction. With realistic DP prediction, including correct regime shifts, the increment method provides a promising and valuable approach to decadal climate prediction. ©2020.

To assess the feasibility and viability of IEX processes for full-scale application, this study aimed at providing an evaluation of performance and economics on upscaling these processes for two different configurations in a 10,000 population equivalent wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) and compared them with a traditional biological nutrient removal (BNR) plant. The IEX processes were designed based on existing pilot-scale data, and after aerobic or anaerobic carbon removal stages. The nutrients were recovered from spent regenerants in the form of (NH4)2SO4 and hydroxyapatite Ca5(PO4)3(OH), allowing regenerant reuse. The 40-year whole life cost (WLC) of IEX coupled with traditional activated sludge processes was estimated to be ~£7.4 M, and WLC of IEX coupled with anaerobic membrane process was estimated to be £6.1 M, which was, respectively, 17% and 27% less than the traditional BNR based WWTP. Furthermore, ~98 tonnes of (NH4)2SO4 and 3.4 tonnes of Ca3(PO4)2 could be recovered annually. The benefits of lower costs, reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and nutrient recovery aligned with circular economy, illustrated that IEX processes are attractive for nutrient removal and recovery from municipal wastewater. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"Activated sludge process; Biological water treatment; Economic analysis; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydroxyapatite; Ion exchange; Nitrogen compounds; Recovery; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic membrane; Biological nutrient removal; Economic evaluations; Full-scale applications; Ion exchange process; Municipal wastewaters; Nutrient recovery; Wastewater treatment plants; Nutrients; economic analysis; feasibility study; ion exchange; nutrient; performance assessment; upscaling; wastewater treatment plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085004872

Within National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)'s Land Information System (LIS), a long-term offline Noah-multiparameterization (MP) simulation with dynamic vegetation is performed. Modeled soil moisture and leaf area index are evaluated with satellite observations to ensure that land surface conditions are moderately well reproduced. The LIS output is then used to initialize several coupled NASA-Unified Weather Research and Forecasting model simulations with online chemistry in which urban anthropogenic and shipping emissions are (1) largely based on the Hemispheric Transport of Air Pollution Phase 2 inventory for 2010, (2) reduced by 20% and 50% for all chemical species, and (3) adjusted only for nitrogen oxides (NOx) using satellite observations. Overall, modeled gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration almost linearly increase with the all-species emission reductions, but their responses to emission-induced aerosol optical depth (AOD) changes show strong spatial variability resulting from combined radiation and temperature impacts. Using satellite-observation-constrained NOx emissions, modeled nitrogen species and AOD better match various measurements at some locations/times. All-species and NOx-only emission adjustments lead to different gross primary productivity and evapotranspiration changes with AOD, especially over South Korea. This study demonstrates the importance of accurately quantifying emission impacts on atmosphere-biosphere interactions. Improving more species' emission inputs for Earth system models, including applying effective chemical data assimilation methods, is strongly encouraged. © 2020. American Geophysical Union.

For implementing thermal insulation, a key problem is the proper selection of wall insulation in terms of material types and optimum thicknesses because it is challenged to balance energy-saving effects and economic benefits. To address this problem, we investigated the new aerogel super-insulation material for building-energy-conservation application in this paper. Specifically, we took a typical office building of humid subtropical climate as a model, established a whole-life-cycle-assessment model to exploit the optimum economic thickness, and further evaluated the energy-saving rate, economic benefits, the greenhouse-gas emissions, etc. Besides, we compared the super-insulated aerogel with four commonly-used insulation materials, i.e., expanded polystyrene, extruded polystyrene, foamed polyurethane, and glass fibers. Experimental results showed that aerogel had the minimum optimum thickness of 3.7 mm. When aerogel was implemented with the optimum thickness, the annual cooling and the heating load for the hollow shale brick building were reduced by 7.5% and 18.2%, respectively. Additionally, compared with the other materials, aerogel achieved a faster reduction for greenhouse-gas emissions as the thickness increased. The aerogel insulation could lead to lower carbon emissions, e.g., CO2 (8.169 kg/(m2yr)) emissions with LPG fuel, and thus would be more preferable for environmental protection. The building energy simulations employed can be further strengthened in the future by considering the effect of urban microclimates and actual internal heat gains in offices. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aerogel; Energy conservation; Greenhouse gas emissions; Humid subtropical climate; Thermal insulation","Aerogels; Climate models; Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Historic preservation; Insulating materials; Life cycle; Liquefied petroleum gas; Office buildings; Polystyrenes; Tropics; Building energy conservation; Building energy simulations; Energy-saving rates; Expanded polystyrene; Extruded polystyrenes; Insulation materials; Subtropical climates; Thermal insulation materials; Thermal insulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072776944

Nitrogen deposition is declining or is projected to decline in many regions due to the reduction of N-compound emissions. It remains unknown whether the cessation of N deposition will have legacy effects on plant nutrient stoichiometry. If there are stoichiometric legacy effects at the community-level from prior N enrichment, the contribution of changes in community composition relative to the stoichiometric responses of individual functional groups in driving these changes is unknown. Methods: We measured plant N:P ratio at both functional group level and community level in a temperate steppe in three consecutive years following cessation of a 7-year N addition experiment with a wide-range of total amount added N in which the total amount of N added ranged from 0 to 350 g m−2. Results: The total amount of N addition was positively correlated with tall rhizomatous grass productivity and negatively correlated with tall bunchgrass productivity. Plant N:P ratios at both functional group and community levels did not change across N addition gradient. Community composition shifts contributed less than intra-group variation to the total variation of community level nutrient status in response to historic N addition. Conclusions: Our results indicated that biological N:P imbalance in response to N deposition can be rapidly ameliorated after the cessation of N deposition. Such legacy effects of N deposition on plant nutrient status are largely driven by the changes of nutrient status of individual plants instead of N-induced shifts in community composition. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Community composition; Ecological stoichiometry; Ecosystem recovery; Intra-specific variation; N:P ratio; Nitrogen recovery; Plant functional traits","community composition; functional group; grass; grassland; interspecific variation; plant community; soil nutrient; stoichiometry; temperate environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075557978

This study investigates the energy conservation and emission reduction effects of China's carbon dioxide (CO2) ETS pilot policy implemented in 2011. Based on panel data of the two-digit industry at province level from 2005 to 2015, we adopt the difference-in-differences (DID) model to examine the effects of the CO2 ETS on energy conservation and emission reduction. The results show that the CO2 ETS decreases the energy consumption of the regulated industries in pilot areas by 22.8% and the CO2 emissions by 15.5% compared to those in nonpilot areas. Further analysis indicates that the policy effects are mainly driven by improving technical efficiency and adjusting industrial structure. In addition, we find that the CO2 ETS performs better in areas with high levels of environmental enforcement and marketization. Overall, our findings suggest that the CO2 ETS has achieved energy conservation and emission reduction effects in developing countries. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO2; Emission reduction; Emission trading scheme; Energy conversation","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Developing countries; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Public utilities; Telecommunication industry; Carbon emission trading; Difference-in-differences; Emission reduction; Emission trading scheme; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Energy conversation; Environmental development; Environmental enforcement; Emission control; carbon dioxide; developing world; emission control; emissions trading; energy conservation; environmental economics; industrial production; marketing; policy implementation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076056804

As a carbon source, cellulose can be degraded and utilized by fungi. Carbon sources, which act as nutrients, not only provide energy but also serve as regulators of gene expression, metabolism and growth, through various signalling networks that enable cells to sense and adapt to varying environmental conditions. Nutrient-sensing pathways prioritize the use of preferred carbon sources and regulate the production of cellulose-degrading enzymes when necessary. Understanding the regulation of the fungal cellulolytic response will become increasingly important because we strive to increase the efficiency of the utilization of these renewable energy sources. Here, we show that Glsnf1, a sucrose-nonfermenting serine–threonine-protein kinase 1 (Snf1)/AMP-activated protein kinase homologue in medicinal macro basidiomycete Ganoderma lucidum, actively responds to carbon alterations and positively regulates cellulase activity and cellulase-related gene transcription. The carbon catabolite repressor CreA, a zinc binuclear cluster transcription factor that mediates the sensing of nutrients and suppression of the transcription of a number of genes necessary for the consumption of a less preferred carbon source, participates in the Glsnf1-mediated regulation of cellulases. Glsnf1 not only negatively regulates the transcription level of the CreA gene but also hinders its localization in the nucleus. Overall, our findings reveal a key nutrient-sensing mechanism that is critical for the modulation of carbon source adaptation in G. lucidum. © 2019 Society for Applied Microbiology and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",,"carbon; cellulase; cellulose; creatinase; fungal protein; hydrolase; protein serine threonine kinase; carbohydrate metabolism; drug effect; Ganoderma lucidum; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Carbon; Cellulase; Cellulose; Fungal Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Reishi; Ureohydrolases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074651351

Herein, we provided a novel approach to prepare 2D flexible electrode which was composed of glass fabric coated with tannin derived carbon (GFTC). In this strategy, each glass fiber with outstanding mechanical flexibility in the center was served as support and the outer ultrathin carbon coating derived from tannin play the role of active material, forming the coaxial structure. Two pieces of as-prepared GFTC with the highest specific capacitance of 315.7 mF cm− 2 were assembled into a 2D all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitor (ASSC) which possessed the largest energy density of 6.03 μWh cm− 2 and the superior cycling stability with 93% capacitance retention after 10,000 cycles at 2 mA cm− 2. Furthermore, the 2D ASSC realized practical application by coordinating with solar panels as a power supply. More importantly, this strategy can also be extended to prepare 1D flexible electrode by using glass yarn as support instead of glass fabric. The assembled 1D ASSC could be used as a wristband to be applied in wearable electronics. Thus, this work shows a new way to fabricate 1D/2D flexible electrodes and SCs with high performance for next-generation energy storage devices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon materials; Coaxial structure; Energy storage devices; Glass fiber; Tannin","Capacitance; Electrodes; Energy storage; Flavonoids; Glass fibers; Tannins; All-solid-state supercapacitors; Capacitance retention; Carbon material; Coaxial structures; Flexible electrodes; Mechanical flexibility; Six-membered rings; Specific capacitance; Supercapacitor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076210139

Many promising interactions occur between sustainable cities and communities (SDG 11), clean water and sanitation (SDG 6) and affordable and clean energy (SDG 7), which sit at the centre of integrated urban planning and regeneration. In this paper, we consider the framing and findings of four policies we have evaluated as natural experiments, all of which have important co-benefits, which were not always the focus of the initial policies. These policies are: the installation of cycleways and walkways in existing suburbs; a central government measure to recentralise employment after the 2011 Christchurch earthquakes; the streamlining of housing developments by reducing land-use regulation; and ongoing changes of policy about public housing investment. We show that having a clear understanding of the benefits of increased physical activity for health, for example, could accelerate the reduction of carbon emissions. Also, decisions about infrastructure, housing and job locations can generate health and environmental gains if supported by broader public transport investments. Cycling and walking are also more likely to substitute for short habitual car trips. Similarly, measuring the co-benefits of differential residential models, relating to land-use and renewable energy, provides a framework that can facilitate learning from policy interventions, enabling wider and potentially more rapid generalisation of policies, including those for climate change mitigation. © 2019","Climate change mitigation; Co-benefits; Cycling; Housing; Natural experiments; SDGs; Urban policy","Carbon; Climate models; Economics; Health; Housing; Investments; Land use; Sustainable development; Urban planning; Climate change mitigation; Co benefits; Cycling; Natural experiment; SDGs; Urban policy; Climate change; carbon; carbon emission; climate change; cycle transport; emission control; mitigation; urban development; urban planning; urban policy; walking; air pollution control; Article; climate change; earthquake; environmental decision making; environmental health; environmental policy; environmental sustainability; experiment; housing; land use; New Zealand; physical activity; priority journal; renewable energy; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; urban area; walkability; New Zealand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073262718

The kMatrix big data analytical tool is a unique research methodology, providing market intelligence for “hard to measure” markets. The kMatrix method was applied to the Climate Services sector to define, measure and forecast the current and potential future market volume of the sector. The MARCO definition of Climate Services was developed by using an existing kMatrix Weather & Climate Services dataset, which was then scrutinized by the MARCO partners and a distinct and extended Climate Services taxonomy developed.

Green building programs such as LEED incorporate design strategies that, if applied proactively, could enhance community resilience and public health by reducing the adverse effects of climatic events, particularly in vulnerable neighborhoods. Methods: This exploratory spatial and ecological analysis assessed the spatial correlation between protective green building strategies and neighborhood-level vulnerability to two climatic events — extreme heat and flooding — in Austin, TX, and Chicago, IL, from 2001 to 2012. Results: In both locations, the frequency analysis found far fewer occurrences of LEED certified projects in neighborhoods with high densities of vulnerable populations. The hot spot and spatial autocorrelation analyses found no spatial correlation between clusters of protective green building strategies and clusters of vulnerable populations. Conclusions: Green building projects were not used in Austin or Chicago from 2001 to 2012 as a tool to reduce neighborhood vulnerability to the health and environmental effects of two high-risk climatic events: extreme heat and flooding. However, green building design, construction, and operations and maintenance projects could use local vulnerability maps and spatial analysis techniques to support decisions prioritizing strategies that simultaneously reduce GHG emissions and protect building occupants from exposure to climatic events. Similarly, local policymakers could use spatial analysis to prioritize protective built environment policies in the neighborhoods where they would do the most good. © 2019 The Author(s)","Climate change vulnerability; Ecological analysis; Flooding; Green building; Heat; Spatial analysis","Architectural design; Climate change; Ecology; Environmental design; Floods; Greenhouse gases; Health; Health risks; Heating; Oil well flooding; Ecological analysis; Extreme weather events; Green building programs; Green building projects; Green buildings; Operations and maintenance; Spatial analysis; Spatial autocorrelation analysis; Spatial variables measurement; building construction; climate change; decision making; design; ecological approach; extreme event; flooding; greenspace; high temperature; neighborhood; spatial analysis; vulnerability; Austin [Texas]; Chicago; Illinois; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075040487

European organic production standards regulate these systems. As well as calculating the system’s emissions, this method also takes into account the soil carbon sequestration values. In this sense, the study of carbon sequestration in organic systems is of great interest from a legislation viewpoint. The results reveal that the farms producing meat cattle with calves sold at weaning age provide the highest levels of carbon footprint (16.27 kg of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2eq)/kg of live weight), whereas the farms with the lowest levels of carbon emissions are montanera pig and semi-extensive dairy goat farms, i.e., 4.16 and 2.94 kg CO2eq/kg of live weight and 1.19 CO2eq/kg of fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM), respectively. Enteric fermentation represents 42.8% and 79.9% of the total emissions of ruminants’ farms. However, in pig farms, the highest percentage of the emissions derives from manure management (36.5%-42.9%) and animal feed (31%-37.7%). The soil sequestration level has been seen to range between 419.7 and 576.4 kg CO2eq/ha/year, which represents a considerable compensation of carbon emissions. It should be noted that these systems cannot be compared with other more intensive systems in terms of product units and therefore, the carbon footprint values of dehesa organic systems must always be associated to the territory. © 2020 by the authors.

However, there is limited praxis scholarship on the ways public health departments are planning for climate risks and how they navigate these challenges. This case study provides insights into the incremental strategies employed by public health professionals to address climate risks in Florida. The paper examines pilot adaptation projects proposed by county public health departments and supported by the Building Resilience Against Climate Effects program. We qualitatively evaluated eight projects through document reviews and interviews with state program administrators and project managers at the county level. Dedicated program funding developed evidenced-based platforms which informed traditional and experimental responses that directly or indirectly addressed climate-related hazards. Increasing the funding amounts to support pilot projects would help to move beyond the preparatory groundwork stage to broader and more sustained adaptation actions.

Various studies indicate an increased willingness to pay (WTP) for the additional attribute of price fairness. Nevertheless, market shares have been low so far. The purpose of this paper is to discuss three possible reasons for this: low reference prices, socially desirable responses in choice experiments and the lack of justification of the claim “fair” by further attributes. Design/methodology/approach: In a split sample, one group facing alternatives with a higher price range and the other with a lower price range, the consumer’s choices are examined. This study uses a social desirability scale for controlling biases in the stated WTP. In addition, the claim “fair” is complemented with a guaranteed price, grazing, regional production and CO2-reduction. A random parameter logit model specified in WTP space is employed to estimate milk consumers’ (n=480) preferences for “fair” milk. Furthermore, a latent class approach reveals information about the source of preference heterogeneity for fair milk attributes among the two groups of the split sample. Findings: This study finds statistically significant differences between the two price ranges. In the low price range, additional attributes can trigger an additional WTP. In the high price range, there is no statistically significant additional WTP. WTP’s dependence on price levels could explain why the market share for “fair” milk has so far been low. Originality/value: This paper contributes to the study of the effect of split samples in choice experiments. In addition, it promotes the understanding of price fairness in milk and its determinants. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Discrete choice experiment; Marketing; Milk; Price fairness; Reference prices",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075581911

In this study, we investigated how stakeholders from important Blue Economy sectors along the German North Sea coast perceive the impacts of climate change on their daily work life and the growth of the Blue Economy. In a two-stage approach we first conducted two stakeholder workshops with representatives from the regional sea food sector, science, NGOs and local authorities, in order to identify important issues linked to climate change affecting environment, society, economy and policy. In the second stage, we conducted semi-structured interviews with key knowledge holders from the Blue Economy, to evaluate and validate the most important issues identified during the first stage, and the impacts on the respective sectors. The workshop participants identified perceptible effects of climate change on their marine environment. Early career scientists showed that they possess a clear focus on measures for climate change adaptation, transdisciplinary approaches and knowledge transfer. The interviews revealed that the climate change effects could be perceived as both negative and positive, depending on the sector. Other issues, especially political decisions and developments are perceived to have a greater immediate impact on the Blue Economy than the slow progress of climate change effects. Additionally, increased human activities, in the form of new or intensified uses like marine renewable energy generation, have a greater influence and lead to conflicts between the Blue Economy sectors. Our study showed that economic and societal stakeholders in Germanys North Sea region are aware of climate change and already perceive its effects on their businesses. Synergies and conflicts between the sectors and political decisions might influence sustainable growth of the Blue Economy in highly contested regions, such as the North Sea basin, much stronger than the effects of climate change. This calls for a more flexible and adaptive approach to policymaking, taking into account the changing environmental, social and economic realities. © Copyright © 2020 Hoerterer, Schupp, Benkens, Nickiewicz, Krause and Buck.","adaptation; aquaculture; blue growth; fisheries; North Sea; seafood; tourism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078802708

Therefore, the hybrid electrical vehicle Vehicle electrical hybrid (VEH) is a possible approach to improve the vehicle components or its architecture to maximize system efficiency. This vehicle benefits from levels of consumption and emission of pollutants lower than the thermal vehicle. The problem is then to find the right split power between the two hybrid sources, the internal combustion engine (ICE) and the electrical machines (EM) to minimize fuel consumption. These energy management strategies are the algorithms that achieve instant split power between the two sources in the hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) while controlling the battery state of charge (SOC), in order to improve the fuel economy and optimize the performance HEV. In this research, a parametric study on the impact of optimization of the energy management strategy on the optimal operation of the vehicle is presented. A hybrid vehicle model is described and rules-based energy management strategy is presented. Later these rules are optimized with an optimization algorithm based on Grey Wolf optimizer (GWO). It is a new meta-heuristic based on the population. The results of the simulation make it possible to deduce the impact of this optimal strategy of energy management on fuel consumption and CO2 emissions. The obtained results show that the optimal operation of the vehicle varies according to the best energy management strategies. © The Author(s) 2019.","fuel consumption; Grey wolf optimizer; hybrid vehicle model; optimization algorithm; rules-based energy management; Vehicle electric hybrid VEH","Automotive industry; Battery management systems; Charging (batteries); Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fuel consumption; Fuel economy; Fuels; Internal combustion engines; Optical variables measurement; Optimization; Pollution; Battery state of charge; Energy management strategies; Hybrid electrical vehicle; Optimization algorithms; Optimization control; Optimizers; Rules based; Vehicle applications; Hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076546977

(a) The processes and strategies to mitigate the effects of projected climate changes arising from global anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions, and (b) the future security of food, water, and energy specifically in the Arab Middle East. It is appreciated that implementation of these changes will be dependent on peaceful and politically stable conditions. Also, the Region is connected to neighbouring countries and shares the atmosphere with the rest of the world so there is a need for concerted multilateral action. All forward projections are subject to numerous uncertainties including the advent of conceptually new forms of disruptive technology and the adaptive capacity of Arab nations. Although the timing and quantification of risks are unclear, a prudent approach is essential to safeguard financial stability of international markets and national economies. Background information is presented on greenhouse gases, fossil fuels, and renewable energy. Climate-change predictions at the general level and specifically for the Arab region are outlined, along with mitigation and adaption strategies and climate engineering. Specific processes and strategies for the Arab Middle East are discussed with detailed proposals for agriculture and food security, water security, energy security, industrial biotechnology, social development, carbon storage and trading, and global biodiversity.

Increasingly, and very often on the basis of conflicting and/or weak evidence, the introduction of green infrastructure (GI) is seen as a win–win solution to urban air pollution, reducing ground-level concentrations without imposing restrictions on traffic and other polluting activities. The impact of GI on air quality is highly context dependent, with models suggesting that GI can improve urban air quality in some situations, but be ineffective or even detrimental in others. Here we set out a novel conceptual framework explaining how and where GI can improve air quality, and offer six specific policy interventions, underpinned by research, that will always allow GI to improve air quality. We call GI with unambiguous benefits for air quality GI4AQ. However, GI4AQ will always be a third-order option for mitigating air pollution, after reducing emissions and extending the distance between sources and receptors. © 2019, The Author(s).","Air pollution; Air quality; Green infrastructure; Urban environment","air quality; atmospheric pollution; conceptual framework; infrastructure; urban atmosphere; urban ecosystem; urban planning; air pollutant; air pollution; human; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063088604

Around three quarters of all new homes in the UK are currently built speculatively by the developer-led private housing sector. However, demand for self-build housing is growing. Concurrently, there is also a need to address the sustainability of homes, which represent 29% of final energy consumption in the UK. There is a clear imperative to develop business models within the construction sector in which both social and environmental sustainability are inherent. The aim of this paper is to explore professional and expert opinions on the suitability of group self-build housing as a development model for zero carbon homes. A Policy Delphi study was conducted both at a national level in England and at a regional level in South West England. In this iterative, non-contact research method, online questionnaires were used to gather data from the same panellists over three rounds. Panellists were drawn from seven groups: public sector, specialist groups/experts, housing associations, housing developers, designers, contractors, and financial institutions. The findings highlight that the panellists believe that group self-build is well suited as a development model for the delivery of zero carbon homes and sustainable communities.

Equilibrium Intra-ID can be estimated from calculated reduced partition function ratios (RPFR or β factor), which are largely absent to date. For relatively small molecules, the PS β factor can be calculated directly. However, estimating the PS β factor considering an entire, large organic molecule is computationally prohibitive. The isotope effect is local in that the vibrational frequencies of an atom are only affected by its proximal bonding environment. Therefore, the cutoff calculation, which simplifies the calculation of an entire molecule to a local area, was previously proposed for large organic molecules. However, the cutoff size was not validated, which has hindered the application of the cutoff calculation. Here, we calculated a series of small organic molecules with 2–18 carbon atoms to test the influence of cutoff size on the 13β value estimation of a target carbon position in a carbon chain or a carbon ring. We calculated nineteen small molecules that have a methyl carbon and a functional group that is at least three bonds away from the target methyl position. The result showed that the equilibrium 13C enrichment of the methyl group relative to CO2 at 25 °C (ln13α(eq)) for the nineteen molecules varied in a small range, with a standard deviation of 0.2‰. Fourteen aromatic hydrocarbons with a benzene and one adjacent functional group were calculated to test the influence of different adjacent functional groups on similar carbon positions in benzene. The results showed that different adjacent functional groups had significant influence only on the predicted ln13α(eq) value of the carbon position directly connected to them (standard deviation = 1.0‰, n = 14), with a negligible influence on the predicted ln13α(eq) value of the remaining carbons in benzene (standard deviation = 0.2‰, n = 14).

Production of advanced high-strength steel (AHSS) and wrought aluminum (Al) have average cradle-to-gate GHG emissions of 3.9 and 17.5 kg CO2eq/kg. Lightweighting benefits for eleven passenger car models over five driving cycles (including real-world and regulatory cycles) were determined. Lightweighting using AHSS to replace conventional steel has cradle-to-grave GHG savings in all cases, mainly attributed to savings in material use. Wrought Al has a much higher GHG production burden than AHSS and requires greater fuel savings in the use phase to achieve net cradle-to-grave GHG savings. Maximum GHG savings occur with Al versus AHSS in cases where the powertrain is resized, travel is congested, or lifetime travel distance is long. A typical Beijing peak-hour driving cycle with low speed and frequent stop-and-go has higher fuel reduction values (FRVs) and GHG savings than other cycles.

Understanding the origin that determines the faradaic efficiency (FE) of reduction of CO2 to CO is critical for developing a highly efficient electrocatalyst. Here, by constructing a single-atom Ni catalyst on nitrogen-doped winged carbon nanofiber (NiSA-NWC), we find that the single-atom Ni catalyst possesses the maximum CO FE of over 95% at-1.6 V vs Ag/AgCl, which is about 30% higher than the standard Ni nanoparticles on the same support. The Tafel analysis reveals that the single-atom Ni catalyst has a preferred reduction of CO2 to CO and a slower rate for the hydrogen evolution reaction. We propose that the domination of singular Ni1+ electronic states and limited hydrogen atom adsorption sites on the single-atom Ni catalyst lead to the observed high FE for CO2 reduction to CO.

Models to predict λeff are required in diverse global and community land surface schemes as well as climate models to investigate coupled water and heat transport in soils and heat exchange at the earth surface. Among the many soil thermal conductivity models, models based on the normalized concept are most often developed and utilized for estimating λeff. However, at present no systematic study has been performed to investigate the origin and evolution of the normalized thermal conductivity models, nor to evaluate their performance with large datasets. The objectives of this study were to: (a) review the development and evolution of the normalized thermal conductivity models, and (b) assess their performance with datasets consisting of soils with a full range of water saturation and a wide range of soil textures and bulk densities. A total of 38 normalized thermal conductivity models were critically reviewed and their relationships were clearly outlined. Their performance was evaluated by five categories according to model characteristics with a compiled dataset consisting of 71 soils and 669 tests collected from nine studies. Our analysis demonstrated key roles of the quartz content, solid thermal conductivity and choice of the Kersten functions in the model applicability and accuracy of estimating λeff. The results showed that the Y2018, CK2005, CK2006, J1975, L2007 and T2009 models have the best performance among the models without fitting parameters, but further improvements are required to apply them universally. Although the models of H2017, LD2015, M2006 and K2007 are the best performing models with fitting parameters, approaches to calculate these parameters are required so they can be easily applied. Future studies on parametrization of currently well-performing models for wider and more accurate application, development of a soil thermal conductivity database for model evaluation and calibration purposes, and connecting soil thermal conductivity models to hydraulic properties are recommended. Highlights: The history and evolution of normalized thermal conductivity models and the potential Kersten (Ke) functions are collated and synthesized. A total of 38 models were reviewed and their performance was evaluated with a total of 71 soils and 669 tests from nine studies. The Y2018, CK2005, CK2006, J1975, L2007 and T2009 are the best ranked models without fitting parameters.

As a method of phytoremediation to mitigate this risk, roadside plants show significant potential to remove PM from the air. However, the relationship between traffic pressure, height, and leaves’ capturing capacity is rarely reported. In this study, two common effective roadside plants (Hedera helix, Taxus baccata) with typical leaf shapes (broad and needle-leaved) were selected to explore the foliage capacity under high, middle and low traffic burden. A green wall covered by H. helix was tested to find out the relationship between heights and the amount of accumulated PM. Although the PM capturing capacity varied between different traffic pressures, needle-leaved species generally accumulated more PM than broad-leaved species. For PM10 capturing, needle-leaved species showed higher capacity under all traffic pressures except under the low traffic pressure. For PM2.5 capturing, needle-leaved species accumulated more PM only under the high traffic pressure. Needle-leaved plants were more sensitive to the change of traffic pressures, its PM capturing capacity changed notably between different traffic pressures because its leaf wax is more susceptible to be corroded. Leaf surface contact angle was slightly affected by the change of traffic pressure for broad-leaved species, but for needle-leaved species, it changed greatly. Leaf surface was the main zone for large PM capturing because the large PM was more likely to be stuck in grooves on the leaf surface, while leaf wax was mainly for fine PM absorption because PM with small sizes could adhere to the surface of the wax crystal. By comparing the amount of captured PM by leaf surface of urban roadside plants under different traffic pressures and height ranges, this study optimizes the benefits of roadside plants as traffic-related PM filter under different traffic conditions. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Airborne particulate matter; green wall; traffic pressure","air pollutant; bioremediation; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; plant; plant leaf; Air Pollutants; Biodegradation, Environmental; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Plant Leaves; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071638753

However, claims that it is “too late” to act or that societal collapse is “inevitable,” must be challenged, particularly in the context of Pacific Small Island Developing States (PSIDS). Here, the serious impacts of sea-level rise may already be unavoidable, but ongoing global mitigation efforts are essential to avoid further catastrophic impacts. First, narratives of despair reinforce social distancing in ways that make it harder to assert claims of shared responsibility for past climate injustices and mutual obligations in the future. Second, claims that it too late to avoid societal collapse overlook significant adaptation efforts already initiated by PSIDS, particularly those led by women and youth, which are informed by distinctive community values of Vai Nui or Fonofale (interconnected well-living). These values have sustained PSIDS societies through traumatic histories of colonization, racism, and violence, and are still positioned to support communities suffering now, and when facing future risks.

As mangroves expand their range limit, leading edge individuals are more likely to experience an increased incidence of freeze events. However, we still lack a clear understanding of the mechanisms used by mangroves to survive freezing conditions. Here, we conducted common garden experiments at different locations experiencing variable winter freeze conditions to show glycine betaine, an organic osmolyte, increases significantly with freeze exposure, playing an important role in the freeze tolerance of Avicennia germinans, a widespread Neotropical mangrove. We found glycine betaine accumulation was similar across all source populations and freeze exposure locations, suggesting glycine betaine is not a range limit adaptation and is instead used for freeze tolerance by A. germinans irrespective of source population. Plants sourced from populations that experience freezing conditions exhibited greater rates of survival, indicating range edge populations of A. germinans have other heritable adaptations in addition to glycine betaine for freeze tolerance. Synthesis. Continued mangrove expansion poleward will result in a greater incidence of freeze events for individuals at the leading edge. Our findings suggest freeze tolerance in this species may be genetically based and that leading edge A. germinans have the potential to survive extreme freeze events and recover post-freeze, allowing for their continued expansion poleward. This process of selective survival may act to promote adaptation of freeze tolerance in range edge populations. © 2019 The Authors.

However, its contribution to gender empowerment in diverse farming households is not documented. This study creates a Gender Empowerment Index for climate-smart villages (GEI-CSV) based on four major measurable indicators—political, economic, agricultural, and social. The gender gap was derived by mapping difference in empowerment levels across selected CSVs and non-CSVs. These indicators can be used as a vital tool to understand the process of gender empowerment that can trigger the entry points to achieve gender equality, which is also an important aspect in the adoption of climate-smart agriculture practices (CSAPs). The study measures empowerment at the inter-household and intra-household level across CSVs and non-CSVs from the individual household survey with both female and male members of the same household. This paper provides evidence demonstrating how gender empowerment differs in CSVs and non-CSVs from selected climate-smart villages (community-based approach) in two contrasting ecologies and socio-economic settings of India. The study documents the existing gender gap in CSVs and non-CSVs across India’s western (Haryana) and eastern (Bihar) Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP). Irrespective of CSVs and non-CSVs, considerable differences in outlook and gender gap were observed between Bihar and Haryana. Both women and men in Bihar are less empowered than they are in Haryana. High empowerment level in CSVs than non-CSVs shows that the concept of CSVs has brought a change towards knowledge and capacity enhancement of both women and men farmers promoting gender equality in farming households with a varying scope of interventions made and required for scaling CSAPs across the diversity of farming households. © 2018, The Author(s).",,"Agriculture; Ecology; Surveys; Capacity enhancement; Community based approach; Gender equality; Household level; Household surveys; Indo-Gangetic Plains; Smart agricultures; Socio-economics; Rural areas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056617389

Resilient capacity planning concept implementation will help local community to reduce impact of climate change and disaster risk, and also increase safety management. The research is intended to measure the resilience of urban system according to sustainable development for historical heritage and resilient approach that has applied in vernacular settlement. Vernacular architecture of Lampung is a suitable example for this research. Lampung is an area that has multi-culture acculturation, which is seen, in the social system of society, cultural patterns, building typologies and traditional settlement patterns. On the other hand, vernacular architecture of Lampung provides outstanding shelter from climate change and disaster risk, meets the requirements of local food security, where the development adjusts the cultural landscape, the potential of food sources and other natural resources. In addition, the development process also uses local technology and construction that adapts the environment and its location to ease the production land. However, there is much vernacular architecture, which have high socio-cultural potential and are not identified by academic researchers. By studying architectural vernacular, we not only repeat the way of life of the past, but also as a first step to create new technologies and designs in the future by learning the knowledge and technology applied in the past especially in Lampung.

Though making significant progress toward the maximum possible use of clean, renewable forms of energy, such as hydro, thermal, solar, and wind power, it will take a long time before China can completely abandon the use of fossil fuels. In this paper, using Fuyang City in Anhui Province as a case study, a four-dimensional differential equation model, based on the consumption, price, economic growth, and “ecological civilization construction” of natural gas energy, is developed, which incorporates concepts and calculations of natural gas energy intensity, “natural gas ecological civilization intensity,” and “economic ecological civilization intensity.” It is the first attempt ever made to quantify the construction of urban ecological civilization and discuss the evolutionary relationship among the internal variables of the system. Regression analysis, data fitting, neural network, and other methods are used to confirm the parameters of the system model. Through Matlab simulation of each variable and using an evolution map, a quantitative understanding of the role of natural gas is generated. The research findings reveal that paying attention to the environmental aspects of energy consumption is beneficial to economic growth. The paper concludes that, at present, the best ways for China to reduce its carbon emissions are to implement a market price and peak–valley prices for natural gas, improve the tiered price mechanism, appropriately reduce the economic growth rate, continue to adjust the industrial structure away from heavy industry, and scientifically manage the natural gas energy system. These reforms are of great practical significance in working toward a sustainable development path for the city. © Copyright © 2020 Hao, Li and Xia.","differential equation; economic ecological civilization intensity; natural gas; natural gas ecological civilization intensity; natural gas energy intensity","Carbon; Differential equations; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Industrial economics; Industrial emissions; MATLAB; Natural gas; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Wind power; Differential equation model; Economic growth rate; Environmental aspects; Evolutionary relationships; Industrial structures; Natural gas energy; Strategic development; Urban energy systems; Fossil fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078080291

The results obtained show that, although the climate warming will reduce the future heating energy demand, an improvement of buildings' energy performance will still be necessary to increase sustainability and ensure their continued use. Natural ventilation would suffice to prevent overheating in the studied location, but a further analysis is needed for warmer alpine regions.

It examines both the impact of coins and of banknotes. In addition, it identifies areas within the cash payment system where the impact on the environment and on the climate can be reduced. Methods: The ReCiPe endpoint (H) impact method was used for this LCA. The cash payment system has been divided into five subsystems: the production of banknotes, the production of coins, the operation phase, the end of life of banknotes and the end of life of coins. Two functional units were used: (1) cumulative cash payments in the Netherlands in 2015 and (2) the average single cash payment in the Netherlands in 2015. Input data for all processes within each subsystem was collected through interviews and literature study. Ten key companies and authorities in the cash payment chain contributed data, i.e. the Dutch central bank, the Royal Dutch Mint, a commercial bank, a cash logistic service provider, two cash-in-transit companies, two printing works, an ATM manufacturer and a municipal waste incinerator. Results and discussion: The environmental impact of the Dutch cash payment system in 2015 was 2.42 MPt (expressed in eco points) and its global warming potential (GWP) was 19 million kg CO2 equivalents (CO2e). For an average single cash transaction, the environmental impact was 654 μPt and the GWP was 5.1 g CO2e. The operation phase (e.g. energy use of ATMs, transport of banknotes and coins) (64%) and coin production phase (31%) had the largest impact on the environment, while the operation phase also had the largest impact on climate change human health (89%) and climate change ecosystems (56%). Finally, scenario analysis shows that reductions of the environmental impact (47%) and the impact on climate change (50%) could be achieved by implementing a number of measures, namely reducing the number of ATMs, stimulating the use of renewable energy in ATMs, introducing hybrid trucks for cash transport and matching coins with other countries in the euro area. Conclusions: This is the first study that investigates the environmental impact and GWP of the cash payment system in the Netherlands, by taking both the impact of banknotes and coins into account. The total environmental impact of cash payments in 2015 was 2.42 MPt and their GWP was 19 million kg CO2e. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Banknotes; Cash payment system; Coins; Environmental impact; GWP; LCA","carbon dioxide; Article; bank account; cash payment; climate change; controlled study; economic aspect; environmental change; environmental impact; greenhouse effect; human; life cycle assessment; municipal waste; Netherlands; priority journal; renewable energy; stakeholder engagement; traffic and transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068314794

Today, most of the population lives in the urban areas and the rapid growth entails more construction in a housing sector. Since the industrial revolution the world has experienced countless technological attainments and on the other hand risky increase in natural resources use, energy consumption, greenhouse gases emission, ozone depletion, toxification and global temperature rising. The question how the cities can respond to urban growth is related to the sustainable goals of Agenda 2030. This research discusses potential of the usage of timber as construction material and it also brings the answer to this question. The wood is 100% renewable, recyclable and nontoxic material with capacity to absorb CO2 and perform low embodied energy. The increase of timber use in the construction contributes to sustainable development and to the reduction of waste, CO2 emission, as well as energy consumption. The aim of this paper is to discuss the advantages of using timber as a sustainable solution in urban context, in comparison with most commonly used concrete. The findings demonstrate the value of timber as sustainable construction material. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Industrial emissions; Ozone layer; Population statistics; Sustainable development; Timber; Urban growth; Global temperatures; Greenhouse gases emissions; Housing sectors; Industrial revolutions; Non-toxic materials; Sustainable cities; Sustainable construction; Sustainable solution; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079651083

In moderate and cold climates, large amounts of fossil fuels are used for space heating and domestic hot water production in winter. Although on an annual base solar energy is available in large quantities in these regions, least of the solar resource is available in winter, when most of the energy is needed. Therefore, solutions are needed to store and transfer renewable energy from summer to winter. In this paper, a seasonal energy storage based on the aluminium redox cycle (Al3+ → Al → Al3+) is proposed. For charging, electricity from solar or other renewable sources is used to convert aluminium oxide or aluminium hydroxide to elementary aluminium (Al3+ → Al). In the discharging process, aluminium is oxidized (Al → Al3+), releasing hydrogen, heat, and aluminium hydroxide or aluminium oxide as a by-product. Hydrogen is used in a fuel cell to produce electricity. Heat produced from the aluminium oxidation process and by the fuel cell is used for domestic hot water production and space heating. The chemical reactions and energy balances are presented, and simulation results are shown for a system that covers the entire energy demand for electricity, space heating and domestic hot water of a new multi-family building with rooftop photovoltaic energy in combination with the seasonal Al energy storage cycle. It shows that 7–11 kWp of photovoltaic installations and 350–530 kg Al would be needed per apartment for different Swiss climates. Environmental life cycle data shows that the global warming potential and non-renewable primary energy consumption can be reduced significantly compared to today's common practice of heating with natural gas and using electricity from the ENTSO-E network. The presumptive cost were estimated and indicate a possible cost-competitiveness for this system in the near future. © 2019 The Authors","Aluminium redox cycle; Power-to-X; Seasonal energy storage","Alumina; Aluminum hydroxide; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Fuel cells; Global warming; Hot water distribution systems; Hydrogen; Life cycle; Redox reactions; Solar cells; Solar energy; Space heating; Water; Anthropogenic global warming; Environmental life cycle; Global warming potential; Photovoltaic installation; Power-to-X; Primary energy consumption; REDOX cycles; Seasonal energy storages; Aluminum oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077218772

In response to climatic changes, species around the world have already started to shift their ranges along altitudinal and latitudinal gradients. However, it remains unclear whether the areas currently managed for biodiversity protection are optimized for these shifting ranges. Climate velocities represent a method to quantify the rate at which organisms must alter their range to maintain their current climate envelope. Here we use a case study of the Southern Rockies region in the western United States to show how forward and backward climate velocities can be used to quantify potential impacts of climatic changes and delineate abiotic climate refugia. We further illustrate how climate velocities can integrate into a process that simultaneously identifies climate refugia for suites of species while accounting for additional landscape factors contributing to protected area success. These results demonstrate how potential climatic changes may be used to prioritize the efficient selection of climate refugia, potentially aiding multi-target climate adaptation decision-making across broad regions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change refugia; Climate velocity; Conservation planning; Protected areas; Southern rockies; Threatened species","altitude; biodiversity; climate change; conservation management; conservation planning; endangered species; environmental protection; latitudinal gradient; protected area; refugium; Rocky Mountains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075885045

M., Carpinus betulus L., and Diospyros lotus L. located near the afforested stands was selected as the control region. Fifteen forest floor and topsoil (0–15 cm) samples per site were taken and analyzed in the laboratory. In addition, the seasonal changes in the fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O were studied over a year. The quality of the forest floor differed among the sites, indicating the highest N, and the lowest C concentrations in the alder stand. The soil bulk density, pH, available nutrients (P, Ca, and Mg), earthworm activities and microbial biomass N were significantly higher in the alder stand with organic C being the least. The microbial biomass C did not differ among the studied sites, whereas the total N was significantly higher in the alder ≈ maple sites having the minimum C/N ratios. High contents of water were found in the DNF site. The highest CO2 (0.31 mg CO2 m− 2 d− 1) and N2O (0.42 mg N2O m− 2 d− 1) fluxes were observed in the DNF site. The CH4 flux showed higher amounts in the DNF ≈ cypress ≈ pine (0.12, 0.11 and 0.07 mg CH4 m− 2 d− 1, respectively) sites than in the maple ≈ alder (−0.05, and − 0.04 mg CH4 m− 2 d− 1, respectively) plantations. The highest values of all fluxes were measured in August, whereas the lowest were detected in February. This research recommends a plantation with suitable native broad-leaved species along with a forestation management plan to rehabilitate the forests of the DNF area. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Broad and needle-leaved; Forest floor quality; Global warming; Plantation; Soil fertility","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Reforestation; Soils; Available nutrients; Broad and needle-leaved; Earthworm activities; Forest floors; Greenhouse gas fluxes; Microbial biomass c; Plantation; Soil fertility; Floors; afforestation; broad-leaved forest; climate change; forest floor; global warming; land degradation; long-term change; optimization; plantation forestry; soil fertility; soil quality; Acer; Alnus; Biomass; Forestation; Pinus; Sites; Soil; Trees; Acer; Alnus; Alnus subcordata; Carpinus betulus; Cupressus; Cupressus sempervirens; Diospyros lotus; Parrotia persica; Pinus nigra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074799942

In this paper, the semiarid regions of China were selected as a research focus, and SOC data from 1980 to 2015 were analysed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20.0 software. SOC in farmland varied according to cultivated land type, mulching material type and planting method in the studied regions. The SOC content is 10.3–10.8 g kg−1 in supplementally irrigated land and flat dry land, 7.1–8.7 g kg−1 in terraced dry land and river beach land, and 6.2–6.4 g kg−1 in sloping dry land. The SOC content increased to 16.1–17.4 g kg−1 when crop stalks were used as mulch. The increase was only 11.5–13.5 g kg−1 in soils mulched with film or sandstone. The SOC value in wheat, maize and potatoes sown on single or double ridges was 2.4%–3.2%, 35.7%–36.4% and 4.4%–4.8%, respectively, which are higher than the values for wheat, maize and potatoes sown using the flat planting method. The SOC sequestering potential also varied according to the previously noted factors and was improved from 224.1% to 383.8% depending on cultivated land type, from 96.5% to 182.3% depending on mulching material type and from 96.1% to 191.3% depending on planting method. The SOC sequestering potential can be improved by 453.2%–757.4% with the integration of the optimal cultivated land type, mulching material type and planting method. Thus, there is substantial soil carbon sequestration potential in China's semiarid regions. © 2019 British Society of Soil Science","cultivation method; food security; greenhouse gases; semiarid regions; soil organic carbon","agricultural land; carbon sequestration; crop plant; cultivation; food security; mulching; organic carbon; semiarid region; soil carbon; China; Solanum tuberosum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073965947

Emphasis has always been on benefits of adaptation which includes showing resilience to increase food production, enhancing livelihood outcomes with less vulnerability, and reducing poverty. This project was undertaken to determine unintended maladaptive outcomes resulting from farmers’ adaptive strategies to climate variability. The project took place in rural southern Ghana with input from tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) growers from the Offinso North District. To mitigate adverse effects of climate variability on tomato productivity, adaptive strategies resulted in reduction in agro-biodiversity, release of greenhouse gas, pollution of nearby water, increasing soil acidity above the optimum requirement of tomato, adverse effects of household farm labor, increasing vulnerability of dependents, increasing pressure on social facilities, competition of crops for nutrients, moisture and sun light, and increase in spread of pests and diseases. Age, gender, formal education, farming experience, and access to extension services influenced farmers’ perceived maladaptive outcomes of adaptation strategies. Adaptation strategies to climate variability, if unchecked, can increase vulnerability, or erode, sustainable development opportunities for farmers in rural agroecological settings. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","climate variability; mixed-methods; Offinso North District; Solanum lycopersicum; southern Ghana",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060866411

It is a compliance approach that allows point sources, such as factories, to meet regulatory obligations by using pollutant reductions created by another source, such as local farms, which has lower pollution control costs. The objective of this study was to explore the possibility of expanding the use of WQT from agriculture to rural septic systems, an often-neglected nonpoint source of nutrients to Lake Erie. Septic system upgrades in northwestern Ohio are of special interest because the soil conditions in this area pose a limitation to the effectiveness of nutrient removal for conventional soil-based systems. We assessed the willingness of septic system users to upgrade their systems using three scenarios emphasizing climate change, governmental regulation, or WQT. We found that septic system users were most interested in upgrades under the WQT scenario. The idea of WQT was better accepted in certain locations where septic system users were more concerned about the environment, perceived the local water quality to be degraded, and were aware of the limitation of their septic systems. Pilot WQT projects should focus on approaching these users. © 2020, National Environmental Health Association.

In order to better understand the nitrogen biogeochemistry in coastal regions, spatiotemporal nitrogen fixation, denitrification and anammox were investigated in the coastal regions of northern Beibu Gulf (NBG), South China Sea (SCS). Nitrogen fixation was mainly detected in the water column of outer bays, attributed to the low nitrate concentration and low N/P (N/P < 16). Comparisons of the nitrogen fixation rates between unicellular (<10 mm) and the filamentous diazotrophs (>10 mm) indicated that the contribution of unicellular diazotrophs was more important than filamentous diazotrophs. Besides, field investigation revealed that Richelia was the dominant species in filamentous diazotrophs. On the other hand, both denitrification and anammox were found in the surface sediment and denitrification dominated the nitrogen loss process. Denitrification was mainly related to the nitrate concentration in pore water and organic matter in the sediment, while anammox was mainly regulated by the concentration of nitrate and nitrite in pore water. Additionally, temperature, dissolved oxygen (DO) and salinity also had an impact on denitrification and anammox. The net areal yield of nitrogen biogeochemical processes was estimated to be −1079t/a, as an important pathway of nitrogen removal. This study adds to the knowledge of nitrogen biogeochemistry in the nutrient-replete coastal region and highlights its significance in such an environment. © 2019","Anammox; Denitrification; Nitrogen fixation; Northern Beibu gulf","Biochemical oxygen demand; Biogeochemistry; Coastal zones; Denitrification; Dissolved oxygen; Nitrates; Nitrogen removal; Wastewater treatment; Water; ANAMMOX; Beibu gulfs; Biogeochemical process; Field investigation; Global carbon cycle; Nitrate concentration; Primary productivity; Spatiotemporal distributions; Nitrogen fixation; dissolved oxygen; nitrate; nitrite; nitrogen; organic matter; water; nitric acid derivative; nitrogen; oxygen; ammonium compound; anoxic conditions; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; coastal zone; concentration (composition); denitrification; nitrogen fixation; porewater; spatial distribution; surficial sediment; temporal distribution; anaerobic ammonium oxidation; Article; biogeochemical cycling; concentration (parameter); denitrification; diazotroph; nitrogen cycle; nonhuman; seashore; sediment; South China Sea; species; surface property; temperature; bay; carbon cycle; chemistry; China; cyanobacterium; metabolism; microbiology; nitrogen fixation; salinity; spatiotemporal analysis; Gulf of Tonkin; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea; Richelia; Bays; Carbon Cycle; China; Cyanobacteria; Denitrification; Nitrates; Nitrites; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Cycle; Nitrogen Fixation; Oxygen; Salinity; Spatio-Temporal Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071974460

Another consequence seems to be the general increase of temperature of the planet leading to climate changes and catastrophic extreme events. Thus, the possibility of reserves depletion and global environmental issues associated with its use are prompting the search for clean renewable energy sources, as well as the development of efficient and more robust energy storage systems. The most promising one for such a purpose is based on the splitting of water in a photosynthetic system to store the energy of Sun as hydrogen and oxygen. In order to realize such a technology, new more efficient electrocatalysts for oxygen and hydrogen evolution reaction based on single-atom catalysts, especially designed to exploit the maximum potentiality of the elements, are being developed, fueled by increasingly powerful theoretical modelling and characterization tools, thus paving broad roads towards a bright and sustainable society. The main advancements for preparation and characterization of such novel strategic materials are considered in this account. Furthermore, atomic scale modelling based on density functional theory is also discussed in the context of the unique electronic structure that leads to superior catalytic activity, highlighting its potential to advance this important scientific field. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Hydrogen evolution reaction; Oxygen evolution reaction; Single-atom catalyst; Synthesis; Theoretical modelling; Water splitting",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086969070

Among pollutants, particulate matter (PM) is especially relevant, as it may contain toxic metal ions that can reach the brain via olfactory pathways. Our purpose was to investigate the relation between atmospheric PM and olfactory identification performance in children. Using a validated method, we tested the olfactory identification performance of 120 children, 6-12 years old, from two locations in Mexico City: A focal group (n = 60) from a region with high PM levels and a control group of equal size and similar socioeconomic level from a region with markedly lower PM concentrations. Groups were matched for age and sex. Concentrations of manganese and lead in the hair of participants were determined as biomarkers of exposure. Daily outdoor PM levels were obtained from official records, and indoor PM levels were measured in the children's classrooms. Official records confirmed higher levels of outdoor PM in the focal region during the days of testing. We also found higher classroom PM concentrations at the focal site. Children from the focal site had on average significantly lower olfactory identification scores than controls, and hair analysis showed significantly higher levels of manganese for the focal children but no difference in lead. Children appear to be vulnerable to the effects of air pollution on olfactory identification performance, and metal-containing particles likely play a role in this. Olfactory tests provide a sensitive, noninvasive means to assess central nervous function in populations facing poor air quality. © 2019 The Author(s). Published by Oxford University Press.

O3 pollution was getting worse in Shanghai, with daily maximum O3 concentrations increasing at a rate of 2.47 ppb yr−1 in urban site. The climate penalty (mO3-T), defined as the slope of O3 change with increasing temperature, exhibited largest values in summer. Summertime O3 increased faster as temperature increased, with mean rates of 6.65 and 13.68 ppb °C−1, respectively in XJH and DT above 30 °C. Sensitivity experiments indicate that the temperature dependence of biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) emissions could be the main chemical driver of the high-temperature O3 response in summer, since the simulated mO3-T are most sensitive to changes of biogenic isoprene emissions. NOx emission reductions strengthened the high-temperature O3 response, with summer mean mO3-T values increasing from 1.52 ppb°C−1 during 2010–2012 to 2.97 ppb °C−1 during 2013–2017. As NOx emissions continue to decrease, the O3 production in urban Shanghai tend to become transitional and the dependence of mO3-T on the biogenic VOC emissions might be weakened. Model results suggest that anthropogenic VOC emission reductions would effectively relieve O3 pollution and reduce the sensitivity of O3 to increasing temperatures in urban Shanghai. Tailored emission reductions as well as scientific city planning strategies should be formulated to balance VOC/NOx ratios, so as to wrestle with the challenges for future O3 pollution under a warming climate. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric chemistry; Isoprene; Ozone; Shanghai; Temperature","Air pollution; Atmospheric chemistry; Climate change; Emission control; Isoprene; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Temperature; Temperature distribution; Urban growth; Volatile organic compounds; Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Emission reduction; High temperature; Increasing temperatures; Isoprene emission; Planning strategies; Shanghai; Temperature dependence; Atmospheric temperature; isoprene; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; anthropogenic source; atmospheric chemistry; biogenic emission; concentration (composition); isoprene; nitric oxide; Oceania Ecozone; ozone; temperature effect; urban area; urban pollution; volatile organic compound; air quality; Article; China; circadian rhythm; city planning; climate warming; high temperature; pollution; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); summer; temperature dependence; urban area; China; Chongming Island; Dongtan; Shanghai; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074773664

Atmospheric escape has an appreciable impact on the long-term climate evolution on terrestrial planets. Exothermic chemistry serves as an important mechanism driving atmospheric escape and the role of such a mechanism is of great interest for Titan due to its extremely complicated atmospheric and ionospheric composition. Aims. This study is devoted to a detailed investigation of neutral N and C escape on the dayside of Titan, which is driven by exothermic neutral-neutral, ion-neutral, and dissociative recombination (DR) reactions. It was carried out based on the extensive measurements of Titan's upper atmospheric structure by a number of instruments on board Cassini, along with an improved understanding of the chemical network involved. Methods. A total number of 14 C- and N-containing species are investigated based on 146 exothermic chemical reactions that release hot neutrals with nascent energies above their respective local escape energies. For each species and each chemical channel, the hot neutral production rate profile is calculated, which provides an estimate of the corresponding escape rate when combined with the appropriate escape probability profile obtained from a test particle Monte Carlo model. Results. Our calculations suggest a total N escape rate of 9.0 × 1023 s-1 and a total C escape rate of 4.2 × 1023 s-1, driven by exothermic chemistry and appropriate for the dayside of Titan. The former is primarily contributed by neutral-neutral reactions, whereas the latter is dominated by ion-neutral reactions; however, contributions from neutral-neutral and DR reactions to the latter cannot be ignored either. Our calculations further reveal that the bulk of N escape is driven by hot N(4S) production from the collisional quenching of N(2D) by ambient N2, while C escape is mainly driven by hot CH3 and CH4 production via a number of important ion-neutral and neutral-neutral reactions. Conclusions. Considered in the context of prior investigations of other known escape mechanisms, we suggest that exothermic chemistry is likely to contribute appreciably to non-thermal C escape on the dayside of Titan, although it plays an insignificant role in N escape. © ESO 2019.","Planets and satellites: atmospheres; Planets and satellites: individual: Titan","Atmospheric structure; Carbon; Dissociation; Ions; Nitrogen; Atmospheric escape; Chemical networks; Collisional quenching; Dissociative recombinations; Escape probability; Exothermic chemical reaction; Terrestrial planets; Test Particle Monte-Carlo; Atmospheric chemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094594394

The sample consisted of visitors to Missouri State Parks (n = 1775). Place attachment was measured using 12 items of place identity, place dependence, and social bonding. Exploratory factor analysis of climate friendly behavior items revealed two dimensions: Visit based (i.e., short-term, immediate actions individuals could take during their visit) and Big Picture (i.e., advocacy actions that suggest a long-term engagement with parks). A path analysis demonstrated that the dimensions of place attachment predict climate friendly behavior and support for climate friendly management action in different ways. Specifically, place identity increased climate friendly behavior (big picture) and place dependence increased both climate friendly behavior (visit based) and support for climate friendly management action. Findings from this study provided evidence for the importance of place attachment as a means for engaging visitors in climate-related actions both in and beyond the park setting. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Climate friendly behavior; Place attachment; State parks; Survey","Factor analysis; Regression analysis; Surveying; Climate change impact; Climate friendly behavior; Exploratory factor analysis; Park setting; Path analysis; Place attachment; Short term; Two-dimension; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; management practice; path analysis; survey method; adult; article; climate change; exploratory factor analysis; female; human; major clinical study; male; Missouri; path analysis; social bonding; factor analysis; recreation; Missouri; United States; Climate Change; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Humans; Missouri; Recreation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076213290

However, the effects of composting on carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilizing capacity in view of closing nutrient cycle are still poorly investigated. In this work, two FW anaerobic digestates from the wet (D1) and dry-batch process (D2), and their respective composts (C1 and C2) were tested in a soil incubation (84 days at 25 °C) to assess CO2 emissions in comparison with a mixed (animal slurry/energy crop) digestate (BD) and a reference municipal solid waste compost (MSWC). The same products were also tested for the relative P efficiency (RPE) in soil, in comparison with a chemical-P source (30 mg P kg−1). Lastly, the apparent recovery fraction of N (N-ARF) from the five organic products was determined in a pot test with ryegrass (84 days; 300 kg available N ha−1), compared to a chemical fertilizer (NPK). Composting strongly reduced net-CO2 emissions compared to the two digestates (625 vs. 2850 mg CO2 kg−1 soil). Oppositely, composting very modestly influenced RPE that ranged around 100–90% in D1 and C1, and ≈30% in D2 and C2. Moreover, composting did not significantly reduce N-ARF that ranked in descending order as follows: NPK (77.5%) &gt; D1 = BD (17.7%) ≥ C1 (14.7%) &gt; MSWC (3.6%) &gt; D2 (1.2%) &gt; C2 (−3.1%). Composting was shown a reliable strategy for FW digestate management, as it reduces potential CO2 emission without affecting these products' N- and P-fertilizing capacity. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Organic waste; Phosphorus fractionation; Relative phosphorus efficiency; Ryegrass","Batch data processing; Carbon dioxide; Composting; Efficiency; Fertilizers; Municipal solid waste; Soils; Apparent recovery; Carbon dioxide emissions; Chemical fertilizers; Municipal solid waste compost; Organic wastes; Phosphorus efficiencies; Phosphorus fractionation; Ryegrass; Anaerobic digestion; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; phosphorus; carbon dioxide; anaerobic digestion; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; compost; fertilizer; food waste; fractionation; grass; phosphorus; anaerobic digestion; Article; batch process; carbon footprint; composting; controlled study; electric conductivity; environmental planning; fertilizer application; food waste; incubation time; Lolium multiflorum; municipal solid waste; nonhuman; nutrient cycle; pH measurement; priority journal; temperature measurement; waste management; agriculture; air pollutant; anaerobic growth; composting; food; procedures; waste; Animalia; Lolium; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Anaerobiosis; Carbon Dioxide; Composting; Food; Waste Management; Waste Products",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071655151

Many organisms evolve responses to seasonal environmental cues to synchronize these key events with favourable conditions. Often the fitness consequences of each life history transition depend on previous and subsequent events in the life cycle. If so, shifts in environmental cues can create cascading effects throughout the life cycle, which can influence fitness, selection on life history traits, and population viability. We examined variation in cue responses for contingent life history expression and fitness in a California native wildflower, Streptanthus tortuosus, by manipulating seasonal germination timing in a common garden experiment. We also manipulated chilling exposure to test the role of vernalization cues for seasonal life history contingency. Plants germinating early in the growing season in autumn were more likely to flower in the first year and less likely to perennate than later germinants in spring. First-year reproduction and overall fitness was the highest for autumn cohorts. Sensitivity analyses showed that optimal germination date depended on survival beyond the first year and fruit production in later years. Experimental chilling exposure induced first-year flowering in spring germinants, demonstrating that seasonal life history contingency is mediated by a vernalization requirement. This requirement reduced fitness of spring germinants without increasing survival or later fecundity and may be maladaptive. Such mismatches between cues and fitness may become more pervasive as predicted climate change reduces exposure to chilling, shortens growing seasons, and increases severity of summer drought. Synthesis. Shifts in germination timing in seasonal environments can cause cascading effects on trait expression and fitness that extend beyond the first year of the life cycle. Climate change is likely to shift seasonal conditions, influencing such life history contingency, with significant impacts on trait expression, fitness, and population persistence. These shifts may cause strong natural selection on cue sensitivity and life history expression, but it is an open question whether populations have the potential for rapid adaptation in response to this selection. © 2019 The Authors.

However, the outcomes of direct seeding can be quite variable, and it is unclear whether direct seeding or planting is more likely to facilitate the restoration of diverse plant communities. To address this question, we compared the outcomes of each method across several recent riparian revegetation projects where both direct seeding and tube-stock planting were used. We surveyed riparian revegetation projects at seven sites within the greater Melbourne area that had been revegetated between 1 and 4 years previously. Sites were all on land previously used for agriculture or degraded public land and ranged in environmental and climatic conditions. Woody plant density, establishment of target species, species richness, species diversity (evenness) and plant heights were assessed. Direct seeding tended to result in higher plant densities and similar species richness, but lower rates of species establishment and diversity compared with planting. A median of 67% of target species established via direct seeding compared with 100% for planting, with direct seeded areas often dominated by one or two species. In general, overall revegetation outcomes were often driven by climatic and site factors, rather than revegetation method. We suggest that to achieve good restoration outcomes from revegetation in riparian areas, a bet-hedging or combined approach using both sowing and planting may be the best strategy. © 2019 Ecological Society of Australia and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","biodiversity; direct seeding; ecological restoration; riparian revegetation; tube-stock planting; vegetation diversity","bet-hedging; biodiversity; environmental restoration; plant community; revegetation; seeding; sowing; species diversity; species richness; Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]; Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077080029

Yet in practice, the concept may be less useful. This article examines how a programme in the Amazonian state of Acre, Brazil, has moved away from the concept of opportunity costs, challenging its theoretical importance. Instead of payments, the Acre programme offers ‘incentives’ intended to make rural people produce more whilst deforesting less. It resonates with the neoliberal commodification of carbon and the dominant valorization of intensive agriculture. Yet it also enlists lessons from Acre's history of rubber production and its rubber tapper-led social movement, namely that the living forest can be monetarily valuable and that its use can facilitate its protection.

About 90,000 ha of native mixed-grass and tallgrass prairie are managed by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) in North Dakota, South Dakota, and northeastern Montana. We used belt transects to classify floristic composition of all Service-owned prairies in the Dakotas and northeastern Montana. Prairies were significantly degraded, mainly by invasion of introduced grass and forb species and by native shrubs. In general, floristic integrity of Service-managed prairies was most compromised by smooth brome (Bromus inermis) and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis). The degradation was, in part, an unintended outcome of long-term management by the Service. The degree of degradation varied spatially across the broad geographic area defined by our study and was invader-specific, corresponding to geographic patterns in precipitation and temperature. Within the study area, floristic quality was relatively high on prairies toward the north and west, where plant growth sites generally were cooler and drier, based on long-term averages. In contrast, growth sites to the south and east generally were warmer, moister, and characterized by lower floristic quality, primarily because they were substantially invaded by smooth brome. Kentucky bluegrass was the most widespread invader of Service-owned prairies, with less frequent occurrence only in prairies dominated by smooth brome, especially in South Dakota or by native grass-forbs, especially in northwestern North Dakota and northeastern Montana.

Many studies have focused on the long-term impacts of exposure to PM, but short-term increases in pollution can also exacerbate health effects, leading to deaths brought forward within exposed populations. This study investigates the impact of different atmospheric circulation patterns on UK PM2.5 concentrations and the relative contribution of local and transboundary pollutants to variations in PM2.5 concentrations. Daily mean PM2.5 observations from 42 UK background sites indicate that easterly, south-easterly and southerly wind directions and anticyclonic circulation patterns enhance background concentrations of PM2.5 at all UK sites by up to 12 μg m-3. Results from back trajectory analysis and the European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme for UK model (EMEP4UK) show this is due to the transboundary transport of pollutants from continental Europe. While back trajectories indicate under easterly, south-easterly and southerly flow 25–50% of the total accumulated primary PM2.5 emissions originate outside of the UK, with a very polluted footprint (0.25–0.35 μg m-2). Anticyclonic conditions, which occur frequently (21%), also lead to increases in PM2.5 concentrations (UK multi-annual mean 14.7 μg m-3). EMEP4UK results indicate this is likely due the build-up of local emissions due to slack winds. Under westerly and north-westerly flow 15–30% of the total accumulated primary PM2.5 emissions originate outside of the UK, and are much less polluted (0.1 μg m-2) with model results indicating transport of clean maritime air masses from the Atlantic. Results indicate that both wind-direction and stability under anticyclonic conditions are important in controlling ambient PM2.5 concentrations across the UK. There is also a strong dependence of high PM2.5 Daily Air Quality Index (DAQI) values on easterly, south-easterly and southerly wind-directions, with &gt;70% of occurrences of observed 48–71+ μg m-3 concentrations occurring under these wind directions. While north-westerly and cyclonic conditions reduce PM2.5 concentrations at all sites by up to 8 μg m-3. PM2.5 DAQI values are also lowest under these conditions, with &gt;80% of 0–11 μg m-3 concentrations and &gt;50% of 12–23 μg m-3 concentrations observed during westerly, north-westerly and northerly wind directions. Indicating that these conditions are likely to be associated with a reduction in the potential health effects from exposure to ambient levels of PM2.5. © 2020 The Authors","Air quality; AURN; Emissions; LWT; PM2.5, long-range transport","Air quality; Particulate emissions; Ambient particulate Matter; Anticyclonic circulation; Atmospheric circulation patterns; AURN; Back trajectory analysis; Background concentration; European Monitoring and Evaluation Programme; Long range transport; Particles (particulate matter); air mass; air quality; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); cyclone; emission; long range transport; particulate matter; pollution effect; pollution exposure; westerly; air quality; article; Europe; particulate matter; pollutant; weather; Atlantic Ocean; Europe; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078850129

Human life on Earth, and our place within the planet's biophysical systems, changed dramatically with the Holocene, a geological epoch that began about 12,000 years ago. An unprecedented combination of climate stability and warm temperatures made possible a greater dependence on wild grains in several parts of the world. Over the next several thousand years, this dependence led to agriculture and large-scale state societies. These societies show a common pattern of expansion and collapse. Industrial civilization began a few hundred years ago when fossil fuel propelled the human economy to a new level of size and complexity. This change brought many benefits, but it also gave us the existential crisis of global climate change. Climate models indicate that the Earth could warm by 3°C-4 °C by the year 2100 and eventually by as much as 8 °C or more. This would return the planet to the unstable climate conditions of the Pleistocene when agriculture was impossible. Policies could be enacted to make the transition away from industrial civilization less devastating and improve the prospects of our hunter-gatherer descendants. These include aggressive policies to reduce the long-run extremes of climate change, aggressive population reduction policies, rewilding, and protecting the world's remaining indigenous cultures. © 2019 The Author(s)","Agricultural transition; Climate change; Collapse; Holocene; Hunter-gatherers; Mega-greenhouse effect","agriculture; civilization; climate variation; environmental policy; greenhouse effect; Holocene; hunter-gatherer; paleoclimate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076346685

Not only will climate change alter plant phenology, but it will also drive negative effects of several biotic and abiotic stressors. The challenge is to improve adaptation of varieties to a changing environment, while maintaining organoleptic qualities of the fruit. This chapter focuses on the progress in genomics-assisted breeding in peach to break barriers in conventional breeding. Breeding climate-smart (CS) peach trees requires the identification of CS traits used in the adaptation to high levels of temperature, CO2, water deprivation and biotic stress. Relevant CS traits, such as those that control flowering time (chilling and heat requirements), biotic and abiotic stress tolerance (pests and diseases; water-nutrient efficiency), require prioritization. Here, we review classical mapping and breeding of peach varieties, the progress and limitations of the used of marker-assisted selection and breeding (MAS and MAB, respectively) in expression of traits, such as fruit quality and stress tolerance, and describe the rationale for the use of molecular breeding. Genetic diversity analysis of Prunus germplasm, genome-wide association mapping and molecular mapping of CS genes and QTLs, andMABand genomics-aided breeding for CS traits are also reviewed. MAS and MAB have previously been considered as the optimal solution to plant breeding in the genomics era of plant biology, but genomic selection currently presents a promising alternative. Genomic selection is a marker-based strategy that accounts for quantitative traits controlled by a large number of genes with small effects like many CS traits. The precise phenotypic assessment and appropriate biometric analysis used to identify genotype responses is also discussed. The small, but active international peach research community has delivered a high-quality sequenced and annotated genome, along with several genomic tools, that potentiate each other in a positive feedback. Bioinformatics and computational biology are at the current a forefront of plant breeding programs and deal with diverse functional genomics datasets of gene expression, metabolomics and physiological stress responses. Taken together, existing genomic knowledge and tools may be used to confront the challenges of the development of peach varieties adapted to changing climate scenarios. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Chilling requirements; Flowering; Genetic diversity; GWAS; Marker-assisted breeding; Molecular mapping; Prunus persica; QTLs; SNPs; Stress tolerance",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85118520779

To increase the usefulness of citizen participation and the involvement of underrepresented groups, online participatory tools (OPTs) have attracted attention, in particular, on topics related to climate change. Although many OPTs have been developed and are becoming more widely used, assessments of their usefulness in real-world planning remain scarce. This study aimed to disentangle prospects and pitfalls of this still novel way of practicing citizen dialogue. Specifically, we apply criteria derived from related literatures to assess a mainstreamed OPT in Norrköping, Sweden. The CityPlanner? tool was discussed with citizens and planners using focus group methodology and semi-structured individual interviews. Moreover, citizen contributions in four applications of the OPT were analyzed. The results reveal that the biggest challenges for citizen dialogues on planning in general and on climate change, in particular, appear not mainly rooted in the technical functions of the OPT. Rather, problems lie in (i) the lack of municipal strategy for citizen participation and in applying OPTs, (ii) a disparagement in citizens' abilities to contribute to forming robust and sustainable cities, and (iii) in diverging views about the role of citizen contributions. This is reflected in how the OPT is used. While the examined OPT shows potential, the results indicate that visualized contexts for planning might be too scant to be entirely meaningful, and it lacks mechanisms for feedback. Not using the full potential of the OPT makes citizens less engaged and risks to adversely affect learning and citizens' contributions to solving complex issues. © 2020 by the authors.","Citizen participation; Climate change; Online participatory tools; Planning; Visualization","climate change; environmental policy; participatory approach; software; sustainability; visualization; World Wide Web; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079642771

The sharing of resources across households constitutes one coping mechanism when environmental shocks differentially impact households. This paper investigates commodity sharing dynamics among households in eight communities in an environmentally heterogeneous highland-lowland area in central Kenya. We use survey data and meteorological data to test whether commodity sharing, measured at the household level by net inflow of commodities, varies across a regional precipitation gradient, and we reveal how sharing fluctuates with rainfall over the course of a year. We find both precipitation and income to be significant predictors of households' net value of shared commodities. Specifically, farmers who live in drier areas with less income are more likely to receive more commodities than they give. We also find that the length of time a household has been established in the area is significantly related to commodity sharing. Further, commodity sharing follows the pattern of harvest and food storage over the course of the year, with households giving the most commodities at times when food storage levels are higher, that is, post-harvest. The study sheds light on the relationship between commodity sharing as a coping mechanism and environmental heterogeneity in a region prone to seasonal food insecurity. © 2020 Giroux et al.",,"agricultural land; agricultural management; agricultural worker; agroecosystem; Article; commodity sharing; coping behavior; female; food insecurity; food storage; harvest period; household; household income; human; Kenya; male; meteorological phenomena; precipitation; predictor variable; agriculture; ecosystem; family size; river; rain; water; Agriculture; Ecosystem; Family Characteristics; Farmers; Kenya; Rain; Rivers; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078690968

It is nearly a century later when the regional government acquired the entire share capital of a company owning three hydroelectric power plants in the region, changing its name in “Compagnia Valdostana delle Acque”. By the end of the twentieth century the incumbent state-owned operator sold to the regional government 26 hydroelectric plants located in the Region.

Tropical peatlands are threatened by both land use and climate change, including the alteration of regional precipitation patterns, and the 3–4 °C predicted warming by 2100. Plant communities in tropical peatlands can regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes through labile carbon inputs, but the extent to which these inputs regulate the temperature response of CO2 and CH4 production in tropical peat remains unclear. We conducted an anoxic incubation experiment using three peat types of contrasting botanical origin to assess how carbon addition affects the temperature response (Q10) of CO2 and CH4 production. Peats from forested peatlands in Panama and Malaysia, and a converted oil palm and pineapple intercropping system in Malaysia, differed significantly in redox potential, total carbon and carbon: nitrogen ratio. The production of CO2 and CH4 varied significantly among peat types and increased with increasing temperature, with Q10s for both gases of 1.4. Carbon addition further increased gas fluxes, but did not influence the Q10 for CO2 or CH4 production or significantly affect the Q10 of either gas. These findings demonstrate that the production of CO2 and CH4 in tropical peat is sensitive to warming and varies among peat types, but that the effect of root inputs in altering Q10 appears to be limited. © 2019, The Author(s).","Carbon dioxide; Land use change; Methane; Root exudates; Temperature sensitivity; Tropical peat","carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; greenhouse gas; intercropping; land use; methane; peatland; soil emission; tropical region; Malaysia; Panama [Central America]; Ananas comosus; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077082168

We paired manipulative experiments to probe two mechanistic pathways through which plant invasion and warming may alter phenology and reproduction of native plant species. In the first, we tested how experimental warming (+1.7°C) modulated flowering phenology and how this affected flowering overlap between a native plant (Dracophyllum subulatum) and an invasive plant (Calluna vulgaris L.). In the second experiment, we explored how variation in the ratio of native to invasive flowers, and the overall quantity of resources in a floral patch, affected the reproduction of the native species. We hypothesized that the flowering overlap of native and invasive plants would be altered by warming, given that invading plants typically exhibit greater phenological plasticity than native plants. Further, we hypothesized that pollination of native plant flowers would decrease in floral patches dominated by invasive plant flowers, but that this effect would depend on total floral density in the patch. As predicted, the invasive plant had a stronger phenological response to experimental warming than the native plant, resulting in increased flowering overlap between the native the invasive plants. There was a four-fold increase in the number of native flowers co-flowering with high densities of invasive flowers suggesting native plant competition for pollinators with invasive plants under a warmed climate. In the second experiment, we found depressed seed masses of the native species in high density floral patches that were dominated by invasive flowers relative to high density floral patches dominated by native flowers. At low floral densities, seed mass of native plants was unaffected by invasion. Together, these results demonstrate that by increasing their phenological overlap, warming may enhance the magnitude of existing competition for pollination exerted by an invasive plant on a native plant, particularly in plant patches with high floral density. Our results illustrate a novel pathway through which global change drivers can operate synergistically to alter an important ecosystem service: pollination. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","alpine community; Calluna vulgaris; climate change; competition for pollination; experimental warming; invasion; landscape","biological invasion; environmental effect; global change; native species; phenology; phenotypic plasticity; pollination; population density; seed set; Calluna vulgaris; Dracophyllum subulatum; climate change; ecosystem; flower; plant; pollination; reproduction; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Flowers; Plants; Pollination; Reproduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075435521

However, shifts in climate characteristics may result in increases of the magnitude and frequency of potential risks, or expose specific CI to new or increased risks not previously considered. As vital components of the normal functioning of modern societies, their resilience encompasses the operational elements, their structural integrity and the capacity to maximise business output under climate stressors. In this work, we apply an integrated and participatory methodological approach to assess the risk and enhance the resilience of interconnected CIs to urban flooding under climate change.

To a large extent, although not limited to it, this is due to their energy consumption; in the EU this accounts for some 40% of the total final energy consumption. The EU therefore set a goal to reduce energy use by 20% by 2020, as part of the five headline targets of the European 20-20-20 Strategy. The goal was risen to 27% by 2030, as part of the new and more ambitious goals that were presented in 2018. Moreover, the European Commission has established since 2002 a common policy for sustainable buildings and low environmental impact materials, promoting energy efficiency and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), expressed by means of a series of directives and regulations. The legislative framework for GHG emissions is supported by a series of international standards such as the Greenhouse Gas Protocol Initiative and the ISO 14064-65 series of standards which are fully compatible with the GHG Protocol and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The Directive 2012/27/EU on Energy Efficiency is also important to mention, as it introduces obligatory Energy Audits in companies and organizations, as a major tool towards improving efficiency and promoting sustainability. Goal of the paper is to present and analyse the results of the integrated evaluation based on the energy and environmental audit of a very interesting public building, namely the Onassis Cultural Centre, in Athens, Greece. The building presented a real challenge with its daring architecture, the variety of uses it hosts and the state of the art equipment it features. Based on the audit's outcome, the analysis the carbon footprint indicator was performed. The methodology followed will be presented in the paper, along with the opportunities we detected for improvements in the energy and environmental management, which was admittedly already at a very high level. From a scientific point it was very interesting to understand the patterns of energy use and to define the processes which contribute to more energy efficient and sustainable buildings, ensuring the low ecological footprint that is definitely part of integrated design of buildings. Finally, effective energy conservation and low carbon measures for public buildings are introduced and related to operating and production costs for buildings, making them hence more competitive. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon footprint; Climate change; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Historic preservation; Intelligent buildings; Laws and legislation; Office buildings; Sustainable development; Ecological footprint; Greenhouse gas protocols; Improving efficiency; Integrated evaluation; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; International standards; Legislative frameworks; State-of-the-art equipments; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079636848

The different overpass times of the satellite spectrometers: SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY (SCIAMACHY) (1030 h LT) and Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) (1330 h LT)), enable detection of changes in NO2 columns at two different times of the day, providing some insight on its diurnal variation. Observations show elevated tropospheric NO2 columns in the afternoon compared to the morning in the vicinity of the HETPPs (~65% higher), contrary to the expected decrease due to enhanced photochemical loss of NO2 in the afternoon and increased concentrations in the morning due to peak-hour vehicular emissions. The observed diurnal variability was simulated using a regional atmospheric composition model and the deviations in nitrogen oxide (NO), NO2, ozone (O3) and hydroperoxy radical (HO2) between 1030 h and 1330 h within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) were examined. We also examined the vertical and horizontal accumulated tendencies of NO2 (advection) and wind profiles directly over the emission. The results show that the vertical variability of chemical loss processes, driven by a change in vertical mixing of NO2 within the PBL and variability in advection (driven by winds) leads to a net increase in the afternoon NO2 columns over the HETPPs, even if we assume flat emissions throughout the day. These results suggest that meteorology along with PBL evolution affects the diurnal evolution of NO2 columnar abundance over locations with high emissions in India. © 2019 The Authors","Air Quality; Tropspheric NO2; WRF-Chem","Advection; Air quality; Atmospheric boundary layer; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Boundary layer flow; Ozone; Thermoelectric power plants; Troposphere; Ultraviolet spectrometers; Chemistry transport model; Ozone monitoring instruments; Planetary boundary layers; Satellite spectrometers; Scanning imaging absorption spectrometer for atmospheric chartography; Tropospheric nitrogen dioxide; Tropspheric NO2; WRF-Chem; Nitrogen oxides; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; ozone; radical; air quality; boundary layer; diurnal variation; emission; nitrogen dioxide; power plant; thermal power; troposphere; vertical mixing; advection; astronomy; atmospheric transport; boundary layer; chemical composition; chemical reaction; circadian rhythm; climate; comparative study; concentration (parameter); controlled study; electric power plant; greenhouse gas; India; meteorology; photochemistry; priority journal; thermal pollution; troposphere; ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; wind; wind speed; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078822411

Non-edible biomass (also called second-generation biomass) is often divided in three categories, which are straws, softwood and hardwood. Each of these categories involves the same major macromolecules: cellulose, hemicelluloses and lignin. To a lesser extent, this biomass may also contain proteins and lipids (mostly for agricultural biomass belonging to the straw category). Finally, all contain extractives (or secondary metabolites) which amongst all constituents are the most unpredictable. Finally, the inorganic content of lignocellulosic biomass has also a major impact on its application, especially in the field of bioenergy. In this chapter, the focus will be given on providing different levels of quantification for each of these macromolecules. When, in some cases, only a general composition is sufficient, simple analysis based on gravimetric methods will be provided. However, some applications of biomass will require a deeper investigation of the different macromolecules and in that sense, more comprehensive protocols, involving state of the art analytics such as spectroscopy and chromatography will be provided. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089042229

The sensing was most favourable on hollow sites but with different coordination numbers and geometrical configurations. A substantial variation in the gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the 2D material (e.g. from 4.12 to 0.36 eV in the case of buckled heptazine structure) delineated the high capability of the sensor toward the detection of the chromium ion. Remarkable charge transfers (4.466–4.558 e) from the sensor to the analyte were evident from the topological analysis. Neglecting the surface corrugation could overestimate the adsorption energy while underestimating the HOMO–LUMO gap of both types of graphitic carbon nitride.

The buildings are the third highest GHG emitter in Toronto (25% of overall GHG emissions), it is crucial to investigate the current level of GHG emissions resulting from the buildings and try to deploy GHG emission reduction strategies in order to achieve the target reductions of 2020 and 2050. Energy benchmarking and developing meaningful performance indicators can help government and building owners/managers to make effective decisions on improving their buildings' efficiency and carbon footprint. For this study, information on 120 multi-unit residential buildings (MURBs) has been benchmarked and analyzed. The study entails the following steps: performing energy benchmarking using statistical analysis, developing meaningful performance indicators, determining performance ranking, and examine different levels of percentile savings (energy and GHG emissions). The study concluded that the most appropriate indicators are energy consumption per square meter (kWh/m2), energy consumption per number of occupants (kWh/capita), energy consumption per number of units (kWh/units), and energy consumption per number of floors (kWh/floor). The range of energy performance indicator for the chosen MURBs varies 141–580 kWh/year-m2. Although reducing the overall natural gas consumption (improving heating system and domestic hot water system) may not lead into much of cost savings (due to the system upgrade), but it can have significant positive environmental impacts (reducing GHG emissions). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy benchmarking; Multi-unit residential buildings; Performance indicators; Performance ratings; PRISM method","Benchmarking; Carbon footprint; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hot water distribution systems; Housing; Natural gas; Energy benchmarking; Energy performance indicators; GHG emission reduction strategies; Natural gas consumption; Performance indicators; Performance rankings; Performance ratings; Residential building; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073024152

This includes the time dependent change in short-range order at temperatures close to the melting point and comparison with the hexagonal ice structure. Using the molecular dynamics method, dependencies of the internal energy of the studied systems on the time of heating were found. Jumps in the internal energy of solids in the range at 275–300 K indicate a phase transition. The study of the oxygen‑oxygen radial distribution and hydrogen‑oxygen‑oxygen mutual orientation angles between molecules detached at no >3.2 Å led to the determination of the H-bond coordination number for all molecules and the total number of H-bonds and showed instantaneous (<1 ns) reorganization of the short-range order of all molecules. Structural analysis of neighbor water molecule pairs showed ~10–15% decrease in the H-bond number after melting whereas all molecules form a single long-range H-bond network.

The differences in the composition, bulk atmospheric deposition, and resources of PAHs in soils in key areas controlled by the production technology and the duration of the plant work were revealed. It was established that all key areas are characterized by lower modern delivery of PAHs in comparison with the activities of plants in the past. The highest amounts and the heaviest composition of PAHs were detected near a nonoperating plant, which previously had used an environmentally unfavorable tube technology. In all areas, the soils are characterized by a higher proportion of phenanthrene associations in relation to the snow; without account for phenanthrene in soils, the same PAHs dominate in the snow.

Most frequently, CFD is applied for the relatively rapid analysis of steady flows (CFD)s. More recently, an event-based stepwise steady flow CFD model (CFD)ss was developed to predict particulate matter (PM) separation with reduced computational overhead compared with unsteady CFD modeling (CFD)us. This study developed an event-based (CFD)ss model to evaluate longer-term UO performance. The (CFD)ss models simulated PM fate (separation and washout) in a rectangular clarifier (RC) and a screened hydrodynamic separator (SHS) for a representative year of runoff (2007) in North Florida. Washout and separation for all unsteady events were integrated into a time domain continuous simulation model. The (CFD)ss model was validated with measured PM separation and washout data from full-scale physical models. The annual PM separation for the RC was 40% with no washout and 38% with washout. Annual PM separation for the SHS was 37% with no washout and 27% with washout. The annual SHS washout profile indicated maintenance cleanout at the start and end of the wet season. Coupling (CFD)ss with continuous simulation represents a tool extending UO evaluations from an unsteady event-basis to an annual basis. Simulating all runoff events in 2007 required 14 h of computational time for the RC and SHS. Implications from these results indicate that longer-term prediction of UO separation/washout is viable with (CFD)ss coupled with a continuous simulation model such as the Storm Water Management Model (SWMM), and can serve as a tool for UO testing/certification. © 2019 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Computational fluid dynamics; Continuous simulation; Runoff; Scour; Storm Water Management Model (SWMM)","Hydrodynamics; Particles (particulate matter); Runoff; Scour; Steady flow; Storms; Water distribution systems; Water management; Computational overheads; Computational time; Continuous simulation; Hydrodynamic separators; Particulate Matter; Rainfall-runoff events; Rectangular clarifiers; Stormwater management model(SWMM); Computational fluid dynamics; computational fluid dynamics; hydrodynamics; particulate matter; rainfall-runoff modeling; runoff; scour; separation; steady flow; water management; Florida [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075103146

Kothapally watershed, which was in degraded stage before 1999, is transformed into highly productive stage through science-led natural resource management interventions. A number of AWM interventions such as field bunding, low-cost gully control structures and masonry check dams, etc., were built as per hydrological assessment and need of the community. Ridge to valley approach of rainwater harvesting addressed equity issue as farmers from upstream end benefited along with downstream users. A number of AWM interventions reduced surface runoff (30–60%) and soil loss (two- to fivefolds) and enhanced groundwater recharge (50–150%) and base flow. Water table increased from 2.5 to 6.0 m on an average after the AWM interventions. This change has translated into surplus irrigation water availability and crop intensification especially during post monsoonal season. Further, all such changes translated into better crop yield, higher cropping intensity, and higher crop production and net income over the years that resulted into building the resilience of the individuals and community to cope with droughts and impacts of climate change. This case study clearly indicates that large untapped potential exists in dryland areas which could be harnessed through science-led NRM interventions. Scaling up approach of these interventions through pilots at various locations in India, Thailand, Vietnam, and China demonstrated the potential for overcoming food and water scarcity sustainably and at the same time contributing to meet the sustainable development goals of zero hunger, water availability, and climate actions. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

Here we examine (a) whether techno-optimism is found among Midwestern corn and soybean farmers and (b) how this confidence in human ingenuity influences their support for climate change adaptation. By examining data from a survey of nearly 5,000 grain farmers in the Midwestern United States, we found that greater techno-optimism can reduce farmers’ support for climate change adaptation and increase their propensity to express a preference to delay adaptation-related actions. This study advances our understanding of how social and cognitive factors influence farmers’ attitude toward climate change. Findings from this study can also help extension educators to develop outreach programs that are sensitive to farmers’ views about the ability of science and technology to solve climate change–related issues. © The Author(s) 2018.","adaptation; climate change; farmer; techno-optimism; uncertainty","adaptive management; agricultural technology; climate change; farmers attitude; human behavior; nature-society relations; perception; science and technology; uncertainty analysis; Midwest; United States; Glycine max; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052595062

The average concentration of VOCs was 2.3 times higher during the polluted period (105.29 µg m–3) than the clean period (45.78 µg m–3), whereas the average concentrations of the alkanes, alkenes, and aromatics were 3.4, 2.1, and 3.9 times higher, respectively, during the polluted period than the clean period. In addition, the VOC concentration was significantly influenced by meteorological conditions. Using positive matrix factorization (PMF), seven sources of atmospheric VOCs were identified, with the largest factors being vehicle emission (27.89%), coal combustion (23.37%), liquefied petroleum gas/natural gas evaporation (18.30%), and industrial emission (15.51%). Vehicle emission (30.04%) was the primary contributor during the polluted period, whereas coal combustion (33.53%) was the primary contributor during the clean period. The SOA formation potential (which almost exceeded 80%) was influenced by industrial emission (28.80%), solvent usage (26.30%), and vehicle emission (24.85%). Additionally, an assessment of the health risks of six aromatics based on the health risk exposure model of the United States Environmental Protection Agency revealed that the non-cancer risk was higher during the polluted period (6.61 × 10–2) than the clean period (2.20 × 10–2) but still below the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) limit (1.00) and therefore negligible for the exposed population. However, the carcinogenic index of benzene (2.85 × 10–5 to 5 × 10–5) exceeded 10–6, suggesting a higher carcinogenic risk. Large-scale energy restructuring during recent years has sharply reduced coal combustion, but the VOC concentration has dramatically increased due to vehicle emission. Hence, regulating vehicle emissions is an effective strategy for controlling VOCs in Yuncheng. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.","Health risk assessment; Pollution period; Secondary organic aerosol formation potential; Source apportionment; Volatile organic compounds","Aerosols; Coal; Environmental Protection Agency; Factorization; Gas chromatography; Health; Health risks; Hydrocarbons; Industrial emissions; Petroleum industry; Pollution; Risk assessment; Risk management; Vehicles; Volatile organic compounds; Average concentration; Composition characteristics; Formation potential; Meteorological condition; Positive Matrix Factorization; Secondary organic aerosols; Source apportionment; United States environmental protection agency; Coal combustion; aerosol composition; benzene; carcinogen; coal combustion; evaporation; health risk; industrial emission; petroleum hydrocarbon; risk assessment; source apportionment; traffic emission; volatile organic compound; China; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078254580

It was found that the oxygen partial pressure atmicro-region of TiO2-NTAs surfacewas critical for the creation of black TiO2 NTAs. The oxygen vacancies in the prepared B-TiO2 NTAs induced new defect energy levels in the band gap of TiO2, which reduced the band gap and broadened their visible light absorption. Furthermore, the oxygen vacancies could also act as the catalytic sites and accelerate surface reactions for the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO, which also was proved by isotope experiment. Especially, B-TiO2 NTAs annealed at 600â., showed an excellent photocatalytic CO2 reduction to CO performance with the yield of 185.39 μmol g-1 h-1 under visible light illumination because the oxygen vacancy self-doping largely enhanced three key factors in this process, including photoinduced charge generation, charge separation and transportation and interfacial reaction.

Herein, a 4-electrode CBPEC configuration was studied with the opposite poles of the bipolar electrode resting in separate aqueous and organic electrolyte solutions. Using gold mesh wire electrodes as the poles, we systematically investigated the many experimental variables that influence the observed voltammetry upon addition of a reductant (decamethylferrocene) to the organic phase. External bias of the driving electrodes forced electrons released by decamethylferrocene at the organic pole to flow along the bipolar electrode and reduce redox active surface functional groups at the aqueous pole, such as oxide or hydroxide groups, or carry out the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) or hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The 4-electrode CBPEC configuration diminishes capacitive currents, permitting observation of voltammetric signals from electron transfer processes related to surface functional groups at the aqueous pole at much lower scan rates than possible with working electrodes in conventional 3-electrode electrochemical cells. Surface modification, by oxidative or reductive electrochemical pre-treatment, changes the potential window experienced by the aqueous pole in the 4-electrode CBPEC in terms of its position versus the standard hydrogen electrode (SHE) and dynamic range. In a related observation, the electrochemical responses from the surface functional groups on the aqueous pole completely disappear after oxidative pre-treatment, but remain after reductive pre-treatment. The flow of electrons from decamethylferrocene to the surface of the aqueous pole is limited in magnitude, by the decamethylferrocene concentration, and kinetically limited, due to decamethylferrocene diffusion to the organic pole, in comparison to the infinite supply of electrons delivered to the surface of a working electrode in a 3-electrode cell. This unique feature of the 4-electrode CBPEC facilitates a very gradual evolution of the surface chemistry at the aqueous pole, for example from fully oxidised after oxidative pre-treatment to a more reduced state after repetitive cyclic voltammetry cycling. Perspective applications of this slow, controlled release of electrons to the electrode surface include spectroelectrochemical analysis of intermediate states for the reduction of metal salts to nanoparticles, or conversion of CO2 to reduced products at catalytic sites. The use of indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes in CBPEC experiments for specific reactions is recommended to avoid misleading or interfering electrochemical responses from redox active functional groups prevalent on metallic surfaces. However, the electronic bridge to implement entirely depends on the reaction under study, as ITO also has drawbacks such as a lack of electrocatalytic activity and the requirement of an overpotential due to its semiconducting nature. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bipolar electrochemistry; Bipolar electrode; Hydrogen evolution reaction; Oxygen reduction reaction; Redox active surface functional groups","Cyclic voltammetry; Electrochemical cells; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Electrons; Gold; Hydrogen; Mesh generation; Metal nanoparticles; Poles; Redox reactions; Spectroelectrochemistry; Surface reactions; Tin oxides; Bipolar electrochemistries; Bipolar electrodes; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Oxygen reduction reaction; Redox-active; Electrochemical electrodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075836135

Despite the importance of these autumn interactions, their potential to shift with climate change and species invasions remains poorly understood. As invasive fleshy-fruited shrubs spread across the Northeast USA and many landbird species pass through stopover sites later with warming temperatures, the potential for changes in bird-fruit interactions depends on the phenology and availability of native and invasive wild fruits, and bird preferences across the autumn season. We observed the fruiting phenology of 25 native and invasive fleshy-fruited wild plant species at Manomet, a migratory stopover site on the coast of Massachusetts, USA, during the autumn migration season (August to November) in 2014 and 2015. We also monitored fruit availability across Manomet in 2015. To determine whether fruit consumption reflected phenology and availability, we identified seeds from 469 fecal samples collected from songbirds captured during the 2014 and 2015 autumn banding seasons. We found that while invasive shrubs fruited later, on average, than native plants, and comprised a large proportion of the total available fruits in late-autumn, birds primarily consumed the fruits of native species throughout the autumn season. Our results demonstrate that native fruits are an important food resource for birds during the autumn migration season and are unlikely to be replaced by abundant fruits of late-season invasive species under climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Feeding preference; Fleshy fruit; Fruit phenology; Invasive plant; Migratory bird; Woody plant","bird; climate change; feeding behavior; fruit; fruiting; invasive species; migratory population; phenology; seasonality; wild population; woody plant; Manomet; Massachusetts; United States; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075375670

High resolution plant macrofossil analysis and radiocarbon dating were undertaken on two cores, with lower resolution geochemical analysis conducted on one of these cores. We provide evidence of a palaeolake with a late Glacial origin (older than 12,500 years). Abundant fossil presence of macrophytes (e.g. multiple Potamogeton species) in the studied palaeomeander may indicate that the north–south orientation of the Prosna valley made it an important route for the spreading of aquatic plants during the late Glacial. Chara sp., Batrachium sp. and Potamogeton spp. were the pioneer plants that colonised cold water with a high Ca2+ content. Early Holocene warming trigged a decrease in water level at the oxbow lake and facilitated the expansion of thermophilous water plants, for example, Ceratophyllum demersum, Typha sp. and Lemna trisulca, which usually occur in shallow water. A decreasing water level resulted in the gradual isolation of the study site from the influence of groundwater, leading to acidification of the habitat and the development of a Sphagnum population, with S. contortum and S. teres as dominant species. The presence of S. contortum (the oldest occurrence in the European lowlands) and S. teres during the early Holocene may indicate that river valleys and the peatlands that developed in this region acted as an important habitats (and possibly refugia) for some minerotrophic Sphagnum species. © The Author(s) 2019.","climate change; peatland; plant macrofossils; plant succession; Prosna River; refugia; Sphagnum succession","acidification; aquatic plant; climate change; climate variation; cold water; geochemical cycle; Holocene; macrophyte; oxbow lake; peatland; radiocarbon dating; succession; water level; wetland; Poland [Central Europe]; Prosna River; Ceratophyllum demersum; Chara; Lemna trisulca; Potamogeton; Sphagnum; Sphagnum contortum; Sphagnum teres; Typha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074761209

Reducing FLW increases agricultural and value-chain productivity and may reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with feeding the global population. Although studies of interventions that reduce FLW exist, almost no research systematically investigates FLW interventions across multiple value chains or countries, most likely due to challenges in collecting and synthesizing data and estimates, let alone estimating greenhouse gas emissions. Our research team investigated changes in FLW in projects supported by the United States Agency for International Development's (USAID) global hunger and food security initiative, Feed the Future. This was a unique opportunity to conduct ex-ante estimates of the impacts of FLW interventions across 20 value chains in 12 countries, based on project documents and interviews with USAID and project staff. This paper describes specific interventions in each value chain and country context, providing insight to interventions that decrease FLW at multiple points along food value chains, from upstream producer-dominated stages to downstream consumer-dominated stages. Amongst the sub-sectors studied, FLW interventions directed at extensive dairy systems could decrease FLW by 4–10%, providing meaningful greenhouse gas mitigation, since these systems are both emission-intensive and experience high FLW. More modest emissions reductions were found for other key agricultural products, including maize, rice, vegetables, fruits and market goods. © 2019 The Authors","Agricultural management; Climate change mitigation; Food loss and waste; Greenhouse gas emissions; Postharvest loss","Agricultural products; Climate change; Food supply; Greenhouse gases; Waste management; Agricultural development; Agricultural management; Climate change mitigation; Environmental burdens; Food loss; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Post-harvest loss; United states agency for international development; Gas emissions; agricultural development; climate change; emission control; food consumption; food waste; greenhouse gas; harvesting; agricultural management; article; carbon footprint; climate change; consumer; food security; fruit; government; human; hunger; interview; maize; nonhuman; postharvest period; rice; vegetable; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074364434

In particular, metalloporphyrins are utilized as pivotal components to mimic the structure and function of the photosynthetic reaction center. Metalloporphyrins are used as photoredox catalysts for hydrogen evolution from electron and proton sources combining hydrogen evolution catalysts. Metalloporphyrins also act as thermal redox catalysts for photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with photoredox catalysts. Metalloporphyrins are also used as dual catalysts for a photoredox catalyst for oxygenation of substrates with H2O and a redox catalyst for O2 reduction when dioxygen is used as a two-electron oxidant and H2O as an oxygen source, both of which are the greenest reactants.

This study examined long-term (2004–2017) monitoring of PNCs and other pollutants at a traffic intersection and other sites in Japan. The decay rate of elemental carbon concentrations at the traffic intersection excellently matched the reductions of PM mass in tailpipe emissions from diesel trucks, indicating that the reduction in atmospheric concentrations directly reflected cleaner vehicle exhausts. Both the reduction of traffic volume and the replacement of older vehicles with newer models that comply with tighter regulations were found to reduce emissions. However, a slower reduction trend was found for exhaust-related PNCs (after excluding photochemically formed aerosols) with particle diameter Dp &lt; 100 nm. The mixed fleet emission factor (EF) on a PN basis (EFPN) (Dp = 10–100 nm) of medium- and heavy-duty diesel trucks during 2005–2016 was estimated to range over 1.1–4.9 × 1014 km−1 veh−1 and 0.5–7.4 × 1014 km−1 veh−1 in winter and summer, respectively, under urban driving conditions (0–50 km h−1). For the EFPN of diesel trucks by regulation year, which was estimated using a combination of traffic data and the positive matrix factorization model applied to environmental data, the EFPN of diesel trucks that meet the 1988–1990 regulation was the highest at 1016 km−1 veh−1 and that of those that meet the latest emission regulation (2009–2010), which requires a diesel oxidation catalyst, a diesel particulate filter (DPF), and a NOx catalyst, was the lowest at 1.4 × 1013 km−1 veh−1. The EFPN of the latest regulation diesel trucks was one order of magnitude lower than that of the mixed fleet EFPN of diesel trucks in 2016. Therefore, when all diesel trucks have been replaced by diesel trucks that meet the latest emission regulation, it is expected that the atmospheric PNC will be reduced by one order of magnitude. However, the EFPN of the latest regulation diesel trucks obtained from environmental data was two orders of magnitude higher than the limit value of the Particulate Measurement Programme regulation for non-volatile particles when comparing at the same emission level of PM mass. Further, since all diesel trucks that meet the latest emission regulation are equipped with a DPF, most of the non-volatile particles should be removed from the exhaust by the DPF. Therefore, the condensable particles and their precursors such as semi-volatile compounds are expected to be the cause of this gap; thus, these control policies are needed to further reduce the vehicle-exhaust-derived PN in the environment. © 2019 The Authors","Diesel truck; Emission factor; Nanoparticle; Particle number concentration; Traffic intersection; Ultrafine particle","Automobiles; Catalysts; Diesel engines; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Factorization; Fleet operations; Nanoparticles; Particulate emissions; Trucks; Volatile organic compounds; Diesel truck; Emission factors; Particle number concentration; Traffic intersections; Ultrafine particle; Particles (particulate matter); carbon; diesel fuel; volatile agent; aerosol; concentration (composition); condition factor; elemental carbon; environmental factor; exhaust emission; nanoparticle; particulate matter; replacement; traffic emission; transport vehicle; air quality control; Article; concentration (parameter); exhaust gas; Japan; oxidation; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; summer; urban area; winter; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076284688

Although hydrogen production from renewable resources is still limited to small scale, local solutions, and R&amp;D projects; steam reforming (SR) of natural gas at industrial scale is the cheapest and most used technology and generates around 8 kg CO2 per kg H2. This paper is focused on the process optimization and decarbonization of H2 production from fossil fuels to promote more efficient approaches based on membrane separation. In this work, two emerging configurations have been compared from the numerical point of view: the membrane reactor (MR) and the reformer and membrane module (RMM), proposed and tested by this research group. The rate of hydrogen production by SR has been calculated according to other literature works, a one-dimensional model has been developed for mass, heat, and momentum balances. For the membrane modules, the rate of hydrogen permeation has been estimated according to mass transfer correlation previously reported by this research group and based on previous experimental tests carried on in the first RMM Pilot Plant. The methane conversion, carbon dioxide yield, temperature, and pressure profile are compared for each configuration: SR, MR, and RMM.

Therefore, this research focuses for the first time on the detailed identification and classification of fossil asteroids and ophiuroids from the Jaguariaíva and São Domingos members of the Ponta Grossa Formation. As a result, four species are described herein, Paranaster crucis nov. gen., nov. sp., Magnasterella darwini (Clarke, 1913) nov. gen., Encrinaster pontis (Clarke, 1913), and Marginix notatus nov. sp. In addition, the Paranasteridae nov. fam. is also proposed. On the other hand, the taphonomic analysis of this asterozoans, together with the interpretation of sedimentary matrix and associated fossil assemblages, reveals important palaeoenvironment details from the Devonian of the Paraná Basin. These echinoderms lived in a marine platform governed by a polar climate and low sedimentation rates. But the commonly articulated asterozoans also support important events of rapid burial. Finally, this research expands the diversity of malvinokaffric echinoderms, contributing to the palaeoecological reconstruction of the Ponta Grossa Formation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Asteroidea; Ophiuroidea; Palaeoecology; Ponta Grossa Formation; Taphonomy; Taxonomy","Devonian; echinoderm; paleoecology; taphonomy; taxonomy; Parana Basin; Asterozoa; Echinodermata; Invertebrata; Ophiuroidea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074126940

The present study evaluates the effect of Rhizophagus intraradices inoculation on tomato plant physiology and yield in response to progressive water deficit conditions. Two commercial products (Prod1 and Prod2) containing only R. intraradices were tested at two different concentrations (1% and 5% of the substrate volume) using three methods of inoculation: (a) mixed to substrate, (b) dissolved in water, (c) spread on seedlings root blocks before transplant. The highest mycorrhization of root fragments (F%) was found with Prod2 at 1% w/w at 40 days after sowing (DAS); this product was therefore used in a second experiment to inoculate tomato plants and test their physiological response to progressive water deficit induced withholding irrigation. Phenology, plant height, stem diameter, chlorophyll content and fluorescence, whole canopy gas exchange, biomass production and partitioning and phosphorus content were investigated in inoculated and not inoculated tomato plants under well‐watered and water stressed conditions. Vegetative period and plant height were shorter in inoculated than in control plants; moreover, inoculation with R. intraradices increased fruit production by enhancing chlorophyll content under water stress condition, PS2 efficiency, ETR, Fv/Fm, net photosynthetic rate and whole canopy WUE. © 2020 by the authors.","Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; ETR; Net photosynthetic rate; Progressive water deficit; Threshold of fraction of transportable soil water; Tomato; Water use efficiency; Whole canopy gas exchange",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077675128

Design/methodology/approach: The paper draws on data collected from a qualitative research design that used participatory rural appraisal methods, particularly, in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and seasonal calendar analysis in three selected rural communities of the Sissala East District. Furthermore, an inter-generational framework was adopted for comparative assessment of vulnerability and changes in vulnerability to climate change. Findings: The results show that the current generation of smallholder farmers is more vulnerable to climate change than the past generation, the era of grandparents. Thus, farmers are exposed to higher-intensity sunshine, temperature and wind in contemporary times than was the case in the past. Consequently, their livelihoods are affected the most by the damaging effects of these climatic hazards. The CRA process revealed the relevance of indigenous knowledge systems for vulnerability assessments and at the same time, underpins the need for adaptation of such knowledge if it is to sustain smallholder farmer efforts at climate change adaptation at community levels. Practical implications: The paper recommends an endogenous development approach to climate change adaptation planning (CCAP), one that will build on indigenous knowledge systems for effective community education, mobilization and participatory response to climate change. Policy interventions should aim at enhancing climate change adaptation through innovations in soil and water conservation, access to water for irrigation and domestic use, climate smart-housing architecture and agro-forestry within the framework of decentralization and district development planning. Originality/value: This paper will contribute to climate change research in two ways: first, by drawing attention to the usefulness of CRA in vulnerability assessment; and second, by focusing on climate elements which are critical for CCAP but rarely given sufficient attention in vulnerability assessments. © 2019, Dramani J.M.

The off-cycle values represent a substantial amount of the overall regulated reduction in emissions for the regulatory programs and the exact extent of this benefice depends on how large the regulatory reduction is considered. In many countries, the energy efficiency legislation considers the off-cycle credits, since it has been demonstrated, and encourages the automakers to use new and innovative technologies, resulting in improvements in vehicle energy efficiency. On the other hand, off-cycle benefits are difficult to measure due to the changes in the environmental conditions, traffic, temperature and others. The vehicles operating in real life have more diverse conditions than on the standards test cycle. The Start & Stop technology fuel consumption reduction is a good example of this. The ""Rota 2030"" is the new Brazilian legislation approved at the end of 2018, considered this benefit to some technologies.

Using a portable device, we evaluated dust emissions from surfaces either inoculated with biocrust, amended with a plant-based soil stabilizer, or both at varying wind friction velocities. Four months after application, emissions from all treatments were either indistinguishable from or greater than controls, despite evidence of biocrust establishment. All treatments had greater surface roughness and showed more evidence of entrapment of windblown sediment than controls, factors which may have been partially responsible for elevated emissions. There was a synergistic effect of inoculation and stabilizer addition, resulting in a nearly two-fold reduction in estimated emissions compared to either treatment alone. Stepwise regression analysis indicated that variables associated with surface crust strength (aggregate stability, penetration resistance) were negatively associated with emissions and variables associated with sediment supply (sand content, loose sediment cover) were positively associated with emissions. With more time to develop, the soil-trapping activity and surface integrity of biocrust inoculum and soil stabilizer mixtures is expected to increase with the accumulation of surface biomass and enhancement of roughness through freeze–thaw cycles. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","aeolian; Colorado Plateau; cyanobacteria; dust; erosion; lichen; moss; PI-SWERL; restoration","Dust; Erosion; Image reconstruction; Regression analysis; Sediments; Soil conditioners; Soils; Surface roughness; aeolian; Colorado Plateau; cyanobacteria; lichen; moss; Soil pollution; cyanobacterium; dust; eolian process; erodibility; erosion rate; plateau; soil crust; surface roughness; Colorado Plateau; United States; Bryophyta; Cyanobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075177874

Given this gap, the present study aims to quantify the environmental impacts of wild red deer culling (Cervus elaphus) through selective hunting in a mountainous Italian district, adopting a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA) approach. Nine impact categories are evaluated using the International Reference Life Cycle Data System (ILCD) v1.09 impact assessment method, with climate change filling a special role. The results highlight that the long distances covered by the hunters to cull wild red deer is the hotspot of the supply chain representing almost 85% of the impact in every considered impact categories. Focusing on climate change, the outcomes show that the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) per functional unit (4.85 kg CO2eq) are largely influenced by the hypothesis considering the wild red deer as an elementary flow entering the system and, thus, not including enteric methane emissions. In this case, the hunted red deer meat appears to be an environmentally sustainable alternative to conventional beef. The representativeness of the findings has to be increased both within the same species and in association with other wild ungulates (e.g., roe deer, wild boar or chamois) to better understand the potential role of traditionally hunted wild products in more sustainable diets. © 2019","Biotic resource; LCA; Protein supply chain; Red deer; Venison; Wild ruminants","Environmental impact; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Mammals; Meats; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Biotic resource; Enteric methane emissions; Functional units; Impact assessments; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Red deer; Venison; Wild ruminants; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073224511

The purposes of the current study were to seek effective ways to reduce the negative impacts of smallholder systems on the environment by using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method and data from field investigations and high-yield demonstration fields with WMSs in four representative counties across the HFR. High-yield demonstration fields with optimized fertilizer management had a higher carbon balance (CB), lower carbon intensity and higher fertilizer use efficiency than smallholder fields. The CB and carbon emissions differed among counties due to differences in input and output levels. Fertilizer application contributed the most to carbon emissions from WMSs in the HFR, accounting for 34.5% of the total carbon emissions. Thus, an efficient way to reduce the carbon footprint is to reduce the difference in nitrogen application between farmers’ and high-yield fields. The dominant WMS production unit in the HFR is smallholding, which requires large resource inputs and high carbon consumption for high yield. Therefore, optimizing the carbon input management of farmers’ fields, especially the management of fertilizers, is crucial for promoting high-yield, low-carbon production and improving ecological benefits for WMS smallholders in the HFR, which will further promote clean and sustainable agricultural production in this region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon balance; Carbon footprint; Cleaner production; Resource utilization efficiency; Sustainable intensification; Wheat-maize cropping systems","Agriculture; Efficiency; Emission control; Fertilizers; Life cycle; Carbon balance; Cleaner production; Cropping systems; Resource utilizations; Sustainable intensification; Carbon footprint",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074405183

Box 4300, Oulu, 90014, Finland","Supply chain risk management has been well researched over the years. However, management of social risks in bioenergy supply chains has been studied less in contemporary research. The ability of bioenergy companies to identify, properly address, and communicate social sustainability has become crucial for many global producers. In order to meet current EU's energy and climate targets, the development of sustainable bioenergy production is vital. However, over last decade, research of bioenergy production supply chains has indicated that upstream areas of global bioenergy production systems are vulnerable in terms of social sustainability risks. The main objective of this research was to demonstrate how the socially sustainable supply chain practices in bioenergy supply chains can help a production company manage social risks and resources-use related conflicts upstream of the supply chain. These practices can be applied in the process of negotiation between bioenergy producers, local authorities, and communities for creating win-win situations for all parties while planning new bioenergy production systems. This study pays special attention to social sustainability risks at the upstream of the supply chain in countries of raw material origin. Use of social sustainability practices intends to help identify, assess, and address social risks of supply chain activities for bioenergy companies. Moreover, such practices aim at supporting companies and their stakeholders in making right choices and preparing effective strategies ahead of time. We based our research on empirical evidence and offer solutions to multi-national bioenergy production companies on how to manage social risks, allowing them to make the right decisions and necessary adjustments before entering potential markets. Our findings show that even avoidance of market entrance can carry sustainability-related social risks for both the company and the local communities. We suggest that although the financial element plays an important role in decision-making, the no-go decision often means missed opportunities for local communities to improve their respective sustainability states. © 2019 by the authors.

The food demand will increase and agricultural activities need modification to satisfy the hunger and nutrition requirements of this up-surging population. The demand for productive agricultural land will be increased. The environmentally sustainable system needs to be introduced to maintain the level of production and the quality of food. The increasing greenhouse gases are the cause of climate change, due to industrialization. The agricultural activities are particularly affected by the environmental issues, including climatic alterations, increasing scarcity of water resource. The movement of populations from rural to urban areas will increase the burden on resources. That is the reason the agricultural practices needed to be renewed by undertaking the ecological, economic, and social aspects of agriculture sector. Moreover, the food and nutrition requirements in the increasing population of developing and resource-scarce countries, especially in Asia and Africa is a challenge. These countries are already poor and resource scarce, and the phenomenon of climate change is adding further challenges for the agriculture practice of small-scale farmers. This review presents the science-based evidence of climate change effect on crops. So the sustainable modifications in agricultural activities should be made by keeping in view these effects. The concept of sustainable practices is distributed in four categories such as agrarian farming, health and nutrition valve, sustainability of ecosystems, and prosperity of the populations and associated factors. The formulation and implementation of policies along with initiatives to mitigate and adapt to the climatic variations. The strategy of agro-biodiversity can be effective to overcome these problems associated with increasing population and climate change.

One of the principal challenges for multiphase flow models, in terms of uncertainty, is the difference in scale and some of the fluid properties between field and laboratory conditions. Therefore, the models may become unreliable when they are applied to conditions that are very different from those in the laboratory. IFE (Institute for Energy Technology) has recently developed and demonstrated scale-up rules for the most basic multiphase pipe flows. The objective of the work presented in this paper was to select appropriate data from our existing database and design new, scaled laboratory experiments, well-suited to demonstrate (or test) the scaling rules by comparing the results. The data include fluid properties, pipe configurations and flow rates. Besides the observed flow pattern, liquid holdup and pressure gradient are the two main parameters for comparison. IFE's CO2 Flow Loop with a test section inner diameter (ID) of 44 mm, operates for two-phase flows over a large range of pressures and temperatures on the equilibrium line of pure CO2. In order to verify scale-up principles, series of experiments were conducted according to the scaling rules to simulate similar conditions. The experiments were performed with gas–liquid two-phase CO2 for fully-developed, steady-state flow, in a horizontal or near-horizontal pipe. The flow regimes include stratified and annular flows. The experimental results showed that measurements of liquid holdup, and pressure gradient in the CO2 Flow Loop are in excellent agreement with appropriately scaled data from the larger-scale facilities. The results also confirm that the gas-to-liquid density ratio plays an important role. The experiments provide valuable data sets for verifying scaling laws, which are lacking in the literature. © 2019","Dimensionless analysis; Experimental study; Multiphase flow; Scaling principles","Carbon dioxide; Density of gases; Flow patterns; Laboratories; Liquids; Multiphase flow; Pipe flow; Pressure gradient; Dimensional analysis; Dimensionless analysis; Experimental study; Laboratory conditions; Methodology evaluation; Multi-phase flow models; Multiphase pipe flow; Scaling principle; Two phase flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073250958

Under the framework of IMO, some areas have established strict emission control areas (ECAs) to reduce emissions, which mainly contain Europe and North America. To further strengthen the control and supervision over air pollutants from shipping activities, the Sulfur cap regulation of 0.5% by mass will come into effect on 1 January, 2020 globally, when all the sailing vessels on the high sea should use fuels with sulfur content less than 0.5%. This limit is stricter for the global recognized sulfur emission control areas (SECAs), where it was 0.1% since 1 January 2015. However, Chinese local SECA lags behind the globally recognized SECAs, where the 0.5% Sulfur cap was implemented from 2016 and it has to be strengthened along with the global sulfur cap 2020. These increasingly stringent emission regulations have huge effects on shipping operators. The current study discusses the potential impacts of the stricter sulfur cap on operators' compliance option choices, where fuel-switching and scrubber system are analyzed under different sulfur limits. Meanwhile, the slow steaming practice is incorporated into the fuel-switching option by considering speed differentiation in different sulfur limit areas. This study develops a cost-minimizing model using NPV (net present value) method. It analyzes the optimal option within vessels' lifespan considering the tradeoff between the initial investment and future operational cost for newbuilding vessels based on a case study. In addition, emissions of CO2 and SOx are compared under different compliance options in different sulfur cap scenarios. Our results find that the scrubber system is a suitable option to comply with the 0.5% global sulfur limit, and a higher efficiency of sulfur abatement can be attained by the scrubber system option. However, it emits more carbon emissions due to higher energy consumption used by the scrubber system. In addition, the effects of additional vessels deployed in the cycle on the compliance choices are also demonstrated in the analysis. © 2019 by the authors.","Compliance option; Emission reduction; Seca; Shipping industry; Sulfur limit","carbon dioxide; compliance; cost analysis; differentiation; emission control; investment incentive; operations technology; shipping; sulfur emission; supply vessel; Europe; North America; Nucleopolyhedrovirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079605566

Solid wastes, consumption of fuel wood, and petroleum products were identified as major materials being combusted in Lagos and these materials were quantified based on the information in literature. Annual emissions from the combustion of the quantified materials were estimated using emission factor approach. The total estimated annual contribution of anthropogenic combustion processes to atmospheric loading of PM10, CO, SO2, NOx and VOC were 188.49, 5920.97, 11.24, 348.88 and 4.14 kt/annum, respectively. Emissions from the combustion of solid waste/biomass were identified as a major source of criteria air pollutants in the city because, about 67.5% and 82% of the estimated CO and PM10 emissions, respectively, were generated from the combustion of solid waste/biomass. Also, 81%, 57% and 32% of NOx, SO2 and CO emissions respectively were found to have emanated from combustion of kerosene. These elevated emission levels can be said to have potential impacts on ambient air quality of the study area. The study concluded that immediate mitigating action to reduce release of pollutants from combustion processes should be put in place. © 2020 The Author(s).

The UK's recent adoption of a net zero target by 2050 signals an increase in ambition in heat decarbonisation targets. On the other hand, negative emissions from the power sector, in the form of bioelectricity with carbon capture and storage (BECCS), could provide both low-carbon firm power and CO2 removal, to assist in this transition. Our study explores the role of CO2 removal in least cost electrification pathways to net zero, using a spatially explicit hourly unit operation and capacity expansion optimisation model of the UK heat and power sectors. We model the full biomass and CCS value chains to account for potential geo-physical, sustainability and financial constraints to BECCS deployment at the regional level.

To preserve the rainforest ecosystems within the Yasuni-ITT oil block, the release of 410 million metric tons of CO2 would have been avoided. The neologism ""yasunization"" emerged as an Amazonian narrative on ""unburnable carbon"" to be replicated worldwide. Considering the unburnable carbon, petroleum-associated gas flaring represents the unleakable part. Flaring is an irrational practice that consists of burning waste gases, representing not only a leak of energy but also a pollution source. The general aim of the paper is to monitor gas flaring as a tool, revealing, at the same time, the implementation of environmental technologies in the oil sector and the compliance of sustainable policies in the Amazon region and the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve. Specific objectives are: (i) identifying and estimating gas flaring over seven years (2012-2018); (ii) mapping new flaring sites; iii) estimating potentially affected areas among ecosystems and local communities. We processed National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Nightfire annual dataset, based on the elaboration of imagery from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) and developed a GIS-based novel simple method to identify new flaring sites from daily detections. We found that 23.5% of gas flaring sites and 18.4% of volumes of all oil industries operating in Ecuador are located within the Yasuni Biosphere Reserve (YBR). Moreover, we detected 34 additional flaring sites not included in the NOAA dataset-12 in the YBR and one in Tiputini field, a key area for biological and cultural diversity conservation.

Participants were drawn from Senior Secondary 1–3 students, as well as their teachers, all from secondary schools across the rural and urban geographical divide. Sociographical factors that have considerable effects on awareness of climate change and willingness to adopt pro-environmental behaviour were ascertained using the instrument “Awareness of Climate Change and Pro-Environmental Behaviour Willingness Questionnaire (ACCPEBWQ),” made up of 44 items on a 4-point Likert type format. A sample of 312 students and 56 teachers was used for the study with descriptive, mean, t test, ANOVA statistics, and correlation techniques employed in data analysis. Gender of students shows a significant difference in awareness of climate change and willingness to embrace pro-environmental behaviour, with male students showing both higher awareness and willingness to engage in pro-environmental behaviour. For teachers, though no significant effects were established for different variables tested in the study, they had a significantly higher awareness of climate change mean scores than students. There was a high positive and significant relationship between the level of awareness of climate change and the level of willingness to adopt pro-environmental behaviour. The study calls for increased dissemination of climate change information among females and the association of climate change issues pto prevalent environmental conditions, for better comprehension by art students. © 2020, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change awareness; climate change education; pro-environmental behaviour","climate change; education; questionnaire survey; student; teaching; Enugu [Nigeria]; Nigeria; Nsukka",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073939027

Laboratory-scale semi-continuous anaerobic reactors were operated at 35°C. The operational performance and quality of the final stabilized sludge were monitored. PS and SS showed opposite thickening abilities exhibiting a need for direct feeding of PS to the digesters. Biodegradability was obtained as 52(±1) and 40(±5)% volatile solid (VS) removal for PS and SS, respectively. Optimum VLR was determined according to the highest methane yield (specific methane production), VS reduction and dewaterability of the stabilised sludge. An inhibitory effect was observed at higher VLRs in PS digestion inducing a gradual reduction in the methane yield and daily production. High oil and grease content was subject to a substantial reduction in PS digestion showing a dependency on HRT. Conversely, a considerable degree of augmentation took place in the stabilised SS with no correlation to HRT at values lower than 30 d. Efficient reduction in the oil and grease content improved dewaterability in stabilised PS whereas high oil and grease content prevented an improvement for stabilised SS. Major benefits were obtained as lower HRT and high stability with higher methane production and fertilizing (N and P content) characteristics for digestion performance and stabilized SS, whereas direct feeding and higher HRT for PS digestion were determined as beneficial. © The Author(s).","Anaerobic; Dewaterability; Methane; Operation; Primary; Secondary; Sewage sludge; Stabilization","Anaerobic digestion; Biodegradability; Methane; Sewage sludge; Stabilization; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic; Dewaterability; Operation; Primary; Secondary; Sludge digestion; anaerobic digestion; anoxic conditions; biodegradation; bioreactor; dewatering; feasibility study; methane; operations technology; sewage; sludge; stabilization; wastewater; wastewater treatment plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082107521

The goal is to minimize, simultaneously, three objective functions, Z1 (CO2 emissions), Z2 (Other Types of Emissions), and Z3 (total costs), for a buses fleet of a transit agency. For this case, there were four types of buses (diesel, electric bus, electric bus of fast charging, and CNG (compressed natural gas bus), which were analyzed in three different lines (South-North, Itinga, and South-Central) in Joinville city, Brazil. The respective data were modeled and optimized using MS Excel. Two different scalarization methods (the Weighted Tchebycheff and the Augmented Weighted Tchebycheff) are used for solving this buses fleet management problem. Different tradeoffs, in terms of the objectives, were obtained. The choice of a bus type is directly related to the characteristics (number of stops, average speed among others) of each line. The electrical bus is the best choice for reducing emissions but has a high initial cost and low autonomy. The results indicate that in the South–North line due to the large number of stops and low average speed, the electric bus is the type of dominant.

The use of unsuitable water sources for irrigation may increase salinisation risks. However, few if any policy assessments and research efforts have been directed at investigating how farmer perceptions mediate spillovers from the ubiquitous irrigation adaptation strategy. In this study, the cognitive failure and/or bias construct is examined and proposed as an analytical lens in research, policy, and learning and the convergence of disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation discourses. A cross-sectional survey design and multistage stratified sampling were used to collect data from 69 households. To elicit the environmental impacts of irrigation practices, topsoil and subsoils from irrigated and non-irrigated sites were sampled and analysed using AAS (atomic absorption spectrophotometer). A generalised linear logistic weight estimation procedure was used to analyse the perception of risks while an analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyse changes in exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP). The findings from small-scale farmers in Machakos and Kakamega counties, Kenya, suggest multifaceted biases and failures about the existence and importance of externalities in adaptation planning discourses. Among other dimensions, a cognitive failure which encompasses fragmented approaches among institutions for use and management of resources, inadequate policy. and information support, as well as the poor integration of actors in adaptation planning accounts for adaptation failure. The failures in such human-environment system interactions have the potential to exacerbate the existing vulnerability of farmer production systems in the long run. The findings further suggest that in absence of risk message information dissemination, education level, farming experience, and information accumulation, as integral elements to human capital, do not seem to have a significant effect on behaviour concerning the mitigation of environmental spillovers. Implicitly, reversing the inherent adaptation failures calls for system approaches that enhance coordinated adaptation planning, prioritise the proactive mitigation of slow-onset disaster risks, and broadens decision support systems such as risk information dissemination integration, into the existing adaptation policy discourses and practice. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptation failure; Adaptation planning; Climate change; Economic interests; Ecosystem spillovers; Policy; Risk perception; Transformation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078834395

Solar thermochemical conversion approaches rely on the absorption of radiative energy by a solid catalytic medium. The direct absorption of solar energy by CO2 before reaching the catalyst could lead to more efficient conversion. Greater solar photon absorption can be achieved through the use of an electrical discharge to drive CO2 to a low-temperature plasma state in which free electrons and heavy-species are in a state of Non-Local Thermodynamic-Equilibrium (NLTE). The absorption of solar energy by a plasma-enhanced solar reactor for atmospheric pressure CO2 conversion is analyzed via zero- and one-dimensional models. The models are comprised by the spectral radiative transfer equation (RTE) and energy conservation equations for electrons and heavy-species. Radiative properties are computed by a line-by-line radiative code and transport properties using kinetic theory. Simulation results for a representative 10 cm long solar-plasma reactor show up to 48% and 90% net-absorption of solar radiation by CO2 in NLTE at electron temperatures of 1 and 2 eV, respectively, and heavy-species temperatures of ~2000 K, common in solar thermochemical processes. In contrast, less than 0.2% of solar radiation is absorbed by CO2 in LTE under similar conditions. The results suggest that solar-plasma direct-receiver reactors, due to increased direct solar energy absorption, have the potential for greater efficiency CO2 decomposition processes. © 2019 International Solar Energy Society","Nonequilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma; Radiative transfer; Solar absorption; Solar fuels","Atmospheric pressure; Computation theory; Conservation; Electric discharges; Electron temperature; One dimensional; Plasma applications; Radiative transfer; Solar energy; Solar radiation; Solar wind; Temperature; Absorption of solar radiation; Energy conservation equations; Nonequilibrium atmospheric pressure plasma; Radiative Transfer Equation(RTE); Solar absorption; Solar fuels; Solar thermochemical process; Thermodynamic non-equilibrium; Carbon dioxide; absorption; atmospheric pressure; carbon dioxide; catalysis; equilibrium; radiative transfer; solar power; solar radiation; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075621483

The COVID-19 pandemic has huge impacts on most aspects of human activities, as well as on the economy and health care systems. Lock-downs, quarantines and border closures in the wake of the pandemic have led to reductions in air pollution through decreased travel and production. These positive environmental effects are likely mostly temporary, but may serve as an example that changes in our way of life can have prompt positive effects for the environment and demonstrate the usefulness of travel-reducing measures such as teleconferencing.

Violence remains a critical public health issue with 8.1% of elementary and 21.8% of middle school students reporting daily or weekly bullying in 2015-16. Similarly, over half of lifetime mental health concerns become evident before age 14. Thus, elementary school is a key time for comprehensive school safety interventions. Yet, interventions are rarely delivered with fidelity in community settings. Evidence-based interventions must be complemented by implementation strategies to achieve desired public health outcomes. Methods: We develop and test an intervention focused on promoting a positive school climate guided by a school-based 3-person leadership team (3-PLT) using a hybrid Type II design. The 3-PLT includes a School Resource Officer, (SRO), administrator and mental health services professional as a newly appointed climate specialist (CS). The interventions to be delivered include 1) Restorative justice, 2) Mental Health First Aid and 3) Crime Prevention Through Environmental Design. The CS will lead the team and coordinate implementation through a process of interactive problem solving and supports, consistent with the implementation facilitation strategy. We will conduct a cluster randomized controlled trial with staged entry over two school years in Genesee County, Michigan (n = 20 elementary schools, with 10 participating per school year). We will use a combination of data sources including data collected by schools (e.g., discipline data), a student survey, and a teacher survey. We will also conduct a process evaluation and assess implementation and sustainability through focus groups with key stakeholders, teachers, and students. Finally, we will conduct a cost-benefit analysis. Discussion: Results from both the behavioral outcome and implementation strategy evaluations are expected to have significant implications for school safety and student well-being. This study adopts a unique approach by integrating three evidence-based programs and incorporating implementation facilitation led by the CS as part of the 3-PLT to support intervention delivery and enhance public health impact among schools in disadvantaged communities with students at risk of poor health outcomes.

The interaction of these deep reservoirs of carbon with the surface reservoir (atmosphere and oceans) leads to a habitable surface environment, with an equitable atmospheric composition and comfortable range in temperature that together have allowed life to proliferate. The Earth in Five Reactions project (part of the Deep Carbon Observatory program) identified the most important carbon-bearing reactions of our planet, defined as those which perhaps make our planet unique among those in our Solar System, to highlight and review how the deep and surface carbon cycles connect. Here we review the important reactions that control the concentration of carbon dioxide in our atmosphere: outgassing from magmas during volcanic eruptions and during magmatic activity; and uptake of CO2 by alkaline surface waters.

However, it is also a harmful pollutant for humans, and strict emissions legislation motivates research on how to control soot formation and release. The formation of soot is known to be triggered by high temperature and high pressure during combustion, and it is also strongly influenced by the local stoichiometry. The current study investigates how the formation of soot is affected by increasing the oxygen concentration in the oxidizer, since this affects both the temperature profile and partial pressures of reactants. The oxygen-to-fuel ratio is kept constant, i.e., the total flow rate of the oxidizer decreases with increasing oxygen concentration. Propane is combusted (80 kWth) while applying oxygen-enriched air, and in-flame measurements of the temperature and gas concentrations are performed and combined with available soot measurements. The results show that increasing the oxygen concentration in the oxidizer from 21% to 27% slightly increases soot formation, due to higher temperatures or the lower momentum of the oxidizer. At 30% oxygen, however, soot formation increases by orders of magnitude. Detailed reaction modeling is performed and the increase in soot formation is captured by the model. Both the soot inception rates and surface growth rates are significantly increased by the changes in combustion conditions, with the increase in soot inception being the most important. Under atmospheric conditions, there is a distinct threshold for soot formation at around 1200 °C for equivalence ratios >3. The increase in temperature, and the slower mixing that results from the lower momentum of the oxidizer, have the potential to push the combustion conditions over this threshold when the oxygen concentration is increased. © 2020 by the authors.

Ocean basins emerging during the Early Cretaceous break-up of Gondwana were primary sites of organic carbon burial, implying that their tectonic and oceanographic evolution may have affected trends and perturbations in global climate via changes in local organic carbon burial. Assessing the role of individual ocean basins in the global carbon-climate context requires a sound understanding of the processes that induced large-scale changes in carbon burial and the timing of these changes. Here we reconstruct the oceanographic evolution, and its links to organic carbon burial, in the Barremian to Albian South Atlantic and Southern Ocean basins, which may have acted as carbon sinks of global importance. Our reconstruction is based on combined seawater neodymium isotope and sedimentological records obtained from multiple deep sea drill sites and a new general circulation model. Deep water circulation within and between those basins was primarily controlled by the opening of the shallow Falkland Plateau Gateway (between ∼118 Ma and ∼113 Ma) and the deep Georgia Basin Gateway (by ∼110 Ma), for which we provide new age constraints based on biostratigraphic and carbon isotope data. The opening of these gateways was accompanied by local to basin-wide decreases in organic carbon burial, suggesting that ocean circulation affected the oxygenation state via changes in deep water ventilation. Although our data do not provide quantitative information on the impact of changes in regional organic carbon burial on the global carbon cycle, the synchronicity between the reduction of organic carbon burial in the South Atlantic basin and global warming during the Early Albian points to a strong causal relationship. © 2019","Early Cretaceous; gateways; neodymium isotopes; ocean circulation; organic carbon burial; South Atlantic","Deepwater drilling; Gateways (computer networks); Global warming; Isotopes; Oceanography; Early Cretaceous; Neodymium isotopes; Ocean circulation; Organic carbon burial; South Atlantic; Organic carbon; Albian; Barremian; burial (geology); carbon sink; neodymium isotope; ocean basin; oceanic circulation; organic carbon; reconstruction; seawater; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (South); Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074408192

The project's concept of transforming the problem into a resource by preventing eutrophication through biogas production has several benefits for the region: removal of phosphorus and nitrogen from the Baltic Sea and their return to arable land (phosphorus is a limited resource to be saved for future food production); improved coastal recreation values and, in the long term, the regional economy; reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from algae. Algae can provide bioenergy not only from agricultural land, but from our seas and oceans. Seaweed can be used to purify nutrient-enriched water (associated with salmon, for example, on farms). Many species of seaweed can be classified in many ways, for instance, by color. Genetic difference between green seaweed Ulva lactuca and brown seaweed Fucus is quite large. U. lactuca has a high sulfur content and usually has a carbon to nitrogen (C: N) ratio of less than 10, which makes anaerobic fermentation difficult. To determine the potential of biogas from different seaweeds of the Gulf of Riga, a study was carried out using laboratory equipment. In the study, 16 different bioreactors fermented at 38 oC three different types of algae most common in the Gulf of Riga, taken from shore-washed seaweed piles. On average, fermentation for 32 days yielded 0.276L·g-1dom biogas (0.046 L·g-1dom methane) from brown algae, and 0.248 L·g-1dom biogas (0.027 L·g-1dom methane) from red algae. An average of 0.425 L·g-1dom biogas (0.071L·g-1dom methane) was obtained from green algae. The study shows that long-lived algae can be obtained in small amounts of methane per unit dry organic matter from land-littered ponds, if no measures are taken to condition them. © 2020 Latvia University of Life Sciences and Technologies.

Studies based on European statistical surveys have often highlighted the magnitude of the problem in the region, and all European countries have been asked to acknowledge the prevalence of energy poverty in their Energy and Climate Plans that were due in December 2019. However, the topic of energy poverty seems to enter the policy debates of many European countries only slowly. The present chapter discusses some factors that might explain the slow recognition of energy poverty in post-communist Europe. It was developed from discussions among energy poverty experts that took place at various ENGAGER COST meetings and during the work on this book. Its central argument is that many problems related to energy poverty do not come to the forefront of national debates because some of their aspects have so little visibility to national policy-makers. The chapter is structured as follows. The first section discusses the lack of visibility of energy poverty symptoms to policy-makers, which implies that efforts must be made to find out what energy poverty is. The second section analyses the variety of energy poverty drivers and context factors and shows that many determinants of energy poverty are influenced not by individual characteristics of households but by factors that are part of the larger context, whether national or regional. Finally, the third section discusses some of these context factors which might be particularly relevant in the case of post-communist Europe. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, George Jiglau, Anca Sinea, Ute Dubois, and Philipp Biermann; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096258118

To understand how these calls may be useful requires exploring how they are mediated by both global and national climate governance architectures. Globally, the Paris Agreement architecture is premised on a learning by doing logic that prioritizes experimentation. National governance mechanisms have emerged in reaction to such international processes, but are deeply shaped by local contexts. National systems differ in the narratives on which they are based, their institutional forms, and the resultant interests mobilized. Specifically, they differ in the centrality of climate change itself to national narratives of action and, instead, often embed climate motivations within other national objectives. As a result, calls for enhanced ambition can have different effects depending on how they are framed, and therefore how amenable they are to being internalized nationally. In particular, ambition understood predominantly as enhanced quantitative pledges could yield perverse outcomes truncating the learning by doing dynamic of the Paris Agreement; returning the focus of global political attention disproportionately to a burden-sharing discussion; creating incentives for gaming pledges; and stretching scarce implementation capacity in the developing world. More flexible framings that can harness ambition to accelerated experimentation, broader coalitions, and synergies with other objectives can be fruitful. Questions such as “is it too late?” are useful if they encourage action and learning by doing; less so if they shift attention to future intent over current action.

PEPs allocation at industrial level is critical in promoting industrial restructuring and technological innovation and ensuring effective total emission control. In this study, a bidirectional-coupling optimization model (BCOM) is developed by integrating both forward (focusing on environmental benefits) and backward (focusing on economic benefits) optimization. It is applied to a typical region in China for the allocation of SO2 emission permits among eight key industries in 2020. Under the scheme by BCOM, PEPs for the industries of non-metal and agricultural products will increase 11.6% and 9.2% compared with the 2015 level, which implies that these industries should be encouraged for development. PEPs for the other six industries will all decrease, among which the metal industry has the largest emission reduction rate (34.1%). Emission intensity, growth rate of industrial output and industrial profit rate jointly contribute to differentiated PEPs allocation. The provided interval values of PEPs and industrial output allow flexibility for reshaping the industrial structure. The results of the BCOM are also compared with those of other four alternative allocation methods through comprehensive evaluation to illustrate the robustness of the BCOM with regard to compromising fairness and efficiency and achieving both maximum economic and environmental benefits. The proposed approach and empirical results are expected to offer better decision support to reasonable PEPs allocation and emission reduction at industrial level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental quality; Industrial development; Industrial restructuring; PEPs allocation; Pollutant emission permits (PEPs); Total emission control","Agricultural products; Decision support systems; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Growth rate; Optimization; Environmental quality; Industrial development; Industrial restructuring; PEPs allocation; Pollutant emission; Quality control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072643672

The CARB MRP initially started with basic facility reporting and has grown and adopted to include multiple non-facility specific sectors of the economy, as dictated by the growing initiatives and programs that CARB joins or creates. However, as the program applicability may change, the basics tenants of MRP stay the same with reporting and verification at the center of the program. By having CARB’s C&T Program as a separate program, entities have to navigate if they have a compliance obligation and how they will meet that obligation in addition to complying with reporting requirements. Entities can reduce their emissions by switching to biomass-derived fuels or meeting their compliance obligation by using CARB-provided allowances or purchasing allowances and/or compliance offset credits. As CARB’s programs grow, it will likely trigger similar growth in the western North American GHG programs and regional agreements. As discussed, Québec’s C&T system, which is linked with CARB’s program, has been growing and is being used to meet the Canadian federal GHG rules that are being put in place. Ontario’s program was annulled but shows that the discussion on how best to reduce GHG emission is a topic that continues to thrive, and we may see new programs developing even though some may hit some setbacks. The PCC shows that even if a MRP and C&T Program is not the particular method for chosen by a region to reduce emissions, many regions still see reducing GHG emissions as the future to create jobs, develop the economy, develop new infrastructure and maintain growth while protecting the environment. © 2020 Bracing for Climate Change: Strategies for Mitigation and Resiliency Planning Conference Proceedings.

Monocultures of oil palm have expanded in Southeast Asia, mostly replacing tropical forests. The limited data available have indicated that the land-use conversion is associated with a potentially aggravated GHG burden, including nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions, with unclear underlying biological mechanisms. In this study, we investigated N2O and NO emission potentials of tropical soils with different land-uses from Sabah, Malaysian Borneo, under laboratory incubation. Under similar controlled conditions, logged forest and oil palm soils showed high and similar potentials of N2O and NO emissions following increase in soil moisture, while the emissions were negligible in a riparian reserve soil irrespective of moisture conditions. Soil N2O and NO emission rates from logged forest soils and oil palm (OP) plantations were of similar magnitude, with average fluxes over the 35 and 22 day incubation periods, respectively, of 11.5 and 1.6 ng N g−1 h−1 (OP) and 15.6 and 6.0 ng N g−1 h−1 (logged forest). Contrarily, the riparian reserve soil did not respond to rewetting and nitrogen application and fluxes were negligible. Furthermore, N2O fluxes were on average about 10 times higher than NO fluxes. The fact that forest soils also have the potential to emit large amounts of N2O and NO, has important implications for land-use change scenarios in the tropics, especially as some scenarios suggest atmospheric N deposition is likely to drastically increase in tropical regions due to biomass burning, increased N-fertilizer use and fossil fuel consumption. Quantification of related gene transcripts implied that Proteobacterial nirS and AniA-nirK (betaproteobacterial clade of Neisseria) containing denitrifiers might continuously contribute to the N2O emissions, while the nitrifiers (ammonia oxidizing archaea in this study) are conditionally active to produce N2O. This study therefore provides some evidence for N2O and NO emissions associated with phylogenetically diverse groups of microorganisms, which might be of importance in modulating the GHG emissions under different land-uses and field conditions. © Copyright © 2020 Drewer, Zhao, Leduning, Levy, Sentian, Gubry-Rangin and Skiba.","amoA; AniA; greenhouse gases; logged tropical forest; nirK and nirS; nitrification-denitrification; nosZ; riparian areas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087115225

This paper considers the effect of asymmetric carbon taxation when firms are able to adjust their energy efficiency investment levels to reflect the presence of the tax. Using a dynamic model of firm competition, we find that allowing firms to adjust their energy efficiency levels in response to a carbon tax could potentially allow firms to significantly mitigate the competition effects of that carbon tax. In our baseline parameterization, additional energy efficiency investments non-trivially mitigates profit loss for the firm facing the carbon tax as well as spurring adding energy efficiency investments in the non-taxing jurisdiction, thus reducing carbon leakage. This increase in energy efficiency can potentially reduce total energy usage by the firm in the taxing jurisdiction by more than the carbon tax alone. While the quantitative impact of energy efficiency investments on firm competitiveness depends on the nature of the industry, from a policy standpoint, the ability of energy efficiency investments to mitigate cross-border emissions leakage and negative competition effects without policy interventions such as a carbon border tax softens these two common criticisms of unilateral regional carbon taxes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon leakage; Carbon pricing; Cross-border; Energy efficiency","Carbon; Competition; Emission control; Energy utilization; Investments; Taxation; Asymmetric carbons; Carbon leakage; Carbon pricing; Competition effects; Cross-border; Cross-border emissions; Energy efficiency investments; Policy intervention; Energy efficiency; carbon emission; competition (economics); competitiveness; energy efficiency; environmental economics; investment; pollution tax",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076825029

Moreover, GGNs are associated with a higher malignancy probability. Three-dimensional (3D) segmentation and reconstruction techniques can help physicians intuitively elucidate the relationship between lung nodules and their surrounding tissues. We propose an improved supervoxel 3D region growing approach based on positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) multimodal data for the segmentation and reconstruction of GGNs. First, the seed point is automatically located with PET information and a 3D mask is generated. Then, a fuzzy connectivity (FC) map is generated based on the 3D mask, and an improved supervoxel 3D region growing is utilized on a fuzzy connectivity map under the constraints of the 3D mask. Finally, 3D GGNs segmentation and reconstruction results are obtained. Qualitative and quantitative comparisons between our proposed method and other region growing methods shows great superiority of our proposed method, with the Jaccard similarity coefficient between our proposed method and physician manual segmentation reaching 95.61%; the average processing time is 16.38 s.

However, both anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic disturbances are challenging the sustainability of the QTP's grassland ecosystems in the era of global change. In this review paper, we summarized the causes and effects of grassland degradation, restoration practices used on degraded grasslands, impacts of climate change and nitrogen deposition on plants and soils, adaptation strategies to climate changes, impacts of livestock grazing on plants and soils, and sustainable grazing management on the QTP. We believed that the integration of internal drivers of ecosystem fragility with external disturbances such as overgrazing are the major causes of grassland degradations on the QTP. The quantitative evaluation systems for grassland ecosystem health including plant, soil and livestock indicators are theoretically feasible and technically reliable. The major impacts of grassland degradation on the QTP are loss of biodiversity, increased water erosion, reduced carbon sequestration, decrease pastoral productivity and reduced local human well-being. The current restoration practices are mostly revegetation of “Bare Land” severely degraded grasslands using cultivated grasses. Other restoration practices such as grazing fallow and grassland fencing can be applied to restore the lightly or moderately degraded grasslands. We believed that the side effects from soil drying on plant productivity and diversity in manipulative warming experiments could be the main cause of controversial findings about the effects of climate change on plant productivity, diversity, phenology, soil physics, biochemistry and organisms. Many scholars argued the advances and delays in greening-up date, lengthening and shortening of the growth period in the phenological responses of alpine grassland plants to a warming climate. Multiple sources of remote sensing data and diverse interpretive approaches should be applied and ground-based observations and surveys should be performed to improve the accuracy and reliability of model predictions on plant phenology. Inconsistent conclusions of climate change impacts on soil biochemistry and organisms except soil acidification and eutrophication have been widely observed in most manipulated studies of nitrogen deposition. Adaptive strategies should be employed to promote grassland system's sustainability of the QTP. Rotational grazing regime with moderate grazing intensity in the warm season may retain or promote plant height, cover, productivity and biodiversity, improve soil structure, fertility and microbial biomass, enhance carbon and nitrogen storage and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the alpine grassland ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Grassland degradation; Grassland ecosystems; Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau; Sustainable grazing","acidification; adaptation; biochemistry; climate change; environmental degradation; eutrophication; grassland; grazing management; microbial activity; soil fertility; sustainable development; water erosion; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073165857

However, few residential energy system models have been developed for the sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) region and they do not account for the key diversities of energy use within the sector. This paper addresses this gap by developing a new residential energy model for Nigeria—the most populous country in SSA. The model is then used to explore different energy transition scenarios for the sector. Results indicate that the final energy consumption of the rural households will reduce and that of the urban households will increase significantly by 2050 when compared to the base year levels. The results indicate that cooking remains the most energy-intensive end-use. Analysis of the scenarios reveals that realising Sustainable Development Goal number 7 in Nigeria will drastically reduce the final energy demand of the sector. The transition from fuelwood to liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) for cooking will reduce indoor air pollutants considerably but will increase CO2 emissions by 2050. The results also indicate that including the cost of externalities in energy cost makes electricity and biogas more economically viable options for cooking. While the model results are insightful, the paper argues that robust and dedicated policies are needed for a sustainable energy transition of the Nigerian residential sector. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy policy; Energy transition; Nigeria; Residential sector; SDG 7; TIMES model","Economics; Energy conservation; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Housing; Indoor air pollution; Liquefied petroleum gas; Energy transitions; Nigeria; Residential sectors; SDG 7; TIMES modeling; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074065209

Two principal options exist to reduce emissions: make driving less polluting or reduce driving overall. Though cities have a role to play in both approaches, the levers that may influence the latter more squarely align with municipal competences concerning the urban form. This paper aims to refine our understanding of the relationship between urban form, public transport systems, and driving behavior by exploring whether accessibility—the ease of reaching desired destinations—exerts a different influence on people’s decision to drive on weekdays and total distance driven depending on travel purpose. We relied on disaggregate data from the 2013 Montreal Origin–Destination Survey and employed a two-step “hurdle” approach with multilevel logistic and linear models. We found both local and regional accessibility displayed statistically significant negative correlations with driving mode choice and vehicle distance driven by drivers. Concerning the decision to drive, regional accessibility, defined by transit-accessible jobs, appeared to possess a stronger relationship than local, as measured by Walk Score across all purposes. When considering total kilometers driven, however, the relative impact of both types of accessibility varied. Overall, and for work and school driving, regional accessibility correlated with the greatest declines in distance driven. For healthcare and discretionary travel, local accessibility correlated with a larger decline in total driving distance. Our findings also highlight the potentially profound impact of other explanatory factors, particularly car ownership, suggesting additional policy approaches for municipal decision makers to reduce vehicle kilometers traveled. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",,"Behavioral research; Decision making; Digital storage; Decision makers; Driving behavior; Driving distance; Multi-level logistics; Negative correlation; Policy approach; Public transport systems; Transport emissions; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094883463

Deploying relational understandings of nature-society, space, and power, Brandon Derman shows that climate change has been co-produced with social inequality. Mismatching levels of responsibility and vulnerability, and institutions that emerged in tandem with those disproportionalities compose the terrain on which NGOs and social movements now contest climate injustice in a wide-ranging “politics of connection.” Case-based chapters explore the defining commitments of affected and allied communities, and how they have shaped specific struggles mobilizing human rights, international treaties, transnational activist forums, national and local constituencies, and broad-based demonstrations. Derman synthesizes these cases and similar efforts across the globe to identify and explore crosscutting themes in climate justice politics as well as the opportunities and dilemmas facing advocates and activists, and those who would ally with them going forward. How should we understand campaigns for climate justice? What do these initiatives share, and what differentiates them? What, in fact, does “climate justice” mean in these contexts? And what do the framing and progression of such efforts in different settings suggest about the broader conditions that produce and sustain climate injustice, how those conditions could be unmade, and what might take their place? Struggles for Climate Justice approaches these questions from an interdisciplinary perspective accessible to graduate and advanced undergraduate students as well as scholars of geography, social movements, environmental politics, policy, and socio-legal studies. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088725037

Specifically, we propose the use of blast furnace gas (BFG) as an additional carbon source. The high CO2 and CO content of BFG make it a good carbon resource. In the proposed process, CO2 is recovered from the BFG and blended with H2O, H2, and CH4-rich COG to reform methane. Optimized amounts of H2O and CO2 are used to adjust the (H2 – CO2)/(CO + CO2) molar ratio in order to maximize the amount of methanol that is produced. In addition, the desulphurization process was modified to enable the removal of sulfur compounds, especially thiophene, from the COG. The process design and simulation results reported herein were then used to determine any potential environmental and economic benefits. This research is based on off-gas conditions provided by ArcelorMittal Dofasco (AMD), Hamilton, Ontario. In order to determine which conditions are most desirable for this retrofit strategy, potential greenhouse gas reduction and economic benefits were analyzed. In particular, this analysis focused on the heating utility chosen for methane reformation prior to methanol synthesis. To this end, COG, BFG, and natural gas (NG) were compared. The results showed that using BFG/NG as a heating utility can produce greater economic gains, and that synthesizing COG + BFG to methanol results in greater economic and environmental gains than solely producing electricity (the status quo). Compared to current operating procedures, the proposed process could potentially increase net present values by up to $54 million. The carbon efficiency achieved was up to 72%. An additional 0.73 kg of CO2 from BFG is needed for every 1 kg of MeOH produced. About 52% of feedstock energy is converted to MeOH, with another 33% recovered in the form of utilities. The exergy efficiency of the recommended version of the system is about 61%. The business case for converting CO2 into methanol highly depends on the local electricity grid carbon intensity. For Ontario, it can reduce direct CO2 emissions by 228 ktonne per year, and fix up to 246 ktonne CO2 into methanol per year. In addition, analyses of location effects, CO2 taxes, electricity prices, electricity carbon intensity, methanol prices, and income taxes indicated that MeOH production is highly recommended for Ontario, Mexico, the USA, and China applications. For USA, build MeOH plant is recommended for Finland, whether to do this retrofit or not is inconclusive. For Finland, the results are inconclusive, other strategies may be equally suitable.

However, studies conducted worldwide have shown that the magnitude of these losses depends on the management practices adopted as well as climate and soil conditions; thus, accurately quantifying these SOC changes can be a major challenge. In this regard, the aim of this study was to derive specific SOC stock change factors for conventional farming systems in the semi-arid region of Brazil and to evaluate the impacts caused by the conventional systems of annual crops throughout time and soil profile on SOC stocks in this region. A total of 66 pairs of comparisons were used, and datasets were analyzed through a mixed linear model.

Despite its socioeconomic importance, the genesis of this soil class has not yet been fully elucidated. This study was conducted with the aim of improving knowledge about the genesis of Planosols under a semi-arid climate. Three Planosol profiles on the Borborema Plateau in NE Brazil were collected, classified, and described morphologically, and the main physical and chemical attributes, the pedogenetic forms of iron oxides, and the mineralogical compositions of the sand, silt, and clay fractions were determined. The results indicate that: (a) parent materials richer in feldspar and biotite favor the formation of Planosols with a higher clay content; (b) the dissolution of primary minerals and the formation of clay minerals (known as the argillation process) are fundamental for the genesis of Bt horizons; (c) depth-drainage deficiency leads to hydromorphism, an associated gray color, and the formation of mottles; and (d) monosialitization and bisialitization processes (kaolinite formation and the formation of 2:1 clay minerals, respectively) prevail in Planosols located within landscape positions that have good and poor drainage, respectively. In addition, the present study shows that Planosols under a semi-arid climate can have a clay fraction consisting predominantly of kaolinite, and mineralogical alteration pathways similar to those described in soils under an analogous climate and geology in Northwest Africa; this refutes classical theories that soils with 2:1 clay minerals prevail in warmer and drier regions. This study thus provides greater knowledge about the attributes of Planosols in dry and poor regions and can be used as a reference in studies on the sustainable use and management of such soils. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Argillation; Hydrolysis; Kaolinite; Mineral alteration; Smectite","argillite; geology; hydrolysis; kaolinite; landscape; mineralogy; pedogenesis; Planosol; semiarid region; smectite; subsistence agriculture; sustainability; Africa; Asia; Borborema; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073230687

A discrete event simulation (DES) approach was used to integrate the economic, environmental, and social aspects related to aseptic carton packages (ACP) in Itajuba, Brazil. The simulated scenarios consider three alternatives for disposing ACP: landfills, recycling, and incineration with energy recovery. According to our findings, incineration alternatives are preferred from an eco-efficiency perspective, given the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions and due to the possibility of energy recover, which reinforces the contribution of this technology to promote sustainability as largely found in the international literature. Given the context of MSW management in Brazil, this represents a significant opportunity to increase the effectiveness of mitigation strategies adopted in the country. Taking into account that this is by far the least applied technology, the authors strongly advocate that global strategies for mitigation consider different approaches to integrate carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reductions related to the entire MSW management system and its alternatives, thus advancing from a waste disposal-oriented system to a life cycle–oriented system. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Discrete event simulation; Environmental assessment; Municipal solid waste management; Reverse logistics; Sustainability; Triple bottom line","decision making; emission control; greenhouse gas; incineration; municipal solid waste; recycling; strategic approach; sustainability; waste disposal; waste management; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064245582

Some of the solutions to reduce emission levels, such as electrified powertrains, may not be affordable for emergent markets due to the necessity of investments on infrastructure as well as high costs of some technologies. Bogotá city in Colombia is renewing its bus rapid transit (BRT) fleet and aims to reduce emission levels in its operation. Therefore, the development of a biarticulated bus driven by a compressed natural gas (CNG) Otto engine can be a sustainable solution for such application reducing both emission levels and fuel costs (compared to a Diesel model). However, the development of a cooling system for such bus becomes a challenge due to several factors that have a negative impact on cooling performance such as: high gross train weight (GTW); high altitude application; CNG Otto engine (compared to a Diesel model) and limited space for radiators/coolers on a front engine layout. Since tests during development phase could not be carried out at high altitude, engine cooling simulations were carried out for different vehicle configurations with varying ambient pressure to obtain a correction curve for engine cooling capacity at different barometric pressures. Then, development tests were carried out at low altitude on a prototype bus and later verification measurements were carried out at high altitude on a demonstration bus. Results from the measurements presented good correlation with the correction curve obtained by simulations and therefore can be applied in future developments. © 2019 SAE International.

However, implementing these systems has been challenging, particularly due to uncertainties in local energy demand and renewable energy generation, which imply uncertain operational costs. In this work we are implementing a Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model for the operation of a DES, and analysing impacts of uncertainties in electricity demand, heating demand and solar irradiance on the main model output, the total daily operational cost, using Global Sensitivity Analysis (GSA). Representative data from a case study involving nine residential areas at the University of Surrey are used to test the model for the winter season. Distribution models for uncertain variables, obtained through statistical analysis of raw data, are presented. Design results show reduced costs and emissions, whilst GSA results show that heating demand has the largest influence on the variance of total daily operational cost. Challenges and design limitations are also discussed. Overall, the methodology can be easily applied to improve DES design and operation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","design and operation; Distributed energy system; global sensitivity analysis; mixed-integer linear programming; optimisation",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092794899

Aims: We evaluated differences in tree species composition and richness, and above-ground carbon stocks among dominant land cover types in Pará state, Brazil. Methods: We quantified tree species composition and richness and above-ground carbon stock in stands in remnant primary rain forest, young secondary forest, oil palm plantation and pastures. Results: We sampled 5,696 trees with a DBH ≥ 2 cm, of 413 species in 68 families, of which 381 species were recorded in primary forest fragments. We found significant differences in species richness and carbon stock among the four land cover classes. Carbon stocks in remnant primary forest were typically over 190 Mg ha−1, while those in other land cover types were typically less than 60 Mg ha−1. Conclusion: Oil palm plantations have a species-poor tree community given active management; old plantations have a standing carbon stock which is comparable to that of secondary forest and far greater than that of pastures.

This article integrates the findings presented in the Oil Sands Forest Health Special Issue, which reports on the results of 20 years of forest health monitoring, and addresses the key questions asked by WBEA's Forest Health Monitoring (FHM) Program: 1) is there evidence of deposition affecting the environment?, 2) have there been changes in deposition or effects over time?, 3) do acid deposition levels require management intervention?, 4) what are major sources of deposited substances? and 5) how can the program be improved? Deposition of sulphur, nitrogen, base cations (BC), polycyclic aromatic compounds and trace elements decline exponentially with distance from sources. There is little evidence for acidification effects on forest soils or on understory plant communities or tree growth, but there is evidence of nitrogen accumulation in jack pine needles and fertilization effects on understory plant communities. Sulphur, BC and trace metal concentrations in lichens increased between 2008 and 2014. Source apportionment studies suggest fugitive dust in proximity to mining is a primary source of BC, trace element and organic compound deposition, and BC deposition may be neutralizing acidifying deposition. Sulphur accumulation in soils and nitrogen effects on vegetation may indicate early stages of acidification. Deposition estimates for sites close to emissions sources exceed proposed regulatory trigger levels, suggesting a detailed assessment of acidification risk close to the emission sources is warranted. However, there is no evidence of widespread acidification as suggested by recent modeling studies, likely due to high BC deposition. FHM Program evolution should include continued integration with modeling approaches, ongoing collection and assessment of monitoring data and testing for change over time, and addition of monitoring sites to fill gaps in regional coverage. © 2019 The Authors","Acid deposition; Adaptive monitoring; Ecological monitoring; Fertilization; Jack pine forest","Acidification; Air pollution; Aromatic compounds; Deposition; Health; Integration testing; Meteorological problems; Monitoring; Nitrogen; Oil sands; Risk assessment; Soils; Trace analysis; Trace elements; Acid deposition; Adaptive monitoring; Ecological monitoring; Fertilization; Jack pine; Forestry; nitrogen dioxide; polycyclic aromatic compound; sulfuric acid; trace element; nitrogen; organic compound; sulfur; acidification; adaptive management; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; coniferous forest; ecological approach; environmental monitoring; fertilization (reproduction); forest health; acid deposition; acidification; Article; Athabaskan (people); atmospheric deposition; bioaccumulation; concentration (parameter); ecosystem monitoring; environmental health; environmental release; forest soil; jack pine needle; lichen (organism); mining; nonhuman; plant community; priority journal; program development; risk factor; soil fertilization; tar sand; tree growth; vegetation; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; forest; oil and gas field; pine; theoretical model; tree; Alberta; Athabasca Oil Sands; Canada; Pinus banksiana; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Lichens; Models, Theoretical; Nitrogen; Oil and Gas Fields; Organic Chemicals; Pinus; Sulfur; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074261143

The empirical results show that the effect of corruption on CO2 emissions is indeed heterogeneous and contradictory. Specifically, results exhibit that due to immature economic system, and policy paralysis, corruption penetrates the developing economies, and eventually cause carbon emission and pollution. Furthermore, results reveal that FDI guided by clean development mechanism and involved in emission reduction projects in the developing economies play a predominant role to curb the CO2 emission, pollution, and environmental degradation. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

The Indian government, as in many other countries, responded to the COVID-19 pandemic by enforcing a variety of restrictions on normal activity, including complete lockdowns that led to severe disruptions in economic activities. A beneficial short-term effect on the natural environment across cities was a significant reduction in air pollution. The pandemic and its management, have brought home the interconnectedness between nature and human existence with renewed understanding of the complex linkages between the economy and the environment. This presents a unique opportunity to integrate air pollution management into plans for economic recovery. This paper empirically examines the impact of imposing a 27-day lockdown on air pollution in India by comparing pollutant concentration data from 8 representative cities over matching periods of time during the lockdown with those of the previous year, and the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). This provides an opportunity to understand the maximum extent to which air pollution could potentially be reduced in these cities. Thereafter, these findings are analysed in conjunction with city level socio-economic correlates and current air pollution management strategies, to gain policy insights on the scope for integrating improved air quality with economic recovery for a sustainable future. With city action plans having been recently prepared for improving air quality, this is indeed an appropriate time to conduct analyses to impact and bend the curve of air pollution substantially. Additionally, as winter approaches, there is a possibility of a double burden of mortality and morbidity from worsening of both COVID-19 and air quality. The current focus on public health provides an opportunity to concentrate on the management of air pollution as a critical component of public health management. © 2020 The Authors","Air pollution; Cities; Clean air policy; COVID-19; India; Sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104070110

Several European directives and national regulations have introduced more strict energy performance requirements for new buildings. However, in order to reach the ambitious target of a decarbonised building stock by 2050, the focus is progressively shifted on the renovation of existing buildings. Building stock modelling is a valuable tool for mapping the current state and for accessing different energy conservation measures towards the national targets for 2030 and beyond. This work exploits a bottom-up model for the Hellenic residential building stock to estimate the energy use and access energy savings from various measures and renovation rates towards 2030. The calculations assess the energy performance of typical buildings, and the results are then projected to the building stock. For more realistic estimates of the energy use, the predictions are adapted using updated empirical factors. The model estimates the actual energy use for heating and domestic hot water with acceptable accuracy when compared against officially reported data. The results from the analysis of various scenarios reveal that the 2030 target may be reached with combined measures that improve the envelope and system performance, with relatively high annual renovation rates. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Building stock modelling; Energy conservation methods; Energy use; Refurbishment; Residential buildings",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088728703

For a realistic assessment of the potential for energy consumption and emissions reduction in the built sector, a life cycle approach is deemed necessary. However, the contribution of the embodied energy (EE) and related carbon emissions associated with the building lifespan from the early construction phase to its demolition has more often than not been neglected. This work contributes to the existing knowledge on the role of EE in the lifetime primary energy consumption of typical Hellenic residential buildings representing different construction types and vintages. Cradle-to-gate embodied energy coefficients for the most common construction materials have been derived through data analysis from new field surveys and published data from local manufacturing facilities in Greece and compared against international data bases using the Simapro LCA software. Complementary data from the Ecoinvent LCI database have been used where necessary.

In Kashmir Himalaya, Srinagar city is bestowed with a large number of picturesque wetlands. These wetlands are important in regulating ecosystem services such as providing fresh water supplies, food products, fisheries, water purification, harbor biodiversity, and regulation of regional climate. These are also important as socio-economic support systems for the city inhabitants and valued as habitats of migratory birds that visit Kashmir valley from different continents of the world. Owing to the increased rate of anthropogenic activities and anthropogenically driven changes in natural processes, these wetlands are degrading at an alarming rate, seriously affecting their health and water quality. The major threats to wetlands include pollution, land use and land cover changes, urbanization and encroachments, and climate change. The intensive agricultural practices, introduction of exotic species, and changes in hydrological flows during the past few decades have resulted in degradation of wetlands over this region. Sustainable management of wetlands is crucial as these ecosystems offer an array of ecological functions that sustain livelihoods all over the world.

However, the role of social networks remains underexplored as there is only limited empirical evidence of their benefits, particularly for research on adaptation to climate change in developing countries. This paper provides a contribution to this field of research by examining how social networks foster livelihood diversification and resilience in a small rural community in northern Ghana. The study combines semi-structured interviews, focus group discussions and a survey with a range of other participatory methods. The findings show that, people in the studied community have experienced a range of climatic changes with negative impacts on agriculture in the last three decades. These climatic changes have forced community members to diversify their livelihood activities away from crop production and into off-farm and non-farm activities. Our results highlight how the process of diversification is dependent on household participation in various group activities and formal and informal social networks. Further, the households participating in several group activities and social networks had more diverse livelihood strategies and were found to be more resilient to perceived climate changes because they had access to the critical resources (material and non-material) essential for diversification through their networks. Importantly, this study shows how group activities and social networks can also create adverse effects by enforcing exclusion and marginalization among certain groups in the community. In addition, it shows how some diversification strategies are in conflict with others and thus may potentially undermine future adaptive capacity and the resilience of the community as a whole. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","adaptive capacity; climate change adaptation; livelihood diversification; northern Ghana; Social networks; socio-ecological resilience","adaptive management; climate change; crop production; developing world; questionnaire survey; rural population; social network; strategic approach; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063963960

However, land plants are also responsible for wetland assembly and organic carbon burial. The total burial output of carbon via both organic and inorganic deposition must balance input to the exogenic system from volcanic outgassing on million-year time scales. Increased partitioning of carbon burial toward organic carbon and away from inorganic carbon reduces the marine carbonate burial flux, necessitating a lowered total flux of alkalinity to the oceans to maintain mass balance in the Earth's surface carbon cycle. This flux includes the nutrient delivery from the terrestrial vegetation implicated as a driver of marine evolution, extinction, and environmental change including anoxia and black shale formation. Here, the burial of terrestrial organic carbon, first substantially in the Devonian and continuing through to the present, is argued to require a reduction in silicate weathering rates when compared to earlier times, given the independence of volcanic outgassing from weathering on short time scales. Land plants still may cause reductions in steady-state atmospheric CO2 levels, but via increasing the silicate weathering feedback strength, not silicate weathering rates. The mass-balance constraints on the long-term carbon cycle provide a mechanism for linking how land plant evolution simultaneously increased nutrient recycling and weathering efficiency of the Earth's surface. © 2019 Geological Society of America.",,"Nutrients; Organic carbon; Silicates; Volcanoes; Environmental change; Feedback strength; Nutrient delivery; Nutrient recycling; Organic carbon burial; Silicate weathering; Terrestrial vegetation; Volcanic outgassing; Weathering; alkalinity; black shale; carbon cycle; chemical weathering; Devonian; efficiency measurement; numerical model; organic carbon; paleoenvironment; silicate; Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077898941

The seagrass Zostera marina is a common species in the temperate Northern Hemisphere, a region with strong seasonal variations in climate. How seasonality affects carbon storage capacity in seagrass meadows is largely unknown, and therefore, in this study, we aimed to assess variations in sedimentary total organic carbon (TOC) content over a 1-year cycle in seagrass meadows on the Swedish west coast. The TOC was measured in two Z. marina sites, one wave exposed and one sheltered, and at two depths (1.5 and 4 m) within each site, every second month from August 2015 to June 2016. We found a strong seasonal variation in carbon density, with a peak in early summer (June), and that the TOC was negatively correlated to the net community production of the meadows, presumably related to organic matter degradation. There was seasonal variation in TOC content at all sediment sections, indicating that the carbon content down to 30 cm is unstable on a seasonal scale and therefore likely not a long-term carbon sink. The yearly mean carbon stocks were substantially higher in the sheltered meadow (3,965 and 3,465 g m−2) compared to the exposed one (2,712 and 1,054 g m−2) with similar seasonal variation. Due to the large intra-annual variability in TOC content, seasonal variation should be considered in carbon stock assessments and management for cold-temperate seagrass meadows. ©2020.

This book takes the necessity of re-shaping the concept of building design in order to transform buildings from large scale energy consumers to energy savers and producers into consideration. The book is organized in two parts: theory and case studies. For the theoretical part, we chose from the wide range of sources that provide energy efficient materials and systems the two that seem to be endless: the sun and vegetation. Their use in building products represents a tool for specialists in the architectural design concept. The case-studies presented analyze different architectural programs, in different climates, from new buildings to rehabilitation approaches and from residential architecture to hospitals and sports arenas; each case emphasizes the interdisciplinarity of the building design activity in order to help readers gain a better understanding of the complex approach needed for energy efficient building design.

In this context, regions that are farther from refineries and lack the presence of fuel distribution centers tend to suffer more from the availability and cost of this resource. Economically speaking, agribusiness has a prominent position in the national scenery. The world fuel source had an evolution from the predominance of solid fuels to the current age of liquid fuels derived from petroleum and seeing the future and growing age of gas fuels as the predecessor stage of electric vehicles in some markets. Thereby, agricultural organic waste has the potential to generate an alternative energy, clean and ecological matrix, also reducing the emission of polluting gases, soil, groundwater, rivers and weir are still prevented, and the release of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, such as methane and carbon dioxide. In Brazil, animal waste is normally used for the generation of biofuel, and only 14% of it used in automobiles. Thus, biogas has been studied as a promising energy matrix because it is less polluting and renewable to mitigate the damaging effects of fossil fuels. However, it is highest limitation is the low development of adaptation for Diesel engines, whereupon the project in question is aimed, of which purpose is to develop solutions for existing Diesel engines while maintaining the performance and durability, reducing the dependence of fossil fuels and allowing the use of alternative and cheaper energy sources, produced by the agriculturalists who have space and infrastructure to produce their own fuel, making it self-sustaining. Thus, the development of the project will be guided by the injection of the biogas in the intake manifold in a stoichiometric ratio of air/fuel according to operational necessity, while the biodiesel injected directly into the combustion chamber will be of utmost importance for the start of combustion as pilot flame, since the biogas is unable to combust only with the compression of the cylinder. © 2019 SAE International.

Perceptions of particular types of extreme events, i.e. extreme heat and droughts, have attracted the most attention, whereas the possible effects of place (such as proximity to coastal areas vulnerable to sea-level rise) on public beliefs about the link between changes to weather patterns and global warming have been largely neglected. This study matches geo-located responses to a nationally representative survey of US residents with climate extremes data in order to investigate the social and physical factors shaping public views about the links between global warming and extreme weather. Specifically, regional-level Climate Extremes Indices (CEI) are modelled together with individual-level socio-demographic characteristics and an indicator of coastal residence to test whether the incidence of extreme events and proximity to the coasts, net of social and economic factors, correspond to increased perceptions that global warming has affected the weather. Results indicate that coastal shoreline county residence significantly predicts individuals’ beliefs about the extent to which global warming is affecting the weather. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Climate change; climate extremes; coastal communities; risk perceptions; survey research",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075159827

How the GCF’s limited funds could be used to leverage additional financial resources has therefore become a key challenge. This study investigates whether the experience of the Global Environment Facility (GEF), especially with co-financing, could offer useful lessons. It analyzes 4,574 projects implemented by the GEF and investigates how leverage has been used to acquire greater international environmental assistance. We find that the co-financing ratio of GEF grants increased from 3.95–7.69 during 1991–2018, and climate change projects show the strongest leverage potential. We also find that the GEF generates different co-financing effects on different receipts, being higher in emerging economies and lower in low-income countries. These lessons are applied to GCF fundraising to determine which of four different funding allocation mechanisms could achieve the maximum co-financing effect. If the GCF follows the GEF leverage ratio, then the co-financing achieved by the proposed Carbon Reduction Contribution Principle (CC) allocation mechanism is the highest, while that of the Adaptation Needs Principle (AN) is the lowest. Although emerging economies are generally richer than other developing countries, excluding emerging economies from the GCF is not a wise option as it not only inhibits co-financing, but also weakens the climate mitigation purpose of the GCF. Key policy insights Emerging economies are able to leverage more co-financing than lower income countries. The GCF should therefore reserve partial grants for emerging economies to enhance total co-financing. To balance the allocation of funds among recipients, the GCF should set different co-financing standards for different developing countries, with emerging economies required to secure more co-financing than lower income countries. Regional co-financing ratios of the GEF for climate change purposes can be used as a reference. Co-financing will make climate mitigation more attractive than climate adaptation. The GCF should therefore balance the three targets of co-financing, climate mitigation and climate adaptation together to achieve a more equitable and effective use of the fund. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate adaptation; climate mitigation; co-financing; global environment facility; Green climate fund","climate change; developing world; environmental economics; environmental policy; financial system; international organization; mitigation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075518468

The aim of this paper is to estimate future values of GHG emissions in Europe, considering different periods of reference and through two common mathematical parameters (average annual growth rate (AAGR) and compound annual growth rate (CAGR)). Results analysis show that a reduction of GHG emissions can be reached. However, some Member States (MSs) as Ireland and Netherlands present a critical situation. In addition, it is defined the linear correlation of GHG emissions with both Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and population. An increase of 1000 GDP Purchasing Power Standards (PPS) means an additional 0.325 tons CO2eq of GHG emissions and an increase of one citizen means an additional 9.6 tons CO2eq of GHG emissions. Finally, a comparison among European countries is defined for 2015 according to two indexes: I) GHG emissions intensity of the economy and ii) GHG emissions per capita. A new framework is proposed, in which the average of European Union (EU) 28 is used as reference level and the target value as benchmark. Regarding the first index, Sweden occupies the first position (160 gCO2eq per GDP PPS) followed by Malta and France with 223 and 233 gCO2eq per GDP PPS, respectively. Concerning the second index, Croatia has the best performance with 5646 kgCO2eq per capita followed by Sweden and Latvia with 5733 and 5866 kgCO2eq per capita, respectively.

Light and temperature are major factors in the vineyard that affect berry development and fruit metabolite composition. Results: To better understand the effect of ""place"" on transcript abundance during the late stages of berry ripening, Cabernet Sauvignon berries grown in Bordeaux and Reno were compared at similar sugar levels (19 to 26 °Brix (total soluble solids)). Day temperatures were warmer and night temperatures were cooler in Reno. °Brix was lower in Bordeaux berries compared to Reno at maturity levels considered optimum for harvest. RNA-Seq analysis identified 5528 differentially expressed genes between Bordeaux and Reno grape skins at 22°Brix. Weighted Gene Coexpression Network Analysis for all expressed transcripts for all four °Brix levels measured indicated that the majority (75%) of transcript expression differed significantly between the two locations. Top gene ontology categories for the common transcript sets were translation, photosynthesis, DNA metabolism and catabolism. Top gene ontology categories for the differentially expressed genes at 22°Brix involved response to stimulus, biosynthesis and response to stress. Some differentially expressed genes encoded terpene synthases, cell wall enzymes, kinases, transporters, transcription factors and photoreceptors. Most circadian clock genes had higher transcript abundance in Bordeaux. Bordeaux berries had higher transcript abundance with differentially expressed genes associated with seed dormancy, light, auxin, ethylene signaling, powdery mildew infection, phenylpropanoid, carotenoid and terpenoid metabolism, whereas Reno berries were enriched with differentially expressed genes involved in water deprivation, cold response, ABA signaling and iron homeostasis. Conclusions: Transcript abundance profiles in the berry skins at maturity were highly dynamic. RNA-Seq analysis identified a smaller (25% of total) common core set of ripening genes that appear not to depend on rootstock, vineyard management, plant age, soil and climatic conditions. Much of the gene expression differed between the two locations and could be associated with multiple differences in environmental conditions that may have affected the berries in the two locations; some of these genes may be potentially controlled in different ways by the vinegrower to adjust final berry composition and reach a desired result. © 2020 The Author(s).","Abiotic stress; Biotic stress; Grape berry development; RNA-Seq; Transcriptomics; Vitis vinifera L","transcription factor; transcriptome; agricultural land; environment; France; fruit; gene expression profiling; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; physiological stress; plant gene; United States; Vitis; wine; Environment; Farms; France; Fruit; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Stress, Physiological; Transcription Factors; Transcriptome; United States; Vitis; Wine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078657349

Our analyses show that even though the number of identified private sector providers considerably increased compared to previous mappings, the market is still dominated by public climate service providers. Based on the definition of climate services applied here, our data show an unequal distribution of climate service providers in the EU Member States with a significant gap between Eastern Member States and the rest of the European Union. In general, the supply side is dominated by downstream activities such as advisory services or publications compared to upstream services such data collection. For both public and private providers, the primarily targeted sectors are water, energy, agriculture and urban/spatial planning.

In order to curb the effects of climate change, economic industries including tourism must assess their contributions to the overall phenomenon and develop creative solutions. As carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions represent a major reason why global tourism is contributing to climate change, carbon footprinting can help identify which aspects of individual tourism events are least sustainable. This case study seeks to assess the total carbon footprint of four seasons of American college football. The fan journey to the college football spectate represents a tourism experience and therefore can and should be assessed for its ecological impact. The subject of this case study is the University of Tennessee, an institution with one of the largest football stadiums in the United States. Using an extensive geographic sample of ticketing data from Tennessee’s home games during the 2015–2018 seasons, a carbon footprint was estimated for each game, each contributing polluter, and each season. The total season footprint over the four years was estimated to be 154,717,114 kg CO2eq. This study presents both a methodology for studying spectator sporting events in sport tourism and a framework by which tourism can begin to assess its contributions to the global carbon footprint.

In the United States, B. indicus breeds are mostly used to generate B. indicus × B. taurus crosses with increased thermal and parasite tolerance, while retaining some productive characteristics of B. taurus cattle. Although crossbreeding represents a proven strategy to improve cattle adaptation almost immediately, research has also attempted to identify B. taurus genetics that can withstand subtropical and tropical climates. Reduced milk production and delayed reproductive maturation appear to be related with tropical adaptation of B. taurus breeds, as a means to conserve energy under stressful conditions and limited nutrition. Moreover, longevity may be the ultimate adaptation response to unfavorable environments, and retention of bulls and heifers from proven cows is the recommended strategy to improve longevity in B. indicus-influenced herds. Besides selection for longevity, other aspects should be considered when planning reproductive management in tropical and subtropical regions. Bos indicus and B. taurus breeds have multiple differences pertaining to reproductive function, including age at puberty, ovarian dynamics, and pregnancy development. Nutritional strategies such as the stair-step regimen, and use of exogenous progesterone (P4) inserts are options to hasten puberty attainment of late-maturing B. indicus-influenced heifers. Yet, limited pharmacological alternatives are available for reproductive management of B. indicus-influenced females in the United States, which rely on GnRH-based protocols not specifically designed to the reproductive function of B. indicus breeds. In contrast, hormonal protocols based on exogenous P4, estradiol esters, and equine chorionic gonadotropin are available for use in B. indicus females in South America. These include protocols tailored to prepubertal heifers, anestrous cows, and cycling nulliparous or parous females, which often yield pregnancy rates of 50% to fixed-time artificial insemination. The global dairy industry also faces similar challenges in increasing demand and production as the beef industry. Selection of cows capable of sustaining optimal milk yield, reproductive success, and health status in hot and humid conditions is essential for optimal dairy production in subtropical and tropical regions. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Bos indicus-influenced cattle predominate in these regions but are often managed using practices developed for Bos taurus breeds reared in temperate climates. Hence, a fundamental step to meet the increasing global demand for beef is to develop specific management for B. indicus-influenced cattle in tropical or subtropical environments. Bos taurus and B. indicus are different subspecies, and diverge in social and biological functions due to selection pressure caused by complex evolutionary and domestication processes. Bos indicus cattle display different social responses compared with B. taurus counterparts, which must be taken into account by management planning as these traits directly impact cattle performance and welfare. In tropical and subtropical regions, warm-season perennial C4 grasses are the dominant forages, and their availability has a significant influence on the productivity of beef cattle systems. The resilience of C4 grasses under adverse conditions is one of their most important characteristics, even though these forages have reduced nutritive value compared with forages from temperate climates. Accordingly, nutritional planning in tropical and subtropical conditions must include management to optimize the quantity and quality of C4 forages. Nutritional requirements of cattle raised within these conditions also require special attention, including inherent metabolic compromises to cope with environmental constraints and altered energy requirements due to body composition and heat tolerance. Nutritional interventions to enhance beef production need to be specifically tailored and validated in B. indicus-influenced cattle. As an example, supplementation programs during gestation or early life to elicit fetal programming or metabolic imprinting effects, respectively, yield discrepant outcomes between subspecies. Bos indicus-influenced cattle produce carcasses with less marbling than B. taurus cattle, despite recent genetic and management advances. This outcome is mostly related to reduced intramuscular adipocyte volume in B. indicus breeds, suggesting a lesser need for energy stored intramuscularly as a mechanism to improve thermotolerance in tropical and subtropical climates. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

Pacific sardine (Sardinops sagax) in the California Current is shared by up to three fishing nations— Canada, the United States, and Mexico—and climate-driven abundance and distribution dynamics can complicate cooperative fisheries, leading to overfishing. This study builds on previous analyses by integrating ecosystem linkages into a game theory model of transboundary sardine fisheries under various climate scenarios. Cooperative fishing strategies that account for the ecosystem-wide value of sardine as forage for other species result in increased economic benefits compared to strategies that only account for the single-species value of sardine fisheries to a given fishing country. Total ecosystem landed value is maximized at a sardine fishing rate only somewhat lower than sardine FMSY, which is more precautionary but still allows the fishery to operate. Incorporating ecosystem dynamics into management-applicable models can highlight ways in which ecosystem-based fisheries management can improve both sustainability and profitability and help managers prioritize wider ecological research. Ecosystem-based management will be increasingly required to understand and adapt to the observed rapid shifts in species distributions due to climate change, and to design strategies to achieve sustainable and profitable fisheries amidst changing ecosystems. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem-based management; Game theory; Shifting species distributions; Transboundary stocks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073069974

Carbon-supported Cu nanoparticles are suitable candidates for integration in the state-of-the-art reaction interfaces, and here, we propose, synthesize, and evaluate a bifunctional Ni-N-doped-C-supported Cu electrocatalyst, in which the support possesses active sites for selective CO2 conversion to CO and Cu nanoparticles catalyze either the direct CO2 or CO reduction to hydrocarbons. In this work, we introduce the scientific rationale behind the concept, its applicability, and the challenges with regard to the catalyst. From the practical aspect, the deposition of Cu nanoparticles onto carbon black and Ni-N-C supports via an ammonia-driven deposition precipitation method is reported and explored in more detail using X-ray diffraction, thermogravimetric analysis, and hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction. High-angle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF-STEM) and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) give further evidence of the presence of Cu-containing nanoparticles on the Ni-N-C supports while revealing an additional relationship between the nanoparticle's composition and the electrode's electrocatalytic performance. Compared to the benchmark carbon black-supported Cu catalysts, Ni-N-C-supported Cu delivers up to a 2-fold increase in the partial C2H4 current density at -1.05 VRHE (C1/C2 = 0.67) and a concomitant 10-fold increase of the CO partial current density.

At EB1, sulfate reduction (SR) and iron reduction (FeR) dominated organic carbon (Corg) oxidation, accounting for 65 and 25% of anaerobic Corg oxidation, respectively. In contrast, manganese reduction (MnR) was responsible for >50% of anaerobic Corg mineralization at manganese oxide-rich EB6. Members of Desulfobacteraceae, known as putative sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB), constituted a major Corg-oxidizing clade (22% of Bacteria) at EB1. Meanwhile, putatively Mn-reducing bacteria affiliated with Colwelliaceae, Shewanellaceae and Oceanospirillaceae were abundant in EB6 (8% of Bacteria). RNA-stable isotope probing (RNASIP) further identified Arcobacter as acetate-oxidizers associated with FeR, while no SRB were labeled at EB1.

Interestingly, at both sites, Thaumarchaeota were labeled with 13C derived from acetate during the anoxic incubations. The results from RNA-SIP give new insights into the biogeochemical and ecological role of Arcobacter in FeR, and the metabolic activity of Thaumarchaeota under anoxia.

Although N2O-related neurological sequelae such as spinal cord degeneration and sensorimotor peripheral neuropathy are well known, psychiatric manifestations of heavy N2O use remain unclear. Here, we presented 7 treatment-seeking patients with severe N2O use disorder to delineate the psychiatric profiles of N2O users in Asia. METHODS: Seven patients with severe N2O use disorder who sought treatment in Taipei City Psychiatric Center between 2017 and 2018 were enrolled. We used chart review method to retrospectively collect their clinical information including sociodemographics, psychiatric and substance history, urine toxicology findings, and treatment course. RESULTS: These N2O users all had diagnoses of severe N2O use disorder. They usually initiated N2O use in late adolescence and early adulthood. Six of them had histories of mood disorders; all of them reported other illicit substance use before using N2O. The main reasons for treatment seeking were irritability, psychotic symptoms, self-harm, or violent behaviors as four of them were given a diagnosis of substance-induced psychotic disorder. Urine drug screen showed negative for other illicit drug use except for 1 positive case for cannabis and 1 for amphetamine. Three of 7 cases were hospitalized because of the severity of their psychiatric symptoms and suicidal risk. CONCLUSIONS: These cases with severe N2O use disorder showed high prevalence of psychotic symptoms and dangerous behaviors such as suicide or violence. This study highlights the addiction potential of N2O and its related adverse consequences in the psychiatric aspect.",,"inhalation anesthetic agent; nitrous oxide; adult; comorbidity; complication; drug dependence; female; human; male; psychology; psychosis; retrospective study; risk factor; severity of illness index; suicidal ideation; Taiwan; violence; young adult; Adult; Anesthetics, Inhalation; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Male; Nitrous Oxide; Psychotic Disorders; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Severity of Illness Index; Substance-Related Disorders; Suicidal Ideation; Taiwan; Violence; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077016845

Understanding the behavior of pollutant emissions from HDDTs facilitate the formulation of traffic-related policy measures to mitigate the adverse effects. This study proposes a new method to estimate the emission inventory of HDDTs and analyze their spatiotemporal evolution characteristics. Multi-source data were fused to provide a complete picture of the transport environment. With the idea of modeling pollutant emissions by “single vehicle” and “road segment,” emission inventories were constructed with different spatiotemporal scales using localized emission factors. A spatiotemporal cube model was introduced to represent the high-resolution emission inventory. A hot-spot and local-outlier analysis were conducted to explore the spatiotemporal evolution mechanism of pollutant emissions. The megacity of Tianjin in China was taken as the area for the case study. The average daily emissions of CO, NOx, PM, and VOC are 12,978.18, 48,675.22, 712.6, and 1217.72 kg d−1, respectively. Temporally, the pollutant emission had a significant peak at 06:00, 11:00, and 18:00 and was affected by major festivals. Spatially, the distribution pattern of emission was policy-driven and closely related to its spatial location. It increases radially outward from the outer-ring road to the periphery. The hot-spot analysis identified 16 pollutant emission patterns. The road segment with persistent cold spots accounted for 48.27% of the roads, mainly distributed within the outer ring road. The road segments with intensifying and persistent hot spots accounted for 19.04% of roads, mainly distributed on the intercity highway. The locations with outlier values reached 12,027, accounting for 31.90%. The key time intervals of the occurrence of the outlier pattern are 11:00–12:00 and 01:00–02:00. Road segments showing only the low–low cluster pattern is mainly located within the outer ring roads. Those with only low–high outlier pattern exhibits a relatively scattered spatial distribution, which is affected by the heterogeneous distribution of HDDTs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Heavy-duty diesel trucks; Spatiotemporal cube; Spatiotemporal evolution pattern; Trajectory mining; Transport emission","Automobiles; Diesel engines; Health risks; Mine trucks; Pollution; Roads and streets; Statistics; Heavy-duty diesel; Spatiotemporal cube; Spatiotemporal evolution; Trajectory minings; Transport emissions; Pattern recognition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073033175

This enhancement has been suggested to increase the direct radiative forcing of nitrate, called the ""massenhancement effect"". Through a size-resolved dynamic mass transfer modeling approach, we show that interactions with sea salt shift the nitrate from sub-to super-micron-sized particles (""redistribution effect""), and hence this lowers its efficiency for light extinction and reduces its lifetime. The redistribution effect overwhelms the mass-enhancement effect and significantly moderates nitrate cooling; e.g., the nitrateassociated aerosol optical depth can be reduced by 10 %-20% over European polluted regions during a typical seasalt event, in contrast to an increase by ∼ 10% when only accounting for the mass-enhancement effect. Global model simulations indicate significant redistribution over coastal and offshore regions worldwide. Our study suggests a strong buffering by natural sea-salt aerosols that reduces the climate forcing of anthropogenic nitrate, which had been expected to dominate the aerosol cooling by the end of the century. Comprehensive considerations of this redistribution effect foster better understandings of climate change and nitrogen deposition. © Author(s) 2020.",,"aerosol; aerosol composition; anthropogenic source; climate forcing; nitrate; optical depth; particulate matter; sea salt; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078434036

Some strategies for reducing PM2:5 may have the notable side effect of increasing O3. Here, we demonstrate a numerical framework for investigating the impacts of mitigation strategies on both PM2:5 and O3 in Delhi. We use Gaussian process emulation to generate a computationally efficient surrogate for a regional air quality model (WRFChem). This allows us to perform global sensitivity analysis to identify the major sources of air pollution and to generate emission-sector-based pollutant response surfaces to inform mitigation policy development. Based on more than 100 000 emulation runs during the pre-monsoon period (peak O3 season), our global sensitivity analysis shows that local traffic emissions from the Delhi city region and regional transport of pollution emitted from the National Capital Region (NCR) surrounding Delhi are dominant factors influencing PM2:5 and O3 in Delhi. They together govern the O3 peak and PM2:5 concentration during daytime. Regional transport contributes about 80% of the PM2:5 variation during the night. Reducing traffic emissions in Delhi alone (e.g. by 50 %) would reduce PM2:5 by 15 %-20% but lead to a 20 %-25% increase in O3. However, we show that reducing NCR regional emissions by 25 %-30% at the same time would further reduce PM2:5 by 5 %-10% in Delhi and avoid the O3 increase. This study provides scientific evidence to support the need for joint coordination of controls on local and regional scales to achieve effective reduction in PM2:5 whilst minimising the risk of O3 increase in Delhi. © Author(s) 2020.",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; Gaussian method; megacity; monsoon; numerical model; ozone; particulate matter; policy development; sensitivity analysis; traffic emission; Delhi; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078242622

The pH-dependent kinetics for CH4 and C2H4 generation were used to represent the intrinsic catalytic characteristics for the agglomerate catalyst. The modeling indicated that relative to planar electrodes for either CO reduction (COR) or CO2 reduction (CO2R), substantial increases in electrochemical reduction rates and Faradaic efficiencies are expected when flow-through GDEs are used. The spatially resolved pH and reaction rates within the flow-through GDEs were also simulated for two different operating pHs, and the resulting transport losses were analyzed quantitatively.

Yet debates over China’s hydro behaviour towards shared water resources do not stop at its borders. Within China, virtually all large dams built, launched, or proposed, including those on the Lancang/Mekong River, also suffer from “popularity deficiencies”. There is increasing scepticism in Chinese public attitudes towards narrowly equating water resources to hydropower, banking exclusively on energy policies to address climate change, prompting economic growth with mega-dam projects, and/or assuming inevitable correlations between hydro development and poverty reduction. This chapter examines the major positions in China’s internal hydro politics and controversies. Navigating through China’s domestically identified and publicly debated pros and cons of its involvement with the Mekong River, the chapter concludes that the prospect of Beijing changing its course of action for hydro development is not great. Accordingly, the Chinese government and opinion leaders may still have a long way to go before they can effectively reframe the prevalent “China hydro-hegemonic/Mekong-choking/Subregion-encroachment threat” accounts into a “China opportunity” narrative. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Charles Samuel Johnston and Xin Chen.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096279915

However, it remains unclear how land-use legacy effects shape soil nitrogen (N) transformation processes and microbial contribution to N2O production after long-term ecosystem recovery. To address this question, we measured soil N transformation processes and quantified the contribution of soil microbes to N2O production in three tropical forests with different land-use histories (primary, rehabilitated and disturbed forests) in South China. Results showed that soil N2O production was positively correlated with the abundances of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA amoA) and nirS- and nirK-denitrifiers in the three forests, suggesting that these microbial groups can contribute greatly to N2O production in tropical forests, regardless of land-use legacy effects.

In order to integrate high share of renewable energy, more flexibility is needed in the power system. Among all the flexibility options, taking customer-sited energy storage systems as demand response could be a promising measure addressing both grid needs and customer needs. In order to analyse the effect of customer-sited energy storage systems on renewable energy integration, an integrated power generation and customer-sited energy storage systems expansion planning model is proposed in this paper. The expansion and operation of energy storage systems are based on the objective of reducing total power generation costs. Sichuan province in China is taken as a case study due to its abundant renewable energy resources and increasing renewable energy share in the power system. The results indicate that: 1) demand response provided by customer-sited energy storage could partially replace coal power plants to provide flexibility for integrating high share of renewable energy into power system; 2) The utilization scale of renewable energy could be increased and CO2 emissions could be reduced significantly. In order to encourage the deployment of customer-sited energy storage systems, more policy support for energy storage technology and electricity market mechanism improvement are needed to enhance the development of customer-sited energy storage systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Customer-sited energy storage; Modelling and optimization; Power generation expansion planning; Renewable energy integration",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092766094

The possible existence of an EKC has in the past been tested using relatively short time series of data and presumed indicators of environmental quality that can be considered sub-optimal. This paper addresses these shortcomings in investigating the extent to which economic growth and environmental quality in Singapore, the most economically developed country in Southeast Asia (SEA), accord with an EKC. A heavy metal (chromium, Cr) is here used as an indicator of environmental quality. This is because levels of a heavy metal with well-known risks to health are likely to have a much stronger relationship with perceptions of local environmental quality than, for example, CO2 emissions, and therefore likely to elicit a more rapid response from legislators. A national emission inventory (NEI) analysis quantified atmospheric Cr emissions from 1900 to 2017. Levels of Cr emissions increased rapidly during the 1960s–1980s, a period characterized by industrialization in Singapore that commenced around the time of its independence, returning to negligible levels by the 1990s as the country entered the current period of de-industrialization and economic modernization. Results of the NEI for the period post-1950, when an unbroken time series of reliable and annually comparable economic data first become available, were further subjected to econometric analysis, which confirmed the EKC hypothesis with regard to Cr emissions in Singapore. Results also suggest that the post-industrial development of Singapore may have contributed to creating pollution havens in the region. Together the findings have important implications for regional sustainable development and the governance of pollution emissions, including those that potentially have transboundary effects, more generally. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Heavy metal; Industrialization; National emission inventory; Pollution haven; Southeast Asia; Sustainable development","Chromium; Economic analysis; Health risks; Heavy metals; Planning; Pollution; Risk perception; Sustainable development; Time series; Time series analysis; Environmental kuznets curve hypothesis; Environmental Kuznets curves; Industrial development; Industrialization; National emission inventories; Regional sustainability; Regional sustainable development; Southeast Asia; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073005547

Therefore, we evaluated the effect of air pollutants on the short-term outcomes of emergency department patients with pneumonia. We collected data on PM2.5 (aerodynamic diameter &lt; 2.5 µm), PM10 (aerodynamic diameter &lt; 10 µm), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and ozone from 11 air-quality monitoring stations in Kaohsiung City between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2013. Medical records were extracted for non-trauma patients aged &gt; 17 years who had visited the emergency department with a principal diagnosis of pneumonia. In-hospital mortality and the association of air pollutant exposure with the need for invasive respiratory and/or vasopressor support (IRVS) within 72 h were evaluated. Interquartile range (IQR) increments of PM2.5 and PM10 were associated with an increased IRVS risk with odds ratios (ORs) of 1.211 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.031–1.419) and 1.194 (95% CI, 1.020–1.394) on lag 1, respectively, and per-IQR increments of NO2 were associated with an increased IRVS risk with an OR of 1.146 (95% CI, 1.004–1.308) on lag 2. IQR increments of PM2.5 and NO2 were associated with an increased in-hospital mortality risk with ORs of 1.202 (95% CI, 1.100–1.429) and 1.175 (95% CI, 1.014–1.360), respectively. During the warm season, IQR increments of PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 corresponded with an increased IRVS risk, with ORs of 1.333 (95% CI, 1.078–1.644), 1.348 (95% CI, 1.090–1.665), and 1.321 (95% CI, 1.101– 1.585), respectively. For patients with pneumonia, PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 exposures were risk factors for a poor prognosis. Exposure effects appeared to be greater during the warm season.

This study proposes an optimization model for planning the energy-water-environment nexus system (EWENS) through incorporating the linear autoregressive integrated moving average model prediction model (ARIMA), Monte Carlo simulation, chance-constrained programming (CCP), and type-2 fuzzy programming (T2FP) into one general framework. This method effectively tackles type-2 fuzzy set and stochastic uncertainties. The proposed model can quantitatively explore the interconnections between water, energy, and environment systems and generate an optimized solution for EWENS. The proposed model was applied to a coal-dominated region of China, i.e., Inner Mongolia. Several findings and policy implications were obtained. First, the total water supply for energy-generating activities will range from 1368.10 × 106 m3 to 1370.62 × 106 m3, at the end of planning periods. Second, the electricity for water supply will range from 2164.07 × 106 kWh to 2167.65 × 106 kWh at the end of the planning periods, with a growth rate of 46.06-48.72%. Thirdly, lifecycle carbon dioxide emission (LCDE) is projected to range from 931.85 × 106 tons to 947.00 × 106 tons at the end of the planning periods. Wastewater and SO2, NOx, and particulate matter (PM) emissions are projected to be 42.72 × 10-43.45 × 10 tons, 183.07 × 103-186.23 × 103 tons, 712.38 × 103-724.73 × 103 tons, and 38.14 × 103-38.80 × 103 tons at the end of the planning periods. Fourthly, as the largest electricity-exporting city of China, Inner Mongolia's electricity outflows will export 1435.78 × 106 m3 of virtual water to other regions, implying that Inner Mongolia is pumping its important water resource to support other regions' electricity demands. Finally, high carbon mitigation levels can effectively optimize the electricity power mix, reduce consumption amounts of water and coal, and mitigate air pollutants, wastewater, and LCDE. The obtained results provide useful information for managers to develop a sustainability plan for the EWENS. © 2020 MDPI AG.

This material exhibited a remarkable methane uptake per unit surface area, which outperformed those of most reported porous organic materials. Variable-temperature thermodynamic adsorption measurements corroborated the significantly less negative entropy penalty during high-pressure gas adsorption, compared to its non-ladder-type counterpart.

However, the representation of solar plants in these models is highly simplistic and does not account for dynamical effects, which may pose risks under the simulations for tracking photovoltaics (PV). To make a more comprehensive assessment of the PV-induced climatic impacts, it is relevant to further develop a more sophisticated PV module based on the observed PV-induced impacts from specific cases. To remedy the deficiencies in the existing PV energy models, the newly sophisticated PV module established in this paper includes both the land surface radiation balance, sensible heat balance and the surface physical dray process over the locations of PV plants. It is then used to simulate the local climatic impacts of PV plants through three parallel sensitivity experiments. Comparison analysis between control run and two PV installation scenarios showed obvious changes in the 10-m wind speed, land surface temperature, and 2-m specific humidity were found locally over the locations of PV plants during both the warm and cold periods.

Climate change adaptation interventions can be better targeted by being linked with type of climatic risks experienced by women farmers, their social profile and their needs based on the role they play in agriculture. This study presents a methodology to identify hotspots where climate change adaptation and gender based interventions could be prioritized. The methodology is illustrated for India. The results suggest 36 hotspots across 10 states in India, where large number of women farmers are impacted by high levels of drought probability, excess rainfall and heat wave. The target population in these hotspots comprise 14.4% of the total women farmers in the country. A socioeconomic characterization of the hotspot population highlights barriers, such as labor, credit and market access for female cultivators and lower wage rates for female laborers in these hotspots. Based on the constraints as well as the climatic risks faced by these women in the hotspots, the potential of climate-smart agriculture technologies and practices are emphasized. Additionally, a comparison of current research being done in the field with the results of the study highlights the potential to learn from current efforts for efficient scalability of gender and climate change adaptation interventions. © 2018, The Author(s).","Climate change adaptation; Climate-smart agriculture; Female in agriculture; Hotspots","Agricultural implements; Agriculture; Employment; Climate change adaptation; Climatic risks; Heat waves; Hotspots; Market access; Research and development; Smart agricultures; Social profiles; Climate change; adaptive management; agricultural management; agrometeorology; climate change; climate effect; drought stress; female headed household; heat wave; precipitation intensity; risk assessment; womens status; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85051521215

Buildings account for over 30% of total energy consumption in China which is one of the world’s fastest-growing economies over the globe. China has experienced fast-paced economic growth and has been in a stage of rapid urban development for the last decade; however, challenges from natural resources and sustainable development have accompanied its economic development. In recent years, increasing public concerns on the negative impacts of the construction industry on energy use and climate change has made energy efficiency in buildings becomes a fertile area of research.

In this mainly rural region, no study has been carried out to identify and interpret regional ozone episodes, so this work aims to fill this gap. Ozone and precursor (nitrogen oxides and organic compounds) levels from six representative air quality monitoring stations located in suburban and rural areas have been used to investigate selected ozone episodes during 2014 and 2015. Air mass back-trajectories were used to assess the contribution of long-range transport, resulting in Europe, Mediterranean and Peninsular routes. The analysis of synoptic patterns revealed that high pressures with stationary character, which occur in different synoptic conditions, have an important role in the increment of the ozone values. Finally, the evaluation of the results showed that the daily ozone cycle is mainly regulated by the emissions of precursors in the surrounding environment, the high temperatures that occur during the day and the influence of atmospheric conditions on the low troposphere under anticyclonic conditions that promote ozone accumulation. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Ozone episodes; Synoptic patterns; Tropospheric ozone; Tropospheric ozone cycle","air quality; environmental conditions; ozone; rural area; suburban area; synoptic meteorology; troposphere; Extremadura; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076564064

I then present a case study of water-use efficiency in northern Australian tree species. In general, C3 plants face a trade-off whereby increasing stomatal conductance for a given set of conditions will result in a higher CO2 assimilation rate, but a lower photosynthetic water-use efficiency. A common garden experiment suggested that tree species which are able to establish and grow in drier parts of northern Australia have a capacity to use water rapidly when it is available through high stomatal conductance, but that they do so at the expense of low water-use efficiency. This may explain why community-level carbon isotope discrimination does not decrease as steeply with decreasing rainfall on the North Australian Tropical Transect as has been observed on some other precipitation gradients. Next, I discuss changes in water-use efficiency that take place during leaf expansion in C3 plant leaves. Leaf phenology has recently been recognised as a significant driver of canopy gas exchange in evergreen forest canopies, and leaf expansion involves changes in both photosynthetic capacity and water-use efficiency. Following this, I discuss the role of woody tissue respiration in canopy gas exchange and how photosynthetic refixation of respired CO2 can increase whole-plant water-use efficiency. Finally, I discuss the role of water-use efficiency in driving terrestrial plant responses to global change, especially the rising concentration of atmospheric CO2. In coming decades, increases in plant water-use efficiency caused by rising CO2 are likely to partially mitigate impacts on plants of drought stress caused by global warming. © 2018 German Society for Plant Sciences and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands","Photosynthesis; stable carbon isotopes; stomatal conductance; water-use efficiency","carbon isotope; drought stress; evergreen forest; gas exchange; precipitation intensity; stomatal conductance; trade-off; water use efficiency; Australia; carbon dioxide; water; Australia; metabolism; photosynthesis; plant leaf; Australia; Carbon Dioxide; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Water",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85058863794

Since 2016 the requirement for all new buildings to achieve energy-efficiency class ""A"" came into force in Lithuania. One of the requirements to meet this class are detailed calculations of the thermal transmittance values of the longitudinal thermal bridges. The same requirement is also requested for higher energy-efficiency buildings that are qualified as ""A+"" (obligatory since 2018) and ""A++"" (obligatory from 2021 onwards) class buildings. The purpose of this study is the numerical investigation of the impact of thermal bridges on energy efficient buildings under humid continental climate conditions. For the purpose of the study, the energy performance of the thermal bridges of a class A building, situated in Lithuania, were analyzed, using the tool Therm of LBNL a two-dimensional conduction heat-transfer analysis, based on the finite-element method. The calculations of the thermal transmittance values of the longitudinal thermal bridges were implemented in accordance with the requirements of EN ISO 10211:2008 standard. Alternative construction designs, with the aim to minimize the thermal losses of the building shell are also presented and discussed in this study. This study showed that detailed calculation of the losses through thermal bridges may have a significant importance to avoid dew points and mold in sensitive parts of the building shell, but they have a minor influence for the energy certification criteria.

More so, coastal governance encompasses not only the actions of the state (which includes local governments), but also of other actors such as communities, businesses and civil society organizations. Solutions to improving coastal governance include the implementation of Integrated Coastal Management which also serves as means to plan and achieve climate change adaptation. This paper proposes the establishment of a framework and methodology to assess local coastal governance based on a composite of hierarchical metrics formed by different forms of capital and associated factors and indicators. The application of this methodology resulted in the description of a baseline for local coastal governance. This baseline is useful for informing different functional levels within local government, e.g. technical, managerial and political. The baseline consisted of a comprehensive assessment of the different forms of capitals furthered categorized by factors and measured by indicators of local coastal governance. The capitals approach and method for measuring governance is potentially repeatable and can identify progress towards longer-term coastal management and climate adaptation goals as well as areas requiring improvements. Ultimately, it can be developed into a self-assessment tool to help local government to think reflexively about how they are managing the coast and the climate risks impacting on coastal assets and people. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Capital assessment framework; Climate change adaptation; Integrated coastal management; Local coastal governance; South Africa; Western Indian Ocean","Coastal engineering; Earth (planet); Risk assessment; Capital assessment; Climate change adaptation; Coastal governances; Integrated coastal management; South Africa; Western indian oceans; Climate change; adaptive management; capital; climate change; coastal zone management; environmental assessment; environmental change; environmental indicator; governance approach; implementation process; integrated approach; local government; social organization; Indian Ocean; Indian Ocean (West); South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072773683

Cocoa polyphenols have been proved to ameliorate important hallmarks of type-2 diabetes (T2D). They can regulate glucose levels by increasing insulin secretion, promoting β-cell proliferation and a reduction of insulin resistance. In addition, epidemiological evidence indicates that consumption of flavonoid decreases the incidence of T2D. Aim of the study: T2D is preceded by a prediabetic state in which the endocrine-metabolic changes described in T2D are already present. Since epidemiological evidence indicates that consumption of flavonoid decreases its incidence, we evaluated possible preventive effects of polyphenol-enriched cocoa extract on a model of prediabetes induced by sucrose. Materials and methods: We determined circulating parameters and insulin sensitivity indexes, liver protein carbonyl groups and reduced glutathione, liver mRNA expression levels of lipogenic enzymes, expression of different pro-inflammatory mediators, fructokinase activity and liver glycogen content. For that, radioimmunoassay, real-time polymerase chain reaction, Western blot, spectrophotometry, and immunohistochemistry were used. Results: We demonstrated that sucrose administration triggered hypertriglyceridemia, insulin-resistance, and liver increased oxidative stress and inflammation markers compared to control rats. Additionally, we found an increase in glycogen deposit, fructokinase activity, and lipogenic genes expression (SREBP-1c, FAS and GPAT) together with a decrease in P-Akt and P-eNOS protein content (P < 0.05). Sucrose-induced insulin resistance, hepatic carbohydrate and lipid dysmetabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation were effectively disrupted by polyphenol-enriched cocoa extract (PECE) co-administration (P < 0.05). Conclusion: Dietary administration of cocoa flavanols may be an effective and complementary tool for preventing or reverting T2D at an early stage of its development (prediabetes). © 2019","Inflammation; Insulin-resistance; Liver dysmetabolism; Polyphenol-enriched cocoa extract; Prediabetes; Sucrose rich diet","antidiabetic agent; cocoa extract; endothelial nitric oxide synthase; Fas ligand; fructokinase; glucose; glutathione; glycogen; gpat protein; inducible nitric oxide synthase; insulin; interleukin 6; liver protein; plant extract; polyphenol; protein kinase B; sterol regulatory element binding protein 1c; sucrose; triacylglycerol; tumor necrosis factor; unclassified drug; plant extract; polyphenol; triacylglycerol; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; antidiabetic activity; Article; cacao; controlled study; enzyme activity; glycogen analysis; glycogen liver level; high-sucrose diet; homeostasis model assessment; hypertriglyceridemia; immunohistochemistry; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin resistance; insulin sensitivity; male; mRNA expression level; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein content; protein phosphorylation; radioimmunoassay; rat; real time polymerase chain reaction; spectrophotometry; adverse event; animal; blood; cacao; chemistry; disease model; drug effect; human; impaired glucose tolerance; insulin resistance; isolation and purification; liver; metabolism; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; sugar intake; Animals; Cacao; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Dietary Sucrose; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Insulin Resistance; Liver; Male; Oxidative Stress; Plant Extracts; Polyphenols; Prediabetic State; Rats; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072774086

In recent years, countries that used to have traditional healthy diets (e.g., Mexico, China, and India), now present some of the highest rates of diabetes, obesity, and overweight. The rise of non-communicable diseases (NCD) has been linked to the global consumption of highly processed foods, refined sugars, fats, and flours, typical to the Western diet. Additionally, the environmental footprint of the latter is high, as it requires large agricultural areas, great quantities of pesticides, and produces large amounts of greenhouse gases. Here, we show that by diversifying our current eating habits through the consumption of products that once were part of traditional diets, we could lower the prevalence of NCD, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote crop diversification, reduce extinction risk of species due to human activities, and at the same time, reincorporate traditions into socioeconomic processes. To this end, we reviewed World Health Organization (WHO), Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), and World Bank databases and assessed information on health, agricultural, and environmental variables for the countries with the highest incidence of NCD, over the last 40 years. Furthermore, we focused on Mexico because it is home to the pre-Hispanic Mesoamerican world, but currently displays the highest mortality rates due to diabetes, obesity, and overweight. This country also presents an important rate of land-use change, among other negative environmental issues resulting from the adoption of the Western diet.

Box 419, Granada, 18080, Spain","In a 3-year microcosm study the nitrous oxide (N2O) emission from an agricultural soil amended with urea, ammonium sulphate or potassium nitrate were examined. Soil samples were taken every year to determine the soil physicochemical properties, the total abundance of bacteria, archaea, nitrifier and denitrifier communities and the changes in the structure and composition of the bacterial community. Gene abundance and biodiversity were estimated using quantitative PCR and pyrosequencing, respectively. The soils were watered weekly to reach 80% water filled pore space and varied from 80 to 62% during that time. N-fertilisation increased the abundance of bacteria and decreased that of archaea. Soils treated with ammonium or urea emitted more N2O than that amended with potassium nitrate and produced yearly increases in the abundance of nitrification genes. Also, the abundance of the denitrification genes gradually increased during the experimental period. N2O emission decreased on a yearly basis and so did the ratio of the genes involved in N2O production and reduction. A non-metric multidimensional scaling plot showed that N2O emission was positively related with the norB gene and negatively with the nosZ. The Shannon and Simpson diversity indices indicated that N-fertilisation reduced the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and that the bacterial community became dominated by a small group of OTUs, respectively. N-fertilisation reduced the number of OTUs whose relative abundance was lower than 1%. We conclude that potassium nitrate reduces N2O emissions and increases the abundance of the N2O reducers. This work also shows that N-fertilisation decreases soil biodiversity and that its response depends on the type of the N-fertiliser. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bacterial diversity; Denitrification; N-fertilisation; Nitrous oxide; Pyrosequencing; qPCR",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073827286

For this reason, adaptation and mitigation measures are important for the future of the wine industry. However, the process of adopting these measures by companies is not sufficiently known. The objective of this paper is to study the action against climate change by the wine sector in Spain, which has 13% of the world's vineyard area. Data capture was carried out through a survey of wineries. First, a questionnaire was designed and validated. This process included semi-structured and in-depth interviews with several winery owners. Second, the survey was conducted on a simple random sample of 87 Spanish wineries, stratified by region. Third, using a multivariate technique of factor analysis, the research found a set of 11 indicators describing the different types of measures adopted. In addition, a cluster analysis provided four different winery profiles. The first group comprises 37% of the wineries, whose sustainability actions are very focused on viticulture. The second group includes 22% of the wineries, which manage their activities according to widespread sustainability criteria. The third group is composed of 21% of the wineries, whose mitigation measures are only focused on energy. The fourth group includes 21% of the wineries, which are characterized by the absence of measures to achieve sustainability. Finally, the characteristics of the wineries and their responses to specific variables were studied, in relation to their belonging to the groups. The results show that the wineries of all the groups are aware of the existence of climate change and that it can seriously affect them. However, the adoption of measures is very variable from one group to another. Regarding the characteristics of the wineries, large companies and young professionals are positively related to the professional management of sustainability. The certification of organic production is frequent in the wineries, but it is not enough to guide them in their action against climate change. The calculation of the carbon footprint, which is not widespread, is associated with the wineries that systematically manage sustainability. In view of the results, some policies are suggested to favour the action of the vitivinicultural sector against climate change. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Cluster analysis; Mitigation; Survey; Viticulture; Winery","Carbon footprint; Cluster analysis; Surveying; Surveys; Sustainable development; Wine; Adaptation; Environmental conditions; Mitigation; Multivariate techniques; Professional management; Sustainability criteria; Viticulture; Winery; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073833842

To inform conservation actions supporting climate adaptations, we examined the colonization of Año Nuevo Island, a nearshore island in central California, by Cassin's Auklets (Ptychoramphus aleuticus). We quantified population growth, reproduction, band returns, mortality, and habitat metrics from 1995-2017 and described habitat management that facilitated colony persistence. Cassin's Auklet breeding population grew to 136 birds by 2014, despite population declines during 2005-2007 and 2016-2017 concurrent with reproductive failures and die-offs that affected Cassin's Auklets regionally. Annual productivity of this small colony was similar to larger populations in the region at 0.72 ± 0.23 SD chicks fledged per pair from 1999-2017 (n = 15 years). Band returns indicated population connectivity with the Farallon Islands, California. Annual rates of burrow damage were 14 ± 8%, with up to 30% damaged a year. Habitat management to prevent erosion damage to nesting burrows included sea lion exclusion, erosion control, and ceramic artificial burrows. Describing conditions that facilitated the colonization and growth of this Cassin's Auklet breeding site can inform actions that support other locations and multiple burrowing seabird species. © 2020 The Waterbird Society.

Potential effects of climate dynamics on urban areas may include the aggravation of current conditions, with identification of new hazards or risk drivers. These challenges require an integrated and forward-looking approach to sustainable urban development. Several tools and frameworks for assessing resilience have already been developed in different fields of study. However, aiming to focus on climate change, urban services and infrastructure, some specific needs were identified. In this light, a resilience assessment framework was developed to direct and facilitate an objective-driven resilience diagnosis of urban cities and services; to support decisions on selection of resilience measures and development of strategies to enhance resilience to climate change; to outline a path to co-build resilience action plans; and to track the progress of resilience in the city or in the service over time. The paper presents an outline of the structure of the framework and details the approach used in its development, including engagement tools and actions undertaken to assure stakeholder involvement in its development, validation and testing. © 2021 The Authors.","Assessment framework; Climate change; Development approach; Performance metrics; Urban resilience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089993866

Estimates indicate that on average these facilities alone may require about 1% to 3% of the total electric energy output of a country, representing a significant fraction of municipal energy bills. Specific power consumption of state-of-the-art facilities should range between 20 and 45 kWh per population-equivalent served, per year, even though older plants may have even higher demands. This figure does not include wastewater conveyance (pumping) and residues post-processing. On the other hand, wastewater and its byproducts contain energy in different forms: chemical, thermal and potential. Until very recently, the only form of energy recovery from most facilities consisted of anaerobic post-digestion of process residuals (waste sludge), by which chemical energy methane is obtained as biogas, in amounts generally sufficient to cover about half of plant requirements. Implementation of new technologies may allow more efficient strategies of energy savings and recovery from sewage treatment. Besides wastewater valorization by exploitation of its chemical and thermal energy contents, closure of the wastewater cycle by recovery of the energy content of process residuals could allow significant additional energy recovery and increased greenhouse emissions abatement. © 2019 by the authors.","Energy demand; Energy recovery; GHGs reduction; Urban used water cycle; Waste sludge; Wastewater treatment plant; Water-energy nexus","demand analysis; emission control; energy planning; energy use; greenhouse gas; methane; savings; sludge; urban area; waste treatment; wastewater treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078050472

The burrowing crab Neohelice granulata aids the development of larvae of the stem-boring moth Haimbachia sp. nov. within the stems of Spartina alterniflora. In our research, we evaluated whether the stem-boring moth subsequently influences crab feeding on these marsh plants. Surveys and experiments in a tidal marsh of the SW Atlantic coast (36° 22' S) showed that at the beginning of the stem-boring moth attack there was no difference in crab herbivory between plants with or without larvae of the stem-boring moth. However, after 3.5 mo, crabs foraged more on plants without larvae than on those with larvae. Plant tissue analyses showed a decrease in leaf tissue carbon concentrations in plants with larvae. This change in the nutritional quality of leaves, caused by construction of the stem-boring moth galleries, could explain the segregation in plant use between both herbivores. Unlike an allelochemical response, the non-specificity of the induced nutritional change could impair a wide variety of herbivores regardless of their feeding modes or taxonomic proximity. These effects could propagate bottom-up through the food-web, leading to more diffuse interspecific effects. Thus, here we show how the benefactor-beneficiary feedback between herbivores can be important for the maintenance of species coexistence and the functioning of communities. © Inter-Research 2020 ·.int-res.com","Benefactor-beneficiary relationship; Crabs; Facilitation; Herbivory; Indirect interactions; Plant-mediated interactions; Positive-negative interactions; Salt marsh; Stem-boring moth","boring organism; burrowing organism; coexistence; crab; facilitation; marsh; moth; saltmarsh; stem borer; temporal variation; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Southwest); Decapoda (Crustacea); Lepidoptera; Spartina alterniflora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081971791

Also, an attempt has been made to predict the future landfill gas production capacity with emission reduction strategies. The decreased emission factors are estimated according to the IPCC Methodology. The 3rd order polynomial was found to be the best fit according to the main statistical findings. This result is also strengthened by model performance tests which showed 2% uncertainty value. This value is very low as compared to the other models. Methane emission from waste disposal sites is approximately 4% of Turkey's total GHGs emissions throughout the years. If this gas is collected to produce biogas, the 4% of total GHG emissions will be saved and not given to the atmosphere. Using collected methane as fuel for energy production will further decrease the GHG emissions by 1.6% simply because the countries are not obliged to include CO2 emission from biogas consumption into GHG inventory according to the UNFCCC. Based on these results, it is possible to reduce the atmospheric emissions of GHGs and to use this gas in green energy production. There is a very high potential of producing renewable energy in Turkey by using landfill gases and this potential can be used for mitigation of GHGs emissions into the atmosphere. The CH4 production capacity of waste disposal sites is expected to increase up to 5.6 million tons/year by 2030. This means 25.4 million kW/year electricity can be produced from landfill gas. This production will result in 25 million tons of reduction in CO2 eq. emission in Turkey. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biogas production; CH4 emission; Climate change; Solid waste","Air pollution; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Electric power generation; Emission control; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Land fill; Methane; Municipal solid waste; Renewable energy resources; Solid wastes; Atmospheric emission; Biogas production; Emission reduction strategy; Green energy production; Production capacity; Statistical finding; Statistical modeling; Waste disposal sites; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073121691

Landscape planning requires clear aims and quantitative approaches to identify which key elements can reinforce the spatial coherence of protected areas design. We aim to explore the probability of the ecological connectivity of forest remnants and amphibian species distributions for current and future climate scenarios across the Central Corridor of the Brazilian Atlantic Forest. Integrating amphibian conservation, climate change and ecological corridors, we design a landscape ranking based on graph and circuit theories. To identify the sensitivity of connected areas to climate-dependent changes, we use the Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate by means of simulations for 2080–2100, representing a moderated emission scenario within an optimistic context. Our findings indicate that more than 70% of forest connectivity loss by climate change may drastically reduce amphibian dispersal in this region. We show that high amphibian turnover rates tend to be greater in the north-eastern edges of the corridor across ensembles of forecasts. Our spatial analysis reveals a general pattern of low-conductance areas in landscape surface, yet with some well-connected patches suggesting potential ecological corridors. Atlantic Forest reserves are expected to be less effective in a near future. For improved conservation outcomes, we recommend some landscape paths with low resistance values across space and time.

The aims of this study were to understand how different cultivars in different regions are responding to changes in climate, in order to inform future cultivar selections. Methods and Results: Trends in the day of year maturity (DOYM) between 1999 and 2018 were analysed for 23 grape cultivars (covering at least 7 years) and four Victorian vineyard regions against vintage year, seasonal growing degree day (GDDSep–Mar) and Spring Index. In most cases there were significant trends in DOYM advancement as a function of GDDSep–Mar and spring index. Temporal advancement of DOYM was more variable. One cultivar showed a significant advancement at two of three sites and another showed a significant delay. Different cultivars advanced DOYM at significantly different rates at a given site, later ripening cultivars advanced DOYM faster than earlier ripening cultivars and for a cultivar grown across several sites, the DOYM advancement was faster at cooler sites. Conclusions: Grapevine cultivars respond to warming temperature differently and the advancement of grape maturity is predicted to slow as temperature further increases. Significance of the Study: The study showed diversity in the phenological response of cultivars to temperature, which may be utilised to better adapt to climate change. © 2019 Australian Society of Viticulture and Oenology Inc.","compression of the harvest period; day of year maturity; grapevine; growing degree day; spring index",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076762216

Calthorpe takes it as a given that climate change is an imminent threat and potential catastrophe but recognizes that on a per capita basis, dense cities like New York produce less carbon and damage the environment less than suburbs and rural areas making planning carbon-neutral cities for the future the major urban planning challenge everywhere in the world. For the US, what Calthorpe calls “the twelve percent solution” - cutting per capita greenhouse gas emissions to just 12 percent of their current level by 2050 - will require deep changes, not only in our energy sources, technology, and conservation means, but also in urban design, culture and lifestyles. His unique contribution to the debate about what to do about climate change is the role that urbanism can play in reducing climate change. Developing solar, wind, wave, geothermal, biomass, perhaps even nuclear power in place of oil and coal will be critical. So will conservation and restoration of habitat that can absorb carbon. So will alternative energy vehicles and better stewardship of the environment and natural resources. But for Calthorpe, a major contribution to reducing global climate change is better planning of cities and metropolitan regions - particularly more compact cities with better linkage between land use and transportation. Calthorpe’s designs are at the forefront of planning compact, livable, mixed-use, pedestrian-friendly cities. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Richard T.

Currently, one of the building stocks most at risk is that of the residential sector in southern Spain, given the high sensitivity of the Mediterranean climate to the effects of climate change and the massive volume of this built environment with obsolete energy conditions. However, it is crucial to carry out an in-depth assessment of the necessary retrofitting strategies for implementation in this existing stock, with an overall analysis of building characterisation and current state of the building stock. This research takes these aspects into consideration, using statistical descriptive techniques to evaluate the building characterisation of public social housing in southern Spain. This public sector is managed by the Regional Government of Andalusia and is made up of 39.486 social housing units.

For this reason, we introduce a novel concept whereby the interplay of range shifts and dispersal barriers of a particular spatial configuration can threaten the persistence of populations under a climate change scenario. We named this concept “C-trap,” based on the topographic shape of such barriers. After elaborating on the theoretical features of C-traps, we provide a simple method that combines environmental data and future climate projections to locate them spatially. We use this method to determine where high C-trap densities have the potential to further threaten the conservation of endangered, endemic animals across the world's terrestrial realm, in a climate change scenario. Our methodology detected potential C-traps for the study system, with areas of high density mostly located in east Europe, south Asia and North America. However, finer-scale analyses are required to assess the magnitude of the threat locally. Dispersal barriers add an additional dimension to range shift studies and can ultimately prevent otherwise successful climate migrants from tracking their climatic niche. The methodology presented here is simple and flexible enough to be adapted to a wide range of taxa and locations as well as the fast development of range shift modeling. Therefore, we encourage researchers to include the effects of anthropogenic dispersal barriers in range shifts models and in the planning of effective conservation strategies with reference to climate change. © 2019 International Society of Zoological Sciences, Institute of Zoology/Chinese Academy of Sciences and John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd","anthropogenic; climate change; land cover; range shift; trap","climate change; human; migration; theoretical model; Climate Change; Human Migration; Humans; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078296309

The analysis is based on interviews with 33 typical farmers cultivating organic soils and on expert group discussions held in six different Northern, Eastern and Central European regions. Based on the Social-Ecological System Framework we identify and cluster important variables. Our results show that mainly hard economic variables determine preferred land use alternatives: the productivity of resource systems, the economic value of land and market incentives. Other variables, such as the heterogeneity of users and conflicts among them, are more important with respect to the implementation of alternatives.

Recent experimental and simulation efforts provide evidence that increased efficiency and reduced smoke emissions coincide with the formation of long-lived, energetic vortices during the mixing-controlled portion of the combustion event. These vortices are believed to promote fuel-air mixing, increase heat-release rates, and improve air utilization, but they become weaker as main injection timing is advanced nearer to the top dead center (TDC). Further efficiency and emissions benefits may be realized if vortex formation can be strengthened for near-TDC injections. This work presents a simulation-based analysis of turbulent flow evolution within a stepped-lip combustion chamber. A conceptual model summarizes key processes in the evolution of turbulent flow for main injections starting after TDC. Differences in turbulent flow evolution are described for a near-TDC main injection, and potential variations in combustion system design and operating parameters to enhance vortex formation under these conditions are hypothesized. The parametric studies executed to test these hypotheses reveal that while intake pressure and spray targeting play important roles in turbulent flow evolution, they are not capable of fundamentally changing the late-cycle flow topology for near-TDC injection timings. A dimpled stepped-lip (DSL) piston design is developed that supports the hypothesis that increasing space in the squish region promotes vortex formation for near-TDC injection timings. Further analyses reveal the mechanisms by which the DSL piston strengthens vortex formation. © 2020 SAE International; Ford Motor Company; Sandia.","Diesel combustion chamber design; Diesel engine internal flow; Spray-wall interactions; Stepped-lip piston","Diesel engines; Digital subscriber lines; Efficiency; Fuel systems; Mixing; Pistons; Smoke; Systems analysis; Topping cycle systems; Turbulent flow; Combustion systems; Conceptual model; Energetic vortices; Heat Release Rate (HRR); Operating parameters; Parametric study; Potential variations; Simulation-based analysis; Vortex flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089976356

Here we systematically catalog whether second-tier governments in 30 tropical countries with high projected future emissions from deforestation possess 14 distinct types of general and forest-related authority. We compile this information in a free, open-access database. Second-tier governments have broadest authority to reduce deforestation in India, Brazil, Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, Peru, China, Laos, Mozambique, and Vietnam. Second-tier governments have the least authority in Central African Republic, Gabon, Angola, Madagascar, Bolivia, Cambodia, Cameroon, Guyana, Suriname, Thailand, and Venezuela. Second-tier governments have intermediate authority in Democratic Republic of Congo, Ecuador, Mexico, the Philippines, Colombia, Myanmar, Tanzania, Zambia, Mexico, and Republic of Congo. Authorities that second-tier governments most commonly possess include development planning, taxation, budgeting, and roads. Authorities that second-tier governments least commonly possess include land ownership, police, permits for mining, Indigenous affairs, and protected areas. Authorities possessed by an intermediate number of second-tier governments include spatial planning, elections, courts, and permits for agriculture. More than one-quarter of future emissions from deforestation between 2020 and 2050 is projected to come from just seven out of 678 second-tier jurisdictions: Amazonas, Pará, and Mato Grosso (Brazil), Équateur and Orientale (Democratic Republic of Congo), Loreto (Peru), and El Beni (Bolivia). After weighting for authority, our list of the 50 second-tier jurisdictions in the tropics that are the highest priority for reducing emissions from deforestation shifts to include fewer second-tier jurisdictions in Africa (where second-tier governments have 4.2 authorities out of 14 in the average country) and Latin America (6.3 authorities out of 14) and more second-tier jurisdictions in Asia (8.5 authorities out of 14). Second-tier jurisdictions that have formally expressed interest in reducing emissions from deforestation, e.g., through the Governors' Climate and Forest Task Force, Under2 Coalition, or New York Declaration on Forests, possess greater authority to reduce deforestation on average than other jurisdictions. Information on second-tier governmental authority, when complemented with deeper country-specific knowledge, can help initiatives for reducing emissions from deforestation (REDD+) prioritize support across regions and across sectoral interventions. © Copyright © 2020 Busch and Amarjargal.","climate change; decentralization; jurisdictional approach; multi-level governance; REDD+; sub-national government",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087894018

Water treatment, an indispensable step for safeguarding public health, is an energy-intensive process. The purpose of this study was to analyze the energy consumption of an existing drinking water treatment plant (DWTP), then conduct a modeling study for using photovoltaics (PVs) to offset that energy consumption, and thus reduce emissions. The selected plant, located in southwestern United States, treats 0.425 m3 of groundwater per second by utilizing the processes of coagulation, filtration, and disinfection. Based on the energy consumption individually determined for each unit process (validated using the DWTP's data), the DWTP was sized for PVs (as a modeling study). The results showed that the dependency of a DWTP on the traditional electric grid could be greatly reduced by the use of PVs. The largest consumption of energy was associated with the pumping operations, corresponding to 150.6 Wh m-3 for the booster pumps to covey water to the storage tanks, while the energy intensity of the water treatment units was found to be 3.1 Wh m-3. A PV system with a 1.5MWcapacity with battery storage (30MWh) was found to have a positive net present value and a levelized cost of electricity of 3.1 cents kWh-1. A net reduction in the carbon emissions was found as 950 and 570 metric tons of CO2-eq year-1 due to the PV-based design, with and without battery storage, respectively. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Drinkingwater treatment; Energy consumption; Photovoltaics; Solar energy; Techno-economic assessment","Battery storage; Carbon; Chemical water treatment; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Groundwater; Potable water; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Carbon emissions; Consumption of energy; Drinkingwater treatment; Levelized cost of electricities; Photovoltaics; Sustainability considerations; Techno-economic assessment; Water treatment unit; Energy utilization; alternative energy; carbon emission; drinking water; emission control; photovoltaic system; solar power; water industry; water treatment plant; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079507303

While in-field agrobiodiversity is a critical route to such a transition, riparian systems remain an important, yet understudied, pathway to achieve key diversity and ecosystem services and targets. Notably, at the interface of agricultural landscapes and aquatic systems, the diversification of riparian buffers with trees reduces the non-point source pollution in waterways. However, in riparian agroforestry systems, little is known about herbaceous community patterns and, importantly, the herbaceous community's role in governing carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling. Our study investigated herbaceous community taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity patterns in riparian (i) grasslands (GRASSLAND), (ii) rehabilitated agroforests (AGROFOREST-REHAB), and (iii) remnant forests (AGROFOREST-NATURAL).We then determined the biodiversity-ecosystem function relationships between community functional diversity metrics, C and N cycling, and greenhouse gas fluxes. We observed significant differences in taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity among riparian buffer types. We found that herbaceous plant communities in riparian agroforestry systems expressed plant trait syndromes associated with fast-growing, resource acquiring strategies, while grassland buffer plants exhibited slow-growing, resource conserving strategies. Herbaceous communities with high functional diversity and resource acquiring trait syndromes, such as those in the agroforestry riparian systems, were significantly correlated with lower rates of soil CO2 eux and N mineralization, both of which are key fluxes related to ecosystem service delivery. Our findings provide further evidence that functionally diverse, and not necessarily taxonomically diverse, plant communities are strongly correlated to positive ecosystem processes in riparian agroforestry systems, and that these communities contribute to the transition of agricultural lands toward biologically and functionally diverse landscapes. © 2020 by the authors.","Agrobiodiversity; Functional diversity; Greenhouse gas fluxes; Plant functional traits; Riparian agroforestry; Soil CO2 eux; Soil N mineralization","agricultural ecosystem; agroforestry; biomineralization; carbon flux; ecosystem service; functional role; greenhouse gas; herb; nonpoint source pollution; riparian vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079647887

Next, it turns to a consideration of the relationship of climate change to global dislocation, ‘cultural extinction’ and social exclusion. From here, it contemplates ‘climate reductionism’ and the dangers of ascribing all changes in environment and society to climate. Recognising that climate change may not be the central-or driving-factor in/for all present or future environmental issues, the authors argue that green criminologists must maintain the strong and broad research agenda that has helped green criminology develop so well to date. They illustrate how this might be done with an analysis of ‘atmospheric injustice’ and the ways in which air pollution is creating a local and global ‘health divide’. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Avi Brisman and Nigel South; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85121522920

Emergent constraints aim to reduce these uncertainties by finding links between the inter-model spread in an observable predictor and climate projections. In this paper, the concepts underlying this framework are recalled with an emphasis on the statistical inference used for narrowing uncertainties, and a review of emergent constraints found in the last two decades. Potential links between highlighted predictors are explored, especially those targeting uncertainty reductions in climate sensitivity, cloud feedback, and changes of the hydrological cycle. Yet the disagreement across emergent constraints suggests that the spread in climate sensitivity can not be significantly narrowed. This calls for weighting the realism of emergent constraints by quantifying the level of physical understanding explaining the relationship. This would also permit more efficient model evaluation and better targeted model development. In the context of the upcoming CMIP6 model intercomparison a growing number of new predictors and uncertainty reductions is expected, which call for robust statistical inferences that allow cross-validation of more likely estimates. © 2020, Institute of Atmospheric Physics/Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","climate change; climate modeling; climate sensitivity; emergent constraint",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076403225

CO2 direct air capture (DAC) is among the most promising negative emission technologies (NETs). The energy demands for low-temperature solid-sorbent DAC are mainly heat at around 100 °C and electricity, which lead to sustainably operated DAC systems based on low-cost renewable electricity and heat pumps for the heat supply. This analysis is carried out for the case of the Maghreb region, which enjoys abundantly available low-cost renewable energy resources. The energy transition results for the Maghreb region lead to a solar photovoltaic (PV)-dominated energy supply with some wind energy contribution. DAC systems will need the same energy supply structure. The research investigates the levelised cost of CO2 DAC (LCOD) in high spatial resolution and is based on full hourly modelling for the Maghreb region. The key results are LCOD of about 55 €/tCO2 in 2050 with a further cost reduction potential of up to 50%. The area demand is considered and concluded to be negligible. Major conclusions for CO2 removal as a new energy sector are drawn. Key options for a global climate change mitigation strategy are first an energy transition towards renewable energy and second NETs for achieving the targets of the Paris Agreement. © 2019, The Author(s).","100% renewable energy; CO2 direct air capture; Energy transition; Maghreb; Negative emission technology","alternative energy; carbon dioxide; climate change; electricity; electricity industry; energy resource; global climate; spatial resolution; Maghreb",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061067234

The role of metal oxides in these devices has been diverse, from charge transport layers to catalytic surfaces to protective blocking layers. Understanding the fundamental structural and electronic properties of these materials will continue to allow for advancement in the field of renewable energy. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is one of the most utilized methods to characterize these electrodes in the context of energy applications. The utility of EIS stems from its ability to differentiate multiple interfaces (i.e., solid/electrolyte, solid/solid) within devices on the basis of their frequency response to a modulated potential and the subsequent decoupling of resistive and capacitive circuit components. In this review, the fundamental theory of EIS is first described with a physical and mathematical basis, followed by a discussion of equivalent circuit modeling. The review then covers examples from the literature where EIS has been particularly important in the understanding of electronic properties related to metal oxide electrodes within energy conversion and storage devices. A specific focus is placed on metal oxides that are used as heterojunction solar cells, ion batteries, and photocatalysts/electrocatalysts. Common themes are discussed within each application such as the study of electron and hole diffusion in solar cells, the dependence of recombination reactions and catalysis on surface defect/trap states for solar cells and photocatalysts, and the formation of passivation layers at the solid electrolyte interface in Li-ion batteries.

Unprecedented opportunities lie ahead for local renewable energy development. Proper system and resource integration is therefore an economic imperative. Technical and economic integration will require policy alignment and collaboration among cities, counties, energy utilities (both gas and electric), and state government. There is also a potentially invaluable role for higher education in support of local planning and integration. State policy interventions in support of collaborative local renewable integration will be a necessary supplement to existing market and regulatory structures. States can affirm fundamental property rights that empower communities and citizens to actively support local climate action and adaptation. State policy can drive the evolution of existing market and regulatory structures to account for local differences and provide increased flexibility for local jurisdictions to address their diverse local resource opportunities and usage profiles. In parallel, states can encourage cities and counties to increase their capacity to take on vital new roles. State energy regulators will need to balance public interest in the economic health of the companies against they regulate against the opportunity to secure important benefits of local clean energy resource development and integration. They will need to create new processes for harmonizing and cross-leveraging progress toward diverse local goals with progress toward over-arching state goals. The key enabling factor will be a culture of collaboration between energy service providers and local governments. Collaborative local renewable integration can be empowered by state action that creates new points of coordination, integration and assistance. Through policy interventions, states can reduce or eliminate barriers to collaborative local renewable integration while capturing opportunities to bring together local government and energy utility capacities and data, plus capacities of universities, non-profit and utility training programs. © 2019 The Author","Cities; Climate action; Collaboration; Community choice; Community solar; Counties; Electricity; Integration; Local government; Micro-grids; Natural gas; Renewable energy; Solar energy; State policy; Universities; Utilities; Utility training",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075519540

However, the controlling mechanisms are still poorly understood, particularly the role of fertiliser-ammonium oxidation. This study therefore assessed the effects of aglime on soil inorganic C (SIC)– and soil organic C (SOC)–derived CO2 emissions from acid soils amended with ammonium. Materials and methods: Ammonium at three N rates [0% (A0), 0.005% (A1), and 0.2% (A2) w/w] and labelled aglime (Ca13CO3, 13C 5.94% aa) at three rates [0% (L1), 0.067% (L1), and 0.392% (L2) w/w] were applied to two contrasting acid soils (Nariva series, Mollic Fluvaquents; and Piarco series, Typic Kanhaplaquults) and incubated in 1-l media bottles for 23 days. A calcareous soil (Princes Town series, Aquentic Eutrudepts, carbonate δ13C of − 4.79‰) was included as a control that only received ammonium at the three rates. Results and discussion: The application of ammonium at the A2 rate significantly (p &lt; 0.05) increased cumulative SIC-CO2 emissions by 15.8 and 27.1% in comparison to the A0 rate for the Nariva and Piarco soils, respectively, when they were limed at the L2 rate. The lower rate of ammonium (A1), however, had no effect on these emissions, which suggests that enough acidity may not have been generated at this rate to significantly enhance the release of SIC-CO2. Furthermore, no effect of ammonium rates was observed on SIC-CO2 emissions from the calcareous soil, which refutes the hypothesis that this amendment plays a greater role in regulating these emissions from calcareous soils compared with acid soils. Also, in contradiction to another hypothesis, the aglime-induced priming effect on SOC decomposition was more apparent in the low-C Piarco soil. This effect was also significantly (p &lt; 0.05) greater at the L2 rate (above the lime requirement for Piarco), which demonstrates the negative impact that over-liming could have on the sequestration of C in this soil. Our results also showed that ammonium addition may also help to reduce the magnitude of the aglime-induced priming effect in the Piarco soil when it is not over-limed. Conclusions: Overall, the findings of this study suggest that ammonium fertiliser broadcast at conventional rates may not serve as a significant regulator of SIC-CO2 emissions from highly to moderately acidic soils amended with aglime. Our findings also indicate a need to consider nitrogen management as an important factor regulating the effects of aglime on SOC-CO2 emissions. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","13C; Acid and calcareous soils; Aglime; Ammonium (NH4 +) fertiliser; Carbon dioxide (CO2); Priming effects","acid soil; ammonium; calcareous soil; carbon dioxide; fertilizer application; inorganic carbon; lime; organic carbon; soil amendment; soil emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069860085

The efficacy of regulatory measures in nonattainment areas, such as the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria (HGB) area of Texas, can be efficiently evaluated by separating the meteorologically induced variability from ozone data. This study applies the Kolmogorov-Zurbenko (KZ) filter for obtaining a temporal resolution of ozone, NOx and VOC data into short-term, seasonal and long-term components, at three stations located near the Houston Ship Channel. Air quality and meteorological data for Clinton (AQS Site ID: 48-201-1035), Deer Park (48-201-1039) and Lynchburg Ferry (48-201-1015) stations were analyzed for the period between 2003 and 2017. A combination of KZ filter and multiple linear regression, with predictor variables (solar radiation, temperature, dew point, and wind speed) is employed to develop meteorologically independent ozone, NOx and VOC trends. This study indicates that variability from meteorology accounts for 51%, 35% and 41% in baseline MDA8 ozone at Clinton, Deer Park, and Lynchburg stations, respectively. For the 15-year study period, long-term MDA8 ozone trends for Deer Park and Lynchburg stations were decreasing at a linear rate of 0.689 ± 0.016, and 0.573 ± 0.019 ppb/yr, respectively. At the Deer Park and Lynchburg stations, a high degree of correlation for meteorologically detrended MDA8 ozone with NOx (ρ: 0.899, 0.678) and VOC (ρ: 0.912) concentrations was observed. For the Clinton station, decreases in NOx and VOC levels d at the rate of 2.068 ± 0.032 ppb/yr and 14.637 ± 0.412 ppb C/yr, were not reflected in MDA8 ozone, which showed no discernable decrease over the 15 years. The regional transport of ozone plumes from the east and south-east directions of the Clinton station were identified as the likely factors for this pattern. Implications: The efficacy of emission control policies in the Houston-Galveston-Brazoria area can be evaluated by isolating the meteorological forcing from air quality time series data and developing long-term trends for ozone and precursor compounds. This paper applies the Kolmogorov–Zurbenko filter technique in combination with Multiple Linear Regression analysis to MDA8/MDA1 ozone, NOx, and VOC data between 2003-2017 at three air monitoring stations near the Houston Ship Channel.

Data collection was done through mixed methods approach, comprising of questionnaire survey and focus group discussions from a total of 167 farmers selected using a stratified random sampling design. The findings revealed that all the interviewed respondents had heard about climate change through different sources of communication. Farmers attested to the fact that they were aware of the changing climate through key indicators such as increasing temperatures (92.2%), delayed rainfalls (96.4%) and a shift in onset of rains (98.8%) leading to drought, decreased agricultural yields and land degradation. Farmers employed several strategies in response to climate change, and these included the use of drought tolerant and early maturing crop varieties (73.1%), crop diversification (50.3%) and supplementary feeding for livestock (41.9%). Nevertheless, majority of the respondents (55.7 %) cited lack of capital as the main barrier to effective adaptation, followed by agricultural pests (52.1%), drought (51.5%), human-wildlife conflict (46.7%) and lack of inputs (44.9%). It is recommended that the agricultural sector needs to build farmers’ adaptive capacity, knowledge and practices through climate smart interventions to enhance resilience of rural livelihoods. © 2020 Fundacion CIPAV.

In parallel, the decarbonization agenda and rapid technological progress lead the way toward a renewable-based and distributed electricity system, in which new business models emerge. Distributed resources, prosumers, and peer-to-peer trading are all part of the most likely future scenarios. The newly adopted Clean Energy Package, put forward by the European Commission in 2016, responded to the consensus that existing electricity markets needed to adapt and aimed at putting consumers at the center. But will the ongoing reforms live up to the challenges posed by the coming stages of the ongoing Green Transition? While most recent analyses focus on wholesale issues, the present review narrows this gap. We analyze the European Union (EU) retail electricity market design in isolation, but also in its interaction with the renewable energy policy. We compare the current and the forthcoming legislative framework to elucidate if the recently adopted reforms mitigate conflicts or facilitate complementarities arising from the implementation of the European energy policy framework. While the reforms remove fundamental barriers for consumer participation, several unresolved conflicts remain. Thus, looking forward, there is a significant implementation challenge. Among these are the overdue task of making competition effective, striking the right balance between the verticality and horizontality of the future retail market and confronting market reconfiguration. In this respect, the paper makes several policy recommendations aimed at EU Member States, which are also valid for any jurisdiction willing to advance a transition to renewables.

Although the conformation of meibum lipids has been studied rigorously, that of tear lipids has not.Methods:Tear lipids (TLHSCT) and meibum (MHSCT) from patients who had hematopoietic stem cell transplantation were pooled prospectively. The infrared spectra of meibum from donors with (MMGD) and without (Mn) meibomian gland dysfunction were retrospectively analyzed to measure the lipid composition and structure. The infrared CH stretching region was used to measure the relative content of CH3 and CH2 moieties in the meibum.Results:The 3 major findings of the current study are as follows: 1) compared with Mn, MHSCT and MMGD had 18% fewer CH3 moieties; 2) compared with MHSCT, the phase transition temperature, cooperativity, and order were approximately 20% greater for TLHSCT; and 3) compared with Mn and MMGD, MHSCT and TLHSCT contained fewer double bonds.Conclusions:Tear lipids are more ordered than meibum lipids, which could have functional consequences. The human meibum peak height ratio of the CH3/CH2 bands is not a factor related to tear film stability with age or sex. The amount of CH3 moieties relative to CH2 moieties and saturation could contribute to a higher meibum lipid order associated with a younger age, meibomian gland dysfunction, and dry eye from hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.

Data for this study were collected from a nationally representative random survey of 5,184 adults conducted between March and April of 2017. Filipinos self-report relatively low levels of knowledge of climate change and cited increased temperatures, shifts in seasons, and heavier rains as the most likely consequences. Levels of disaster preparedness in the Philippines differ widely by region. Although most Filipinos perceive that natural hazards are a risk to them, only a third of Filipinos undertake measures to prepare for disasters. Filipinos who perceive climate-related changes directly impacting their households report taking greater action to prepare for disasters. Filipinos who believe they have been directly impacted by climate-related changes are also more likely to prepare for disasters, take planning actions, and undertake material actions to prepare, such as dwelling improvements. Other factors associated with disaster preparedness include gender, membership in an association, wealth, risk perception, and prior exposure to and losses due to disasters. The findings imply that, while posing different challenges and requiring different responses, adaptation to climate change and disaster preparedness are inherently associated and potentially mutually reinforcing. Policies and programs would arguably benefit from a more unified intervention framework that links climate change adaptation and disaster preparedness. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change; Disaster preparedness; Resilience; The Philippines",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094145481

Yet, in energy, member states have remained particularly jealous of their sovereignty, limiting the pace and scope of integration. EU energy policy appears to fit the specifications of ‘new intergovernmentalism’ (NI). Member states have been keen on reinforcing cooperation but have refrained from delegating further authority to supranational institutions, preferring to maintain a high level of control within the Council and European Council. However, focusing on the Energy Union Governance Regulation adopted in 2018, we argue that the sector does not fit neatly within this NI account. Although governments remain central to the process, they operate within a hybrid institutional framework combining supranational and intergovernmental elements, in which formal and informal authority distribution is unstable and contested.

We argue that one cornerstone for whether climate engineering, and solar radiation management in particular, could gain legitimacy in China, is its current weather modification programme. In China, weather modification is institutionalized and deployed on a large scale, and current narratives around the legitimacy to intervene into the local climate may provide a rationale for interventions such as solar radiation management. In the end, in the same way as Deng Xiaoping coined the phrase “stepping on stones to cross the river” in the era of China’s Industrial Civilization, narrating China's “Ecological Civilization” may want to make use of “seeding the clouds to reach the sky”.

Yet, most of the countries that have signed the charter do not burn coal in large quantities. Some do not even burn coal at all. This raises an important question: Why do countries join such an Alliance? We advance four hypotheses that revolve around material costs, political economy, feedback effects, and identity. We conduct a study of 38 country cases. Through a crisp set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (csQCA) we test which combination of variables explains our outcome of interest (state membership in the PPCA). The results indicate that countries that have no coal in their electricity mix and that have adopted a phase-out plan are most likely to join the PPCA. There are two combinations of conditions almost always lead to the outcome: Countries join the PPCA if they have a phase-out plan and are a climate leader, or they have a phase-out plan and do not have a strong coal industry. Conversely, the solution for non-membership shows that countries do not join the PPCA if they are not a climate leader and do not have a phase out plan, or have a strong coal industry. The results further suggest that the PPCA should focus on different outreach methods, beyond merely expanding its membership, including technical diplomacy and maintaining political momentum at high-level political events. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anti-fossil fuel norm; Coal phase-out; Coal-fired power generation; Powering Past Coal Alliance (PPCA); Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072612734

The recently demonstrated concept of an Al-graphite battery represents some significant progress for the technology, but the cell energy density is still very modest and limited by the quantity of the AlCl3 based electrolyte, as it relies on AlCl4 ‒ intercalation. For further progress, cathode materials capable of an electrochemical reaction with Al positively charged species are needed. Here such a concept of an Al metal anode ‒ organic cathode battery based on anthraquinone (AQ) electrochemistry with a discharge voltage of 1.1 V is demonstrated. Further improvement of both the cell capacity retention and rate capability is achieved by nano-structured and polymerized cathodes. The intricate electrochemical mechanism is proven to be that the anthraquinone groups undergo reduction of their carbonyl bonds during discharge and become coordinated by AlCl2+ species.

Bromegrasses (Bromus spp.) are economically important forage species in the temperate regions of world, but genetic gain in forage yield of bromegrass is relatively low. In particular, limited breeding efforts have been made in improving abiotic stress tolerance and resource-use efficiency. We conducted a literature review on bromegrass breeding achievements and challenges, global climate change impacts on bromegrass species, and explored the feasibility of applying high-throughput imaging phenotyping techniques and genomic selection for further advances in forage yield and quality selection. Overall genetic gain in forage yield of bromegrass has been low, but genetic improvement in forage yield of smooth bromegrass (Bromus inermis Leyss) is somewhat higher than that of meadow bromegrass (Bromus riparius Rehm). This low genetic gain in bromegrass yield is due to a few factors such as its genetic complexity, lack of long-term breeding effort, and inadequate plant adaptation to changing climate. Studies examining the impacts of global climate change on bromegrass species show that global warming, heat stress, and drought have negative effects on forage yield. A number of useful physiological traits have been identified for genetic improvement to minimize yield loss. Available reports suggest that high-throughput imaging phenotyping techniques, including visual and infrared thermal imaging, imaging hyperspectral spectroscopy, and imaging chlorophyll fluorescence, are capable of capturing images of morphological, physiological, and biochemical traits related to plant growth, yield, and adaptation to abiotic stresses at different scales of organization. The more complex traits such as photosynthetic radiation-use efficiency, water-use efficiency, and nitrogen-use efficiency can be effectively assessed by utilizing combinations of imaging hyperspectral spectroscopy, infrared thermal imaging, and imaging chlorophyll fluorescence techniques in a breeding program. Genomic selection has been applied in the breeding of forage species and the applications show its potential in high ploidy, outcrossing species like bromegrass to improve the accuracy of parental selection and improve genetic gain. Together, these new technologies hold promise for improved genetic gain and wide adaptation in future bromegrass breeding. © Copyright © 2020 Biswas, Coulman, Biligetu and Fu.","abiotic stress; bromegrass species; climate change; crop adaptation; forage yield and quality; global warming; resource-use efficiency",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078738286

Investors often use scenario analysis as a part of strategic asset allocation and portfolio construction decisions. When it comes to climate change, many questions arise regarding available data, methods used, and their application. Econometric modelling that uses integrated data, while incomplete and evolving, is being used by investors to translate into scenarios for assessing the additional climate impact on investment return in tandem with bottom-up methods.

The constraints derived from the principle of charge conservation are introduced to improve the accuracy of both anode and cathode SOC estimations. Furthermore, the cathode SOC is estimated to represent the cell SOC for its fast convergence speed, which is due to the high magnitude of the cathode equilibrium potential. Approaches used to adaptively updating the covariance parameters of the filter based on the covariance matching method are also incorporated. As a result, the covariance matrix of process noise is adjusted automatically. Comparative studies of three nonlinear filters concerning estimation accuracy, error bounds, recovery time from an initial offset, and computational time revealed that the ASR-SPKF has the most outstanding performance. That is, 30% more accurate and 88% shorter the convergence time than the AEKF, and, computationally, 23% and 19% faster than the AEKF and ASPKF, respectively. Then, the proposed method was tested at different temperatures using a large-format lithium-ion battery with a nominal capacity of 42 Ah where the voltage and SOC error remained less than 22 mV and 2%, respectively. Finally, the proposed method was implemented in a battery-in-the-loop test station using a fast charging and a driving cycle profile, and the estimated voltage and SOC were compared with the experimental results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptive filtering; Equality state constraints; Lithium-ion battery; Reduced-order model; Square-root sigma-point Kalman filter; State-of-charge","Adaptive filtering; Adaptive filters; Cathodes; Covariance matrix; Error analysis; Fast charging (Batteries); Kalman filters; Lithium-ion batteries; Covariance matching method; Electrochemical modeling; Equilibrium potentials; Fast convergence speed; Reduced order models; Sigma point kalman filter; State constraints; State of charge; Battery management systems; accuracy assessment; electrochemical method; estimation method; experimental study; fuel cell; Kalman filter; numerical model; performance assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075766180

However, this valuable biomass is unfortunately burnt on field as waste that causes air pollution, global warming, plant nutrient losses and environment menace. About 60% of rice straw produced in Asia in general and India in particular is burnt in field. As for the basic requirement to predict their suitability for best alternative industrial uses biochemical, morphological and chemical (functional group) characterization of straws of 18 most widely grown rice cultivars from eastern region of India was carried out. Biochemical characterization was done on the basis of cellulose, hemicellulose, lignin and silica content. The surface morphology of straws was observed through Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), while, presence of functional groups were analyzed through Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. Primarily, quantified biochemical profiles were used to group cultivars for best alternate uses of straw like bio-ethanol, biochar, compost and mushroom production. Morphological feature (from SEM) of straw and functional group (through FTIR) were used to support the grouping. Cultivars with higher hemicelluloses and cellulose with low to medium lignin and Si were better suited for bio-ethanol production while, straw having higher lignin and low to medium cellulose and hemicellulose were selected for biochar. Therefore, considering all the three characterization methods (chemical composition, morphological features, presence or absence of functional groups), we found straws of rice cultivars, Tapaswini and IR 64 were best suited for bio-ethanol and biochar production, respectively. There are overlapping as well as contradictory observations found during grouping, when the three approaches were followed together. This indicate that the grouping of straw for better alternative uses could be done by biochemical and morphological characterization but this should be validated in small scale at farm or factory level for final recommendation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biochar; Biochemical profiling; Bioethanol; FTIR spectra; Rice straw characterization; Straw burning; Straw management","Bioethanol; Cellulose; Composting; Ethanol; Global warming; Lignin; Morphology; Scanning electron microscopy; Silica; Surface morphology; Bio chars; Biochemical profiling; FT-IR spectrum; Rice straws; Straw management; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; biochar; biochemistry; biofuel; biomass burning; cellulose; cultivar; detection method; straw; Anatomy; Cellulose; Composting; Ethanol; Scanning Electron Microscopy; Asia; India; Basidiomycota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075450209

While many reports focus on catalyst design or modification of additives such as Lewis or Bronsted acids, there is little focus on modification of the substrate, CO2 itself. Current carbon capture technology employs amines to capture CO2 as carbamates, suggesting that they may serve as a CO2 surrogate, streamlining carbon capture and recycling. Towards this, herein we explore the cyclic voltammetry of seven amines in the presence/absence of CO2. We show that on a glassy carbon electrode in acetonitrile (MeCN) up to -2.7 V vs Fc/Fc+ in tetrabutylammonium hexafluorophosphate (TBAPF6) electrolyte, the amines can only be reduced in the presence of CO2. The potential of the reduction is dependent on the amine identity as well as the protonation state of the resulting species, carbamate versus carbamic acid. Bulk electrolysis experiments indicate little or no reduction to CO and low Faradaic efficiency for formate. This suggests that these amines may be of use in subsequent studies with molecular electrocatalysts that take CO2 to CO and not formate. © 2020 The Author(s).

The study found that the community forests stored carbon stock ranging from 148.5 to 202.3 Mg ha–1 (mean: 175.5 Mg ha–1). The community forests managed for a longer duration have higher carbon stock than the community forests managed for a shorter duration. From the study, it can be concluded that these forests have been acting as a storehouse of the carbon. So, we can infer that community management has had a positive impact on increasing the carbon stock of forests and thus on the mitigation of global climate change.

However, the solvent effect on heterogeneously catalyzed reactions has only been partially studied and a rigorous analysis to interpret the results was carried out in very few cases. The main difficulty to reach satisfactory explanations on the solvent effect lies in the solid catalyst complex interactions with both reagents/products and the solvent, the latter generally being the main component in the reaction medium. Therefore, a comprehensive approach must consider all possible interactions that may take place: solvent-reagents and solvent-products interactions in homogeneous phase, and the reagents-catalyst and solvent-catalyst interactions on the solid surface. A type of reactions where this effect has been widely observed but deeply analyzed only in few cases are hydrogenation reactions, where a substrate undergoes reduction by the action of dissociatively chemisorbed hydrogen on the surface of a metal catalyst. In particular, the chemo-selective hydrogenation of carbonyl group (-C=O) of compounds having other potentially reducible functional groups is an important application of heterogeneous catalysis in fine chemistry. The selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehydes, ketones and ketoesters produces valuable alcohols of high commercial value that find application in pharmaceuticals, fragrances and flavors, food additives, intermediates for agrochemicals, etc. The majority of fine chemicals are obtained in multipurpose batch reactors at relatively small scale. Most of these processes are carried out using a solvent that accomplish at least one of the following functions: (a) dissolution of solid reagents; (b) control of conversion rate by dilution effect in very fast reactions; (c) dissipation of heat generated in highly exothermic reactions. Although the use of solvent has a negative environmental impact, in many situations its presence is absolutely necessary. In these cases, solvent selection is critical, since it can strongly influence the productivity of the process by modifying catalytic activity and/or selectivity. Moreover, an inappropriate solvent choice can lead to the failure of the catalytic process. In this work, a critical review of the state of the art about the solvent influence on the performance of metal catalysts in the hydrogenation of carbonyl compounds, specifically unsaturated aldehydes, ketones and ketoesters, is carried out. The study of the solvent effect on the selective hydrogenation of C=O group of the above mentioned carbonyl compounds is by far the most explored. However, there are many aspects that still need a deeper discussion to elucidate the solvent influence. Due to the nature of the carbonyl C atom in aldehydes, the solvent effect on activity and chemoselectivity is discussed. Instead, in the case of ketones and ketoesters, whose carbonyl C is prochiral, an additional effect on the enantioselectivity is also considered. The use of different physicochemical characterization methods and experimental laboratory techniques is discussed along the text in order to provide useful pieces of information that help to explain this phenomenon, a clearly challenging task at the light of its complexity. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.","Carbonyl group; Fine chemistry; Heterogeneous catalysis; Hydrogenation; Solvent effect",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096273970

The evaluation was based on two performance indicators: z-scores and the root mean square error weighted by the reference uncertainty (RMSEu), with pre-established acceptability criteria. By involving models based on completely different and independent input data, such as receptor models (RMs) and chemical transport models (CTMs), the intercomparison provided a unique opportunity for their cross-validation. In addition, comparing the CTM chemical profiles with those measured directly at the source contributed to corroborate the consistency of the tested model results. The most commonly used RM was the US EPA- PMF version 5. RMs showed very good performance for the overall dataset (91% of z-scores accepted) while more difficulties were observed with the source contribution time series (72% of RMSEu accepted). Industrial activities proved to be the most difficult sources to be quantified by RMs, with high variability in the estimated contributions. In the CTMs, the sum of computed source contributions was lower than the measured gravimetric PM10 mass concentrations. The performance tests pointed out the differences between the two CTM approaches used for source apportionment in this study: brute force (or emission reduction impact) and tagged species methods. The sources meeting the z-score and RMSEu acceptability criteria tests were 50% and 86%, respectively. The CTM source contributions to PM10 were in the majority of cases lower than the RM averages for the corresponding source. The CTMs and RMs source contributions for the overall dataset were more comparable (83% of the z-scores accepted) than their time series (successful RMSEu in the range 25% - 34%). The comparability between CTMs and RMs varied depending on the source: traffic/exhaust and industry were the source categories with the best results in the RMSEu tests while the most critical ones were soil dust and road dust. The differences between RMs and CTMs source reconstructions confirmed the importance of cross validating the results of these two families of models. © 2019 The Authors","Chemical transport models; Intercomparison; Lens; PM10; Receptor models; Source apportionment","Air quality; Dust; Emission control; Lenses; Mean square error; Soil testing; Time series; Chemical transport models; Intercomparisons; PM10; Receptor model; Source apportionment; Quality control; air quality; atmospheric modeling; industrial emission; particulate matter; source apportionment; air quality; article; Europe; performance; soil; time series analysis; uncertainty; Europe; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074932830

The MIRI coronagraph on the James Webb Space Telescope can search the 1–3au (1″–2″) region around α Cen A which is predicted to be stable within the α Cen AB system. We demonstrate that with reasonable performance of the telescope and instrument, a 20 hr program combining on-target and reference star observations at 15.5 μm could detect thermal emission from planets as small as ∼5 R⊕. Multiple visits every 3–6 months would increase the geometrical completeness, provide astrometric confirmation of detected sources, and push the radius limit down to ∼3 R⊕. An exozodiacal cloud only a few times brighter than our own should also be detectable, although a sufficiently bright cloud might obscure any planet present in the system. While current precision radial velocity (PRV) observationssetalimitof50–100 M⊕ at 1–3 au for planets orbiting α Cen A, there is a broad range of exoplanet radii up to 10 R⊕ consistent with these mass limits. A carefully planned observing sequence along with state-of-the-art post-processing analysis could reject the light from α Cen A at the level of ∼10−5 at 1″–2″ and minimize the influence of α Cen B located 7″–8″ away in the 2022–2023 timeframe. These space-based observations would complement on-going imaging experiments at shorter wavelengths as well as PRV and astrometric experiments to detect planets dynamically. Planetary demographics suggest that the likelihood of directly imaging a planet whose mass and orbit are consistent with present PRV limits is small, ∼5%, and possibly lower if the presence of a binary companion further reduces occurrence rates.

It is, therefore, necessary to identify suitable coping strategies to facilitate sustainable growth of agriculture in the rain-fed regions through conservation and efficient use of water. This paper identifies the factors influencing households’ perception about changing climate in the Indian state of Odisha and West Bengal. The chapter uses primary data and information collected from 1, 100 households under 110 sample tanks located in different agro-climatic conditions of Odisha and West Bengal using a structured questionnaire, focus group discussions and interactions with the stakeholders. Estimating binary logit and multivariate probit models, the authors find that households’ perception about and adaptation to climate change depend on a set of socioeconomic, demographic and institutional factors and the traditional water-harvesting structures like tanks and ponds have an important role in this regard. Nevertheless, enhancing the efficiency of tanks for resilience to climate change requires detailed scrutiny of various capitals and designing of necessary policy and institutional initiatives accordingly. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Tanika Chakraborty, Deep Mukherjee, and Sarani Saha; individual chapters, the contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109696514

Genetic differences contribute to this variation, but the neural mechanisms are not understood. Here, we dissect natural variation in the behavioral flexibility of two Caenorhabditis elegans wild strains. In one strain, a memory of exposure to 21% O2 suppresses CO2-evoked locomotory arousal; in the other, CO2 evokes arousal regardless of previous O2 experience. We map that variation to a polymorphic dendritic scaffold protein, ARCP-1, expressed in sensory neurons. ARCP-1 binds the Ca2+-dependent phosphodiesterase PDE-1 and co-localizes PDE-1 with molecular sensors for CO2 at dendritic ends. Reducing ARCP-1 or PDE-1 activity promotes CO2 escape by altering neuropeptide expression in the BAG CO2 sensors. Variation in ARCP-1 alters behavioral plasticity in multiple paradigms. Our findings are reminiscent of genetic accommodation, an evolutionary process by which phenotypic flexibility in response to environmental variation is reset by genetic change. © 2019 MRC Laboratory of Molecular BiologyIndividuals can vary in their capacity to adapt their behavior to changes in the environment.

In this study, we provide baseline estimates of seagrass extent, and soil Corg stocks and accumulation rates from different seagrass habitats at Rottnest Island (in Amphibolis spp., Posidonia spp., Halophila ovalis, and mixed Posidonia/Amphibolis spp. meadows). The Corg stocks in 0.5 m thick seagrass soil deposits, derived from 24 cores, were 5.1 ± 0.7 kg Corg m–2 (mean ± SE, ranging from 0.05 to 12.9 kg Corg m–2), accumulating at 23.2 ± 3.2 g Corg m–2 year–1 (ranging from 0.22 to 58.9 g Corg m–2 year–1) over the last decades. There were significant differences in Corg content (%) and stocks (mg Corg cm–3), stable carbon isotope composition of the soil organic matter (δ13C), and soil grain size among the seagrass meadows studied, highlighting that biotic and abiotic factors influence seagrass soil Corg storage. Mixed meadows of Posidonia/Amphibolis spp. and monospecific meadows of Posidonia spp. and Amphibolis spp. had the highest Corg stocks (ranging from 6.2 to 6.4 kg Corg m–2), while Halophila spp. meadows had the lowest Corg stocks (1.2 ± 0.6 kg Corg m–2). We estimated a total soil Corg stock of 48.1 ± 8.5 Gg Corg beneath the 755 ha of Rottnest Island’s seagrasses, and a Corg sequestration capacity of 0.81 ± 0.06 Gg Corg year–1, which is equivalent to the sequestration of ∼22% of the island’s current annual CO2 emissions. Our results contribute to the existing global dataset on seagrass soil Corg storage and show a significant potential of seagrass to sequester CO2, which are particularly relevant in the context of achieving carbon neutrality through conservation actions in environmentally-marketed, tourist destinations such as Rottnest Island. © Copyright © 2020 Bedulli, Lavery, Harvey, Duarte and Serrano.","Amphibolis; coastal vegetated ecosystems; Halophila; organic carbon; Posidonia; Rottnest Island; Western Australia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079157179

It is often considered as a delta mostly exposed to sea-level rise and exacerbated by land subsidence, even if the local vertical land movement rates remain uncertain. Here, we reconstruct the water-level (WL) changes over 1968 to 2012, using an unprecedented set of 101 water-level gauges across the delta. Over the last 45 y, WL in the delta increased slightly faster (∼3 mm/y), than global mean sea level (∼2 mm/y). However, from 2005 onward, we observe an acceleration in the WL rise in the west of the delta. The interannual WL fluctuations are strongly modulated by El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) variability, with WL lower than average by 30 to 60 cm during cooccurrent El Niño and positive IOD events and higher-thanaverage WL, by 16 to 35 cm, during La Niña years. Using satellite altimetry and WL reconstructions, we estimate that the maximum expected rates of delta subsidence during 1993 to 2012 range from 1 to 7 mm/y. By 2100, even under a greenhouse gas emission mitigation scenario (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 4.5), the subsidence could double the projected sea-level rise, making it reach 85 to 140 cm across the delta. This study provides a robust regional estimate of contemporary relative WL changes in the delta induced by continental freshwater dynamics, vertical land motion, and sea-level rise, giving a basis for developing climate mitigation strategies. © 2020 National Academy of Sciences.

This task is underpinned by the availability of accurate models of building stock from which appropriate parameters may be extracted. For example, the form of a building, such as whether it is detached, semi-detached, terraced etc. and its shape may be used as part of a typology for defining its likely energy use. When these details are combined with information on building construction materials or glazing ratio, it can be used to infer the heat transfer characteristics of different properties. However, these data are not readily available for energy modelling or urban simulation. Although this is not a problem when the geographic scope corresponds to a small area and can be hand-collected, such manual approaches cannot be easily applied at the city or national scale. In this article, we demonstrate an approach that can automatically extract this information at the city scale using off-the-shelf products supplied by a National Mapping Agency. We present two novel techniques to create this knowledge directly from input geometry. The first technique is used to identify built form based upon the physical relationships between buildings. The second technique is used to determine a more refined internal/external wall measurement and ratio. The second technique has greater metric accuracy and can also be used to address problems identified in extracting the built form. A case study is presented for the City of Nottingham in the United Kingdom using two data products provided by the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain: MasterMap and AddressBase. This is followed by a discussion of a new categorisation approach for housing form for urban energy assessment. © The Author(s) 2018.","Built environment; geographical information systems; urban form","algorithm; building construction; classification; energy use; GIS; mapping method; residential location; urban housing; urban planning; England; Nottingham [England]; Nottingham [Nottingham (ADS)]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044500905

Driven by the increased concentration of human activities in cities, occupational exposure represents one of the main risk factors to disease burden. Consequently, ‘living with’ air pollution is a significant daily life public health issue. In this study, we focus on three specific occupational sites in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire, representing different major pollution sources–road traffic, wood fires and waste-burning fires. We explore in particular the social experiences of people exposed to chronic air pollution as well as the distribution of health risks across different occupational sources. We assessed the characterization of the ‘risk culture’ of workers, studying if it varies according to participants’ occupations and how it influenced their exposure. Our analysis combines a qualitative assessment of the ‘risk culture’ of air pollution with the development of a Risk Culture Indicator (RCI). We show firstly that the working conditions and occupational practices in each group shape specific representations of air pollution, varying levels and emphasis within understandings of risk as represented within the RCI scores. We also demonstrate that occupational status in each group plays a role in reducing exposure to air pollution, with those most vulnerable socio-economically remaining the most exposed. Finally, the findings suggest that risk culture is the combination of a tangible experience of air pollution and other risks encountered in daily life, technical mediations shaping that experience (objects and equipment), as well as existing power relationships. These considerations of risk culture should be considered as an integral part in assessment of health risks. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Africa; air pollution; occupational health; risk culture; urban environment","air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; Article; daily life activity; environmental exposure; environmental health; environmental indicator; female; hazardous waste; human; human activities; male; occupational exposure; occupational hazard; qualitative analysis; risk culture; risk culture indicator; semi structured interview; social status; socioeconomics; traffic; work environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078749032

The presence and evolution of different compounds are directly affected by indoor activities, classroom materials and equipment, along with outside conditions derived from location and surrounding activities. Despite high CO2 concentration levels in classrooms being regulated in some regions, there is a wide range of pollutant substances that should be considered. This paper analyses a wide spectrum of air pollutants in school buildings to identify their relative impact and relevance. Measured values are compared to the recommended indoor air guideline values (IAGVs) reported in different national regulations and health organisations. This characterisation helps to evaluate the impact of potential indoor and outdoor air pollutant sources in schools; to define appropriate criteria to analyse the exposure to a wide range of air pollutants; and to develop appropriate strategies in order to reduce the exposure to air pollutants and minimise adverse health effects. A set of high priority pollutants, such as CO2, PM2.5, PM10, TVOC and a set of specific aldehydes and volatile organic compounds, were monitored through active and passive measurement in 18 classrooms of 9 Mediterranean schools. These schools were selected according to their construction period, design typology, and students’ ages. The measurements taken during teaching hours show mean CO2 concentration values of 1530 ppm, oscillating in a range from −24% to +31%. The analysis highlights that along with occupancy, the main indoor air pollutant sources in schools are related to settled dust that produces suspension particles during classroom activity, affecting the relative differences in the mean PM concentration value from +36% to +193%. Moreover, aldehydes show high concentration values in infant classrooms, showing relative differences in the mean value from +163% to +313%. Additionally, the study demonstrates that outdoor air pollutant sources in school surroundings, such as high-density traffic areas or industrial activities, play an important role in final indoor air quality performance, affecting PM10, PM2.5, TVOC, benzene and toluene levels. The measurements show good indoor air quality values, below the recommended indoor air quality guidelines, but they also highlight the monitoring interest of some specific compounds for future regulations, such as PM2.5, PM10, TVOC, benzene, toluene or formaldehyde. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollutants; Indoor air guideline values; Indoor air quality; Mediterranean climate; School","Air quality; Aldehydes; Benzene; Carbon dioxide; School buildings; Suspensions (fluids); Toluene; Volatile organic compounds; Air pollutants; Guideline values; Indoor air quality; Mediterranean climates; School; Indoor air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072584808

The thermal sensitivity (TS), based on relationship between air temperature (Ta) and Tw, of a given stream can be used for quantifying the streams sensitivity to future climate change. This study aims to compare TS for a wide range of temperate streams located within a large French catchment (110,000 km2) using 4 years of hourly data (2008–2012) and to cluster stations sharing similar thermal variabilities and thereby identify environmental key drivers that modify TS at the regional scale. Two successive classifications were carried out: (a) first based on Ta–Tw relationship metrics including TS and (b) second to establish a link between a selection of environmental variables and clusters of stations. Based on weekly Ta–Tw relationships, the first classification identified four thermal regimes with differing annual Tw in terms of magnitude and amplitudes in comparison with Ta. The second classification, based on classification and regression tree method, succeeded to link each thermal regime to different environmental controlling factors. Streams influenced by both groundwater inflows and shading are the most moderated with the lowest TS and an annual amplitude of Tw around half of the annual amplitude of Ta. Inversely, stations located on large streams with a high distance from source and not (or slightly) influenced by groundwater inflows nor shading showed the highest TS, and so, they are very climate sensitive. These findings have implications for guiding river basin managers and other stakeholders in implementing thermal moderation measures in the context of a warming climate and global change. © 2019 The Authors.

Aiming to initiate a climate-centered dialogue, a hybrid team of scientists and artists collected local narratives within the Kerourien neighbourhood, in the city of Brest in Brittany, France. Kerourien is a place known for its stigmatizing crime, poverty, marginalization and state of disrepair. Social work is higher on the agenda than climate action. The team thus acknowledged that local narratives might not make much mention of climate change, and recognized part of the work might be to shift awareness to the actual or potential, current or future, connections between everyday non-climate concerns and climate issues. Such a shift called for a practical intervention, centered on local culture. The narrative collection process was dovetailed with preparing the neighbourhood's 50th anniversary celebration and establishing a series of art performances to celebrate the neighbourhood and its residents. Non-climate and quasi-climate stories were collected, documented, and turned into art forms. The elements of climate service co-production in this process are twofold. First, they point to the ways in which non-climate change related local concerns may be mapped out in relation to climate change adaptation, showing how non-climate change concerns call for climate information. Secondly, they show how the co-production of climate services may go beyond the provision of climate information by generating procedural benefits such as local empowerment – thus generating capacities that may be mobilized to face climate change. We conclude by stressing that “place-based climate service co-production for action” may require questioning the nature of the “services” rendered, questioning the nature of “place,” and questioning what “action” entails. We offer leads for addressing these questions in ways that help realise empowerment and greater social justice. © 2020 The Authors","Arts and Sciences; Brittany; Climate services; Co-production; Narrative; Transdisciplinary",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094624992

Recently detected flaring activity of H2O maser in the massive star-forming region G25.65+1.05 gave us a unique opportunity to study the fine structure of H2O maser emission in the bursting state with extremely high space VLBI angular resolution. Observation of the source was carried out with ∼9 Earth diameter space-ground baseline within the framework of the RadioAstron project. H2O maser emission from two spectral features, including the bursting one, was detected in the experiment. Only ∼1% of the bursting H2O maser emission was detected on the space-ground baselines: it indicates the presence of a very compact spatial structure with a size of ∼25 μas, which corresponds to 0.05 AU or ∼5 solar diameters at the distance to the source of 2.08 kpc, and the brightness temperature of ∼3 × 1016 K. Analysis of the flux density as a function of the baseline length for the bursting H2O maser feature in the source shows that most of the emission comes from an extended “halo” structure, while the core of emission is very compact and has an extreme brightness temperature. These results are in agreement with the model of interacting maser clouds considered as the likely explanation of the nature of the burst in the source. Under the assumption of such a model, the beam size of maser emission is reduced while the brightness temperatures similar to the highest observed values are produced. © 2019 COSPAR","Instrumentation: high angular resolution; Masers; Stars: formation","Earth (planet); Feature extraction; Luminance; Stars; Temperature; Angular resolution; Brightness temperatures; Compact structures; Flaring activity; Instrumentation:high angular resolution; Spatial structure; Spectral feature; Stars: formation; Masers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063335706

We report on global, national, and city-level trends since 1975 in the street-network disconnectedness index (SNDi), based on every mapped node and edge in the world. Streets in new developments in 90% of the 134 most populous countries have become less connected since 1975, while just 29% show an improving trend since 2000. The same period saw a near doubling in the relative frequency of a street-network type characterized by high circuity, typical of gated communities. We identify persistence in street-network sprawl, indicative of path-dependent processes. Specifically, cities and countries with low connectivity in recent years also had relatively low preexisting connectivity in our earliest time period.

Given the social contribution of this crop in the cropping areas of Colombia, it is necessary to develop agronomic management strategies that contribute to increasing productivity and offering alternatives that regulate the effects of climate seasonality on banana production in the Urabá region of Colombia. For this purpose, different planting densities (2,000, 2,500, 3,000 and 3,500 plants ha-1) and planting arrangements (triangle, rectangle and double furrow), plus a relative control (1,700 plants ha-1 under triangle arrangement), were evaluated in the banana cv. Williams. The experimental design corresponded to randomized complete blocks in a 4 x 3 + 1 (densities x arrangements + control treatment at 1,700 plants ha-1) factorial arrangement. During harvest, the following parameters were monitored: bunch weight, number of hands and fingers per bunch, finger length and diameter, bunch ratio and percentage of loss per bunch. Two analyses of variance were carried out, a general one including the control treatment, and an additional one excluding it. The double furrow planting arrangement favored the productivity of the crop in terms of a greater assimilation and lesser loss records at the bunch level. The strong correlation of the studied variables with the double furrow arrangement became evident. © 2020 Universidad Nacional de Colombia.

P2H promotes the integration of electricity from renewable energy sources into the power grid by utilizing otherwise unused electricity (excess energy) for space heating. To estimate the contribution of this effect from a techno-economic perspective, a linear problem is defined by minimizing the overall heating costs and solved by an open source model generator. Four different scenarios are modeled on a city level, using real heat demand data from a case study regarding the municipality of Greifswald, a region with dominant wind-energy. Results indicate that district heating networks are an important technology for coupling power and heat to meet CO2 reduction targets.

The adoption of emission standards for the heavy duty industry was initially launched by the United States, followed by the European Union and Japan, and, subsequently, by other countries, like Australia, Brazil, China and India, among others, generally with a time lag. This continuous ""cleaning"" effort has led to the current rigorous emission limits-materialized by the so called U.S. EPA 2010 and Euro VI and their foreign variants-which have provided huge emissions reductions (HC, CO, NOx, PM and smoke and, more recently, CO2). Nevertheless, due to air quality and global climate change concerns (basically derived from the air quality non compliance, associated with cities' pollution hotspots, as well as greenhouse gas emissions) there is still a regulatory demand for further emissions control improvement. In this scenario, the heavy duty vehicle industry has pursued not only increasingly stringent emission targets, as well as the compliance of emission performance throughout the vehicle lifecycle, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) control, as well as the compatibility with alternative fuels (biodiesel, renewable diesel, biogas, etc.). In this context, governments and HDV industry are currently engaged in an effort to develop an important step in the improvement of worldwide standardized HDV emission limits. This work is supposed to present an overview of HDV emission control technologies, associated with the evolution of emission standards, with an emphasis on the in-use performance and its intrinsic emission trade-offs, as well as the inherent required infrastructure (fuel quality and additive requirement/availability), followed by a summary of some countries' cleaning implementation pathways, associated with both fleet renewal and retrofit of current fleets. Lastly, the work presents a snapshot of the strategies and the technological pathways for further improvements on emission standards. © 2019 SAE International.

Urban vegetation provides numerous ecosystem services on a local scale and is therefore a potential adaptation strategy that can be used in an era of global warming to offset the increasing impacts of human activity on urban environments. In this study, we propose a set of urban green ecological metrics that can be used to evaluate urban green ecosystem services. The metrics were derived from two complementary surveys: a traditional remote sensing survey of multispectral images and Laser Imaging Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data, and a survey using proximate sensing through images made available by the Google Street View database. In accordance with previous studies, two classes of metrics were calculated: greenery at lower and higher elevations than building facades. In the last phase of the work, the metrics were applied to city blocks, and a spatially constrained clustering methodology was employed. Homogeneous areas were identified in relation to the urban greenery characteristics. The proposed methodology represents the development of a geographic information system that can be used by public administrators and urban green designers to create and maintain urban public forests. © 2020 by the authors.","Aerial images; Convolutional neural network (CNN); Landscape metrics; LiDAR; Semantic segmentation; Spatial clustering; Street view images; Urban forest","Convolutional neural networks; Forestry; Global warming; Image segmentation; Optical radar; Remote sensing; Semantics; Surveys; Aerial images; Landscape metrics; Semantic segmentation; Spatial clustering; Urban forests; Ecosystems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081080152

The present study aimed to implement results of an extant dynamic, mechanistic Tier 3 model for enteric methane (CH4) (applied in Dutch national GHG inventory) in order to capture variation in enteric CH4 emission, and in faecal N and organic matter (OM) digestibility, ultimately required to predict manure CH4 and ammonia emission. Tier 3 model predictions were translated into calculation rules that could easily be implemented in an annual nutrient cycling assessment tool including GHG emissions, which is currently used by Dutch dairy farmers. Calculations focussed on (1) enteric CH4 emission, (2) apparent faecal OM digestibility and (3) apparent faecal N digestibility. Enteric CH4 was expressed in CH4 yield indicated with the term emission factor (EF; g CH4/kg DM) for individual dietary components and feedstuffs. Factors investigated to cover predicted variation in EF value included the level of feed intake, the type of roughage fed (proportions of grass silage and maize silage) and the quality of roughage fed. A minimum number of three classes of roughage type (i.e. 0. 40% and 80% maize silage in roughage DM) appeared necessary to obtain correspondence between interpolated EF values from EF lists and Tier 3 model predictions. A linear decline in EF value with 1% per kg increase in DM intake is adopted based on model simulations. The quality of roughage was represented by the effect of maturity of harvested grass or of the whole plant maize at cutting, based on a survey of modelling as well as experimental work. Also, predictions were assembled for apparent faecal OM digestibility which could be used in national inventory and in farm accounting. Apparent faecal N digestibility (as a major determinant of predicted urinary N excretion) was predicted, to support current Dutch national ammonia emission inventory and to correct the level of N digestibility in farm accounting. Compared to generic values or values retrieved from the Dutch feeding tables, predicted OM and N digestibility and enteric CH4 are better rooted in physiological principles and better reflect observed variation under experimental conditions. The present results apply for conditions with fairly intensive grassland management in temperate regions. © 2020 The Animal Consortium","digestibility; enteric methane; farm accounting; nitrogen; Tier 3","methane; nitrogen; animal; bovine; chemistry; diet; digestion; female; fermentation; lactation; maize; metabolism; milk; rumen; silage; veterinary medicine; Animals; Cattle; Diet; Digestion; Female; Fermentation; Lactation; Methane; Milk; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Rumen; Silage; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087755109

For this reason, regulators and researchers have widely recognized the necessity to put cities, as an important object of assessment, and city authorities, as an important actor group, at the core of climate mitigation efforts. In their pursuit of a low-emission future, however, cities are confronted with a number of theoretical and practical questions regarding allocation and accounting of city-related greenhouse gas (GHG), target setting and subsequent planning for mitigation. A wide literature is currently focused on the first two. However, to achieve ambitious climate targets, research should urgently focus more on how to reap all available urban mitigation actions and encourage rapid and radical changes. Identifying and prioritising mitigation strategies and actions to achieve the targets, as well as putting them together into a coherent plan with a clear vision of the future, are critical steps in actionable and effective climate action planning. As a first contribution in this direction, this paper provides recommendations for research and practice to support a more integrated and conscious definition and prioritization of actions by municipal stakeholders, based on: (1) the specific context of each city type as a determinant of what actions may work, (2) the executive power of city authority to act as the main actor and (3) the multiple benefits and/or trade-offs accruing from each local climate action. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Economic and social effects; Economics; Gas emissions; Global warming; Sustainable development; Action planning; Climate mitigations; Climate targets; Greenhouse gas (GHG); Human economics; Important object; Minimize greenhouse gas emissions; Mitigation strategy; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079655884

Our conceptual tool is designed to support policy makers to manage five selected soil functions and demands: productivity, water availability, nutrients, carbon sequestration, biodiversity. We applied it to Amazon's Agricultural frontier - the Upper Xingu River Basin, state of Mato Grosso, Brazil – one of the most rapidly changing regions in the basin. In this study we implemented an interdisciplinary, GIS-based, multi-model approach to understand how land use change due to agricultural expansion and intensification is affecting soil functions at the Amazon's Arc of Deforestation. Encompassing two large Brazilian Biomes, the tropical rain forest and the Cerrado (Brazilian Savannas), the study area of ~170.000km2 has undergone extensive changes in land use and land cover since the late 1970s. In only 40 years, the basin has already lost 30% of its natural vegetation, which was replaced mainly by pastures for cattle ranching. Since the early 2000s, a new cycle has started and currently the Upper Xingu River Basin is undergoing an increased agriculture intensification process (e.g., double cropping) to produce corn and soy bean for the international market. According to stakeholders, the main limiting factor for agriculture is infrastructure and absence of government. The lack of support affects markets and international trading with high costs for stocking and distribution of soy bean products. As proxies for soil indicator for supply we used a 2015 land use map derived from remote sensing data. Demand was expressed as annual productivity (kg/ha/y) from census data spatialized by land use type. Evapotranspiration was used as the proxy for water availability and water yield for demands. For a biodiversity indicator we used Indigenous Land and Conservation Units as suppliers and Legal Reserve and Permanent Protection Areas as demand (legal instruments). Nutrient Cycling supply was mapped based on a base saturation of 0-30 cm of almost 400 soil profiles and demand was mapped using average fertilizer application (NPK) spatialized by land use. Carbon storage and sequestration were derived from field measurements spatialized by land use and demands were generated using field carbon sequestration measurements and policy (Zero illegal deforestation target). Our results show that this approach can be applied to a range of landscapes and is a useful tool for decision making and policy implementation and support. © 2020 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Building on social psychology research showing the importance of seeing one's group as moral, one reason people act on climate change is to help create a more moral and caring society. Considering climate change action through this lens gives rise to several challenges, including how people respond to moral threats, who has moral standing as advocates, the consequences of promoting a moral cause through “immoral” actions (e.g., breaking the law), and moral “blind spots” where some emitting behaviors are excluded from scrutiny. Reviewing social psychological bases for these issues suggests potential responses to these challenges, including the importance of engaging people with diverse views and backgrounds (e.g., through citizens' assemblies), advisory personal carbon budgets, and broad-based policies that aim to secure the social well-being of communities as well as the protect the environment (e.g., a Green New Deal).

The results are as follows: (1) The spatial association of China's provincial transportation carbon emissions exhibits an intuitive network structure. The degree of closeness which were 0.2253 and 0.2333 in 2005 and 2015 respectively shows an increasing trend on the whole. However, it hit the bottom in 2011, reaching a minimum of 0.2230, which is the “low closeness degree inflection point”. (2) The spatial association network presents a significant “core-edge” distribution pattern. Specifically, in the central and eastern regions of China, Henan and Jiangsu have degrees of up to 58.621 and 44.828, which are at the network center. However, some remote regions, like Jilin and Hainan, have degrees of less than 20.000, which are marginalized. (3) The geographical adjacency, the expansion of the difference in R&D investment, and the narrowing of the difference in economic development promote the formation of the interprovincial spatial association. Therefore, in the process of controlling carbon emissions from transportation, the government should focus on the provinces at the network center and pay attention to the impact of the R&D investment on the spatial association of transportation carbon emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Quadratic assignment procedure; Social network analysis; Transportation carbon emission network; “Core-edge” structure","carbon; natural gas; petroleum; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic development; environmental economics; network design; social network; spatial analysis; state role; transportation infrastructure; trend analysis; air pollution control; analytic method; Article; carbon footprint; driving ability; economic development; energy consumption; environmental policy; government; gravity; gravity model; human; protest; spatial association network analysis; traffic and transport; China; exhaust gas; China; Hainan; Henan; Jiangsu; Jilin; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073993451

It was found that the mean PM2.5 concentration in the SMA was 33.7 μg/m3, while inorganic ions accounted for 53% of the total mass concentration. The component ratio of inorganic ions increased by up to 61%-63% as the daily mean PM2.5 concentration increased. In spring, nitrate was the dominant component of PM2.5, accounting for 17%-32% of the monthly mean PM2.5 concentrations. In order to quantify the impact of long-range transport on the SMA PM2.5, a set of sensitivity simulations with the community multiscale air-quality model was performed. Results show that the annual averaged impact of Chinese emissions on SMA PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 41% to 44% during the five years. Chinese emissions' impact on SMA nitrate ranged from 50% (winter) to 67% (spring). This result exhibits that reductions in SO2 and NOX emissions are crucial to alleviate the PM2.5 concentration. It is expected that NOX emission reduction efforts in China will help decrease PM2.5 concentrations in the SMA. © 2020 by the authors.","Chemical composition; Long-range transport; Nitrate; PM2.5; SMA; Sulfate","Air quality; Emission control; Nitrates; Organic carbon; Springs (components); Sulfur compounds; Chemical component; Chemical constituents; Community multi-scale air quality models; Emissions' impacts; Long range transport; PM2.5 concentration; Sensitivity Simulation; Seoul metropolitan area; Chemical analysis; air quality; concentration (composition); long range transport; metropolitan area; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; reduction; seasonal variation; sulfur dioxide; China; Seoul [Seoul (ADS)]; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081158086

A detailed agroecological examination of all components of the natural-territorial complex, the creation of simulation models of their dynamics and the adoption of optimal decisions based on the results of forecasts should be carried out. The purpose of landscape analysis of natural resources is a comprehensive assessment of climatic, soil, plant and animal factors, establishing the relationship of landscape components with farming systems. Any landscape in the process of its development is exposed to impacts, and its stability has its limits. The stability threshold, expressed through the preservation by the landscape of its parameters and properties, and the critical impact quantities are determined in each case. General criteria for the natural stability of geosystems are their high organization, intensive functioning and geosystems functions balance, including biological productivity and renewability of vegetation cover. These qualities are determined by the optimum ratio of heat and moisture and are expressed by the development of soil cover, and ultimately, soil fertility. Landscape-ecological analysis of the territory makes it possible to establish the composition of agricultural and non-agricultural land, taking into account the heterogeneity and stability of a particular landscape, the occurrence of geochemical and biological processes in it, as well as to link the system of agriculture, land reclamation and specialization of the agricultural organization. The main element of Novosyolovo district landscape is agricultural land; the lands of the forest fund are the second largest area of natural geosystems.

To evaluate this influence, tree growth along the temperature gradients can be investigated on various organization levels, beginning from detailed climatic records in xylem cells’ number and morphometric parameters. In this study, the Borus Ridge of the Western Sayan Mountains (South Siberia) was considered as a forest area under rapid climate change caused by massive Sayano-Shushenskoe reservoir. Several parameters of the xylem anatomical structure in Siberian spruce (Picea obovata Ledeb.) were derived from normalized tracheidograms of cell radial diameter and cell wall thickness and analyzed during 50 years across elevational gradient (at 520, 960, and 1320 m a.s.l.). On the regional scale, the main warming by 0.42°C per decade occurs during cold period (November–March). Construction of the reservoir accelerated local warming substantially since 1980, when abrupt shift of the cold season temperature by 2.6°C occurred. It led to the vegetation season beginning 3–6 days earlier and ending 4–10 day later with more stable summer heat supply. Two spatial patterns were found in climatic response of maximal cell wall thickness: (1) temperature has maximal impact during 21-day period, and its seasonality shifts with elevation in tune with temperature gradient; (2) response to the date of temperature passing +9.5°C threshold is observed at two higher sites. Climate change yielded significantly bigger early wood spruce tracheids at all sites, but its impact on cell wall deposition process had elevational gradient: maximal wall thickness increased by 7.9% at the treeline, by 18.2% mid-range, and decreased by 4.9% at the lower boundary of spruce growth; normalized total cell wall area increased by 6.2%–6.8% at two higher sites but remained stable at the lowest one. We believe that these patterns are caused by two mechanisms of spruce secondary growth cessation: “emergency” induced by temperature drop versus “regular” one in warmer conditions. Therefore, autumn lengthening of growth season stimulated wood matter accumulation in tracheid walls mainly in cold environment, increasing role of boreal and mountain forests in carbon cycle. © 2020, Science Press, Institute of Mountain Hazards and Environment, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Climate-growth relationship; Elevational gradient; Picea obovata; Quantitative wood anatomy; Sayano-Shushenskoe Reservoir","carbon cycle; climate change; growth response; quantitative analysis; terrestrial ecosystem; wall; warming; wood; Sayan Mountains; Picea; Picea obovata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078569317

While reforestation efforts in nontropical systems are incorporating drought-adapted genotypes into restoration programs to cope with drier conditions, such approaches have not been tested or implemented in tropical forests. As the first effort to examine genetic variation in plant response to drought in a tropical wet forest, we established a watering experiment using five replicated maternal lines (i.e. seedlings from different maternal trees) of five dipterocarp species native to Borneo. Apart from the expected species level variation in growth and herbivory (3-fold variation in both cases), we also found intraspecific variation so that growth in some cases varied 2-fold, and herbivory 3-fold, among genetically different maternal lines. In two species we found that among-maternal line variation in growth rate was negatively correlated with tolerance to water limitation, that is, the maternal lines that performed the best in the high water treatment lost proportionally more of their growth during water limitation. We argue that selection for tolerance to future drier conditions is not only likely to impact population genetics of entire forests, but likely extends from forest trees to the communities of canopy arthropods associated with these trees. In tropical reforestation efforts where increased drought is predicted from climate change, including plant material resilient to drier conditions may improve restoration effectiveness. © 2019 Society for Ecological Restoration","climate change; Dipterocarpaceae; drought tolerance; genetic variation; herbivory; reforestation; tropical forest restoration","climate change; drought; forest resource; genetic variation; herbivory; population genetics; reforestation; restoration ecology; tropical forest; Borneo; Arthropoda; Dipterocarpaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074346090

Results, analysed with SPSS and NVivo, show that community engagement in project interventions is significantly influenced by the perceptions that REDD+ will promote local community development and generate individual income. Although most community members do not know how forest revenues are presently distributed (no transparency) they are expecting more developmental projects and employment. It is belief that, there will be greater transparency in future REDD+ benefits because present benefits earned from the Ministry of Forestry and Fauna for participating in the present conservation initiative are unclear and negligible.

In the present study, the EPEs are defined by applying a non-parametric (95th percentile) approach over different climatic regions of Saudi Arabia using observed daily precipitation data for the period 1984–2016 obtained from 27 meteorological stations. The frequency, composite and correlation analyses are performed to evaluate the statistics of EPEs and their teleconnections. During the wet season (Nov-Apr), the frequency of the EPEs (≥25 mm/day) are higher over northeastern, central and southwestern coastal parts of Saudi Arabia. The composites and correlation analyses show that the EPEs over Saudi Arabia are associated with mid-latitude circumglobal wave train (CGT), which evolves a few days before the onset of EPEs and decays afterwards. The CGT modulates the upper-level trough over the Arabian Peninsula (AP) along with the surface anomalous low-pressure system that enhances moisture convergence, favoring the occurrence of EPEs over the region. The EPEs over Saudi Arabia are also associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which shows that during the positive (negative) ENSO phase the frequency of EPEs increases (decreases) over the country. Moreover, the El Niño (with positive CGT) enhances the EPEs frequency over Saudi Arabia while vice-versa happens for La Niña (with negative CGT) phase. © 2019","Arabian Peninsula; CGT; ENSO; Extreme precipitation events (EPEs); Saudi Arabia","Atmospheric pressure; Climatology; Correlation methods; Water management; Arabian Peninsula; Correlation analysis; Daily precipitations; ENSO; Extreme precipitation events; Meteorological station; Saudi Arabia; Waterresource management; Precipitation (meteorology); atmospheric moisture; correlation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; La Nina; precipitation assessment; teleconnection; wet season; Arabian Peninsula; Saudi Arabia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070969052

In this article, we study the multi-facility green Weber problem (MF-GWP), an extension of the classical multi-facility Weber problem, that considers environmental concerns in a distribution system in the context of a planar facility location problem. In the MF-GWP, the vehicles are sent directly from the facilities to the assigned customers to satisfy their demands. Each customer has a deadline and the vehicles serving the customer must arrive at the location of the customer no later than the deadline. The MF-GWP determines the locations of p facilities on the plane, p &gt; 1, allocations of customers to the facilities, and the speeds of the distribution vehicles so as to minimize the total amount of CO2 emission in the distribution system. We formulate this problem as a mixed integer second order cone programming (MISOCP) problem. This formulation turns out to be weak and therefore only small size instances can be solved to optimality within four hours. For larger size instances, a local search heuristic is proposed and some well-known heuristics developed for the multi-facility Weber problem, namely “location-allocation”, “transfer follow-up”, and “decomposition” are adapted for the MF-GWP. We use second order cone programming (SOCP) and the proposed MISOCP formulation as subproblems within the heuristics. We provide our computational experiments to compare the proposed solution methods in terms of solution quality and time. The results show that within a fixed computational time, even though the location-allocation heuristic is able to make more replications, the improvement heuristics considered, i.e., transfer or transfer followed by decomposition, usually find better solutions while using less number of replications. We also investigate how the total amount of CO2 emitted by distribution vehicles changes with respect to the number of facilities located. We argue that in several real life applications from different sectors including aviation and robotics, MF-GWP and its extensions or modifications can be used to reduce the CO2 emission or energy consumption. As an illustrative example, we show the applicability of the MF-GWP within an assembly line system, where the stations are fed by dedicated rail-guided vehicles. © 2019","CO2 Emission; Continuous location; Matheuristics; Nonlinear optimization; Sustainability; Transportation","Carbon dioxide; Energy utilization; Heuristic algorithms; Integer programming; Location; Nonlinear programming; Sales; Sustainable development; Transportation; Vehicles; CO2 emissions; Computational experiment; Continuous locations; Facility location problem; Local search heuristics; Matheuristics; Non-linear optimization; Second-order cone programming; Customer satisfaction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071781862

First, a bibliometric analysis was carried out to obtain a broad overview of the topic of interest. Subsequently, the most influential contributions were analysed in depth, with reference to the following two areas: supply chain and logistics; road traffic management and smart cities. The most important result is that the blockchain technology is still in an early stage, but appears extremely promising, given its possible applications within multiple fields, such as food track and trace, regulatory compliance, smart vehicles' security, and supply-demand matching. Much effort is still necessary for reaching the maturation stage because several models have been theorized in recent years, but very few have been implemented within real contexts. Moreover, the link blockchain-sustainability was explored, showing that this technology could be the trigger for limiting food waste, reducing exhaust gas emissions, favouring correct urban development, and, in general, improving quality of life. © 2019 by the authors.","Blockchain; Literature review; Logistics; Supply chain; Transportation","Gas emissions; Highway planning; Logistics; Regulatory compliance; Street traffic control; Supply chains; Transportation; Urban growth; Bibliometric analysis; Literature reviews; Maturation stage; Possible futures; Quality of life; Road traffic management; Track and Trace; Urban development; Blockchain",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079041784

Educational buildings are one of the places where future taxpayers spend a lot of time. This paper aims to study an alternative solution on how to reduce energy efficiency - indoor air quality dilemma in educational buildings by adopting systems that use renewable energy sources. A typical education building in Latvia is taken as a case study by changing it from a consumer to prosumer. This building type has a specific electricity usage profile that makes the choice of photovoltaics (PV) power quite challenging so the various power options have been analysed and used for an electricity solution. Also, the more decentralised preference is chosen - disconnect from a public heating provider and using a local system with a pellet boiler. Educational buildings using PV can reduce the electricity tariff, but the payback periods are still not very satisfactory without subsidies. The average electricity tariff per month varies between scenarios and the best one is for the scenario with 30 kW installed power. The educational building partly using 16 kW PV system reduces not only its bill for electricity but also reduces CO2 emissions by around 36 tons. The education buildings as energy prosumers using renewable energy sources are reducing GHG emissions by having high indoor air quality. © 2020 Liva Asere et al., published by Sciendo.","educational buildings; energy efficiency; GHG emissions; indoor air quality; prosumers; renewable energy sources","air quality; alternative energy; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy efficiency; indoor air; numerical model; photovoltaic system; power generation; renewable resource; Latvia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087550781

S-AOM is estimated to oxidize 90% of the methane produced in marine sediments and is mediated by a consortium of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate reducing bacteria. An additional methane sink, i.e., iron oxide coupled AOM (Fe-AOM), has been suggested to be active in the methanic zone of marine sediments. Geochemical signatures below the SMT such as high dissolved iron, low to undetectable sulfate and high methane concentrations, together with the presence of iron oxides are taken as prerequisites for this process. So far, Fe-AOM has neither been proven in marine sediments nor have the governing key microorganisms been identified. Here, using a multidisciplinary approach, we show that Fe-AOM occurs in iron oxide-rich methanic sediments of the Helgoland Mud Area (North Sea). When sulfate reduction was inhibited, different iron oxides facilitated AOM in long-term sediment slurry incubations but manganese oxide did not. Especially magnetite triggered substantial Fe-AOM activity and caused an enrichment of ANME-2a archaea. Methane oxidation rates of 0.095 ± 0.03 nmol cm–3 d–1 attributable to Fe-AOM were obtained in short-term radiotracer experiments. The decoupling of AOM from sulfate reduction in the methanic zone further corroborated that AOM was iron oxide-driven below the SMT. Thus, our findings prove that Fe-AOM occurs in methanic marine sediments containing mineral-bound ferric iron and is a previously overlooked but likely important component in the global methane budget. This process has the potential to sustain microbial life in the deep biosphere. © Copyright © 2020 Aromokeye, Kulkarni, Elvert, Wegener, Henkel, Coffinet, Eickhorst, Oni, Richter-Heitmann, Schnakenberg, Taubner, Wunder, Yin, Zhu, Hinrichs, Kasten and Friedrich.","anaerobic methanotrophs; anaerobic oxidation of methane; ANME-2a; iron oxides; marine sediment; microbial community analysis; radiotracer; stable isotope probing","iron; iron oxide; methane; stable isotope; sulfate; anaerobic metabolism; archaeon; Article; geochemical analysis; incubation time; marine environment; microbial metabolism; molecular biology; nonhuman; North Sea; reduction (chemistry); sediment; sedimentation rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078852966

We propose that niche construction mechanisms based on positive plant–soil feedback (PSF) could influence the evolution of tannin production. By modelling the flow of nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) through plants and soil in a spatially explicit context, we explored the relative contribution of herbivory and positive PSF as drivers of tannin evolution. We assumed soil N to be contained in labile and recalcitrant compartments, the latter made of tannin–protein complexes from which plants can absorb nutrients via associations with mycorrhizal fungi. In infertile environments and for plants with low biomass turnover rates, we show that when tannins modify soil properties locally, positive PSF alone can drive their evolution. We further predict the existence of positive coevolutionary feedback between associations with mycorrhizal fungi with a decaying ability and tannins, possibly triggered by the evolution of the latter as protection against herbivores. In line with our theoretical results, empirical evidence suggest that tannins are mostly present in plants with low tissue turnover, associated with mycorrhizal fungi able to decay organic matter and inhabiting infertile environments. Synthesis. Our model proposes that the evolution of tannin production can be triggered by positive plant–soil feedback, provided that tannins promote the local N retention and that mycorrhizal fungi associated with plants are able to absorb N from tannin–protein complexes. In our model, tannin production evolves only in infertile ecosystems, in agreement with field observations. Our findings highlight that the strength of niche construction depends on the ecological context, hence that global ecological properties constrain local eco-evolutionary dynamics. © 2019 The Authors.

In order to do so, cities should establish an effective climate policy which requires, as a first step, a complete greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions inventory. The accurate city-scale GHG inventory enables cities to develop, implement and track climate solution measures, mainly those related to transportation. The compilation of a city-scale GHG inventory requires a standardized method and up-to-date activity data. This systematic review critically examines 40 articles over the past 20 years to (1) identify city-scale GHG inventory methods being applied worldwide, (2) evaluate how these methods are evolving, (3) elaborate how emissions from transport sector are being estimated, and (4) determine what data types and sources of transport-related data are being used. The review was limited to articles that addressed the process of compilation of a GHG inventory. The results demonstrate that city-scale GHG inventory methods evolved from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Guidelines to a variety of GHG accounting methods that offer levels of complexity to estimate city-scale emissions. Although GHG inventory methods for city-scale have advanced over the years, almost one third of the articles reviewed were focused on the proposal of a GHG inventory framework, adjusting current methods to each city's reality or proposing new ones. The majority of the cities analysed lack local transport-related data to measure GHG emissions based on the bottom-up approach. Yet, more than 40% of the articles managed to deliver the bottom-up inventory using a diversity of data types and sources. This review shows that there is still a path to achieve a globally compatible method. This would require a joint effort between researchers and city authorities to make international protocols more compliant to each city's data availability along with the improvement of cities data collection. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Cities; Climate change; CO2 emissions; GHG inventory methods; Transport sector; Transport-related data","Climate change; Gas emissions; Cities; CO2 emissions; GHG inventory methods; Transport sectors; Transport-related data; Greenhouse gases; bottom-up approach; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; data set; emission inventory; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; urban area",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074795281

The emissions of black carbon (BC) with the other air pollutants (CO2, CH4, N2O, HFC, PFC, and SF6), is taking considerable attention in the world because of its ability to effect air quality and weather. The Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) region has been considered as one of the greatest source of emissions in India. The short lived climate pollutants (SLCPs) like BC, methane, tropospheric ozone and hydrofluorocarbons have been considered as a climate forcing agent along with CO2. These pollutants have shorter lifetime in atmosphere compared to CO2 and account for the 40–45% of global warming. Among them, BC has a great global warming ability and can increase the Earth's temperature much quicker than carbon dioxide. After CO2, the second highest donors to global warming are CH4 and BC. Recognising the importance of these pollutants, daily concentrations of BC, PM2.5 and PM10 were monitored in three district of IGP during January 2015 to December 2016. The GAINS model was used for assessment of pollution effects, emissions of SLCPs, GHGs and identifying appropriate control actions. The outcomes of modelling advocate that low carbon strategies are more competent to reduce emissions as compared to other control strategies. But, application of low carbon strategies would be restricted by the accessibility of clean fuels. In some cases, finance will be needed to support monitoring of air pollution and other supportive technologies. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Black carbon; ECLIPSE; Forest fire; GAINS model; GHGs; SLCPs; Thermal power plant","Agricultural wastes; Air quality; Brickmaking; Carbon dioxide; Deforestation; Fluorocarbons; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Pollution control; Thermal pollution; Thermoelectric power plants; Black carbon; ECLIPSE; Forest fires; GHGs; SLCPs; Thermal power plants; Pollution detection; ammonia; black carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; fluorinated hydrocarbon; methane; nitrogen oxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; emission control; forest fire; greenhouse gas; modeling; pollutant; thermal power; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; climate; concentration (parameter); control strategy; controlled study; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; health impact assessment; particulate matter; priority journal; Gangetic Plain; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072172233

Until now, no information is given about the light output of any TBPs and the question “Are the TBPs capable of producing the necessary lighting levels for exterior lighting?” is unanswered. For this reason, a new methodology is proposed for selecting and analyzing the lighting output potential of transgenic plants ted for specific climatic conditions. This methodology considers growth and reduction factors, as well as a formulae for estimating the plants’ luminous output by performing light measurements. Results show that transgenic plants in medium growth can emit a median luminous flux of up to 57 lm, a value that can definitely support low lighting requirements when used in large numbers of plants. From the lighting measurements and calculations performed in this research, the light output of the TBPs for a typical road with 5m width was found equal to 2lx. The amount of plants required was 40 at each side of the road for every 30m of streets with P6 road class. The results show that the use of bioluminescent plants can actually contribute to the reduction of energy consumption, concerning only the lighting criterium, thus creating an enormous opportunity for a new state-of- the-art market and research that could potentially minimize CO2 emissions and light pollution, improve urban and suburban microclimate, mitigate the effects of climate change, as well as provide an alternative means of lighting affecting both outdoor lighting design and landscape planning in suburban and urban settings. Moreover, further research should be applied considering also other possible ecological impacts before applying TBPs for exterior lighting applications. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bio-luminescence; Electrical energy saving; Energy efficient exterior light; Public lighting; Sustainable landscape; Urban greening","Bioluminescence; Climate change; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Light; Plants (botany); Pollution; Roads and streets; Electrical energy savings; Energy efficient; Public lighting; Sustainable landscape; Urban greening; Lighting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072741267

Based on this fact, this document evaluates the revenue potential of an international tax on crude oil to finance programs to mitigate climate change. For this purpose, a dynamic, general equilibrium model for the world economy with two regions is proposed. One region is a net importer of oil, while the other is an exporter. In the model, oil exports are subject to a permanent per-barrel tax. Short- and long-run revenue projections are offered under alternative assumptions. Some exercises suggest that the resources generated from a $5 per-barrel tax on 25% of world oil exports would amount to $18.4 billion dollars in the initial year. To implement such policy at the international level, an “Oil and Climate Club” is proposed, where revenues from oil taxation would be allocated to funding environment-friendly programs. The paper includes a discussion on how to make the club's rules consistent with international trade laws. © 2019 The Author","Climate change; Climate clubs; Crude oil; Green climate fund; Taxes","Crude oil; International trade; Taxation; Climate clubs; Environment friendly; Finance programs; General equilibrium models; Global cooperation; Green climate fund; International trade law; Revenue potential; Climate change; climate change; crude oil; environmental economics; environmental tax; policy implementation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073316645

Design/methodology/approach: For this purpose, the time series, data technique is applied. Unit root test with structural break and the bounds testing approach for cointegration in the presence of structural break is tested. Finally, a vector error correction model for the Granger causality test is applied to detect the direction of causality. The authors have used the techniques that will help in examining the structural break in the time series data. Findings: The results reveal that their exists a long-run relationship between CO2 emissions and its determinants in the USA, Canada, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UK, Australia, Italy, France and Spain, energy consumption is the main determinant of carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in the long run and for direction of causality, the authors found bidirectional causality in the long run between energy consumption and CO2 emissions in the USA, Canada, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the UK, and Granger causality running in opposite direction in the case of Australia from CO2 emissions to energy consumption was analyzed. In terms of growth-trade-pollution nexus (USA, Canada, Iran and France) hold one-way causality running from economic growth and trade openness to CO2 emissions (IV) the environmental Kuznets curve hypothesis is validated only for the USA. Robust policy implications can be derived from this study. First, without harming the economy, these countries can reduce the use of energy consumption for lower pollution. Second, the amount of trade should be decreased to lower the emissions because the authors find that an increase in trade does Granger cause to CO2 emissions in the long run. Originality/value: There has been no study that investigated the relationship between CO2 emissions, real income, consumption of energy and international trade in the environmental Kuznets relation for the top CO2 emitter’s countries over the period of 1971–2013. The authors did a comparative study of the empirical finding among these nations. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","CO2 emissions; Energy consumption; Environmental Kuznets curve; Granger causality test; Trade openness","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; energy use; Granger causality test; international trade; Kuznets curve; trade openness; Australia; Canada; France; Iran; Italy; Saudi Arabia; Spain; United Kingdom; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074011722

A new managed lane strategy is presented that minimizes the total passenger travel time on the freeway. This managed lane focuses on simultaneously optimizing toll schemes on the high occupancy toll (HOT) lane and the operation of the general purpose (GP) lanes. With reduced congestion and thus reduced number of acceleration and deceleration events associated with stop-and-go traffic, fuel efficiency increases and emissions are reduced. PARAMICS microscopic traffic simulator, which considers the behavior of individual vehicles (e.g., acceleration, deceleration, and lane changing behavior) is used to collect traffic performance and emission data for estimating mobility and emissions measures (i.e., operating phase). While previous studies only focused on operating phase impact, this study uses a Leontief input-output (I-O) model to establish the financial flow between industries to capture the large-scale environmental impacts of HOT lane deployment (i.e., secondary impact). The core of the new evaluation approach lies in its capability to provide a more thorough assessment of the environmental impacts of traffic management schemes by quantifying the impacts associated with the interplay between the activities of various sectors and the transportation industry. The I-O model is utilized to assess the indirect impacts of induced demand generated from network improvements and evaluate the environmental impacts of HOT lane deployment in regional economies. The developed approach is applied to The City of Calgary. The results of the study show that the traditional approaches that only evaluate the operating phase impacts of transportation strategies considerably overestimate the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Emissions; high occupancy toll (HOT) lane; input-output analysis; operating phase impact; secondary impact","Economic analysis; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Highway traffic control; Particulate emissions; Sustainable development; Traffic congestion; Travel time; Vehicle actuated signals; Acceleration and deceleration; High-occupancy tolls; Input output analysis; Lane-changing behaviors; Operating phase; Secondary impacts; Traffic management scheme; Transportation strategies; Environmental impact; design; emission control; environmental economics; environmental impact; fuel consumption; input-output analysis; motorway; sustainability; traffic management; travel time",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061972382

Many urbanists have argued that the world could not sustain the current pattern of development, that cities are responsible for much of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, and that only strategies for sustainable urban development can turn things around. All these arguments point toward the need to understand, plan, and manage city-regions on a planetary level. Angel’s research is based on statistical and spatial analysis of data on 3, 646 large cities worldwide with more than 100, 000 people. He provides both cross-sectional analysis describing the population, area, and fragmentation of land uses in world cities and longitudinal analysis showing how they have changed over time. His uses computer tools to marshal data, analyze it, and then construct theory from facts. His research provides insights into important questions that have important implications for planning. He notes that urban land cover has been growing very rapidly, but in the year 2000 cities covered less than one-half of one percent of the earth’s land area. While city populations have also been growing rapidly, he found that in the final decade of the twentieth century city populations grew at less than half the rate that urban land cover grew. Urban densities have actually been declining almost everywhere for more than a century if one considers the entire urban area, and Angel feels there is no possibility that the global decline in urban densities will slow down any time soon. In terms of centrality and dispersal, Angel describes two sequential transformations: first, from the monocentric city to a regional form with jobs in the center and housing in suburbs; and then, in a second transformation, to a polycentric network of cities with both housing and work decentralized. © 2020 selection and editorial matter, Richard T.

Since then, governments have made substantial efforts in developing gender-responsive policies and implementation strategies. The advent of climate change and its effects, which have continued to impact rural livelihoods and especially food security, demands that gender mainstreaming efforts are accelerated. Effective gender mainstreaming requires that gender is sufficiently integrated in policies, development plans, and implementation strategies, supported by budgetary allocations. This study analyzes the extent of gender integration in agricultural and natural resource policies in Uganda and Tanzania, and how gender is budgeted for in implementation plans at district and lower governance levels. A total of 155 policy documents, development plans, and annual action plans from national, district, and sub-county/ward levels were reviewed. In addition, district and sub-county budgets for four consecutive financial years from 2012/2013 to 2015/2016 were analyzed for gender allocations. Results show that whereas there is increasing gender responsiveness in both countries, (i) gender issues are still interpreted as “women issues,” (ii) there is disharmony in gender mainstreaming across governance levels, (iii) budgeting for gender is not yet fully embraced by governments, (iii) allocations to gender at sub-national level remain inconsistently low with sharp differences between estimated and actual budgets, and (iv) gender activities do not address any structural inequalities. We propose approaches that increase capacity to develop and execute gender-responsive policies, implementation plans, and budgets. © 2019, The Author(s).",,"Agriculture; Budget control; Food supply; Natural resources; Public policy; Budgetary allocation; Development plans; Gender equality; Implementation strategies; National level; Policy documents; Resource policy; Rural livelihood; Climate change; climate change; environmental policy; equity; food security; gender relations; livelihood; natural resource; rural area; Beijing [China]; China; Tanzania; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066893916

Advection, momentum, heat, and mass are all terms commonly used in thermofluids, that are also associated with our climate. The classical boundary layer establishes a foundation from which research and discussions on the atmospheric boundary layer, climate changes and global warming are possible. It provides a platform for characterizing convectively and perhaps radiatively driven flows that equally define the behavioral aspects of atmospheric boundary layer. The planetary or atmospheric boundary layer is a vigorously mixed convective layer. Many of the concepts and results from classical boundary layer theory can be readily applied to planetary boundary layer approximations. For example, the oceans play a major role in maintaining the Earth's energy balance and supporting CO2 from the atmosphere. Similar to thin boundary layer flows, the atmosphere and oceans are equally thin layers of fluid with gravitational and rotational acceleration effects. To solve a problem, one must first acknowledge its existence and the realities experienced or associated with the problem. The climate crisis facing planet Earth is a challenging problem to solve. The geographic and temporal distribution of climate change effects tasks each and every one of us to make changes to our manner of energy use for the sustainable benefit of the planet. Climate change prevention, adaptation and mitigation is critical for many developing countries, mostly in Africa and Southeast Asia. Developing nations are most vulnerable to the effects of the climate quandary. Developing nations may have often looked outwards for solutions to their problems, however, climate changes may necessitate autochthonous or endogenous solutions to curb local problems. This chapter, in broad strokes, reviews and examines climate issues concerned with selected developing nations. Notably, however, the aspects examined and discussed may broadly be applicable to all developing nations. In summary, innovations, stretching from basic and applied university research to dissemination of information in the market place, will be key in developing local technologies to meet the challenges of a carbon-constrained world. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.","Africa; Asia; Climate change; Developing nations; Renewable energy",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092663324

In Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, dockless bike-sharing was first introduced in Monas area in July 2018. Although dockless bike-sharing has many benefits, it also brings some challenges. User's freedom to put the bike anywhere after use is one of the benefits but also one of the challenges because of the scattered bikes. Since there is only a small number of researches that focuses on dockless bike-sharing system and its association with the parking capacity, we decided to start this research.

Such industrial networks consequently provide new economic opportunities as value-added products can be produced from waste CO2. However, investments in such networks at national or transnational scales entail technical, social and environmental risks that in turn affect the expected economic returns, with a further potential in devaluation of such investments. This study presents a hazard identification (HAZID) and quantitative risk assessment (QRA) methodology for large-scale carbon capture and utilisation networks based on existing sources and sinks in the State of Qatar, capturing technical viabilities at the process and systems levels, and compliance with local and international environment regulations. The QRA integrates hydrocarbon leakage and dispersion modelling simulation using data obtained from existing GIS databases into a single model. In assessing network failure scenarios, the model considers (a) CO2 sources, such as from LNG plant and chemical process industries, such as Methanol, Urea and Gas-to-Liquid (GTL) fuels; (b) CO2 transportation (pipeline) service corridors; and (c) CO2 sinks that manufacture value added products. Stochastic variables used to assess network robustness are represented by pipeline layouts, material and composition, diameter, pressure, temperature, heat and mass balance, other equipment items, e.g. compression station, turbine and reactors. The results demonstrate that the CO2 network should be located outside high population density area. The approach demonstrates CO2 release from 20” pipeline rupture to nearby residential area is relatively very low 19.07 μg/m3 (0.0191 ppm) that would no impact the population while the CO2 concentration at 1,000 meter wide from the centerline, 4 μg/m3. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","CO2utilisation; GTL; Methanol; Quantitative Risk Assessment; Urea",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092795344

In Brazil, concentrated rainfall and ineffective urban drainage systems add to this context and may impact the population with flash floods. Although sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) are widely used for flood mitigation, it is still not very well known how those strategies behave in semi-arid regions, where most of the time the weather is very dry In Brazil, flood mitigation still mostly involves structural measures such as larger pipes or channels, with limited guidance for SuDS use due to the great resistance to change by citizens and managers. This study sought to analyse the efficacy of SuDS in Campina Grande, a semi-arid region of Brazil. A land-use and legislation-based methodology was developed with physical, climate, hydrological and governance data for three catchments and 312 sub-catchments in 30 applications and simulations. Simulations suggest that these strategies would be appropriate for semi-arid regions, with reductions in the flooded area, flooding volume, and impacts. This study is of relevance for cities with a similar climate to reach a sustainable level of urban drainage services, supporting the integration of urban planning and water resources management. © 2020 by the authors.","Flooding mitigation; Semi-arid; Sustainable drainage systems","catchment; developing world; drainage network; empirical analysis; flash flood; flooding; land use; legislation; mitigation; rainfall; semiarid region; sustainability; urbanization; water management; water planning; water resource; Brazil; Campina Grande; Paraiba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079811998

However, the continuous increase in helium demand with a growing rate of about 5%, industrial projects are searching for economic approaches to recover helium from sales gas at the earlier stages of the liquefaction process. This work investigates the techno-economic and environmental benefits of recovering helium from sale gas product. Among the available recovery technologies, namely, cryogenic fraction, adsorption-based processes, and membrane-based processes, the cryogenic fractionation is considered for analysis due to its wide use in industry. The cryogenic fractionation represented by three different configurations; single column, double columns fractionation, and cold box are developed using Aspen HYSYS to perform the steady-state simulation with a basis of 1400 MMSCFD of natural gas. Aspen Process Economic Analyzer and Aspen Energy Analyzer, are then used to carry out the economic evaluation and utility optimization steps. The results for all alternatives are compared in terms of helium recovery, emissions reduction, energy savings, and economic profitability. An illustrative case study is presented for the assessment of helium recovery for different helium molar composition in the NG feedstock and various helium selling prices. The results demonstrate cold box as the optimal technology for 3.5 vol% helium recovery with approximately $25.4 per kg of helium produced (PHP) compared to approximately $24.2 and $24.3 PHP for double column and single column options, respectively. Moreover, higher concentration of helium at around 7% indicates a profitability profile with lower overall net economic value of approximately $11.7 PHP for cold box alternative. The results for all options indicate high purity for helium with more than 98% and a recovery of more than 99%. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Helium recovery; liquefied natural gas (LNG); Process Simulation; Sales gas; Sustainable design",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092758807

The data obtained from the five fractions indicated that the concentration of metals varies among different locations in the study area. The total metal concentrations (%) in the exchangeable (F1), carbonate (F2), reducible (F3) and organic-bound (F4) fractions were measured to determine the mobility of each studied metal. The sum of the two fractions F3 and F4 represented 70% of the Cu, 72% of the Zn and 36% of the Pb. However, the sum of the three fractions F2, F3 and F4 represented 76%, 74%, 68% and 58% of the Cd, Ni, Fe and Mn, respectively. Approximately 46% of the total copper was related to organics, which could reflect a high mobility of copper in these sediments. The maximum mobility of metals in the sediments was confirmed by the bioavailability factor (BF), which was within the ranges of 0.47–0.93, 0.34–0.92, 0.62–0.95, 0.69–0.95, 0.24–0.82, 0.54–0.98, and 0.60–0.95 for Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Pb, Cd, and Ni, respectively. Based on the BF, the metals exhibited the following order: Cu ≈ Zn &gt; Cd ≈ Ni ≈ Fe &gt; Mn &gt; Pb. The high levels of BF for the studied metals could reflect the potential for toxic metals to be easily released into the marine environment. The risk assessment code for Cd showed a medium risk in five sediment samples of the northern and southern regions and a high risk to the aquatic environment in the other sediment samples.

Knowledge on their harmful effects are mainly due to studies carried out with whole air particles, with the contribution of their different fractions remaining largely unknown. Herein, a set of urban PM2.5 samples were collected during daytime and nighttime periods in autumn and spring, aiming to address the seasonal and day-night variability of water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) composition. In vitro analysis of the oxidative and pro-inflammatory potential of WSOM samples was carried out in both acute (24 h) and chronic (3 weeks) exposure setups using Raw264.7 macrophages as cell model. Findings revealed that the structural composition of WSOM samples differs between seasons and in a day-night cycle. Cell exposure resulted in an increase in the transcription of the cytoprotective Hmox1 and pro-inflammatory genes Il1b and Nos2, leading to a moderate pro-inflammatory status. These macrophages showed an impaired capacity to subsequently respond to a strong pro-inflammatory stimulus such as bacterial lipopolysaccharide, which may implicate a compromised capacity to manage harmful pathogens. Further investigation on aerosol WSOM could help to constrain the mechanisms of WSOM-induced respiratory diseases and contribute to PM2.5 regulations. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Biogeochemistry; Macrophages; Organic compounds; Aerodynamic diameters; Fine particulate matter; Inflammatory genes; Lipopolysaccharides; Pro-inflammatory stimuli; Structural composition; Structural feature; Water-soluble organic matter; Transcription; bacterium lipopolysaccharide; heme oxygenase 1; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 1beta; nitric oxide; organic matter; water; cell; laboratory method; organic matter; particle size; particulate matter; polysaccharide; public health; seasonal variation; solubility; aerosol; animal cell; Article; autumn; chemical composition; circadian rhythm; controlled study; cytotoxicity; gene expression; in vitro study; inflammation; macrophage; mouse; night; nonhuman; particulate matter; protein expression; RAW 264.7 cell line; respiratory tract disease; seasonal variation; spring; urban area; aerosol; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; particle size; particulate matter; season; Bacteria (microorganisms); Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075442892

Both gridded observations and model simulation data are analyzed. Observations reveal that the extreme daily precipitation events contribute nearly 40% (70%) to the accumulated amount of rainfall in the wet (dry) regions of the Peninsula for the period 1970–1999. The regional climate model simulations show a large overestimation of the annual mean rainfall in the present climate. However, the model data also depicts almost an enhanced contribution of extreme daily precipitation events to the accumulated rainfall over the Peninsula. In agreement with observations, the simulated extreme precipitation events show a small (large) contribution to total rainfall in the wet (dry) regions. The relative contribution of extreme daily precipitation events to total rainfall increases over the southern and central parts of the Peninsula in case of the future climate. We also found an increase in the accumulated amount of simulated precipitation associated with extreme events in the future climate when compared to the reference period. This indicates that extreme events are likely to become more intense over the Peninsula in the future. The results indicate an increase in daily precipitation intensities over the Arabian Peninsula in the future.

Using literature input data, a steady state model has been built which allows assessment of the final fuel cell efficiency and sensitivity of this value to several variables including the extent of parasitic gasification of the fuel (reverse Boudouard reaction). It is shown that for a hybrid DCFC system, which utilises both primary (solid oxide membrane) and secondary (molten carbonate) electrolytes, a slurry based feed of coal and carbonate could provide enough waste heat from electrochemical inefficiency to both retain the molten feed temperature, as well as provide pre-heating for inlet air streams to achieve an overall system efficiency of over 70%. Higher system efficiencies may be possible, however will depend heavily on the cell design and specifically on increasing the electrochemical efficiency at the expense of waste heat generated. Additional parasitic power input is required in these cases. A base case of assumptions has been evaluated with sensitivity of the system efficiency compared for the carbon slurry loading, the carbon and oxygen conversion per pass of the fuel cell (fuel utilisation), equipment heat losses, amount of coal char ash present and the extent of carbon corrosion within the cell. Under the base case investigated, life cycle emissions of the technology have been estimated (using several assumptions) at 647 kg CO2/MWh at 70% system efficiency, with no carbon storage, while emissions of 93 kg CO2/MWh at 66% system efficiency are potentially achievable (dependent on accuracy of assumptions) if carbon dioxide is able to be effectively sequestered. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Direct carbon fuel cell; Electrochemical efficiency; Mass and enthalpy balance; System efficiency","Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Coal; Corrosion; Digital storage; Efficiency; Enthalpy; Life cycle; Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC); Waste heat; Accuracy of assumption; Carbon emissions; Enthalpy balance; Fuel cell efficiency; Life cycle emissions; Solid oxide membranes; Steady-state modeling; System efficiency; Direct carbon fuel cells (DCFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074149399

In this way, in this paper, a multi-agent generation expansion planning in a joint multi-electricity market environment is proposed. The GENCO (Generation Company) agents, competing in a deregulated structure, try to obtain the most profitable investment and operation plan regarding the incentives/taxes that the regulatory sector legislates. The multi-area market assumption encourages the GENCOs to offer their energy blocks to adjacent electricity markets whenever the production capacity is higher than the local load. To confront the uncertainties such as wind speed, market price, and load demand, the Markov chain method is employed. The regulatory entity which monitors the market feedbacks such as reliability, pollution, and renewable penetration, announces the smart stimulating signals to the agents. The signals are sent back to the agents based on a MIMO (Multi Input Multi Output) PID (Proportional–Integral–Derivative) controller which has predefined social-welfare-oriented reference values. In order to verify the efficacy of the study, the results are compared with conventional single electricity market planning framework. The findings underline that by linking the markets together and applying the MIMO controller, the social welfare goals including costs, emissions, and reliability of supply could be improved. A typical average 25 and 50 percent reduction in carbon emission and tracking deviation respectively, verifies the effectiveness of the proposed model. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Generation expansion planning; Multi electricity markets; Regulatory intervention; Renewable energy; Smart pollution control; Uncertainty management","Commerce; Electric industry; Markov processes; MIMO systems; Multi agent systems; Pollution control; Power markets; Proportional control systems; Sustainable development; Wind; Electricity market planning; Generation companies; Generation expansion planning; Multi input multi output; Regulatory interventions; Reliability of supply; Renewable energies; Uncertainty management; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071972851

It necessitates selective and energy-efficient electrocatalysts - a requirement met today only using noble metals such as gold and silver. Here, we show that the two-dimensional sulfur planes in semimetallic titanium disulfide (TiS2) provide an earth-abundant alternative. In situ Fourier transform infrared mechanistic studies reveal that CO2 binds to conductive disulfide planes as intermediate monothiocarbonate. The sulfur-CO2 intermediate state steers the reduction kinetics toward mainly CO. Using TiS2 thin films, we reach cathodic energy efficiencies up to 64% at 5 mA cm2. We conclude with directions for the further synthesis and study of semimetallic disulfides developing CO-selective electrocatalysts. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","CO2 reduction reaction; Electrocatalysis; Titanium disulfide","Carbon dioxide; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Energy efficiency; Sulfur compounds; CO2 reduction; Electro reduction; Energy efficient; Fourier transform infra reds; Intermediate state; Mechanistic studies; Reduction kinetics; Titanium disulfide; Titanium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076086053

The aim of the present study was to evaluate how aridity exerts an influence on CSR functional groups of aquatic plants in temporary pools. Aquatic plants were sampled from 27 temporary pools in areas with a climatic gradient of evaporation, precipitation, and temperature. The distribution of functional groups along the environmental gradient was analyzed through redundancy analysis and patterns of CSR strategies were analyzed using linear correlation. We found that assemblages of macrophyte ponds were composed mainly of intermediate R/CR strategies. Evaporation exerted a positive influence on the occurrence of species with larger specific leaf area and a negative influence on the occurrence of taller species. Moreover, ponds in regions with greater evaporation had greater species richness (r2 = 0.2, P &lt; 0.01). The same was found for competitors (r2 = 0.2, P &lt; 0.01) but not for ruderal or tolerant classes. In conclusion, climatic conditions influence CSR classes and exert a specific influence on the specific functional traits of species in temporary pools of semiarid regions. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptive strategies; Environmental gradient; Ephemeral wetlands; Temporary pools","aridity; climate variation; competition (ecology); environmental gradient; evaporation; leaf area; macrophyte; ruderal; semiarid region; species richness; stress resistance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074109113

Although the majority of recent electricity storage system installations have a duration at rated power of up to ∼4 h, several trends and potential applications are identified that require electricity storage with longer durations of 10 to ∼100 h. Such a duration range lies between daily needs that can be satisfied with technologies with the cost structure of lithium-ion batteries and seasonal storage utilizing chemical storage in underground reservoirs. The economics of long-duration storage applications are considered, including contributions for both energy time shift and capacity payments and are shown to differ from the cost structure of applications well served by lithium-ion batteries. In particular, the capital cost for the energy subsystem must be substantially reduced to ∼3 $/kWh (for a duration of ∼100 h), ∼7 $/kWh (for a duration of ∼50 h), or ∼40 $/kWh (for a duration of ∼10 h) on a fully installed basis. Recent developments in major technology classes that may approach the targets of the long-duration electricity storage (LDES) cost framework, including electrochemical, thermal, and mechanical, are briefly reviewed. This perspective, which illustrates the importance of low-cost and high-energy-density storage media, motivates new concepts and approaches for how LDES systems could be economical and provide value to the electricity grid. The feasibility of incorporating a large share of power from variable energy resources such as wind and solar generators depends on the development of cost-effective and application-tailored technologies such as energy storage. Energy storage technologies with longer durations of 10 to 100 h could enable a grid with more renewable power, if the appropriate cost structure and performance—capital costs for power and energy, round-trip efficiency, self-discharge, etc.—can be realized. Although current technologies such as lithium-ion batteries are suitable for a number of applications on the grid, they are not suitable for longer-duration storage applications. Although 10 to 100 h energy storage will help facilitate the integration of renewable power on the grid, it is not long enough to last for seasons, and is not sufficient to enable a grid with 100% renewable power. Given the capital-intensive nature of scaling up a storage technology that can be impactful to the overall electricity grid, rigorous technical and economic evaluations at the laboratory and pilot scale are required. Several major classes of storage technologies may address the long-duration electricity storage cost and performance framework, and efforts are accelerating to identify and develop the most promising storage systems. Long-duration electricity storage systems (10 to ∼100 h at rated power) may significantly advance the use of variable renewables (wind and solar) and provide resiliency to electricity supply interruptions, if storage assets that can be widely deployed and that have a much different cost structure (i.e., installed energy subsystem costs of ∼5 to 35 $/kWh, installed power subsystem costs of ∼500 to 1,000 $/kW, and a round-trip efficiency of >50%) than Li-ion can be developed. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","batteries; grid electricity storage; high renewables electricity grid; long-duration electricity storage; mechanical storage; scale up; technoeconomic analysis; thermal storage","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric energy storage; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Heat storage; Ions; Lithium-ion batteries; Natural gas deposits; Solar cells; Underground reservoirs; Electricity grids; Electricity storages; Grid electricity; Scale-up; Techno-Economic analysis; Thermal storage; Electric power transmission networks; alternative energy; economics; electricity; energy storage; technological development; thermal power; underground storage; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077512679

Techniques originating from the domains of machine learning, pattern recognition and image processing are used to purify the sample of neutrino candidates and for the analysis of the obtained skymap. In contrast to a dedicated search for a specific neutrino emission model, this approach is sensitive to a wide range of possible morphologies of potential sources of high-energy neutrino emission. The application of these methods to ANTARES data yields a large-scale excess with a post-trial significance of 2.5σ. Applied to public data from IceCube in its IC40 configuration, an excess consistent with the results from ANTARES is observed with a post-trial significance of 2.1σ. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Anisotropy; Astroparticle physics; Neutrino astronomy; Pattern recognition","Anisotropy; Image processing; Learning systems; Pattern recognition; Telescopes; Astroparticle physics; High energy neutrinos; Model independent; Neutrino astronomy; Neutrino emission; Neutrino sources; Neutrino telescopes; Potential sources; Neutrons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067812340

In order to produce a favorable wetting state, it is critical to have a clear picture of the initial wetting properties of the rock surface. This study aimed to improve the understanding of carbonate wettability by examining the impact of acid, base, and their mixture on wettability of calcite surfaces using different analytical tools (contact angle measurements, zeta potential test, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, interfacial tension measurements, and fluorescence ultraviolet spectroscopy). The acid number (AN) and the ratio of the basic component (quinoline) to the acidic component (stearic acid) were systematically varied in model oil solutions to elucidate the effect of simultaneous presence of the acid and base on the wettability alteration process. The results showed that as the acid concentration increases, the wettability alteration toward the oil-wet state is enhanced. However, the impact of the base was significant at high concentrations, where the wettability was changed toward the neutral state. Addition of the basic compound to the acidic model oil hindered the impact of stearic acid on wettability alteration. Although the impact of the basic component on wettability alteration of calcite seems to be weaker than that of the acidic component, presence of the base can alter the wetting characteristics of the surface. Acid and base concentrations and their ratio dictate the extent of calcite wettability alteration. Slight impact of the base on the wettability alteration process was observed for a system with an AN of 0.25. However, at higher ANs, an increase in the base number (BN) to AN ratio from 0 to 1 resulted in a remarkable reduction in the contact angle; while the contact angle increased again when the BN to AN ratio was 4. Further investigations (for systems with AN = 1) revealed that at the BN to AN ratio of 0.25 and 1, adsorption of the basic component on the surface was unlikely to happen. Formation of an acid-base complex could hinder the access of stearate ions to the calcite surface. At the BN to AN ratio of 1, the quinoline concentration was equal to that for stearic acid, which may enhance the acid-base interactions; hence, more stearic acid would be involved in acid-base complexes. However, once the base concentration became higher than the acid concentration (BN to AN = 4), an excess amount of the base, which was not involved in the complex mixtures with acid molecules, might adsorb on the surface.

We developed a method using downscaled global climate models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to project precipitation and temperatures; these were used to force a Storm Water Management Model (SWMM). Three scenarios, a historical and two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) with five GCMs, were used to produce ensemble results. All GCMs in both RCP scenarios projected increases in precipitation and temperature compared to historical conditions. Both RCPs exhibited their largest increases in precipitation, streamflow, total suspended solids (TSS), total nitrogen (TN), and total phosphorous (TP) loads in the winter, summer exhibited the largest increase in temperature. Median loads of TSS, TN, and TP increased 3.1%, 2.5%, and 9.9%, respectively, for RCP 4.5, and increased 3.8%, 3.1%, and 10.4%, respectively, for RCP 8.5. Median reductions in TSS, TN, and TP SCM efficiency for RCP 4.5 were projected to be 6%, 7%, and 11%, respectively; and 11%, 12%, and 17% for RCP 8.5, respectively. Thus, it is likely that additional efforts will be needed to meet water quality goals in the future. Methods such as these can help create climate resilient watershed improvement strategies and guide urban stormwater planning against likely future changes as a result of CC. © 2019, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.","Climate change (CC); Dry duration curves; Ensemble approach; Global climate models (GCMs); Hydrologic model; Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves","climate change; climate modeling; CMIP; concentration (composition); ensemble forecasting; global climate; hydrological modeling; stormwater; water management; water quality; watershed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076190696

Design/methodology/approach: Four areas of living were selected for the study: household electricity, space heating, transport and food consumption. The study used a quantitative research approach in which the impact of selected scenarios of an average Finnish household was assessed. Findings: Findings suggest that GHG savings from behavioural change regarding household electricity remain marginal in comparison to savings gained from transportation related measures. Transportation also provides the most cost-efficient ways to decrease GHGs but not in all cases. Based on the results, the authors suggest that smart technologies, such as on-line, active feedback systems could have a major role in guiding household energy use. Also, given the high GHG savings from transport, the authors highlight the importance of providing infrastructure and services for clean mobility, and in designing well-functioning and compact cities enabling shorter travels. Originality/value: The aim of our study was twofold – by analysing the case household’s choices, we obtained information on environmental and economic impacts, but in addition to this, the aim was to open discussion on the role of households in tackling climate change and how to support households in making sustainable choices. Although research regarding household energy behaviour is vast, so far very few studies have focused on both economic and environmental impacts of households’ everyday actions. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Carbon saving measures; CO2 emission; CO2 mitigation; Cost comparison; Cost minimization; Cost-efficiency; Electricity; Food consumption; Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG); Household energy behaviour; Scenario analysis; Sustainable choices; Sustainable mobility; Transport","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Electricity; Energy conservation; Environmental impact; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Sustainable development; Thermal processing (foods); Carbon saving; CO2 emissions; CO2 mitigation; Cost comparisons; Cost efficiency; Cost minimization; Food consumption; Household energy; Scenario analysis; Sustainable choices; Sustainable mobility; Transport; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069918920

Within this new trend, moped scooter-sharing is experiencing a great boom in many cities worldwide, particularly in Europe. The generalization of electric moped scooter-sharing services can bring benefits such as lowering noise and air pollution or reducing road congestion, with important implication for improving the livability and quality of life in urban areas. To date, many contributions have been conducted to characterize innovative mobility options such as car-sharing or bike-sharing, but almost no efforts have been devoted to explore the use of moped scooter-sharing services. Based on the information collected through an online survey disseminated in different Spanish cities, we developed a generalized ordered logit model to identify the key drivers determining the adoption and frequency of use of moped scooter-sharing services in urban areas. The research concludes the main role played by some sociodemographic and travel-related variables, such as age or level of education, while personal opinions and attitudes were not generally found statistically significant. The research found somehow similar profiles for occasional and frequent users of moped scooter-sharing, then public authorities should make further efforts to overcome the barriers related to the first contact with this mobility option. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Generalized ordered logit model; Moped scooter-sharing; Shared mobility; Spain; Urban mobility; User perception","electric vehicle; logit analysis; mobility; numerical model; perception; urban area; urban transport; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071222253

Strong winds transport and disperse PM2.5, which can travel over long distances. Smoke from wildfires is a major episodic and seasonal hazard in Southern California (SoCal), where the onset of Santa Ana winds (SAWs) in early fall before the first rains of winter is associated with the region's most damaging wildfires. However, SAWs also tend to improve visibility as they sweep haze particles from highly polluted areas far out to sea. Previous studies characterizing PM2.5 in the region are limited in time span and spatial extent, and have either addressed only a single event in time or short time series at a limited set of sites. Here we study the space-time relationship between daily levels of PM2.5 in SoCal and SAWs spanning 1999–2012 and also further identify the impact of wildfire smoke on this relationship. We used a rolling correlation approach to characterize the spatial-temporal variability of daily SAW and PM2.5. SAWs tend to lower PM2.5 levels, particularly along the coast and in urban areas, in the absence of wildfires upwind. On the other hand, SAWs markedly increase PM2.5 in zip codes downwind of wildfires. These empirical relationships can be used to identify windows of vulnerability for public health and orient preventive measures. ©2019.

Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and ammonia (NH3) are toxic gases emitted from geothermal power generation that have negative impacts on health and the environment. Oxidation of H2S leads to formation of SO2 that also has health and environmental effects. The Cerro Prieto geothermal power plant (CP-GPP) is one of the largest in the world and is located 30 km south of Mexicali, a border city between Mexico and the US. Power from this plant is sold to both countries. In order to assess the potential effects of the emissions from the GPP on nearby low-income communities, H2S, SO2 and NH3 concentrations were measured at Nuevo León, El Chimi, and Estación Delta, using passive samplers from November 2013 to June 2014. The highest concentrations of H2S were recorded during periods of high atmospheric stability, and exceeded the limit recommended by the WHO (150 μg m−3, 24-h) three times downwind from the GPP. Similarly, the mean SO2 concentrations at all three sites exceeded the limit established by the NOM-022-SSA1-2010 (288 μg m−3, 24-h), while NH3 concentrations exceeded the limits established by the OEHHA (100 μg m−3, 24-h) eight times at Nuevo León. A backward trajectory analysis indicated transport of air masses from the GPP to El Chimi and Estación Delta sampling sites. The results indicate that GPP's emissions could affect the residents in the surrounding areas, warranting public health action to investigate exposures and risks. © 2019 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air pollution; Backward trajectory model; Geothermal power plant emissions; Health effects; Hydrogen sulfide; Meteorological conditions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073033081

However, even with this existing wide range of benefits, green roof technology research and markets in terms of implementation and widescale commercial adoption is relatively non-existent in temperate climates of the world such as the UK, compared to other regions with different prevailing climatic characteristics. This research investigates the causative factors and barriers for this relatively slow rate of adoption both from technological and economic perspectives with the United Kingdom as a case study. A number of experimental papers on energy savings benefits from green roofs were compiled; and from the analysis of collated data, it was found that green roofs tend to perform better from an energy savings perspective in hotter climates of the world or during the summer season in colder climates when temperatures are higher such as seasonal heatwaves. Further research into the energy savings behaviour during winter in temperate regions is required to assert the all-season suitability of green roofs for implementation in new builds within the United Kingdom. Government legislation and incentives could potentially increase wide-scale adoption. The performance of green roofs is however found to be largely climate dependent, meaning the performance varies across different regions of the world, therefore increased local research and quantification into metrics will lead to better understanding and potential adoption of green roofs and how to best optimise their design according to the region in which they are to be installed. © 2020 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Binary alloys; Biodiversity; Economic analysis; Energy conservation; Retrofitting; Roofs; Sustainable development; Economic perspective; Government legislations; Implementation barriers; In- situ monitoring; Local air pollutions; Passive energy savings; Stormwater retention; Technology research; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079645927

The producers’ portion of economic damages was 16 percent in the pessimistic scenario and 9 percent in the optimistic. The other economic sectors (indirect effect of climate change) were estimated at 24 percent in the pessimistic scenario to 13 percent in the optimistic case. Additionally, analysis of different scenarios (from optimistic to pessimistic) indicated a low status of welfare among consumers.

The situation is exacerbated by continual/increase in gas flaring, mismanagement of land that releases nitrous oxide (N2O) including ecological-disturbances and imbalance. To reduce the impact of greenhouse gas emission, especially in low-income regions, then using a bio-approach becomes imperative. Research Method: The work adopted a theoretical approach (data mining), x-raying/amplifying the important role trees plays in our environment towards reducing greenhouse gas emission. Findings: Trees has been found/confirmed to be able to capture and lock carbon in the form of CO2 in their biomass, thereby helping in reducing the amount of CO2 content in the atmosphere. Findings of this study revealed that trees act as a clean mechanism that can be used, and has been able to reduce CO2 content out of the atmosphere. Several reviewed research findings indicated a significant (p<0.05) increase in carbon sequestration potential of various tree species. Research Limitations: Field verification for data obtained through data mining was only verified through literature search. Originality/value: The outcome of the study presented a view that trees can statistically act as a clean biological mechanism approach towards environmental, agricultural including human health sustainability in the face of climate change. © 2020, Faculty of Agricultural Sciences, Sabaragamuwa University of Sri Lanka.

Despite progress from national and global interventions, a staggering proportion of the Global South remains water insecure. Rapid urban growth and associated demographic changes, climate change, and governance failure have also fostered the growth and expansion of urban informal settlements and slums where widespread poverty and environmental hazards exacerbate the impact of water insecurity on health. This article reflects on the interactions between water insecurity and urban poverty in the Global South across four categories of health outcomes: gastrointestinal diseases, mosquito-borne diseases, injuries, and mental illness. These examples highlight the mechanisms through which urban poverty exacerbates the adverse health effects of water insecurity. Methods: The four selected health outcomes were chosen a priori to represent two communicable conditions with well-developed literatures, and two noncommunicable conditions with newer literatures that have emerged over the last decade. We conducted a narrative literature review of scholarly and gray literature appearing between January 2000 and April 2019 using several online scholarly databases. Results: Gastrointestinal diseases, mosquito-borne diseases, injuries, and mental illness all exemplified the relationship between water insecurity and urban poverty through human biological pathways. For each of the four health categories, we identified frontiers for human biology research contributions to the water-poverty-health nexus. Conclusions: We discuss our findings in the context of three crosscutting themes that merit innovative research approaches: stressor interactions and trade-offs, exposure thresholds, and intervention efficacy. We reiterate that the global burden of disease associated with water insecurity cannot be addressed in isolation from efforts to alleviate extreme poverty. © 2019 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"water; catering service; developing country; human; poverty; public health; urban population; Developing Countries; Food Supply; Humans; Poverty; Public Health; Urban Population; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076186168

Sophisticated modeling techniques have been developed to analyze the interaction of the urban areas with the regional climate. However, in most cases, the assessment of outdoor thermal comfort is not based on a long-term analysis and provides results only for specific meteorological conditions. In this study, we apply a clustering method to yearly weather files with the aim of obtaining representative boundary conditions for urban microclimatic models. The results describe typical-day weather situations commonly known as weather types. The study is carried out in the hot and humid tropical conditions of Singapore, where ten weather types are defined. The analysis of the clusters’ performance shows adequate results. ENVI-met (v.4.3) model is used to evaluate the impact of weather types on thermal comfort in a courtyard surrounded by high-rise buildings. Results not only show different levels of thermal comfort but also different spatial distribution and diurnal evolution inside the courtyard for each weather type. We conclude that it is relevant to analyze thermal comfort in all predominant weather conditions so as to have an accurate and complete assessment of the existing thermal situation.

As a result, various land restoration and conservation efforts are underway at different scales. Ethiopia is one of the countries with huge investments in land restoration. Tremendous land management practices have been implemented across the country since the 1970s. However, the spatial distribution of the interventions has not been documented, and there is no systematic, quantitative evidence on whether land restoration efforts have achieved the restoration of desired ecosystem services. Therefore, we carried out a meta-analysis of peer-reviewed scientific literature related to land restoration efforts and their impacts in Ethiopia. Results show that most of the large-scale projects have been implemented in the highlands, specifically in Tigray and Amhara regions covering about 24 agroecological zones, and land restoration impact studies are mostly focused in the highlands but restricted in about 11 agroecological zones. The highest mean effect on agricultural productivity is obtained from the combination of bunds and biological interventions followed by conservation agriculture practices with 170% and 18% increases, respectively. However, bunds alone, biological intervention alone, and terracing (fanya juu) reveal negative effects on productivity. The mean effect of all land restoration interventions on soil organic carbon is positive, the highest effect being from “bunds + biological” (139%) followed by exclosure (90%). Reduced soil erosion and runoff are the dominant impacts of all interventions. The results can be used to improve existing guidelines to better match land restoration options with specific desired ecosystem functions and services. Although the focus of this study was on the evaluation of the impacts of land restoration efforts on selected ecosystem services, impacts on livelihood and national socioeconomy have not been examined. Thus, strengthening socioeconomic studies at national scale to assess the sustainability of land restoration initiatives is an essential next step. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","ecosystem services; effect size; land degradation; landscape restoration; meta-analysis","Agriculture; Economics; Ecosystems; Organic carbon; Productivity; Restoration; Ecosystem services; Effect size; Land degradation; Landscape restoration; Meta analysis; Land reclamation; ecosystem service; environmental impact; environmental restoration; land degradation; livelihood; meta-analysis; spatial distribution; Amhara; Ethiopia; Tigray",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073831017

However, climate change is not a sole stressor. Most coral reefs around the world are threatened by a myriad of local stressors, including overfishing, destructive fishing, untreated sewage, agriculture effluents (nutrients and pesticides), and siltation due to deforestation. Reefs will not survive the severe effects of this plethora of stressors while waiting until we mitigate climate change. In order to safeguard reefs, we need to adopt a new narrative - ""there are diverse ways in which we can improve the chances of saving coral reefs"" - by acting now to: (i) improve their local protection and marine protected area networks, (ii) alleviate their critical local stressors, (iii) restore degraded and damaged reefs, and (iv) promote reef resilience and adaptation (e.g. adaptation networks, assisted evolution) to the changing conditions, notably climate change effects.

Climate-smart agriculture (CSA) offers a unique opportunity to adapt to the effects of climate change while at the same time mitigating GHG emissions. The low response to the adoption of CSA among small-scale farmers raises questions as to the factors influencing its adoption in the small-scale farming system. With the aid of a close-ended questionnaire, structured interviews were conducted and formed the basis on which data were generated from 327 small-scale farmers selected through random sampling. Descriptive statistics, Composite Score Index and a Generalized Ordered Logit Regression (gologit) model were employed for the analysis. The majority (56.6%) of the sampled farmers fell in the medium category of users of CSA practices, while the lowest proportion (17.7%) of the sampled farmers fell in the high category. The use of organic manure, crop rotation and crop diversification were the most popular CSA practices among the sampled farmers. Educational status, farm income, farming experience, size of farmland, contact with agricultural extension, exposure to media, agricultural production activity, membership of an agricultural association or group and the perception of the impact of climate change were found to be statistically significant and positively correlated with the level of CSA adoption. Furthermore, off-farm income and distance of farm to homestead were statistically significant but negatively correlated with the CSA level of adoption. This paper argues that climate change-related education through improved extension contact and exposure to mass media can strengthen integrated farm activities that bolster farm income. Additionally, farmer associations or groups should be given adequate attention to facilitate CSA adoption as a means to climate change mitigation and resilience. © 2019 by the authors.","Adaptation; Climate change; Climate-smart agriculture; Mitigation; Small-scale farming","agricultural practice; agricultural production; climate change; crop rotation; education; farming system; greenhouse gas; perception; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079597117

In this research, remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) techniques were utilized to explore how native desert vegetation has recovered from hydrocarbon contamination after the Second Gulf War. By using RS techniques, change detection analysis was conducted to understand the changes about the coverage and extent of the total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) contamination and vegetation recovery. These changes were traced from 1991 until the hydrocarbon was no longer visible on the ground surface in 1998. GIS spatial analysis was conducted to determine the major ecosystem factors that influenced the vegetation recovery along with the removal of hydrocarbon disturbance. According to the results, autogenic recovery occurred at both sites within a few years and that desert native vegetation was found to have the ability to adapt and recover from hydrocarbon pollution. Native vegetation recovered across 31% of the TPH-contaminated areas at Umm Gudair and 34% at Wadi Al Batin. The changes in TPH contamination were significantly correlated with the soil type, vegetation type, geological substrates, geomorphological features, and annual precipitation. The vegetation recovery of dominant desert communities in the study area was influenced by soil type, geomorphological feature, and TPH-contaminated areas. Interestingly, the results showed that these desert communities can recover in areas contaminated by TPH at a higher rate than noncontaminated sites in the study area.

The author applied spatial simultaneous equations for random effects panel data to investigate the spatial interactions of adjacent countries over the period from 1998 to 2011. The findings reveal that energy consumption, environment degradation, and economic growth of a country influence those of its neighbours. Additionally, the results document bidirectional causal relationship between economic growth and environment pollution, as well as between environment pollution and energy consumption. Thus, there is a bidirectional relationship between energy use and economic growth.
