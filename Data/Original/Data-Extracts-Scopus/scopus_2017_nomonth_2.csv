The study of the catalytic simultaneous removal of soot and NO at relatively low temperatures (within the range of diesel engine exhaust: 150-450°C) has taken a paramount importance in pollution control area. Mixed oxides coming from perovskite-like materials, seems to be a promising catalyst for such purpose. In this way, the present work tested the La0.7Ag0.3MnO3 perovskite-like material, prepared for different synthetic routes, for the simultaneous removal of soot and NO. Three different synthetic routes are compared: microwave-assisted hydrothermal (HMW), microwave-assisted (MW) and solid state (SS). The catalytic activity of the prepared catalysts was tested in a temperature-controlled furnace inside which a sootcatalyst-sand fixed bed was placed. The mixture of carbonaceous material and catalysts was carried out with spatula (i.e. loose contact), keeping always a 1:9 weight ratio. The soot model used in this study consisted of a carbon black, FW200, from Orion Engineering. The soot-catalyst-sand mixture was exposed at a constant heating rate of 10°C/min up to 600°C, under a 2200 ppm NO/10% vol.O2/He atmosphere. The evolution of CO2, CO, NO, NOx, N2,O2 gases with temperature were followed by mass spectrometry and a KIGAZ 310 gas analyzer. The catalyst materials were also characterized by SEM, TEM, XRD, H2-TPR and O2-TPD. The results show a good catalytic behavior of the materials tested for the oxidation of soot. Figure 1 and Table 1 present the temperature at which soot ignition begins (Tig), and the temperatures at which the conversion of soot to CO2 was 50%, 90% and 100%, named as T50, T90 and T100, respectively. When it is compared the catalytic activity results with the non-catalytic one; it was found an ignition temperature shift of 278°C when the HMW-synthesized catalyst was used, and a shift of 241°C for the MW-synthesized catalyst. Also, the maximum soot oxidation peak, (T50), for all the catalytic systems evaluated in this study was shifted to lower temperatures according to the following decreasing order: non-catalytic &gt; SS &gt; HMW &gt; MW. Another important result regarding to catalytic soot oxidation, it is that no CO emission was found in the gas stream, indicating 100% selectivity toward CO2. In contrast, for the noncatalytic one, the selectivity CO2/CO ratio was near one. Copyright © American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

Laser Ignition Conference is an international forum for discussion on various aspects of laser-induced ignition, including novel giant-pulse micro-lasers, measurements and characterisation of plasma induced by laser ignition, new phenomena of laser breakdown or advanced combustion systems, packing of laser systems for harsh combustion environments and their applications. The purpose of this meeting is to share information on laser ignition and related sciences and technologies. The 5th Conference aims to presents the latest developments in lasers and laser technologies for the feasibility of laser ignition in practical combustion systems. The latest developments in non-laser ignition systems and studies that enhance our understanding of the ignition process. Combining regenerative and classical fossil energy sources is a major issue to be addressed in order to find solutions to the challenges of modern societies with respect to technology advances and low carbon footprint at the same time. Fossil energy sources will remain on the tableau due to their energy density and the mobility of combustion engines for cars, power trains, aviation, space and energy cogeneration, but only an efficient and low fuel usage will allow those to contribute to a low carbon footprint mix of energy. Laser-based ignition is believed to be a major contributor to efficient fossil fuel usage and thus a lower carbon footprint of mankind due to the variability and shape-ability of laser pulses that replace the electric spark to ignite the gas-fuel mixture. But a number of technological challenges need to be proved before laser spark plugs can realistically be adopted. Developments in laser & laser technologies - applications in laser ignition; Micro solid-state photonics: advanced laser crystals, ceramics and micro-domain controlled materials; Giant micro-photonics: mega-watt class giant pulse generation, laser damages phenomena; High power devices: high power VCSELs, DFB and VBG based diodes, fiber and fiber lasers etc. Integration approaches for harsh environmental suitable laser systems. Advanced ignition systems for transportation applications; Laser ignition systems for stationary natural gas engines; Laser ignition in aerospace applications; Measurement techniques for induced plasmas, ignition & combustion processes; Round table discussions - standardization, legislative, political and social-ethical challenges for laser ignition, etc. The key terms of this proceedings include nonequilibrium plasma, multistage amplification, gasoline engine automobile, noise robust acoustic signal processing, cryogenic rocket combustion, interferometric density measurements, laser ignition, aeronautic combustion engines, pollutant emissions reduction, UV microchip lasers.",,,Conference Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035107420

Depending on the area of the country and source of ERCs, ERCs may never expire, expire after 5 years, or expire after 10 years. This can create and has created significant volatility in prices and supply in certain counties and parishes across the country. The Gulf Coast and Northeast are two areas of the US experiencing a shortage of ERCs and has seen a significant rise in ERC prices due to a reduction of supply. For example, Houston-Galveston-Brazoira (HGB) has seen VOC ERC prices increase from $5,000/ton to a high of $300,000 ton in less than three years. Baton Rouge, Louisiana ERCs have increased over 800% in VOC ERCs over a three period as well. ERCs can be a fatal flaw for a project. Some companies have moved the location of new projects due to shortage of ERCs and other companies have significantly moved up the timing of the procurement of ERCs. This trend may only continue given the forecasted tight ERC supply going forward in certain nonattainment areas. On October 1st, 2015, EPA announced the lower of the NAAQS standards from 75 ppb to 70 ppb. This is expected to significantly increase the number of counties and parishes that will be classified as nonattainment. This will increase the projects that will require ERCs for their new projects and expansions. Numerous companies that have operated in attainment areas will have to adjust to permitting and offsetting their future emissions which will increase cost and complexity to their expansions. In response to the shortage of VOC ERCs, many companies and industries are pushing for the ability to use NOx ERCCs to offset VOC emissions. This has occurred in Texas, and Louisiana has just passed a new regulation and states in the Northeast are being approached as well. The ability for companies to understand the offsetting rules, supply of ERCs, demand of ERCs, procurement and contracting of ERCs along with ERC prices will be critical for companies.

Using X-ray absorbers, the plasma electron temperature has been measured to be ∼850 eV. In our experiments, we used an optimal configuration: direct double-pass ultrashort-pulse (USP) amplification in KrF amplifier stages, with multiple laser beam fila-mentation suppression in a xenon-filled cell. The highest energy on a target was 0.25 J at a USP contrast relative to amplified spontaneous emission of ∼3 1010 for intensities and ∼3 105 for fluences. Owing to two-photon resonance in the UV spectral region, the use of xenon, with a negative nonlinear refractive index, allowed us to make the cross-sectional fluence distribution more uniform and reduce the beam divergence to 0.14 mrad (at the 10 % intensity level). Reducing the USP duration via negatively chirped pulse amplification and filamentation suppression and reducing the focal spot size on a target by using parabolic short-focus optics are expected to ensure an increase in the intensity incident on the target by one to two orders of magnitude. © 2017 Kvantovaya Elektronika and Turpion Ltd.","Amplification of subpicosecond terawatt pulses in KrF amplifiers; Interaction of intense UV pulses with targets","Carbon; Carbon nanotubes; Chirp modulation; Electron temperature; Laser beams; Refractive index; Sapphire; Yarn; Amplified spontaneous emissions; Chirped pulse amplifications; Fluence distribution; Nonlinear refractive index; Plasma electron temperatures; Subpicosecond; Two-photon resonance; UV spectral regions; Ultrashort pulses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018943751

These processes change the spatial distribution of hydrocarbon components in reservoirs and include diffusion, advection and phase change over geologic time. To better understand reservoir fluid geodynamics (RFG), a set of generalized diffusion-advection equations are proposed at isothermal conditions. The Maxwell-Stefan diffusivity in the gravitational field is integrated into the diffusion equations. Thermodynamic models are used to describe nonideality of reservoir fluids and phase separation. The generalized diffusion-advection equations are then simplified for a 1-D diffusion problem. The 1-D diffusion model is applied to the Lundin oilfield case study in Norway. The reservoir fluids are simply grouped into three pseudocomponents: gas (including solution gas), asphaltene and maltene. The Peng-Robinson equation of state is employed to estimate the parameters in the Flory-Huggins regular solution model. A ternary phase diagram including binodal and spinodal phase boundaries is computed based on the thermodynamic model. Asphaltenes are further treated as two forms: nanoaggregates and clusters in the gravitational diffusion term. The new RFG model captures the main physics of the reservoir fluid geodynamic process in the field case. Because gas (light hydrocarbon) charging from the top of the oil column leads to an increase in oil solution gas and a decrease in oil solvency capability to dissolve asphaltenes, asphaltenes are expelled downwards and accumulate at the base of the oil column. In addition, because asphaltene clusters have much bigger sizes than nanoaggregates, they increase the rate of asphaltenes accumulation at the base of the oil column over geological time. The resulting single RFG model is used to account for two adjacent reservoirs with very different fluid distributions. In fault block 1, there are large, disequilibrium gradients of solution gas and asphaltenes with little asphaltene deposition. In this fault block, the rate of diffusion is reduced by known reservoir baffles. In contrast, in fault block 2, the diffusion and asphaltene migration processes essentially went to completion yielding equilibrated solution gas and asphaltene gradients. In addition, after migration to the base of the oil column, the asphaltenes underwent phase separation with increasing solution gas. The same RFG model is used for both fault blocks but with different rates of diffusion associated with the known difference in reservoir baffling. This RFG model accounts for all measured fluid gradients and asphaltene phase separation in two fault blocks with very different distributions. In addition, the primary difference in the two adjacent reservoirs is the extent of reservoir baffling; this parameter created a factor of ten difference in production rates from these fault blocks. This new fluid modeling accounting for the reservoir fluid geodynamic processes in reservoirs is shown to impact major production concerns. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Asphaltene gradients; Asphaltene instability; Diffusion; Gas charge; Gravitational field; Phase equilibrium; Tar mat","Advection; Biodegradation; Diffusion; Diffusion in liquids; Equations of state; Faulting; Gases; Geodynamics; Geology; Gravitation; Gravitational effects; Hydrocarbons; Maxwell equations; Oil fields; Oil well completion; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Phase equilibria; Phase separation; Separation; Thermodynamic properties; Asphaltene gradients; Asphaltene instability; Gas charge; Gravitational fields; Tar mats; Asphaltenes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026478560

Meanwhile, taxation is the essential economic leverage for the government to impose macro-control over the market. In view of this, China's tax scheme on domestic automotive industry was examined thoroughly and the corresponding impacts were analyzed through case study, scenario analysis and international comparison. It was found that China's automotive tax scheme has inadequate influence on the market concerning energy conservation and emission reduction, with limited incentives posed to low-engine-displacement vehicles. Besides, China's automotive tax is over-assigned to producing and purchasing phases and the tax revenue distribution pattern is not reasonable as well. Therefore, adjustment in automotive tax scheme is of vital importance in the future to pursue a sustainable development. It is suggested and prospected that China's automotive tax scheme be reformed in several aspects, including giving more preferences to low-engine-displacement vehicles, balancing taxes well in different phases, putting principles of 'ownership encouraged and usage rationalized', 'earmarking taxes' and 'burdening beneficiaries' into practice.","Automotive industry; Emission reduction; Energy conservation; Taxation reform","Automobile engines; Automotive industry; Commerce; Economics; Emission control; Energy conservation; Engines; Information management; Innovation; Piston displacement; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Taxation; Current situation; Emission reduction; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Engine displacement; Industrial upgrading; International comparison; Potential problems; Scenario analysis; Industrial economics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029768190

In order to deal with these problems, a universal thought called 'sustainable development' has made since the last forty years and international communities have provided many strategies including changing approaches in lifestyle to complete it. Now with the ruling condition in the world and the country, it is appropriate to use nonrenewable resources in certain places and to think of providing energy through sustainable methods and also to attempt to prevent energy from being wasted. Therefore, Iran's traditional architecture which possesses exclusive features meets the climatic need of every region in addition to paying attention to the environment protection and aesthetic issues. © Medwell Journals, 2017.","Designing residential complex; Green architecture; Population; Protection; Sustainable architecture approach",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028514906

In particular, impermeable surfaces and the removal of vegetation reduce the ability to intercept, store and infiltrate rainwater. Consequently, the volume of stormwater runoff and the risk of local flooding rises. This is further amplified by the anticipated effects of climate change leading to an increased frequency and intensity of heavy rain events. Hence, urban adaptation strategies are required to mitigate those impacts. A nature-based solution, more and more promoted in politics and academia, is urban green infrastructure as it contributes to the resilience of urban ecosystems by providing services to maintain or restore hydrological functions. However, this poses a challenge to urban planners in deciding upon effective adaptation measures as they often lack information on the performance of green infrastructure to moderate surface runoff. It remains unclear what type of green infrastructure (e.g. trees, green roofs), offers the highest potential to reduce discharge volumes and to what extent. Against this background, this study provides an approach to gather quantitative evidence on green infrastructure's regulation potential. We use a micro-scale scenario modelling approach of different variations of green cover under current and future climatic conditions. The scenarios are modelled with MIKE SHE, an integrated hydrological simulation tool, and applied to a high density residential area of perimeter blocks in Munich, Germany. The results reveal that both trees and green roofs increase water storage capacities and hence reduce surface runoff, although the main contribution of trees lies in increasing interception and evapotranspiration, whereas green roofs allow for more retention through water storage in their substrate. With increasing precipitation intensities as projected under climate change their regulating potential decreases due to limited water storage capacities. The performance of both types stays limited to a maximum reduction of 2.4% compared to the baseline scenario, unless the coverage of vegetation and permeable surfaces is significantly increased as a 14.8% reduction is achieved by greening all roof surfaces. We conclude that the study provides empirical support for the effectiveness of urban green infrastructure as nature-based solution to stormwater regulation and assists planners and operators of sewage systems in selecting the most effective measures for implementation and estimation of their effects. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Climate change adaptation; Ecosystem services; Evapotranspiration; Green infrastructure; Stormwater management","ground water; rain; storm water; water; rain; adaptive management; assessment method; climate change; discharge; ecosystem service; evapotranspiration; flooding; greenspace; hydrological cycle; infrastructural development; mitigation; rainfall; risk factor; runoff; urban development; urban ecosystem; urban forestry; water management; Article; canopy; climate; climate change; ecosystem; evaporation; evapotranspiration; fluid balance; hydrology; precipitation; priority journal; quantitative analysis; reduction (chemistry); runoff; surface property; urban area; vegetation; city; environmental protection; Germany; procedures; theoretical model; water flow; Cities; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Germany; Hydrology; Models, Theoretical; Rain; Water Movements",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019763899

Wastewater treatment generates significant amount of greenhouse gases mainly methane and nitrous oxide. Reducing these emissions from the treatment process and the contribution of the wastewater treatment (WWT) processes to global warming are major concerns. On the other hand, WWTPs allow recovering energy, and nutrients, thus the reuse of treated wastewater in developing and developed countries can be appropriated (Anastasios and Athanasia, Managing water resources under climate uncertainty, pp 197–220, 2015; Casey, Greenhouse gas emissions from wastewater treatment plants get closer scrutiny.

Under intensive use of chemical fertilizer, the balance of organic matter is disturbed and chemical and physical properties of soil are degraded. To maintain and improve soil fertility it is necessary to import organic fertilizer periodically. Incorporation of organic material contributes to the increase of soil organic matter and preserves the quality and quantity of soil nitrogen. The lack of organic fertilizers requires seeking of alternative options. Such reserve is sludge obtained during biological wastewater treatment. Despite the existence of legislation on the use of sludge in agricultural practice, there is still mistrust among farmers for their use. The aim of the study is to establish the changes in system “soil-fertilizer-plant” as a result of fertilization with sludge. In 2006 and 2007 on selected arrays of cultivated soils of Sofia region, sludge from WWTP—Kubratovo as soil improver, accordance with the legislation was imported. Crops are corn and sunflower. The rate of sludge was calculated on the basis of chemical analysis for nitrogen content, soil differences, requirements of crops, etc. In 2013 (after 5–6 years of cultivation) the same arrays are taken as average samples and analyzed for the same chemical properties. During the whole period in this area the chemical fertilizer is not imported. The results found that the use of sludge as a soil improver does not represent environmental risk and can be used in agricultural practice to maintain and improve soil fertility and crop yields, according to legal requirements. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Balance of organic matter; Organic reserve; Sludge from WWTP","Agriculture; Biogeochemistry; Biological materials; Biological water treatment; Carbon; Chemical analysis; Crops; Cultivation; Environmental regulations; Fertilizers; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Microorganisms; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Organic compounds; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Soils; Toxicity; Wastewater reclamation; Water conservation; Water resources; Water treatment plants; Agricultural practices; Biological waste water treatment; Chemical and physical properties; Chemical fertilizers; Organic reserve; Pathogenic microorganisms; Sludge from WWTP; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994525202

Due to its unique design, the combustion process is optimized by stable and rapid injection rate profiles, which are allowing for reliable multiple injection driving strategies to further reduce the fuel consumption and in-cylinder emissions. Due to its flexible characteristics, the poppet valve is applicable in numerous fields. Two applications are specifically presented in this paper. The first application of the poppet valve is the common rail retrofit of a V16 GE® 7FDL locomotive engine with a power output of 4000HP. In this retrofit project, the existing mechanical fuel injection system is replaced by a common rail system. The injector design is such that no changes to the cylinder head are required. The injector includes an integrated accumulator for maximized and constant injection pressures during the whole injection process. Each cylinder bank is equipped with its own slim rail attached to the engine structure and a dedicated high pressure pump, allowing for a freely configurable injection event up to 1600bar. The resulting significant reduction of fuel consumption over the locomotive duty cycle as well as emissions reductions are discussed in detail in this paper. The poppet valve is also successfully applied in the field of micro pilot injection for new dual fuel engines, in the marine and power-gen sectors, as a second application of this injector design principle. On these engines, the micro pilot injection quantity to ignite the gas is typically 0.5-2% of the total energy input. This maximized diesel fuel substitution is possible because of the accurate switching characteristics of the poppet valve at smallest injection quantities. With the application of the proprietary Wave Dynamics and Dampening System (WDD) [1] and injector-integrated accumulators, the rail can be replaced completely by so-called jumper lines, while maintaining a slim outer shape on the overall injector size.

Communications often receive less attention yet are critical to managing adverse outcomes of climate change by emphasizing human and technological interfaces. Several cases of communication failures and ultimate successes in extreme events are diagnosed uniquely using network concepts. In these cases, communications influenced the magnitude and direction of consequences and illustrate successful learning efforts and best practices across disciplines to address communication deficiencies. The overarching research question is how two critical components of risk communication—messaging and the adequacy of communication technology—can be shaped to support adaptations to climate change to reduce its adverse consequences. Messaging and technologies act together at human-technology interfaces. One case involved the interplay of communication technology, human capacity for understanding warnings, and mortality in a record mid-West tornado, and improvements were recommended at human and technological interfaces for more effective communication. A second case involved communications among weather scientists, government operators, system users, and other groups about transit services in a severe New York City snowstorm, and learning from those experiences contributed to reduced human exposures and addressed operational changes for transit services in subsequent storms. A third case addressed communication failures in getting services to New York City’s populations in record-breaking storm-related flooding of the New York City subway system, which resulted in recommendations about information access and accuracy. The methodological approach follows case-based research techniques supported by network concepts. These failures and the lessons learned provide key, transferrable strategies and methodologies for climate change adaptation in terms of a multi-disciplinary, network approaches for communication. Although many of the analyses emphasize technology for communications improvements, these are embedded in a larger framework of societal and inter-organizational networks that reflect human-technological interfaces. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Adaptation; Climate change; Extreme events; Infrastructure; Risk communication",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071508133

The inclusion of plasma power deposition to the flame region initiates rapid decomposition of flow constituents driven by electron-impact processes as well as interactions with electronically-excited neutral species produced in the plasma. The objective of the current work is to leverage progressing experimental efforts to provide validation for simulations of plasma-assisted combustion (PAC). The multiphysics simulation capability brings together modules for various important aspects: fluid dynamics, turbulence modeling, electric field coupling, transport models for neutrals and charged species, as well as a detailed reaction mechanism for air-plasma and combustion chemistry. The corresponding experimental work provides various validation data from plasma-assisted combustion flames in air:CH4 mixtures including OH planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) measurements, Raleigh scattering thermometry (RST), particle image velocimetry (PIV) of the reactor flow field, and spectroscopy of nitrogen emissions in the flame. Recent work has identified swirlstabilized and PAC cases to be used for validation of simulation work.

New mobility technologies in the transport sector such as electric vehicles (EV) can reduce these emissions substantially. However, a growing number of EV equipped with lithium-based traction batteries will most likely require large quantities of materials such as lithium. Associated with increasing amounts of EV batteries in use is the issue of handling obsolete batteries at the end of their lifetime. Recycling of End-of-Life-batteries is vital to cope with a rising demand for battery materials in terms of energy and resource savings as well as securing raw material supply. But, the recovery of valuable materials during battery recycling processes is a matter of costs. Here we assess the possibilities and conditions for lithium recycling from retired EV batteries in a prospective manner by applying dynamic material flow analysis to the global lithium cycle. In this regard, we also evaluate how potential trends in future raw material prices may impact lithium recycling. We found out that only with a strong price increase for primary lithium, the recovery of lithium from battery recycling processes will become competitive within the next ten years. This underlines the need for strategies to improve the cost-efficiency of lithium recycling. In this context, we discuss options to promote the profitability of lithium recycling from EV batteries, focusing on cities since there are incentives for an increasing use of EV such as emission reductions and infrastructures for a widespread adoption of electric mobility in urban traffic as well. Furthermore, cities provide opportunities for battery use beyond EV through the combined development of decentralized renewable energy sources and smart grids. © EDP Sciences, 2018.","Battery lifecycle; Electric vehicles; Lithium recycling; Material flow analysis; Modeling; Price and production trends; Smart cities","Climate change; Electric vehicles; Electronic Waste; Emission control; Lithium; Recycling; Renewable energy resources; Smart power grids; Critical analysis; Dynamic materials; Emission reduction; End-of-life batteries; Raw material prices; Raw material supply; Renewable energy source; Sustainable cities; Lithium batteries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114772979

But SHW is unstable due to changing outdoor climate, which needs auxiliary heat source to meet continuous hot water demand. Despite previous studies have proposed the suitable solar fraction in different regions of China, the reasonable auxiliary heat source form in different regions should be somewhat different due to geographic variations and local conditions, and needs further study. This paper analyzes the adaptability of the auxiliary heat source s in different regions, which helps to guide the applications of SHW in China. The optimal solar fraction and regional adaptability of auxiliary heat source from aspects of energy efficiency, economic performance and carbon emission reduction during the life cycle in 31 capital cities in China are discussed by using Geographical Information System (GIS) mapping techniques and RETScreen tool. The residential solar hot water system based model is developed, and the geographic variations in the solar resource, supply water temperature, local energy price, hot water usage, and available incentives are selected for analysis. The results show that the suitable auxiliary heat source form and optimized solar fraction vary in different regions. For example, towngas boosted SHW is appropriate for most regions especially in the west region of China. The heat pump boosted SHW is a good choice in the southern coast region.

The planning model including EPP has obvious advantages considering pollutant and carbon emission constraints, which confirms the advantages of low cost and emissions of EPP. The construction of progressive IRP models for power resources considering EPP has a certain reference value for guiding the planning and layout of EPP within other power resources and achieving cost and environmental objectives. © 2017 Yiping Zhu et al.",,"Costs; Energy efficiency; Carbon constraints; Effective planning; Efficiency power plants (EPP); Environmental constraints; Environmental objectives; Planning and layouts; Reference values; Supply and demand; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017113588

Understanding the driving forces behind carbon emission is a prerequisite for reducing carbon emissions and finding a balance between economic growth and carbon emissions. The purpose of this paper is to identify the impact of the factors which influence the level of carbon emissions from the transportation sector in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) area, China, using decomposition model, combined with a decoupling elasticity index. The results of our study indicate that: (1) changes in the level of carbon emissions from the transportation sector are not always synchronized with changes in economic growth. (2) The decoupling state between the carbon emissions and economic growth of Tianjin and Beijing can be roughly divided into two phases. The first phase was during the 2005 to 2009 period, when the decoupling state was pessimistic. The second phase was from 2009 to 2013, when the decoupling state became better overall and was mainly dominated by weak decoupling. Conversely, the decoupling state of Hebei was mainly weak during this period. (3) Economic growth and population size play positive roles in increasing the levels of transportation-related carbon emissions in BTH. However, the energy structure is a negative force. The effect of energy intensity always plays a negative role in Tianjin and Hebei, but positive in Beijing. The industrial structure effect shows a fluctuating trend, but the cumulative effect value is negative, and negative interaction is prominent. Finally, this paper gives some suggestions on how to develop low-carbon transport in BTH area. © 2017 by the authors.","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) area; Decoupling analysis; Influencing factors; Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index Method; Transportation sector","carbon emission; decomposition analysis; economic growth; emission control; fuel consumption; greenhouse gas; index method; industrial structure; population size; transportation system; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019149846

Monochloroacetic acid (MCA), a typical recalcitrant aliphatic halide, was previously shown to be reduced by hydrated electrons (eaq), requiring 254 nm irradiation. Here, we demonstrate the efficient hydrogenation of MCA to acetic acid (HOAc) with high selectivity using TiO2 electrons accumulated under the bandgap (3.2 eV) excitation in the presence of methanol as a hole scavenger. The reaction occurs via a single electron transfer in concert with C-Cl cleavage (concerted dissociative electron transfer, DET) to give [rad]CH2COOH, which is then subjected to the subsequent 1e−/1H+ process to give HOAc. The in situ visible and infrared spectroscopic characterizations reveal the critical role of localized TiIII states in C-Cl activation, whereas conduction band or shallow trapped electrons are not active in this process. The photocatalytic reduction rate slowed down with an increase in the intervening carbon atoms (monohalogenated propionic and butyric acids) between TiO2 surface and the C-X bond, which is attributed to the decrease in the electron transfer driving force. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon-halogen bond activation; Dissociative electron transfer; Monochloroacetic acid; Photocatalytic dehalogenation; Titanium dioxide","Butyric acid; Chemical activation; Chloroacetic acid; Dissociation; Electron transitions; Electrons; Propionic acid; Titanium dioxide; Carbon-halogen bond; Dissociative electron transfers; Infrared spectroscopic; Monochloroacetic acid; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic reduction; Reductive activation; Single electron transfer; Photodissociation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026462350

Many simple analytical and semi-analytical techniques have been proposed to support screening analysis and performance assessment for potential carbon sequestration sites. However, these analytical techniques have ignored the capillary trapping mechanism, which is important to the carbon sequestration in aquifers. In this paper, a new analytical method to evaluate the saturation profile and CO2 trapped quantity was derived. First, the fractional theory (Buckley-Leverett type model) is applied to simulate the multiphase flow. And the trapping and hysteresis models are adopted to model the capillary trapping mechanism. Then, the transient-pressure solution of injection well was solved by applying the quasi-steady state theory. Subsequently, this analytical method is applied to evaluate the saturation profile and CO2 trapped quantity when gas alternating water (GAW) injection (strong imbibition phenomenon). After that, we applied this new analytical method in a real case to evaluate the CO2 capillary trapped quantity and assess the saturation profile. Finally, model verification and sensitivity analysis were conducted. The results of model verification show satisfactory match and justifies, which shows our methodology is reasonable. Furthermore, the CO2 trapped quantity can account for about 24.25% of total trapped quantity, which indicates that the capillary trapping can't be ignored for long-term storage. In addition, results of sensitive analysis show that as the residual gas saturation increases, the capillary trapping capacity increases. This work provides a new approach to the quick assessment of the capillary trapping quantity and the location of mobile gas left during gas alternating water injection.",,"Aquifers; Carbon; Hydrogeology; Hysteresis; Injection (oil wells); Sensitivity analysis; Water injection; Carbon sequestration; Gas alternating waters; Performance assessment; Quasi-steady state theory; Residual gas saturation; Semi-analytical techniques; Transient pressures; Trapping mechanisms; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050360253

Many simple analytical and semi-analytical techniques have been proposed to support screening analysis and performance assessment for potential carbon sequestration sites. However, these analytical techniques have ignored the effect of fracture occurrences, which are important to the carbon sequestration in shale formation. In this paper, numerical simulation technology is applied to model different complex hydraulic fracture occurrences and evaluate the CO2 seepage rule during carbon sequestration. First, multi-component Langmuir isotherm is applied to simulate the adsorption desorption phenomenon of CO2. Combining Langmuir isotherm with the reservoir parameters of Barnett shale formation, shale reservoir simulation model is constructed to simulate the CO2 seepage law during the CO2 sequestration. Then, based on the shale reservoir simulation model, local grid refinement technology is used to characterize the five typical fracture occurrences caused by hydraulic fracturing. Subsequently, the numerical simulation cases with five different fracture occurrences are run to evaluate the performance during CO2 storage process. Finally, some critical important parameters, including engineering and geologic parameters, are evaluated through the sensitivity study. In order to identify and illustrate the performance which progressively occur over time, the log-log plot of CO2 injection rate versus time is adopted. The simulation results indicate that the flow regimes of CO2 injection can be classified into eight flow regions. Among these flow regions, the inner boundary dominated flow regime is a unique one which can occur only when realizing strongly stimulated reservoir volume. Further, the sensitivity study indicates that the fracture topologies and the primary fracture conductivity are the two key factors dominating the early-time flow behavior during the carbon sequestration. And the finaltime flow behavior is dominated by the shale reservoir parameters. This work systematically analyzes the effect of fracture topologies on carbon sequestration and enlarges our knowledge of CO2 storage in shale gas systems.

To reduce the emission of PAHs, it's significant and indispensable to explore the PAH formation mechanism. In the present work, the growth mechanism of PAHs from the reactions of anthracene and phenanthrene with cyclopentadienyl and indenyl radicals was investigated with the aid of high-accuracy quantum chemistry calculation. The rate constants of key elementary steps were calculated by meaning of the canonical variation transition-state (CVT) theory with the small curvature tunneling (SCT) correction over the temperature range of 400–1400 K. The mechanism of the PAH formation involves in six elementary steps, addition reaction, ring closure, intramolecular H-shift, cleavage of C[sbnd]C bond, intramolecular H-shift and unimolecular elimination of CH3 or H. The cleavage of C[sbnd]C bond is the rate-determining step due to the high barrier. The formation of PAHs from the reactions of anthracene with cyclopentadienyl and indenyl radicals is easier than that from the reactions of phenanthrene. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Anthracene; Cyclopentadienyl; Formation reactions; Indenyl; PAH growth mechanism; Phenanthrene","Addition reactions; Mineral oils; Quantum chemistry; Rate constants; Cyclopentadienyls; Formation reaction; Indenyl; PAH growth; Phenanthrene; Anthracene; anthracene; aromatic hydrocarbon; chemical compound; cyclopentadienyl; indenyl; phenanthrene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; radical; unclassified drug; anthracene derivative; organometallic compound; phenanthrene derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; chemical compound; chemical process; chemical reaction; correction; formation mechanism; PAH; phenanthrene; temperature profile; toxic substance; addition reaction; Article; calculation; chemical analysis; chemical bond; chemical reaction; quantum chemistry; reaction analysis; regulatory mechanism; ring closing metathesis; small curvature tunneling; temperature; chemical model; chemistry; Anthracenes; Models, Chemical; Organometallic Compounds; Phenanthrenes; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029584025

It still remains a technical difficulty on achieving an effective and stable combustion for residual carbon in China or abroad. As early as 2004, the Institute of Engineering Thermophysics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, put forward the technical route of combustion with fuel preheating, that is to realize a high efficient combustion of low-volatile fuel based on the principle of preheating enhances combustion. In the decades from 2004 to 2014, a series of test platforms were built with different capacities of 30kW, 0.2MW and 2MW, on which a lot of experiments were carried out. Consequently, the preheating mechanism of low-volatile fuels including anthracite and gasified residual carbon, the high efficient combustion method of preheated fuel and the strategy of controlling pollutant emissions, were all obtained. In 2015, the demonstration project of 100 tons/day gasified residual carbon was built in Hechi city, Gaungxi Province. The raw material of the boiler, the solid residue of coal gasification in circulating fluidized bed, contains 0.64% of volatile and 60% of ash with the heat value of 3000 kcal/kg. The combustion heat of gasified residual carbon is used to generate the saturated steam with the pressure of 3.82 MPa and the temperature of 250 °C. This paper mainly describes the design parameters, technical process, flow field and commission characteristics of 100 tons/day gasified residual carbon boiler, providing a technical route and solution schemes for high efficient and clean combustion of low or ultra-low volatile fuels.","Demonstration project; Gasified residual carbon; Preheating combustion","Boilers; Carbon; Coal combustion; Coal gasification; Demonstrations; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Preheating; Residual fuels; Basic characteristics; Chinese Academy of Sciences; Circulating fluidized bed; Combustion technology; Demonstration project; Engineering thermophysics; Residual carbon; Technical difficulties; Fluidized bed combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052311769

Commercialized deNOx systems, NOx storage and reduction (NSR) and selective catalytic reduction (SCR), function well from ∼250 °C to ∼400 °C, but have unsatisfactory performance outside that temperature range. Toyota researchers recently invented a new deNOx system, Di-Air (diesel NOx aftertreatment by adsorbed intermediate reductants), which involves fast injection of fuel into the exhaust feed to the NSR converter [1]. Previous studies show that ceria increases the deNOx performance of the Di-Air system in both low [2] and high [3] temperature regions. Data suggest that NOx conversion occurs via the reaction of an intermediate produced through the reaction with O2 and NO [1, 2]. However, a recent study [3] suggests that catalysts containing ceria may involve an alternative pathway of NOx abatement via NO decomposition at high temperatures. We studied in a bench-scale flow reactor system the NO decomposition and reduction on ceria under different frequencies with CO as sole reductant. In our study, a lean to rich feed time ratio 6 to 1 of was controlled to keep the same fuel penalty (fuel to oxidant ratio). The lean/rich cycling conditions included lean/rich times (in seconds) of 90/15, 60/10, 30/5 and 6/1. Different reaction conditions were applied to study NO conversion behavior under favorable and adverse conditions. 500 ppm NO was added to both rich phase and lean phase. 2.5% CO was only added to rich phase and O2 with varied concentration was only added to lean phase. In some cases, CO2 and H2O were introduced continuously along with NO, O2 and CO to simulate lean exhaust. © 2017 AIChE.

This extraordinary phosphor can exhibit strong far-red emission with a maximum peak at 715 nm between 650 and 750 nm, and other four shoulder peaks at 680, 689, 698 and 706 nm, which can be ascribed to 2Eg → 2Ag spin-forbidden transition of Mn4+.

Annual baseline CO exhibited statistically significant decreasing trends (−4.3 to −2.3 ppbv yr−1), while baseline O3 did not display trends at any site. In examining the data by season, wintertime and springtime baseline CO at the two highest sites (1.5 km and 2 km asl) did not experience significant trends. Decadal increasing trends (∼2.55 ppbv yr−1) were found in springtime and wintertime baseline O3 in southern New Hampshire, which was associated with anthropogenic NOx emission reductions from the urban corridor. Biomass burning emissions impacted summertime baseline CO with ∼38% variability from wildfire emissions in Russia and ∼22% from Canada at five sites and impacted baseline O3 at the two high elevation sites only with ∼27% variability from wildfires in both Russia and Canada. The Arctic Oscillation was negatively correlated with summertime baseline O3, while the North Atlantic Oscillation was positively correlated with springtime baseline O3.

The application of water saving techniques is an effective solution to seasonal drought; it can lead to a nationwide increase in the sown area by 3.48 percent and in the grain production by 4.15 percent. Introducing new varieties will increase grain outputs and change the spatial distribution of crop production across the country. The combination of promoting water-saving irrigation and new variety adoption will increase the national grain production by 19.6 percent, and thus constitute an effective approach to offsetting the negative effects of climate change on grain production.

Therefore, a precise study of forecasting carbon emissions is important as regards curbing them. To identify the influence factors of carbon emissions and effectively predict carbon emissions under the three different GDP growth rate scenarios in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei thermal power industry, we employed a combination of the improved particle swarm optimization-back propagation algorithm (IPSO-BP) with scenario prediction. The results are as follows: 1) The influencing degree of carbon emissions factors from strong to weak are the installed capacity of thermal power, thermal power generation, urbanization rate, GDP, and utilization ratio of units (with grey correlation degrees of 0.9262, 0.9247, 0.8683, 0.8082, and 0.7704, respectively). 2) Compared with the BP neural network, it is testified that using the IPSO-BP neural network model with an annual average relative error of 2.53%, while the prediction precision of BP neural network is 5.07%. Besides, the number of iterations to achieve the optimal solution is approximately reduced by 33%. 3) GDP is the contributor to the increment of carbon emissions of the power industry, whereby GDP growth rate can be reduced appropriately to curb carbon emissions, avoiding excessive pursuit of economic growth. © 2017, HARD Publishing Company.

The major advantage of the system lies in the multiple functions of providing energy for space heating in winter and domestic hot water in other seasons, and generating electricity annually to balance the electricity demand of the system. Compared to traditional flat-plate solar collectors, the mini-channel solar thermal and PV/T panels have the smaller cross-sectional area, higher fluid flow velocity and thus higher heat transfer rate between the heat-carrying fluid and panel walls, thus leading to enhanced solar thermal and electrical efficiencies. It is found that during the typical-day testing, the mini-channel thermal panels had average solar efficiency of 50.8%; while the mini-channel PV/T panels had average solar efficiency of 45.0% and the whole system had average Coefficient of Performance (COP) of 4.9. The system made use of solar and gas sources with the fractional solar consumption of 44%, while its operation was under the pre-set time schedule, i.e., solar panels on from 9:00 to 6:00, heat pump on from 18:00 and 20:00, and gas heater on from 22:00 to 9:00. Throughout the testing period, the room temperature was maintained at above 18 °C, thus enabling achieving the required thermal comfort. Concerning the complexity of such a system, a simplified system comprising the mini-channel thermal and PV/T panels and a heat pump was suggested. In brief, the research has produced fundamental data for the mini-channel-based solar thermal and PV/T panels and established a foundation for designing a simple and low-cost mini-channel based solar space heating system for rural houses in cold climatic regions of China, which will subsequently contribute to significant fossil fuel saving and carbon emission reduction in the global extent. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Heat pump; Mini-channel; PV/T panel; Solar thermal panel","Coefficient of performance; Collector efficiency; Emission control; Flow of fluids; Flow velocity; Fossil fuels; Fuel economy; Heat pump systems; Heating equipment; Pumps; Solar heating; Carbon emission reductions; Coefficient of performances (COP); Flat-plate solar collectors; Heat pumps; Mini channels; Operational performance; PV/T panel; Solar thermal; Space heating; carbon emission; electricity generation; flow velocity; fluid flow; fossil fuel; heat transfer; heating; performance assessment; photovoltaic system; solar power; thermal power; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021442967

A multi-method approach, adopting different analytical and receptor modeling methods, was employed to determine the relative abundances of region-specific air pollution constituents and contributions of emission sources. This paper is focused on organic molecular marker based source apportionment using chemical mass balance (CMB) receptor modeling. Analyses of the organic molecular markers revealed that vehicle emission, coal combustion, biomass burning, meat cooking and natural gas combustion were the major contributors to organic carbon (OC) in PM2.5. The vehicle emission dominated the sources contributing to OC in spring at four sampling sites. During wintertime, the coal combustion had highest contribution to OC at BTH site, while the major source contributing to OC at YRD and PRD sites was vehicle emission. In addition, the relative contributions of different emission sources to PM2.5 mass at a specific location site and in a specific season revealed seasonal and spatial variations across all four sampling locations. The largest contributor to PM2.5 mass was secondary sulfate (14–17%) in winter at the four sites. The vehicle emission was found to be the major source (14–21%) for PM2.5 mass at PRD site. The secondary ammonium has minor variation (4–5%) across the sites, confirming the influences of regional emission sources on these sites. The distinct patterns of seasonal and spatial variations of source apportionment observed in this study were consistent with the findings in our previous paper based upon water-soluble ions and carbonaceous fractions.

Therefore, the eastern region should give full play to its own technological advantages and regional advantages, and improve the efficiency of low-carbon innovation, but also actively promote the development direction of low input, high output and low pollution in the central and western regions.","Data envelopment analysis; Efficiency of energy saving; Innovation efficiency; Regional analysis","Data envelopment analysis; Emission control; Energy conservation; Pollution; Regional planning; Regression analysis; Development directions; Energy saving and emission reductions; Environmental pollution problem; Industrial enterprise; Innovation efficiency; Innovation mechanisms; Regional analysis; Spatial econometric models; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037809366

A port blocker was designed on intake manifold so as to generate intake tumble, and then the sweeping test of excess air coefficient was conducted under engine common conditions (2000 r/min, 2.6 bar) in two port blocker states (opening and closing). On this basis, the effects of lean combustion coupling with intake tumble on the working process, combustion and emission performance of gasoline engine were studied. The tested results indicate that lean combustion limit is obviously extended with acceptable combustion stability by utilizing intake tumble, thus the potential of energy conservation and emission reduction by lean combustion can be further enhanced. Compared with the initial state of original engine (λ = 1.0, port blocker closing), the indicated thermal efficiency can be increased by 7.2%, and the specific emissions of CO2, CO, HC and NOX can be reduced by 5.8%, 72.2%, 12.0% and 85.3% at most, respectively. In particular, the minimum specific emission of NOX is only 2.0 g/(kW·h).

In addition, there are growing interest to use such high power 808nm lasers in the field of automotive infra-red (IR) illumination and medical aesthetic treatment. Vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) have emerged as a promising candidate and attracted increased interests for those applications, due to their combined advantages of high efficiency, low diverging circular beam, narrow emission spectrum with reduced temperature sensitivity, low-cost manufacturability, simpler coupling optics, and increased reliability, especially at high temperatures. They can emit very high power with very high power density as they can be conveniently configured into large two-dimensional arrays and modules of arrays. We report recent development on such high-power, high-efficiency 808nm VCSELs with industrial leading ∼55% power conversion efficiency (PCE). Top emitting VCSELs were grown by MOCVD and processed into single devices and 2D arrays using selective wet oxidation process and substrate removal technique for efficient current confinement and heat removal. Peak PCE of 51% and peak power of 800W were achieved from 5x5mm array, corresponding to peak power density of ∼4kW/cm2.

This study examines the potential changes in the frost-free season length between historical (1971-2000) and future (2041-2070) periods over the contiguous USA with a focus on spatial variability and the uncertainties surrounding the projections, using daily minimum temperature outputs from a 6-member ensemble composed of 3 regional-climate models nested within 3 general-circulation models provided by the North American Regional Climate Change Assessment Program (NARCCAP). Despite broad agreement among ensemble members on future advance (delay) of last spring (first autumn) frost and thus an increase in the frost-free season length across the USA, large inter-model spread, an indication of high uncertainties, exists especially over the mountainous West. The uncertainty surrounding the first autumn frost is the major contributor to the high uncertainty in the projected frost-free season length for the West, in contrast to other regions, especially the Great Plains, where the ensemble spread in the last spring frost contributes more to the season-length uncertainty. The lengthening is not symmetric in spring and autumn, and the asymmetry, which varies by region and model, is relatively small in the eastern and central USA, and large in the western USA. Across California and portions of the Southwest, the advance in the last spring frost will be more than the delay in the first autumn frost. Elsewhere in the western USA, especially over high terrain, the frost-free season will lengthen more in autumn than in spring. © Inter-Research 2017.","Climate change impact; Ensemble projection; Frost dates; Frost-free season; Growing season; NARCCAP","adaptation; agricultural production; climate change; climate modeling; ecosystem management; frost; future prospect; general circulation model; growing season; mountain region; regional climate; seasonal variation; uncertainty analysis; California; Great Plains; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020468272

A high surface loading of NO3 − gave significant and irreversible inhibition of Cr(VI) reduction. At a surface loading of 500 mg Cr/m2-d, the Cr(VI)-removal percentage was 100% when NO3 − was absent (Stage 1), but was dramatically lowered to &lt; 25% with introduction of 280 mg N m−2-d NO3 − (Stage 2). After ∼50 days operation in Stage 2, the Cr(VI) reduction recovered to only ∼70% in Stage 3, when NO3 − was removed from the influent; thus, NO3 − had a significant long-term inhibition effect on Cr(VI) reduction. Weighted PCoA and UniFrac analyses proved that the introduction of NO3 − had a strong impact on the microbial community in the biofilms, and the changes possibly were linked to the irreversible inhibition of Cr(VI) reduction. For example, Meiothermus, the main genus involved in Cr(VI) reduction at first, declined with introduction of NO3 −. The denitrifier Chitinophagaceae was enriched after the addition of NO3 −, while Pelomonas became important when nitrate was removed, suggesting its potential role as a Cr(VI) reducer. Moreover, introducing NO3 − led to a decrease in the number of genes predicted (by PICRUSt) to be related to chromate reduction, but genes predicted to be related to denitrification, methane oxidation, and fermentation increased. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Chromate reduction; Membrane biofilm reactor; Methane; Microorganism; Nitrate","Biofilms; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Genes; Methane; Microorganisms; Nitrates; Chromate reductions; Delivery capacity; Electron donors; Inhibition effect; Irreversible inhibitions; Membrane biofilm reactor; Methane oxidation; Microbial communities; Chromates; chromic acid; cytochrome c 551; cytochrome c 561; cytochrome c containing subunit II; ferredoxin hydrogenase; ferredoxin nitrate reductase; ferredoxin nitrite reductase; formate dehydrogenase; glutathione reductase; methane; methane monooxygenase; methanol dehydrogenase; nitrate; nitrate reductase; nitrite reductase; nitroreductase; nitrous oxide reductase; thioredoxin reductase; unclassified drug; methane; nitric acid derivative; bacterium; biofilm; bioreactor; chromate; denitrification; electron; fermentation; gene expression; methane; microbial activity; microbial community; microbial ecology; nitrate; oxidation; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; Betaproteobacteria; biofilm reactor; chemical reaction; Chitinophagaceae; community structure; concentration (parameters); Deinococci; denitrification; enzyme conformation; fermentation; high throughput sequencing; Meiothermus; membrane biofilm reactor; metagenomics; microbial community; molecular phylogeny; nonhuman; oxidation; Pelomonas; priority journal; shear stress; stoichiometry; surface property; waste component removal; biofilm; bioreactor; oxidation reduction reaction; Meiothermus; Pelomonas; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Chromates; Methane; Nitrates; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014354340

Given their geopolitical importance, they lead to the intensification of competition between the countries in the region and nonregional states. The new pipelines may not only create additional opportunities for the delivery of oil and natural gas from Central Asia to external markets, but also fundamentally change the balance of power in the region. This explains the increase of the role of the hydrocarbon resources in the external policy of the Central Asian countries and their closer attention to the pipeline method of transportation. In the last twenty-five years, the countries of Central Asia have made considerable progress in the establishment of a new system of pipelines. The implementation of pipeline projects in the region was closely linked to the production of hydrocarbon raw materials, since the emergence of additional volumes of oil and gas in the Central Asian countries had raised the issue of delivery to external markets. This has become a key task of foreign policy of the countries of Central Asia rich in hydrocarbon resources. As a result, the energy policy of the countries of the region have demonstrated that, despite the construction of new pipelines, which negated the monopoly of Russia’s export of hydrocarbons to external markets, the Central Asian states were unable to reduce their dependence on the policy of the neighboring states, which act as transit countries or consumers of crude oil and natural gas. Moreover, the countries of Central Asia have been closely tied to the energy interests of China, Iran and Russia, which were able to exert their influence on the states of the region by pricing mechanisms and volumes of purchases of hydrocarbon resources. The policies of the countries of Central Asia to diversify the pipeline routes have come to depend on the rates of extracting crude oil and natural gas reserves. The current situation with filling the pipelines with the required volumes of energy resources, designated for export, has demonstrated that the ability of the countries of Central Asia to significantly expand volumes of extraction of hydrocarbon resources in the shortest possible time turned out to be limited. Numerous enthusiastic projections of oil and gas production, made in the 1990s, have subsequently been lowered. As a result, a large part of the Central Asian pipelines does not operate at full capacity. On the one hand, the reasons for this were caused by the decline in production of the old oil fields, while the development of the new fields required considerable investment and the application of new technologies, which the country did not have. As a result, the lack of financial resources and equipment required a much longer time for construction of oil and gas exporting pipelines. On the other hand, the countries of Central Asia have become increasingly susceptible to geopolitical changes, fluctuations of prices in the world markets and changes in the policies of the neighboring states. Lifting sanctions on Iran and Iran’s revision of its policy in the sphere of production and export of hydrocarbons, the unstable situation in Afghanistan, the reduction of interest on the part of Russia and China in obtaining additional volumes of hydrocarbon resources—all this had influenced the energy sector of the Central Asian countries. In spite of the difficulties, the countries of the region have not abandoned the implementation of their projects for the construction of new pipelines, considering them to be additional opportunities for the export of hydrocarbon resources and the strengthening of their geopolitical positions. © 2017, CA and CC Press AB.

Five entities of the international law appeared on the shores of the Caspian.1 Almost immediately, there emerged a problem of defining the status of the Caspian Sea. Russo-Persian and Soviet-Iranian agreements, in spite of the centuries-old history, did not determine the international legal status of the Caspian Sea and, therefore, did not regulate questions of subsoil resources’ utilization. The need for regulating the development of mining in the Caspian region was absent during the period of the U.S.S.R. since all of the Caspian Soviet republics were subjects to its unified code of laws. Furthermore, in contrast to the 19th century, when the output of the Caspian region’s oil fields had an impact on the world oil market, in the 20th century, the center of oil production began to shift to other regions of the Soviet Union. Accordingly, the interest in the Caspian region and its hydrocarbon resources was sharply reduced. The question of the international legal status of the Caspian Sea arose immediately after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and was caused by discrepancies in the national interests of the states of the Caspian region, as well as the lack of legal measures that would be adhered to by all the countries of the region and which could serve as the basis for determining the international legal status of the Caspian Sea. The New Independent states (NIS) of the Caspian region were not parties to the previous treaties, which did not meet their political and economic aspirations. The discovery of large oil and natural gas deposits in the Caspian Sea had posed not only a question of the definition of its international status, but also the question of how to divide the Caspian natural resources. The earlier Russo-Persian (and subsequently Soviet-Iranian) treaties were concerned only with issues of regulating navigation and fishing and did not affect the questions of exploration, extraction, and transportation of crude oil and natural gas by installing pipelines on the bottom of the Caspian Sea, etc. Not having any historical commitments, the new Caspian countries—Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, and Turkmenistan—began to pursue a unilateral policy, in which their national interests prevailed.2 Despite the divergent positions, the Caspian countries managed to achieve bilateral and tripartite agreements on the legal status of the part of the Caspian Sea. This gave precedence for creating legal means for further development of oil and gas fields on the Caspian Sea shelf.

Here, we exposed three widely distributed cool-season C3 grass species Tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Schreb.), Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), and Kentucky bluegrass (Poa pratensis L.) to ambient (400 μmol mol-1) or elevated CO2concentrations (600, 800, 1000, and 1200 μmol mol-1) in growth chambers using an automatic CO2 controlling system. We examined growth, physiological, and biochemical responses to elevated CO2 with measurements on plant growth traits (relative growth rate and biomass), leaf gas exchange, and tissue biochemical composition (non-structural carbohydrates) of the three grass species during exposure to ambient or elevated CO2 concentrations for eight weeks. Our results showed that elevated CO2 concentrations significantly increased the averaged relative growth rates of Tall fescue and the total leaf area of Kentucky bluegrass. Meanwhile, CO2 enhancement significantly stimulated the leaf net photosynthesis rate(An) of the three species. However, both the area-based and N-based leaf dark respiration rates (Rd) of the three species were sharply decreased, and thus increased the ratio of leaf net photosynthesis and dark respiration. These results suggested that Tall fescue might be more responsive to elevated CO2in growth, physiological, and biochemical traits than the other two species, which has important implications for species composition, competition, and dynamics, and thus community structure and functionin natural and managed ecosystems under elevated CO2levels. © 2017, Pakistan Botanical Society.

Urban green space plays an important role in reducing atmospheric carbon dioxide. Quantifying the carbon stock, distribution, and change of urban green space is vital to understanding the role of urban green space in reducing anthropogenic carbon dioxide. In the present study, the correlation between field measurements at sample locations and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data extracted from Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) images was determined. Regression analysis was performed to construct a model for estimating the aboveground carbon (AGC) stock in urban green space. This model was then used to estimate the AGC stock of urban green space within the beltways of Xi'an city in 2004, 2010 and 2013. The map in temporal and spatial distributions of NDVI and the AGC stock was plotted. The AGC stock in the urban green space of Xi'an in 2004, 2010 and 2013 were 73843 t, 126621 t and 200076 t, respectively.

The results show that the selectivity to α-olefins can be fine-tuned. In detail, Co3O4 (311) is always first reduced to metallic Co (111), and then, Co (111) is carburized with CO to form Co2C (111). However, second reduction over Co2C (111) results in Co (101) and Co (002) for 15Co/SiO2-RCR. Contrary to the case of unmodified 15Co/SiO2, the addition of Mn alters the evolution of Co2C (111) into Co (101) and Co (100) for 15Co3.7Mn/SiO2-RCR. During the FTS reaction over R-treated catalysts, Co (111) remains almost unchanged for 15Co/SiO2-R, but gradually evolves into Co3C (101) over 15Co3.7Mn/SiO2-R. For comparison, 15Co3.7Mn/SiO2-RCR exhibits stable Co (101) and Co (100) in the FTS reaction. The abovementioned evolutions reflect a marked effect on catalytic performance. Co (101) and Co (002) display a notable increase in selectivity to total olefins as compared to Co (111). Furthermore, a number of experiments reveal that Co3C (101) is favorable for olefins, especially for lower olefins, with a low selectivity to methane; however, Co2C (111) shows negligible activity with undesirable high selectivity to methane. Based on the comprehensive experimental data, the selectivity to total olefins might be mainly affected not only by the Co phase state and crystal facet but also by the unpaired d orbital electron number modified with Mn and the H2/CO ratio in the feed gas, directly determining the ratio of H∗/C∗ on the catalyst surface. As an optimal result, an excellent selectivity of 74.2% to total α-olefins is obtained. In addition, α-olefin distributions can be efficiently tailored by simply changing the reaction temperature. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.",,"Binary alloys; Catalysts; Cobalt; Fischer-Tropsch synthesis; Manganese; Manganese alloys; Methane; Olefins; Catalyst surfaces; Catalytic performance; Crystal facets; High selectivity; Linear alpha olefins; Optimal results; Reaction temperature; Reduction pretreatment; Catalyst selectivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031669318

This paper explores the embodied carbon footprint of Chinese final demand from the point of view of industries. It uses the Matrix Transformation Technique (MTT) to update the input-output table series from 1992 to 2020 in China. Then, we measure the embodied carbon emissions for the period 1992-2020 from 29 industry producers to the final demand, covering urban and rural residential consumption, government consumption, fixed capital formation, and net exports. The results show that construction, other services, wholesale, retail trade, accommodation and catering, industrial machinery and equipment, transport, storage and postal services, and manufacture of foods and tobacco are the industries with the greatest carbon emissions from producers, while fixed capital formation and urban consumption are the largest emitters from the perspective of final demand. The embodied carbon emission multipliers for most of the industries are decreasing, while the total carbon emissions are increasing each year. The ratio of emissions from residential consumption in terms of total emissions is decreasing. Each industry has a different main final demand-driven influencing factor on emission and, for each type of final demand, there are different industries with higher emissions. © 2017 by the authors.","Carbon footprint; China; Input-output table series; Sectoral analysis","capital formation; carbon emission; carbon footprint; emission control; industrial emission; input-output analysis; rural area; tobacco; urban area; China; Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014839165

The relevant crop production data from 31 provinces during 1997–2014 are utilized. In order to fully reflect the energy consumption and ECR-GHG emissions in CPSs, energy balance techniques are adopted from a consumption perspective. The driving factors behind ECR-GHG emissions are identified by means of a Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index analysis at both national and provincial levels. The results are as follows: (1) The yield of China's CPS is not positively correlated with energy consumption, and China's CPS has the relatively high potential to conserve energy and reduce ECR-GHG emissions; (2) Most of China's provinces have experienced enormous growth in ECR-GHG emissions; however there are relatively significant regional disparities; (3) ECR-GHG emissions from CPSs were mostly derived directly from the consumption of chemical fertilizers and diesel oil; (4) Areal productivity is the determining factor in the growth of ECR-GHG emissions, whereas the emission coefficient and energy mix are the main inhibiting factors; (5) Energy intensity has not achieved its full potential to decrease ECR-GHG emissions.

Due to anthropogenic disturbances, the environmental factors and the fluxes of CO2 and CH4 in lake showed obvious spatial and seasonal variability; their average fluxes in summer are significantly higher than those in autumn. The fluxes in heavy pollution sites with high concentrations of nitrogen and phosphorus nutrient in summer were 3.9 times (142.14: 36.07 mg·m-2·h-1) for CO2 and 22.3 times for CH4 (6.46: 0.29) higher than those in little pollution sites. In autumn, they were 12.3 times and 7.1 times higher, respectively. Anthropogenic disturbance and heavy pollution increased their fluxes, but aquatic plants reduced the emission of CO2. Except the sampling site with flourishing lotus, most of sampling sites without aquatic plant are the emission source of CO2 and CH4. The correlation analysis, multiple stepwise regression, and redundancy analysis showed the key environmental factors for CO2 including temperature (T), pH, chemical oxygen demand (CODMn) in water, organic matter (OM), total nitrogen, and ammonia nitrogen in water and sediment. As for CH4, the key environmental factors include turbidity, oxidation-reduction potential, dissolved oxygen, CODMn, and T in water and OM and N-NH4+ in sediment. © 2017 Zhenhua Zhao et al.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039162033

However, molecules with high conjugation and a strong D-A effect tend to show weak emission due to the severe π-π interactions and twisted intramolecular charge transfer (TICT) effects. The turn-on characteristic of AIE luminogens (AIEgens) will also be lost due to the conjugation-enhanced emission in the solution state. Herein, a polyyne-bridged AIE luminogen (2TPE-4E) with long wavelength absorption and red emission has been afforded.

Removal efficiency of particulate matter (PM), the carrier of airborne pathogens, by such filtration systems has not been investigated. This field study was, therefore, conducted to evaluate the PM removal efficacy by an electrostatic air filtration system (consisting of a low-grade air filter and an electrostatic particle ionization or EPI system) installed at the inlet of a commercial high-rise hen house. Evaluation was performed in two test rounds over one-year period. Results show that average PM removal efficiencies in rounds 1 (spring to summer) and 2 (late fall to spring) were respectively 66% and 29% for PM1, 66% and 30% for PM2.5, 66% and 31% for PM4, 68% and 36% for PM10, and 68% and 45% for total PM. Removal efficiency became unstable when the EPI system was inactivated (i.e. when solely relying on the filter for PM removal). House static pressure and ventilation rate indicated considerable clogging of the filter media by dust accumulation and the need for replacement after ∼16 weeks of use in spring-to-summer time (round 1); however clogging was not an issue during the entire late fall-to-spring sampling period (round 2, 24 weeks). Appearance of the filter changed gradually as dust accumulated with time, which can be captured by image analysis and used to judge filter dirtiness and lifespan. Findings of this field study provide insight into the efficacy of PM removal by such a low-cost air filtration system, which will help egg producers in their decision-making for disease prevention strategies.","Electrostatic particle ionization; Filtration; Hen house; Particulate matter; Reduction","Decision making; Dust; Efficiency; Electrostatics; Filtration; Houses; Ionization; Particles (particulate matter); Reduction; Removal; Air filtration system; Airborne pathogens; Disease prevention; Disease transmission; Filtration systems; High-rise hen house; Particulate Matter; Removal efficiencies; Air filters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035320485

Based on various methods and data sources, Monte-Carlo simulation was applied at sector level for national inventory, and at plant level (whenever possible) for provincial and city inventories. The uncertainties of national inventory were estimated at −17–37% (expressed as 95% confidence intervals, CIs), −21–35%, −19–34%, −29–40%, −22–47%, −21–54%, −33–84%, and −32–92% for SO2, NOX, CO, TSP (total suspended particles), PM10, PM2.5, black carbon (BC), and organic carbon (OC) emissions respectively for the whole country. At provincial and city levels, the uncertainties of corresponding pollutant emissions were estimated at −15–18%, −18–33%, −16–37%, −20–30%, −23–45%, −26–50%, −33–79%, and −33–71% for Jiangsu, and −17–22%, −10–33%, −23–75%, −19–36%, −23–41%, −28–48%, −45–82%, and −34–96% for Nanjing, respectively. Emission factors (or associated parameters) were identified as the biggest contributors to the uncertainties of emissions for most source categories except iron &amp; steel production in the national inventory. Compared to national one, uncertainties of total emissions in the provincial and city-scale inventories were not significantly reduced for most species with an exception of SO2. For power and other industrial boilers, the uncertainties were reduced, and the plant-specific parameters played more important roles to the uncertainties. Much larger PM10 and PM2.5 emissions for Jiangsu were estimated in this provincial inventory than other studies, implying the big discrepancies on data sources of emission factors and activity data between local and national inventories. Although the uncertainty analysis of bottom-up emission inventories at national and local scales partly supported the “top-down” estimates using observation and/or chemistry transport models, detailed investigations and field measurements were recommended for further improving the emission estimates and reducing the uncertainty of inventories at local and regional scales, for both industrial and other sectors. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; China; Emission factor; Multi-scale emission inventories; Uncertainty","Air quality; Chemical analysis; Industrial emissions; Intelligent systems; Organic carbon; Steelmaking; Chemistry transport model; China; Confidence interval; Emission factors; Emission inventories; Pollutant emission; Total suspended particles; Uncertainty; Uncertainty analysis; black carbon; organic carbon; air quality; black carbon; bottom-up approach; emission inventory; Monte Carlo analysis; numerical model; organic carbon; particulate matter; regional pattern; spatial analysis; top-down approach; uncertainty analysis; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; Article; boiler; cement industry; China; city; combustion; energy consumption; environmental protection; industrial production; Monte Carlo method; particulate matter; priority journal; uncertainty; China; Jiangsu; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021707423

Based on measured simultaneously air pollutants and meteorological parameters, the abatement of traffic-related pollutants induced by the implemented control measures such as CO, PM2.5 and PM10 (the particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 μm and 10 μm) concentrations were firstly quantified by comparing the air quality data in urban areas with those in rural areas (uncontrolled zones). The concentrations of CO, NO2 from motor vehicles and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were shown to have significant decreases of 15%–23% during traffic control period from those measured before control period with hourly maximum CO, PM2.5, and NO2/SO2 reduction of 43%, 35% and 141.4%, respectively.

Development of oxygen carrier with high activity, good recyclability, strong resistance to carbon deposition and excellence capacity for steam splitting is highly desired for this process. The article investigated a novel and unique structure of double perovskite-type oxides La1−xSrxFeCoO6 (x = 0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) as oxygen carrier. XRD, XPS and H2-TPR technologies were adopted to characterize the physical and chemical properties of them. Meanwhile, isothermal reactions and cyclic redox reactions were carried out in a fixed-bed reactor to determine the influences of Sr-substitution on the reactivity of La1−xSrxFeCoO6. XRD results confirmed the formation of double perovskite crystal structure for all the samples, while substitution of Sr induced a certain degree of Fe/Co disorder generating oxygen vacancies and/or higher oxidation states of metal cations. Synergistic interactions between surface metal ions, such as Fe4+/Fe5+ with Co3+ which were detected by XPS, strongly enhance the reducibility of oxygen carriers. Three zones including total oxidation of methane by surface oxygen, partial oxidation of methane by lattice oxygen and carbon deposition were divided.

In order to control air pollutant emissions and ensure better air quality during the Games, the Nanjing municipal government took a series of aggressive control measures to reduce pollutant emissions in Nanjing and its surrounding cities during the Youth Olympic Games. The Air Quality Index (AQI) is an index of air quality which is used to inform the public about levels of air pollution and associated health risks. In this study, we use the AQI and air pollutant concentrations data to evaluate the effectiveness of the implementation of control measures. The results suggest that the emission reduction measures signiﬁcantly improved air quality in Nanjing. In August 2014, the mean concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O3 were 42.44 μg·m−3, 59.01 μg·m−3,11.12 μg·m−3, 31.09 μg·m−3, 0.76 mg·m−3 and 38.39 μg·m−3, respectively, and fell by 35.92%, 36.75%, 20.40%, 15.05%, 8.54%and 47.15%, respectively, compared to the prophase mean before the emission reduction. After the emission reduction, the mean concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3 increased by 20.81%, 41.84%, 22.84%, 21.16%and 60.93%, respectively, which is due to the cancellation of temporary atmospheric pollution control measures. The air pollutants diurnal variation curve during the emission reduction was lower than the other two periods, except for CO. In addition, the AQI of Nanjing and its surrounding cities showed a downward trend, compared with July 2014. The most of effective method to control air pollution is to implement the measures of regional cooperation and joint defense and control, and reduce local emissions during the polluted period, such as airborne dust, coal-burning, vehicle emissions, mobile sources and industrial production. © 2017 by the authors.","Air pollutants; Air quality; Emission reduction; Meteorological conditions; Pm2.5; Youth olympic games","Air pollution; Air quality; Coal dust; Emission control; Health risks; Industrial emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Pollution control; Public risks; Quality control; Reduction; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollutant concentrations; Air pollutant emission; Air pollutants; Atmospheric pollution; Emission reduction; Industrial production; Meteorological condition; Olympic games; Air pollution control; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; government; health risk; Olympic Games; particulate matter; urban pollution; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020293421

Therefore, carbon isotope discrimination records a wealth of environmental information, such as temperature, precipitation etc., and the predominant factor’s influence is significant. Based on this hypothesis, we determined the carbon isotope composition of Tamarix growing in the southern margin of the Taklimakan Desert where temperature and water are key growth-limiting factors. Mean annual temperature (MAT) showed a significant impact on variation in carbon isotope discrimination value (DS), but precipitation not. In multiple stepwise regression analysis, MAT was the first and the only variable selected into the prediction model of DS against MAT and precipitation, indicating that the effect of temperature on carbon isotope discrimination was predominant. The correlation between DS and the variation rate of precipitation in previous year shows that precipitation, as a major factor in arid regions, exerts a certain ""lag effect"" on the growth of Tamarix. The reconstructed MAT regression model was established according to the DS with the least squares method, the result bolster the argument that the planet’s temperatures have shifted significantly in the last half-century. © 2017, ALÖKI Kft.","Climatic factor; Precipitation; Regression model; Tamarix cone sediment laminae; Temperature",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034967658

Typical biomass burning aerosol tracers including levoglucosan (LG), Mannosan (MN), and water-soluble potassium (K+), together with other water-soluble ions and carbonaceous species were determined. The levels of biomass burning tracers dropped dramatically during the APEC period when open biomass burning activities were well controlled in North China, yet they increased sharply to even higher levels during the post-APEC period. Distinct linear regression relationships between LG and MN were found with lower LG/MN ratios from periods with much reduced open biomass burning activities. This was likely resulted from the reduced open crop residues burning and increased residential wood burning emissions, as was also supported by the simultaneous decrease in K+/LG ratio. The positive matrix factorization and air quality model simulation analyses suggested that PM2.5 concentration produced from biomass burning sources was reduced by 22% at BJ and 46% at SJZ during the APEC period compared to pre-APEC period, although they increased to higher levels after APEC mainly due to increased residential biomass burning emissions in winter heating season. Biomass burning was also found to be the most important contributor to carbonaceous species that might cause significant light extinction in this region. This study not only suggested implementing biomass burning controls measures were helpful to reduce PM2.5 in North China, but also pointed out both open crop residues burning and indoor biomass burning activities could make substantial contributions to PM2.5 and its major components in urban areas in North China. © 2017","Atmospheric aerosols; Biomass burning sources; Emission controls; Fine particulate matter; Source-apportionment analysis","Agricultural wastes; Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Crops; Emission control; Factorization; Housing; Light extinction; Tracers; Urban growth; Biomass burning emissions; Biomass-burning; Fine particulate matter; Positive Matrix Factorization; Regression relationship; Residential wood burning; Source apportionment; Water-soluble potassium; Biomass; carbon; levoglucosan; mannosan; tracer; unclassified drug; aerosol; air quality; Asian Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum; biomass burning; concentration (composition); crop residue; emission control; megacity; particulate matter; seasonal variation; source apportionment; tracer; urban site; air pollution control; air quality; Article; biomass production; China; combustion; concentration (parameters); heat; light; model; particle size; plant residue; priority journal; season; simulation; Beijing [China]; China; China; Hebei; Shijiazhuang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029391268

Here we present the experimental results of two tests for measuring P-wave velocity under ultrasonic frequencies in two different rocks (one sandstone and one tuff, respectively) during CO2 displacing brine. Both tests were performed under a high injection pressure of 10 MPa in order to control CO2 in a supercritical state. The two rock samples display differences in rock heterogeneity. The sandstone sample shows obvious layered structures with high and low porosity layers, whereas the tuff sample shows a near homogeneous structure. During the dynamic fluid displacements tests, we used X-ray CT technique to image rock interior frequently and then calculated average CO2 saturation near the local wave propagation path. The results show very different saturation-velocity relationships for the two tests. The sandstone sample gives a relationship that is close to Gassmann-Hill limit, whereas the tuff sample gives a relationship located near the Gassmann-Wood limit. Meanwhile, X-ray CT images show the distribution of CO2 in the sandstone sample is more heterogeneous and larger fluid patches are developed in it during CO2 drainage. In contrast, the tuff sample shows the development of very small and dispersed CO2 patches and relatively well mixing state of CO2 and brine in the rock. We then use the random patchy saturation model to interpret the results theoretically. The results indicate that the characteristic patch size is in an order of tens of millimeters in the experiment using sandstone sample, whereas it is smaller than 0.1 mm in the experiment using tuff sample. Whether the scale of the strong-contrast heterogeneity created by patchy CO2 saturation is significant to wave velocity is determined by the ratio of patch size and fluid diffusion length (A/L ratio), which is a function of wave frequency and hydraulic diffusion coefficient of the rock. If the scale of the heterogeneity is larger than the fluid diffusion length at a wave frequency, the strain field created by wave propagation cannot be relaxed during a half period and the media shows the stiffening effect-a higher velocity at macroscale. These suggest that one should pay attenuation to the effect of fluid distribution and degree of phase mixing when evaluating fluid saturation from P-wave velocity using seismic methods, if the reservoir develops significant large-scale heterogeneity. Furthermore, the velocity becomes insensitive to saturation changes when CO2 saturation becomes higher than approximately 0.2, if its changes follow the Gassmann-Wood relationship (with small A/L ratio at lower frequencies). In contrast, the velocity remains changing with CO2 saturation at higher CO2 saturation if the changes follow the Gassmann-Hill relationship (with large A/L ratio at higher frequencies). The changes suggest the selection of wave frequency is critical to validly monitor the saturation changes at higher CO2 saturations. © 2017 The Authors.","CO2 storage; fluid diffusion length; P-wave velocity; patchy saturation; X-ray CT imaging","Acoustic wave velocity; Computerized tomography; Diffusion; Diffusion in liquids; Greenhouse gases; Mixing; Rocks; Sandstone; Seismic waves; Seismology; Ultrasonic applications; Velocity; Wave propagation; CO2 storage; Fluid diffusion; High injection pressures; Homogeneous structure; P-wave velocity; Scale heterogeneities; Ultrasonic frequency; X-ray CT; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029661249

In this work, we applied an advanced online-coupled meteorology and chemistry model, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF/Chem), to the continental U.S. for current (2001-2010) and future (2046-2055) decades under four climate scenarios including the Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 and 8.5 and the Technology Driver Model (TDM) A1B and B2. Our goal is to quantify the impact of projected changes in anthropogenic and biogenic emissions and climate on future air quality under various climate scenarios for policy analysis for emission control and mitigation of adverse climate change. The simulations are performed at 36-, 12-km, and 4-km over North America, Continental U.S., and selected states, respectively. A comprehensive evaluation has been performed for the current simulation period using available observations from surface networks and satellites and shows an overall good performance in reproducing climatic and chemical observations at all grid scales. Future air quality features greater reduction in PM2.5 by RCP 4.5/8.5 than TDM B2/A1B and decreased O3 over most areas in the U.S. by RCP4.5 and TDM B2, indicating the benefits of carbon policy and technology changes with greater emission reductions.

In this study, we collected surface snow and snowpit samples from four glaciers in the southeastern TP in June 2015 to investigate the comprehensive observational data set of LAIs. Results showed that the LAI concentrations were much higher in the aged snow and granular ice than in the fresh snow and snowpits due to postdepositional processes. Impurity concentrations fluctuated across snowpits, with maximum LAI concentrations frequently occurring toward the bottom of snowpits. Based on the SNow ICe Aerosol Radiative model, the albedo simulation indicated that black carbon and dust account for approximately 20% of the albedo reduction relative to clean snow. The radiative forcing caused by black carbon and dust deposition on the glaciers were between 1.0-141 W m-2 and 1.5-120 W m-2, respectively. Black carbon (BC) played a larger role in albedo reduction and radiative forcing than dust in the study area, enhancing approximately 15% of glacier melt. Analysis based on the Fire INventory from NCAR indicated that nonbiomass-burning sources of BC played an important role in the total BC deposition, especially during the monsoon season. This study suggests that eliminating anthropogenic BC could mitigate glacier melt in the future of the southeastern TP. Plain Language Summary In this study, we focused on light-absorbing impurities (LAIs), including black carbon, organic carbon, and mineral dust in glacial surface snow from southeaster Tibetan glaciers. This study showed the concentrations of LAIs, and estimated their impact on albedo reduction. Furthermore, we discussed the potential source of impurities and their impact to the study area. These results provide scientific basis for regional mitigation efforts to reduce black carbon. © 2017. American Geophysical Union.

Although there are some efforts on studying the capillary pressure effect on phase behavior, it has not been clearly understood until recently in the field application considering multiple components in tight oil reservoirs. In this study, we present a methodology to investigate the phase behavior of carbon dioxide (CO2)/hydrocarbon systems with and without the capillary pressure effect. We modify the Peng-Robinson equation of state considering inequalities of hydrocarbon liquid and vapor pressures. Rachford-Rice flash calculation, criterion of Gibbs free energy minimization, and Newton-Raphson method are utilized together to calculate the phase equilibrium between vapor and liquid. In addition, the Young-Laplace equation is applied to evaluate the capillary pressure in the presence of pore size distribution. We validate the methodology against one experimental measurement with the capillary pressure effect. Subsequently, we perform two case studies including a two-component system and a typical fluid from Bakken tight oil reservoirs. The results indicate that the reduction in the nano-pore size causes noticeable difference in the two-phase envelope. Furthermore, for the real fluid, the capillary pressure effect cannot be neglected when the pore size is less than 50 nm. Additionally, the bubble-point pressure of Bakken oil reduces nearby 500 psi when the nano-pore size reduces to 10 nm. The MMP of CO2injection is also evaluated, which experiences a decreasing trend. The developed methodology provides a better understanding of the phase behavior of CO2/hydrocarbons system, especially in the case of CO2injection into tight oil reservoirs. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Capillary pressure; CO2/hydrocarbons system; Phase behavior; Tight oil","Bottom hole pressure; Capillarity; Capillary tubes; Carbon dioxide; Equations of state of liquids; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Nanopores; Newton-Raphson method; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Phase behavior; Phase equilibria; Pore size; Transport properties; Bubble point pressure; CO2/hydrocarbons system; Gibbs free energy minimization; Peng-Robinson equation of state; Tight oil; Two component systems; Unconventional reservoirs; Young Laplace equation; Pressure effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014226780

However, few studies have been conducted on the spatial distribution of switchgrass-based bioethanol production potential in China. This study created a land surface process model (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate GIS (Geographic Information System)-based (GEPIC) model) coupled with a life cycle analysis (LCA) to explore the spatial distribution of potential bioethanol production and present a comprehensive analysis of energy efficiency and environmental impacts throughout its whole life cycle. It provides a new approach to study the bioethanol productivity and potential environmental impact from marginal lands based on the high spatial resolution GIS data, and this applies not only to China, but also to other regions and to other types of energy plant. The results indicate that approximately 59 million ha of marginal land in China are suitable for planting switchgrass, and 22 million tons of ethanol can be produced from this land. Additionally, a potential net energy gain (NEG) of 1.75 × 106 million MJ will be achieved if all of the marginal land can be used in China, and Yunnan Province offers the most significant one that accounts for 35% of the total. Finally, this study obtained that the total environmental effect index of switchgrass-based bioethanol is the equivalent of a population of approximately 20,300, and a reduction in the global warming potential (GWP) is the most significant environmental impact. © 2017 by the authors.","Bioethanol; Environmental policy integrated climate GIS (GEPIC); Life cycle analysis (LCA); Marginal land; Switchgrass","Bioethanol; Climate models; Energy efficiency; Environmental protection; Ethanol; Geographic information systems; Global warming; Life cycle; Plants (botany); Productivity; Spatial distribution; Bioethanol productivities; Environmental policy; GIS (geographic information system); Global warming potential; High spatial resolution; Life cycle analysis; Marginal lands; Switchgrass; Environmental impact",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035010183

Because of the CO2-EOR or CO2 injection, the CO2-brine-rock interactions in reservoirs will lead to a series of complex changes in the mineral composition of rocks, porosity, pore structure, properties of formation water and residual oil saturation. At the same time, the difference of the CO2 spread range in reservoirs will cause the different CO2 saturation in different regions; in the same region, the reservoir CO2 saturation will also be different at the different time. To predict the complex variation of CO2 saturation in reservoirs, the processing and interpretation of the time-lapse logging data and the comparative analysis are needed. The steps for determining the CO2 saturation are as follows. Before CO2 injection, the background values of the formation water, rock mineral composition, porosity, pore structure and oil saturation are determined by the implementation of well logging. Firstly, the formation water parameters were monitored and determined at a specified time in the process of CO2 injection or CO2-EOR. Secondly, the time-lapse well logging was carried out to determine the rock mineral composition, porosity, pore structure, oil saturation and saturation CO2. The case-hole formation resistivity, pulsed neutron logging series and C/O logging series are often used to process and interpret the results of well logging data and to predict the residual oil and CO2 saturation. In addition, if the variety of porosity would be ignored, CO2 saturation is based on the prediction. CO2 saturation is equal to the parameter such as: ((the background value of the acoustic logging porosity) - (the time-lapse neutron logging porosity))/ (the background value of the acoustic logging porosity). © 2017 The Authors.","CO2 saturation; CO2-brine-rock interaction; CO2-EOR; formation water salinity; pore; time-lapse logging","Acoustic logging; Digital storage; Enhanced recovery; Forecasting; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Injection (oil wells); Minerals; Neutron logging; Oil well flooding; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Pore structure; Porosity; Rocks; Water injection; Water well logging; Well logging; CO2-EOR; Comparative analysis; Formation-water salinity; pore; Pulsed neutron logging; Residual oil saturation; Rock interaction; Structure , properties; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029665597

It is urgent to take effective measures to reduce CO2 emissions from its intensive emission source. Chemical absorption is an effective way to cover the large reduction of CO2, and piperazine (PZ) is one of the amines that have good performance on CO2 capture. To make a deep understanding of the chemical mechanism of PZ absorbing CO2, computational studies on PZ chemically absorbing CO2 are discussed in this work using Density functional theory (DFT). Possible reaction pathways of PZ absorbing CO2 are analyzed. Due to the special chemical structure of PZ, the reaction processes can be divided into two parts, the process of (PZ+CO2)+PZ and (PZ+2CO2)+PZ. To make a good understanding of the reaction process, a comparison of that between PZ and MEA are discussed. The results show that PZ has lower forward and backward energy barriers than MEA in the zwitterion formation, but in the intermolecular hydrogen transfer process, PZ has higher forward and backward barriers than MEA.

In this work, shale samples from the Longmaxi formation in the Sichuan basin were used to investigate the mechanical properties and the acoustic emission (AE) behaviour of shale upon saturation with different fluids (water, brine, and CO2-brine mixture with different CO2 phase states) at 45 °C. X-ray fluorescence (XRF) analysis results show that major element alterations occur after shale is treated with supercritical CO2-brine and subcritical CO2-brine, the element content of Ca, K and Al in supercritical CO2-brine saturated shale was decreased by 16.7%, 5.8% and 6.3%, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) analysis results indicate that significant surface structural changes occur in shale after saturated with CO2 and brine. Furthermore, the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) and elastic modulus (E) of shale with different fluid saturation were decreased. Supercritical CO2 cause a greater reduction of UCS and E compared to subcritical CO2 due to its higher adsorption capability and larger CO2 adsorption induced swelling. The maximum reduction in UCS and E of shale was observed in the case of CO2-brine saturated samples, and the influence of the CO2 phase on the mechanical behaviour of shale under brine conditions is not negligible. The fracture propagation pattern changes in shale after fluid saturation are also explained by the AE analysis. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Acoustic emission testing; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Compressive strength; Field emission microscopes; Scanning electron microscopy; Adsorption capability; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Fracture propagation; Geological sequestration; Mechanical behaviour; Significant surfaces; Uniaxial compressive strength; X ray fluorescence analysis; Shale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029108207

The contribution of biogenic VOC (BVOC) emissions to regional ozone formation needs better quantification so that air quality regulators can effectively design emission control strategies. One of the key uncertainties for modeling BVOC emissions comes from the estimation of photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) reaching canopy. Satellite insolation retrieval data provide an alternative to prognostic meteorological models for representing the spatial and temporal variations of PAR. In this study, biogenic emission estimates generated with the MEGAN and BEIS biogenic emissions models using satellite or prognostic PAR are used to examine the contribution of BVOC to ozone in the United States. The Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (CAMx) is applied with Ozone Source Apportionment Technology (OSAT) and brute force zero-out sensitivity runs to quantify the biogenic contributions to ozone formation during May through September 2011. The satellite PAR retrievals are on average lower than modeled PAR and exhibit better agreement with SCAN and SURFRAD network measurements. Using satellite retrievals instead of modeled PAR reduces BEIS and MEGAN estimates of isoprene by an average of 3%–4% and 9%–12%, respectively. The simulations still overestimate observed ground-level isoprene concentrations by a factor of 1.1 for BEIS and 2.6 for MEGAN. The spatial pattern of biogenic ozone contribution diagnosed from OSAT differs from the brute force zero-out sensitivity results, with the former more smoothly distributed and the latter exhibiting peak impacts near metropolitan regions with intense anthropogenic NOx emissions. OSAT tends to apportion less ozone to biogenics as BVOC emissions increase, since that shifts marginal ozone formation toward more NOx-limited conditions. By contrast, zero-out source apportionment of ozone to biogenics increases with BVOC emissions. OSAT simulations with BEIS show that BVOCs typically contribute 10–19% to regional ozone concentrations at nonattainment receptor sites during episode days. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biogenic emissions; CAMx; Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES); Ozone; Ozone Source Apportionment Technology (OSAT); Photosynthetically active radiation (PAR)","Air quality; Emission control; Environmental technology; Geostationary satellites; Isoprene; Nitrogen oxides; Uncertainty analysis; Volatile organic compounds; Biogenic emission; CAMx; Geostationary operational environmental satellites; Photosynthetically active radiation; Source apportionment; Ozone; formaldehyde; isoprene; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biogenic emission; concentration (composition); emission control; formation mechanism; GOES; isoprene; nitrogen oxides; ozone; photosynthetically active radiation; research program; satellite data; source apportionment; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; ambient air; Article; canopy; meteorology; moisture; photosynthetically active radiation; priority journal; sea surface temperature; simulation; temperature; United States; velocity; wind; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020051001

The sewage in the drainage system can be the low grade thermal source for building heating and cooling. Sewage source heat pump technology can efficiently extract or discharge the amount of heat from the sewage in the drainage system for building heating or cooling. The field test of the actual operation thermal performance of the sewage source heat pump were carried out and investigated. The sewage source heat pump system were continuously measured for 72 hours. Based on the test datum, the average COP of the heat pump was 4.5. The relationship between energy consumption of system and energy consumption of transportation are analyzed. The analysis shows that the pump of this system cannot match the load change well and the use of variable frequency pump can improve the energy efficiency of the system. Before the use of the sewage source heat pump system, the traditional coal-fired boiler and air-cooled chiller are the heating and cooling system of this building. Compared with the traditional coal-fired boiler and air-cooled chiller, the advantages of sewage source heat pump system in energy saving, economy and environmental protection are analyzed. The results show that: Compared with the original system, direct heat exchange type sewage source heat pump system can save 53% of the primary energy consumption, reduce the annual operating cost by 11%, increase the initial investment by a factor of 14.3%, and the payback period of incremental investment is about 4.7 years.

When equipped with cooled exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and three way catalyst (TWC), natural gas engines operating at stoichiometric conditions are capable of achieving extremely low transient emissions. In this paper, the transient emission characteristics of a heavy-duty natural gas engine at stoichiometric operation with EGR and TWC are experimentally studied based on the world harmonized transient cycle (WHTC). The results show that both the raw carbon monoxide (CO) and total hydrocarbon (THC) emissions are higher in the hot start test while the raw NOx emissions are higher in the cold start test. When measurements are conducted after the TWC, all these emissions are higher in the cold start test. Among all the sub-cycles of WHTC, the urban sub-cycle plays the most important role for all three emissions in both cold start and hot start conditions except the after three way catalyst (ATWC) CO emissions in the cold start test, where the motorway sub-cycle takes up the highest percentage. In summary, CO, nitrogen oxide (NOx) as well as non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) emissions can meet the requirements of Euro VI emission standards, whereas CH4 emissions are higher than the corresponding standard, suggesting that improvements in the performance of the catalyst are essential. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","EGR; Emissions; Natural gas engines; Stoichiometric; TWC","Carbon; Carbon monoxide; Catalysts; Engines; Exhaust gas recirculation; Exhaust gases; Gas engines; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Natural gas; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Emission regulation; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Non-methane hydrocarbons; Stoichiometric; Stringent standards; Three way catalysts; Transient emission characteristics; Transient emissions; Gas emissions; carbon monoxide; catalyst; cooling; emission; motorway; natural gas; nitrogen oxides; operations technology; performance assessment; stoichiometry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019868417

The radicals involved in the reaction as intermediates were observed by ESR to identify the reduction pathways. Furthermore, the hypothetical pathways were verified by the steady-state approximation model. The calculated rate constants of the final products and intermediates (including radicals) indicated that the formation of CH3OH was mainly derived from CO-rather than from HCOOH.

While in Ir(iii)-Ru(ii) complexes, an additional decay channel is opened for the energy transfer from the higher energy level MLCT state of Ir(iii)-coordinated units to the lower-energy level MLCT state of Ru(ii)-coordinated units, as approved by both experimental and theoretical DFT calculations. Therefore, similar deep red emission profiles originating from Ru(ii) units are observed in Ir(iii)-Ru(ii) systems. These binuclear complexes were further tested as photosensitizers (PSs) to produce H2 in photocatalytic water reduction systems. The highest H2 production efficiency can be obtained in the heteronuclear IrRu(1) system after 80 hours continuous production with a TON value of 1088 based on the amount of IrRu(1) as PS, much higher than the other binunclear complexes and mononuclear counterparts. The results provide a new insight into the designing guidelines for noble metal complexes as emitting centers and photosensitizers in lighting/display materials and devices, as well as photocatalytic water splitting systems. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Binary alloys; Bins; Coordination reactions; Energy transfer; Hydrogen production; Iridium; Ligands; Metal complexes; Photosensitizers; Rubidium compounds; Ruthenium; Ruthenium alloys; Synthesis (chemical); Absorption and photoluminescence; Binuclear complexes; Continuous production; DFT calculation; Metal to ligand charge transfers; Organic ligands; Photocatalytic water splitting; Stepwise methods; Iridium alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018364508

Due to lack of surface monitoring stations, this study analyzes long term trend of NO2and SO2levels (2005–2014), retrieved from Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) board on the NASA's Aura satellite, in an important region of China – Henan Province. Henan Province, located in North China Plain, has encountered serious air pollution problems including extremely high PM2.5concentrations and as one of the most polluted region in China. The satellite spatial images clearly show that high levels of both NO2and SO2are concentrated in north and northeastern regions with much lower levels observed in other parts of Henan. Both pollutants exhibit the highest levels in winter with the least in summer/spring. The temporal trend analysis based on moving average of deseasonalized and decyclic data indicates that for NO2, there is a continuous increasing pattern from 2005 to 2011 at 6.4% per year, thereafter, it shows a decreasing trend (10.6% per year). As for SO2, the increasing trend is about 16% per year from 2005 to 2007 with decreasing rate 7% per year from 2007 to 2014. The economic development with incredible annual 11% GDP growth in Henan is responsible for increasing levels of NO2and SO2. The observed decreasing SO2level starting in 2007 is due to reduced SO2emission, utilization of flue gas desulfurization (FGD) devices and to some extent, in preparation of Beijing 2008 Olympic Games. On the other hand, increasing vehicle numbers (155% from 2006 to 2012) and coal consumption (37% during the same span), along with the lack of denitration process for removing flue/exhaust gas NOxare responsible for increasing NO2trend until 2011. The ratio of SO2/NO2started decreasing in 2007 and dropped significantly from 2011 to 2013 indicating good performance of FGD and ever increasing NOxcontribution from mobile sources. Unlike those observed in developed countries (US, EU and Japan) where a decreasing trend for both SO2and NO2has been observed since 1990s, the observed upward and downward trend found in Henan is similar to those found in North China Plain and other parts of China. The spatial and temporal trend analyses of SO2and NO2in four other regions in Henan further indicate a similar trend to those observed in Henan Province, albeit with different increasing and decreasing rate. The results provide regulatory agency to develop action plans to combat air pollution problem in general and SO2and NO2problems in particular in Henan. The implications of our findings and recommendations for decision makers are discussed in the paper. © 2016","Henan province; Long term trend analysis; OMI; SO2and NO2","Air quality; Atmospheric chemistry; Climate change; Decision making; NASA; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Developed countries; Economic development; Flue gas desulfurization(FGD); Henan Province; Long-term trend; Ozone monitoring instruments; SO2and NO2; Spatial and temporal trends; Ultraviolet spectrometers; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; Aura (satellite); concentration (composition); European Union; long-term change; nitrous oxide; particle size; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution control; pollution monitoring; satellite imagery; spatiotemporal analysis; sulfur dioxide; trend analysis; troposphere; air monitoring; air pollution; Article; China; desulfurization; developed country; economic development; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; ozone monitoring instrument; priority journal; procedures, parameters and devices; spatiotemporal analysis; spring; summer; trend study; winter; Beijing [China]; China; Henan; Japan; North China Plain; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011304307

This study uses panel data on 29 Chinese provinces from 1995 to 2012 to investigate the impact of fiscal decentralization on the functional mechanisms of environmental policy while controlling for the spatial correlations of carbon emission. The empirical results indicate that environmental policy alone can achieve the objective of reducing carbon emissions. However, the Chinese style fiscal decentralization makes the environmental policy significantly promote carbon emissions, leading to a green paradox. Moreover, we find that the impact of fiscal decentralization on environmental policy varies greatly among different geographical regions and the direct-controlled municipalities. In addition, our study confirms the spatial correlations in China's carbon emissions by using a spatial integration term. Finally, we recommend that emission reduction efforts should be incorporated into the local government's performance evaluation system to improve the institutional environment. Further, differentiated environmental policies and measures should be considered for different provinces to maximize the emission reduction potential. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Environmental regulation; Fiscal decentralization; Green paradox","Carbon; Emission control; Environmental regulations; Geographical regions; Carbon emissions; Emission reduction potentials; Environmental policy; Fiscal decentralization; Functional mechanisms; Green paradoxes; Performance evaluation system; Spatial integrations; Environmental protection; carbon emission; decentralization; emission control; empirical analysis; environmental policy; panel data; policy implementation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009959537

Through stimulating activities of in situ microbial communities, higher methane production rate can be achieved compared to those without biostimulation. However, it is commonly observed that upon stimulation either in situ or ex situ, methane production will increase but halt after certain period of time. This study was thus designed to identify reasons for this behavior and provide insight on how to sustain coal biogasification over longer durations. It was found out that after methane production rate stopped increasing, coal, at the studied loading, was still bioavailable. The headspace gas and the coal degradation intermediates were not toxic or inhibitory to the bioconversion process. Instead, lack of nutrients, especially those provided through yeast extract and peptone was critical for sustained methane release from coal. Although these two nutrients could be used as carbon sources, negligible amount of methane was observed from control reactors without coal. At least, these were true for the microbial community and the bituminous coal investigated here. Thus, to convert coal to methane continuously at a high rate that is possible, site-specific nutrient solution needs to be supplemented periodically. © 2017","Biogasification; Bituminous coal; Microbial community; Nutrient solution; Sustained methane release","Bituminous coal; Carbon; Methane; Microorganisms; Nutrients; Bioconversion process; Biogasification; Degradation intermediates; Evaluating approach; Methane production; Methane release; Microbial communities; Nutrient solution; Coal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018515648

Twelve particle types were identified and classified as dust particles (Dust), four types of carbonaceous particles, organic nitrogen and potassium containing particles (KCN), four types of secondary particles, Na-K-containing particles (NaK), and metal-containing particles (Metal). The highest contribution of particles was from potassium with elemental carbon (KEC; 23.0%), and the lowest from elemental carbon (EC; 0.2%). All types of particles showed different diurnal variations and size distributions, which were closely related to their sources and reactions in the atmosphere. The eastern and southern air masses corresponded with high PM2.5 mass concentrations. The contributions of KEC and K-sulfate (KSO4) particles to PM2.5 were clearly higher than those in air masses from the southeast. During polluted days, the contributions of KEC and KSO4 particles increased, while the contributions of organic carbon (OC), combined OC and EC particles (OCEC), and K-nitrate (KNO3) particles decreased. This shows the importance of biomass burning and industrial emissions for the PM2.5 pollution in Chengdu. These results will be useful for the in-depth understanding of the PM2.5 pollution in Chengdu, even in Sichuan basin. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical composition; Chengdu; Single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS); Single particles","Aerosols; Air pollution; Dust; Industrial emissions; Mass spectrometers; Mass spectrometry; Organic carbon; Potash; Potassium; Potassium Nitrate; Sulfur compounds; Aerosol mass spectrometers; Chemical compositions; Chengdu; In-depth understanding; Meteorological condition; Monitoring instruments; Single particle; Single particle mass spectrometry; Particles (particulate matter); carbon; element; metal; organic carbon; organic nitrogen; potassium; sodium; aerosol composition; air mass; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; chemical composition; concentration (composition); environmental conditions; industrial emission; mass spectrometry; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; summer; aerosol; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Article; atmosphere; biomass; chemical analysis; China; circadian rhythm; combustion; concentration (parameters); dilution; dust; mass spectrometer; mass spectrometry; measurement; meteorology; particle size; particulate matter; pollutant; priority journal; summer; Chengdu; China; Sichuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015363960

However, fluorescence imaging is limited by depth of penetration and high scattering losses, which leads to low sensitivity in vivo systems for external detection. In contrast, photoacoustic (PA) imaging, an emerging modality, is capable of deep tissue, noninvasive imaging by combining near infrared light excitation and ultrasound detection. In this work, we develop the theoretical concept whereby the voltage-dependent quenching of dye fluorescence leads to a reciprocal enhancement of PA intensity. Based on this concept, we synthesized a novel near infrared photoacoustic VSD (PA-VSD) whose PA intensity change is sensitive to membrane potential. In the polarized state, this cyanine-based probe enhances PA intensity while decreasing fluorescence output in a lipid vesicle membrane model. With a 3-9 μM VSD concentration, we measured a PA signal increase in the range of 5.3 % to 18.1 %, and observed a corresponding signal reduction in fluorescence emission of 30.0 % to 48.7 %. A theoretical model successfully accounts for how the experimental PA intensity change depends on fluorescence and absorbance properties of the dye. These results not only demonstrate the voltage sensing capability of the dye, but also indicate the necessity of considering both fluorescence and absorbance spectral sensitivities in order to optimize the characteristics of improved photoacoustic probes. Together, our results demonstrate photoacoustic sensing as a potential new modality for sub-second recording and external imaging of electrophysiological and neurochemical events in the brain. © 2017 SPIE.","Fluorescence; Membrane potential; Photoacoustics; Voltage sensitive dye","Electrophysiology; Infrared devices; Membranes; Photoacoustic effect; Photons; Probes; Spectroscopy; Ultrasonic applications; Absorbance properties; Fluorescence emission; Fluorescence intensities; Membrane potentials; Neuronal electrical activities; Spectral sensitivity; Ultrasound detection; Voltage sensitive dyes; Fluorescence",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019215110

Most power plants will adopt the best available technology under an emissions trading program. In addition, national emissions trading encourages power plants to adopt technologies with relatively higher removal rates compared with separate regional emissions trading systems, but a national program decreases the adoption of most advanced technology.

It is, therefore, important to develop cost-effective methods to reduce these emissions. Air cleaning technologies, including chemical and biological filters, have been proposed to clean the exhaust ventilation air from confined livestock buildings. However, it requires large capacity of the air cleaning unit for the total exhaust air and, consequently, results in high investment and operational costs of the livestock production system. Aiming at emission reduction and optimal indoor air quality of confined farm animal buildings, a concept of partial pit ventilation has been investigated in varied conditions in Denmark. Partial pit ventilation is based on the hypothesis that the most polluted air can be removed by a separate air exhaust near the pollution sources in pit head space, while the room air exhaust is kept as a major ventilation exhaust and controlled according to indoor thermal conditions. The airflow rate of the partial pit air exhaust is designed and controlled as only a small portion of the designed ventilation capacity of the building. By cleaning the pit exhaust air only, the required capacity for a cleaning unit will be significantly reduced. The investigations in Denmark, mostly in growing-finishing pig housing, have shown that partial pit air exhaust can remove a large share of the ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and odor from the room using a pit air exhaust rate of 10% of the designed ventilation capacity, which is equivalent to 10 m3 h-1 pig-1 for growing-finishing pig housing. This article provides an overview of the investigation results currently available on a partial pit air exhaust (PPAE) system, including both numerical simulations and experimental investigations, to identify important factors that may affect the system performances for removal of ammonia and other pollutants from the animal housing and to address the extension work that may be needed to apply the method in actual production scales. It is shown that PPAE is an effective approach to reduce emissions by combining an effective exhaust cleaner. The system can significantly improve the indoor air quality, because a considerable amount of the concentrated pollutants in the air are removed directly via PPAE. The pollutant removal via PPAE is influenced by airflow patterns, airflow rates, and locations of PPAE openings in pit headspace. Therefore, configuration and control of ventilation systems are crucial for system efficiency. Besides, slatted floor openings, as well as animal lying behavior and location, can also influence the pollutant removal ratio by a PPAE. To achieve an optimal design and control of the system, further systematic investigations, both experimental and numerical, are still needed. © 2017 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Ammonia emission reduction; Hydrogen sulfide; Indoor air quality; Odor; Partial pit ventilation","Agriculture; Air quality; Ammonia; Animals; Chemical cleaning; Cleaning; Cost effectiveness; Desulfurization; Economics; Emission control; Housing; Hydrogen sulfide; Indoor air pollution; Mammals; Numerical methods; Odor control; Odors; Pollution; Storm sewers; Sulfur determination; Thermal pollution; Ventilation; Ventilation exhausts; Ammonia emissions; Atmospheric environment; Chemical and biologicals; Configuration and control; Experimental investigations; Indoor air quality; Indoor thermal conditions; Pit ventilations; Air cleaners",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018693114

The classification enabled identifying trace gas mixing ratios associated with background air and long-range transport of continental emissions, which were defined as chemical signatures. Comparison between the chemical signatures revealed the impacts of natural and anthropogenic sources, as well as chemical and physical processes during long transport, on air composition in the remote North Atlantic. Transport of North American anthropogenic emissions (NA-Anthro) and summertime wildfire plumes (Fire) significantly enhanced CO and O3 at PMO. Summertime CO enhancements caused by NA-Anthro were found to have been decreasing by a rate of 0.67 ± 0.60 ppbv/year in the ten-year period, due possibly to reduction of emissions in North America. Downward mixing from the upper troposphere and stratosphere due to the persistent Azores-Bermuda anticyclone causes enhanced O3 and nitrogen oxides. The d [O3]/d [CO] value was used to investigate O3 sources and chemistry in different transport patterns. The transport pattern affected by Fire had the lowest d [O3]/d [CO], which was likely due to intense CO production and depressed O3 production in wildfire plumes. Slightly enhanced O3 and d [O3]/d [CO] were found in the background air, suggesting that weak downward mixing from the upper troposphere is common at PMO. Enhancements of both butane isomers were found during upslope flow periods, indicating contributions from local sources. The consistent ratio of butane isomers associated with the background air and NA-anthro implies no clear difference in the oxidation rates of the butane isomers during long transport. Based on observed relationships between non-methane hydrocarbons, the averaged photochemical age of the air masses at PMO was estimated to be 11 ± 4 days.

Largest decreases were observed for secondary sulfate and nitrate species (58% and 44%, respectively). The amount of neutralization by ammonium did not change substantially over the time period in spite of substantial decreases in sulfate and nitrate concentrations. Total mobile source impacts decreased more at urban sites (39%) than rural sites (23%), whereas biomass burning decreased more at rural sites (34%) than urban sites (27%). The estimated central-site source impacts are found to spatially represent large areas for secondary pollutants, smaller areas for biomass burning and dust, and very local areas for mobile sources and coal combustion. Trends from the National Emissions Inventory were compared with the annual trends of mobile source impacts, coal combustion impacts, and sulfate concentrations, resulting in statistically significant positive trends with Pearson R2 of 0.80, 0.64, and 0.79, respectively. Results presented here suggest that PM2.5 reductions in Georgia and the Southeast have been achieved by control of both stationary and mobile sources, and that PM2.5 is comprised of increasing fractions of biomass burning emissions and suspended dust. The temporal trends of source impacts at each site adds information about source changes beyond the every-three-year emission inventories for evaluation of emission-based model results. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; CMB; Health impacts; National Emissions Inventory; PM2.5; Source apportionment","Air quality; Biomass; Coal; Coal dust; Mobile power plants; Nitrates; Organic carbon; Particulate emissions; Rural areas; Sulfur compounds; Urban growth; Biomass burning emissions; Chemical mass balance receptor models; Health impact; Heavy duty diesel vehicles; Light duty gasoline vehicles; National emissions inventories; PM2.5; Source apportionment; Coal combustion; gasoline; air quality; ambient air; biomass burning; chemical mass balance; concentration (composition); emission inventory; health impact; neutralization; particulate matter; pollution effect; pollution monitoring; source apportionment; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollution control; air quality; Article; biomass; combustion; electric power plant; limit of detection; particulate matter; priority journal; spatiotemporal analysis; uncertainty; Georgia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018326290

The MEC was aimed at exploiting residual COD of TP-AD effluents at the MEC anode in order to support CO2 removal and methane generation at the MEC cathode (fed by a CO2-rich gas phase, simulating a biogas). Feeding by 2nd phase digestate caused a loss of MEC performance, due to poor biodegradability of digestate COD under chosen anodic operating conditions (+0.2 V vs SHE, HRT 13 h, organic load 2.3 g COD/L d). On the other hand, by using the 1st phase fermentate (rich in volatile fatty acids, VFA), good MEC performance was recovered with a current of 60 ± 4 mA and a methane production rate of 33 ± 3 meq/L d. However, periodic baskwashing was also necessary to recover fouling effects. Moreover, partial nitrogen removal (228 mg N/L d) from the fermentate was obtained because ammonium was transported across the separation membrane and then recovered through the cathodic concentrated spill (at 3177 ± 97 mg N/L). Cation transport also generated net alkalinity which strongly contributed to CO2 removal (besides methane generation). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Ammonium removal; Anaerobic digestion effluents; Methane production; Microbial electrolysis cell; Two phase anaerobic digestion; Volatile fatty acids","Biodegradability; Carbon dioxide; Effluents; Electrodes; Electrolysis; Electrolytic cells; Fatty acids; Methanation; Methane; Microbial fuel cells; Municipal solid waste; Nitrogen removal; Recovery; Regenerative fuel cells; Volatile fatty acids; Ammonium removal; Cation transports; Fouling effects; Methane production; Operating condition; Organic fraction of municipal solid wastes; Separation membranes; Two phase anaerobic digestion; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030564206

To comprehensively assess urban WWTP performance, a distance function approach was configured to quantify the efficiency with capital cost and energy consumption as inputs, removals of four types of pollutants as desirable outputs, and emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) as undesirable output. Adding both direct and indirect GHG emissions into the efficiency metrics would help decision makers obtain a more profound understanding of urban WWTPs’ contribution to both aquatic and atmospheric environments. The method was applied to 1079 urban WWTPs across China adopting eight major biological technologies. The average efficiency score was 0.322, implying that GHG emissions could decrease by 32.2% if all plants worked efficiently. Eight plants were deemed the most efficient and formed a frontier of the best practices, while 12 plants were the most inefficient with distances from the frontier larger than 0.650. The parameterized distance function could be used to set a benchmark system for the performance surveillance of urban WWTPs. The integrated efficiency assessment considering multiple dimensions and statistical analysis on a large sample allowed us to reveal reasons for efficiency gaps. Statistic test results showed that plants scale, technology, and capacity of tertiary treatment were significant for explaining efficiency disparities. Large-scale plants, plants with the bioreactors or the anaerobic-anoxic-oxic processes, and plants without tertiary treatment processes tended to be more efficient, showing the advantage in co-benefiting water pollutants and GHG control. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","Benchmarking; Distance function; Efficiency assessment; Greenhouse gas emission; Wastewater treatment plant","Benchmarking; Biological water treatment; Decision making; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Sewage pumping plants; Toxicity; Wastewater reclamation; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution; Water recycling; Water treatment plants; Anaerobic-anoxic-oxic process; Atmospheric environment; Distance functions; Efficiency assessment; Negative externalities; Urban wastewater treatment plants; Urban water environments; Wastewater treatment plants; Greenhouse gases; benchmarking; emission; greenhouse gas; technology adoption; urban area; wastewater; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; aquatic environment; Article; atmosphere; benchmarking; bioreactor; biotechnology; carbon footprint; China; cost effectiveness analysis; energy consumption; productivity; quantitative analysis; urban area; waste water treatment plant; water pollution control; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009852007

Three-dimensional models were prepared via Gambit software and studied in Fluent software. The wind speed entering the computing field was equal to 26.4m/s and the Dutch wind nuisance standard NEN 8100 was applied as the comfort criterion. The results showed a relationship between the extent of the central courtyard and the impact of severe storms on it, since an increase in the area of the courtyard provides enough space for the wind flow and move around it. This feature reaches its climax if the length to height proportion increases, as the wind brings the shifting sands into large courtyards, therefore, the architects tried to provide better conditions by creating microclimates. © 2017, Institut za Arhitekturu i Urbanizam Srbije.","CFD simulation; Historical houses; Residential architecture; Storm; Yazd area",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046288798

However, the lack of distribution data makes predictions at species level a difficult task, mainly in regions of higher biodiversity. To overcome this problem, we use native landcover as a surrogate biodiversity, because it can represent specialized habitat for species, and investigate the effects of future climate change on Brazilian biomes. We characterize the climatic niches of native landcover and use ecological niche modeling to predict the potential distribution under current and future climate scenarios. Our results highlight expansion of the distribution of open vegetation and the contraction of closed forests. Drier Brazilian biomes, like Caatinga and Cerrado, are predicted to expand their distributions, being the most resistant to climate change impacts. However, these would also be affected by losses of their closed forest enclaves and their habitat-specific or endemic species. Replacement by open vegetation and overall reductions are a considerable risk for closed forest, threatening Amazon and Atlantic forest biomes. Here, we evidence the impacts of climate change on Brazilian biomes, and draw attention to the necessity for management and attenuation plans to guarantee the future of Brazilian biodiversity. © 2017, Academia Brasileira de Ciencias.

In a global change scenario, high mountains represent an exceptional ecology field lab for long-term research and monitoring, offering an enormous mosaic of ecological conditions existing along mountain slopes. Mountains ecosystems also constitute invaluable observatories of the atmosphere and all the aspects related to climate, atmospheric particle deposition, pollutants, greenhouse gases, or the transport of resistant biological forms. Mountains are sensors for early detection of change. In the Sierra Nevada LTER site (southern Spain), we have been implementing a long-term monitoring programme taking advantage of the high altitude and geographical position of this Mediterranean mountain. We have identified the main expected impacts in the context of global change and analysed the biophysical and socioeconomic data available to assess exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of ecosystems to future scenarios. The study incorporates a retrospective of past human management of land use, to understand the current state of conservation of the ecosystems and make plausible forecasts on its response to future scenarios.

To address this problem, an adequate traffic control could produce many benefits, including reduced pollutant emissions and reduced travel times. If it were possible to characterize the state of traffic by predicting traffic conditions, measures could be taken to preventively mitigate the effects of congestion and related problems. This paper performs an experimental study of the traffic distribution in the city of Valencia, characterizing the different streets of the city in terms of vehicle load with respect to the travel time during rush hour traffic conditions. Experimental results based on realistic vehicular traffic traces show that most of the street segments under analysis present a good fit under quadratic regression, although a large number of street segments fall under other categories mainly due to lack of traffic. Based on this study, a clustering analysis study associated to the different streets shows how these streets can be classified into four independent categories, evidencing an uneven traffic distribution throughout the city. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Clustering; Traffic behavior; Traffic prediction; Urban traffic; Valencia","Ad hoc networks; Mobile ad hoc networks; Motor transportation; Traffic control; Travel time; Wireless ad hoc networks; Clustering; Traffic behavior; Traffic prediction; Urban traffic; Valencia; Traffic congestion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030148526

One of the crucial parts in management strategy is the prediction of behaviour of vital transportation elements. Used prediction models should accurately describe the process of degradation and allow forecasting of structural condition by considering environment, usage and maintenance actions. Deterioration models can be divided into mathematical (statistical), physical and empirical models. Statistical models are based on data that describe condition of structure, such as for example condition rating. Physical models describe damage-causing processes and empirical models are experience based. The focus of this paper is to present the physical model of carbonation in assessment of performance of existing reinforced concrete structures in transportation networks. Assessment is done through determining the probability of limit state of depassivation. In order to determine the carbonation without testing, a special attention has to be given to environmental and material parameter identification. Herein, the identification takes into account weather specifics and construction practice in Austria. Finally, the reliability of existing reinforced concrete structures for combination of different exposure classes and material characteristics is analysed. Based on the analysis of reliability, the carbonation nomogram for engineering use is presented, showing the reliability indices β for the service life of 50 years. © 2017 Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland.","Carbonation; Concrete performance; Reliability","Carbonation; Concrete buildings; Concrete construction; Corrosion; Deterioration; Forecasting; Reliability; Reliability analysis; Carbonation induced corrosions; Concrete performance; Construction practice; Existing reinforced concrete; Material characteristics; Material parameter identification; Transportation infrastructure managements; Transportation network; Reinforced concrete",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020052947

Global trade is highly dependent on shipping which covers around 90% of commercial demand. Now the industry is expected to navigate through many twists and turns of different situations like upcoming regulations, climate change, energy shortages and technological revolutions. Technological development is apparent across all marine sectors due to the rapid development of sensor technology, IT, automation and robotics. The industry must continue to develop at a rapid pace over the next decade in order to be able to adapt to upcoming regulations and market pressure. Ship intelligence will be the driving force shaping the future of the industry. Ships generate a large volume of data from different sources and in different formats. So big data has become the talk of the industry nowadays. Big data analysis discovers correlations between different measurable or unmeasurable parameters to determine hidden patterns and trends. This analysis will have a significant impact on vessel performance monitoring and provide performance prediction, real-time transparency, and decision-making support to the ship operator. Big data will also bring new opportunities and challenges for the maritime industry. It will increase the capability of performance monitoring, remove human error and increase interdependencies of components. However, the industry will have to face many challenges such as data processing, reliability, and data security. Many regulations rely on ship data including the new EU MRV (Monitoring, Reporting and Verification) regulation to quantify the CO2 emissions for ships above 5000 gross tonnage. As a result, ship operators will have to monitor and report the verified amount of CO2 emitted by their vessels on voyages to, from and between EU ports and will also be required to provide information on energy efficiency parameters. The MRV is a data-oriented regulation requiring ship operators to capture and monitor the ship emissions and other related data and although it is a regional regulation at the moment there is scope for the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) to implement it globally in the near future. © 2017 The Authors.","big data; Carbon emission; data-oriented; MRV","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Commerce; Data handling; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Marine engineering; Metadata; Public utilities; Ships; Carbon emissions; data-oriented; Decision making support; Global carbon emission; International maritime organisations; Performance prediction; Technological development; Technological revolution; Big data",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034664479

This paper is aimed at policy development in terms of energy efficiency and building design as Malaysia has yet to establish any mandatory energy efficiency or energy performance building code. The focus on public low-cost housing projects is important as it is administered by government agencies and provides possible streamlining of proposed energy policies for the housing sector. Presented in this paper are findings from fieldwork conducted to investigate the energy performance and green house gas (GHG) emissions from the building operation of two public low-cost housing projects in Kuala Lumpur. The baseline calculations use UNEP-SBCI's Common Carbon Metric tool to provide project-specific calculations of energy and emissions intensity with its bottom-up approach, while presenting a national-scale projection using its top-down approach. Findings from bottom-up analysis suggest that Malaysian public low-cost housing households consume more than benchmarks set by the World Energy Council and the International Energy Agency, in terms of Building Energy Index (BEI) of kwh/m2/year. This is a reflection of the absence of building energy efficiency legislation in Malaysia, both for residential and non-residential buildings.

Retrofit programmes aiming to improve energy efficiency of buildings have been initiated in the UK for more than two decades to achieve 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Building retrofit is a cost-effective way to reduce energy demand of existing buildings and improve thermal comfort. This research evaluates the building performance of a council tower block in London. Initial field surveys highlighted the serious damp and mould issues in several flats. This leads to health concerns caused by a combination of inefficient building envelope and partial unawareness of the occupants concerning efficient use of their homes. The research focuses on the interactions between the building performance, the occupants' energy consumption behaviour and thermal comfort in winter. In phase one of the project, building monitoring and simulation analysis were undertaken to assess the building performance and indoor thermal conditions. The second phase of the project focuses on the building performance optimisation and methods for energy efficient retrofit. This includes simulation analysis and a questionnaire-based survey to define the occupants' energy consumption behaviour and thermal comfort.

The aim of this project is to improve energy security, reduce costs and carbon dioxide emissions and increase the use of renewable energy resources. Enhancement of the current isolated power networks through interconnectors will allow higher integration of intermittent wind energy loads to the system. This paper analyses an action plan alongside its economic and carbon dioxide emissions impact, between 2017 and 2030, for the implementation of 258·6MW wind farms in the region, the equivalent of 772·5GWh/year according to the Weibull wind speed distribution analysis. The estimated average investment return rate for wind projects equals 23%. This is calculated using a life cycle cost analysis. The average cost of energy by using the International Energy Agency methodology equals €80·9/MWh. This paper concludes that the Cyclades interconnection will assist in transforming the region into a wind energy hub, with zero carbon dioxide emissions, allowing electricity exports of 101 GWh/year to the Greek mainland, while reducing the total electricity costs by €1·4 billion from 2017 to 2030.","Electrical engineering & distribution; Power; Renewable energy","Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Energy policy; Energy security; Global warming; Investments; Life cycle; Weibull distribution; Wind; Wind power; Carbon dioxide emissions; International energy agency; Investment returns; Life cycle cost analysis; National grid systems; Power; Renewable energies; Wind speed distribution; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014647149

A number of interconnections between the islands and the national grid system have been scheduled for the upcoming years. In this paper, we analyse the economic and environmental benefits following the interconnections. It was concluded that Greece could save between 2015 and 2040, from 9.73 to 17.82 billion Euros, subject to fuel price costs and demand growth. These amounts are charged to the Greek power customers through a cross subsidisation policy known as public service obligation.

For an architect today, the method to design a passive house in cold weather and the choice of the Architectural Actions (AA), are clearly established. When the question comes to how to build a passive house in warmer, hot, and very hot climates, the strategies are poor and often results of a combination of western strategies with a local relook. From several visits in Middle East countries, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Palestine, Qatar, we concluded that the strategy for low consumption houses is not established yet and poorly grasped. The lack of training on low energy consumption in hot climate and the low price of energy, force designers and owners to relay on over usage of air-conditioning systems as measures to catch up on poor bioclimatic design.

In the present study, a Ni-free cathode with competitive performance and higher durability than a well performing Ni-YSZ cermet for CO2 electrolysis using SOECs is prepared. A (La, Sr)(Cr, Mn)O3/(Gd, Ce)O2 (LSCM/GDC) cathode fabricated by vacuum infiltration of GDC nitrate solutions into a LSCM/YSZ (8 mol% yttria stabilised zirconia) skeleton is reported. A porous YSZ layer introduced between the dense electrolyte and this cathode helps to maintain a good cathode/electrolyte interface, whilst the nano-structured GDC phase introduced on the surface of the LSCM/YSZ backbone is advantageous to boost the electrochemical and catalytic properties of the cathode towards CO2 reduction using SOECs. Vacuum impregnation therefore offers an effective means to modify the microstructure of the LSCM/GDC material used as a cathode for high temperature CO2 electrolysis. With the doping of a Pd co-catalyst after GDC impregnation, the cathodic activity of the GDC impregnated LSCM material is further enhanced for high temperature CO2 electrolysis, and the 0.5 wt% Pd and GDC co-impregnated LSCM cathode achieves an Rp value of 0.24 Ω cm2 at OCV at 900 °C in a CO2-CO 70-30 mixture, a comparable level to that of a high performance Ni-YSZ cathode operated under identical conditions. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cathodes; Cermets; Durability; Electrodes; Electrolysis; Electrolytes; Impregnation; Manganese; Nickel; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Yttria stabilized zirconia; Zirconia; Catalytic properties; Cathodic activity; Competitive performance; Identical conditions; Nitrate solutions; Solid-oxide cells; Vacuum impregnation; Vacuum infiltration; Regenerative fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017572515

As the key device during the expansion and compression process in the Brayton power cycle, the turbine and compressor design and performance analysis is difficult for the strong nonlinear properties during the near critical region of S-CO2 medium. The design and analysis of the S-CO2 turbine and compressor is the key point for increasing the power device performance and operation security. As a result, this paper proposes a detail design and analysis method for turbine and compressor in the S-CO2 Brayton power cycle. The MW grade power cycle is used as the research project. The inlet and outlet parameters of the turbine and compressor are determined according to the power cycle scheme. Engineering thermodynamic principles combined with two-zone loss model are chosen to carry out the one-dimensional flow path design for the turbine and compressor respectively. Then the quasithree dimension design of the flow path is accomplished by stream curvature method. The three dimensional geometry structure of the impeller is designed in detail. On this basis, numerical simulation models of the turbine and compressor are established to analysis the flow field and structural strength vibration in detail. Moreover, the simulation results show that the isentropic efficiency of the compressor impeller is 96.9%. The maximum total displacements of the compressor and turbine impeller are 0.12 mm and 0.106 mm respectively. The maximum von Mises equivalent stresses of the compressor and turbine impeller are 372 MPa and 320 MPa respectively. The impeller can meet the strength safty requiments for the maximum stress values are much less than the yield stress of the material. © Copyright 2017 ASME.","Design and analysis; Nuclear power; Supercritical carbon dioxide; Turbomachinery","Brayton cycle; Carbon dioxide; Compressors; Design; Impellers; Machine design; Nuclear energy; Nuclear engineering; Nuclear fuels; Supercritical fluid extraction; Turbines; Turbomachinery; Vibration analysis; Yield stress; Design and analysis; Engineering thermodynamics; Isentropic efficiency; Nonlinear properties; Supercritical carbon; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Three dimensional geometry; Von Mises equivalent stress; Structural design",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032495253

A new drought index, standardized supply-demand water index (SSDI), has been proposed in this research. The SSDI describes drought from the view of water supply-demand relations using a simple water balance model. It was used to assess historical drought events in the middle and lower Jinsha river basin (MLJRB) located in the southwest China and applied to address the drought conditions in the MLJRB under current and future climates. The results showed the following: (1) The average drought area during 2001 to 2011 reached up to 9.9 × 103 km2, accounting for 35.4% of the whole farmland area in the MLJRB, which was about twice as the drought area during 1961 to 2000. The region for greater drought severity with more drought events and longer duration was mainly distributed in Dali, Chuxiong, Kunming, and Yuxi. (2) For the period 2021 to 2050, total drought area was projected to increase by 43.2%.

Based on a review of bionic technologies for building functions, structures, and materials, the present study analyzes applications and typical cases of bionic building energy efficiency and bionic green architecture. For example, utilizing the wisdom of nature in buildings, architectural innovations using bionic functions have been created based on the favorable natural ventilation system found in termite mounds. Moreover, passive construction technology using solar energy resources can not only improve the indoor thermal environment but also achieve low energy consumption for buildings. Drawing inspiration from mechanical properties, structural relationships, and the material performance of natural objects, and applying this to a building's structure or shape design, large span structures, such as suspension cable and thin shell structure, which imitate cobwebs and eggshell respectively, have been designed to improve the efficiency of building resources. Using polar bear fur, lotus leaves, and other natural animals and plants as bionic building materials, self-compensation, regulation, and maintenance mechanisms have been achieved on building surfaces, allowing the buildings to actively adapt to their environment, thus reflecting the symbiotic relationship between architecture and the environment, and achieving the green development of buildings with high efficiency and low energy consumption. In addition, based on ecological principles and climate-adaptive design rules, the present study proposes an overall design concept for bionic green architecture and further notes that, in future research, it will be necessary to implement the following: strengthen the integration and optimization of diverse green building technologies; manage the energy efficiency of bionic buildings throughout their life cycles; develop bionic technologies for building functions based on the principle of regional suitability; promote innovative bionic technologies for building structures based on the principle of green ecological coexistence; and strengthen the research, development, and application of bionic building materials that regulate, repair, clean, and protect themselves. In short, the development of bionic building energy efficiency and bionic green architecture should follow and respect natural laws. It is necessary to study the mechanisms used in biological systems, which, combined with modern building technologies, should be employed to support building innovation and to realize the rapid development of building energy efficiency and green buildings. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bionic building energy efficiency; Bionic function; Bionic green architecture; Bionic material; Bionic structure","Architectural design; Bionics; Building materials; Ecology; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Maintenance; Mammals; Plants (botany); Solar energy; Sustainable development; Ventilation; Architectural innovation; Bionic materials; Bionic structures; Building energy efficiency; Green architectures; Indoor thermal environments; Structural relationship; Symbiotic relationship; Energy efficiency",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014715509

In this study, the DNDC model was evaluated against observations and used to simulate the effect of plastic mulching on soil N2O emissions and crop growth. The DNDC model performed well in simulating temporal variations in N2O emissions and plant growth during the observation period, although it slightly underestimated the cumulative N2O emissions, and was able to simulate the effects of plastic mulching on N2O emissions and crop yield. Both the observations and simulations demonstrated that the application of plastic film increased cumulative N2O emissions and cotton lint yield compared with the non-mulched treatment. The sensitivity test showed that the N2O emissions and lint yield were sensitive to changes in climate and management practices, and the application of plastic film made the N2O emissions and lint yield less sensitive to changes in temperature and irrigation. Although the simulations showed that the beneficial impacts of plastic mulching on N2O emissions were not gained under high fertilizer and irrigation scenarios, our simulations suggest that the application of plastic film effectively reduced soil N2O emissions while promoting yields under suitable fertilizer rates and irrigation. Compared with the baseline scenario, future climate change significantly increased N2O emissions by 15–17% without significantly influencing the lint yields in the non-mulched treatment; in the mulched treatment, climate change significantly promoted the lint yield by 5–6% and significantly reduced N2O emissions by 14% in the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Overall, our results demonstrate that the application of plastic film is an efficient way to address increased N2O emissions and simultaneously enhance crop yield in the future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; DNDC; Lint yield; N2O emissions; Plastic film mulching","Climate models; Crops; Ecosystems; Fertilizers; Irrigation; Nitrogen oxides; Plastic films; Soils; Agricultural ecosystems; Agricultural practices; Denitrification decompositions (DNDC); DNDC; Lint yield; Management practices; Nitrous oxide emissions; Plastic film mulching; Climate change; fertilizer; nitrous oxide; plastic; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural practice; arid region; climate change; cotton; crop yield; decomposition; denitrification; growth response; mulching; nitrous oxide; plastic; polymer; soil emission; Article; China; climate change; crop; crop production; decomposition; denitrification; harvest; irrigation (agriculture); nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; plant growth; priority journal; rural area; simulation; soil; temperature; China; Gossypium hirsutum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015986879

Here, the CO2 reduction potential and economic impact of CO2 recovery of methane from a coalbed were evaluated at a CTO plant in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China. Emission reductions and capital, annual, and methane costs were analyzed basing on engineering data, empirical formulas, and assumptions. Cost analysis included the influence of a potential carbon tax. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted on the annual gross profit to parameters, including carbon tax, CO2 capture rate (CCR), pipeline distance, capital recovery factor, CO2 injection rate, operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) percentage, coal depth, and methane price. Results showed that an optimal CO2 capture rate is about 80%, taking into consideration total capital, annual, and methane costs. At this optimum CCR, the methane price was calculated as $0.12 Nm-3 and a total capital cost of $323.14 M, which also results in a 58% reduction in CO2 emissions. Reductions from CO2 sequestration and fuel substitution respectively account for 66% and 34% of the total emissions reductions. The carbon tax impact analysis suggests a carbon tax greater than $20 per tCO2 will maintain a profitable system with a range in CCR of 70-80%. The sensitivity analysis demonstrates that carbon tax, CCR, and pipeline distance have the greatest effects on annual gross profit. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal deposits; Cost benefit analysis; Cost engineering; Cost reduction; Costs; Economic analysis; Emission control; Fuels; Metal recovery; Pipelines; Profitability; Sensitivity analysis; Taxation; Capital recoveries; CO2 sequestration; Economic impacts; Emission reduction; Empirical formulas; Fuel substitution; Inner Mongolia autonomous regions; Operation and maintenance; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032992170

As the CSN data is intended to be used for the improvement of air quality and human health, it is important that high-quality speciated PM data are provided for the development of effective air pollution reduction strategies. There are several stages involved in the validation process of CSN data, from the site operators up to, and including, the SLT analysts, with several techniques used at each of these stages. The focus of this paper is on the data validation process performed at UCD, which begins with data integrity checks of electronic data and analysis results. Analyses are performed on the resulting data to identify outliers, swapped filters, and other issues with the data. During this process, atmospheric phenomenon can be identified as well as other conditions or events such as industrial emissions, fireworks, and dust storms that could influence PM2.5 samples locally or regionally across the States. The data are delivered to the SLTs for review and validation before being returned to UCD to be reformatted for delivery to AQS. UCD continues to make improvements to increase efficiency and data quality. While there are still challenges to overcome and improvements to be made, the lessons learned so far have resulted in significant improvements to the process both on a technical level and a practical level due to a better understanding of the data at each step through discussions with laboratory and SLT analysts. Beyond CSN, such information and recommended practices could be used to help collect and validate data in the air quality field and other disciplines. © 2017 Air and Waste Management Association.

However, the systems of both lakes started losing their capability due to a reduced CO2 partial pressure in the bottom waters, especially after installation of additional pipes in 2011. After initiation of a degassing operation, changes in CO2 profiles in the bottom layer of Lake Nyos over time showed that gas-poor shallow water has descended to the bottom, leaving little CO2 in the bottom water. The degassing system at Lake Monoun has completely lost its gas self-lift capability as the reduced CO2 partial pressure in the bottom water is too low to sustain the gas-lift system, and all the degassing pipes stopped working in 2010. This situation led to the accumulation of CO2 due to continued natural recharge of magmatic CO2. To compensate this recharge of gas, we installed a new deep water removal system that is driven by solar power at Lake Monoun in December 2013. This system does not need power lines, fuel or complicated maintenance, thus it is convenient for remote lakes such as lakes Monoun and Nyos. © 2017 The Author(s).",,"carbon dioxide; crater lake; degassing; dissolved gas; future prospect; gas flow; lake water; water chemistry; Cameroon; Lake Monoun; Lake Nyos; North West Region; West Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020232878

A catalytic converter is composed of a catalytically active material coated onto a ceramic honeycomb-structured substrate. Honeycomb substrates play the role of ensuring intimate contact between the exhaust gas and the catalyst within the substrate’s flow channels. In recent years, high-load test cycles have been introduced which require increased robustness to maintain low emissions during the wide range of load changes. Therefore, it is extremely important to increase the probability of contact between the exhaust gas and catalyst. To achieve this contact, several measures were considered such as increasing active sites or geometrical surface areas by utilizing substrates with higher cell densities or larger volumes. These measures, however, led to greater consumption of precious metals and decreased vehicle power by increasing pressure losses. Therefore, a new concept substrate, which focuses on gas flow redistribution, has been developed to overcome these negatives. The key points of this development include a compound cell structure design which consists of a higher cell density area in the center portion of the substrate completely surrounded by a lower cell density area and optimization of the cell design for each portion to improve the efficiency of the catalytic converter. As a result, this newly developed honeycomb substrate shifts the trend line relationship of catalytic performance and pressure loss to a higher level. In addition, it reduces precious metal usage, as well as the volume of catalytic converters while maintaining catalytic performance equivalent to that of a conventional honeycomb substrate (400 cell density).

While simple statistics have difficulty identifying the effect, here a well-known eigenvector technique is used to overcome several specific challenges that result from a limited research region, complex topography, and multiple atmospheric circulation patterns. This approach is applied to investigate the influence of the isolated Yatir forest, at the north edge of Israel's Negev Desert. It was found that this forest does influence the daily climate, primarily seen in the main pattern of the empirical orthogonal function (EOF) of temperature and humidity. The EOF explains 93% and 80%, respectively, of the total variance in the data. Although the Yatir forest is small, it is significant in regulating the climate in the nearby surroundings, as it is located in a sharp transition area toward an arid climate. The results are presented as maps of correlation and regression between the normalized principal component time series of each pattern as well as other time series of the raw data and spatially interpolated data stations. Analysis of short-term campaign measurements around the Yatir forest supports the EOF results, and shows the forest's influence to the south, mainly during nighttime when the forest becomes cooler than its surroundings.

Studies on the climatically responsive urban configuration commonly conducted through the empirical and physical modelling approach. However, in this context recently, computer simulation as numerical modelling approach has been broadly applied by scholars. Besides overcoming the limitation of time, spaces and cost, computer simulation offers an effective solution to perform hypothetical studies. As a new approach over empirical and physical modelling approach, scholars frequently perform a comparison of both computer simulation and field observation approach. It shows that even though the computer simulation has been commonly used, but the validation is still questioned. This paper presents not only the comparison of computer simulation with observation data but also empirical model equations. The hypothetical urban configurations situated in Kuala Lumpur City were simulated by using ENVI-met V. 3.1 microclimatic model. Two empirical model equations of maximum urban heat island developed by Oke were used to compare with computer simulation. A 24-h air temperature data is presented for the simulation and field observation comparison. The results indicate the significant correlation between the two comparisons. This study verifies and strengthens the validation of the computer simulation as a reliable approach in urban configuration and microclimate studies.

Yet, there has been a lack of empirical evidence showing this at the local scale with different plant configurations and climatic regions. We studied the impact of urban park and forest vegetation on the levels of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ground-level ozone (O3) while controlling for temperature during early summer (May) using passive samplers in Baltimore, USA. Concentrations of O3 were significantly lower in tree-covered habitats than in adjacent open habitats, but concentrations of NO2 did not differ significantly between tree-covered and open habitats. Higher temperatures resulted in higher pollutant concentrations and NO2 and O3 concentration were negatively correlated with each other. Our results suggest that the role of trees in reducing NO2 concentrations in urban parks and forests in the Mid-Atlantic USA is minor, but that the presence of tree-cover can result in lower O3 levels compared to similar open areas. Our results further suggest that actions aiming at local air pollution mitigation should consider local variability in vegetation, climate, micro-climate, and traffic conditions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Ecosystem services; Nitrogen dioxide; Ozone; Urban trees; Urban vegetation","Air pollution; Air quality; Ecosystems; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Vegetation; Ecosystem services; Ground-level ozone; Local air pollutions; Nitrogen dioxides; Pollutant concentration; Traffic conditions; Urban trees; Urban vegetation; Forestry; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); ecosystem service; greenspace; high temperature; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; perception; phytoremediation; pollutant removal; pollution control; temperature effect; tree; urban ecosystem; vegetation structure; air pollution; Article; canopy; light; Maryland; microclimate; priority journal; recreational park; solar radiation; temperature; tree; United States; urban area; vegetation; Baltimore; Maryland; Mid-Atlantic States; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029183713

Use of improved biomass cookstoves (ICS) has the potential to reduce household air pollution (HAP). Objectives As part of an evaluation to identify ICS for use in Kenya, we collected indoor air and personal air samples to assess differences between traditional cookstoves (TCS) and ICS. Methods We conducted a cross-over study in 2012 in two Kenyan villages; up to six different ICS were installed in 45 households during six two-week periods. Forty-eight hour kitchen measurements of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and carbon monoxide (CO) were collected for the TCS and ICS. Concurrent personal CO measurements were conducted on the mother and one child in each household. We performed descriptive analysis and compared paired measurements between baseline (TCS only) and each ICS. Results The geometric mean of 48-hour baseline PM2.5and CO concentrations in the kitchen was 586 μg/m3(95% CI: 460, 747) and 4.9 ppm (95% CI: 4.3, 5.5), respectively. For each ICS, the geometric mean kitchen air pollutant concentration was lower than the TCS: median reductions were 38.8% (95% CI: 29.5, 45.2) for PM2.5and 27.1% (95% CI: 17.4, 40.3) for CO, with statistically significant relationships for four ICS. We also observed a reduction in personal exposures to CO with ICS use. Conclusions We observed a reduction in mean 48-hour PM2.5and CO concentrations compared to the TCS; however, concentrations for both pollutants were still consistently higher than WHO air quality guidelines. Our findings illustrate that ICS tested in real-world settings can reduce exposures to HAP, but implementation of cleaner fuels and related stove technologies may also be necessary to optimize public health benefits. © 2016","Carbon monoxide; Cookstove; Household air pollution; Particulate matter","Air quality; Carbon monoxide; Exposure controls; Fuels; Heating; Indoor air pollution; Kitchens; Air pollutant concentrations; Cookstove; Descriptive analysis; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Particulate Matter; Personal exposures; Quality guidelines; Real world setting; Particles (particulate matter); carbon monoxide; carbon monoxide; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; concentration (composition); cooking appliance; particulate matter; rural area; adolescent; adult; Article; concentration (parameters); controlled study; cooking; cookstove; descriptive research; environmental exposure; female; human; indoor air pollution; Kenya; kitchen; particulate matter; rural area; air pollutant; analysis; cooking; crossover procedure; devices; household; indoor air pollution; infant; middle aged; newborn; particle size; particulate matter; preschool child; rural population; young adult; Kenya; Adolescent; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Carbon Monoxide; Child, Preschool; Cooking; Cross-Over Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Household Articles; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Kenya; Middle Aged; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Rural Population; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028247269

However, documentation of the health benefits of lowering air pollution levels, which would support the biological plausibility of those past statistical associations, are not as well developed. A better understanding of the aftereffects of interventions to reduce air pollution is needed in order to: 1) better document the benefits of lowered air pollution; and, 2) identify the types of reductions that most effectively provide health benefits. Methods This study analyzes daily health and pollution data from three major cities in Israel that have undergone pollution control interventions to reduce sulfur emissions from combustion sources. In this work, the hypothesis tested is that transitions to cleaner fuels are accompanied by a decreased risk of daily cardiovascular and respiratory mortalities. Interrupted time series regression models are applied in order to test whether the cleaner air interventions are associated with a statistically significant reduction in mortality. Results In the multi-city meta-analysis we found statistically significant reductions of 13.3% [CI − 21.9%, − 3.8%] in cardiovascular mortality, and a borderline significant (p = 0.06) reduction of 19.0% [CI − 35.1%, 1.1%] in total mortality. Conclusions Overall, new experiential evidence is provided consistent with human health benefits being associated with interventions to reduce air pollution.

Exposure to PM2.5, one of the primary air pollutants in many cities in China, is highly correlated with various adverse health impacts and ultimately represents a cost for society. The aim of this study is to assess health impacts and external costs related to PM2.5 pollution in Beijing, China with different baseline concentrations and valuation methods. The idea is to provide a reasonable estimate of the total health impacts and external cost due to PM2.5 pollution, as well as a quantification of the relevant uncertainty. PM2.5 concentrations were retrieved for the entire 2012 period in 16 districts of Beijing. The various PM2.5 related health impacts were identified and classified to avoid double counting. Exposure-response coefficients were then obtained from literature. Both the value of statistical life (VSL) and the amended human capital (AHC) approach were applied for external costs estimation, which could provide the upper and lower bound of the external costs due to PM2.5. To fully understand the uncertainty levels, the external cost distribution was determined via Monte Carlo simulation based on the uncertainty of the parameters such as PM2.5 concentration, exposure-response coefficients, and economic cost per case. The results showed that the external costs were equivalent to around 0.3% (AHC, China's guideline: C0 = 35 μg/m3) to 0.9% (VSL, WHO guideline: C0 = 10 μg/m3) of regional GDP depending on the valuation method and on the assumed baseline PM2.5 concentration (C0). Among all the health impacts, the economic loss due to premature deaths accounted for more than 80% of the overall external costs. The results of this study could help policymakers prioritizing the PM2.5 pollution control interventions and internalize the external costs through the application of economic policy instruments. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Economic loss; Externality; Fine particulate matter; Health impacts; Uncertainty analysis","Air pollution; Cost estimating; Economic analysis; Health; Losses; Monte Carlo methods; Pollution control; Uncertainty analysis; Base-line concentrations; Economic loss; Externality; Fine particulate matter; Health impact; Response coefficient; Upper and lower bounds; Value of statistical lives; Cost benefit analysis; aerosol composition; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); economic analysis; economic policy; health impact; Monte Carlo analysis; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; pollution control; sulfur dioxide; uncertainty analysis; air pollution; Article; China; economic evaluation; environmental exposure; epidemiological data; health care cost; health care policy; health impact assessment; Monte Carlo method; particulate matter; premature mortality; quantitative analysis; social support; uncertainty; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; city; economics; human; particulate matter; statistics and numerical data; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; air pollutant; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Health Impact Assessment; Humans; Particulate Matter; Uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017358263

This is in particular the case in the Paris region: as the road network is increasingly congested, leading to more and more frequent heavy air pollution episodes, local authorities seek to promote ridesharing in order to improve travel conditions and mitigate the environmental impact of road traffic. This research seeks to assess through sensitivity analysis what is the potential of ridesharing regarding these two points, namely reducing congestion and mitigating pollutant emissions, in the case of the Paris region. The effects of various ridesharing scenarios will be investigated by using an integrated transport land-use model and by considering each of the following mechanisms successively: 1) traffic assignment, 2) mode choice, 3) distribution. Results include a quantitative assessment of what level of ridesharing is reached to observe significant improvements regarding congestion and pollutant emissions, and on which trip segments (e.g., purpose and range) should one focus the efforts to do so. A step by step decomposition of the effects will also help better understand the various implications of ridesharing on the urban system as a whole. © 2017 The Authors.

Then, empirical cumulative distribution function of data is found by Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test. A peak detection algorithm is used to estimate speed centers of the clusters. Since the estimation model has linear and non-linear components, the estimation of variance values and kernel weights are found by a nonlinear Least Square approach with separation of parameters property. Finally, the tracking of former and latter estimations of a road is calculated by using Scalar Kalman Filtering with scalar state - scalar observation generality level.

This article attempts to demonstrate the potential of spatial planning to reduce the UHI effect and, hence, to contribute to climate change adaptation in compact urban areas. After a brief review of the relevant literature, the article focuses on one case study within the compact urban area of the city of Thessaloniki. The geographical, socio-economic and urban form data of the study area and its subsequent vulnerability to UHI were initially assessed. Based on these features, a local spatial planning strategy is proposed, and the study proceeds to a detailed amendment of the land use plan, within part of the vulnerable zone. This takes into account the existing urban form, the lack of resources and the availability of the spatial planning tools within the Greek spatial planning system. The main purpose of this article is to highlight the fact that, even in urban areas where the potential for intervention seems to be marginal, because of their existing form, the complexities of the local planning system and resource limitations, improvements to the UHI effect and adaptation to climate change can be achieved by better land use planning and urban design. © 2017 by the author.","Climate change; Compact urban area; Green infrastructure; Spatial planning; Sustainable development; Thessaloniki; Urban heat island","adaptive management; climate change; greenspace; heat island; infrastructure; land use planning; planning system; spatial planning; urban area; urban design; urban planning; vulnerability; Central Macedonia; Greece; Thessaloniki [Central Macedonia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013361036

This study investigates why local governments have adopted various energy and climate change policy instruments despite the non-excludability of climate benefits. This paper advances theories of institutional collective action (ICA) and policy diffusion by testing ICA based hypotheses that local officials are able to overcome collective action problems to the extent that the costs of these initiatives are minimized through policy network interactions, the extent to which climate action produces localized benefits or compliments local environmental, development or growth management efforts, and the extent to which energy and climate protection efforts generate selective benefits to elected and appointed local government officials who advance their career interests depending on the existing configurations of political system institutions. Analysis of adoptions of the Climate Protection Agreements by Florida Cities indicates larger cities are more likely to adopt climate agreement, while district elections decrease the likelihood of climate policy adoption. Moreover, economic development rather than growth management or environmental problem situation is linked to climate initiatives. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate protection; Collective action; Environmental policy; Policy diffusion; Policy tools; Sustainable energy","Climate change; Diffusion barriers; Environmental management; Public policy; Sustainable development; Climate protection; Collective action; Environmental policy; Policy diffusions; Policy tools; Sustainable energy; Environmental protection",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019589771

In this context, full electric vehicles represent a solution with the capability of local pollutant emission free driving and zero tank-to-wheel CO2 emissions. One of the major limitations of battery electric vehicles is the limited range of the vehicle especially under real life conditions. Therefore, technical solutions that reduce the electric energy consumption are of high interest especially for electrified powertrain concepts. Within this paper, FEV presents a battery electric vehicle motored by two electric motors mounted respectively on the front and rear axles. For this electric vehicle topology, FEV developed a dedicated axle torque split algorithm to optimize the powertrain efficiency and improve the vehicle electric range with focus on real life driving conditions. The functionality takes into account the system operational constraints (e.g. electric motor continuous and peak power limits and TCS-based vehicle traction limits), driving comfort as well as manoeuvrability limits to optimize the overall system behaviour. The overall system is tested within a dedicated Model-In-the-Loop 3D plant model capable of longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics including MATLAB/Simulink and IPG CarMaker®. The results show a reduction of total energy demand by 1.6%to 2.9%in WLTC comparing to different baselines. In terms of driving dynamic improvement, a noticeable increase of the launch acceleration on a µ-split ground can be detected in a certain test case. © 2017 MOBI - Mobility, Logistics and Automotive Technology Research Centre.","AWD; Energy Consumption; Torque Vectoring; Traction Control","All wheel drive vehicles; Battery electric vehicles; Carbon dioxide; Drive axles; Electric automobiles; Electric traction; Energy utilization; Front axles; Secondary batteries; Traction control; Traction motors; AWD electric vehicles; Driving conditions; Electric energy consumption; Operational constraints; Pollutant emission; Sustainable mobility; Technical solutions; Torque vectoring; Powertrains",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050092181

Cassava is viewed as an important and highly attractive nonedible feedstock for the production of biofuels. In this paper, a game-theoretic approach is proposed to explore decision behavior within a cassava-based bioethanol supply chain under the condition of yield uncertainty. In addition, a production cost sharing contract is proposed to overcome the double marginalization effect due to competition between supply chain players. With data from China's cassava-based bioethanol industry, the paper analyzes the effects of the farmer's capacity, risk aversion, yield uncertainty, the conversion ratio, the bioethanol's market price and ethanol plant's operation cost on optimal decisions within the supply chain and its overall performance. In addition, the effectiveness of the proposed production cost sharing contract is tested, and the results show that it can enhance the supply of cassava, increase the utility of the whole supply chain and reduce the level of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The implications are set out for policy makers regarding how to promote the development of the biofuel industry, to guarantee the supply of feedstock, to reduce GHG emissions and to promote rural development. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Bioethanol; Cassava; Coordination; GHG emission; Supply chain","Cost effectiveness; Costs; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Game theory; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Plants (botany); Regional planning; Supply chains; Bioethanol industry; Bioethanol supply chains; Cassava; Coordination; Double marginalization; GHG emission; Optimal decisions; Rural development; Bioethanol; alternative energy; biofuel; emission; energy market; game theory; greenhouse gas; marginalization; performance assessment; price dynamics; production cost; rural development; shrub; supply chain management; uncertainty analysis; China; Manihot esculenta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008675909

This paper uses detailed energy consumption data subdivided within each fuel type and sector-specific emission factors, to calculate both direct and indirect energy-related CO2 emissions for China's provinces, and offers provincially-targeted policy proposals on emission reductions. The results uncover large divergences in calculation of provincial CO2 emissions between production-based and consumption-based accounting approaches. Considering the large amount of interprovincial CO2 emission transfers embodied in secondary energy deployment, the consumption-based accounting performs better in reflecting the actual features and responsibilities of carbon emissions in the provinces of China. From the consumption perspective, Shandong, Hebei, Jiangsu, Inner Mongolia, Guangdong, Henan, Liaoning and Shanxi contributed to the majority of China's carbon emission growth during the period of 1996–2013, while Xinjiang, Sichuan, Anhui, Tianjin and Hunan were playing an increasingly important role. These two groups of provinces should be regarded as the key regions for national emissions abatement. Meanwhile, the energy industry was the top sectoral contributor to CO2 emissions growth in most provinces, while service and household sectors made increasingly significant impacts on driving up provincial emissions. Together with ongoing efforts in the energy sector, the mitigation of CO2 emissions in service and household sectors deserves much more attention, especially in the transportation and urban household sectors. Furthermore, the temporal trends of carbon emissions in various provinces, as well as their factor and sectoral driving forces, varied greatly with each other. Therefore, each of the provinces should formulate emission reduction policies according to their own situation, and target the key driving factors and sectors of carbon emissions at the current stage or in the near future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","China; CO2 emissions; Consumption-based accounting; Emission driving forces; LMDI","Climate change; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Urban transportation; China; Driving force analysis; Driving forces; Emission reduction; Emission reduction policies; Emissions abatements; Energy consumption datum; LMDI; Carbon dioxide; abatement cost; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; emission inventory; energy use; household structure; quantitative analysis; Anhui; China; Guangdong; Hebei; Henan; Hunan; Jiangsu; Liaoning; Mongolia; Nei Monggol; Shandong; Shanxi; Sichuan; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018980213

The potential risk to the energy supply security and the pressure of national greenhouse gas emissions reduction clearly indicates the JSLC's need to lower its dependency on imported fossil fuels and electricity. This article presents a feasibility analysis on the available hybrid energy system based on the renewable energy availability and local electricity demand estimation in 2020 through HOMER model. The simulation results indicate that cost of energy (COE) of the three proposed options are 0.127, 0.033 and 0.123/kWh, respectively. It also shows that the proposed hybrid renewable energy systems can reduce carbon emissions by 40–70% compared to electricity from the existing power grid. A sensitivity analysis reveals that the COE has a significant positive relationship with carbon price and discount rate, whereas carbon price shows a significantly distinct impact on the COE for different options considered. The optimization results also show that a grid-connected renewable power system comprised of wind power and natural gas power plant is the most economic and environment-friendly energy supply option for JSLC. However, a hybrid RE system with a local energy storage facility can better guarantee the energy supply safety considering the special function and security needs of the JSLC.

Challenges in energy storage, however, always complicate the design of renewable energy-dominated power generation systems. This study attempt to provide a solution to the energy storage problem through the synergy of both the power supply and demand sides. Based on local natural energy resources endowments, this paper applies the hybrid optimization model for multiple energy resources and load types to analyse the feasibility of satisfying energy demand. To verify the model's technological and economic feasibility, this research applies its synergy model to a 2.8 km2 isolated island in the South China Sea. The simulation results demonstrate that the cost of energy and net present cost of the power supply system are $0.212/kW h and $127 M when hydrogen energy storage equipment is used, and $0.178/kW h and $101 M when traditional-battery energy storage equipment is utilized. This study also reveals that using flywheels to supplement the hydrogen and traditional-battery energy storage equipment could reduce the cost of energy by 5.6% and 3.4%, respectively. In addition, power system demand-side management can further reduce the cost of energy by approximately 20% for all technology scenarios considered in this study. A carbon emissions analysis demonstrates that the carbon reduction rates of the proposed power systems are between 87.7% and 95.1% compared with a fossil-energy based power system.

In addition to the thick, unstable salt layers posing borehole stability and casing issues, a primary challenge in the appraisal of the faulted Coquina reserves is the handling of immense downhole losses in the weaker and occasionally fractured carbonate layers just below the salt strata. Although the bottomhole pressure limitations posed by conventional drilling have been eliminated by Managed Pressure Drilling attempts, the transition has also brought along a new set of technical challenges such as: Instability in wells while tripping and high fluid losses while restoring control • Failed attempts to regain control in loss zones by pumping lost circulation material/cement into • fractures Difficulty in zonal isolation, even with Managed Pressure Cementing • Pore plugging and reservoir damage due to placement of cement as lost circulation material • Wellbore depletion and differential sticking tendency during shut-in time • Limitations on the use of Positive Displacement Motors due to additional pressure fluctuations • The paper reviews the above challenges as planning and technological gaps suppressing the production prospects and investigates the application of Pressurized Mud Cap Drilling and Constant Bottomhole Pressure techniques with controlled Gas-Influx as an effective approach in mitigating the constraints by aligning the bottomhole pressure and the pore pressure.

The degree of air pollution in the Jing-Jin-Ji region is so severe that it may impose feedback on local climate. Reference evapotranspiration (ET0) plays a significant role in the estimation of crop water requirements, as well as in studies on climate variation and change. Since the traditional correlation analysis cannot capture the causality, we apply the convergent cross mapping method (CCM) in this study to observationally investigate whether the air pollution impacts ET0. The results indicate that southwest regions of Jing-Jin-Ji always suffer higher PM2.5 concentration than north regions through the whole year, and correlation analysis suggests that PM2.5 concentration has a significant negative effect on ET0 in most cities. The causality detection with CCM quantitatively demonstrates the significantly causative influence of PM2.5 concentration on ET0, higher PM2.5 concentration decreasing ET0. However, CCM analysis suggests that PM2.5 concentration has a relatively weak causal influence on ET0 while the correlation analysis gives the near zero correlation coefficient in Zhangjiakou city, indicating that the causative influence of PM2.5 concentration on ET0 is better revealed with CCM method than the correlation analysis. Considering that ET0 is strongly associated with crop water requirement, the amount of water for agricultural irrigation could be reduced at high PM2.5 concentrations. These findings can be utilized to improve the efficiency of water resources utilization, and reduce the exploiting amount of groundwater in the Jing-Jin-Ji region, although PM2.5 is detrimental to human health. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Agricultural irrigation; Causality detection; Correlation analysis; PM2.5 concentration; Reference evapotranspiration","ground water; air pollutant; particulate matter; atmospheric pollution; climate change; concentration (composition); correlation; detection method; dispersion; evapotranspiration; irrigation; mapping method; particulate matter; pollution effect; water use; water use efficiency; air pollution; Article; China; city; combustion; correlation analysis; crop; evapotranspiration; heating; irrigation (agriculture); meteorology; particulate matter; plant leaf; priority journal; solar radiation; summer; temperature; water supply; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; particle size; physiology; China; Hebei; Jingjinji; North China Plain; Zhangjiakou; Agricultural Irrigation; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Crops, Agricultural; Particle Size; Particulate Matter; Plant Transpiration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021720758

MOFs 1-3 are stable in pH = 5-11, 2-11, 3-11 aqueous solution respectively for at least 24 h at room temperature. Although H4TCS absorbs only UV light, MOFs 1-3 absorb both UV and visible light in broad ranges (250-800 nm) and absorb more visible light than the ligand BPY. The rapid anodic photocurrent responses of MOFs 1-3 under UV and visible light illumination were observed. The photocurrent densities increase in the order of MOF 3 &lt; 1 &lt; 2 under visible light illumination (430 nm). The band gaps of MOFs 1-3 determined based on UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra and electrochemical (EC) analysis are 1.28, 1.35 and 0.67 eV, respectively. MOF 1 is able to photocatalyze the reduction of CO2 to CH4 under visible light, producing CH4 (1.44 μmol g-1 in 8 h), which is unprecedented in MOFs. The catalytic activity of MOF 1 (0.75 μmol g-1 after 4 h) under the irradiation of a 300 W xenon lamp is significantly better than those of MOFs 2 and 3 (0.14 μmol g-1 after 4 h). The band structures, density of states and band gaps of MOFs 1-3 were calculated by the GGA-PBE and GGA-PBE+U method implemented in VASP code. The calculations show that all the three compounds can be viewed as bulk intermediate band (IB) materials. The density of states of the IB in MOF 1 is high, which could suppress the non-radiative recombination. The density of states of the IB levels in MOFs 2 and 3 are low, making these levels very effective recombination centres, thus jeopardizing the photocatalytic activities of MOFs 2 and 3. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental results and explain the photocatalytic activity differences. This study is the first to successfully address the question of how the types of unpaired electron containing electron-rich metal ions (i.e. Cu(ii), Co(ii), Ni(ii)) affect the band gaps and band structures of MOFs and thus their photoelectronic properties. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Band structure; Catalyst activity; Crystalline materials; Electric lamps; Energy gap; Java programming language; Metal ions; Metals; Nickel; Photocatalysis; Solutions; Anodic photocurrents; Metal organic framework; Metalorganic frameworks (MOFs); Non-radiative recombinations; Photocatalytic activities; Photoelectronic properties; Recombination centres; UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra; Light",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021761540

In line with previous research studies, the economic cost is the most important criterion that was considered. Additionally, the external cost of emissions was included as a second criterion. In order to satisfy the energy conservation and emission reduction target, the paper contributes with an optimization approach of the provincial distribution of natural gas with the aim to minimize the comprehensive costs.

Here, the reaction over a series of zeolite L-supported platinum catalysts was systematically investigated to study the promoting role of potassium. The results of activity tests showed that controlled addition of potassium promoter to Pt/L catalyst was beneficial for the catalytic activity and selectivity. It was observed that cage encapsulation by zeolite pores could stabilize Pt nano-particles even at severe reaction conditions. Furthermore, X-ray absorption near edge structure and X-ray photoelectron spectra results demonstrated that the chemical state of platinum was altered by the additional potassium promoter, providing evidence for the formation of Pt-O(OH)-K interfacial sites. Thereafter, the Pt-O(OH)-K interfaces, acting as main active sites to adsorb CO2 and produce bridge-bonded formate intermediates, were identified by a set of in-situ diffuse reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and microcalorimetry measurements.

Its economic growth greatly relies on natural resources, especially fossil fuels, which can lead to large quantities of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In this study, which is based on the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories, we systematically estimated the economy-related GHG emissions in Russia over the period of 1998–2013 in terms of energy consumption emissions, industrial process emissions, animal husbandry emissions, and fugitive emissions. The proportion and variations in the different emission categories were analyzed in the Russian context. The inverted U-shaped relationship between the GDP per capita and economy-related GHG emissions per capita was tested, and the results supported the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis under a business-as-usual scenario. Our estimation indicated that Russia will reach its turning point in 10 years if its economic growth rate remains stable. Since optimizing the energy structure and improving the energy efficiency and changing industrial structure will have a positive effect on GHG emission reduction in Russia, the Russian government needs to guide its economic development to reach its EKC turning point through the implementation of effective policies, instead of waiting for the turning point. This study analyzed the impact of the economic development on GHG emissions in Russia and will serve as a reference for countries and regions that are at this stage of the economic transformation process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Economic development; Environmental Kuznets Curve; Greenhouse gas emissions; Russia","Climate change; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Economic development; Economic growth rate; Economic transformation; Environmental Kuznets curves; Greenhouse gas inventory; Industrial processs; Industrial structures; Russia; Industrial economics; animal husbandry; climate change; economic development; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; Gross Domestic Product; industrial emission; industrial structure; Kuznets curve; natural resource; policy implementation; Russian Federation; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013339874

This basin is encompassed by the Bohai Sea economic zone where a large volume of CO2 is emitted directly into the atmosphere without any treatment. Meanwhile, most of the oil and gas provinces in this basin are facing the selection of tertiary recovery technologies after the completion of water flooding. CO2 enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR) is an optimal choice for achieving both a reduction in CO2 emissions and enhanced (or improved) oil recovery. In this paper, an evaluation of the CO2-EOR and CO2 storage potential was carried out at the reservoir scale, based on an established oil reservoir database from numerous data sources, to provide the basis investigating CO2-EOR site selection and regional CO2 emission reduction in China. Moreover, an assessment scheme for the oil reservoirs in the Bohai Bay Basin was also proposed. The results showed that 613 CO2-EOR candidate oil reservoirs, including 354 miscible CO2-EOR candidate oil reservoirs and 259 immiscible CO2-EOR candidate oil reservoirs were identified by applying the screening methodology to 2,891 oil reservoirs in the Bohai Bay Basin. It was predicted that 683 Mt of additional oil can be produced from the CO2-EOR candidate oil reservoirs, and simultaneously 1,345 Mt of CO2 would be incidentally stored in these candidate oil reservoirs. Furthermore, the most prospective area is the miscible CO2-EOR candidate oil reservoirs in the Shengli oil and gas province, where 140 Mt oil could be produced with the CO2-EOR and the injection and incidental storage of 225 Mt of CO2. © 2017","Bohai Bay Basin; CCS; China; CO2-EOR; Storage potential","Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Emission control; Gas emissions; Oil well flooding; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Site selection; Well flooding; Bohai Bay Basin; China; CO2 emission reduction; CO2-EOR; Enhanced oil recovery; Oil and gas provinces; Recovery technology; Storage potential; Enhanced recovery; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; enhanced oil recovery; fluid injection; hydrocarbon reservoir; oil production; reservoir flooding; storage; Bohai Sea; Bohaiwan Basin; China; Shandong; Shengli Field",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030864448

The fuel blend of B10W40 also demonstrated the most effective function in reducing the emissions of PM10 and PM2.5 in the volume by 59.4% and 57.7%, respectively. Moreover, the emissions of nitrogen oxides decreased with the blending of B10W10-B10W40 (13.9–28.5%), while the brake specific fuel consumption was substantially increased (5.69–13.4%). The overall biological toxicity of PM10 generated from the fuel tested in this study was determined according to Single Cell Gel Electrophoresis assay in human alveolar basal epithelial A549 cells and micronucleus assay in CHO-K1 cells. In addition, the volume of more than 20% waste-cooking oil (B10W20 and B10W40) significantly reduced diesel-induced genotoxicity in lung cells and micronucleus formation in CHO-K1 cells.

Considering our current scientific understanding of climate change have been developed into a new level, traditional water utility planning methods, based on an assumption of stationarity, are being fundamentally challenged. It is encouraging that many water utilities, recognizing the limitations of stationarity, are broadening their perspective on climate issues and deliberating new planning methods to deal with conditions of pervasive climatic uncertainty. This paper elaborates steps and processes of a water utility planning approach which is incorporated into water sector (water supply and drainage) of Wuhan. With the Asian Development Bank's financial fund in 2010, the city water utility planners developed a framework and a series of investment decisions through a ""bottom-up"" method involving Wuhan staff and stakeholders in workshops. An essential lesson draw from this case study is that initiative to increase climate resilience does not need to wait for advancements of future climate conditions study or detailed climate scenarios to be developed or for those scenarios to be incorporated into utility plans. The framework for ranking and identifying impacts and vulnerabilities was derived from widely accepted international methodologies and tailored to suit local conditions. In this way, it takes account of the situation on the ground, including the local perceptions of both conditions and needs, the existing plans, and the need to achieve consensus for investments in climate change adaptation. Finally this paper emphasizes that in order to meet specific needs, decision makers have to select appropriate methodology to suit the circumstances. © 2017 The Authors.","climate uncertainty; planning method; urban water utility","Decision making; Investments; Planning; Water supply; Asian Development Bank; Climate change adaptation; Climate scenarios; climate uncertainty; Investment decisions; Planning method; Urban waters; Water supply and drainages; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029851193

A reservoir simulation study was undertaken to investigate the feasibility of using horizontal multifractured wells in low permeability miscible floods. A reservoir model was developed for the area of interest and was historymatched with the primary production data from the field. The model was then used to illustrate the CO2 miscible flood potential by quantifying the incremental recovery over the primary production scenario. Compositional modeling was used in the study to evaluate CO2 flooding feasibility and efficiency. A holistic workflow including PVT modeling, petrophysical analysis, geomodeling, and hydraulic fracture modeling, provided integrated input into the reservoir model. Continuous CO2 flooding was explored as an operating strategy. Furthermore, water alternating gas (WAG) cases were designed and run as a more realistic and cost-effective method of implementing miscible flooding. Based on the history-matched model, sensitivity analyses were conducted on hydraulic fracture geometry, well spacing, injection patterns and operating conditions for the primary production scenario, continuous CO2 flooding and WAG scenarios. Field surveillance and observations during the history-matching process showed that the wells had undergone damage from scaling. Sensitivity analysis showed that 300ft to 400ft cluster spacing resulted in the highest oil production during the first 10 years. Interdependent parameters such as well spacing and fracture half-length were studied together; this sensitivity review showed that the differential oil recovery from 128 acres to 160 acres was larger than that from 160 acres to 213 acres, leading to the recommendation that 160 acres could be the optimized well spacing. In the optimized design, the continuous CO2 injection case showed an incremental oil recovery of 22% (compared to primary production). The CO2 utilization factor was between 7 and 8, which was consistent with the reported value from literature. WAG sensitivity analysis showed that longer hydraulic fractures did not necessarily improve WAG efficiency, but led to earlier CO2 breakthrough. This observation confirmed our early suspicion that smaller hydraulic fracturing treatment could be a more cost-effective design for miscible flooding in this reservoir. In addition, sweep efficiency and recovery were sensitive to WAG ratio, but not to injection slug size in each cycle. The current study sheds light on the feasibility of conducting a CO2 miscible flood using horizontal multi-fractured wells in low permeability reservoirs - a topic that is yet to be explored widely in petroleum engineering literature and in the industry. Incremental production that can be expected from a miscible CO2 flood is estimated and recommendations are provided for optimal well spacing, WAG ratio and operating constraints to help determine a viable field development plan.

The model is also simulated with the traffic data of Beijing in China. Findings – Theoretical results ensure that restriction of the passport is not the sole reason that may produce illegal trucks, and other measures need to be taken to solve the traffic problems. And in the long run, increasing fines has a greater effect than strengthening supervision frequency on illegal trucks reduction. Originality/value – From city distribution perspective, this paper studied freight group behavior under FTRP. This paper also applied the Agent modeling method to build a model of urban distribution system in the FTRP. © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Agent; City distribution; Freight group behaviour; Freight traffic restriction policy; Traffic planning","Agents; Automobiles; Crime; Motor transportation; Trucks; City distribution; Design/methodology/approach; Dynamic mechanism; Freight group behaviour; Freight traffic; Restriction policy; Traffic planning; Urban distribution systems; Traffic congestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85034830843

In contrast to the use of unselective monometallic Ni/SiO2 for catalyzing deoxygenation, hydrogenation, and C–C hydrogenolysis reactions, bimetallic 5%Ni–2.5%Re/SiO2 improved the intrinsic reaction rate of the hydrodeoxygenation reaction by a factor of 6, with the turnover frequency for selective deoxygenation to toluene increased by four times, while that for C–C hydrogenolysis to methane was reduced by one-half. Characterization results from X-ray diffraction, Raman, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy of CO adsorption, H2 temperature-programmed reduction, and CO chemisorption indicate that adding Re increased Ni dispersion and resulted in Ni–Re surface alloy formation after reduction. The presence of Re in the surface alloy breaks the continuous Ni surface into smaller ensembles (geometric effect) and reduces the d-band electron density of Ni (electronic effect). Results from density functional theory calculations indicate that the Ni–Re neighboring site is the active site for breaking the C–O bond by adsorbing the O atom on Re and the phenyl ring on the neighboring Ni atoms, which facilitates deoxygenation to toluene. The reduced Ni ensemble size inhibits the hydrogenolysis of the C–C bond by destabilizing the transition state, whereas the reduction of the electronic density in d states of Ni weakens the adsorption of the phenyl ring, and both contribute to the greatly reduced methane production from successive C–C hydrogenolysis. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","Bimetallic catalyst; C–C hydrogenolysis; Deoxygenation; Hydrodeoxygenation; Hydrogenation; m-Cresol; Ni–Re/SiO2","Catalysts; Chemical reactions; Density functional theory; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; Hydrogenation; Hydrogenolysis; Hydrolysis; Infrared spectroscopy; Mesoporous materials; Methane; Nickel; Reduction; Toluene; Transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; Bimetallic catalysts; Deoxygenations; Hydrodeoxygenation; Hydrogenolysis reactions; Intrinsic reaction rate; m-Cresol; Methane production; Temperature-programmed reduction; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016275149

The present work measured and compared the physical and chemical properties of Bakken crudes with conventional crude oils from various regions and different types of refined petroleum products. The physicochemical properties of Bakken crude are overall similar to those of conventional light crudes. The Bakken crude consists of high concentrations of monoaromatic hydrocarbons and alkylated PAHs with a clear dominance of the alkylated naphthalene homologues followed by the phenanthrene series. Its pyrogenic index (PI) values are considerably lower than typical conventional crude oils. The Bakken crude oils in this study exhibit a low abundance of petroleum biomarker such as terpanes, steranes and diamondoids and bicyclic sesquiterpanes. Since tight oil from the Bakken region is produced from low-permeability formations, variations in abundance and diagnostic ratios of common target petroleum hydrocarbons were found among these oils. © 2017","Bakken; Biomarkers; Fingerprinting; PAHs; Tight oil; Unconventional crude","Biomarkers; Hydrocarbons; Naphthalene; Petroleum chemistry; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Bakken; Fingerprinting; Monoaromatic hydrocarbon; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Physical and chemical properties; Physicochemical property; Tight oil; Unconventional crude; Crude oil; alkane; aromatic hydrocarbon; biological marker; diamondoid; monoaromatic hydrocarbon; naphthalene derivative; petroleum; phenanthrene; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; prednisolone; sesquiterpane; terpene; unclassified drug; petroleum; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; biomarker; concentration (composition); crude oil; naphthalene; oil spill; PAH; petroleum hydrocarbon; physicochemical property; Article; Canada; chemical analysis; concentration (parameters); permeability; physical chemistry; quantitative analysis; United States; analysis; chemistry; mass fragmentography; oil spill; water pollutant; Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry; Petroleum; Petroleum Pollution; Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022336466

However, little information exists regarding its effects on prehypertension, a very common, but understudied cardiovascular indicator. We evaluated data from 24,845 adults (ages 18–74 years) living in three Northeastern Chinese cities in 2009. Blood pressure (BP) was measured by trained observers using a standardized mercuric-column sphygmomanometer. Three-year (from 2006 to 2008) average concentrations of particles with an aerodynamic diameter ≤10 μm (PM10), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen dioxides (NO2), and ozone (O3) were calculated using data from monitoring stations. Effects were analyzed using generalized additive models and two-level regression analyses, controlling for covariates. We found positive associations of all pollutants with prehypertension (e.g. odds ratio (OR) was 1.17 (95% confidence interval (CI), 1.09–1.25) per interquartile range (IQR) of PM10) in a fully adjusted model, as compared to normotensive participants. These associations were stronger than associations with hypertension (e.g. OR was 1.03 (95% CI, 1.00, 1.07) per IQR of PM10). We have also found positive associations of all studied pollutants with systolic and diastolic BP: e.g., associations with PM10 per IQR were 1.24 mmHg (95% CI, 1.03–1.45) for systolic BP and 0.47 mmHg (95% CI, 0.33–0.61) for diastolic BP. Further, we observed that associations with BP were stronger in women and in older participants (systolic BP only). In conclusion, long-term exposure to ambient air pollution was more strongly associated with prehypertension than with hypertension, especially among females and the elderly. Thus, interventions to reduce air pollution are of great significance for preventing future cardiovascular events, particularly among individuals with prehypertension. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Blood pressure; Chinese; Prehypertension","Blood pressure; Nitrogen compounds; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Regression analysis; Statistical tests; Sulfur dioxide; Aerodynamic diameters; Ambient air pollution; Average concentration; Cardiovascular event; Chinese; Generalized additive model; Inter quartile ranges; Prehypertension; Air pollution; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; health risk; hypertension; pollution control; pollution exposure; public health; adult; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; ambient air; Article; blood pressure measurement; China; Chinese; diastolic blood pressure; disease association; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; female; human; long term exposure; major clinical study; male; mercury sphygmomanometer; particle size; prehypertension; systolic blood pressure; air pollution; analysis; Asian continental ancestry group; blood pressure; city; environmental exposure; hypertension; middle aged; odds ratio; particulate matter; prehypertension; public health; regression analysis; statistics and numerical data; China; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Asian Continental Ancestry Group; Blood Pressure; China; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Hypertension; Male; Middle Aged; Nitrogen Dioxide; Odds Ratio; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Prehypertension; Public Health; Regression Analysis; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023626108

This will help to promptly obtain information about the quality of the products and will further facilitate composting in taking a significant role in diverting bio-waste from landfills and reduce greenhouse gas emissions (CH4). Nitrogen in the tested samples is mainly contained in the form of insoluble organic nitrogenous substances. To apply the spectrophotometric method for analysis it is necessary for them to be in water-soluble form. For this purpose, the source samples are previously subjected to oxidation with H2O2 in sulphuric acid medium, where the organic carbon is converted to CO2 and the organic nitrogen turns into a water-soluble form. For the spectrophotometric analysis the soluble form of the nitrogen is required to be free NH3. The results from the research give reason to draw the following conclusions: (i) the optimum conditions for the conversion of insoluble organically bound nitrogen to a water soluble form (free NH3) have been determined; (ii) as a consequence the methodological error which was due to incomplete course of the analytical reaction has been corrected.","Nitrogen; Oxidation; Spectrophotometry; Waste",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018437973

Some cases taking conventional hyperbaric oxygen (HBO) therapy or steroid-pulse therapy may be insufficient, and AchEI may be effective. Patient Concerns and Diagnoses: We report two cases of delayed encephalopathy after acute CO poisoning involving two women aged 69 (Case 1) and 60 years (Case 2) whose cognitive function improved with acetylcholinesterase inhibitor (AchEI) treatment. Delayed encephalopathy occurred 25 and 35 days after acute CO poisoning in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively. Both patients demonstrated cognitive impairment, apathy, and hypokinesia on admission. Interventions and Outcomes: Although hyperbaric oxygen therapy did not yield any significant improvements, cognitive dysfunction improved substantially. This was evidenced by an improved Mini-Mental State Examination score ffom 9 to 28 points in Case 1 and an improved Hasegawa's dementia rating scale score from 4 to 25 points in Case 2 after administration of an AchEI. In Case 1, we administered galantamine hydrobromide, which was related with improved white matter lesions initially detected on brain magnetic resonance imaging. However, in Case 2 white matter lesions persisted despite AchEI treatment. AchEI treatment may result in improved cognitive and frontal lobe function by increasing low acetylcholine concentrations in the hippocampus and frontal lobe caused by decreased nicotinic acetylcholine receptor levels in delayed encephalopathy after CO poisoning. Conclusion: Physicians should consider AchEIs for patients demonstrating delayed encephalopathy due to CO poisoning. © 2017 the Author(s).

But the convergence hypothesis for the 19 OECD economies during the period of 1960–2012 can not be rejected.

The concentration of VOCs was higher in the autumn (HB, 96.87 μg/m3; XB, 58.94 μg/m3) than in the spring (HB, 41.49 μg/m3; XB, 43.46 μg/m3), as lower wind speed in the autumn could lead to pollutant accumulation, especially at HB, which is a new urban area surrounded by residential areas and a transportation hub. Alkanes were the dominant group at both HB and XB in both sampling periods, but the contribution of aromatic pollutants at HB in the autumn was much higher than that of the other alkanes (11.16–19.55%). Compared to other cities, BTEX pollution in Shuozhou was among the lowest levels in the world. Because of the high levels of aromatic pollutants, the ozone formation potential increased significantly at HB in the autumn. Using the ratio analyses to identify the age of the air masses and analyze the sources, the results showed that the atmospheric VOCs at XB were strongly influenced by the remote sources of coal combustion, while at HB in the spring and autumn were affected by the remote sources of coal combustion and local sources of vehicle emission, respectively. Source analysis conducted using the Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model at Shuozhou showed that coal combustion and vehicle emissions made the two largest contributions (29.98% and 21.25%, respectively) to atmospheric VOCs. With further economic restructuring, the influence of vehicle emissions on the air quality should become more significant, indicating that controlling vehicle emissions is key to reducing the air pollution. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","BTEX; Ozone formation potential; Sources analysis; Thermal power generation; Volatile organic compounds","Air quality; Aromatic compounds; Coal; Factorization; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas chromatography; Ionization of gases; Ozone; Paraffins; Quality control; Thermoelectric power plants; Urban transportation; Vehicles; Volatile organic compounds; Wind; BTEX; Controlling vehicles; Economic restructuring; Mass selective detection; Ozone formation potentials; Positive matrix factorization models; Thermal power generation; Thermal power stations; Coal combustion; alkane; ozone; volatile organic compound; air pollutant; alkane; coal; exhaust gas; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric pollution; BTEX; concentration (composition); ozone; power generation; power plant; volatile organic compound; air quality; Article; China; coal combustion; combustion; electric power plant; exhaust gas; flame ionization detection; gas chromatography; residential area; seasonal variation; urban area; wind; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; chemistry; city; environmental monitoring; heat; season; synthesis; China; Shanxi; Shuozhou; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Alkanes; China; Cities; Coal; Environmental Monitoring; Hot Temperature; Ozone; Power Plants; Seasons; Vehicle Emissions; Volatile Organic Compounds; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010527212

Sectoral production activities promote economic development while also adding considerably to national CO2 emissions. Due to their different sectoral structures, each region shows different levels of economic development and CO2 emissions. The Chinese government hopes to achieve the dual objectives of economic growth and CO2 emissions reduction by encouraging those sectors that have high economic influence and low environmental influence. Based on the above background, this study constructed an inter-regional sectoral economic influence coefficient (REIC) and a CO2 emissions influence coefficient (RCIC) based on the basic multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model to analyse the economy-carbon nexus of 17 sectors in 30 regions in China in 2010. The results showed that most Chinese sectors and regions had low CO2 emissions influences in 2010. However, some sectors showed negative environmental influences. Specifically, the mining-related sectors showed high CO2 emissions influence with low economic influence. It is encouraging that some light industry and high-end equipment manufacturing sectors had low CO2 emissions influence with high economic influence. For regions, geographic location and past preferential policies are the most important factors influencing local economic growth and CO2 emissions reduction. Most inland regions have low economic influence with high or low CO2 emissions influence. Meanwhile, most coastal regions showed high economic influence with low CO2 emissions influence. Finally, we propose some policy implications for sectors and regions. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","China; CO2 emission; Economic growth; Multi-regional input-output","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Emission control; Public policy; Regional planning; China; CO2 emissions; Economic growths; Environmental influences; Equipment manufacturing; Influence coefficient; Input-output; Preferential policies; Economic and social effects",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035013134

All of the measures to prevent global warming in Japan were first investigated to extract nine measures to reduce CO2 emissions and then classified into the three groups. Secondly, using the GIS functions for database creation and information analysis, a digital map databases reflecting the real situation of automobile traffic in the study area was created. Using this database, the reduction of CO2 emissions was calculated before and after the implementation of the above nine measures (2005 and 2011) in each road unit. Furthermore, in order to evaluate these measures, the situation of the reduction of CO2 emissions was visualized in each road unit on the digital maps using GIS, and the CO2 emissions before and after the implementation effects of the above nine measures were grasped by t-tests using R language. Based on the evaluation results, it was clear that CO2 emissions are the highest on the main roads in the city center, while the roads with a high reduction of CO2 emissions differed according to each measure. It was also found that all the above nine measures were effective, except for the promotion of eco-drive for small-size automobile. This is because, in the case of small-size automobiles, the diffusion rate of eco-drive did not increase greatly, the reduction effect of CO2 emission was small, and the reduction of CO2 emissions by fuel consumption was low. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Automobile traffic; Carbon dioxide reduction; Japan; Spatial analysis; Statistical analysis",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037608940

Recently, the gasoline direct injection (GDI) vehicles have been gaining market share globally due to better fuel efficiency, especially in the European countries. A drawback associated with GDI engines is considerably higher PM emissions compared with PFI engines. The soot in gasoline exhaust gas would contribute to urban air pollution, which is deeply related with adverse health effects. For the reduction of PM emission in Europe, a new regulation known as EURO VI has been set recently. Then, we need to trap soot particles in exhaust gas from gasoline automobiles as well as diesel automobiles. However, the gasoline soot would be much smaller than the diesel soot. Also, the gasoline exhaust gas temperature is much higher. Then, we need gasoline particulate filter (GPF) which needs to have better thermal durability. In this study, as a potential GPF, an SiC fiber filter was numerically examined. The effect of the fiber diameter on the filtration was revealed. Results show that, when the filter of the larger fiber diameter is placed more upstream, the deposition of soot particles widely occurs inside the filter, resulting in the lower pressure drop. © 2017 Trans Tech Publications.","Filtration; Gasoline particulate; Nanoparticles; Numerical simulation; SiC fiber","Air filters; Air pollution; Automobiles; Competition; Computer simulation; Diesel engines; Direct injection; Dust; Fibers; Filtration; Gases; Nanoparticles; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Silicon carbide; Silicon compounds; Soot; Adverse health effects; European Countries; Gasoline direct injection; Particulate filters; Particulate matter emissions; Port fuel injection engines; SiC fibers; Urban air pollution; Gasoline",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019675006

In order to fulfill the financial dimension of this urban regeneration attempt, the Ministry of Environment and Urbanization has developed a planning standard called “Sustainably Performed Urban Regeneration” SuPerUrban to mobilize the economies of sustainable living styles. Compared with the classical urban planning approaches, the environment friendly planning and urban design standard has focused on reducing the carbon footprint of the redevelopment and to create a new urban lifestyle in terms of the use of land, energy, water, natural resources and transportation. SuPerUrban reduces living costs of the households and local government expenditures and provide efficiencies that can be measured with the reduced percentage of the overall carbon footprint. Eventually, while being urban friendly it provides the means for the households to finance their share of the cost of regeneration with their reduced daily expenditures.

In general, both WRF/Chem RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 simulations predict similar increases on average (∼2 °C) for 2-m temperature (T2) but different spatial distributions of the projected changes in T2, 2-m relative humidity, 10-m wind speed, precipitation, and planetary boundary layer height, due to differences in the spatial distributions of projected emissions, and their feedbacks into climate. Future O3mixing ratios will decrease for most parts of the U.S. under the RCP4.5 scenario but increase for all areas under the RCP8.5 scenario due to higher projected temperature, greenhouse gas concentrations and biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOC) emissions, higher O3values for boundary conditions, and disbenefit of NOxreduction and decreased NO titration over VOC-limited O3chemistry regions. Future PM2.5concentrations will decrease for both RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios with different trends in projected concentrations of individual PM species. Total cloud amounts decrease under both scenarios in the future due to decreases in PM and cloud droplet number concentration thus increased radiation. Those results illustrate the impacts of carbon policies with different degrees of emission reductions on future climate and air quality. The WRF/Chem and WRF simulations show different spatial patterns for projected changes in T2 for future decade, indicating different impacts of prognostic and prescribed gas/aerosol concentrations, respectively, on climate change. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality-climate interactions; Continental U.S.; Future air quality; The representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios; Trend analysis; WRF/Chem","Air quality; Atmospheric composition; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Climate models; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Quality control; Spatial distribution; Volatile organic compounds; Wind; Biogenic volatile organic compounds; Cloud droplet number concentrations; Continental U.S; Forecasting modeling; Planetary boundary layers; The representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios; Trend analysis; WRF/Chem; Climate change; carbon; chemical compound; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric modeling; boundary layer; climate feedback; climate modeling; concentration (composition); decadal variation; future prospect; nitrous oxide; ozone; regional pattern; scenario analysis; trend analysis; volatile organic compound; weather forecasting; air quality; Article; boundary layer; climate; climate change; controlled study; gas; greenhouse gas; humidity; North America; particulate matter; precipitation; priority journal; simulation; temperature; titrimetry; wind; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009280992

The objective of this study was to assess the ability of artificial neural networks (ANN) for yield prediction of wheat, barley and maize to determine the most important soil properties for land production potential in Varamin region, Iran. In this study, potential production was calculated using the AEZ model. ANN model inputs were soil characteristics, including the percentage of calcium carbonate, coarse fragments, gypsum, clay, silt and sand, electrical conductivity, sodium absorption ratio and pH. ANN model output was production potential. Mean absolute error, root means square error and coefficient of determination criteria were used to evaluate the performance of the ANN. The obtained results showed that the ANN models with two hidden layers provided the most accurate prediction of production potential. Mean land production potentials for wheat, barley and maize, using ANN models were predicted respectively, as 7417.73, 6810.41 and 8922.48 kg/ha. Sensitivity analysis of models showed that wheat production potential has the most dependence on sodium absorption ratio and clay percent. Sand and coarse fragments rates were the most important parameters for predicting the barley production potential. The sodium absorption ratio and electrical conductivity were determined as the relevant and effective soil properties on maize production potential.

To reduce PM10 emissions in India, it is essential to have models that accurately estimate and predict PM10 concentrations for reporting and monitoring purposes. In this paper Exponential Smoothing Technique and Autoregressive (AR) models are developed to forecast 1-month ahead value of PM10 for Allahabad city which is novelty of this study. AR (1) and AR (5) models are developed using Burge and Yule Walker methods. The mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for Burge method in AR (1) and AR (5) are 14.23% and 10.20%. The MAPE for Yule Walker method in AR (1) and AR (5) are 32.72% and 31.13%. The MAPE in Exponential Smoothing Technique is 5.81% which shows it forecasts better than AR model based on Burge and Yule Walker methods. It is found that Burge Method in AR (5) has less MAPE than Yule Walker Method. Therefore Exponential Smoothing Technique can be used to forecast PM10 for cities in India, showing it is beneficial for giving prior information for human health.","AR models; exponential smoothing; forecasting; PM10",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048000740

The EDS spectra of Tb3+, Bi3+co-doped Y2O3phosphor show the presence of Y, O, Tb and Bi elements. The Tb3+doped Y2O3phosphor emits intense green emission centered at 542 nm due to5D4→7F5transition along with other weak bands on excitation with 266 nm. The emission intensity is found to be optimum at 1 mol% concentration of Tb3+ions. The sample annealed at higher temperature gives larger emission intensity due to reduction in the optical quenching centers. The presence of Bi3+ions in the Tb3+doped phosphor further enhances the emission intensity of Tb3+up to two times. The enhancement in the emission intensity is due to energy transfer from Bi3+to Tb3+ions, which has been confirmed by lifetime measurements.

The annual mean concentrations of PM2.5 PM10 and CO were 42 ± 17 μg m−3, 114 ± 31 μg m−3 and 343 ± 136 ppbv, respectively. Concentrations of both particulate and CO showed high values during winter/pre-monsoon (dry) period and lowest in the monsoon season (wet). Local anthropogenic emission and long-range transport from open biomass burning sources along with favourable synoptic meteorology led to elevated levels of pollutants in the dry season. However, higher values of PM10/PM2.5 ratio during pre-monsoon season were caused by the episodes of dust storm. In the monsoon season, flow of cleaner air, rainfall and negligible emissions from biomass burning resulted in the lowest levels of pollutants. The concentrations of PM2.5, PM10 and CO showed highest values during morning and evening rush hours, while lowest in the afternoon hours. In winter season, reductions of PM2.5 CO and PM10 during weekends were highest of 15%, 13% and 9%, respectively. In each season, the highest PM2.5/PM10 ratio coincided with the highest concentrations of pollutants (CO and NOX) indicating predominant emissions from anthropogenic sources. Exceptionally high concentrations of PM10 during the episode of dust storm were due to transport from the Arabian Peninsula and Thar Desert. Up to ∼32% enhancements of PM10 were observed during strong dust storms. Relatively low levels of O3 and NOx during the storm periods indicate the role of heterogeneous removal. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass burning; Carbon monoxide; Dust storm; India; Particulate matters","Air cleaners; Air pollution; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Biomass; Carbon monoxide; Dust; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Urban growth; Ambient particulate Matter; Anthropogenic emissions; Anthropogenic sources; Biomass-burning; Continuous measurements; Dust storm; India; Particulate Matter; Storms; carbon monoxide; rain; air pollutant; carbon monoxide; dust; exhaust gas; particulate matter; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; carbon; concentration (composition); dust; particulate matter; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; airflow; ambient air; Article; concentration (parameters); dust; dust storm; exhaust gas; India; meteorology; particulate matter; seasonal variation; urban area; winter; analysis; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; Arabian Peninsula; India; Thar Desert; Air Pollutants; Carbon Monoxide; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; India; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016330122

Carbon dioxide (CO2) makes up 20% of the total GHG emitted from agricultural soil. Therefore, an evaluation of CO2 emissions from agricultural soil is necessary in order to make mitigation strategies for environmental efficiency and economic planning possible. However, quantification of CO2 emissions through experimental methods is constrained due to the large time and labour requirements for analysis. Therefore, a modelling approach is needed to achieve this objective. In this paper, the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC), a process-based model, was modified to predict CO2 emissions for Canada from regional conditions. The modified DNDC model was applied at three experimental sites in the province of Saskatchewan. The results indicate that the simulations of the modified DNDC model are in good agreement with observations. The agricultural management of fertilization and irrigation were evaluated using scenario analysis. The simulated total annual CO2 flux changed on average by ±13% and ±1% following a ±50% variance of the total amount of N applied by fertilising and the total amount of water through irrigation applications, respectively. Therefore, careful management of irrigation and applications of fertiliser can help to reduce CO2 emissions from the agricultural sector. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural management; Carbon dioxide emissions; DNDC model; Environmental modelling","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Global warming; Irrigation; Soils; Agricultural management; Carbon dioxide emissions; Denitrification decompositions (DNDC); DNDC models; Environmental efficiency; Environmental modelling; Global climate changes; Process-based modeling; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; fertilizer; water; agricultural management; agricultural soil; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition; denitrification; environmental modeling; soil pollution; agricultural soil; Article; Canada; carbon dioxide transport; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; decomposition; denitrification; environmental planning; greenhouse gas; irrigation (agriculture); prediction; seasonal variation; soil; soil moisture; agriculture; air pollutant; analysis; chemical model; chemistry; denitrification; greenhouse effect; Saskatchewan; soil; statistics and numerical data; Canada; Saskatchewan; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Denitrification; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Chemical; Saskatchewan; Soil; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026267322

Many previous papers have highlighted the implications of different effort-sharing principles and schemes in determining national contributions to global mitigations. In this paper, China's energy transformation towards the 2 °C goal until 2100 is examined in an integrated-assessment model in light of different effort-sharing principles to understand how the application of such schemes may alter China's energy system transformation on a pathway to this long-term goal.

Fossil energy with carbon capture and storage technologies and non-fossil energy will dominate power generation in China over the long run. Coal will be phased out in end-use sectors and electricity use will expand regardless of the effort-sharing principles.

This paper compares an ecological modernisation (EM) development path with a degrowth development path, using urban and land-use planning impact on housing and transportation as cases. The two positions (EM and degrowth) agree on the need for a fundamental reduction in climate gases but disagree on which strategies should be pursued. EM transitions do not challenge the values associated with the capitalistic market economy and believe that policies, such as the right-price signals, should nudge producers and consumers in an environmentally benign direction. Conversely, degrowth rejects the EM belief in green growth, and holds that it will not be possible to decouple the economy from environmental loads to the necessary extent if the economy keeps growing. We conclude that we need a fundamental transformational change in society, i.e., a steering away from the growth ideology, and pursue policies that introduce maximum housing standards and limit mobility to succeed with the goals of the Paris agreement. © 2017 by the authors.","Degrowth; Ecological modernisation; Ecological modernisation; Scenario; Zero-emission society","consumption behavior; ecological modernization; emission control; environmental economics; environmental planning; environmental policy; future prospect; housing; ideology; land use planning; market system; scenario analysis; sustainable development; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011015037

The paper starts with an introduction on the EV Phase 1 test-bedding which was co-led by the LTA and the Energy Market Authority (EMA). The Phase 1 test bed, which started in 2011 and completed in 2013, concluded that EVs are technically feasible in Singapore but their near-term opportunity lies in fleet electrification. Built on the findings from Phase 1, Phase 2 test-bedding, which started in 2014 and co-led by the LTA and the Economic Development Board (EDB), focuses on fleet electrification. This paper details the various pilot projects under Phase 2 including the adoption of a national public charging standard to increase the inter-operability for EV proliferation. A comparison assessment between two prevailing charging standards, namely International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) Type 1 and Type 2, incorporating supporting literature research, is given. Local implementation needs and technical considerations, which have led to the adoption of Type 2 AC and Combo 2 charging systems as the national standard for public charging infrastructure in Singapore, are analysed.

However, huge investments are needed to construct the hydrogen infrastructure to produce, store and distribute hydrogen fuel to fuel cell vehicles. The present study conducted an analysis of a roll-out strategy to introduce fuel cell vehicles and hydrogen stations in Shenzhen, China between 2016 and 2025. An accurate estimation to develop hydrogen economy in Shenzhen in the near-term was provided. Three different scenarios of fuel cell vehicle penetration rate in the new car sales market were employed to predict the number of fuel cell vehicles and daily hydrogen demand in Shenzhen. The capital investment and operation/maintenance cost of on-site steam methane reforming hydrogen fueling stations was estimated. For a station with 100, 500 and 1000 kg/day capacity, the capital investment is $1.04, 4.15 and 7.84 million, respectively, while the corresponding hydrogen fuel price at 20 years of return on investment (ROI) is 7.7, 7.0 and 6.8 $/kg, respectively. A roll-out strategy of ten hydrogen stations in Shenzhen by 2020 was proposed, taking into consideration the population density, average income, locations of grocery stores and shopping malls, and locations of existing gas stations. The total capital investment required to construct 10 hydrogen stations is $19.7 million.

Currently, ICRs plays a crucial role in production. The implementation of energy-efficient manufacturing for ICRs will significantly decrease the energy consumption on the premise of normal production process, and also have remarkable effect on energy-saving and emission-reduction in manufacturing industry. In this context, the energy condition perception and big data analysis of ICRs are the essential procedure to achieve the aforementioned goals. A novel system architecture which mainly focuses on distributed energy condition perception and big data analysis for ICRs is built. Based on the perceptive data of ICRs related to energy consumption, a big data analysis model combined with the manufacturing status of ICRs is proposed, and the relationship between the big data and the analysis model is presented. Through the data analysis model, we can analyze the energy consumption fluctuation characteristic of ICRs operating state, count the energy consumption of the product related to different production phases, predict the health status of ICRs, as well as the trend of energy consumption associated with their operations.

Increasingly frequent wildfires have been an urgent issue for mountain communities. Rocky Mountain landforms trigger lightning, fire, wind, and debris flows. Fire is an important ecological process; however, fire events produce outputs such as the loss of human life and property, air pollution, and postfire debris/mudflows. Keeping people and infrastructure away from fire prone areas and reducing human-caused fires may be an efficient strategy for adapting to climate challenges. This research suggests the establishment of an open-fire ban zone within the wildland-urban interface of the Front Range, where most of Colorado’s population, cultural, and economic centers are located. In remote fire-prone areas, populations should be limited so that large infrequent fires can take their natural course and provide benefits to the ecological process. The research method includes four components: 1) a survey of Colorado wildfires from 2011 to 2016 over 100 acres; 2) a Research Publication Study including fire ecology, postfire debris/mudflows, fire impacts on the environment and humans, as well as climate warming and increasing populations in the Colorado Front Range; 3) field investigations of fire and postfire debris flow sites; and 4) the application of systems thinking, and development of a framework for the prediction models of fire hazards and postfire debris sites. © Wichmann Verlag, VDE VERLAG GMBH · Berlin · Offenbach.","Landforms; Postfire debris flow; Sustainability; Systems thinking; Wildfire; Wildland-urban interface",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102746133

Six typical halls with different orientations, openings, and ceilings but similar spatial scales and materials were selected; their air temperature, relative humidity, air speed, surface temperature, and globe temperature on typical summer and winter days were measured. The results show that the indoor environments are comfortable in summer but too cold in winter. Further analysis shows that the key strategy for comfort in summer is to have high heat capacity to provide shelter from hot air and solar gains; natural ventilation is considered to be merely an auxiliary approach. Climate-responsive design strategies for winter consist of a south-facing orientation with a maximum window-to-wall ratio and significant thermal insulation to utilize solar gains and to provide shelter from cold air. © Copyright 2017 NCEUB.","Ancient timber-frame hall; Climate responsive design; Cold region; Field measurement; Thermal comfort","Fossil fuels; Global warming; Specific heat; Timber; Ventilation; High heat capacity; Indoor environment; Natural ventilation; Responsive designs; Surface temperatures; Thermal environment; Traditional buildings; Window-to-wall ratio; Thermal insulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086315679

The Ni concentration trend, pollution sources, and the potential health risks associated with Ni were investigated. The average Ni concentration was 5.9±5.5 ng m-3, ranging from &lt;0.08 (MDL) to 88.1 ng m-3. The Ni concentrations increased from 2004 to 2008, but then decreased significantly. The obvious decrease of Ni concentration and related health risks confirmed the effectiveness of pollution controls and air quality management policies from the government in China. In order to verify a hypothesis: Ni emission sources have a very strong relationship with the factory work arrangement (work-rest schedule) and the traffic pattern (rush-non rush hours), the comparison of long-term distributions of Ni concentrations were examined between workday and non-workday periods. Both of the high ratio of workdays to non-workdays and the elevated enrichment factors of Ni on workdays can be explained by the fact that the factories reduced their outputs and traffic decreased in the non-workday period. Ni cancer risk was 1.1×10-6 for all ages in both workday and non-workday periods, which was higher than the threshold value of 10-6, demonstrating that carcinogenic Ni was a concern to the residents.

Our results show that with an increase of the metamorphic degree, the number of highly reactive hydroxyl and carboxyl groups show a descending trend whereas the number of low reactivity ether and carbonyl groups increases. The number of carbon-containing groups gradually increases when the metamorphic degree increases, due to a clustering change process which includes an increase in the number of aromatic carbons (Ar-C, H) and a simultaneous decrease in the number of carboxyl carbons (-COOH), methylene carbons (CH2) and ether based carbons (Ar-O, R-O). The reduction rate of carboxyl carbon (-COOH) is closest to the growth rate of aromatic carbon (Ar-C, H). The methyl (CH3) and carboxyl (CO) carbon evolve discontinuously with the metamorphic degree, which is different from the other carbon groups. Linear-regression analysis suggests that the correlation coefficients between aromatic (Ar-C, H), ether (R-O), methylene (CH2) and carboxyl (-COOH) carbons and wettability are 0.98, 0.97, 0.96 and 0.92, respectively, indicating that the main contribution to the wettability from carbon-containing groups comes from these groups. In contrast, hydroxyl oxygen (-OH) has a correlation coefficient as high as 0.98, and is a major contributor from the oxygen-containing groups. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Aromatic compounds; Aromatization; Coal; Ethers; Oxygen; Regression analysis; Wetting; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Carbon containing; Coal wettability; Correlation coefficient; Methylene carbons; Microscopic mechanisms; Oxygen containing groups; Rate of aromatics; Structural variations; Coal dust",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032264935

Considered as a large agricultural country, carbon emission in China's agriculture sector keeps on growing rapidly. It is, therefore, of great importance to investigate the driving forces of carbon dioxide emissions in this sector. The traditional regression estimation can only get “average” and “global” parameter estimates; it excludes the “local” parameter estimates which vary across space in some spatial systems. Geographically weighted regression embeds the latitude and longitude of the sample data into the regression parameters, and uses the local weighted least squares method to estimate the parameters point–by–point. To reveal the nonstationary spatial effects of driving forces, geographically weighted regression model is employed in this paper. The results show that economic growth is positively correlated with emissions, with the impact in the western region being less than that in the central and eastern regions. Urbanization is positively related to emissions but produces opposite effects pattern. Energy intensity is also correlated with emissions, with a decreasing trend from the eastern region to the central and western regions. Therefore, policymakers should take full account of the spatial nonstationarity of driving forces in designing emission reduction policies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide emissions; Geographically weighted regression model; The agriculture sector","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Global warming; Least squares approximations; Parameter estimation; Agriculture sectors; Carbon dioxide emissions; Emission reduction policies; Geographically weighted regression; Geographically weighted regression models; Regression estimation; Spatial non-stationarity; Weighted least squares; Regression analysis; agricultural emission; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; economic growth; least squares method; policy making; regression analysis; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013372010

China is currently the biggest emitter of carbon dioxide in the world, and the iron and steel industry is the largest contributor to China's CO2emissions. Therefore, investigating the main driving forces of the growth in CO2emissions in the iron and steel industry is very necessary and urgent. Interestingly, ignoring the nonlinear relationships between economic variables, most of the existing studies use linear methods to examine the industry's CO2emissions. Based on 30 provincial panel data from 2000 to 2013, this study uses the nonparametric additive regression model to examine the key driving forces of CO2emissions in China's iron and steel industry. The estimation results show that the nonlinear effect of economic growth on CO2emissions is consistent with the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis. Energy efficiency improvement follows an inverted “U–shaped” pattern in relation to CO2emissions because of the difference in R&amp;D funding and R&amp;D personnel investments at different times. An inverted “U–shaped” effect of energy structure is due to the optimization of energy consumption. However, the impact of urbanization exhibits a positive “U–shaped” pattern since fixed asset investment and private car population are much larger at the later stage. Hence, the differential nonlinear effects of these driving forces at different times should be taken into consideration, when discussing reduction of CO2emissions in China's iron and steel industry. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CO2emissions; Nonparametric additive regression models; The iron and steel industry","Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Industrial economics; Investments; Regression analysis; Steelmaking; Urban growth; Additive regression; CO2emissions; Economic variables; Energy efficiency improvements; Environmental Kuznets curves; Estimation results; Fixed asset investments; Non-linear relationships; Iron and steel industry",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009423248

We argue that both market force and institutional constraints prevent financial development from improving the environment in the less developed regions. Hence, the local governments should play a more significant role in the environmental upgrading, for example, actively promoting the local green financing. © 2017 The Authors.","carbon emissions; Financial development; institutional constraints; market force; regional differences","Commerce; Carbon emissions; Financial development; Institutional constraints; Market forces; Regional differences; Finance",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020698944

Open-pit mining, petroleum coke (petcoke) dust, and the transportation of oil sands and waste materials by heavy-duty trucks on unpaved roads could release PM into the air. Incomplete combustion of fossil fuels by engines and stationary boilers leads to the formation of carbonaceous aerosols. In addition, wildfire and biogenic emissions surrounding the oil sands regions also have the potential to contribute primary PM to the ambient air. Secondary organic aerosol formation has been revealed as an important source of PM over nearby and distant areas from the oil sands regions. This review summarizes the primary PM sources and some secondary aerosol formation mechanisms that are linked to oil sands development. It also reviews the approaches that can be applied in aerosol source apportionment. Meteorological condition is an important factor that may influence the primary PM emission and secondary aerosol formation in Alberta's oil sands regions. Current concern should not be limited to the primary emission of atmospheric PM. Secondary formation of aerosols, especially secondary organic aerosol originating from photochemical reaction, should also be taken into consideration. To obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the sources and amount of PM emissions based on the bottom-up emission inventory approach, investigations on how to reduce the uncertainty in determination of real-world PM emission factors for the variable sources are needed. Long-range transport trajectories of fine PM from Alberta's oil sands regions remain unknown. © 2017 Published by NRC Research Press.","Oil sands; Particulate matter; Primary emission; Secondary organic aerosol; Source apportionment","Aerosols; Air quality; Atmospheric composition; Climate change; Fossil fuels; Materials handling; Oil sands; Open pit mining; Petroleum coke; Petroleum transportation; Photochemical reactions; Sand; Solid wastes; Waste incineration; Aerosol source apportionment; Incomplete combustion; Meteorological condition; Particulate Matter; Particulate matter emissions; Primary emissions; Secondary organic aerosols; Source apportionment; Particulate emissions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036471600

It is of great urgency and necessity to obtain a good understanding of the participating sectors of CN-ETS in terms of energy utilization and CO2 emissions. In this regard, it should be noted that the findings may be biased without taking industry heterogeneity into consideration. To this end, a meta-frontier framework with the directional distance function is employed to estimate the CO2 emission performance (CEP), mitigation potential (MP), and marginal abatement cost (MAC) at sector levels under the meta-frontier and the group-frontier. The results indicate that significant disparities in the CEP, MP, and MAC exist under both frontiers among various sectors, and the sectoral distributions of CEP, MP, and MAC are found to be different between the two frontiers. Additionally, the differences between the two frontiers in terms of CEP, MP, and MAC are considerable, and exhibit unequal distributions among these sectors. Notably, MAC under both frontiers and the difference between them are found to be significantly correlated with the carbon intensity. Finally, policy implications are provided for the government and participating enterprises, respectively. © 2017 by the authors.","China's nationwide emission trading scheme; CO2 emission performance; Directional distance function; Marginal abatement cost; Meta-frontier analysis; Mitigation potential","abatement cost; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cost analysis; emission control; emissions trading; state role; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020240206

In this study, we concentrate in service sector and estimates CO2 emission from six sub-sectors: office building, retail and store, hotel and restaurant, education, health care and others. Considering the gap of tertiary industry development and climate diversity across regions, we base our study on regional analysis and the study subject includes 31 provincial regions of mainland China. We first use a bottom-up cost optimization model called AIM/Enduse to evaluate the CO2 reduction potential brought about by efficient technologies in China's service buildings. Then we design mitigation scenarios to examine the achievability of China's INDC as well as the efforts of service sector in achieving the CO2 reduction target stated in China's INDC. The results show that the service sector has a certain potential to succeed a no-regrets CO2 reduction target by 2030. For achieving China's INDC target, all six sub-sectors need implement more efficient technologies.

In general, the more highly industrialized cities had higher PM2.5 concentrations. The lowest three-year average concentrations of PM2.5 occurred at Lhasa and Qiqihar, and were 25.2 and 36.7 µg m–3, respectively, while the highest concentrations of PM2.5 occurred at Baoding and Shijiazhuang, and were 106 and 102 µg m–3, respectively. From 2015 to 2016, the PM2.5 concentrations of most cities decreased, but those of several others (Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, Yinchuan, Lhasa, Sinning, Urumqi, Weinan and Xian) increased, suggesting that the air quality of these was still not well controlled. The average of RM values of the 22 cities were 7.2, 6.5, and 6.1 in 2014, 2015 and 2016, respectively, which means the PM2.5 concentrations in northern China were much higher than the WHO air quality regulated standard (10 µg m–3). A city with a higher PM2.5 concentration always had a higher PM2.5/PM10 ratio. Among the 22 cities, the six highest three-year averages of total-PCDD/Fs-WHO2005-TEQ concentrations were 0.107, 0.102, 0.095,0.092,0.085 and 0.077 pg-WHO2005-TEQ m–3 in Shijiazhuang, Baoding, Zhengzhou, Jinan, Linyi and Xian, respectively; the six lowest three-year averages of total-PCDD/Fs-WHO2005-TEQ concentrations were 0.036, 0.037, 0.045, 0.055, 0.056 and 0.060 pg-WHO2005-TEQ m–3 in Qiqihar, Lhasa, Dalian, Harbin, Changchun and Hohhot, respectively. The PM2.5-bound total PCDD/Fs-WHO2005-TEQ content of 12 cities (six cities with higher PM2.5 concentration and six with lower PM2.5 concentration), during 2014, ranged between 0.444 and 1.000 ng-WHO2005-TEQ g–1 and averaged 0.672 ng-WHO2005-TEQ g–1. The PM2.5 concentrations, RM values and PCDD/Fs-WHO2005-TEQ concentrations in the cities of northern China are higher than those in the south, indicating that the air quality in the north is worse than in the south.

In spite of its potential, this technology needs further research and development to improve its versatility in using liquid fuels as a source of energy. In this review, progress toward the application of the flameless technique was presented with an emphasis on gas turbines. A systematic analysis of the state-of-the-art flameless combustion and the major technical and physical challenges in operating gas turbines with liquid fuels in a flameless combustion mode was presented.

The method is an integration of inexact multistage stochastic programming and a risk management tools from modern financial theory, and could tackle uncertainties described as interval values and probability distributions. The method could reflect energy system dynamic characteristic in a multi-period problem, and provide an effective linkage between conflicting economic cost and the system stability.

We find that the main direction of supply-side carbon emission transfer is from resource-intensive provinces in the central and western regions to developed provinces in the eastern coastal regions. Further analysis shows that the transfer is mainly concentrated in the production and distribution of electricity and heat, nonmetallic mineral products, and basic metals, whose carbon emissions account for approximately 70% of all sectors’ carbon emissions. The differences between the supply side and the demand side of China's provinces are mainly reflected in the transfer out of carbon emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Enabled carbon emissions; Input-output analysis; Interregional Ghosh model; Supply-side perspective","Energy policy; Carbon emissions; Carbon transfer; Input output analysis; Input output model; Input-output table; Nonmetallic minerals; Regional economy; Supply sides; Regional planning; carbon emission; environmental economics; input-output analysis; numerical model; regional economy; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017466610

While promoting economic development, the development and construction of transportation infrastructure has contributed to urban carbon emissions. Using an improved STIRPAT model, we examine panel data for 283 cities between 2003 and 2013 to explore the effects of transportation infrastructure on urban carbon emissions. The results show that transportation infrastructure increases urban carbon emissions and intensity. In addition, while the population scale effect of transportation infrastructure is conducive to decreasing carbon emissions, the economic growth and technological innovation effects of transportation infrastructure increase carbon emissions. Results also demonstrate that in large and medium-scale cities, construction of transportation infrastructure increases carbon emissions. In small cities, this relationship is not significant. Robustness tests support all findings. These results indicate that the effective development of carbon-abatement policies requires an examination of the effects of transportation infrastructure. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Chinese cities; STIRPAT model; Transportation infrastructure","Carbon; Economics; Emission control; Global warming; Population statistics; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; Chinese cities; Economic development; Stirpat models; Structural transformation; Technological innovation; Transportation infrastructures; Urban transportation; abatement cost; carbon emission; economic development; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; environmental policy; growth rate; innovation; numerical model; scale effect; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011920501

Five system properties of congestion pricing (fees, reduced delays, reduced pollution emissions, revenue distribution, charged object) were selected to design survey questionnaire. And the OP model and the MNL model were developed to quantify the impacts of each system properties on the public acceptability and the effectiveness. Using 486 sample data collected from SP survey, the two models of public acceptability and effectiveness were calibrated. It was found that the system properties influenced public acceptability greatly, especially for fees, reduced delay and revenue distribution. However, the effectiveness was relatively less influenced by the system properties as compared to the public acceptability. Moreover, public acceptability and effectiveness of three pricing scenarios in the case of charging different fees were predicted by the two models. It was found that, at the aggregate level, highly effective schemes were less acceptable and highly acceptable schemes were less effective. However, all charging schemes in this research were found to be effective, and one of the effective charging schemes was still acceptable. It indicated that some of the effective schemes can also be accepted, and the design of congestion pricing should pay more attention to public acceptability of it. © 2017 Aussino Academic Publishing House.

Applying wind power and solar power to farm irrigation can contribute to energy saving and carbon emission reduction. Based on the irrigational water demand of cassava in an area in Guangxi Province, China, this study compared the supply capacity of hybrid wind/solar power water pumping and that of photovoltaic (PV) water pumping through experiments and calculation. Results show that, the hybrid pumping system supported by a 22kW solar panel and wind turbines of 44kW can fully satisfy cassava's water demand for irrigation in a 26.66 ha field with surplus energy, so shutdown of wind turbines in the initial stages of cassava growth is suggested. The 22kW photovoltaic water pump alone is not sufficient for a 26.66 ha field, but a 1.5-time larger solar panel (33kW) with an enhanced pump should be able to meet the demand. Considering local uneven distribution of wind power and relative high cost of a hybrid power system, the enhanced photovoltaic water pumping is recommended for popularization. © 2017 The Authors.

In this study, an interregional input-output model is proposed to derive cost curves for regional marginal abatement and to estimate interregional embodied emissions. An emissions trading model is presented for exploring the impacts of emissions accounting methods on imperfect competitive trading markets in the context of China achieving its 12th FYP intensity reduction target. The results indicated that emissions permits could be reallocated according to the CBA method. This could reduce both carbon emissions and total cost. Compared to the PBA method, the CBA method could lead to a greater change in permit prices and the amount of carbon trading in an imperfect competitive carbon market. Moreover, more regions with market power could cause declines in permit prices, resulting in changes in abatement costs. In addition, seven pilot markets (excluding Hubei province) are net embodied emissions importers. Pilot trading schemes in China could lead to carbon leakage among the other non-trading regions and sectors. © 2016","Carbon-trading market; Emissions accounting method; Imperfect competitive; Input-output analysis","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Accounting methods; Carbon trading; Chinese Government; Competitive trading; Embodied emissions; Imperfect competitive; Input output analysis; Intensity reduction; Emission control; abatement cost; analytical method; carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; environmental planning; input-output analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007003037

One potential technical approach is the utilization of a gasoline particulate filter (GPF). The successful adoption of this emission control technology needs to take many aspects into consideration and requires a system approach for optimization. This study conducted research to investigate the impact of vehicle driving cycles, fuel properties and catalyst coating on the performance of GPF. It was found that driving cycle has significant impact on particulate emission. Fuel quality still plays a role in particulate emissions, and can affect the GPF performance.

It is also known that VSCR is active for hydrocarbon (HC) oxidation. However, HC species from diesel engine exhaust may be adsorbed onto VSCR at low exhaust temperatures such as under low engine load or idle conditions. The adsorbed HC may be gradually transformed into more stable coke during engine operation. The accumulated HC or coke on VSCR can result in decreased NOx conversion efficiency due to blockage of catalyst pores and active sites. In addition, rapid oxidation of accumulated HC or coke can lead to exotherms which can thermally damage the VSCR and may lead to vanadium and tungsten release. This work investigates the fundamental adsorption characteristics of HC species on a state-of-the-art VSCR catalyst in the low temperature region.

The extensive investigations and applications of clean energy have been carried out to replace the scattered coal burning and meet the heating demand in Cold region of China. To deal with the air pollution problem, several governmental mitigation measures are strongly enforced, including the replacement of scattered coal by air-source hear pump for space heating in rural areas of China. The collocation of supplementary heat source for the air-source heat pump is more a design issue as well as an economical issue. This paper introduced the calculation method of the most economical balance point temperature (MEBPT) to confirm the collocation of supplementary heat source for air-source heat pump with based on the life cycle cost (LCC) theory and Bin method. The compound system including air-source heat pump and electrical auxiliary heater was analyzed. The proper balance point is much helpful to determine the capacity of the air-source heat pump and the supplementary heat source in the compound system and provide references for the design of space heating system.","air-source heat pump; balance point temperature; LCC; supplementary heat source","Air pollution; Heat pump systems; Heating; Life cycle; Pollution; Pumps; Space heating; Balance point; Collocation method; Electrical auxiliaries; Heating in rural areas; Life cycle costs (LCC); Mitigation measures; Pollution problems; Supplementary heat; Air source heat pumps",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041504403

Keeping CO2 in solution would require terminating the storage operation when the fluid front of injected CO2-saturated brine arrives at the contour of bubble point pressure in the storage reservoir. This complicates the operation and reduces the storage efficiency. To assess whether allowing a free gas phase to form would pose unacceptable risk, we conducted simulations of continuous injection until the injected CO2-saturated brine breaks through at the production well. We quantify the gas saturation profile by combining fractional flow theory and fluid flow model. We use two limiting cases for the mobility of free gas, one assumes exsolved gas remains immobile at all saturations and the other assumes gas flow with the maximum mobility. Both limits yield similar gas saturations formed within the two-phase fluid region, which is small (about 1%) in our case study, thus the risk associated with this small gas saturation is low, regardless of different relative permeability models. The accumulation time has a first-order effect on gas saturation, and it can be reduced by increasing the flow rate or methods that make the location of bubble point pressure close to the extraction well. © 2017 The Authors.","gas saturation; injection rate; mobility; two-phase flow","Bottom hole pressure; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carrier mobility; Dissolution; Flow of fluids; Flow of gases; Gases; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum reservoirs; Risk assessment; Two phase flow; Bubble point pressure; Carbon sequestration; Continuous injections; Fluid flow modeling; Fractional flow theory; Gas saturations; Injection rates; Relative permeability model; Injection (oil wells)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029610882

Previous studies have investigated the overall performance of lab-scale FO-AnMBR in treating synthetic wastewater. Due to enhanced physical rejection of osmosis membrane, salinity gradually increased and emerging contaminants such as cytostatic drugs in wastewater would also be accumulated during operation. The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of increased salinity and the accumulation of cytostatic drugs on the composition and function of the microbial community in FO-AnMBR through a metagenomics approach. We found that salinity increase in FO-AnMBR was the key factor driving compositional and functional transitions in microbial community. At high salinity condition, methane-producing archaea (MPA) became less competitive than sulphate-reducing bacteria (SRB), resulting in a reduced methane yield rate. The reduced methane production could be restored in the next successive cycle and salt-tolerant MPA was continuously enriched in the entire operation. Relative abundance of genes involved in nitrogen metabolism, cell attachment and biofilm related signalling increased from low salinity to high salinity condition, while those for methanogenesis and iron metabolism were found to decrease. The presence of cytostatic drugs caused the inhibition of microbial metabolism and increased extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) concentration. Due to their differential influences on community members, the evenness of community decreased after drug treatment. After the drug treatment, biofilm-forming and siderophore-producing bacteria were found to be more dominant in the microbial community. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Anaerobic treatment; Forward osmosis; Membrane bioreactor; Metagenomic analysis; Microbial community","Bacteria; Bioconversion; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Cell signaling; Drug therapy; Genes; Metabolism; Methane; Sulfur compounds; Anaerobic treatments; Forward osmosis; Membrane bioreactor; Metagenomic analysis; Microbial communities; Wastewater treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020211479

To provide model-ready emission input, the NH3 emission inventory was gridded for the modeling domain at 1 × 1 km resolution using source-based spatial surrogates and a GIS system. The best estimate of total NH3 emission for the province was 228.02 kt in 2015 with a percentage uncertainty of ±16.3%. Four major contributors were farmland ecosystem, livestock wastes, humans and waste treatment, which contributed 39.4%, 43.1%, 4.9%, and 4.2% of the total emissions, respectively. The averaged NH3 emission density for the whole region was 1.88 t km−2 yr−1 and the higher values were found in coastal areas with higher dense populations. The seasonal patterns, with higher emissions in summer, were consistent with the patterns of temperature and planting practices. From 2009 to 2015, annual NH3 emissions increased from 218.49 kt to 228.02 kt. All of these changes are insignificant compared to the estimated overall uncertainties in the analysis, but indicative of changes in the source categories over this period. Between 2009 and 2015, the largest changes occurred in human emissions and waste treatment plants, which were consistent with the process of rapid urbanization. Meanwhile, the decrease of emissions from pigs was slightly higher than the increased emissions from broilers and the increased emissions from meat goats and beef cattle due to the combine effects of increasingly stringent environmental requirements for pig farms and shift away from pork consumption to beef, chicken and mutton. The validity of the estimates was further evaluated using uncertainty analysis, comparison with previous studies, and correlation analysis between emission density and observed ground ammonia. The inventories reflect the changes in economic progress and environmental protection and can provide scientific basis for the establishment of effective PM2.5 control strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ammonia; Ammonia measurement; Emission inventory; Evaluation; Tempo-spatial distribution","Agriculture; Ammonia; Ecosystems; Mammals; Meats; Waste treatment; Ammonia measurements; Correlation analysis; Emission inventories; Environmental requirement; Evaluation; Farmland ecosystem; Rapid urbanizations; Waste treatment plant; Uncertainty analysis; ammonia; water; ammonia; cattle; emission inventory; GIS; goat; particle size; particulate matter; pig; pollutant source; pollution monitoring; spatial distribution; spatial resolution; surrogate method; temporal distribution; uncertainty analysis; urbanization; valuation; agricultural land; air pollution; Article; beef; beef cattle; broiler; chicken; China; density; ecosystem; environmental temperature; goat; human; livestock; meat; model; mutton; nonhuman; pig; pork; priority journal; seashore; summer; urbanization; waste management; waste water treatment plant; China; Fujian; Bos; Capra hircus; Suidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019929919

The results show that CO2 emissions intensity tends to diverge during the sample period of 1995-2014. However, convergence clubs are found in the ergodic distributions of the full sample and two sub-sample periods. Divergence, polarization, and stratification are the dominant characteristics in the distribution dynamics. Weightings with economic and population sizes have important impacts on current distributions and hence long-run steady distributions. Neglecting the size of the economy may underestimate the deterioration in the long-run steady state. The result also shows that conditioning on space and income cannot eliminate the multimodality in the long-run distribution. However, capital intensity has an important impact on the formation of convergence clubs. Our findings will contribute to an understanding of the spatial dynamic behaviors of CO2 emissions across Chinese provinces, and have important policy implications for CO2 emissions reduction in China. © 2017 by the authors.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Chinese provinces; Conditional distribution; Distribution dynamics; Weighted kernel estimation","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; estimation method; integrated approach; policy making; pollution monitoring; spatial analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011044744

The results indicated that tree carbon storage at the stand scale was not affected by long-term N addition in the subtropical forest.

A field experiment and a static incubation study in a lab were conducted to stimulate wheat growth and investigate its potential to reduce CO2 emissions from soil through intercropping with a traditional Chinese medicinal herb called Isatis indigotica. This work was conducted by adding I. indigotica root exudates based on the quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) analysis of the DNA copy number of the rhizosphere or bulk soil microbial populations. This addition was performed in relation to the CO2 formation by cellulolytic microorganisms (Penicillium oxalicum, fungi and Ruminococcus albus) to elucidate the microbial ecological basis for the molecular mechanism that decreases CO2 emissions from wheat fields using I. indigotica. The results showed that the panicle weight and full grains per panicle measured through intercropping with I. indigotica (NPKWR) increased by 39% and 28.6%, respectively, compared to that of the CK (NPKW). Intercropping with I. indigotica significantly decreased the CO2 emissions from soil under wheat cultivation. Compared with CK, the total CO2 emission flux during the wheat growth period in the I. indigotica (NPKWR) intercropping treatment decreased by 29.26%. The intensity of CO2 emissions per kg of harvested wheat grain declined from 7.53 kg CO2/kg grain in the NPKW (CK) treatment to 5.55 kg CO2/kg grain in the NPKWR treatment. The qPCR analysis showed that the DNA copy number of the microbial populations of cellulolytic microorganisms (P. oxalicum, fungi and R. albus) in the field rhizosphere around I. indigotica or in the bulk soil under laboratory incubation was significantly lower than that of CK. This finding indicated that root exudates from I. indigotica inhibited the activity and number of cellulolytic microbial populations, which led to decreased CO2 emissions, suggesting this plant's potential role in mitigating agricultural GHGs and in supporting agroecology. © 2017","Cellulolytic microbial population; CO2 reduction; qPCR analysis; Root exudates; Wheat intercropping Isatis indigotica; Winter wheat soil","Cultivation; Fungi; Grain (agricultural product); Greenhouse gases; Microorganisms; Polymerase chain reaction; Soils; CO2 reduction; Microbial populations; qPCR analysis; Root exudates; Wheat intercropping Isatis indigotica; Winter wheat; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; agricultural soil; biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; cellulose; experimental study; herb; inhibition; intercropping; medicinal plant; microbial activity; microbial community; mitigation; polymerase chain reaction; soil carbon; wheat; Article; gene dosage; intercropping; Isatis; Isatis indigotica; nonhuman; Penicillium oxalicum; priority journal; real time polymerase chain reaction; rhizosphere; root exudate; Ruminococcus albus; seasonal variation; soil; soil microflora; winter wheat; Fungi; Isatis tinctoria; Penicillium oxalicum; Ruminococcus albus; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016965038

Among them, electrostatic interactions such as hydrogen bonds play pivotal roles in countless chemical processes and biochemical living systems. By mimicking biocatalysis, various organocatalysts equipped with hydrogen-bond functionality have been developed; however, a challenge has persisted in designing catalysts exploiting other types of noncovalent interactions. Here, we report metal-free hydroboration reactions of carbonyl compounds and CO2 catalyzed by aromatic diazadiborinine. A joint experimental and computational study on the reaction mechanism suggests that adducts of diazadiborinine with carbonyl and CO2 formed at the initial stage of the reactions serve as actual catalysts. The former stabilizes the transition state by using the electrostatic interaction between the hydride of borane and the polar, hole-shaped structure of the adduct. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.","boron; catalysis; CO2 reduction; electrostatic effect; hydroboration; noncovalent interaction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023169067

The experiment was conducted on a six-cylinder diesel engine with common rail fuel injection, two-stage turbocharger and Miller cycle. The results revealed that Miller cycle decreased soot and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions and increased brake thermal efficiency (BTE) in certain operation. In the steady operation, the intake flow was reduced in a cold condition because the low oil temperature led to the hydraulic mechanism delay intake valve closing timing. However, by adjusting VGT, low emissions of soot and NOx could still be obtained with relatively high BTE. In cold transient process, dynamic response of torque depended on indicated work and gas pumping work. A good trade-off performance could be achieved by maintaining the initial VGT rack position for 0.5 s. Compared to VGT variation under the steady-state map, soot peak emissions were reduced by 50% with NOx emissions nearly unchanged by VGT control strategy 3 and Miller cycle. Compared to diesel conventional cycle, the combination of Miller cycle and VGT control strategy 3 can not only ensure quick dynamic torque response, but also reduce NOx peak emissions by 10% with slightly increased soot peak emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Dynamic response; Emission; Miller cycle; Transient condition; Variable geometry turbocharger","Combustion; Dynamic response; Economic and social effects; Engine cylinders; Fuel injection; Geometry; Mechanisms; Neutron emission; Nitrogen oxides; Soot; Superchargers; Turbomachinery; Brake thermal efficiency; Common rail fuel injection; Heavy-duty diesel engine; Intake valve closings; Miller cycle; Steady and transient; Transient conditions; Variable geometry turbocharger; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015068374

Historically, the major benefits have included odor control and the potential to generate income from the energy produced and from tipping fees received for imported organic waste co-digested - these and multiple other significant benefits are provided in Appendix A. Despite the many benefits AD offers, it has not been widely adopted by US dairy farms to date since the cost to own and operate an anaerobic digestion system (ADS) generally exceeded the revenues and direct avoided costs. From the perspective of the value of renewable energy produced, the price paid by the utility for the electricity generated has not fully valued the greenhouse gas (GHG) reductions that an ADS is able to deliver. The valuation of all benefits associated with AD is important to determine, in order to promote public policies that expand opportunities to implement renewable energy in New York State. GHG emission reductions (i.e., the mass of carbon dioxide equivalents [MT CO2 eq.]) associated with AD (in this analysis, an ADS followed by solid-liquid separation with liquid effluent stored long-term) in NYS, were quantified in this paper using the most current quantification protocols available. The reductions quantified include: 1) the replacement of fossil fuel-based electrical energy by using AD produced biogas to fuel an on-site engine-generator set, and 2) the GHG emissions (methane and nitrous oxide) from long-term manure storages required by a farm's Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation (CAFO) permit (for water quality purposes). The difference between the baseline condition (4.96 MT CO2 eq/cow-year) and the conditions post-implementation of an ADS, yields the farm's net GHG emissions associated with the implementation of an ADS (3.32 MT CO2 eq/cow-year). The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)'s ""social cost of carbon"" (SC-CO2) can be used to quantify the economic value of the reduced GHG emissions associated with AD. Using the net GHG reduction value and a threeyear average SC-CO2 of $47.82/MT CO2 eq. (average value used by the NYS Public Service Commission in a zero emission credit from US EPA at 3% discount value and adjusted for inflation over 2017 to 2019) (EPA, 2016), the GHG reduction component of the environmental economic value of farm-based AD (Eghg), expressed on an electrical energy generated basis was calculated to be $0.081/kWh. This value is in addition to the value of the electrons generated. If organic substrates are diverted from a landfill and used as co-digestion substrates, the Eghg would be increased; landfill diversion of organic waste is being discussed in NYS and has already been implemented in some neighboring states.","Anaerobic digestion; Climate change; Dairy; Economics; Greenhouse gases","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Costs; Dairies; Deceleration; Digestive system; Economic analysis; Economics; Effluents; Electric equipment protection; Electric generators; Emission control; Environmental Protection Agency; Fertilizers; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Manures; Nitrogen oxides; Odor control; Produced Water; Public utilities; Wastes; Water quality; Base-line conditions; Concentrated animal feeding operations; Engine generator set; Environmental economics; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Social cost of carbon; Solid liquid separation; US Environmental Protection Agency; Anaerobic digestion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035356739

The paper attempts to evaluate the impact of their construction by comparing socio-economic development indicators and quality of life conditions of residents in two regions. In the area of Belchatow, in which operates the largest lignite mine and the lignite fired power plant (commune Kleszczow) and commune around deposit Gubin-Brody with similar lignite resource potential, as in the Belchatow-Szczercow deposit. Paper analyzes both the historical data of Belchatow area from the period before the construction of the mine and power station Belchatow and contemporary data as well as compare current data from both regions Belchatow and Gubin. Several socio-economic indicators were studied such as: labor market, household income and consumption expenditure, education, healthcare and social welfare, etc. It was shown how the commune Kleszczow developed and gained through the influence of the budget of various fees and taxes related to the conduct of mining activities and energy production. The analysis was conducted in the context of the growing importance of CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) in relation to the wider group of stakeholders. These activities include local communities and environmental issues, including the implementation of the achievements of research on clean coal technologies. The negative image of mining and energy sector has a historical context, as in Poland in the previous era the governments not counted completely with environmental consequences of those industries coal was a source of hard currency, and the electricity was necessary for energy-intensive heavy industry and former regime increased their production without considering the consequences. Currently, highly effective power units meet the highest environmental standards and real threat to residents’ health is low emissions, the composition of which is a consequence of energy poverty of Polish households. Unfortunately, the reduction of low emissions, which could improve the quality of life and health of citizens in reality, is not a subject of EU policy and reduction of limits and supported RES increase energy costs prompts Polish citizens to make use of the cheapest, low quality coal. © SGEM 2017.","Csr; Lignite deposit; Mining; Power plant; Regional development","Budget control; Coal industry; Deposits; Economics; Environmental technology; Fossil fuel power plants; Health risks; Lignite; Mining; Power plants; Quality control; Regional planning; Social aspects; Corporate social responsibilities (CSR); Environmental consequences; Environmental standards; Lignite deposits; Lignite-fired power plants; Regional development; Socio-economic development; Socio-economic indicators; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032354641

A $1/metric ton increase in California's CO2 price is estimated to have increased the electricity prices by $0.41/MWh (p-value &lt; 0.0001) for NP15, $0.59/MWh (p-value &lt; 0.0001) for SP15, $0.41/MWh (p-value = 0.0056) for Mid-C, and $0.15/MWh (p-value = 0.0925) for PV. These estimates reflect: (a) the NP15 and SP15 sellers’ pricing behavior of fully including the CO2 price in their intra-state transactions; (b) the Mid-C price's 100% pass-through of the CO2 price in the Pacific Northwest's hydro export to California; and (c) the statutory obligation of paying the CO2 emissions cost by California's buyers of the electricity imported from the Desert Southwest. The policy implication is that internalization of CO2's externality in the Western U.S.A. requires a cap-and-trade program with a regional scope that encompasses all four hubs, thereby remedying the California program's limited geographic coverage which introduces distortions in neighboring markets. © 2017","California; Cap-and-trade program; CO2 price; Western U.S.A.; Wholesale electricity prices","Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cost estimating; Costs; Economics; Public policy; California; Cap-and-trade program; CO2 price; Western U.S.A; Wholesale electricity; C (programming language); carbon dioxide; carbon emission; electricity; emissions trading; energy market; price dynamics; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026776053

Using the daily market data for a 65-month period of 01/01/2011–05/31/2016, this empirical paper documents that the California Independent System Operator's day-ahead prices have a CO2 premium approximately equal to natural-gas-fired generation's marginal cost of CO2 emissions. This finding prevails in the six time-of-day periods developed to match the pricing periods used by the state's local distribution companies and the bilateral trading of wholesale electricity in the Western Interconnection, a large electricity grid serving the western portion of North America and a Mexican state. Our findings suggest that the California cap-and-trade (C&amp;T) program is effective in internalizing CO2 emission costs of the in-state natural-gas-fired generation. However, the program's economic efficiency is compromised by the unintended consequence of power laundering under inter-regional trading of wholesale electricity. While the program encourages the Pacific Northwest's hydro export that displaces California's natural-gas-fired generation, it also induces output increases by non-California coal- and natural-gas-fired generators in the Western Interconnection. Hence, reducing the overall CO2 emissions in the Western Interconnection requires expanding the program's geographic scope to meaningfully address the global warming problem. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","California; Carbon trading; CO2 emissions cost pass-through; Day-ahead market; Electricity price behavior","C (programming language); Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Costs; Economics; Electric utilities; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; California; Carbon trading; Climate change policies; Day ahead market; Electricity prices; Independent system operators; Unintended consequences; Western interconnections; Electric power system interconnection; abatement cost; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; data set; electricity; electricity generation; emissions trading; energy market; environmental economics; environmental policy; global warming; natural gas; price dynamics; smart grid; California; Pacific Northwest; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025610892

Hence, informal education plays an important role in raising low carbon awareness. Schools in Malaysia organise various green projects but often these best practices were not shared nor recognised. This paper discusses the organising of a sustainable and low carbon schools exhibition. The objective of the exhibition is three-fold. First, from the research point of view, to understand green activities conducted at schools in Iskandar Malaysia; second to give recognition to schools that contributed to sustainable and low carbon Johor and third, to provide a platform for schools to showcase their effort and an opportunity to build network among them. This school exhibition was conducted for two consecutive years (2015 and 2016), inviting all primary and secondary schools to showcase their school effort in promoting sustainable and low carbon practices. For both years, 21 and 23 schools were accepted respectively into the exhibition after sending in their school profiles for preliminary screening. The profiles detailed the activities organised and participated by teachers, students and community around their school area. During the exhibition, each school presented one poster detailing their effort, followed by an oral presentation to a panel of judges. A group interview were conducted after the exhibition among committee members accompanying judges assessing school projects. Drawing data from these three sources (the school profiles, posters and group interview), several main themes of programmes emerged including 3R (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle), Reducing CO2, Indirect Programmes and Low Carbon Education Programme. Some of these activities are able to generate income to sustain the activities themselves or support other school projects.

These capabilities permit the development of a monitoring system for certain forestry purposes such as aboveground biomass (AGB) estimation, where regular updating is essential under the measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) system of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries (REDD+) scheme. The development of high-resolution three-dimensional data sets of digital photogrammetry and airborne laser scanning (ALS) have enhanced the estimation accuracy for height-related forest variables such as AGB. In this chapter, we discuss the elements of the methodology using a combination of remote sensing data sets and ground-based inventory for AGB estimation. Then, we demonstrate the capability of using aerial photographs and ALS data sets in estimating AGB from a case study conducted in the tropical montane forest environment of Northern Borneo, Malaysia. We also discuss the use of other remote sensing data for the same purpose of AGB estimation, including the potential and limitation in the context of the Southeast Asia region. In the case where there is an existing regular flight campaign of aerial photographs acquisition, it is cost-effective way using an aerial photographs data set in updating and monitoring AGB on a national or subnational scale once a detailed ALS-digital terrain model is available. The research implication of this study demonstrates the capability of using high-resolution three-dimensional data sets with a combination of a ground data set to estimate AGB for the MRV system. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Portion of organic wastes were diverted from landfilling by converting it into compost (organic fertiliser) for reducing greenhouse gases (GHG) emission at the landfill and the dependency on inorganic fertiliser. Composting has been reported as a sustainable approach to reduce the footprint of GHG as compared to the waste disposal through landfilling. However, the amount of GHG emitted during composting can vary due to localised condition. The aim of this study was to assess the potential of composting in mitigating GHG emission compared to the current waste management employed in UTM (Landfilling). A business as usual (BAU) scenario represents the current organic waste management practice in UTM was established. Composting was proposed as an alternative scenario. The amount of GHG emitted or reduced from different sources including for transportation, waste processing, waste treatment as well as downstream activities such as carbon sequestration and inorganic fertiliser substitution was estimated based on lifecycle inventory analysis. The result indicated that composting scenario offer a GHG reduction of 66.72 % as compared to the BAU scenario. The fugitive emission from biodegradation of organic waste contributed significantly to the GHG emission for both scenarios whereas the GHG emission from the fossil fuel combustion was considered as not significant. The overall result suggested the potential of composting as a viable technology for sustainable organic waste management in UTM.

The export cessation would necessitate US electric utilities to increase their power generating capacity to make up for the shortfall in imports.

However, each technology is usually assessed separately and not within a consistent macro-economic, multi-sectoral framework. Here we present a multi-regional input-output based hybrid approach with integrated scenarios to facilitate the carbon footprint assessment of all direct and indirect effects of a transition to low-emission transportation and electricity generation technologies in Australia. The work takes into account on-road energy consumption values that are more realistic than official drive-cycle energy consumption figures used in previous work. Accounting for these factors as well as for Australia's grid electricity, which heavily relies on coal power, electric vehicles are found to have a higher carbon footprint than conventional vehicles, whereas hybrid electric vehicles have the lowest. This means that – from a carbon footprint perspective – powertrain electrification is beneficial only to a certain degree at the current stage. This situation can be changed by increasing shares of renewable electricity in the grid. In our best-case scenario, where renewable energy accounts for 96% of the electricity mix in 2050, electric vehicle carbon footprints can be cut by 66% by 2050 relative to 2009. In the business-as-usual scenario (36% renewable electricity share by 2050), electric vehicles can reach a 56% reduction if fossil fuel power plants significantly increase their efficiencies and use carbon capture and storage technologies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicles; Hybrid life cycle assessment; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Multi-sectoral scenario analysis; Real-world fuel consumption; Renewable energy","Carbon capture; Carbon footprint; Electric lighting; Electric power plants; Electric power transmission networks; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy utilization; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Light electric vehicles; Vehicle-to-grid; Input output analysis; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Real-world; Renewable energies; Scenario analysis; Electric power system interconnection; carbon footprint; electric vehicle; electricity generation; electrification; emission control; fossil fuel; fuel consumption; input-output analysis; life cycle analysis; renewable resource; scenario analysis; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028592540

Along California's North Coast streams, private property regimes on land have created commons tragedies in groundwater and salmon fisheries, both classic examples of commons that are often governed collectively and sustainably by their users. Understanding the linkages between salmon and groundwater is one major focus of salmon recovery and climate change adaptation planning in central California and increasingly throughout the Pacific Northwest. In this paper, I use extended field interviews and participant-observation in field ecology campaigns and regulatory forums to explore how, in one water-scarce, salmon-bearing watershed on California's central coast, collaborators are synthesizing agency and landowner data on groundwater and salmon management. I focus on three projects undertaken by citizen scientists in collaboration with me and Gold Ridge Resource Conservation District staff: salmonid censuses, mapping of wet and dry stream reaches and well monitoring. I find that collaborative research initiated by local residents and agency personnel has, in some cases, created a new sense of ecological possibility in the region. I also consider some limitations of this collaborations, namely the lack of engagement with indigenous Pomo and Miwok tribal members, with the Confederated Tribes of Graton Rancheria and with farmworkers and other marginalized residents, and suggest strategies for deepening environmental justice commitments in future collaborative work. © 2017 by the author.

The study was performed on 65 heaps scattered in agricultural land in southern Poland. The sites were described in terms of plant community characteristics, soil physicochemical properties, distance from woodland, altitude and local climate. The number of plant species and proportion of species of the Festuco-Brometea class decreased with increasing heavy metal (Cd, Pb, Zn) content in the soil, and increased with Ca content and pH of the soil. There was a negative relationship between the proportion of the later successional species and heavy metal content in the soil and a positive relationship between plants connected with the earlier stages of succession and metals. Floristic composition was also affected by distance from woodland and height above sea level. The investigated heaps were primarily colonised by native species dispersed by wind, characterised as competitive stresstolerant, ruderal and competitive strategy species. Three types of Carlino acaulis-Brometum erecti (CB) communities were distinguished: CB typicum - dominated by Brachypodium pinnatum, with the highest proportion of calcareous grassland species, CB festucetosum ovinae subass. nova - loose grassland with abundant facultative metallophytes, and the CB rubietosum caesi subass. nova with nutrientdemanding ruderal and woody plants invading from the nearby forest communities. The three subassociations represent different successional stages of Carlino acaulis-Brometum erecti, strongly dependent on both the substrate and spatial relations.

We use hydrologic projections based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) to estimate changes in the frequency of modeled 1% annual exceedance probability (1% AEP, or 100-year) flood events at 57 116 stream reaches across the contiguous United States (CONUS). We link these flood projections to a database of assets within mapped flood hazard zones to model changes in inland flooding damages throughout the CONUS over the remainder of the 21st century. Our model generates early 21st century flood damages that reasonably approximate the range of historical observations and trajectories of future damages that vary substantially depending on the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions pathway. The difference in modeled flood damages between higher and lower emissions pathways approaches USD4 billion per year by 2100 (in undiscounted 2014 dollars), suggesting that aggressive GHG emissions reductions could generate significant monetary benefits over the long term in terms of reduced flood damages. Although the downscaled hydrologic data we used have been applied to flood impacts studies elsewhere, this research expands on earlier work to quantify changes in flood risk by linking future flood exposure to assets and damages on a national scale. Our approach relies on a series of simplifications that could ultimately affect damage estimates (e.g., use of statistical downscaling, reliance on a nationwide hydrologic model, and linking damage estimates only to 1% AEP floods). Although future work is needed to test the sensitivity of our results to these methodological choices, our results indicate that monetary damages from inland flooding could be significantly reduced through substantial GHG mitigation. © 2017 Author(s).",,"climate change; climate effect; emission control; flood damage; flooding; floodplain; greenhouse gas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044072148

The volatiles released are converted in the furnace above the waste bed which has been calculated with FLUENT. A comparison of simulations with measurements in an existing MSW incineration plant of CO2, O2, H2O and temperatures above the bed is presented.

Having experienced natural disasters, e.g. floods and droughts, most of the highly developed countries became more conscious about their impact on the environment. In 2014, the global CO2 emission accompanying fuels combustion and industrial processes totaled to 35.669 billion tonnes, in that 298.131 million tonnes in Poland[15]. The counteracting climate changes in view, in March 2007 the European Parliament assumed an energy-climate package focusing on the reduction of greenhouse gases by 20% to 2020 (as compared to the reference year of 1990). One of the ways of limiting emission is CO2 sequestration (Carbon Capture and Storage). Gases can be stored on land in abandoned deposits of hydrocarbons, salt caverns or deep aquifers. This aim can be achieved by using the already existing wells. The possibilities of using oil wells for CO2 injection and influence of particular safety barriers on the integrity of the well are presented in the paper. The safety barriers have been divided into primary and secondary, depending on the works performed in the well. Bearing in mind the state of the art, new drilling techniques and technologies, the authors suggest using third grade safety barriers, e.g.: system monitoring pressure in the well while drilling, i.e. Managed Pressure Drilling, where the pressure is controlled by a rotary BOP; SOR system monitoring pressure in the well with the use of manometers in the space between columns; complex monitoring system covering the area around the well for hydrocarbons. © 2017, International Multidisciplinary Scientific Geoconference.

The methodology of the inventory of greenhouse gas emissions applied in these documents was evaluated. On the basis of the results of the inventory of greenhouse gases presented in the studied plans, the estimation of carbon footprint was carried out for the individual municipalities, which was expressed in carbon dioxide equivalent. Furthermore, statistical and comparative analyzes were carried out. There were significant differences in the size of the carbon footprint in the individual municipalities and sectors, resulting mainly from the non-uniform methodological assumptions. Global values range from 17.3 thousand Mg CO2eq/year to 436.4 thousand Mg CO2eq/year (with an average of 131.1 thousand Mg CO2eq/year and a standard deviation of 91.6 thousand Mg CO2eq/year), while per capita from 2.9 Mg CO2eq to 31.5 Mg CO2eq (with an average of 6.6 Mg CO2eq and a standard deviation of 4.5 Mg CO2eq). Having compared the size of the carbon footprint in the analyzed municipalities with the calculations carried out for the Starogard county, which is under a pilot program of low carbon development, as well as estimate values for Poland, presented in national and international reports on CO2 emissions, it was found that in most cases, the values are underestimated, which makes it difficult to identify the main sources of emissions and hence the implementation of effective low carbon policy at the local level in Poland. © 2017, Middle Pomeranian Scientific Society of The Environment Protection.

Yet, the biogeochemical implications of the landfill gull phenomenon have been largely ignored. This study has two goals: 1) to understand the magnitude and geographic extent of landfill gulls in North America, and 2) to quantify the amount of carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) transported from landfills to gull roosting sites in order to understand their potential impacts on water quality and methane (CH4) emission. We synthesized and mapped data from the eBird Citizen Science database and found that 1.4 million gulls have been documented at landfills throughout North America, though the actual population is probably greater than 5 million. Using a carnivorous bird transport model we estimate that these gulls transport 39,000 to 139,000 kg of P and 240,000 to 858,000 kg of N y−1 to neighboring water bodies and avoid roughly 1.1 to 3.9 Tg y−1 of landfill CH4 emissions. The avoided CH4 emission mitigation is insignificant in the context of gross landfill emissions, but the transported nutrients may be relevant to water quality management at local and continental scales. For example, at the Jordan Lake reservoir in North Carolina, a flock of 49,000 Ring-billed Gulls (Larus delawarensis) annually deposits landfill feces containing 1070 kg P, an amount equivalent to approximately half of total maximum daily load reduction targets and worth roughly $2.2 million USD in nutrient credits. We estimate that continent-wide gull impacts are worth at least $100 million in nutrient offset credits. We conclude that mega-flocks of landfill gulls are common and widespread, and that their capacity to transport nutrients may be contributing to the eutrophication of aquatic ecosystems and water supplies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Birds; Eutrophication; Landfill; Phosphorus; Reservoir","Aquatic ecosystems; Biogeochemistry; Birds; Carbon; Eutrophication; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Population statistics; Quality management; Reservoirs (water); Water conservation; Water management; Water quality; Water supply; Biogeochemical; Citizen science; Continental scale; Emission mitigation; North Carolina; Potential impacts; Total maximum daily load; Transport modeling; Land fill; carbon; methane; nitrogen; phosphorus; aquatic ecosystem; biogeochemistry; eutrophication; landfill; methane; phosphorus; roosting; seabird; water quality; water supply; aquatic environment; Article; biogeochemistry; bird; data base; eutrophication; feces; lake; landfill; Larus delawarensis; nonhuman; North America; North Carolina; nutrient; nutrient content; overwintering; priority journal; water quality; water supply; animal; Charadriiformes; eutrophication; Jordan; waste disposal facility; Jordan; North America; North Carolina; United States; Aves; Larus delawarensis; Animals; Charadriiformes; Eutrophication; Feces; Jordan; North Carolina; Waste Disposal Facilities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020768953

Not only is legislation forcing manufacturers to meet ever more stringent emissions standards (particularly in terms of CO2), but customers are also demanding more efficient, safer and more electronically advanced vehicles (both in terms of performance features and interfaces). Manufacturers have responded with dramatic improvements in engine and powertrain efficiencies which have helped address legislative requirements to date. Furthermore they have rapidly moved away from standard steel bodies to multi-material solutions including various advanced grades of steel, aluminium, magnesium and polymer-based materials. Indeed there is currently significant research in the field of composite use for automotive bodies where there are pressing questions about manufacturing times for high volume production, costs and recyclability. The rail industry faces similar pressures as those seen in the automotive sector, driven by needs for lower costs, increased capacities, reduced carbon emissions and higher customer expectations.

There is a significant number of large-scale AD facilities operating world-wide, largely treating livestock wastes, and used primarily for electricity production in industrialized countries. At the same time, there are millions of small, household-scale ADs deployed in developing countries, mostly to provide biogas resources for heating and cooking. Decentralized low-volume AD systems could provide a local, renewable energy source (for electricity, heating, or both), reduce or eliminate waste disposal costs, and limit discharges of high strength wastes. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of deploying low-volume anaerobic digestion (LVAD) systems at institutions generating significant food waste, using Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT) as a case study. Mass flows and energy balance, net present value (NPV), and discounted payback period (DPP) were used to assess the feasibility of implementing an anaerobic digestion system utilizing the campus organic waste resources. Our study showed that a positive NPV can be achieved if subsidies and incentives were applied to offset the initial capital investment. However, the economics can be improved by driving down equipment cost and accepting food waste from other establishments to generate revenue from tipping fees.

The current assessment leverages the prior multi-year evaluation assessing the attractiveness ('do-ability') and prize for miscible EOR within each geologic area and reservoir within the field. Two geologic areas, the ""heterogeneous"" and ""homogeneous"" geologic regions of the Crestal area in the largest reservoir were identified as the primary targets for field scale miscible EOR based on the prior multiyear assessment and are the focus of the current assessment. Commercial field-scale miscible development is predicated on a 1-to-1 line drive waterflood with 1km spaced extended reach horizontals with 10,000 ft completions and 500m spaced infills in the more heterogeneous area of the field. Given the offshore environment, base development utilizes four artificial islands which support facilities for field development and serve as drilling centers. Commercial development with miscible EOR will be implemented in a 'phased' (staged) approach where the initial developments will be from the Central Island in the late 2030s followed in succession by the South Island in the early 2040s and North Island in the 2050s. This assessment uses a novel phased approach where a 'Tapered WAG' scheme is used. By utilizing a phased ('staged') approach, multiple development concepts can be evaluated expediently. In this work we (i) show an efficient field assessment process for miscible EOR, (ii) illustrate how subsequent patterns can be brought on-line over time as part of a Tapered WAG process and (iii) demonstrate the importance of commercial assessment as part of field development planning and pilot assessment. The full field assessments included here allows multiple development strategies to be assessed expediently and facilitates the selection of an injection solvent (hydrocarbon gas or CO2). Full field economics have been completed and hydrocarbon gas has been identified as the target solvent. Hydrocarbon gas has the benefit of being commercially attractive and is compatible with existing facilities. Currently two pilots are in preparation to assess the incremental recovery beyond waterflood and assess the commerciality of miscible EOR in a giant offshore carbonate reservoir. Key learnings in this paper include (i) an efficient methodology to assess phased field development for miscible EOR, (ii) incremental recovery of miscible EOR beyond waterflood, (iii) metallurgy and facility requirements for the two solvent schemes and (iv) a preliminary assessment of field scale commerciality including economics for the two solvents, hydrocarbon gas and CO2. © 2017, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Enhanced recovery; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Metal recovery; Offshore oil well production; Offshore structures; Petroleum reservoirs; Secondary recovery; Solvents; Artificial islands; Carbonate reservoir; Commercial development; Development strategies; Field development; Offshore environments; Preliminary assessment; Support facilities; Petroleum reservoir evaluation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044234329

However, local policies and initiatives, some of which are showcased at the conventions, have shown significant promise in adaptation and mitigation.

Known to adversely affect human health, the impact of bioaerosols on a population often manifests as outbreaks of illnesses such as Legionnaires Disease and Q fever, although the concentrations and environmental conditions in which these impacts occur are not well understood. Bioaerosol concentrations vary from source to source, but specific human activities such as water treatment, intensive agriculture and composting facilitate the generation of bioaerosol concentrations many times higher than natural background levels. Bioaerosols are not considered 'traditional' pollutants in the same way as PM10, PM2.5, and gases such as NO2, and consequently dispersion models do not include a bespoke method for their assessment. As identified in previous studies, priority areas for improving the robustness of these dispersion models include: 1) the development of bespoke monitoring studies designed to generate accurate modelling input data; 2) the publication of a robust emissions inventory; 3) a code of practice to provide guidelines for consistent bioaerosol modelling practices; and 4) a greater understanding of background bioaerosol emissions. The aim of this research project, funded by the Natural Environmental Research Council (NERC), is to address these key areas through a better understanding of the generation, concentration and potential dispersion of bioaerosols from intensive agricultural and biowaste facilities, using case studies developed at specific locations within the UK. The objective is to further refine existing bioaerosol monitoring and modelling guidelines to provide a more robust framework for regulating authorities and site operators. This contribution outlines the gaps that hinder robust dispersion modelling, and describes the on-site bioaerosol data collection methods used in the study, explaining how they might be used to close these gaps. Examples of bioaerosol dispersion modelled using ADMS 5 are presented and discussed. © 2017 WIT Press.","ADMS; Bioaerosols; Composting; Dispersion modelling",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029797166

With the use of currently available technologies, GTI developed a field method to measure methane emissions from various sources within the natural gas distribution system and conducted a national field campaign to collect measurements of various types of leaks on underground pipelines as well as above ground assets. Using these technologies and accounting for current practices for leak detection and repair have resulted in a significant decrease in methane emissions from the distribution sector. Leveraging the information from these studies will help with the prioritization of leak repairs to optimize methane emissions reduction and reduce environmental impacts as well as increase safety for customers. Additional safety measures are also being explored which include implementing the use of methane detectors for residential customers. These detectors can warn customers of increased levels of methane, and as a result immediate action can be taken such as alerting the local utility company to a potential leak. Having an early warning system in residential homes can improve safety and prevent unfortunate events from occurring due to unreported or undetected gas leaks. A national pilot study was conducted that evaluated the performance of these detectors in various residential settings. Improving the current understanding of methane emissions and developing new technologies for methane detection for the gas infrastructure as well as within customer homes will help ensure that natural gas continues to play an important role in a clean energy future.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057307333

Similarly, landfills emit large quantities of methane, which is primarily flared or vented. Both these activities result in large scale energy waste and undesired methane and carbon dioxide emissions. This work examines the benefits of using excess natural gas to harvest atmospheric moisture. Natural gas-powered refrigeration systems can enable large scale dehumidification via condensation. The harvested water can be used for waterintensive operations like hydraulic fracturing, drilling and waterflooding in nearby oilfields. This solution thus addresses the issues of energy waste, water and greenhouse gas emissions A first-order model is used to estimate the water harvest, based on the gas flow rate, ambient weather and the refrigeration system. The benefits of flared gas-powered water harvesting are quantified for the Eagle Ford (Texas) and the Bakken (North Dakota) Shales, which account for the bulk of US flaring. The benefits of landfill gas-powered water harvesting are quantified for the Barnett (Texas), and Monterey (California) Shales, which can be served by 30 and 15 landfills, respectively. Overall, flared gas utilization for water production can meet 15% and 60% of the annual water requirements of the Eagle Ford and Bakken Shales, respectively. The water harvested using landfill gas (from nearby landfills) can meet 22% and 73% of the annual water requirements of the Barnett and Monterey Shales, respectively. This technology will also eliminate millions of trucking trips to transport water. Overall, this waste-to-value concept has global relevance, since a combination of excess gas availability, water scarcity and hothumid conditions is common in many regions of the world.

The two policies have a similar objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but the policies differ in the manner in which those objectives are met. The RFS imposes a hierarchical mandate of renewable fuel use for each year whereas the LCFS imposes a specific annual carbon-intensity reduction with less of a fuel specific mandate. We model the interactions using a partial-equilibrium structural model of agricultural and energy markets in the US and Rest-of-World regions. Our results suggest the policies are mutually reinforcing in that the compliance costs of meeting one of the requirements is lower in the presence of the other policy.

This article explores these questions using California as a case study. Current trends as well as multiple modeling studies show that existing policy directions for the state will not be sufficient. Additional initiatives appear needed to accelerate adoption of electric vehicles, reduce driving, reach 100 percent renewable electricity, convert existing buildings to zero-net-carbon status, change diet, and reduce consumption. The state’s social ecology does not currently support such changes. Consequently, planners and other professionals need to consider strategic actions to change social ecology as well as climate policy. Potential steps to do this include raising the price of carbon; revising the state’s tax system so as to increase public sector capacity; developing a stronger framework of incentives, mandates, and technical support between levels of government; and expanding educational and social marketing programs aimed at behavior change. A main implication of this analysis is that in many contexts worldwide sustainability planners should consider action on both policy and social ecology levels to maximize chances of success. © 2017 by the author.","2050; California; Carbon neutral; Carbon neutrality; Climate change; Climate planning; Ghg mitigation; Global warming",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044576373

We quantify the global and regional precipitation responses to U.S. SO2 emission reductions using three fully coupled chemistry-climate models: Community Earth System Model version 1, Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Coupled Model 3, and Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE2. We contrast 200 year (or longer) simulations in which anthropogenic U.S. sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions are set to zero with present-day control simulations to assess the aerosol, cloud, and precipitation response to U.S. SO2 reductions. In all three models, reductions in aerosol optical depth up to 70% and cloud droplet number column concentration up to 60% occur over the eastern U.S. and extend over the Atlantic Ocean. Precipitation responses occur both locally and remotely, with the models consistently showing an increase in most regions considered. We find a northward shift of the tropical rain belt location of up to 0.35° latitude especially near the Sahel, where the rainy season length and intensity are significantly enhanced in two of the three models. This enhancement is the result of greater warming in the Northern versus Southern Hemispheres, which acts to shift the Intertropical Convergence Zone northward, delivering additional wet season rainfall to the Sahel. Two of our three models thus imply a previously unconsidered benefit of continued U.S. SO2 reductions for Sahel precipitation. © 2017. American Geophysical Union.

This study develops an innovative approach that combines three physical climate simulations (Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory model, Goddard Institute of Space Studies model, and the United Kingdom Meteorological Office climate model) with a general equilibrium model of global trade in order to study the real economic impacts of climate change. For the most part, climate change projected up to the year 2060 leads to welfare gains in the range of 0.07–1.4%, and welfare losses between 0.04 and 2.2% in some cases. All three climate simulations, point to welfare gains in China and marginal losses in low- and middle-income countries as a result of climate change. These findings underscore the importance of properly accounting for the direct effect of CO2 on crop growth and farm level adaptation, as ignoring these leads to substantial welfare losses in all examined regions. While a more systematic trade-off analysis is required for making strong generalizations, the broadest conclusion from the applied models is that, as long as CO2 fertilization effects and farm level adaptation are fairly included with the simulations, global agriculture does not appear to be particularly threatened by climate change. For this reason, agricultural policies aimed at mitigating CO2 emissions but problematic to food security, especially in developing countries, should be treated with caution. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural production; Climate change; CO2 fertilization effects; Welfare","Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Cost accounting; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Food supply; Investments; Agricultural productions; CO2 fertilization effects; General equilibrium models; Geophysical fluid dynamics laboratory model; Goddard Institute of Space Studies; Innovative approaches; Low and middle income countries; Welfare; Climate change; agricultural policy; agricultural production; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; developing world; economic impact; energy policy; global trade; investment; trade-environment relations; trade-off; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016074411

The WRF-Chem model was run twice for all of Europe at a spatial resolution of 36 x 36 km for the year 2012. In the first simulation we used a static emissions approach (the “BASE” simulation) and in the second simulation we used dynamic ammonia emissions (the “DYNAMIC” simulation). Both simulations underestimate measured concentrations of NH3 for all seasons, have similar NMGE (about 0.7 μg m-3), and model hourly ammonia peaks that shift toward the afternoon hours if compared with measurements. However, for all temporal resolutions, normalised mean gross error in winter and summer is lower for DYNAMIC than for BASE. The DYNAMIC simulation also generally gives worse performance in spring for each temporal resolution. For further improvement of the modelled ammonia concentrations with WRF-Chem we suggest using a nested approach with higher spatial resolution, which will lead to better separation of the ammonia source regions from surrounding areas and take into account national practices and regulations in the emissions model, eventually only in the nested model domain. © 2017, HARD Publishing Company.

From the beginning of the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP), China has adopted a series of policies and measures in ways of improving energy efficiency, optimizing energy structure, developing low-carbon city pilots and so forth. This study takes use of the China-in-Global Energy Model to analyze the future carbon dioxide emissions and energy consumption under different scenarios, and then calculates the contributions of energy efficiency improvement and energy substitution to realizing the mitigation target of China's National Determined Contributions. The results show that energy efficiency improvement plays more important role in reducing carbon intensity than energy substitution. But as time goes on, the contribution of energy substitution will increase while the effect of energy efficiency improvement will diminish gradually.

This article aims to investigate the causality relationships between carbon dioxide emissions and its influencing factors in China through the traditional Granger causality test and the Hiemstra and Jones test. The paper not only considers economic factors, but also takes social factors into consideration. It has been concluded that linear Granger causality relationships exist from CO2 emissions to GDP, gross national income, and freight traffic volume. Compared with linear relationships, unidirectional nonlinear Granger causality relationships run from CO2 emissions to resident consumption levels, and also from the urban population to CO2 emissions. Moreover, there are bidirectional nonlinear causality relationships between CO2 emissions and GDP, and between CO2 emissions and the possession of private automobiles. Finally, based on the above conclusions, this article analyzes energy-saving and emission reduction measures as proposed by the Chinese government, and puts forward policy recommendations to reduce carbon dioxide emissions. © 2017, HARD Publishing Company.

In addition to being significant sources of carbon pollution, cities prove to be dynamic sites of experimentation and ambition on climate policy. However, as U.S. cities set climate change goals far above those of their federal and state counterparts, they are butting up against the limits of their existing legal authority, most notably with regard to control over energy supplies. In response, many U.S. cities are exercising their legal rights to reclaim public ownership or control over private electric utilities as a method of achieving their climate change goals. Although there is widespread desire for cities to act within their legal authority to reduce carbon pollution, it is a different question entirely whether they should be encouraged to expand this authority by reclaiming ownership or control over tasks previously outsourced to private companies. On this question, energy law has much to learn from administrative law’s robust attention to outsourcing theory. This Article draws from the outsourcing literature to argue that climate change complicates traditional theories regarding whether cities should prefer publicly or privately owned electricity systems. By transposing these theories into energy law, it constructs a theoretical defense of why more public forms of energy ownership or control may be effective governance tools for the climate change era. In the last century, providing electricity was a task well suited to government oversight of private companies, as regulators primarily aimed to incentivize low prices and adequate supply. This century, however, climate change creates the need for more deliberative, experimental management of electricity to meet the additional aim of decarbonization while maintaining affordability and reliability. In this situation, outsourcing theory widely counsels against utilizing a private contractor model, and illustrates the difficulties inherent in using regulation to manage private companies. Instead, it is time for broader reconsideration of more public forms of energy control and ownership, of just the sort that leading U.S. cities are pioneering. © 2016 by Shelley Welton.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019246707

Applying a Biomass Resource Model to evaluate and forecast the types and potential availability of different categories of biomass resources from Brazil – a case study of a country with extensive biomass resources and export potential. This research evaluates Brazil's biomass potential to 2030, and analyses the levels of resource that may be available to export. The research finds that Brazil has extensive biomass resources that are potentially sufficient to both balance Brazilian total primary energy demand by 2030 and for Brazil to increasingly become a major exporter of resource for energy end uses. The paper also discusses the potential impact for global biomass trade, if countries such as Brazil were to adopt energy strategies that resulted in greater domestic use of their available biomass. The research's analysis shows that if the Brazilian Government were to adopt strategies to utilise a greater proportion of its resource for domestic energy, Brazil could export up to >25.8% less biomass by 2030 compared to forecast export levels based on Brazil's current policy framework. © 2017 The Author","Bioenergy; Biomass; Brazil; Policy; Resource; Trade","Commerce; Emission control; Energy management; Forecasting; Greenhouse gases; Public policy; Bio-energy; Bioenergy strategies; Biomass resources; Brazil; Low carbon energies; Primary energy demand; Renewable energies; Resource; Biomass; bioenergy; biomass power; demand analysis; energy policy; energy resource; export; global change; governance approach; renewable resource; resource availability; trade-environment relations; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021643644

This research applied a life cycle assessment approach to examine the human health and ecosystem effects of four bioenergy pathways: direct combustion of wood biomass, direct combustion of forest residue, direct combustion of pellets, and biomass integrated gasification and combined cycle (BIGCC). All pathways showed some variability of impacts; therefore, no single bioenergy pathway was the best absolute option.

However, the global challenge is addressing the so-called Energy Trilemma: how to provide secure, affordable electricity while minimizing the impact of power generation on the environment. The rapid growth in power generation from intermittent renewable sources, such as wind and photovoltaics, to address the environmental aspect has created additional challenges to meet the security of supply and affordable electricity aspects of this trilemma. Fossil fuels play a major role in supporting intermittent renewable power generation, rapidly providing the security of supply needed and ensuring grid stability. Globally diesel or other fuel oils are frequently used as the primary fuel or back-up fuel for fossil-fueled power generation plants at all scales, from a few kiloWatts to hundreds of MegaWatts, and helps provide millions of people with secure electricity supplies. But diesel is a high polluting fuel, emitting high levels of carbon dioxide (CO2) per unit of fuel input compared to natural gas, as well as high levels of combustion contaminants that are potentially hazardous to the local environment and human health. Additionally, diesel can be a high cost fuel in many countries, with imports consuming significant portions of sometimes scarce foreign currency reserves. Most observers consider that natural gas is the 'fuel of choice' for fossil power generation due to its reduced CO2 emissions compared to coal and diesel. However, access to gas supplies cannot be guaranteed even with the increased availability of Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) and Compressed Natural Gas (CNG). Additionally where natural gas is available, operators may opt for an interruptible gas supply contract which offers a lower tariff than a firm gas supply contract, therefore there is a need for a back-up fuel to ensure continuous power supplies. While traditionally diesel or Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) has been used as fuel where gas is not available or as a back-up fuel, propane offers a cleaner and potentially lower cost alternative. This paper compares the potential economic, operational and environmental benefits of using propane as a fuel for gas turbine-based power plants or cogeneration plants. © Copyright 2017 ASME.",,"Boilers; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cell engineering; Coal combustion; Cogeneration plants; Combustion; Compressed natural gas; Condensers (liquefiers); Cooling systems; Economics; Electric power systems; Energy policy; Energy security; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuel oils; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Gas supply; Gas turbines; Gases; Liquefied natural gas; Materials handling; Natural gas; Propane; Steam condensers; Steam generators; Sustainable development; Waste heat; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Environmental aspects; Environmental benefits; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Local environments; Power generation plants; Renewable power generation; Secure electricity supplies; Gas turbine power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029827214

In parallel the uptake of e-mobility is also growing. Although the market position of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV's) is still low, the growth rate is accelerating rapidly. The fast-growing fleet of shared electric vehicles requires a substantial and growing energy supply. With smart charging technologies, the even growing supply of renewables can be used to charge shared cars scheduled at the right moment: when there is a demand for mobility and when there is wind (during the night) and/or when the sun shines. Applying smart charging for shared electric mobility results in a higher utilization of shared electric cars, new business cases for electric mobility, more efficient use of renewables, and avoiding the need to do large investments in the grid.

It seeks to help bridge the research gap regarding non-state actors' (NSAs) influence on the role of the nation-state and the United Nations in global political ecology and environmental policy, including emission reductions, such as anti-deforestation measures, and environmental justice. We consider NSAs as consisting of two heterogeneous global coalitions: a) civil society organizations (CSOs) and environmental non-governmental organizations, and b) peak corporate organizations with green economy objectives, here denominated green business organizations, representing transnational corporations (TNCs). After a review of prior studies, we present a version of an advocacy coalition framework; identify a timeline of changes in UN architecture and simplified NSA influence categories. We only begin to test very broad hypotheses on relative agency and to compare NSA narratives with UN documents. We show that the architecture of the UN has gradually shifted from favoring civil society to corporations. There is evidence that, in the late 1990s, in comparison with CSOs, TNCs increased their access to nation-states and UN agencies. The TNC narrative changed from a) denying climate change and ignoring the UN to b) recognizing change and guiding negotiations. These shifts in UN architecture, TNC agency and narrative appears to have influenced changes in UN documents towards a corporate global environmental framework, reducing their references to the regulatory and enforcement roles of the state and global binding agreements, shifting global debate towards a voluntary corporate orientation. This may have reduced prospects for reducing emissions and increasing environmental justice. Combining market mechanisms with strong regulatory frameworks is best practice for environmental policy. When nation-states have the will and capacity to command and control, they can reduce environmental degradation. Stronger national government competence and enforcement capacity and binding UN agreements are essential for the effectiveness of market incentives, which may be enhanced by business and civil society initiatives. If CSOs can reunite and regain their strength, maybe they could negotiate with TNCs on a more equal footing. Perhaps UN members could once again become comfortable with the idea of strong states and non-hegemonic global governance. © 2020, University of Arizona Libraries.","Climate convention; Earth system governance; Global political ecology; Green economy; Nation-state; Non-state actors; Rio+20; UN agency; UN architecture; UNCED",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089402431

A rarely investigated approach is the energy cooperation which incorporates a jointly operated CHP plant also producing process steam for nearby industry. The present study aims to evaluate economic and environmental effects on the Hofors DH system with jointly operated CHP plant when the nearby steel mill extends the supply of recovered IEH. Various IEH supply opportunities with different capacities of hot water and steam were designed and compared with existing IEH utilization, plant heat and electricity production and DH system performance. The energy system model MODEST is used for cost-optimization. A parametric study is used to analyze influences of increasing IEH cost and fluctuating electricity prices. The results show advantages for the DH system to utilize IEH for deliveries of DH and process steam and the cogeneration of electricity. Economic and environmental benefits are decreased total system cost (−1.67 MEUR/a), less use of fuels and electricity, and reduced CO2emissions with a maximal reachable amount of 28,200 ton/a when the use of biofuel is assumed as limited resource and the substituted marginal electricity production is based on coal-condensing power plants. The results also show that industrial steam is a preferred heat supply source as long as the steam cost is below the alternative heat production cost, irrespective of the electricity price. While the cost-effective utilization of industrial hot water for DH is more sensitive and affected by a beneficial CHP production based on higher electricity price segments, it is also shown that utilization of continuously supplied industrial hot water is limited during seasons of low DH demand. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CHP; CO2emission; Energy use; Marginal electricity; MODEST; System cost","Carbon dioxide; Coal deposits; Cogeneration plants; Cost effectiveness; Costs; District heating; Economic analysis; Economic and social effects; Electric power generation; Electric power system economics; Energy utilization; Steam; Water; Coal-condensing power; District heating system; Economic and environmental benefits; Energy use; Environmental analysis; Marginal electricities; MODEST; System costs; Industrial economics; biofuel; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; combined heat and power; commodity price; economic analysis; electricity generation; energy use; environmental impact; heat production; mill; software; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012164014

In this paper the design process of a highly efficient large scale USC steam turbine is presented. Thereby, automated design space exploration based on an optimization algorithm is applied to support the identification of optimal flow path parameters within the preliminary and the detailed design phases. The optimization algorithm is first integrated with a 1D-mean line design code to automatically identify the optimal major turbine layout in terms of number of stages, reaction degrees, flow path geometry and basic airfoil parameters. Based on a progressive multi-section optimization coupled with a parametric airfoil generator and a CFD code, the profile shapes of each airfoil row are adapted to local flow conditions and systematically optimized to minimize aerodynamic losses in each turbine stage. A final 3D flow simulation of one representative optimized stage confirms the achievement of a highly efficient steam turbine design that fulfills both climatic and economic requirements.

Lean premixed combustion is yet also prone to combustion instabilities, resulting in thermoacoustically induced acoustic pressure oscillations (pulsations). Understanding pulsation behavior over an enginés lifetime is of interest to accurately monitor the engine status, as wear and degradation typically affect combustion behavior and result in changes of both pulsations and emissions. Such improved understanding can be exploited for optimizing both the engine operation concept and the design of relevant hardware parts. In return, pulsation and hardware optimization may lead to reduced degradation and thus inherently more robust long-Term operational behavior. The study presented here is conducted for one specific gas turbine of GÉs GT24/GT26 fleet with sequential annular combustion. Based on operational data of the examined gas turbine, a semi-empirical modeling approach is introduced to describe the pulsations measured in the first (EV) combustion chamber. The target is to reproduce measured pulsation amplitudes as well as their different behaviors with engine load. The modeling presented here has been focused on pulsations in a distinctive frequency range below 1kHz. A model based on a small set of data obtained from initial commissioning is able to represent the pulsation behavior within a normalized root mean square error of 11%. Validation with long-Term engine data shows that predicted pulsation levels are reasonably matching the initial operation period but increasingly deviate with engine operating time. By using additional data from later engine commissioning and adjustments, the robustness of the model is sensibly increased. Model accuracy on the training dataset remains similar at around 11%, but validation on the long-Term data shows a significant decrease of the normalized root mean square error from over 21% to below 16%. Additional model improvements to further reduce prediction errors on long-Term data have been also identified. © 2017 ASME.",,"Combustion chambers; Engines; Errors; Gas emissions; Hardware; Mean square error; Turbomachinery; Acoustic pressure oscillation; Combustion instabilities; Engine operating time; Hardware optimization; Lean premixed combustion; Root mean square errors; Semi-empirical modeling; State-of-the-art technology; Gas turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030695126

Large and detrimental wildland fires can cause a threat to communities, infrastructures, timber production, recreation opportunities, wildlife habitat and sustainable ecosystem development efforts. Fuel treatment and wildland fire preparedness are two important strategic wildland fire planning programs for the US National Park Service (NPS). The goal of the programs is to mitigate the detrimental effects of wildland fires while promoting their beneficial effects in maintaining and restoring ecosystem conditions. NPS fire planners are tasked with efficiently allocating these fire program budgets to each of the parks. To help inform these decisions a set of production functions were applied to park specific data to describe the return on investments (ROI) at each park for the fuel treatment and preparedness programs. For each park, we calculated the first-order gradients of ROI at pre-selected investment combinations to quantify the marginal returns of investment (MROI) from both management programs. Budget allocation decisions were made by comparing MROI from both programs for all parks in a region. We iteratively allocated funding to each park and fire management programs. Climate change is a major uncertainty in wildland fire management as it may lead to longer and more severe fire seasons. We varied the ROI surfaces and ran additional simulations to study how more severe fire conditions may influence the regional budget allocation decisions. Analysing these results helps managers to identify alternative budget allocation strategies while promoting sustainable development. © 2017 WIT Press.","Climate change; Fuel treatment; Gradient method; Preparedness; Production function; Translog",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029783724

The goal here is to elucidate the processes by which the initially unfueled kernel evolves into a self-sustained flame. Three fuels are examined: a conventional Jet-A and two synthesized fuels that are used to explore fuel composition effects. A commercial, high-energy recessed cavity discharge igniter located at the test section wall ejects kernels at 15 Hz into a preheated, striated crossflow. Next to the igniter wall is an unfueled air flow; above this is a premixed, prevaporized, fuel-air flow, with a matched velocity and an equivalence ratio near 0.75. The fuels are prevaporized in order to isolate chemical effects. Differences in early ignition kernel development are explored using three, synchronized, high-speed imaging diagnostics: schlieren, emission/chemiluminescence, and OH planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF). The schlieren images reveal rapid entrainment of crossflow fluid into the kernel. The PLIF and emission images suggest chemical reactions between the hot kernel and the entrained fuel-air mixture start within tens of microseconds after the kernel begins entraining fuel, with some heat release possibly occurring. Initially, dilution cooling of the kernel appears to outweigh whatever heat release occurs; so whether the kernel leads to successful ignition or not, the reaction rate and the spatial extent of the reacting region decrease significantly with time. During a successful ignition event, small regions of the reacting kernel survive this dilution and are able to transition into a self-sustained flame after ∼1-2 ms. The low aromatic/low cetane number fuel, which also has the lowest ignition probability, takes much longer for the reaction zone to grow after the initial decay. The high aromatic, more easily ignited fuel, shows the largest reaction region at early times.

The engine was just modified with DMCC technology and combined with after-treatment device diesel oxidation catalyst coupled with particulate oxidation catalyst (DPOC). The test results show that it can fully meet the demand of Euro V legislation without the help of selected catalyst reduction (SCR). Additionally, the comparative analysis of the dynamic and economic performances between the DMCC Euro V engine and the baseline Euro IV engine was presented in this study. The regulated emissions (included HC, CO, NOX, PM (particulate matter)) and unregulated emissions (included formaldehyde (HCHO) and unburned methanol (CH3OH)) before and after DPOC from DMCC Euro V engine were also investigated. The dynamic performance of DMCC Euro V engine is basically consistent with the baseline Euro IV engine, while there is a slight deterioration in economic performance at certain operation conditions in terms of calorific value. Compared with the baseline engine before DPOC, the DMCC engine causes an increase in HC, CO, HCHO and CH3OH emissions, but the NOX and PM emissions are much better. The DPOC efficiency in the conversion rate of HC, CO, HCHO and CH3OH is over 98% under the whole ESC test procedure, and for PM, the conversion efficiency is only around 21%.

The effects of the swirl flow and oxygen concentration on spray, combustion and emissions are further investigated. For a non-reacting simulation, it is found that the swirl flow has a contrary effect on the liquid penetration and spray configuration at small and large angles. For combustion simulations, very good agreement with the experimental results is obtained for the heat release rate using the present models. The results show that the swirl flow causes a change in the flame configuration. In addition, strong liquid-gas interactions due to the anti-swirl flow leads to less soot and more NOx emissions.

As the Green for Grain project proceeds, food provision, water regulation and climate regulation services in the Northern Shaanxi Loess Plateau (NSLP) are changing and have caused broad attention. In this study, the dynamic pattern of the normalized differential vegetation index (NDVI) and the main drivers of grain production (GP), water yield (WY) and net primary production (NPP) in the NSLP from 2000-2013 are identified by incorporating multiple data and methods, in order to provide a better understanding of how and why ES change during ecological restoration. WY was simulated by hydrological modeling, and NPP was estimated with the Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA) model. The results show that vegetation restoration continued from 2000-2013, but fluctuated because of the comprehensive influence of climate and human activity. GP and NPP both exhibited significantly increasing trends, while changes in WY occurred in two stages: decline (2000-2006) and growth (2007-2013). Spatially, significantly increasing trends in NPP and WY were detected in 52.73% and 24.76% of the region, respectively, in areas that correspond with the Green for Grain project and high precipitation growth. Correlation and partial correlation analyses show that there were different dominant factors (i.e., natural vs. anthropogenic) driving ES change in the NSLP from 2000-2013. The change in WY was mainly driven by precipitation, while the improvements in GP and NPP can be attributed to investments in natural capital (i.e., chemical fertilizer, agricultural machinery power and afforestation). We also found that vegetation restoration can produce positive effects on NPP, but negative effects on WY by using response analyses of WY or NPP change to NDVI change, demonstrating that additional research on the role of water in vegetation restoration is needed. Our results provide support for ES management and the sustainable development of ecological restoration in the NSLP. © 2017 by the author.","Grain production; Loess Plateau; Net primary production; Vegetation restoration; Water yield","climate change; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; environmental restoration; investment; natural capital; nature conservation; NDVI; net primary production; restoration ecology; seed production; vegetation structure; water yield; China; Loess Plateau; Shaanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013374193

We tested behavioral and structural ventilation interventions on indoorPM2.5 in Dhaka, Bangladesh.Werecruited 59 good ventilation (window or door in ≥ 3 walls) and 29 poor ventilation (no window, one door) homes. We monitored baseline indoor and outdoor PM2.5 for 48 hours. We asked all participants to increase ventilation behavior, including opening windows and doors, and operating fans. Where permitted, we installed windows in nine poor ventilation homes, then repeated PM2.5 monitoring. We estimated effects using linear mixed-effects models and conducted qualitative interviews regarding motivators and barriers to ventilation. Compared with poor ventilation homes, good ventilation homes were larger, their residents wealthier and less likely to use biomass fuel. In multivariable linear mixed-effects models, ventilation structures and opening a door or window were inversely associated with the number of hours PM2.5 concentrations exceeded 100 and 250 μg/m3. Outdoor air pollution was positively associated with the number of hours PM2.5 concentrations exceeded 100 and 250 μg/m3. Few homes accepted window installation, due to landlord refusal and fear of theft. Motivators for ventilation behavior included cooling of the home and sunlight; barriers included rain, outdoor odors or noise, theft risk, mosquito entry, and, for fan use, perceptions of wasting electricity or unavailability of electricity. We concluded that ventilation may reduce indoor PM2.5 concentrations but, there are barriers to increasing ventilation and, in areas with high ambient PM2.5 concentrations, indoor concentrations may remain above recommended levels. © 2017 by The American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene.",,"air pollution; Bangladesh; biomass; controlled study; cooling; electricity; fear; household; human; intervention study; interview; lowest income group; monitoring; mosquito; noise; nonhuman; odor; particulate matter; perception; resident; statistical model; sunlight; theft; urban area; air conditioning; analysis; Bangladesh; environmental monitoring; environmental planning; family size; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; pilot study; poverty; statistics and numerical data; urban population; particulate matter; Air Pollution, Indoor; Bangladesh; Environment Design; Environmental Monitoring; Family Characteristics; Particulate Matter; Pilot Projects; Poverty Areas; Urban Population; Ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900453621

The technology has come so far as to be able to elapse diesel powered irrigation systems in terms of the payback period and reduction in greenhouse gasses. However, PV technologies are still not being used extensively due to their high initial investment costs and compared to other renewable energy technologies the carbon footprint is still comparatively large. On the other hand, solar thermal technologies are seen to be much cheaper, and have a much smaller carbon footprint, but are marred by low efficiencies. This paper investigates solar powered irrigation technologies (PV and solar thermal technologies) that can be utilised by independent farmers in small-scale remote rural farms in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Stochastic parameterizations have the potential to mitigate this problem by representing unpredictable subgrid variability that is left out of deterministic models. We evaluate the impact on the statistics of tropical rainfall of two stochastic schemes: the stochastically perturbed parameterization tendency scheme (SPPT) and stochastic kinetic energy backscatter scheme (SKEBS), in three climate models: EC-Earth, the Met Office Unified Model, and the Community Atmosphere Model, version 4. The schemes generally improve the statistics of simulated tropical rainfall variability, particularly by increasing the frequency of heavy rainfall events, reducing its persistence and increasing the high-frequency component of its variability. There is a large range in the size of the impact between models, with EC-Earth showing the largest improvements. The improvements are greater than those obtained by increasing horizontal resolution to ∼20 km. Stochastic physics also strongly affects projections of future changes in the frequency of extreme tropical rainfall in EC-Earth. This indicates that small-scale variability that is unresolved and unpredictable in these models has an important role in determining tropical climate variability statistics. Using these schemes, and improved schemes currently under development, is therefore likely to be important for producing good simulations of tropical variability and extremes in the present day and future. © 2017.

One of the more restrictive regulations is the one concerning emissions generated by modern passenger vehicles. Constructional solutions used there could be a guideline for the construction of drives for non-road machines, for which regulations are much more liberal. The second approach to reduce emissions, but also to increase the efficiency of the combustion engines is the adaptive control system that is used in non-road machines such as mobile wood chipper. The article gives an equation to determine fuel consumption in a selected range of one cycle of chipper work. It allows to evaluate the performance of the wood chipper depending on the control system used. In order to obtain simulation data to compare the adaptive control system and control system commonly used by manufacturers the researchers tested the combustion engine with spark ignition 1.4 59kW which was installed in the Skoda Fabia. The theoretical analysis showed that the proposed adaptive control system is much more efficient (it is characterized by lower fuel consumption) in sequential operating conditions, eg. in wood chipper used in households. © 2017 Kaunas University of Technology.

The future perspective of active citizenship in the production of locally generated low-carbon energy is largely dependent on the existing institutional and policy frameworks and settings. Subnational governments, in particular, can have a prominent role in this process by engaging in institutional adaptation and policy innovation. The central research question of this paper is: In what ways do local and regional governments innovate in governing to respond to the emergence of LLCEIs? The research question is answered by comparing two case studies: the Dutch regions of Overijssel and Fryslân. We have conceptualized a meta-governing approach of experimentation, characterizing the innovations in governing that emerge when governments respond to the emergence of LLCEIs. We specifically focus on two capacities that subnational governments can use to enhance their governing capacity vis-à-vis LLCEIs and which substantiate the experimental meta-governance mode: institutional adaptation and policy innovation. We then formulated hypotheses that specify the expected policy innovations and institutional adaptations employed vis-à-vis LLCEIs. Data collection involved in-depth interviews and use of secondary data. The results show that a balancing process of authoritative and enabling modes of governing particularly characterized the type of policy innovations that were developed and the institutional adaptations that took place. Both provinces govern LLCEIs at arm's length and issue significant capacity-building strategies that vary in terms of their conditions. Municipalities, however, incline towards impromptu and opportunistic responses, some of them having lasting effects by patching up existing institutional settings, others having more of an episodic character. The results will further the understanding of subnational low-carbon policy and governance innovation processes vis-à-vis the role of LLCEIs. © 2017 by the authors.","Energy transition; Governance; Institutional adaptation; Local low-carbon energy initiatives; Low-carbon policy; Policy innovation; Subnational governments","adaptive management; citizenship; data management; energy efficiency; environmental planning; environmental policy; exploration; governance approach; innovation; institutional framework; policy analysis; Friesland; Netherlands; Overijssel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011032565

The most amounts of crude palm oil produced from Asian region can be an alternative fuel, sustainably. By the modifying crude palm oil into pure palm oil biodiesel (POB100), alkali trans-esterification procedure was operated. In the present, the high-quality POB products have been investigated considerably for alternative fuel in 4-cylinders high-speed diesel engine. The aim of this paper is to study in the improvement of POB quality by repeated-distillation and blending POB with nano-ZnO additive. The high-speed engine combustion from consuming blended POB fuel were investigated the influences of exhaust emission under speed engine operation of 2,000 rpm and 3,000 rpm. The experimental results were shown that the POB fuel yielded at 84.54% from using 400 g. of raw materials. Both of redistilled POB and POB blended with nano-ZnO additive showed the improvement of physical properties including viscosity, specific gravity and cetane number values being under ASTM standard values for high-speed engine. In addition, the results of exhaust emission from the engine showed the effective decrease of carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2) around 13% due to using redistilled POB and POB blended nano-ZnO additive compared with diesel fuel.

Sinkholes may develop when acidic water starts to dissolve the surface of bedrock or bedding planes. The dissolution characteristics of limestone play a crucial role in the development of sinkholes. The main objective of this study was to develop a quantitative tool for evaluating the dissolution ability for sinkhole formations in the karst regions of Guizhou. The present study investigates a number of properties of limestone that may influence the dissolution in the karst regions of Guizhou. Over 200 rock samples were collected and tested to determine the CaO/MgO ratio, clast content, clastic/matrix ratio, primary porosity, permeability, and fracture density. A quantitative approach was developed to synthesize the influences of these multiple factors to establish the order of the limestone solubility in different regions of Guizhou via numerical modeling using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) theory. It was found that the solubility of the karstic limestone from different geological formations was in the following descending order: Carboniferous Huanglong-Maping Formation, Permian Qixia-Maokou Formation, Cambrian Qingxudong Formation, and Triassic Yongningzhen Formation. As the water-bearing capacity of the geological formations in these regions is closely associated with underground cavern and sinkhole formations, the approach explored in the present study may have strong implications for the exploration and utilization of karst groundwater resources.

The urban climate was here evaluated using the urban environmental simulation system scSTREAM, and the mitigation solutions of urban typology optimizing are proposed in the discussion. The change in the urban micro-climate along with the change in urban typology were indicated, and the proposed solutions indicate in detail the impact of various solutions on different urban conditions.

Especially in China, rapid, large-scale urban development is producing urban climate change in large cities, creating other urban environmental problems such as haze weather. Currently, studies are being conducted in China to reveal the impact of urban development on urban climate change. Few studies, however, have focused on microscale urban planning styles and urban typology. High-density building development will change the urban typology, leading to changes in the urban sky view factor (SVF) and microclimate. Our previous study explored the relationship between SVF and the UHI effect by assessing the effect of SVF on the urban thermal environment. Since the energy consumed by indoor heating and air conditioning is affected by mean air temperature (Ta), a high SVF should be considered in the urban planning stage. In this study, we analyzed typical urban planning styles in China. We selected microscale residential districts in Xi'an to represent the typical urban typology of residential districts that developed during different periods and used the numerical urban simulation system ENVI-met to evaluate the impact of urban typology change on urban climate change. Using this approach, we determined the effects of building density, building styles, and vegetation system design, thus demonstrating the mechanism of urban climate change in China's larger cities. This analysis of planning styles can provide guidance for future environmental urban development. © 2017 The Authors.","environmental simulation; urban climate change; urban planning; urban typology","Air conditioning; Atmospheric temperature; Housing; Tantalum compounds; Urban growth; Urban planning; Environmental problems; Environmental simulation; Mean air temperatures; Outdoor thermal comfort; Residential development; Residential districts; Urban thermal environment; urban typology; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020775376

In a wide range of engines such as gas turbines, diesel and gasoline engines, fuel and air mixing primarily controls engine efficiency, combustion emissions, and in extreme cases engine failure. The objective of this research is to investigate the fundamentals of fuel-air mixing using high-speed laser diagnostics that are capable of capturing spatio-temporal dynamics in mixing in the turbulent flows associated with these combustion devices. In particular, we use cutting-edge, ultrashort-pulse (femtosecond-duration) two-photon laser-induced fluorescence (fs-TPLIF) imaging technique for high-speed imaging of characteristic turbulent jets. TPLIF technique, when employed with an inert gas tracer such as Kr can provide images of mixing flow fields of gas jets. Specifically, in the current study, atomic krypton is excited from the 4p6(1S0) state to 5p’[3/2]2 state by using 204.1-nm radiation, and the fluorescence signal is detected from 5p’[3/2]2 state to 5s’[3/2]2 state near 826-nm. The effects of Kr seed concentration, total pressure and laser pulse energy were investigated, as well as the signal dependence on various quenching partners. Furthermore, high-speed imaging measurements of Kr-PLIF show its potential in capturing the spatial and temporal dynamics of mixing process in turbulent flow fields. © 2017 by Waruna D. Kulatilaka.

N2O emission from biofilm in a one-stage completely autotrophic nitrogen removal system was investigated using microelectrodes in this study. It is indicated that the pathways of nitrogen transformation in biofilm mainly included partial nitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox), also included nitrification and heterotrophic denitrification (HD). Ammonium-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) denitrification and HD were the main pathways resulting in N2O production in the biofilm, and hydroxylamine (NH2OH) oxidation was a subordinate pathway. In addition, the amount of N2O emission in test in which both NH4+and NO2−were added (NH4+-N: NO2−-N = 1:1) was about 2 times greater than that in test with NH4+addition only.

Since the logistics industry is an important source of carbon emissions, it is becoming more and more important to reduce carbon emissions in logistics operation. In this paper, we study a low carbon for location routing problem with heterogeneous fleet, simultaneous pickup-delivery and time windows and design a two-phased hybrid heuristic algorithm to solve the problem. Firstly, we introduce the concept of temporal-spatial distance and use genetic algorithm to cluster the customer points to construct the initial path. Then, we use variable neighborhood search algorithm for local search. By incorporating the idea of simulated annealing algorithm into the framework of variable neighborhood algorithm, the global optimization ability of the algorithm is improved. At the same time, the vehicle adjustment strategy is added in the optimization process. The computational experiments are implemented to investigate the performance of the proposed heuristic algorithm. Computational results show that the initial solution considering temporal-spatial distance has obvious advantages in the efficiency of the algorithm and the quality of the solution. © 2017 The Author(s).","location routing problem; temporal-spatial distance; two-phase heuristic algorithm; VNS","Climate change; Computational efficiency; Genetic algorithms; Global optimization; Heuristic algorithms; Knowledge based systems; Location; Optimization; Pickups; Problem solving; Simulated annealing; Computational experiment; Global climate changes; Hybrid heuristic algorithms; Location routing problem; Simulated annealing algorithms; Spatial distance; Two-phase heuristic algorithm; Variable neighborhood search; Clustering algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032393700

Carbonic anhydrases (CAs) convert CO2 to HCO3− and play important roles in biomineralization process from invertebrate to vertebrate. In the present study, a CA (designated as CgCA) was identified and characterized in Pacific oyster C. gigas. The cDNA of CgCA was of 927 bp encoding a predicted polypeptide of 308 amino acids with a signal peptide and a CA catalytic function domain. The mRNA transcripts of CgCA were constitutively expressed in all tested tissues with the highest levels in mantle and hemocytes. During the early development period, the mRNA transcripts of CgCA could be detected in all the stages with the highest level in D-veliger larvae. Elevated CO2 increased the mRNA transcripts of CgCA in muscle, mantle, hepatopancreas, gill and hemocytes significantly (p &lt; 0.05) and induced the translocation of CgCA in hemocytes and mantle. Moreover, elevated CO2 also caused the decrease of intracellular Ca2+ in hemocytes (p &lt; 0.05). The inhibition of CA by acetazolamide and suppression of CgCA gene via RNA interference could increase the intracellular Ca2+ in hemocytes (p &lt; 0.05). Besides, the decrease of intracellular Ca2+ content caused by Ca2+ reagent ionomycin could affect localization of CgCA in mantle tissue. The results indicated CgCA played essential roles in calcification and elevated CO2 accelerated the mutual modulation between calcium and CgCA, implying reduced calcification rate and dissolved shells under OA. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Calcification; Carbonic anhydrase; CO2 exposure; Crassostrea gigas; Ocean acidification","calcium ion; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; messenger RNA; calcium; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; messenger RNA; water pollutant; biomineralization; calcification; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbonate; mollusc; ocean acidification; RNA; shell; animal cell; animal experiment; animal shell; animal tissue; Article; blood cell; calcium cell level; controlled study; Crassostrea gigas; embryo; enzyme inhibition; enzyme localization; female; gene repression; gill; hepatopancreas; in vivo study; male; mantle (mollusc); muscle; nonhuman; ocean acidification; ontogeny; phylogeny; priority journal; protein expression; protein transport; RNA transcription; sea pollution; animal; animal shell; Crassostrea; drug effects; environmental monitoring; genetics; larva; metabolism; sea; toxicity; water pollutant; Crassostrea gigas; Invertebrata; Vertebrata; Animal Shells; Animals; Calcium; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Anhydrases; Crassostrea; Environmental Monitoring; Gills; Hemocytes; Hepatopancreas; Larva; Oceans and Seas; RNA, Messenger; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021298808

In this paper, based on the purpose of efficiency optimization, both engine and generator are matched to get a public high efficiency region, and a partial power following control strategy was presented. The engine speed is constant in the defined power range, so the output power regulation of the range extender is only realized by the adjustment of the torque of the generator. Engine speed and generator torque were decoupled. An improved proportional resonant (PR) controller is adopted to achieve fast output power regulation. In order to ensure the response characteristics of the control system and to improve the robustness, the impacts on system's characteristics and stability caused by PR controller and parameters in the inner-current loop were analyzed via frequency response characteristics. A pre-Tustin with deviation compensation is proposed for PR controller's discretization. A stable and robust power following control method is obtained for the range extender control system.

Although CDs are currently the subject of intensive research activity, the exact structure of their effective fluorophore species has to be clarified because it can depend on the starting materials and reaction conditions. Most importantly, the limited photostability of some CDs presents an impediment to the much-needed breakthroughs required in the field. In this work, the photobleaching of CDs synthesized hydrothermally from citric acid and urea under various conditions is studied in detail. By visualizing changes in the absorption and fluorescence properties of CDs over time upon exposure to UV-light by means of in situ spectroscopic probes, we demonstrate a trade-off between high initial quantum yield and photostability. We found that the CDs consist of low-molecular weight fluorophores bound to π-conjugated domains (carbon core). In the case of CDs synthesized at higher reaction temperatures and/or for longer reaction times, lower initial quantum yields and higher photostability originate from partial conversion of the low-molecular weight fluorophores to π-conjugated domains during synthesis. Thus, the remaining surface bound fluorophores are bound to larger π-conjugated domains, which, in turn, enable dissipation of absorbed UV-energy and protection against photochemical damage. Reference experiments were performed with citrazinic acid-a pyridone-based structure-using ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopy, steady-state spectroscopy, and theoretical DFT simulations. We conclude that pyridone-like structures are most likely responsible for both the high quantum yields and the photobleaching of CDs. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Fluorescence; Laser spectroscopy; Light; Luminescence; Molecular weight; Photobleaching; Quantum yield; Urea; Fluorescence properties; Fluorescence quantum yield; Fluorophore structure; Low molecular weight; Luminescence properties; Reaction temperature; Steady state spectroscopy; Time-resolved spectroscopy; Fluorophores",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021736432

China has the second largest area under rice cultivation, so determining the relationships between the emission of greenhouse gases and soil carbon content, nutrient availabilities and concentrations and physical properties is crucial for minimizing the climatic impacts of rice agriculture. We examined soil nutrients and other properties, greenhouse-gas production and their relationships in 26 paddy fields throughout the province of Fujian in China, one of the most important provinces for rice production. High P and K concentrations, contents and availabilities were correlated with low rates of CO2 production, whereas high C and N contents were correlated with high rates of CH4 production. Mean annual precipitation (MAP) and rates of gas production were not clearly correlated, at least partly due to the management of flooding that can mask the effect of precipitation. Higher mean annual temperatures and soil Fe contents favored the production of N2O. C, N, P and K concentrations and their ratios, especially the C:K and N:K ratios, and P availability were correlated with CO2 and CH4 production across the province, with higher C:K and N:K ratios correlated positively with increased CO2 production and available P correlated negatively with CH4 production. A management strategy to avoid excessive C accumulation in the soil and to increase P availability and decrease available Fe contents would likely decrease the production of greenhouse gases. © 2017","CH4 flux; Diurnal variation; Elemental stoichiometry; Greenhouse gases; N2O flux; Nitrogen; Paddy field; Phosphorus; Seasonal variation; Soil nutrients; Warming","Agricultural robots; Carbon dioxide; Cultivation; Greenhouse gases; Iron; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Soils; CH4 flux; Diurnal variation; Paddy fields; Seasonal variation; Soil nutrients; Warming; Soil pollution; carbon; carbon dioxide; iron; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; phosphorus; potassium; agricultural soil; carbon dioxide; chemical composition; climate effect; concentration (composition); crop production; diurnal variation; flux measurement; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; nutrient availability; paddy field; phosphorus; rice; seasonal variation; soil carbon; soil chemistry; soil emission; soil nitrogen; soil nutrient; stoichiometry; warming; Article; China; greenhouse gas; nonhuman; nutrient; precipitation; priority journal; rice; soil; temperature; China; Fujian",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020889500

This work reports the synthesis of hybrid carbon@TiO2 hollow spheres by a facile and green method using a carbon nanosphere template. The carbon content of the carbon@TiO2 composites was adjusted by changing the duration of the final calcination step, and was shown to significantly affect the physicochemical properties and photocatalytic activity of the composites. The optimized carbon@TiO2 composites exhibited enhanced photocatalytic activity for CO2 reduction compared with commercial TiO2 (P25): the photocatalytic CH4 production rate (4.2 μmol g−1 h−1) was twice that of TiO2; moreover, a large amount of CH3OH was produced (at a rate of 9.1 μmol g−1 h−1). The significantly improved photocatalytic activity was not only due to the increased specific surface area (110 m2 g−1) and CO2 uptake (0.64 mmol g−1), but also due to a local photothermal effect around the photocatalyst caused by the carbon. More importantly, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) showed a remarkable enhancement of light absorption owing to the incorporation of the visible-light-active carbon core with the UV light-responsive TiO2 shell for increased solar energy utilization.

This is particularly true for research focused on the evaluation of adaptive forest management strategies. In this study, we developed an application, ClimateAP, to generate scale-free (i.e., specific to point locations) climate data for historical (1901-2015) and future (2011-2100) years and periods. ClimateAP uses the best available interpolated climate data for the reference period 1961- 1990 as baseline data. It downscales the baseline data from a moderate spatial resolution to scale-free point data through dynamic local elevation adjustments. It also integrates and downscales the historical and future climate data using a delta approach. In the case of future climate data, two greenhouse gas representative concentration pathways (RCP 4.5 and 8.5) and 15 general circulation models are included to allow for the assessment of alternative climate scenarios. In addition, ClimateAP generates a large number of biologically relevant climate variables derived from primary monthly variables. The effectiveness of the local downscaling was determined based on the strength of the local linear regression for the estimate of lapse rate. The accuracy of the ClimateAP output was evaluated through comparisons of ClimateAP output against observations from 1805 weather stations in the Asia Pacific region. The local linear regression explained 70%-80% and 0%-50% of the total variation in monthly temperatures and precipitation, respectively, in most cases. ClimateAP reduced prediction error by up to 27% and 60% for monthly temperature and precipitation, respectively, relative to the original baselines data. The improvements for baseline portions of historical and future were more substantial. Applications and limitations of the software are discussed. © The Author(s) 2017.","Biologically relevant climate variables; Downscaling; Dynamic local regression; Future climate; Historical climate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041537926

Design/methodology/approach: The authors collected secondary information through a desktop review of policy documents, action plans and published reports. Face-to-face interviews with policy makers, agriculture and climate experts representing the government, non-governmental organizations, international development agencies and the private sector were also conducted to validate the secondary information. Findings: The results revealed that agriculture is the dominant economic mainstay providing livelihood to over 70 per cent, employing 60 per cent of the labor force and contributing about 22 per cent of the regional gross domestic product. Climate impacts, such as floods, sea level rise and salt intrusion, increased frequency and intensity of storms, and pests combined with increasing water scarcity continue to reduce arable land, reduce yield of crops and threaten the food security of farmers. Adaptation efforts include using improved varieties of crop; changing cropping patterns and planting seasons; and water conservation techniques. However, progress remains low because of a lack of adequate technical knowledge and financial resources. Originality/value: The amount of published literature on climate change and its impact on agriculture is increasing, but there is little effort to analyze and document impacts and strategies to adapt small farm holders to climate change at a landscape level, particularly in South Asia. This study fills in this gap and will serve as a valuable source of information for those wishing to conduct research or develop adaptation strategies for any of the four countries of Bangladesh, Bhutan, India and Nepal. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate change; Food security; Mitigation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027508231

In future, oil might still be available at higher prices than today, but the climate change implications of oil use will remain. As evidenced by the continued rise in global transport GHG emissions, conventional proposed solutions for mitigation are not working. Accordingly, this paper examines whether the new information technologies can contribute in a major way to the environmental sustainability of global passenger transport. The main finding is that the two technologies considered here-travel substitution and smart cities-could potentially increase or decrease greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, both travel substitution and smart transport, if given the right policy support, could be important means for enabling people and organisations to cope with the need for reduced travel in a climate-constrained future.","global climate change; ICTs; smart transport; sustainable transport; travel substitution","Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Business-as-usual; Communication technologies; Environmental sustainability; Global climate changes; ICTs; Passenger transport; smart transport; Sustainable transport; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041506443

Here, we report a simple ethanol solvothermal method toward precise control of the growth of the sp2 hybrid carbon configurations/clusters in the sp3 carbon matrix so as to regulate the structure of electronic energy bands in the graphene oxide system. The results of morphology observation, XPS, solid-state 13C MAS NMR, FT-IR and Raman spectroscopy proved that controllable generation of the sp2 hybrid carbon configurations/clusters can be achieved based on an executive oxidation/reduction strategy. Upon excitation by a 532 nm laser with 4 ns pulses, the obtained reduced graphene oxide (160-rGO-6) with a large number of sp2 hybrid carbon configurations displays greater nonlinear reverse saturable absorption response and a higher nonlinear absorption coefficient β of 560 cm GW-1 than graphene oxide with different oxidation degree (GO-X, X = 6, 8, 10 and 12), and reduced graphene oxide with relatively few sp2 hybrid carbon configuration ratios (Y-rGO-6, Y = 80, 100, 120, 140 and 180).

Although conversion of existing agriculturally intensive lands (e.g., maize and soy) to perennial bioenergy cropping systems has been shown to reduce near-surface temperatures, unintended consequences on natural water resources via depletion of soil moisture may offset these benefits. The hydroclimatic impacts associated with perennial bioenergy crop expansion over the contiguous United States are quantified using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model dynamically coupled to a land surface model (LSM). A suite of continuous (2000-09) medium-range resolution (20-km grid spacing) ensemble-based simulations is conducted using seasonally evolving biophysical representation of perennial bioenergy cropping systems within the LSM based on observational data. Deployment is carried out only over suitable abandoned and degraded farmlands to avoid competition with existing food cropping systems. Results show that near-surface cooling (locally, up to 5°C) is greatest during the growing season over portions of the central United States. For some regions, principal impacts are restricted to a reduction in near-surface temperature (e.g., eastern portions of the United States), whereas for other regions deployment leads to soil moisture reduction in excess of 0.15-0.2 m3 m-3 during the simulated 10-yr period (e.g., western Great Plains).

Then, to explore the main factors driving CO2emission changes and to uncover feasible ways to reduce CO2emissions, this paper decomposes changes in energy-related CO2emissions into a population effect (ΔCP), an economic output effect (ΔCQ), an industrial structure effect (ΔCS), an energy intensity effect (ΔCI), an energy structure effect (ΔCM) and a carbon dioxide emission coefficient effect (ΔCU) at both the national and provincial levels based on the Log-Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) method. The results indicate that (1) energy-related CO2emissions rose by approximately 5.46 billion tonnes during the 2000–2014 period, with secondary industry accounting for approximately 80% of total CO2emissions. (2) Economic output (Q) was the dominant positive driving factor, and energy intensity (I) was the dominant negative driving factor. The population changes had a weak positive effect on CO2emissions, but the industrial structure effect and energy structure effect varied considerably over the years without showing clear trends. (3) Over multiple spatial scales, the contribution ratios of the factors varied significantly across provinces; in general, the positive driving effects outweighed the negative inhibiting effects. Based on these empirical findings, policy recommendations to further reduce CO2emissions are provided. The Chinese central and local governments should make full use of the important inhibiting factors, i.e., energy intensity and energy structure, and strive for breakthroughs in secondary sector. © 2017","Centre of gravity; Driving factors; Energy-related CO2emissions; LMDI method","Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Centre of gravity; Contribution ratios; Driving factors; Energy-related CO2emissions; Industrial structures; Lmdi methods; Log mean divisia indices; Policy recommendations; Industrial economics; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; emission control; empirical analysis; gravity field; industrial structure; local government; panel data; spatial distribution; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009165712

An integrated modelling system is needed to evaluate and improve energy performance of urban energy systems' design and operation, from both financial and environmental perspectives. To this end, this paper presents an urban energy co-simulation framework. It is based on co-simulation standard Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI) and CityGML-based semantic 3D city model and utilized programing packages, like PyFMI, FMILibrary, and mosaik, which is capable of orchestrating the execution of dynamic simulation models supporting the for co-simulation.

The development of economy has brought lots of carbon emissions. To explore an effective way to reduce carbon emissions, we applied the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) model to find drivers behind carbon emission from 2003 to 2013. Results showed that, in Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei, economic output was main contributor to carbon emissions. Then we utilized the decoupling model to comprehensively analyze the relationship between economic output and carbon emission. Based on the two-level model, results indicated the following: (1) Industry sector accounted for almost 80% of energy consumption in whole region. The reduced proportion of industrial GDP will directly reduce the carbon emissions. (2) The carbon factor for CO2/energy in whole region was higher than that of Beijing and Tianjin but lower than that of Hebei. The impact of energy structure on carbon emission depends largely on the proportion of coal in industry. (3) The energy intensity in whole region decreased from 0.79 in 2003 to 0.40 in 2013 (unit: tons of standard coal/ten thousand yuan), which was lower than national average.

Presently, limited researches address the GHG emission effects during land consolidation processes; fewer addressed the issue from an ecological land consolidation perspective. This paper, hence, studies on the GHG emission effects of a pilot land consolidation project in China which featured by many ecological designs and engineering measures applied. According to findings from the case study, we argue that, in comparison to the conventional engineering measures applied in typical land consolidation projects of the region, most of the ecological engineering measures can not only enhanced the ecological effects in the project area, but also reduce GHG emissions due to savings in material use, transportation and energy consumption during the land consolidation process with additional advantages in cost efficiency.","Case study; China; Ecological land consolidation; Engineering measures; GHG reduction",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019177963

Objective: This study investigates the historical trend in the long-term exposure to PM2.5 and PM 2.5 -related premature mortality (PM2.5 -mortality) and its response to changes in emission that occurred during 1990–2010 across the northern hemisphere. Implications for future trends in human exposure to air pollution in both developed and developing regions of the world are discussed. Methods: We employed the integrated exposure–response model developed by Health Effects Institute to estimate the PM 2.5 -mortality. The 1990–2010 annual average PM2.5 concentrations were obtained from the simulations using the WRF-CMAQ model. Emission mitigation efficiencies of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), ammonia (NH3), and primary PM are estimated from the PM2.5-mortality responses to the emission variations. Results: Estimated PM 2.5 -mortalities in East Asia and South Asia increased by 21% and 85% respectively, from 866,000 and 578,000 in 1990, to 1,048,000 and 1,068,000 in 2010. PM 2.5 -mortalities in developed regions (i.e., Europe and high-income North America) decreased substantially by 67% and 58% respectively. Conclusions: Over the past two decades, correlations between population and PM 2.5 have become weaker in Europe and North America due to air pollution controls but stronger in East Asia due to deteriorating air quality. Mitigation of primary PM appears to be the most efficient way for increasing health benefits (i.e., providing the largest mortality reduction per unit emissions). However, reductions in emissions of NH3 are needed to maximize the effectiveness of NOx emission controls. © 2017, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

This paper aims to examine energy efficiency and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions abatement costs of city urban areas in China. To this end, an improved slacks-based measure approach is introduced, which considers the linkage between desirable and undesirable outputs. Then, measures of energy efficiency, CO2emission abatement cost and comprehensive state index of CO2emissions abatement cost and CO2emissions reduction potential are defined. The proposed model is then applied to the dataset of 285 cities in China during 2008–2012. The results show that most city urban areas in China have relatively low energy efficiencies. Surprisingly, there are gradually narrowing gaps regarding mean energy efficiencies between areas during 2008–2012. Nevertheless, there are great disparities in energy efficiencies between cities within a typical area, and even a provincial region. It is found that CO2emissions abatement cost in urban China exhibits an increasing trend during the study period. Also, significantly geographic disparities in abatement costs between areas, regions and cites are found. Specifically, energy efficiency has significantly positive correlation with the comprehensive state index in China.

However, along with the highly competitively global marketplace, economic factors are known to directly affect an enterprise's development and its future business. Therefore, selecting the right partner for sustainable collaboration that will lead to improved business performance and reduce carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions is a significant problem for many enterprises. In addition, investigating the economic impact of companies that are charged to protect the environment is becoming increasingly problematic. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to evaluate the comparative efficiencies of 16 Green Logistics Providers (GLPs) in the USA from 2012 to 2015, and the projected four-year period of 2016-2019, by means of an integrated approach that combines the grey forecasting model GM (1,1) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). The results show that there are two GLPs, Knight Transportation and the Union Pacific Corporation, that possess a higher efficiency level and are achieving positive technical change. However, this study also determined that Hyster-Yale Materials Handling and CSX Corporation did not reach an acceptable efficiency score; therefore, they should improve technical efficiency to mitigate environmental concerns. This completely integrative methodology has the potential to provide the best decision-making strategies for finding suitable collaborative partners who are able to meet the sustainability requirements in most economic and environmental areas. © 2017 by the author.","Data envelopment analysis; Green logistics providers; Grey forecasting model; Sustainable development","carbon dioxide; data envelopment analysis; economic impact; environmental protection; forecasting method; integrated approach; logistics; sustainable development; technical efficiency; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013374705

We used extended STIRPAT model (stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology) based on the classical IPAT identity (where I = impact representing carbon emissions, P = population, A = affluence, and T = emission intensity) to determine the main factors driving energy-related carbon emissions in Xinjiang from 1952 to 2014, an important Chinese energy base in northwestern China. Total carbon emissions in Xinjiang were found to increase from 28.51 × 104 t in 1952 to 9,446.61 × 104 t in 2014, representing a 331.34-fold increase over a period of 63 years. Results show that the impacts and influences of various factors on carbon emissions varied among three stages of development: “Before Reform and Opening up” (1952-1977), “After Reform and Opening up” (1978-2000), and “Western Development” (2001-2014). In the first stage, emission intensity and population size were the dominant contributors to increments in carbon emissions, while the energy consumption structure played an important role in curbing carbon emissions. In the second stage, economic growth and population size were the dominant contributors to increments in carbon emissions, while emission intensity had a significant negative effect on carbon emissions. In the third stage, fixed asset investment and economic growth were the dominant contributors to increments in carbon emissions, while emission intensity had a significant negative effect on carbon emissions. © 2017, HARD Publishing Company.

A suite of high-temperature minerals defines the matrix, formed by grain growth in a solid state by static recrystallization of an originally clastic matrix, deposited at temperatures ≥800 °C. This rock type is predominantly a result of the recrystallization of target material driven by the acceleration of hot gasses from volatilized sedimentary cover mixed with variably shocked crystalline basement. Approximately one-third of terrestrial impact structures occur in mixed target rocks; therefore, this type of impactite may be more common than previously realized. Contact metamorphism between entrained sedimentary target rocks and the juxtaposed hot matrix resulted in carbonate decomposition to form a rare spinel-group mineral, magnesioferrite.

These capacity-building projects, in the first phase of 'REDD+ readiness', involve negotiations among national and international actors in which recognition and authority claims are used by participants to influence project-level negotiations. This study analyses the project development negotiations in a World Bank-led REDD+ capacity building regional project, involving six Central African countries between 2008 and 2011. It explores how the project created a 'negotiation table' constituted of national and regional institutions recognised by the donors and governments, and how this political space, influenced by global, regional and national political agendas led to 'instances' of recognition and misrecognition - in which some negotiating parties' claims of representation were acknowledge and affirmed, while others' claims were not.

Earthquakes, tsunami, storm surges, floods, droughts, and cyclones bring about the devastation from which recovery is difficult. This paper aims to describe the on-going impacts of climate change in Samoa for both the natural and social systems. The consequences of climate change are large, and this article seeks to present climate change and disaster response initiatives as seen through the eyes of the ADRA staff over the last 30 years and how this experience is being applied to build community resilience and mitigate against the impacts of climate change. ADRA’s approach to building resilience is by working with the communities directly and improving their “adaptive capacity” and “resilience” to the changes brought by climate change. ADRA works in an integrated manner that attempts to bridge the best available science with the plethora of traditional knowledge that communities have. The paper then describes one of ADRAs projects supported by USAID’s Pacific American Climate Adaptation (PACAM) Fund. The goal of this project is twofold, to reduce poverty while at the same time building community resilience to climate change. The paper then presents the initial lessons learned from this project and implications of our work on both the natural and social systems in Samoa. Without merging both together in implementation, we will not be able to bolster Samoas resilience.

The study area is currently a relatively warm and dry region of Germany. We calculated species distribution models (SDMs) using information on species’ climate envelopes to predict regional species spectra under 63 different climate change scenarios. We complemented this with fine-scale ecological niche analysis using data from 51 vegetation surveys in seven forest reserves in the study area, and tree-ring analysis (TRA) from local populations of five tree species to quantify their sensitivity to climatic extreme years. The SDMs showed that predicted future climate change in the region remains within the climate envelope of certain species (e.g. Quercus petraea), whilst for e.g. Fagus sylvatica, future climate conditions in one third of the scenarios are too warm and dry. This was confirmed by the TRA: sensitivity to drought periods is lower for Q. petraea than for F. sylvatica. The niche analysis shows that the local ecological niches of Quercus robur and Fraxinus excelsior are mainly characterized by soils providing favorable water supply than by climate, and Pinus sylvestris (planted) is strongly influenced by light availability.

Pyrolysis is used to convert lignocellulosic biomass into a complex mixture of phenolic-rich species that can be used in a transportation fuel. Anisole (or methoxybenzene) can be used as a surrogate to represent these phenolic-rich species. Anisole also has attractive properties as a fuel component for use in advanced spark-ignition engines because of its high blending research octane number of 120. Presented in the current work are new measurements of laminar burning velocities, jet-stirred reactor (JSR) speciation of anisole/O2/N2 mixtures, and the development and validation of a detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for anisole. Homogeneous, steady state, fixed temperature, perfectly stirred reactor CHEMKIN simulations were used to validate the mechanism against the current JSR measurements and published JSR experiments from CNRS-Nancy. Pyrolysis and oxidation simulations were based on the experimental reactant compositions and thermodynamic state conditions including P = 1 bar and T = 675-1275 K. The oxidation compositions studied in this work span fuel lean (φ = 0.5), stoichiometric, and fuel rich (φ = 2.0) equivalence ratios. Premixed laminar burning velocities were measured on a heat flux stabilized burner at an unburnt T = 358 K, P = 1 bar and simulated using the CHEMKIN premixed laminar flame-speed module. Under pyrolysis and oxidative conditions, unimolecular decomposition of anisole to phenoxy radicals and methyl radicals was found to be important due to the relatively low bond strength between the oxygen and methyl group, ~65 kcal-mole-1 © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

Livestock production, N fertilizer use and rice cultivation are the main farm activities producing CH4 and N2O, while CO2 emissions are due to land use change. Farming in Asia, Africa and South America contribute 75% of global GHG emissions. Consideration of emission scaled by unit of product such as milk, meat, or grain (GHG intensity) is important when assessing mitigation practices, which should target: reduction in CH4 emission from enteric fermentation and from manure storage; reduction in N2O emissions from soils and CH4 emissions from rice paddies; increase in C uptake and storage on farms. Improved production efficiency of ruminant livestock on farms results in decreased GHG intensity because more production and lower manure volumes are obtained from fewer animals. Direct interventions can also be made to reduce enteric CH4 emissions, such as feeding additives or compounds interfering with microbial processed that result in CH4 production. Reducing CH4 emissions by changing the form of manure stored from liquid to solid; preventing methanogenesis; and capturing the CH4 through covers and flaring or anaerobic digestion; are recommended. Increasing organic matter input to soils or reducing decomposition rates by various practices partly can offset farm level GHG emissions. Management of N fertilizer, and alternative wetting cycles in rice paddy cultivation can reduce N2O and CH4 emissions from soils, respectively. Management packages that consider regional needs, synergies and trade-offs for whole-farm GHG emission reduction need to be developed. © CAB International 2017.","Enteric fermentation; Manure management; Methane; Nitrogen fertilizer; Nitrous oxide; Soil carbon storage",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052792571

To quantify N2O emissions from agroecosystems, which occur as a result of nitrogen (N) cycling, a new physically-based routine was developed for the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model to predict N2O flux during denitrification and an existing nitrification routine was modified to capture N2O flux during this process. The new routines predict N2O emissions by coupling the carbon (C) and N cycles with soil moisture/temperature and pH in SWAT. The model uses reduction functions to predict total denitrification (N2+ N2O) and partitions N2from N2O using a ratio method. The modified SWAT nitrification routine likewise predicts N2O emissions using reduction functions. The new denitrification routine and modified nitrification routine were tested using GRACEnet data at University Park, Pennsylvania, and West Lafayette, Indiana. Results showed strong correlations between plot measurements of N2O flux and the model predictions for both test sites and suggest that N2O emissions are particularly sensitive to soil pH and soil N, and moderately sensitive to soil temperature/moisture and total soil C levels. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Denitrification; Greenhouse gas emissions; Nitrification; Nitrous oxide; pH; Soil carbon; Spatial distribution; SWAT","Denitrification; Ecosystems; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; pH; Soil moisture; Spatial distribution; Nitrous oxide; Physically based; Reduction function; Soil and water assessment tool; Soil carbon; Soil temperature; Strong correlation; SWAT; Soil surveys; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural emission; carbon cycle; denitrification; greenhouse gas; nitrification; nitrogen cycle; nitrous oxide; soil and water assessment tool; soil carbon; soil moisture; soil temperature; spatial distribution; Indiana; Pennsylvania; United States; West Lafayette",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007441068

This model is based on the assumption that the jet is composed of two flows: an external MHD plasma, surrounding an internal highly relativistic plasma of electron-positrons. The leptons present in the spine, responsible of most of the emission, are supposed to be continuously heated via diffuse acceleration along the jet. The model is thus naturally inhomogeneous and includes most of the expected electromagnetic processes in radio loud sources: synchrotron, self-synchrotron Compton and external Compton emission (with Klein-Nishina cross section) on external sources (accretion disk, dusty torus and broad line region), photon-photon absorption and pair creation. A key point of the model is that the jet bulk Lorentz factor is not a free parameter but is the result of the Compton rocket effect and is thus imposed by external sources, themselves constrained by observation. The particles energy distribution is computed coherently along the jet applying energy conservation between heating and cooling and flux conservation, and the emerging spectrum is computed numerically. This model is applied to the quasar 3C273 and successfully reproduces its broad band emission over 15 orders of magnitude. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-Non Commercial-No Derivatives 4.0 International License (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).",,"Cosmic rays; Cosmology; Magnetohydrodynamics; Photons; Rockets; Broad line region; Broadband emission; Electromagnetic process; Energy distributions; Heating and cooling; Orders of magnitude; Photon absorptions; Relativistic plasmas; Fighter aircraft",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85046061297

Climate - and climate change - will play increasingly important roles in these policies. Climate zones defined by the California Energy Commission have long been influential in energy management. For example, recently a two-zone division of Los Angeles (defined by historical temperature averages) was introduced for electricity rate restructuring. The importance of climate zones has been enormous, and climate change could make them still more important. AI can provide improvements on the ways climate zones are derived and managed. This paper reports on analysis of aggregate household electricity consumption (EC) data from local utilities in Los Angeles, seeking possible improvements in energy management. In this analysis we noticed that EC data permits identification of interesting geographical zones - regions having EC patterns that are characteristically different from surrounding regions. We believe these zones could be useful in a variety of urban models. Microclimates are characterized by common patterns of environmental variables, such as temperature, wind, humidity, and vegetation. Our key finding is that regions in which block groups have similar Electricity Consumption patterns over time are topographically-defined basins having common climate patterns. We call these EC-microclimate zones. Because they reflect local topography and climate, but are based only on EC data, they permit development of new solutions with learning methods. Although microclimates are known to play important roles in energy management, and are important aspects of ecosystems for computational sustainability, the complexity of environmental variables makes them hard to quantify. We analyze how microclimates and household electricity consumption are linked to socioeconomic variables like income. We show how learning-based models can be useful in prediction of energy consumption. Related geostatistical methods also can be used to extend models for each microclimate zone to larger-scale models of electricity consumption.

Here we assessed the need for and value of combining air pollution and climate change mitigation measures into one decision-support tool and the existing policy context in which such a tool might be used. We developed a prototype decision-support tool for evaluating measures for coordinated management of air quality and climate change; and administered a survey in which respondents used the prototype to answer questions about demand for such tools and requirements to make them useful. Additionally, the survey asked questions about participants’ awareness of linkages between air pollution and climate change that are crucial for considering synergies and tradeoffs among mitigation measures. Participants showed a high understanding of the linkages between air pollution and climate change, especially recognizing that emissions of greenhouse gases and air pollutants come from the same source. Survey participants were: European, predominantly German; employed across a range of governmental, non-governmental and research organizations; and responsible for a diversity of issues, primarily involving climate change, air pollution or environment. Survey results showed a lack of awareness of decision-support tools and little implementation or regular use. However, respondents expressed a general need for such tools while also recognizing barriers to their implementation, such as limited legal support or lack of time, finances, or manpower. The main barrier identified through this study is the mismatch between detailed information needed from such tools to make them useful at the local implementation scale and the coarser scale information readily available for developing such tools. Significant research efforts at the local scale would be needed to populate decision-support tools with salient mitigation alternatives at the location of implementation. Although global- or regional-scale information can motivate local action towards sustainability, effective on-the-ground implementation of coordinated measures requires knowledge of local circumstances and impacts, calling for active engagement of the local research communities. © 2017 The Author(s).","Air quality; Climate change; Decision-support; Decision-support tools; Policy; Urban","air quality; atmospheric pollution; climate change; cost analysis; decision support system; environmental issue; environmental planning; greenhouse gas; local participation; perception; policy implementation; pollution control; pollution policy; survey method; trade-off; urban planning; Germany",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061809550

Real actions against global warming represent one of the main priorities of the European energy and environment policies. The European Directives regarding the production of renewable energy, the reduction of GHG emissions and sustainable waste management are based on the commitment of member states to implement adequate measures to fulfil them. The production and use of biogas from anaerobic digestion has the potential to satisfy all the three directives simultaneously. The paper presents an innovative integrated technology for obtaining bioenergy by the means of a mixed system of advanced anaerobic digestion simultaneously in two types of digesters through the process of wet, respectively dry fermentation. The two types of digesters are integrated in a modular system designed and built so that is possible to transport it easily form a micro farm to another. The innovative technology for obtaining biogas through advanced anaerobic digestion will be equipped with a real time command and control system of the methanogenesis process, the necessary energy being ensured by using photovoltaic panels. The results obtained through the innovative technology consisting in a modular system with digesters for wet and dry fermentation of agricultural waste allowed to practically fulfil the concept of farmer energetic independence by using renewable energy sources (biogas, photovoltaic panels, agricultural waste, etc.) and to reduce GHG through the controlled neutralization of important quantities of agricultural waste that otherwise would generate important CO2 quantities into the atmosphere.","Anaerobic digestion; Bioenergy; Greenhouse gases; Modular installation; Organic waste","Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Biogas; Climate change; Command and control systems; Fermentation; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Innovation; Photovoltaic cells; Regional planning; Renewable energy resources; Sustainable development; Waste management; Bio-energy; Energy and environment; Innovative technology; Integrated technologies; Organic wastes; Renewable energy source; Sustainable management; Sustainable waste management; Anaerobic digestion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033373113

As a result, gases with significantly different composition will be traded and distributed. Also, variation in the gas composition is likely to occur more frequently and more abruptly. These variations have the associated risk of compromising the availability, efficiency and safety of end-use equipment. To help mitigate the risk for gas engines, a novel gas sensor was developed and demonstrated its utility in a feed-forward gas engine control approach for optimum response to changes in the fuel gas composition and the humidity of the combustion air. Utilizing the clear theoretical relationship between the burning velocity of a given gas/air mixture and the surface temperature of a radiant burner, the gas sensor developed comprises a miniature radiant burner fueled with a combustible mixture of the gas and air under consideration. The gas sensor prototype was tested with a range of gas mixtures of CH4 with varying fractions of the hydrocarbon species, ethane, propane, and butanes, and of inert gases. An excellent linear relationship was found between the computed laminar burning velocity and the measured burner surface temperature. In addition, the effect of changes in the humidity of the combustion air on the burning velocity of the gas/air mixture under consideration were incorporated in the gas sensor. The gas sensor was integrated in an engine controller for the DNV GL test engine. Improved control responses were demonstrated for the NO, emissions of the engine when operating on a range of gas compositions compared to the standard control approach.

The phase of CO2transitions between liquid and supercritical (mostly supercritical for depths greater than 800 m) when injected into the subsurface. This high-density super-critical phase prevents CO2molecules from upward diffusion toward the surface. Many questions arise in the context of coal seam sequestration with respect to its capacity, injectivity, plume movement, and leakage assessment. This work examines the effect of various saturation periods on the permeability evolution of porous coal. In this triaxial study, liquid and supercritical CO2, along with N2were injected into a coal sample from the Jharia coal field (Jharkhand state, India). It was observed that the permeability reduction for liquid CO2was 25%, 13.5% and 1% for 0–20 h phase, 20–40 h phase and 40–60 h phase, respectively. For supercritical CO2, the reduction was observed to be 42.5%, 38.4% and 11%, respectively, for the three saturation cycles. The findings highlight that while high CO2sorption in supercritical phase stores more of the adsorbate, the reduction in permeability slows down injection operation and the saturation induced coal expansion threatens the overall stability of the system. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon storage; Indian coal; Liquid CO2; Permeability; Saturation period; Supercritical CO2","Bituminous coal; Carbon dioxide; Coal deposits; Liquids; Mechanical permeability; System stability; Carbon storage; Geological reservoirs; Indian coals; Permeability evolution; Permeability reduction; Saturation periods; Supercritical CO2; Supercritical phase; Coal storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006851372

Fluctuating oil prices, depleting oil reserves and high level of harmful emissions through the use of conventional diesel forced the research community to focus their attention on the use of biofuels in compression ignition (CI) engines. Extensive use of biofuels offer multitude of advantages such as social structure, self-sustainability, soil development, effective use of cultivable land and self-employment. Butanol and pentanol are the most attractive biofuels, which could relieve energy crisis and reduce carcinogenic particulate matter (PM) emissions that are customary in CI engines. Research in the recent past has witnessed the notable amount of study in the use of these alcohols, mainly because of the improved yield through modern fermentation processes. Present work reviews the literature on the effects of using butanol and pentanol on the combustion, performance and exhaust emissions of CI engines operating under various test conditions. Attention is paid towards the review of strategies employed for use of higher alcohols in neat or in blended form to increase the renewable fraction of fuels in CI engines. The combination of exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) rates, delayed injection and the use of higher alcohols can enable low temperature combustion (LTC) strategy in CI engines, which presents simultaneous reduction in oxides of nitrogen (NOx) and soot emissions with increased efficiency. This paper also summarizes the key findings of earlier researchers contributed for use of biofuels in CI engines emphasizing higher alcohols. These biofuels are potential and attractive alternatives for the use in CI engines for improved performance and substantial reduction of harmful emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Butanol; CI Engines; Combustion; Emissions; Pentanol; Performance","Biofuels; Butenes; Combustion; Energy policy; Engines; Exhaust gas recirculation; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Nitrogen; Particulate emissions; Petroleum deposits; Proven reserves; Temperature; CI engine; Compression-ignition engines; Exhaust gas recirculation rates; Low temperature combustion; Particulate matter emissions; Pentanol; Performance; Simultaneous reduction; Diesel engines",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018917714

The central methodological issues of this debate relate to the proper treatment of normalised temperature anomalies and trends in the studied time series which may be difficult to separate from time-evolving fluctuations. Some argue that temperature variability is indeed increasing globally, whereas others conclude it is decreasing or remains practically unchanged. Meanwhile, a consensus appears to emerge that local variability in certain regions (e.g. Western Europe and North America) has indeed been increasing in the past 40 years. Here we investigate the nature of connections between external forcing and climate variability conceptually by using a laboratory-scale minimal model of mid-latitude atmospheric thermal convection subject to continuously decreasing 'equator-to-pole' temperature contrast ΔT, mimicking climate change. The analysis of temperature records from an ensemble of experimental runs ('realisations') all driven by identical time-dependent external forcing reveals that the collective variability of the ensemble and that of individual realisations may be markedly different -a property to be considered when interpreting climate records. © The Author(s) 2017.",,"climate change; consensus; human; information processing; latitude; North America; thermodynamics; Western Europe; article",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021147181

The calculation of air pollutants was carried out according to the amount of burnt fuel. There are no requirements for waste truck emission levels in low-density areas. Emissions could be reduced if there were requirements to use at least EURO III trucks or trucks that comply with higher standards. The optimisation of discharge frequency needs to be dealt with.

Annual mean concentrations have decreased but are still above 30 μg/m3. For the very first time, a molecular marker source apportionment of ambient organic carbon (OC) and PM2.5 was conducted in Temuco. Primary resolved sources for PM2.5 were wood smoke (37.5%), coal combustion (4.4%), diesel vehicles (3.3%), dust (2.2%) and vegetative detritus (0.7%). Secondary inorganic PM2.5 (sulfates, nitrates and ammonium) contributed 4.8% and unresolved organic aerosols (generated from volatile emissions from incomplete wood combustion), including secondary organic aerosols, contributed 47.1%. Adding the contributions of unresolved organic aerosols to those from primary wood smoke implies that wood burning is responsible for 84.6% of the ambient PM2.5 in Temuco. This predominance of wood smoke is ultimately due to widespread poverty and a lack of efficient household heating methods.

The study mainly focuses on assessing the farmers’ knowledge on climate change and constraints to practice adaptation strategies. The research area is divided into three reaches as head, middle and tail. About 150 farmer respondents were surveyed from each reach were surveyed and this data was used to calculate the adaptive strategy index and problem confrontation index. The results showed that majority of the farmers had experienced climatic events and they majorly perceive an increase in temperature and a decrease in rainfall. In order to cope up with changing climate, the farmers practiced the best strategy within the range of their experience and knowledge. Farmers ranked increased use of irrigation as the most proactive adaptive measure to confront climate change. There is significant evidence detailing the slowing up of adaptation strategies followed by the farmers. Water shortage, financial short-come and unforeseen weather were ranked highest as constraints to cope with climate change by the respondent groups of three reaches. This study could be a preliminary venture in understanding farmers’ perception at a farm level. The research employed only primary data, results from survey at farm level, further continued micro level studies with greater resources and team work would explore other variables at a better note. The outcome of the research would be a comprehensive report to the policy makers and the governmental agencies to facilitate the farmers with appropriate adaptation strategies to the adverse effects of climate change. To enhance options towards tackling the challenges of climate change on farming community, it is essential to have a broader knowledge about their perception of climate change, adaptation strategies followed and their constraints. The field reality being documented endows better understanding about the impacts at grass root level and policy implications can be made by agencies to improve the livelihood of farmers. Major gaps in the literature were filled through a descriptive methodology, using a qualitative approach looks into the perceived changes in rainfall, temperature and other factors indicating climate change, their impacts and adaptations strategies taken up by farmers in different reaches. © EM International.","Adaption strategies; Climate change; Vaigai basin",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102340363

As a consequence of recurrent droughts in East and West Africa, integrated famine Early Warning Systems (EWS) have been established in order to produce and disseminate coherent and integrated information for prevention and management of food crises. Since the early 1990s, analysis tools and simulation models based on satellite meteorological data have been developed to support Multidisciplinary Working Groups (MWG) in cropping season monitoring. However, many of these tools are now obsolete from the IT perspective or ineffective due to unavailability of regularly updated meteorological data. To ensure a long-term sustainability of operational systems for drought risk zones identification CNR-IBIMET has developed 4Crop, a coherent Open Source web-based Spatial Data Infrastructure to treat all input and output data in an interoperable, platform-independent and uniform way. The 4Crop system has been conceived as a multipurpose tool in order to provide different categories of stakeholder, from farmers to policy makers, with effective and useful information for climate risk reduction and drought resilience improvement. Advice to farmers is a fundamental component of prevention that can allow a better adaptation of traditional cropping systems to climatic variability. Past experiences show that agro-meteorological information and weather forecasts can play a key role for food security, reducing the vulnerability of farmers, strengthening rural production systems and increasing crop yields. A participatory and cross-disciplinary approach is essential to build farmers’ trust and to develop effective integration between scientific and local knowledge to increase the rate of dissemination and utilization of advice. © 2017, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Drought; Early warning systems; Risk management","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Drought; Food supply; Interoperability; Risk management; Weather forecasting; Adaptation; Cross-disciplinary approaches; Early Warning System; Integrated informations; Long-term sustainability; Meteorological information; Spatial data infrastructure; Traditional techniques; Information management",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022342773

Drum dryers are used to dry sawdust used for pellet production. It is important to look at the efficiency of the drying process and the problems caused by human factor. A method of automatic drum dryer implementation is offered in the paper. However, CHP have proved to be more efficient for pellet production with reduced CO2 emissions when compared to drum dryers. CHP can be divided, based on consumer type as CHP in central heating system and industrial CHP. The former provides thermal energy for consumers in cities, and the latter provides it for local factories and industrial groups. There is a drop in thermal energy consumption over the summer, giving an opportunity to use the remaining thermal energy for cooling needs.

Agriculture and land use contribute between 20 and 25 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement's aim to keep the average global temperature rise between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius implies that drastic emission cuts from agriculture are needed. The sequestration potential of agriculture and land use offers an important mechanism to achieve a transition to net-zero carbon emissions worldwide. So far, however, states have been reluctant to address emissions from, and sequestration by, the agricultural sector. Some states that have or are setting up a domestic emission-trading scheme allow for the generation of offsets in agriculture, but only to a limited extent. Australia is the only country that has a rather broad set of methodologies in place to award credits to farmers for all kinds of carbon-farming projects. This article reviews the experience with the Australian model so far, with the objective of articulating transferable lessons for regulatory design aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. It finds that it is possible to regulate for the reduction of emissions from agriculture and for increased sequestration in agricultural soils and in vegetation on agricultural lands, provided that certain conditions are met. Regulation must focus on individual projects at farms, based on a long-term policy that has a wider focus than just emission reduction. Such projects must comply with climate-smart methodologies that ensure the delivery of real, additional, measurable, and verifiable emission reductions and also foster long-term innovation and create economic, social, and environmental cobenefits. Moreover, a robust and reliable mrv system must be put in place. © KONINKLIJKE BRILL NV, LEIDEN, 2017.","Carbon farming; Carbon offsets; Carbon sequestration; Climate-smart agriculture; Emission trading; Emissions from agriculture; Paris agreement; Soil carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010295307

In previous publications, we described a rigorous workflow (step-by-step procedure) to accurately predict carbonate and sulphide scaling profiles from reservoir to separator using commonly available field data (Verri et al., 2017a). Although the workflow we describe is rigorous, the numerical results produced are of course subject to errors of different types. In the present paper we identify and describe three key categories of data and procedures that must be correctly gathered and used in order to obtain accurate carbonate and sulphide scale predictions: these relate to field measurements, data handling procedures, choice of software, model equations and parameters. Moreover, in this work we estimate the impact of unreliable field measurements on the final carbonate and sulphide scaling profiles, with particular focus on gas and water chemistry errors. By varying important parameters such as gas phase CO2 and H2S concentration, water pH and alkalinity, Ca2+ and Fe2+ levels, we assess the impact that errors in these measurements could have on the final scale prediction profiles. This work presents a comprehensive and systematic description of the common errors and challenges associated with the prediction of pH dependent scales (CaCO3, FeS, FeCO3). Moreover, the impact of various parameters on the final scale prediction results is established to distinguish between critical and non-critical data input in PVT and scale prediction software. The results from our analysis suggest that field measurement errors may not play a big role in high scaling risk scenarios, but that they are moreimportant in low/medium scaling systems. In addition, our calculations demonstrate the impact of increasing H2S on calcium carbonate scaling profile, which has not been previously addressed in the literature.",,"Alkalinity; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Computer software selection and evaluation; Forecasting; Iron compounds; Materials handling; Parameter estimation; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sulfur compounds; Systematic errors; Calcium carbonate scaling; Field measurement; In-situ concentrations; Numerical results; Reactive species; Scale prediction; Software selection; Step by step procedure; Data handling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088404276

The common approach to sulphide and carbonate scale prediction often does not account for three phase CO2 and H2S partitioning at different temperatures and pressures along the system. This leads to the use of inaccurate compositions and pH values for the mineral scaling calculations. In this paper, we apply a rigorous workflow (step-by-step procedure) based on a compositional PVT model to calculate molecular CO2 and H2S distribution, three phase relative volume changes, compositional changes and scale precipitation trends from the reservoir to the wellhead separation stage using commonly available surface field data, a full PVT software and a scale prediction software of user's choice. A simplified version of the workflow was previously applied to high CO2 and H2S gas/condensate wells with production of condensed water only (Verri et al., 2016). This paper focuses on the field application of our general workflow to North Sea oil wells with high water cut and medium H2S levels (2200 ppmv in the separator gas phase). By following this rigorous procedure and applying the concept of Maximum Dissolved Iron (MDI) we were able to provide accurate sulphide and carbonate scale prediction profiles from reservoir to separator. The combination of reservoir, production and chemical engineering models using specific iterative processes (within the workflow) has provided a new and reliable step-by-step procedure for the prediction of combined sulphide and carbonate scales in oil and gas wells which can be implemented by anyone using any PVT and scale prediction software. However, in our ongoing work, we are building a model which incorporates all of this workflow by coupling together PVT/VLE models with our aqueous scale prediction software.

Measurements are made using 12.7-micron-sized thermocouples characterized by a relatively small response time (≈1 [ms]).

Emissions are built from a baseline scenario, which takes in account cement production, quarrying, transportation of raw materials and finished products, material storage and the differentiated behavior of emission sources according to systems of control. The comparing of the model results with air quality measured levels for each process and evaluated source, allows an analysis of contributions as a guide to determine and prioritize what process needs interventions or not.

Understanding how these innovations are actually realized, and hence how they can be promoted by public and private partners, is still limited. Particularly, initiating resource partnerships for waste-to-resource innovations in the absence of a government-funded facilitator, such as previously the National Industrial Symbiosis Programme (NISP) in the UK, has remained underexplored. This paper explores how companies identify potential resource partners in terms of network and geographical distances. Based on case studies of waste-to-resource innovation in the Humber region of the UK, the paper concludes that (1) companies can identify resource partners among/through their direct contacts that are involved in resource production/management themselves; and (2) that about 73% of these connections are located within a 75 miles’ radius. Furthermore, various new ‘facilitators’ were identified, demonstrating the need for a refined government approach to facilitate industrial symbiosis as part of the wider transition towards the circular economy. © 2017 The Author(s).

Such an installation is already in service since the opening of the Disney Shanghai in order to provide full electricity and hot water needs to the resort. And if such a system works efficiently for Disney resort, it can be imagined that in a near future CCHP can be used for residential areas, and thus reducing the operation of coal power plants.

The diesel cycle shows a superior thermal efficiency compared to the spark ignition (SI) combustion. Unlike SI engines a complete (100%) replacement of liquid fuel with gaseous fuel, containing less carbon, such as natural gas, is not possible for compression ignition (CI) engines. Since resistance of methane to auto-ignition is high, it is necessary to use another fuel with higher reactivity for ignition. Therefore a partial substitution of diesel fuel with low-carbon fuel seems to be a meaningful approach to a step reduction of CO2 emissions. One option is a dual-fuel operation of the diesel engine. As of today, the majority of dual-fuel (DF) engines research and development activities are focused on large cylinder bore and heavy duty engines operated with lean mixtures, several previous works describe the evaluation of DF principle in the light duty engines operating in lean and stoichiometric region. The goal of this work is to identify the potentially interesting regions for practical use of the DF combustion in a broad area of loads, NG substitution ratios, boost level and speed, on a diesel engine of the cylinder size and structure compatible with engines for passenger cars and vans. The work was performed on a single cylinder engine and the tests were focused on engine performance, efficiency, gaseous emissions and particulate matter.

Several operating parameters, the configuration, environmental conditions and microbiological diversity of the biological processes affect significantly nitrous oxide (N2O) formation in WWTPs. However there are still uncertainties regarding the exact triggering mechanisms and the dependancies between the N2O emissions and main performance parameters of the plant. The aim of this work is to apply an event-based sensitivity analysis (EventTracker) to investigate dependencies and potential patterns between the operating parameters monitored online in wastewater treatment processes and N2O emissions. The complete dataset from long-term N2O monitoring in a full-scale plug-flow and two Carrousel reactors published by Daelman et al. (2015) was used for the analysis. The event-based sensitivity analysis indicated significant dependencies between the system parameters (i.e. nitrite, nitrate, ammonia) and N2O emissions. Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient was applied using monthly datasets indicating significant correlations between nitrite and nitrate sensor signals with the N2O emissions. The latter was mainly observed in cases characterised by high N2O emission fluxes supporting the event-based sensitivity analysis. The examined method enabled the grouping of the system parameters based on the identified dependencies. The results indicated that N2O emissions can provide information for the state of the examined biological processes. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Full-scale WWTPs; N2O emissions; Real-time control; Sensitivity analysis","Ammonia; Nitrates; Nitrogen oxides; Real time control; Wastewater treatment; Environmental conditions; Full-scale WWTPs; Operating parameters; Performance parameters; Rank correlation coefficient; Triggering mechanism; Wastewater treatment plants; Wastewater treatment process; Sensitivity analysis",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060245878

The SDA is a methodological tool that can be used to study and manage complex and dynamic systems characterized by feedback mechanisms, which can be relevantly influenced by the policy&decision-making process and its delays. The SDA may help to define, implement and evaluate decision makers choices from the output of systems to stimulations from the outside. Scientific literature provides important experiences in the field of these simulation models, both for the development of ecological agriculture and for the simulation of the impacts of policy scenarios in a certain region/area. Conservation Agriculture (CA) is a farming system, mainly for arable crops, which helps to achieve goals of sustainable and profitable agriculture. It is currently playing an ever-increasing role in the frame of EU agricultural policies in consideration of the positive impacts it can produce, in terms of sustainable use of natural resources as well as of Climate Change mitigation and adaptation. At farm level, moreover, CA represents a way to combine environmental and sustainability concerns with profitability and competitiveness aspects, in a variety of agroecological zones and farming conditions. Short-term solutions and immediate benefits always attract farmers more than long-term ones. Unfortunately, the full technical, environmental and economic advantages provided by the adoption of CA can be measured and appreciated by farmers only in the medium and long-term, when its principles (minimum soil disturbance, permanent soil cover crop rotation) are well established within the farming system. This evidence, together with other technical, social and cultural forces, relevantly affects the process of CA adoption at farm level as well as the effectiveness of agricultural policy efforts aiming at this result. The aim of this study is to validate a Systemic Dynamic Model (SDM) to be used in ex-ante evaluation to address the public action towards the effective achievement of the planned result of supporting the adoption of CA techniques in a certain region. It seeks answers to strategic questions related to the elements that could influence the effectiveness of the support payment schemes programmed into the sub-measure 10.1 of 2014-2020 Sicily Rural Development Programme (SRDP). The SDA considers relevant variables which affect the application and dissemination of CA techniques among potential beneficiaries whose number is estimated based on sub-measure access conditions and restrictions. For this purpose, the model structure is based on environmental, social and economic issues, e.g. physical and economic farm dimensions, provision of machinery hire, advisory services, reduction of production costs, etc. Results show that in a long term dynamic context the environmental support payment scheme provided by Measure 10 does not represent the only driving force in the system to guide farmers towards the expected shift from conventional to CA agriculture. What is needed is a deeper integration with other policies (innovation policies) and other interventions, e.g. schemes promoting precision farming, collective investments, advice, training and information Copyright © 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Climate change; Crops; Decision making; Dynamics; Machinery; Profitability; Regional planning; Soils; Sustainable development; System theory; Agricultural policies; Climate change mitigation; Conservation agricultures; Decision making process; Ecological agricultures; Environmental supports; System dynamics approach; System dynamics model; Agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026399859

This presentation will explore that question with particular emphasis on several recent developments occurring in December 2015 that will directly affect the answers to that question in the context of the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) regulatory scheme for controlling greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. In 2015 EPA finalized a foundational regulatory framework for controlling GHG emissions from both new and existing fossil-fuelled electric utility generating units. In doing so, EPA conditioned the use of CCS on quantifying stored carbon dioxide through reporting under subpart RR of the part 98 GHG reporting requirements, the reporting approach developed primarily for geological sequestration in saline formations. And subpart RR reporting would be required regardless of whether carbon dioxide storage is achieved through geologic sequestration or in association with carbon dioxide enhanced oil recovery (CO2-EOR). Numerous concerns were raised in comments on the proposed rules and in response to the final rules about the ability for EOR operations to comply with the reporting requirements of subpart RR, and from 2010 until 2015 no one reported under subpart RR because all of the projects injecting carbon dioxide into saline formations had qualified for research exemptions, and no EOR operations had voluntarily opted to report under subpart RR rather than under subparts W and UU. As 2015 came to a close, efforts were launched to get EPA to show that the hurdles to quantifying and reporting for carbon dioxide stored in association with CO2 EOR can be surmounted or to remove those hurdles. On December 22, 2015 EPA approved the first ever use of subpart RR reporting for a CO2-EOR operation by approving a monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) plan submitted by Occidental Petroleum for the Denver Unit in the Permian Basin of West Texas. In so doing, EPA provided some clarity about how a number of concerns and uncertainties surrounding the use of subpart RR reporting for storage associated with CO2-EOR, and the decision indicates significant flexibility to adapt parts of subpart RR requirements to a substantially different context than saline formation geologic storage. Yet other questions that have been raised remain unanswered in any direct way. And these uncertainties may bar the way to effective implementation of EPA's requirements for existing electric utility generating units. EPA is being called upon to show how the reporting can be achieved without disrupting the EOR operations through clarifications, guidance, policy revisions, or decisions or, alternatively, to remove the hurdles through regulatory actions. This presentation will explain the significant developments in reporting and in regulatory petitions that occurred at the end of 2015 and assess how this affects the viability of CCUS that relies on storage associated with CO2-EOR. It will also survey the potential effects of other developments in the implementation of other CO2 storage quantification and reporting regimes at the subnational, national and international levels in comparison with the requirements being implemented by EPA at the federal level.

Grapevines are highly sensitive to climatic conditions. Hence, plant development, grape ripening and grape composition at ripeness are modified by climate change. Some of these changes are already visible and will be amplified over the coming decades; other effects, although not yet measurable, can be predicted by modeling. The objective of this paper is to assess which modifications in wine quality and typicity can be expected and what levers growers can implement to adapt to this changing situation. Methods and results: This paper focusses on the effect of temperature, vine water status and UV-B radiation in viticulture. Vine phenology is driven by temperature. A significant advance in phenology (i.e. budburst, flowering and veraison dates) has been observed since the early 1980’s in most winegrowing regions. The combined effect of advanced phenology and increased temperatures results in warmer conditions during grape ripening. In these conditions, grapes contain more sugar and less organic acids. Composition in secondary metabolites, and in particular aromas and aroma precursors, is dramatically changed. Increased drought, because of lower summer rain and/or because of higher reference evapotranspiration (ET0), induces earlier shoot growth cessation, reduced berry size, increased content in skin phenolic compounds, lower malic acid concentrations and modified aroma and aroma precursor profiles. Increased UV-B radiation enhances the accumulation of skin phenolics and modifies aroma and aroma precursor profiles. Over the next decades, an amplification of these trends is highly likely. Major adaptations can be reached though modifications in plant material (grapevine varieties, clones and rootstocks), vineyard management techniques (grapevine architecture, canopy management, harvest dates, vineyard floor management, timing of harvest, irrigation) or site selection (altitude, aspect, soil water holding capacity). Conclusion: Climate change will induce changes in grape composition which will modify wine quality and typicity. However, these modifications can be limited through adaptations in the vineyard. Significance and impact of the study: This study assesses the impact of major climatic parameters (temperature, water and radiation) on vine physiology and grape ripening.

With this knowledge primary NOx and primary N2O can be reduced at low costs and in this way the costs for secondary measures are much reduced as well. In this paper, mathematical models regarding primary NOx of PFC, and primary NOx and primary N2O of CFBC are presented. The models are based on data from large-scale power stations. With CFBC the models hold for the fuels coal, lignite and wood only, and not for co-combustion. This paper presents a part of a much larger study regarding this subject. The models as developed are: PFC, NOx, eq. 2: NOx = (NOp + NOp x /l x N x FR) x Lambda CFBC, NOx, eq. 5: NOx = C2 x Lamba2 x N xexp(-3215/Temperature)/(FR+1)0.8 CBCF, N2O, eq. 6: N20 = C3 x Lambda4.4 x N x FR0.8 x exp(8100/Temperature) With N as N-content of the fuel in g/GJ (LHV), Lambda as the air to fuel ratio, FR as the fuel ratio, Temperature in K, NOx and NOp as NO2 in mg/Nm3 dry and at 6vol.% O2, N2O in mg/Nm3 dry and at 6vol.% O2, f1, C2 and C3 as constants, which depend on the furnace, and NOp as primary thermal NOx, which also depends on the furnace. Modelling of primary NOx with PFC and CFBC is not new. Modelling of primary N2O with CFBC is not new. With increasing temperature, primary N2O reduces. With PFC, primary NOx is about formation only. With CFBC, primary NOx and primary N2O are about formation and reduction. From a qualitative point of view, the mathematical models of primary NOx are useful, both with PFC and CFBC. From a quantitative point of view, the models of primary NOx with CFBC and PFC, and N2O with CFBC, are not satisfactory. They hold for a specific boiler only. Primary emissions of NOx and N2O of CFBC also depend on air staging, catalytic activity of the ash and/or bed material, the bed inventory, “limestone addition”, cyclone separation efficiency, flue gas residence time, etcetera, which are not (yet) modelled. In this paper attention is paid to the CFBC design parameters cyclone separation efficiency, limestone addition and the height of the secondary air ports above the bottom, and their influence on primary NOx and -N2O. These design parameters easily explain for the variations of primary NOx and primary N2O emissions encountered and modelled. The presence of catalytically active elements, like Na, K, Fe, Mg and Ca, in the fuel, the ash and the bed material must be considered as well, which is often not the case in literature. For instance wood is usually rich in K and Ca, and lignite can be rich in Ca. This also means: where there are rules, there are exceptions as well. The addition of limestone to the bed can increase primary NOx drastically, depending on the fuel, and hence in such cases limestone addition is definitely a bad idea. There is room for further research regarding both mathematical- and CFD modelling of primary NOx and -N2O with CFBC, amongst others regarding the effect of increasing Lambda on primary N2O and its cause, the presence of thermal NOx or not, co-combustion and other “fuels”, like pet cokes and dried municipal sewage sludge.",,"Catalyst activity; Coal combustion; Cost reduction; Cyclone separators; Efficiency; Emission control; Fluidized bed combustion; Fluidized beds; Fuels; Gas emissions; Lignite; Lime; Limestone; Nitrogen oxides; Sewage sludge; Waste incineration; Wood fuels; Air to fuel ratios; Circulating fluidised bed; Design parameters; Gas residence time; Increasing temperatures; Municipal sewage sludge; Primary emissions; Separation efficiency; Fluidized bed combustors",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052331147

National emissions were projected for the period 2010-2040, using Kaya factors, and there were assessments of a range of options to mitigate emissions through a cost-effectiveness analysis. A marginal abatement cost curve (MACC) was generated, identifying potential mitigation of 290 million tons accumulated up to 2040. An estimate was made of the uncertainty associated with the input parameters for the model mentioned. The statistical properties were estimated based on technical and scientific literature and the IPCC recommendations. The intention was to identify the stochastic condition of the initially deterministic model.

As a result, Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (or PHEVs) are receiving never before seen increased attention. Consequently, large-scale penetration of PHEVs into the market is expected to take place in the near future, however, an unattended increase in the PHEVs needs may cause several technical problems which could potentially compromise the stability of power systems. As a result of the growing necessity for addressing such issues, topics related to the optimization of PHEVs' charging infrastructures have captured the attention of many researchers. Related to this, several state-of-the-art swarm optimization methods (such as the well-known Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) or the recently proposed Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA) approach) have been successfully applied in the optimization of the average State of Charge (SoC), which represents one of the most important performance indicators in the context of PHEVs' intelligent power allocation. Many of these swarm optimization methods, however, are known to be subject to several critical flaws, including premature convergence and a lack of balance between the exploration and exploitation of solutions. Such problems are usually related to the evolutionary operators employed by each of the methods on the exploration and exploitation of new solutions. In this paper, the recently proposed States of Matter Search (SMS) swarm optimization method is proposed for maximizing the average State of Charge of PHEVs within a charging station. In our experiments, several different scenarios consisting on different numbers of PHEVs were considered. To test the feasibility of the proposed approach, comparative experiments were performed against other popular PHEVs' State of Charge maximization approaches based on swarm optimization methods. The results obtained on our experimental setup show that the proposed SMS-based SoC maximization approach has an outstanding performance in comparison to that of the other compared methods, and as such, proves to be superior for tackling the challenging problem of PHEVs' smart charging. © 2017 by the authors.","Gravitational search (GSA); Intelligent management; Nature-inspired; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEV); Smart grid; State of matter search (SMS)","Battery management systems; Electric power transmission networks; Gravitation; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Petroleum transportation; Problem solving; Vehicle-to-grid; Gravitational search (GSA); Intelligent management; Nature-inspired; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Smart grid; State of matter search (SMS); Plug-in hybrid vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025162528

Our approach consists in deriving minimum cost solutions for achieving progressive emission reductions up to 2050 using the North American TIMES Energy Model (NATEM), a detailed multi-regional and integrated optimization energy model. With this model, we analyze a baseline and two 60% reduction scenarios of combustion related emissions by 2050 from 1990 levels, with different assumptions regarding projected demands for energy services and availability of technology options for carbon mitigation. The first reduction scenario includes only well-known technologies while the second one considers additional disruptive technologies, which are known but are not fully developed commercially. Results show that three fundamental transformations need to occur simultaneously in order to achieve ambitious GHG emission reduction targets: electrification of end-use sectors, decarbonization of electricity generating supply, and efficiency improvements. In particular, our results show that electricity represents between 52% and 57% of final energy consumption by 2050, electricity generating supply achieves nearly complete decarbonization by 2025 and final energy consumption decreases by 20% relative to the baseline by 2050. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Canadian energy systems; Decarbonization pathways; GHG emissions; Optimization; TIMES model","Electric power generation; Emission control; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Optimization; Disruptive technology; Efficiency improvement; Energy systems; GHG emission; Global mean surface temperature; Integrated optimization; Progressive emissions; TIMES modeling; Decarbonization; combustion; electricity generation; electrification; emission control; greenhouse gas; numerical model; optimization; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016400488

Its aim is to better prepare communities and staff to cope with small and severe, slow and rapid onset disasters. This paper analyses the impacts of this proactive networking process in Vanuatu on the effectiveness of management of Cyclone Pam (March 2015). It highlights the main strengths of the governance system in place to prepare for the occurrence and response of Cyclone Pam, and to conduct timely and coordinated operations, while pursuing Climate Change Adaptation and Sustainable Development activities during the response and early recovery phases. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Integrated disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation; Networked governance; Resilience-building; Vanuatu",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071362566

Metals average concentration (ppm) in PMS and AGO samples were as follows: 1.1, 1.43; Iron 4.78, 10.10; copper 0.39, 0.19; zinc 10.5, 17.43; chromium 2.4, 3.83; magnesium 0.633, 0.60 and calcium 135.39, 128.06. Results showed that copper and magnesium were the least concentrated while calcium has the highest concentration. SLO was recycled using locally sourced soap (surfactant) and tetraoxo sulphate (VI) acid, H2SO4, producing cleaner SLO suitable for combustion in industrial burner. Recycled SLO was found to have a specific gravity of 0.8972, water content of 10%wt, carbon residue of 3.89% and a flash point of 127°C which complied with standard properties given in the literature.

We argue that an area-based approach allows more houses to be targeted in places where local area characteristics show inefficient elements, and may therefore potentially capture a greater number of households per unit of cost, compared to the existing self-referral methods. We propose a spatial method to show the extent of building envelopes, heating systems and temperature controls. Heating controls, which are not recorded in the United Kingdom Homes Energy Efficiency Database (HEED), but we believe would be considered good practice to maintain balanced temperatures around the house, and also potentially reduce the complexity in modelling the thermal zones. Additionally, heating controls are seen as compulsory in new building regulations, an eligible measure in Green Deal and Energy Company Obligations, and in the United Kingdom Department of Energy and Climate Change (DECC) heat strategy.

The plant is an organic Rankine cycle cogeneration facility located in mainland Spain. All the villages over 15.000 inhabitants have been considered as potential locations. Partial load operation is considered as well as cogeneration (CHP) and trigeneration (CCHP) schemes. Biomass calculations were performed using BIORAISE (a free GIS tool) showing that, in all the locations, the available biomass within a 30-km radius is larger than the demand, with an average cost of 10 €/MWh. No subsidies have been considered. In CHP operation, all the locations lead to “high efficiency cogeneration” plants, with the best profitability in medium-severe to severe-winter climate zones. In CCHP mode, only locations in medium-to severe-winter climate zones reach “high efficiency”. This mode is worthwhile in climate zones with mild winters and medium to hot summers.

Traditionally, large heat rejection systems use cooling towers or evaporative coolers in order to reduce the heat rejection equipment size as well as the overall energy consumption due to lower condensing temperatures. However, the water based corrosion, maintenance and health risks such as Legionella disease moved the industry towards less efficient dry heat rejection systems. During peak high ambient periods, by simply intermittently spraying water over a wired mesh area in front of the heat rejection surface against the direction of the air stream, the wet bulb temperature can be reduced. Therefore, the adiabatic cooling process can be introduced using simple city mains water sprayed into an air stream which rapidly evaporates and the hidden energy of water provides a cooler down stream air temperature as much as 10~25◦C (20~30◦F) lower than the incoming air. A lower air on temperature results in lower condensing temperature and therefore saves as much as 30% peak power consumption by simply using water directly from the mains tap. The majority of the time the water pressure remains within the sealed main water pipe and is based on a Total Waste principle. Hence, the health risk involved with a standing water reservoir as well as expensive chemical treatment requirements can be completely eliminated. Test sites of this new concept indicated between 20~35% peak electricity reduction for Air Cooled Chillers and Condensers. This concept can be considered as a simple DIY kit for both New and Retrofit applications. Hence, the potential for the energy saving and Carbon Emission reduction for the industry as a whole is significant and this can be achieved by simply using existing mains tap water infrastructure. © Indoor Environment for Hot Climates - ASHRAE, HotClimates 2017.All Rights Reserved.",,"Corrosion; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Evaporative cooling systems; Health risks; Heat sinks; Reservoirs (water); Water pipelines; Air-cooled condensers; Air-cooled heat rejection systems; Carbon emission reductions; Chemical treatments; Condensing temperature; Dry bulb temperature; Heat rejection systems; Wet bulb temperature; Rivers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093921647

Air quality simulations by using WRF-CMAQ model were conducted in the year 2014 over the horizontal domains covering Northeast Asia including the mainland of Japan. In the baseline simulation (Base) case, emissions from field BB were derived from FINN v1.5 in the year 2014. The model approximately captured the daily mean PM2.5 mass concentrations except for underestimates in autumn around Northeast China where the irregular field BB following the harvest in autumn could frequently occur. In order to clarify the underestimation of the emission from BB sources in China, the other simulation with five times boosted BB sources (FINN05) was conducted in addition to Base case. The model performance was significantly improved in FINN05 with smaller biases and higher indices of agreement between simulated and observed values, compared to those of Base. In order to evaluate long-range transport of PM2.5 from BB sources in China towards Japan, we compared CMAQ/BFM-estimated BB contributions both in Base and FINN05 cases with PMF-estimated BB contributions at Noto peninsula in Japan (Ikemori et al., 2017). The CMAQ/BFM-estimated contributions of FINN05 better harmonized with the PMF-estimated contributions.

The New South Wales (NSW) government in Australia has introduced mandatory energy efficiency/ GHG emissions reduction target through the Building Sustainability Index (BASIX) assessment tool, which estimates the operational energy consumption and GHG emissions from new residential developments based on information available at the building design stage. However, post-occupancy energy consumption can be different from the estimated figures at the design stage. This research aims to disentangle the relationships between various attributes that influence energy consumption at the dwelling scale through a post-occupancy residential energy performance analysis model. The model combines multidimensional attributes which include building design features, construction quality, possession of household appliances and their usage, demographic and homeowners' energy use behaviour. The model allows comparing the estimated energy consumption/ GHG emissions from BASIX assessment with actual energy consumption/ GHG emissions in the real household environment. Data for this study has been collected from a sample of 48 BASIX affected dwellings located in the greater Sydney area which includes energy bill data, real-time monitoring of electricity consumption and indoor environment (temperature and humidity) data. This paper reports findings based on the data collected from late 2015 to mid-2016 from 16 dwellings. The initial results demonstrate discrepancies in energy consumption (therefore GHG emissions), household occupancy and breakdown of energy consumption for various services between BASIX estimates and the collected data. Given that BASIX assessment is based on information available at the design stage, the reported discrepancies are expected. More importantly, the initial results show that BASIX assessments under-estimated energy consumption for active cooling and over-estimated consumption for lighting and ventilation and other household plug loads. © 2017 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","BASIX; GHG emissions; household energy; Post-occupancy energy performance","Architectural design; Domestic appliances; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Housing; Structural design; Sustainable development; Buildings; Energy efficiency; BASIX; Electricity-consumption; Energy performance; GHG emission; Household energy; Multidimensional attributes; Residential development; Temperature and humidities; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020545364

The use of Ostrom's Institutional Analysis and Development and social-ecological systems frameworks are effective means in guiding the formation and operation of institutions in managing common pool resources. Community participation and cooperative governance of community pool resources (CPRs) motivate individuals to solve common problems to enhance their own productivity and gain a major part of their economic return from the CPRs. Good governance and the effective benefit-sharing mechanism of the CPRs will provide a conducive environment for the implementation of Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in the region. Community-based natural resource management (CBNRM) is a distinct way of managing environmental challenges. Community-based solutions to environmental issues often depend on socioenvironmental benefits, creating collective actions in response to environmental issues, absorbing risks, and creating safety nets for the vulnerable members of the community. However, there are several issues associated with CBNRM that are largely ignored by the current environmental and resource management policy approaches. There is a stronger need to overcome issues related to CBNRM to facilitate effective management of the CPRs. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

Turkey, with its increasing greenhouse area, is one of the representative countries of the region. Thanks to the mild winter climatic conditions, cultivation of vegetables under simple structures is possible. However, due to the changing concerns and demands on product quality and increasing competition in the market, there is a need to increase productivity. The aim of this study was to evaluate and suggest practical and economic improvements of both greenhouse structure and management, for both low tech and high tech greenhouses, in two different climatic zones of Turkey. Locally collected data were used to validate an existing greenhouse design tool, to predict greenhouse climate and tomato yield at given local climate conditions. Thereafter, alternative greenhouse designs and climate control strategies were simulated and evaluated. The results show that ventilation area should be at least 17% in all cases if insect net is not used. Among active climate management means: heating is worthwhile and temperature should not be less than 15oC for high tech greenhouses and CO2 enrichment (albeit with a limited capacity) should be considered. It can be concluded that such a combined climate-yield model, by quantifying the effect on yield of greenhouse improvements, can be used as an analysis tool for estimating the profitability of an investment. © 2017, World Food Ltd. and WFL Publishers.

According to draft of energy policy such state will be maintained at least until year 2050. Therefore it is necessary to carry out researches and take actions in order to limit emission of harmful products associated with production and utilization of this mineral. Nowadays, pro-ecological activities, mainly focus on development and application of technology the purest processing of coal into thermal and electrical energy. However less attention is devoted to limitation of harmful gases emission during exploitation process of this material. During the coal mining process, a lot of different harmful gases are released into the mining atmosphere. The most unfavorable of them is methane. This gas is side product accompanying hard coal exploitation and next to carbon dioxide has the greatest impact on global greenhouse effect. In recent years, due to the exploitation of seams with large amount of methane remaining at progressively deeper levels, a significant growth of its emission takes place. Part of this methane is captured by the methane drainage installations and used in economic purposes. Unfortunately, a significant part of this emission goes into the atmosphere and natural environment. In the paper, results of analysis aimed to determine amount of methane emitted into the atmosphere through hard coal mines in Poland in the years 2011-2016 are presented. Thanks to applied taxonomic methods, classification of mines based on amount of emitted methane into the atmosphere in this period was performed. Detailed analysis was performed using one of the non-hierarchical clustering methods, which is the k-means method. Application of this method enabled to isolate homogenous subsets of analyzed objects (mines) for which as measure of similarity the Euclidean distance was assumed. In the analysis six variables describing each of mines were taken into account. Mines were grouped into clusters according to the similarity scale. As a basic criterion the total emission of methane into the atmosphere and the emission per ton of extracted coal were assumed. Obtained data clearly indicate mines (objects) which in particular way contribute to worsening the state of atmosphere. Simultaneously, they are a significant information for the emergency services responsible for limitation of harmful emission of greenhouse gases and improvement of environment state. Obtained data could also be the basis for undertaking the practical actions, in order to reduce the harmful emission of methane into the atmosphere. © SGEM2017 All rights reserved.","Cluster analysis; Coal mines; K-means method; Methane emissions","Anthracite; Carbon dioxide; Cluster analysis; Coal industry; Emergency services; Greenhouse effect; Greenhouse gases; Hierarchical clustering; K-means clustering; Methane; Development and applications; Environment state; Euclidean distance; Hierarchical clustering methods; K-means method; Measure of similarities; Methane emissions; Natural environments; Coal mines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047093716

The most endangered region by this hazard, during ventilation of longwall in „U from boundaries” system is the crossing with ventilation roadway (so called “upper corner of longwall”). Accumulation of methane in this place results from its release from goaf. Therefore, in order to decrease methane concentration in this region, auxiliary ventilation devices are used. They are aimed to supply to this place such an amount of fresh air, as to dilute the dangerous concentration of methane. This process is called reblowing, and is aimed to ventilate top corner of the wall. In the paper results of numerical studies of distribution of methane concentration in hazardous zone (upper corner of longwall) are presented. Modeling studies were carried out basing on the real data from mined hard coal seam. Within the scope of performed analysis three ventilation cases were considered and compared. First case, in which auxiliary ventilation device was not used. Second one, in which only auxiliary device was used, and third case in which auxiliary ventilation device and ventilation baffle were used.

The configuration assessed is based on a two-membrane system: a CO2 capture membrane that separates the CO2 for final sequestration and a CO2 recycle membrane that selectively recycles CO2 to the gas turbine compressor inlet in order to increase the CO2 concentration in the gas turbine flue gas. Three different membrane technologies with different permeability and selectivity have been investigated. The mass and energy balances are calculated by integrating a power plant model, a membrane model and a CO2 purification unit model. An economic model is then used to estimate the cost of electricity and of CO2 avoided. A sensitivity analysis on the main process parameters and economic assumptions is also performed. It was found that a combination of a high permeability membrane with moderate selectivity as a recycle membrane and a very high selectivity membrane with high permeability used for the capture membrane resulted in the lowest CO2 avoided cost of 75 US$/tCO2. This plant features a feed pressure of 1.5 bar and a permeate pressure of 0.2 bar for the capture membrane. This result suggests that membrane systems can be competitive for CO2 capture from NGCC power plants when compared with MEA absorption. However, to achieve significant advantages with respect to benchmark MEA capture, better membrane permeability and lower costs are needed with respect to the state of the art technology. In addition, due to the selective recycle, the gas turbine operates with a working fluid highly enriched with CO2. This requires redesigning gas turbine components, which may represent a major challenge for commercial deployment. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture; CCS; CO2 membranes; Combined cycle; Economic analysis","Carbon; Carbon capture; Compressibility of gases; Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economic analysis; Gas compressors; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Gases; Membrane technology; Membranes; Natural gas; Recycling; Sensitivity analysis; Combined cycle; Gas turbine compressors; Mass and energy balance; Membrane permeability; Natural gas combined cycles; Natural gas fired combined cycle; State-of-the-art technology; Techno-Economic analysis; Carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; concentration (composition); economic analysis; membrane; natural gas; permeability; power plant; turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017516541

According to the state-of-the-art regional fire risk projections, in forthcoming decades climate effects are expected to become stronger and possibly overcome fire prevention efforts. However, significant uncertainties exist and the direct effect of climate change in regulating fuel moisture (e.g. warmer conditions increasing fuel dryness) could be counterbalanced by the indirect effects on fuel structure (e.g. warmer conditions limiting fuel amount), affecting the transition between climate-driven and fuel-limited fire regimes as temperatures increase. Here we analyse and model the impact of coincident drought and antecedent wet conditions (proxy for the climatic factor influencing total fuel and fine fuel structure) on the summer Burned Area (BA) across all eco-regions in Mediterranean Europe. This approach allows BA to be linked to the key drivers of fire in the region. We show a statistically significant relationship between fire and same-summer droughts in most regions, while antecedent climate conditions play a relatively minor role, except in few specific eco-regions. The presented models for individual eco-regions provide insights on the impacts of climate variability on BA, and appear to be promising for developing a seasonal forecast system supporting fire management strategies. © The Author(s) 2017.",,"climate change; driver; drought; Europe; fire; human; summer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029174354

For this, the most sought after tools are the energy modeling software packages which help in taking necessary energy-related decisions that could possibly reduce the energy consumption. While most of the algorithms used by these tools show realistic results on par with the actual building performance, the accuracy still lacks.

This paper aims to examine climate change adaptation strategies of farmers in the dry zone region. Farmers’ choice for adaptation strategies is influenced by many factors such as the practical availability and by socioeconomic conditions of the farmers. They are moreover influenced by the perception about climate change and by the specific problems prevailing in the farming systems. Design/methodology/approach: This research is carried out in Magwe district in the dry zone region of Myanmar using a random selection of 212 farmers from three Townships (Magwe, Yenanchaung and Chauk). A multinomial logistic regression (MLR) was applied to assess the factors affecting the choice by farmers for adaptation strategies. Findings: The study found that in the past, farmers used to apply locally available indigenous climate change adaptation strategies. However, recently, most farmers seem to have shifted to introduced adaptation strategies. The most popular adaptation strategy is to adjust the planting dates and sowing method (56.1 per cent). Furthermore, farmers identified a number of barriers that limit the adoption of adaptation methods. Risk is found to be an important driver of crop diversification. Finally, the MLR model showed that information from radio, access to seeds and extension services affect the choice of adaptation strategies. Originality/value: The study shows that adoption of locally available indigenous climate change adaptation methods is gradually decreasing, and there is a shift to introduced adaptation strategies. The study can assist public and private organizations to obtain insight in the determinants of climate change adaptation in the dry zone region of Myanmar. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Adoption determinants; Dry zone region of Myanmar; Indigenous climate change adaptation measures; Introduced adaptation strategies; Magwe district; Risk perception","agrometeorology; arid region; climate change; crop production; farmers knowledge; farming system; local adaptation; public-private partnership; risk perception; socioeconomic conditions; sowing date; Magway; Myanmar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007413733

This assumption is applied to all types of industrial and municipal WRRFs. Using radiocarbon dating we confirmed that a combination of biogenic and fossil carbon enter municipal WRRFs. In addition, we found that the fossil carbon content varies with the type of industrial wastewater. The fossil content from the petrochemical refinery and the pulp/paper mill wastewater treatment plants set the boundary for the fossil carbon, with one containing almost exclusively fossil carbon and the other almost no fossil carbon, respectively. We also compared the fossil carbon content at different points of the WRRF with their GHG potential, calculated as CO2 equivalent from ideal combustion. The results showed that secondary sludge had the highest CO2 equivalent emission potential of up to 0.294 kg fossil CO2 equivalent m-3 wastewater treated. Our calculations showed that sludge-generated biogas and biosolids had little potential to produce direct GHG emission, thus digesting secondary sludge instead of disposal may reduce the overall fossil GHG emission.

Well designed infrastructure and traffic controllers along with more efficient vehicles and policy measures are required to mitigate congestion and thus reduce transport emissions. In order to evaluate how changes in the traffic system affect energy use and emissions, traffic analysis tools are used together with emission models. In large urban areas emission models mainly rely on aggregated outputs from traffic models, such as the average link speed and flow. Static traffic models are commonly used to generate inputs for emission models, since they can efficiently be applied to larger areas with relatively low computational cost. However, in some cases their underlying assumptions can lead to inaccurate predictions of the traffic conditions and hence to unreliable emission estimates. The aim of this paper is to investigate and quantify the errors that static modeling introduces in emission estimation and subsequently considering the source of those errors, to suggest and evaluate possible solutions. The long analysis periods that are commonly used in static models, as well as the static models' inability to describe dynamic traffic flow phenomena can lead up to 40 % underestimation of the estimated emissions. In order to better estimate the total emissions, we propose the development of a post processing technique based on a quasi-dynamic approach, attempting to capture more of the excess emissions created by the temporal and spatial variations of traffic conditions © 2017 The Authors.

Floods pose a threat to human life and health and cause great property loss and irreversible changes to the natural environment. Studies concerning flood risk management have shown that seeking measures aimed at limiting the tragic consequences of floods are more effective than attempts to prevent them. The EU’s environmental policy takes into account climate change and the dramatic consequences to the social and economic development and to nature. Initiatives taken by the Council of Europe include, for example, passing the Water Framework Directive, which unifies legislative solutions implemented in member states with the aim of improving their effectiveness in controlling flood risks. Adopting the “EU strategy on adaptation to climate change”, which recommends taking measures aimed at reducing the risk of extreme weather phenomena, was another significant step. The aim of this publication is to show the role and importance of legal and financial instruments which support measures to reduce flood-related losses and the factors that affect their effectiveness. © SGEM2017.","Financial instruments; Flood protection; Law","Climate change; Deforestation; Economic and social effects; Environmental protection; Environmental regulations; Finance; Flood control; Health risks; Laws and legislation; Risk assessment; Risk management; Water conservation; Adaptation to climate changes; Environmental policy; Flood protection; Flood risk management; Natural environments; Rapid climate change; Social and economic development; Water Framework Directives; Floods",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063101055

Electricity planning, a crucial tool to optimally match future supply and demand, has largely focused on minimising costs in southern Africa, sometimes complemented by a discussion of a discrete set of environmental scenarios. Political objectives, although their significance is well documented, have been overlooked in Southern African Power Pool (SAPP) quantitative electrification planning research. This study created a novel geo-referenced, multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) model that combined continuous cost and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission minimisation objectives with the political goal of achieving national electricity self-sufficiency, yielding the optimal trade-offbetween these three objectives. It solved the MOLP for three different political risk scenarios in order to examine a further political objective. The results revealed a sharp monetary trade-offbetween CO2 emission reductions and national electricity sovereignty objectives in the SAPP. Furthermore, curtailing international political risks has significant consequences for trade and the optimal generation mix. While the optimal size of the frequently recommended Grand Inga dam in the Democratic Republic of Congo was considerably reduced when either national electricity sovereignty or political risk constraints were imposed on the model, solar energy shares increased significantly in both cases. This was the case especially when CO2 emissions were simultaneously curtailed. Increased technological, institutional and policy-making efforts to implement solar PV at scale would therefore imply immediate political and environmental merits for national governments in the SAPP, and present a sustainable development opportunity for the region.","Energy security; Grand Inga dam; Multi-criteria optimisation; Political risk analysis; Renewable energy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035775513

Three scenario (biomethane, bioethanol and pellet for improved biomass cookstove) have been compared for their energy economics and emission. It has been revealed that if paddy straw is not being burned, it can be effectively utilized for biomethanation and bioethanol production which can yield energy equivalent of 8.0 GJ/tonne and 5.6 GJ/tonne, respectively, while pelletized paddy straw can be used in improved biomass cookstoves to meet out thermal cooking energy requirement with reduced indoor air pollution. The analysis further revealed that biomethanation of paddy straw reduces net global warming potential by 2750 CO2e kg emissions/tonne. However, bioethanol production showed net global warming potential reduction of 2549 CO2e kg emissions/tonne.

PAH can also be detected at the exhaust of combustion systems, often associated to carbon particulate matter emissions. Due to their high toxicological potential the concentration levels of PAH detection should be very low (order of ppm) to meet the limits provided by the regulation on combustion emissions and atmosphere quality control. The PAH detection is mainly achieved by conventional, mainly chromatographic, analytical techniques applied to the fuel or to the organic carbon extracted from carbon particulate matter. Preliminary extraction, purification and pre-separation methods are the time-consuming methods necessary to isolate the PAH-rich mixtures from whichever organic matrix for further analysis with liquid or gas-chromatography. In this paper an alternative method based on the UV-Visible spectroscopic technique has been used for the qualification of PAH into the organic carbon associated to particulate matter sampled in fuel-rich sooting flames. In particular, a computing methodology able to solve nonlinearly constrained problems has been implemented on the UV-Visible absorption spectra of the organic material sampled in the soot-forming region of a laminar premixed rich ethylene-oxygen flame. The procedure allowed the good fitting of measured spectra with the spectra reconstructed by a suitable composition of PAH spectra. The methodology considers and evaluates the contribution of individual PAH which altogether better reproduces the fine structure overcoming the absorption background typically observed in the UV-Visible spectra of complex organic mixtures. © Copyright 2017, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,"Air purification; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Chromatography; Coal combustion; Combustion; Ethylene; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas chromatography; Hydrocarbon refining; Hydrocarbons; Liquid chromatography; Mixtures; Organic carbon; Quality control; Combustion emissions; Complex organic mixtures; Computing methodologies; Concentration levels; Constrained problem; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH); Spectroscopic technique; UV visible absorption spectrum; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021693623

In policy discourses, deforestation is often linked to'poor' and 'ethnic minority' households and their unsustainable practices such as the expansion of coffee production (and other agricultural activities) into forest areas. This paper applies a livelihood framework to discuss the links between livelihoods and land use amongst small-scale farmers in two communities. The findings of the livelihood survey demonstrate no clear linkages between poverty levels and unsustainable practices. In fact, the poorest segments were found to deforest the least. The ways in which current PES and REDD+ approaches are designed, do not provide appropriate solutions to address the underlying dimensions of issues at stake. The paper criticizes one-dimensional perspectives of the drivers behind deforestation and forest degradation often found in public policies and discourses. We suggest more comprehensive analyses of underlying factors encompassing the entire coffee production and land use system in this region. Addressing issues of land tenure and the scarcity of productive lands, and generating viable off-farm income alternatives seem to be crucial. Sustainable approaches for reducing deforestation and degradation could be possible through engaging with multiple stakeholders, including the business-oriented households in control of the coffee trade and of land transactions. © 2017 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.","Drivers of deforestation; Environmental policies; Livelihoods; PES; REDD+; Vietnam","Agriculture; Deforestation; Forestry; Land use; Polyethylenes; Public policy; Agricultural activities; Comprehensive analysis; Environmental policy; Livelihoods; Multiple stakeholders; Payments for environmental services; REDD; Viet Nam; Environmental protection; deforestation; emission control; environmental planning; environmental policy; land tenure; land use planning; livelihood; stakeholder; sustainability; Deforestation; Land; Payment; Lam Dong; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013743425

The wind tower was considered as the most familiar cooling strategy followed in the traditional architecture. However, the advanced air conditioning systems of the present time have removed the need for the wind catchers since the indoor comfort could not be achieved enough by the wind towers and at the same level that advanced air conditioning systems can do. Despite the integration of the Green Buildings in UAE, the cheap energy prices and the poor attention to energy efficiency buildings have converted UAE to one of the top ten countries worldwide that have high electricity consumption per capita. This work offers a low carbon proposal to solve the problem and demonstrates three strategies that can be adopted in UAE to implement energy efficient buildings without compromising on the indoor comfort and air quality. IES VE and RETScreen software were used to simulate and analyse the proposed strategies. Using proper wall construction material that has minimum thermal transmittance value is one of the strategies that can be implemented to reduce the air-conditioning operating time thus less energy consumption. In addition to its benefits to the urban area, Green Roof is the second strategy that can be also implemented in order to reduce the thermal transmittance value of the roof. The last strategy is to employ Photovoltaic Panels to produce clean energy and to reduce the reliance on the fossil oil-generated power. As an overall, the bundle of three strategies has proved its efficiency to reduce the cooling energy consumption. The total electricity saving was 15.45 (MWh) and with a percentage of 19.6% of the total base case cooling power consumption. © Avestia Publishing, 2017.","Energy efficiency; Indoor comfort; Passive cooling strategies; Sustainability; Thermal gain; UAE",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045048472

This paper details the technical aspects of this upgrade and validation of critical turbine blade flutter related parameters during commissioning. Significant performance improvement was achieved by implementation of aerodynamic redesigns of certain compressor and turbine components. An upgraded combustion system and newly installed continuous tuning and health monitoring systems provided operational flexibility and reduction in emissions. Due to historical issues with the 4th stage blade flutter, significant analytical efforts were invested in the structural redesign of the 4th stage blade to predict and avoid flutter and resonance regions. Latest methods of aerodynamic work calculations were employed during design to ensure flutter free operation of this component. Validation steps were implemented using blade tip timing technology to determine synchronous and non-synchronous vibration characteristics of the 4th stage blades during commissioning. Performance tests per ASME PTC-22 were conducted immediately before and after the outage to provide an accurate measurement of engine performance. Analysis of the performance data after installation and commissioning of the upgrade package confirmed the performance improvement objectives on power output and heat rate were achieved on these two units. Live monitoring and analysis of blade instrumentation data during commissioning and further analysis afterward confirmed flutter free operation of the 4th stage turbine blade.

With energy issues becoming increasingly important in this century, it is important to assess the situation in the transportation sector. In recent years, direct current (DC) systems has been progressing mainly in urban areas. Developing superconducting cable for railway power transmission should lead to increased regeneration efficiency, reduced power loss, equalization of load between substations, and fewer substations due to the smaller voltage drop. In order to verify to be formed as a system, it's needed to evaluate the circulation cooling, electrical current, cooling stress, laying through typical line and electrical test of notch operation. The superconducting feeder system was set up along the test track and conducted running tests, and then verified the system on a commercial line for the first time in the world. As the results of energy analysis, it can be 5% energy saving system on average rail line model. When it's converted into CO2amount of emission, it'll be reduction in 3.6 × 105ton-CO2/year in the world.

Here we propose a facile approach to assemble carbon nanotubes (CNTs) into monodisperse microparticles through rapid condensation and accumulation of CNTs in aqueous droplets in a non-equilibrium state. The droplets were generated by means of a microfluidic process or membrane emulsification, using a water-soluble polar organic solvent as the continuous phase. Because water molecules in the droplets were rapidly dissolved into the continuous phase, the CNTs were dramatically condensed and stable microparticles were finally formed. We prepared microparticles using both multi-walled and single-walled CNTs, and the size was controllable in the range of 10-40 μm simply by changing the initial CNT concentration. Interestingly, the morphologies of the particles were not spherical in many cases, and they were controllable by changing the type of the organic solvent and/or using additives in the dispersed phase. Physicochemical characterization suggested good compatibility of the CNT microparticles when used as supports for catalysts, adsorbents, and electrodes. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Drops; Emulsification; Molecules; Multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCN); Nanotubes; Organic solvents; Yarn; Adsorption properties; Carbon nano-materials; Membrane emulsification; Microfluidic process; Nonequilibrium state; Physico-chemical characterization; Polar organic solvents; Tunable morphologies; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016152005

Future changes of the current climate are expected to occur on different scales all around the globe, hence modifying the environmental background on the basis of which technological installations have been designed and operated. This can potentially threat the safety of the installations as well as their. The development of suitable tools aiming to predict the impact of climate change on technological installations is then essential in the wider context of climate change mitigation. Hydropower installations play often a crucial role not only as a long-term renewable resource of energy but also for flood control and water supply in the case of droughts. All these aspects highlight the increasing importance of such installations as well as their growing vulnerability to natural hazards. It is hence essential to enlarge the current understanding of the interaction mechanisms between such installations and the changing surrounding environment in order to take adequate measures for climate change adaptation and ensure the future safety and productivity of hydropower production. The current study aims to provide a novel model for the evaluation of the impact of climate change on the safety of hydropower stations. The approach adopted allows to include in the model the uncertainty inevitably associated with the input variables and to propagate such uncertainty within the analysis. The model proposed is finally applied to a realistic case-study in order to highlight its potential and limitations. © 2017 The Authors.","Bayesian Networks; Climate Change; Credal Networks; Hydropower; Imprecise Probabilisties","Bayesian networks; Climate models; Flood control; Global warming; Hydroelectric power; Safety engineering; Uncertainty analysis; Water supply; Climate change adaptation; Climate change mitigation; Credal networks; Hydro-power installation; Hydropower; Imprecise Probabilisties; Surrounding environment; Technological installation; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85043448253

Selective dispersion of rGO was achieved by varying the mixing-sequence of rGO in the polymer matrices under controlled shear pressure. Selective dispersion of rGO in the blend system has been investigated with FTIR, FESEM and a rheometer. FTIR analysis showed the preferential localization of rGO in the nylon phase when it melt blended first with nylon followed by PC. In addition, the mechanical and thermal properties of this blended system were also found to be higher than those of other blend nanocomposites. The rheological study showed that lower viscosity of nylon could be the reason for preferring dispersion of rGO in the nylon phase when blended first with nylon.

Furthermore, while early Pacific ICT-based climate change campaigns used iconic images of Pacific Islanders leaving their homelands, more recent campaigns have leveraged social media to depict Pacific Islanders not as victims but as ‘warriors’. This new imagery aims to empower Pacific Islanders and engender a regional Pacific identity that shows strength and solidarity on the Pacific’s stance towards climate change. © 2017, Pacific Media Centre, Auckland University of Technology.

The experiments were conducted in the delta lowland (DL) and hilly midland (HM), over three seasons (summer–autumn in 2011 and 2012; winter–spring season in 2012) with two water management treatments namely continuous flooding (CF) and alternate wetting and drying (AWD). GHG emissions were dominated by methane (CH4) emissions showing large difference among seasons, whereas nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were negligible and irrelevant in the overall carbon footprint. However, temporal patterns were not conclusive over the entire observation period. The observed seasonal CH4 emission rates ranging from 83 to 696 kg CH4 per ha were relatively higher compared to other field studies and can, at least in part, be attributed to organic amendments applied in accordance to farmers’ practice. The practice of AWD reduced CH4 emissions significantly (P &amp;lt; 0.0001) in all seasons, corresponding in average to 71 % of the emissions from CF. On the other hand, AWD had no significant effect on N2O emissions. The average seasonal CH4 emission in the DL (420 kg ha−1) was also significantly higher than in the HM (206 kg ha−1). Compared with IPCC default values, this data set from Vietnamese rice fields indicates a higher emission level and Scaling factor for AWD. The average grain yield across all sites and seasons increased by 4 % (P &amp;lt; 0.0002) relative to CF with the practice of AWD. © 2017, Springer Science+Business Media Singapore.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071376516

So far, most studies investigated injections at the equator or in a region in the tropics. Here we use Community Earth System Model version 1 Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (CESM1(WACCM)) to explore the impact of continuous single grid point SO2 injections at seven different latitudes and two altitudes in the stratosphere on aerosol distribution and climate. For each of the 14 locations, 3 different constant SO2 emission rates were tested to identify linearity in aerosol burden, aerosol optical depth, and climate effects. We found that injections at 15∘N and 15∘S and at 25 km altitude have equal or greater effect on radiation and surface temperature than injections at the equator. Nonequatorial injections transport SO2 and sulfate aerosols more efficiently into middle and high latitudes and result in particles of smaller effective radius and larger aerosol burden in middle and high latitudes. Injections at 15∘S produce the largest increase in global average aerosol optical depth and increase the change in radiative forcing per Tg SO2 /yr by about 15% compared to equatorial injections. High-altitude injections at 15∘N produce the largest reduction in global average temperature of 0.2∘ per Tg S/yr for the last 7 years of a 10 year experiment. Injections at higher altitude are generally more efficient at reducing surface temperature, with the exception of large equatorial injections of at least 12 Tg SO2 /yr. These findings have important implications for designing a strategy to counteract global climate change. © 2017. American Geophysical Union.

Therefore, the objective of this chapter is to ascertain the relevance and quality of climate planning in large and medium-sized cities in the Tropics. The chapter proposes and applies the QCPI-Quality of Climate Plans Index, consisting of 10 indicators (characterization of climate, number, quantification, relevance, potential impact, cost, funding sources, timetable and responsibility of measures, implementation monitoring and reporting). It is revealed that 338 tropical cities currently have a local development, emergency, master, mitigation, adaptation, risk reduction plan or a resilience or smart city strategy. These tools were unquestionably more common in large cities, especially in OCDE and BRICS countries, while they were rare in Developing Countries. Local development plans (Municipal development, general, comprehensive) were the most common in medium-sized cities, along with those with the lowest quality, while stand-alone strategies and plans (resilience, mitigation, sustainable, adaptation), applied mostly in big cities, present much higher quality. © 2017, The Author(s).","Adaptation plan; Climate change; Emergency plan; Master plan; Mitigation plan; Municipal development plan; Plan quality; Resilience strategy; Risk reduction plan; Smart city; Tropics","Climate change; Developing countries; Smart city; Tropics; Adaptation plan; Emergency plans; Master plan; Mitigation plans; Municipal development plan; Plan quality; Resilience strategy; Risk reductions; Planning",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022346234

According to the 11th United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal, climate planning should significantly increase by 2030. The Sendai framework for disaster risk reduction (2015) and the New urban agenda signed in Quito (2016) indicate how to achieve this goal through analysis, categories of plans and specific measures. This chapter identifies the main obstacles to the significant increase in tropical human settlements with a climate plan and the possible solutions. First of all, the distribution and trend at 2030 of tropical human settlements are ascertained. Then local access to information on damage, hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk, and the consideration of these aspects in the national guides to local climate planning are verified. Lastly, the categories of plans and climate measures recommended by the United Nations are compared with those that are most common today, using a database of 401 climate plans for 338 tropical cities relating to 41 countries. The chapter highlights the fact that the prescription for treating tropical cities affected by climate change has been prepared without an accurate diagnosis. Significantly increasing climate planning must consider that small-medium human settlements in the Tropics will prevail at least until 2030. And most effort will be required from Developing and Least Developed Countries. The recommendations of the United Nations concerning the preliminary analyses ignore the fact that local authorities usually do not have access to the necessary information. Climate plans and recommended measures are not those currently in use. We propose three areas of action to facilitate the mainstreaming of the recommendations in the tropical context. They require a renewal of the local planning process if we intend to reach the 11th SDG by 2030. © 2017, The Author(s).","Climate change; Climate planning; Mainstreaming; Open data; Open source maps; Plan guidelines; SDG; Tropics; Vulnerability","Open Data; Planning; Risk assessment; Sustainable development; Tropics; Disaster risk reductions; Least-developed countries; Local authorities; Mainstreaming; Open sources; Plan guidelines; Preliminary analysis; Vulnerability; Climate change",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022325426

Conceived in this way, the vulnerability assessment is rarely repeatable in time, cannot be compared with those carried out in other contexts and usually has low spatial coverage. The growing availability of open data at municipal level, routinely collected, now allows us to switch to vulnerability tracking (continuous, low cost, consistent with global monitoring systems). The aim of this chapter is to propose and verify the applicability of a VICC-Vulnerability Index to Climate Change on a municipal scale for Haiti. The chapter identifies open data on national, departmental and municipal scale, selects the information on a municipal scale on the basis of quality, identifies the indicators, evaluates the robustness of the index and measures it. The index consists of 10 indicators created using information relating to monthly precipitations, population density, flood prone areas, crop deficit, farmers for self-consumption, rural accessibility, local plans for CC adaptation, irrigated agriculture and cholera incidence. This information is gathered for the 125 mainly rural municipalities of Haiti.

In order to achieve this commitment, various measures should be taken. Due to the complex relationship between carbon emission and economic development, it is critical to quantify the impacts of different measures. Under such a circumstance, this paper is to identify the effects of carbon tax on the sectoral competitiveness in Shanghai by 2030 under unequal imposition of carbon tax between Shanghai and the rest of China by using a two-region dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. Research results show that different carbon tax rates in different regions would affect GDP of Shanghai and the outcomes are different under different scenarios. In general, a lower carbon tax rate can lead to a higher output and these output changes could further influence the sectoral competitiveness. Under the tax44 scenario, sectors such as agriculture, textile, transport equipment, and electronics are the winners in Shanghai, with outputs increased by 2.02%, 1.47%, 1.08% and 3.05%, respectively; while food production, petrol oil, chemicals and non-metal are the losers, with outputs decreased by 2.02%, 0.87%, 0.03% and 2.39%, respectively. This study also reveals that price and scale effects are the key factors influencing the changes of sectoral outputs.

The AABF was periodically (every 10 days) fed with an additional carbon source (10 L, chemical oxygen demand (COD) = 900 mg L−1 sodium acetate (NaAC) solution) in the anaerobic phase to induce the release of P sequestered in the biofilm. An increase in PHA storage in the biofilm was observed and characterized with TEM and a GC-MS method. The accumulation of P and removal of total nitrogen occurred primarily in the aerobic phase. As the NH4+-N loading rate increased from 0.095 to 0.238 kg m−3 d−1 at a total empty bed retention time (EBRT) of 4.6 h, the TN removal in AABF was reduced from 91.2% to 43.4%, while the P removal or recovery rate remained unaffected.

A relatively inexpensive energy source is critical to literally fueling technological and economic growth that outpaces, for a time, the rest of the world.

As the world transitions away from petroleum due to dwindling supplies, and in an effort to save the planet from a climate crisis, what might be the next big source of energy that will power the world economy? The question is particularly compelling if we are in the early days of a political-economic transition with China possibly surpassing the United States at some point in this century. Which of the two leading economies, and the world’s biggest carbon emitters, are leading the world in replacing petroleum with renewable alternatives? And is their pace to the new age of renewable energy fast enough to reverse climate change? We argue that both states conversion to non-fossil fuel are critical for the welfare of their own economies and the movement to respond to the threats emanating from climate change. However, neither state, albeit for different reasons, is embracing renewable or non-fossil fuel energy to the extent necessary to feel very confident that an energy transition will occur soon enough to do much good. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","CO2 emissions; Energy; Energy transition; Global warming; Renewables; System leadership",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042365987

However, implementing REDD+ in a populated landscape requires information on local costs and acceptability of changed practices. To supply such information, many studies have adopted approaches that explore the opportunity cost of maintaining land as forest rather than converting it to agricultural uses. These approaches typically assume that the costs to the smallholder are borne exclusively through the loss or gain of the production values associated with specific categories of land use. However, evaluating the value of land to smallholders in incomplete and messy institutional and economic contexts entails other considerations, such as varying portfolios of land holdings, tenure arrangements, restricted access to capital, and unreliable food markets. We suggest that contingent valuation (CV) methods may provide a more complete reflection of the viability of REDD+ in multiple-use landscapes than do opportunity cost approaches. The CV approach eliminates the need to assume a homogenous smallholder, and instead assumes heterogeneity around social, economic and institutional contexts. We apply this approach in a southern rural Cameroonian context, through the lens of a hypothetical REDD+ contract. Our findings suggest local costs of REDD+ contracts to be higher and much more variable than opportunity cost estimates. © 2017 by the authors.","Avoided deforestation; Carbon retention; Contingent valuation; Payments for ecosystem services; Reduced emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; Willingness to accept","Carbon; Climate change; Commerce; Cost estimating; Costs; Deforestation; Economic analysis; Economics; Ecosystems; Forestry; Land use; Contingent valuations; Forest degradation; Institutional contexts; Lost opportunities; Non-market valuation; Opportunity costs; Payments for ecosystem services; Willingness to accept; Cost benefit analysis; contingent valuation; deforestation; ecosystem service; emission control; environmental degradation; environmental economics; land management; rural area; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Carbon; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Cameroon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015046945

The chirped-probe pulse technique offers one of the shortest integration times of any laser diagnostic technique – appx. 3 ps, and excellent spatial resolution – appx. 1 mm along beam propagation and 75 μm in the transverse dimension. This paper outlines the current work, applying this technique to the two-phase combustion environment in a liquid-fuel spray burner. The research collaboration presented here involves fs CPP CARS measurements in a dilute spray flame of ethanol. This paper presents results from two flame cases: one premixed methane-air flame and one ethanol dilute spray flame. Time-averaged temperature profiles as well as temperature time-histories are presented for both flames. Sources of measurement error are discussed relating to the interference of the methane signal with the nitrogen signal and relating to liquid droplets passing through the laser probe volume. The 5 kHz data acquisition rate was rapid enough to capture smoothly-varying temperature profiles for all but the most turbulent regions. The buildup and decay of temperature oscillatory structures was observed at the flame-coflow boundary in both flames and is discussed. Continuing research is aimed at the expansion of this data set into more complex spray flames of intermediate density. © 2017 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

However, dairy farmers in Michigan have been unable to reproduce these results in their attempts to implement an LDL system. Designing and implementing a reliable LDL system increases production in dairy cows, cuts operating costs, decreases energy consumption, and reduces the emissions of harmful greenhouse gases, which incurs economic and environmental benefits for both the farmer and the state of Michigan. In cooperation with the MMPA, a long-day lighting project, funded by a grant from the Michigan Energy Office, was initiated by Biosystems and Agricultural Engineering Department researchers at Michigan State University to address the technical difficulties Michigan farmers have faced in implementing a successful LDL system. Milk production data was collected in the two years preceding and following the installation of the LED LDL system at Wing Acres Dairy. During the system's first year, milk production increased by 6.74%, or by 67,891 kg (149,674 lbs), compared to 2013. During the second year, milk production increased by 7.69%, or 77,465 kg (170,780 lbs). Averaging the data collected from 2014 and 2015 shows a 7.22% increase in milk production compared to 2013. Using LED fixtures in place of traditional metal halide fixtures to implement an LDL system resulted in an energy savings of 29,188 kWh each year, and a reduced cost of over $3,700 each year. Based on observations, the cows also appeared calmer, cleaner, and less aggressive towards each other.","Barns; Dairy farms; Data acquisition and control; Energy conservation; Engineering; Lighting; Michigan; Milk production","Agriculture; Cost reduction; Costs; Data acquisition; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Engineering; Fixtures (tooling); Greenhouse gases; Lighting; Metal halides; Operating costs; Barns; Dairy farms; Economic and environmental benefits; Michigan; Michigan State University; Milk production; Research studies; Technical difficulties; Dairies",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035349071

Infrared spectroscopy is a suitable means to support this requirement. Available instruments based on passive emission spectroscopy have difficulties in discriminating the infrared emission spectrum of the surface background from that of the contamination. Separation of background and contamination is eased by illuminating the surface with a spectrally tune-able light source and by analyzing the reflectivity spectrum. The project AMURFOCAL (Active Multispectral Reflection Fingerprinting of Persistent Chemical Agents) has the research topic of stand-off detection and identification of chemical warfare agents (CWAs) with amplified quantum cascade laser technology in the long-wave infrared spectral range. The project was conducted under the Joint Investment Programme (JIP) on CBRN protection funded through the European Defence Agency (EDA). The AMURFOCAL instrument comprises a spectrally narrow tune-able light source with a broadband infrared detector and chemometric data analysis software. The light source combines an external cavity quantum cascade laser (EC-QCL) with an optical parametric amplifier (OPA) to boost the peak output power of a short laser pulse tune-able over the infrared fingerprint region. The laser beam is focused onto a target at a distance between 10 and 20 m. A 3D data cube is registered by tuning the wavelength of the laser emission while recording the received signal scattered off the target using a multi-element infrared detector. A particular chemical is identified through the extraction of its characteristic spectral fingerprint out of the measured data. The paper describes the AMURFOCAL instrument, its functional units, and its principles of operation. © 2017 SPIE.","chemical warfare agents; chemometrics; European Defence Agency; external cavity quantum cascade laser; infrared detector; optical parametric amplifier; remote sensing; stand-off detection; toxic industrial chemicals","Agents; Chemical detection; Chemical equipment; Chemical warfare; Economics; Emission spectroscopy; Indicators (chemical); Industrial chemicals; Infrared detectors; Infrared radiation; Infrared spectroscopy; Laser beams; Laser chemistry; Light amplifiers; Light sources; Liquid films; Quantum cascade lasers; Remote sensing; Semiconductor lasers; Chemical warfare agents; Chemometrics; European Defence Agency; External cavity; Standoff detection; Toxic industrial chemical; Optical parametric amplifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026843870

The benefit of DME fuel properties, cetane number and heating value, is higher than the diesel fuel. In the present work was carried out to further the understanding into the engine performance and exhaust gas emission on single cylinder common rail. The engine fueled with diesel fuel and injecting additional DME fuel into the cylinder via intake manifold. The effect of DME additions, 0-90% of the total fuel, were demonstrated under different steady state operated conditions. The combustion of the DME port injection were improved thermal efficiency and reduced exhaust emission compared with the engine was operated with diesel fuel. The exhaust gas emission, i.e. nitrogen oxide and black smoke, was reduced from the engine operating at 30% DME concentration was used. In additions, diesel fuel consumption was reduced up to 22.36% lead to increase the brake thermal efficiency. Furthermore, the higher concentrations of DME are required to improve hydrocarbon and carbon monoxide emissions. However, optimised injection timing are very important in improving the engine performance under different engine operating conditions.","Common rail; Diesel engine; Dimethyl ether; HCCI; Port Fuel Injection","Alternative fuels; Carbon; Carbon monoxide; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Engine cylinders; Engines; Ethers; Exhaust systems (engine); Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gases; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Synthetic fuels; Carbon monoxide emissions; Common rail; Diesel engine performance; Dimethyl ethers; Engine operating conditions; HCCI; Improved thermal efficiencies; Port fuel injections; Dual fuel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041524008

Efforts to adapt to climate change impacts in East African societies have flourished. However, an area of research which has been neglected and could enhance adaptive capacity is bimonthly global-scale climate analysis in relationship to the long rains, during the climatologically prominent phase of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Empirical analyses were carried out using nearly 60 years of standardized gridded rainfall, horizontal wind and sea surface temperature (SST) data, to gain predictive understanding of the region’s climate. This study has delineated SST and divergent circulation features related to three of the four rainfall modes. The modes responded differently to the Pacific ENSO, Atlantic and Indian Oceans. However, there was no clear relationship between the second mode and the global SST distributions. Having substantiated this with monthly and seasonal-scale SST analyses, it suggested that this atypical pattern warranted numerical modeling studies or should be verified using other high resolution datasets. The SST predictor features identified may be used to enhance operational seasonal climate prediction scheme. In this way, end users would be better prepared to select appropriate climate change adaption options. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","East Africa; Long rainfall modes; Standardized global sea surface temperature anomalies; Standardized upper level circulations anomalies",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071513187

One of the most exciting changes will be represented by the network-wide optimal traffic control. When driverless vehicles take over the road, classical road signalization schemes will become superfluous. Accordingly, the paper's aim is to propose a control design methodology for autonomous vehicles in urban traffic network by considering the network-wide performance. The proposed two-level control strategy solves a tractable optimization problem for a network wide traffic control. On the one hand, a local intersection controller is designed which ensures safe crossings of vehicles and aims to reduce traffic emission in the junction area. On the other hand, the local controllers also optimize the network performance by minimizing the queues in all road links. The traffic is therefore modeled in a two-level fashion. A microscopic dynamics is considered in junctions and macroscopic model is applied for the whole traffic network. The control strategy is tested and evaluated based on microscopic traffic simulation. © 2017 The Authors.

The significance of this source is likely to become even greater in future engines with low-emissions combustors. In order to extract core noise from measured engine noise spectra, phased array data can be acquired on outdoor, static engine test beds and processed with an inverse method, which separates out the contribution of the individual, directional broadband noise sources as a function of far-field angle and frequency. One such method, called AFINDS, requires a parameterized model of the far-field coherence for each axially distributed jet exhaust noise source and for each transversely distributed 'source' at engine duct inlet/exhaust planes, that is the fan and core noise. Using full-scale engine data acquired on an outdoor test bed, AFINDS has yielded plausible source PWL spectra and directivity shapes for each source type, which do not change dramatically with frequency, as expected for broadband sources. One outstanding problem with the AFINDS method is the coincidence of the core noise source 'position' at the engine nozzle and the initial jet mixing noise region. To overcome this, AFINDS has been extended to incorporate a Wiener-Hopf solution for the coherence and directivity of the core noise radiation, which enables a more robust jet/core source separation to be achieved. Another challenge is related the need to acquire data on the noise of new combustor designs in a cost-efficient manner from indoor measurements taken in reverberant engine test cells. AFINDS has been recently developed to allow for the presence of a reverberant field and results for a core noise PWL spectrum from an indoor and outdoor engine test is shown to compare favourably.","Core and combustion noise; Phased arrays","Acoustic noise; Aircraft engines; Antenna phased arrays; Combustors; Engines; Equipment testing; Inverse problems; Piecewise linear techniques; Reverberation; Testing; Broadband noise sources; Broadband sources; Combustor designs; Engine test cells; Indoor measurement; Jet mixing noise; Parameterized model; Wiener-Hopf solution; Source separation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029453565

The injection pressure is one of major factor that determines CO2 migration phase equilibrium, and the flow rate influences the injectivity behavior and plume migration. However, data and knowledge of the injection pressure and the variation of velocity in displacement process are scarce. In this paper, we describe a set of laboratory tests on two-phase flow drainage of CO2 and brine. Fundamental characteristics such as the CO2 front, the breakthrough time and sweep efficiency, residual water saturation, due to the injection pressure and rate of displacement fluid was explored. The measurement is conducted at 40 °C under two different pressure conditions and four CO2 injection rate, representative of a CO2 storage operation. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) technique was used to observe pore-scale events in drainage process. After the injection of 3-5PV CO2, saturation of CO2 keeps constant indicating that the rest part remains inaccessible. The CO2 saturation at the last time for 8 MPa is higher than 6 MPa. Residual saturation and breakthrough time of different injection rate displacement procedures are different. The packed porous media is not perfectly homogeneous, so the CO2 run through the high permeability regions vertically in a short period. With CO2 injection, the brine saturation decreased gradually from the inlet of the bead-pack core, and the MRI image turned into dark gradually. The CO2 front proceeding in the porous media could be measured clearly, we can find CO2 ""channeling"" phenomena obviously in the case of gaseous CO2 displacement due to the difference of fluid viscosities and densities, and it can be seen from the profiles of 76 and 80 min. This phenomenon causes premature breakthrough of the CO2 to occur, thereby reducing the displacement efficiency of the water. And yet, the piston-like displacement occurred in the supercritical CO2 drainage experiment, due to the viscosity of supercritical CO2 is higher than gaseous CO2. According to capillary number definition, the Darcy velocity U keep invariable with constant CO2 flow rate, and the non-wetting phase (CO2) viscosity increase with the injection pressure increase. In other words, the displacement process capillary number of 8 MPa is higher than 6 MPa. The sweep efficiency in 8 MPa is slightly higher compared to the CO2 injection in 6 MPa. Therefore, supercritical CO2 displacement process is more practical than gaseous CO2 displacement process. The sweep efficiency will decrease for higher capillary number. At a small CO2 injection rate, the breakthrough time is long. A longer break through time resulted higher sweep efficiency. The CO2 flooding increases the displacement efficiency by raising the capillary number due to the relatively low interfacial tension values between the brine and the injected CO2. At high injection rate, especially 0.8 ml/min, the MRI image near the outlet region remain at high signal intensity in a relatively long time, indicating that the CO2-brine distribution does not change, since the displacement is steady. The sweep efficiency decreases as the injection flow rate increase, but the decrease extent reduces gradually. This means there is a critical capillary number for CO2 sequestration, which results in minimum sweep efficiency. In future experimental work, we will go into more detail about the critical capillary number. Within the capillary number scope of 10-9 to10-10, higher capillary number will decrease the CO2 sweep efficiency. © 2017 The Authors.","flow rate; injection pressure; MRI; porous media; sweep efficiency","Aquifers; Capillarity; Digital storage; Efficiency; Flow of fluids; Flow rate; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Magnetic resonance imaging; Oil well flooding; Porous materials; Two phase flow; Viscosity; Water injection; Wetting; Displacement efficiency; Experimental evaluation; Fundamental characteristics; Injection pressures; Interfacial tension values; Piston-like displacement; Residual water saturation; Sweep efficiency; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029667005

Deep, regional-scale aquifers in sedimentary basins are possible sites for sequestration, given their ubiquitous nature. For Carbon dioxide (CO2) to be stored in aquifers responsibly, it is essential to identify key concepts that need to be considered for potential implementation. Ideally, the injected CO2 will migrate through an aquifer from injection wells to remote storage sites, and remain isolated from the atmosphere for a considerable period of time. Fundamental topics of interest in sequestration research are not just concerned with scientific and technical aspects, but also with practical concerns, such as, economic feasibility of storage, safety, and the maximum possible amount of CO2 storage globally and for specified regions. Thus, it is crucial to have a robust understanding of this important process not only in theory, but in practice as well through illustration with solid examples as in this study. A robust commercial optimization and uncertainty software is coupled with a full-physics commercial simulator that models the phenomenon to investigate the significance of major parameters on performance of wells in CO2 sequestration, under geochemistry and thermal effects. CO2 injection is first done for 25 years then the injector is shut-in and the molecular diffusion of CO2 in water is modelled for the next 225 years. Thermal effects due to injection of CO2 are also modelled. Sensitivity and optimization have been done on major reservoir parameters, such as, fluid and rock properties and well operational parameters, and then significance of each has been illustrated through tornado diagrams. It is observed that a robust approach on handling of uncertainties in the reservoir is as important as management of well operational parameters in the scope of reservoir management. Presence of impact of geochemistry and temperature effects have proven to play an important role in the process.

The system consists of a cryogenic air separation unit, liquid oxygen storage, a gas turbine, a heat-recovery steam generator, and a steam turbine. The gas turbine is modeled allowing part-load operation. Computational optimization is used to maximize net present value (NPV) in order to examine the potential benefits achievable through upfront investments in increased flexibility (i.e., allowing price arbitrage between times of low and high price). Case studies of Germany and California are examined. Flexible SCOC-CC systems are not profitable in either region under current electricity prices. With electricity prices ≈2 times current prices, we find systems with positive NPVs. Oxygen storage is used in days with extreme price variability. Optimal designs favor constant operation, without over- or under-sizing system components and without additional oxygen storage. Sensitivity analyses show that external factors such as mean electricity price (± 200%), natural gas price (± 150%), and nominal discount rate (± 50%) have the strongest effect on NPV.

Russian peat resources represent more than 30 % of the global total. Peat production peaked during 1960–1980, when the volume of peat extraction was two orders of magnitude higher than it is now. The key factors that prevented further development of the Russian fuel peat industry were an inadequate regulatory framework for peat processing and the inability of peat extraction enterprises to overcome the energy supply monopoly of the coal, oil and gas industries. At present, the peat industry of the Russian Federation is in decline and its potential has been lost. Most of the power plants that previously operated on peat have been converted to coal and other fuels and, as a result, the occurrence of peatland fires has increased greatly. A case is made for revival of the industry to exploit peat as a local energy resource, employing modern processing techniques that can achieve full utilisation of the peat whilst reducing air pollution and generating little waste. © 2017 International Mire Conservation Group and International Peatland Society.","Energy resources; Local fuel; Peat stocks; Pyrolysis; Russian regions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029227931

The synthesized C-ZnO/rGO nanocomposite with flower-like ZnO micro-rods (MRs) synergistically inherited all the advantages of carbon doping and rGO heterojunction and exhibited high photocatalytic activity for the photodegradation of methyl orange (MO) under visible light. The x-ray diffraction (XRD) results indicated that in presence of GO, a new carbon-doped phase was formed at the high temperature and pressure of supercritical methanol. The x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) at low binding energies demonstrated that the valence band of C-ZnO-rGO is up-shifted by 0.35 ± 0.05 eV compared to that of ZnO MRs and narrowed the band-gap down to 2.9 eV. Under visible light irradiation, C-ZnO/rGO showed photocatalytic degradation of MO that was greatly increased by 4.5-fold compared to that of pure ZnO MRs. Measuring the photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance illustrated that C-ZnO/rGO showed higher photocurrent density in UV and visible region compared with those of ZnO MRs electrode. In addition, the incorporation of graphene sheets greatly suppressed the photocorrosion and photocurrent density decay of C-ZnO/rGO to only 0.5% and 10%, compared with 27% and 70% for neat ZnO MRs, respectively. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon doping; Photocatalytic degradation; Photocorrosion; Photoelectrochemical; Reduced graphene oxide; Supercritical methanol","Azo dyes; Binding energy; Energy gap; Graphene; Heterojunctions; II-VI semiconductors; Light; Methanol; Oxide minerals; Photodegradation; Photoelectrochemical cells; Reduced Graphene Oxide; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Zinc oxide; Carbon doping; Photo catalytic degradation; Photocorrosion; Photoelectrochemicals; Supercritical methanol; Photocatalytic activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021649955

To better understand understory responses to canopy disturbance, we measured changes in the growth and physiology of the dominant understory shrub, American witch-hazel (Hamamelis virginiana L.), in response to girdling of canopy oaks in a temperate hardwood forest of the northeastern United States. Changes in the growth and physiology of H. virginiana may be important to the regeneration of northeastern temperate forests, as this common shrub largely shapes the microenvironment for seedlings on the forest floor where it occurs. Canopy disturbance by girdling resulted in significant increases in light and soil nitrogen availability. In response to these environmental changes, basal-area growth of H. virginiana increased by an average 334%. This growth increase corresponded to significant increases in foliar nitrogen, respiration, and leaf chlorophyll and carotenoid concentrations. These findings indicate improved environmental conditions and increased growth for this understory shrub following the loss of dominant canopy trees. This study suggests that following large-scale canopy disturbance, H. virginiana and shrubs like it may play an important role in competing for soil N and shading seedlings of regenerating canopy species. © 2017, Canadian Science Publishing.

Ammonia is one such candidate. In this numerical study, ammonia is applied to a diesel engine via fumigation and a pilot fuel is used to ignite the premixed ammonia. Numerical simulations are carried out using the KIVA4-CHEMKIN code in order to better understand the effects of ammonia combustion on engine performance and emissions. It is seen from this study that ammonia reduces carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide emissions as it replaces the carbon-based pilot fuels. Moreover, nitrogen oxide emissions decrease with little ammonia fumigation and increase with high ammonia fumigation. This is due to combustion temperature, ammonia quantity and ammonia-air kinetics. Furthermore, it is interesting to note that as the injection timing is advanced, primary as well as secondary heat-release peaks are observed. The secondary heat-release peak is due to the combustion of residual fuel near the cylinder liner as well as in the crevice region and this is caused by an increase in in-cylinder temperature as injection timing advances. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ammonia; Carbon-free; Compression ignition engine; Diesel; Hydrogen energy carrier; Kerosene","Alternative fuels; Ammonia; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Diesel engines; Engines; Fuels; Fumigation; Global warming; Kerosene; Nitrogen oxides; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon-free; Combustion temperatures; Compression ignition engine; Diesel; Hydrogen Energy; Nitrogen oxide emissions; Numerical investigations; Ignition; ammonia; combustion; cylinder; diesel; diesel engine; emission; energy efficiency; fumigation; hydrogen; numerical method; performance assessment; reaction kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016395811

The biogas yield from biological treatment in sewage treatment plant (STP) contains about 60 % methane. Existing plant in Malaysia are lacking in capturing this by-product. There is a great potential for capturing biogas and combust it to harness energy. Centralised sewage treatment plant (CSTP) is suggested as long term solution for the increasing number of population and environment concern. Optimum location is an important criterion in building new CSTP in order to keep up with rapid development. The main objective of this study is to develop multi-period planning of centralised sewage treatment plant (CSTP) for electricity generation in Iskandar Malaysia. It can be divided into 5 stages; data gathering, problem formulation and superstructure construction, mathematical modelling, General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) coding and result analysis. In this study, GIS is used as preliminary step to generate and prepare data for mathematical model. It should plot the sources, substation and new location of CSTP. The software provides the distance between sources of sewage and new plant plus. The plant is able to produce 8 GWh/y of electricity. The model is capable of proposing location of new centralised sewage treatment plant, technology selection and its capacity.

Hence CO2 is recycled in the system, the effect of CO2 recycle on eachequipments should be clarified. In this study, the effect of recycled CO2 injection on coal gasifier performance was investigated by means of three-dimensional RANS-based numerical simulation. For estimating of coal gasifier performance, coal gasification and water-gas shift reaction are key phenomena. Therefore, the partially active site sharing coal gasification model and detailed chemistry of watergas shift reaction model were implemented. Calculated gasifier was a commercial scale entrained flow coal gasifier whose coal feeding rate is 70 tons per hour. The gasifier consists of a lower combustor part and an upper reductor part. The effect of coal feeding rate into the reductor, R / T, was investigated. The results show that temperature in the combustor decreases with decreasing R/T. In the lower R/T condition, hence air ratio in the combustor decreases, the reducing atmosphere becomes stronger. As a result, coal gasification which is end othermic reaction in the combustor is promoted. Although coal gasification is occurred in the reductor in higher R/T condition, total coal gasification rate is not so promoted compared with lower R/T condition. Due to the above mechanism, the gasification performance becomes higher with decreasing R/T. The results obtained in this study indicate that it is important that how much the higher gasification reactivity in a gasifier is exploited by optimizing local heat balance. © Copyright 2017 ASME.",,"Boilers; Carbon dioxide; Cell engineering; Chemical shift; Coal; Coal gasification; Combustion; Combustors; Condensers (liquefiers); Cooling systems; Gasification; Materials handling; Recycling; Steam condensers; Steam generators; Sustainable development; Thermoelectric power plants; Waste heat; Water gas shift; Detailed chemistry; Gasification model; Gasification reactivity; Operation conditions; Reducing atmosphere; Thermal power stations; Water gas shift (WGS) reaction; Water-gas shift reaction (WGS); Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029827869

In this work, density functional theory (DFT) calculations have been employed to study the reaction mechanisms of CO2 hydrogenation to CH3OH on Ga3Ni5(221) surfaces. The results show that all intermediates except for the O atom prefer to adsorb on Ni sites, and dissociative adsorption of hydrogen (H2) on the Ga3Ni5(221) surface is almost barrierless and highly exothermic, favoring CO2 hydrogenation. Moreover, the presence of Ga indeed enhances the dissociative adsorption of H2, and this is verified by the projected density of states (PDOS) analysis. Importantly, three possible reaction pathways based on formate (HCOO) and hydrocarboxyl (COOH) formations and reverse water gas shift (rWGS) with carbon monoxide (CO) hydrogenation have been discussed. It is found that CO2 reduction to CH3OH in these pathways prefers to occur entirely via the Langmuir-Hinshelwood (L-H) mechanism. COOH generation is the most favorable pathway because the HCOO and rWGS with CO hydrogenation pathways have high energy barriers and the resulting HCOOH intermediate in the HCOO pathway is unstable. In the COOH reaction pathway, CO2 is firstly hydrogenated to trans-COOH, followed by the formation of COH via three isomers of COHOH, its hydrogenation to trans-HCOH, and then the production of CH3OH via a CH2OH intermediate. © the Owner Societies 2017.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85025450497

Nine polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and five nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (NPAHs) in the airborne particulates were determined by HPLC with fluorescence and chemiluminescence detection, respectively. The concentrations of PAHs and NPAHs were higher in heating season than in non-heating season at the two sites. Both the concentrations of PAHs and NPAHs decreased in the non-heating season but only the concentrations of NPAHs decreased in heating season at site 1, from 2004 to 2010. These findings suggest that source control measures implemented by the city of Beijing helped to reduce air pollution in Beijing. The concentrations of PAHs increased at site 1 in 2010, possibly because of the transport of emissions from windward other areas, such as Shanxi province. Several diagnostic ratios of PAHs and NPAHs showed that the different sources contributed to Beijing's air pollution, although coal combustion was the main source in the heating season and vehicle emission was the main source in the non-heating season. An analysis of physical parameters at Beijing showed that high wind speed can remove atmospheric PAHs and NPAHs in the heating season and that high relative humidity can remove them in the non-heating season. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Beijing; NPAHs; PAHs; Source control measure","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Aromatization; Atmospheric humidity; Coal combustion; Heating; Mineral oils; Particles (particulate matter); Urban growth; Wind; Airborne particulate; Beijing; Chemiluminescence detection; High relative humidities; Nitropolycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; NPAHs; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHS); Source control; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; aromatic hydrocarbon; coal; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; coal combustion; concentration (composition); PAH; particulate matter; pollutant transport; pollution control; pollution monitoring; urban atmosphere; air pollution; Article; atmosphere; chemoluminescence; China; combustion; controlled study; exhaust gas; fluorescence; heating; high performance liquid chromatography; humidity; physical parameters; priority journal; season; velocity; wind; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Shanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008655901

The haze has not only affected the countries within the region, but even beyond because of the impacts on environmental concerns with greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and biodiversity thus challenging international attempts to address these issues. Fires associated with agricultural and plantation development in Indonesia impact ecosystem services and release emissions into the atmosphere that degrade regional air quality and contribute to greenhouse gas concentrations. One solution to clearing the biomass without fire may be to harvest it and use it for power. Economic benefit of biomass conversion to power is undeniable, however, there is still debatable question on the emission impact of biomass burning and biomass utilization. A biomass utilization process involving transportation of biomass feedstock to the processing plant as well as the processing of the biomass to power, emitted certain amount of GHG. This study aimed to assess and compared the GHG emission of open forest burning and the GHG emission from biomass utilization in direct combustion processing for electricity. The result showed that the biomass to power utilization alternative has a carbon reduction of 11.701 t CO2/ t biomass while biomass open fire burning activity contribute to 0.06 t CO2/ t biomass of emission, which is less favorable as compared to biomass to energy alternative which contribute to the emission reduction. © 2017 The Authors.","Biomass burning; biomass utilisation; GHG emission; power; transboundary haze","Air quality; Bioconversion; Biodiversity; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Emission control; Gas emissions; Biomass-burning; Emissions into the atmosphere; Environmental concerns; Environmental issues; GHG emission; power; Regional air quality; Trans-boundary; Greenhouse gases",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020700412

In this paper, CEPA is further extended to economy-wide systems where the segments of composite curves are comprised of sectors in a national or regional economy. This approach uses inputoutput analysis (IOA) to calculate carbon footprints of major sectors per unit of economic value; these are then subjected to pinch analysis using established CEPA methodology.

A power generating, dispatching and carbon emissions trading system (CETS) could be engaged in joint strategic planning and operational execution. The principal of CPDS is interactive planning of generating units in power generation and carbon emissions trading. An efficient carbon emissions trading plan for a CPDS would lead to optimized power generation levels under available power production capacities and carbon emissions. In a case study, four generator policies are proposed by considering basic CETSs to comparatively analyze the function of each generator in the CPDS. Results of four scenarios are compared, showing that biomass energy could replace thermal units to a certain extent, the carbon emissions and coal consumption of the CPDS would lie at a lower level, and a pumped storage unit could adjust the load fluctuations. The results of a carbon trading analysis show that the CETS has no significant impact on the CPDS, but along with the increase in trading price or the decrease in the free quota, the economic interests of power plants will be reduced accordingly. This may lead to carrying out low-carbon projects and reducing carbon emissions. Therefore, it is imperative to reduce carbon emissions by replacing power units with high energy consumption, and improve the consumption capacity of renewable energy. © 2017 by the authors.

Alternative fuels become a hot research point in vehicle for rapidly consuming of fossil oil resources. Biodiesel and GTL (gas to liquid) fuels are two typical alternative fuels for diesel fuel. Low blend ratio (≤10%) biodiesel and GTL fuels can be used in a diesel engine without modifying the engine's configuration. It is important to investigate the difference of low blend ratio biodiesel and GTL fuels used in the same diesel car and to find the optimum one. Gaseous and particle emissions from a light duty diesel car with B10 (10% biodiesel from cooking oil +90% diesel, v/v) and G10 (10% GTL fuel +90% diesel, v/v) was investigated. It was equipped with high pressure common rail system, cooled EGR and DOC and was tested on a chassis dynamometer under NEDC mode. Results show that, compared to diesel fuel: (1) B10 and G10 can both reduce the CO emission by 51.2% and 52.3% respectively during the NEDC cycle. The first urban driving cycle (UDC-1) has higher CO emission since low DOC efficiency in low exhaust temperature. (2) B10 fuel increases the specific HC emission by the proportion of 10.5% and G10 fuel decreases that by the proportion of 46.9% during whole NEDC cycle. (3) NOx emission increases with the use of B10 by 14.2% and decreases with the use of G10 by 6.8%. (4) The relationship of CO2 emissions of three kinds of fuels is B10 &gt; Diesel &gt; G10 for distinct difference in low heating value. (5) Particle number concentration in UDC-1 is higher than that in the rest three UDC cycles.

Higher conversion or yield in this case, allow bio-succinic acid to be more competitive and could potentially take over the market of other intermediate compound. Redox state of the fermentation medium is reported to have an effect on the metabolic flux and in Actinobacillus succinogenes, one of the best succinic acid producers. It has a direct impact on succinate yield. Therefore, carbonates with different reducing power, CaCO3, NaHCO3, MgCO3, ZnCO3 and (NH4)2CO3 were employed to investigate the effect of their reducing power on succinate yield from glucose. Results showed that a more reducing carbonate, CaCO3 promoted the metabolic flux of A. succinogenes to produce higher reductive metabolite (succinate) to regain its intracellular redox balance. Calcium has a reducing power of 2.87 relative to hydrogen. Ammonium carbonate has an oxidizing power of 0.27, or a negative reducing power relative to hydrogen. Therefore, CaCO3 with a stronger reducing power had a higher succinate yield of 0.68 g/g than (NH4)2CO3 with only 0.14 g/g. On the other hand, MgCO3 had the highest final succinate concentration due to the overall higher sugar consumption by A. succinogenes. © 2017 Penerbit UTM Press.

However, the demand of fossil fuel is rising day by day and hence the major fuel source of diesel engine, the petroleum based fuel, is depleting rapidly. Many countries depend mainly on imported fossil fuels due to lack of fuel reserves and it has great impact on the economy. In addition to this, the major concerns of diesel engine are its oxides of nitrogen and smoke emissions. Therefore, for the past several decades extensive efforts are being made to search for alternate fuels to overcome the dependence on fossil fuel and environment pollution. In this regard, several alternate fuels namely hydrogen, oxygenated fuels like alcohol fuels, dimethyl ether and biodiesel fuels etc., have been extensively analysed. Recent studies show that biodiesel is one of the most promising alternate fuels for diesel engines because of its biodegradable, oxygenated, sulphur free and renewable characteristics. Hence, it is getting the attention of researchers all over the world. The blends of biodiesel with fossil diesel have many benefits like reduction in emissions, lower engine wear, lesser engine oil consumption and comparable thermal efficiency vis-a-vis diesel fuel. Exhaustive experimental works have been carried out to analyse the suitability of biodiesel fuel as alternate fuel and to explore their advantages in diesel engines. Hence, this paper is attempted to present a comprehensive review on the performance, combustion and emission characteristics of some important biodiesel fuels on diesel engines.

Methods: Spatio-temporal kriging of daily PM2.5 and ozone (O3) was used to produce daily exposure estimates at the residence ZIP code. Time-stratified case-crossover analysis was conducted to examine short-term effects of PM2.5 on respiratory mortality, adjusting for O3 and apparent mean temperature. We studied both single and distributed lags for days 0-5. All-cause respiratory mortality and subcategories of deaths due to pneumonia and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) were studied. Results: A total of 15,747 respiratory disease deaths were identified. We found significant associations of PM2.5 in both single and two pollutant models (with ozone) with total respiratory disease mortality at lag day 4 in distributed lag models - a 7.0% (95% CI, 2%-12%) increase per 10 ìg/m3 PM2.5 in both of these models. Conclusions: The application of finer scale geographically resolved AP exposures made it possible to study acute effects of PM2.5 on respiratory mortality in a large metropolitan area. Our study results demonstrated the continued presence of a dose response relationship of increased risk of respiratory mortality within this lower range of PM2.5 exposure. We also noted for COPD, for two pollutant models in the summer season, there was a significant effect of ozone for single lag day five; each 10 ppb increment in ozone concentration was associated with an increase of 6.7% in COPD mortality (95% CI, 0.2-13.6%) compared to the cooler months.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039153192

In this study, projected future rainfall from a regional climate models (RCM) were utilized to assess the impact of potential change in rainfall on streamflow over the 3S Sub-Basin that encompasses Sekong, Sesan, Srepok Joint River Basins (3S Sub-Basins), a 78,650 km2 tributary of the Lower Mekong Basin. The RCM weather research and forecasting (WRF) has been utilized to dynamically downscale an ensemble of three Global Climate Models (CCSM3.0, ECHAM5 and MIROC medium resolution), under the Coupled Models Inter-comparison Project Phase 3 (CMIP3) over the historical baseline (1961-1990) and future (2011-2040) climates under two emission scenarios A2 and A1B. A hydrological model to estimate streamflow rate on a monthly basis was built and calibrated using various available rainfall and streamflow data within the watershed. The projected future rainfall was then applied to the calibrated hydrological model to determine potential changes in streamflow in the next 30 years, especially in critical low flow conditions. The projected rainfall indicates increases of up to 10%. The increases are likely to be more prominent in Srepok than Sekong and Sesan, and in Srepok the increase is likely to be more in the upstream than the downstream drainage area. The study also indicates an increase in average streamflow up to 10%, especially during wet periods. However, the dry flow in April was found to reduce for the future climate and the reduction might be greater in Sekong and downstream of Srepok. The results of this study would be useful to the policy makers and stake holders to devise their adaptive strategies in the context of changing climate.",,"Calibration; Climate change; Climate models; Digital storage; Electric power system interconnection; Groundwater; Groundwater resources; Hydrology; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Rivers; Stream flow; Sustainable development; Weather forecasting; Adaptive strategy; Global climate model; Hydrological modeling; Long term planning; Low flow condition; Regional climate models; Water availability; Weather research and forecasting; Water resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021435531

Smoke from a pyrolizing wood specimen in a cylindrical furnace (250-400 °C), diluted with cold air in the smoke chamber, was characterized using an optical aerosol sensor and solid-state microsensors for O2, CO2, CO, and hydrocarbons with reference instruments: a personal dust monitor, a scanning mobility particle spectrometer, and an optical CO gas analyzer. The particulate size distribution showed a peak of ultrafine aerosol particles (mode < 100 nm) at an early stage and then shifted to larger size (100-500 nm). The mass concentration of particles peaked at a few minutes after the heat exposure and decreased monotonically. The concentration of hydrocarbons generally peaks at the beginning and CO and CO2 continued to increase afterward. In the burn-room experiment, different fuels (wood pallet, mattress, and sofa) were burned individually in a controlled mode. The measurements of the heat flux and temperature and continuous gas sampling were made. The temporal variation of the heat flux correlates well, in general, with that of the gas temperature, showing an initial peak and a gradual decay, typical of small-scale burn tests. The variation in the mass concentration of particles correlates, to some extent, with the CO concentration. The results provide insight into the smoke characteristics and assist in developing a hand-held real-time particulate and toxic-gas detector.",,"Aerosols; Carbon dioxide; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Particle spectrometers; Smoke; Wood fuels; Concentration Measurement; Mass concentration; Particulate size distribution; Personal dust monitors; Real time measurements; Reference instruments; Scanning mobility particle spectrometers; Ultra-fine aerosols; Heat flux",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85036457331

In both Uganda and Ghana, uneven progress with implementing decentralisation reforms greatly limited local government action, and there was poor alignment of sectors they could influence and those with significant emissions reduction potential. In Polokwane, however, a highly devolved governance structure afforded the municipality authority and autonomy over a much wider range of functions.

Such formations are required to be overlain by an impermeable formation in order to prevent CO2 from leakage and migration, while also having sufficient permeability to allow injection without excessive pressure build up. Thus, any potential sequestration site should be extensively characterized to assess its properties for tight and permanent isolation of CO2. Achieving this goal is difficult without considering the heterogeneity and variability of the formations. Thus, a considerable number of samples covering the range of variability must be studied; pore morphology and connectivity in these samples are assessed using three-dimensional (3D) imaging techniques, which can be very costly and time consuming. As an alternative, one can use 2D images, which are widely available, as the input data to stochastically reconstruct realizations of the porous formation. To this end, we present a method by which one generates an ensemble of 3D realizations using one or very few 2D images by an iterative multiscale approach. The method first generates an initial 3D model and then progressively improves it by removing artifacts and refining the spatial connectivities. Thus, various possible realizations of the connectivity of the pore space can be modeled without much experimentation with actual 3D samples. These realizations can then be used in pore network or lattice Boltzmann simulation of CO2-brine flow processes. The method is utilized to reconstruct realizations of the Mt. Simon sandstone, the target reservoir for a pilot CO2 sequestration project conducted by the Illinois State Geological Survey, for which there is a large data base of rock core and 3D structure. Then, the flow behavior of a CO2-brine system is simulated in the reconstructed realizations. Quantitative comparisons for the multiple-point connectivity function, single-phase permeability, capillary-pressure-saturation functions, two-phase relative permeabilities, and the statistical properties of the pore network extracted from the data are presented. Good agreement is found in all the cases between the computed results for the reconstructed models and those of the actual sample. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emission; Geological carbon storage; Relative permeability; Stochastic simulation","Carbon; Climate change; Digital storage; Geology; Global warming; Imaging techniques; Iterative methods; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Carbon storage; Illinois state geological surveys; Lattice Boltzmann simulations; Quantitative comparison; Relative permeability; Statistical properties; Stochastic simulations; Three dimensional (3D) imaging techniques; Carbon dioxide; brine; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; computer simulation; flow modeling; permeability; stochasticity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009360854

We report on two studies - one with United States only ban and one with a global ban. We used a global computable general equilibrium (CGE) model, Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP), for the analysis. This model has been used in hundreds of published papers on trade, energy, land use, and environmental issues. Our use of the model was to estimate the crop yield benefits for the major GMO crops, and then to convert this to a loss if the GMO traits were banned. We then shocked the GTAP model with the yield losses and estimate economic, land use, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission impacts. We found that losing the GM technology would cause commodity and food prices to increase and also bring about a significant increase in GHG emissions. The increase in emissions is caused by the need to convert forest and pasture to compensate for the lost production. Another interesting conclusion of the global ban study is that economic well-being for the United States, the world's largest GMO user, actually increases with a ban. Many regions that ban or use little GMO varieties like the European Union, India, China, and Japan all see economic well-being decrease. These counterintuitive results are driven mainly by trade patterns. Therefore GMO technology helps agriculture reduce its carbon footprint. Without this technology, agricultural land-use GHG emissions increase as do food prices. Some groups would like to see GMOs banned and also see GHG emissions fall. You cannot have it both ways.

In addition to greenhouse gases such as CO2 or CH4, LULCC affects also the emission of other carbon trace gases such as biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). We investigate the impact of changing LULCC on the emission of isoprene and monoterpenes during the 21st century using seven different land-use projections, applying the dynamic vegetation modelling framework LPJ-GUESS. Climate change, and atmospheric CO2-concentration are based on the RCP2.6 scenario. The different LULCC-scenarios explore the impact of different land-based climate change mitigation strategies (such as afforestation and avoided deforestation, or bioenergy). We show that the increase of land area under crops or grassland would lead to a significant decrease of BVOC emissions, with a strong negative correlation between the fraction of managed global land area and the emission of isoprene and monoterpenes. But the choice of crops is important, especially for the bioenergy scenarios in which increasing fractional cover leads to decreasing BVOC emissions in our simulations; use of woody bioenergy crops can reverse this decrease. The strong impact of LULCC on the global and regional emission of BVOCs implies the need to include the impact of these changes in projections of atmospheric composition and air quality. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","BVOC; Isoprene; LULCC; Monoterpene","Air quality; Atmospheric composition; Biofuels; Carbon dioxide; Crops; Deforestation; Greenhouse gases; Isoprene; Land use; Monoterpenes; Reforestation; Volatile organic compounds; Anthropogenic climate changes; Biogenic volatile organic compounds; BVOC; Climate change mitigation; Land use and land cover change; LULCC; Monoterpene; Negative correlation; Climate change; carbon dioxide; isoprene; methane; terpene; volatile organic compound; air quality; anthropogenic effect; atmospheric chemistry; bioenergy; carbon dioxide; climate change; concentration (composition); emission; energy crop; global climate; greenhouse gas; land cover; land use change; monoterpene; twenty first century; volatile organic compound; afforestation; agriculture; air quality; Article; bioenergy; carbon footprint; climate change; crop; deforestation; grassland; greenhouse gas; land use; priority journal; reforestation; simulation; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021147069

Consequently, the actions on structures will be changing and present design practices will need to be adapted to provide for reliable structures with service lifetimes spanning over decades and centuries. A submitted review of present environmental and climate change information is focused on the distinct, but complementary climatic conditions of Central Europe and South Africa. An outline of the basis of structural design accounting for extreme wind and snow loads is presented and recommendations for future risk-based design procedures are discussed. Issues to consider include: a) use of extreme value models; b) implementation of changes in distribution parameters to obtain extremes with long return periods; c) consideration of the rate of the change. The example of a representative structure illustrates the effects of climatic actions on structural reliability. It appears that uncertainties related to the lack of observations hinder drawing strong conclusions concerning appropriate modifications of design procedures due to environmental and climate change.

Some are region-specific (e.g. availability of charging infrastructure) while others are global in nature (e.g. battery prices) where improvements spill over between regions. This study explores regional spillover effects and GHG impacts of strong ZEV-focused policy, specifically the ZEV mandate in place in ten U.S. states (“ZEV States”) which requires automakers to sell a minimum amount of ZEVs each year. We use a dynamic technology adoption model to simulate passenger vehicle sectors in North America, focusing on the case of one small region (British Columbia, covering 0.7% of the market) as potentially free-riding off of ZEV States’ policy (covering 23% of the market). Results indicate that free-ridership is not effective; even with the ZEV mandate driving very high sales in ZEV States, British Columbia cannot achieve significant ZEV adoption without also implementing its own ZEV mandate. Further, for British Columbia to meet its 2050 GHG targets, it may need a ZEV mandate in addition to complementary climate policies—pushing ZEVs to account for 40–93% of new vehicle sales in 2050.

It generates electricity from sunshine and stores the electricity in a battery for consumption during the night or cloudy days. SHSs generate direct current that can be used for a range of electrical appliances, from lighting and mobile phone charging to small televisions, air conditioner, computer or other appliances. By replacing fossil energy sources such as kerosene, candles and dry batteries, SHSs have the potential to reduce indoor air pollution and substitute energy expenditures. On the other side, one of the quite popular in Indonesia is Bantul batik, Yogyakarta Special Region. There are some Batik SMEs in Bantul. The issue of the SMEs is that the production process is still using kerosene stoves, while the price of kerosene is very expensive. Therefore, in this paper described the application of SHS for the batik production process. The SHS is used to distribute electrical power to the batik electric stove. The use of SHS and batik electric stoves is more practical and economical than kerosene stove. Another advantage is to reduce dependence on fossil fuels and help preserve the environment with the use of green technology. © Research India Publications.","Batik electric stove; SMEs batik; Solar home systems; Yogyakarta batik",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028928134

For this purpose a fan impeller with a defined operating point is designed. Preliminary investigations have shown that a volumetric flow rate of 18 m?/h at a pressure of 200 Pa is required for cooling. Due to structural restrictions, only one axial impeller with a diameter of 68 mm can be used. The rotational speed of the electric motor is 10000 rpm. In a further step, the influences of the blade skewing and irregular arrangement of the blades are examined. These impellers are manufactured in a rapid prototyping process, which is a cost-effective and fast process. Thus, various variants can be examined to find the most suitable impeller. The study of the impellers is divided into two phases. Firstly, the fluid mechanical data of the impeller is measured. For this purpose, a chamber test stand is used to measure the characteristic curves of fan impellers. Thus, on the one hand, it can be examined whether the designed impeller reaches the operating point and, on the other hand, the influence of the noise reduction measures on the characteristic curves can also be evaluated. It is, of course, not desired that the noise reduction measures result in a deterioration of the pressure increase or in the volumetric flow rate. In the second phase, the noise generation of the impeller is measured in an installed state on an acoustic test stand. For this purpose, the impellers are installed in the electric motor and then acoustically examined in enveloping surface method according to DIN 45635. It can be seen that the sound load can be reduced by 5.6 dB by a sufficient design of the impeller compared to a reference impeller. The further measures taken, such as the irregular arrangement of the blades and the blade skewing, have shown a further improvement of 1.6 dB. The influence of the implemented measures on the characteristic curve lies in a small area. It is measured that the pressure increase has fallen due to the irregular arrangement of the blades and the blade skewing by 10 Pa with a constant remaining flow rate. © Copyright 2017 ASME.",,"Acoustic noise; Cost effectiveness; Electric motors; Engines; Fans; Fluid mechanics; Hydraulic machinery; Machinery; Noise abatement; Characteristic curve; Enveloping surface; Irregular arrangement; Noise-reduction measures; Operating points; Pressure increase; Structural restrictions; Volumetric flow rate; Impellers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85033578294

In this work, we present a case study of the Danish municipality of Sønderborg, whose aim is to reach zero net CO2 emissions by 2029. Sønderborg has an official strategic plan towards 2029, which we compared with four alternative scenarios to investigate how the municipality could approach its target in the most energy-efficient and cost-effective way while simultaneously keeping biomass and waste consumption close to the limits of the locally available residual resources. We modelled all sectors of the energy system on the municipal scale, applying a broad range of energy conversion technologies, including advanced biomass conversion technologies and reversible electrolysis. We constructed five scenarios, each representing a different energy mix for Sønderborg's energy system in 2029. We modelled these scenarios using the mixed-integer linear optimization tool Sifre. We compared the results for the five scenarios using four indicators: annual total system cost, total energy system efficiency, annual net system CO2 emissions and total annual biomass consumption. The results show that scenarios with a high degree of electrification perform better on the selected indicators than scenarios with a high degree of biomass utilization. Moreover, the incorporation of advanced conversion technologies such as electrolysis, fuel cells and methanol production further reduces both the total system cost and net CO2 of the highly electrified energy system. Our sensitivity analysis demonstrates that scenarios with a low biomass consumption and a high degree of electrification are less dependent on changes in energy prices. We conclude that in order to achieve their CO2 emission goals in the most energy-efficient, cost-effective and sustainable way, municipalities similar to Sønderborg should compare a wide range of energy system configurations, for example, scenarios with a high degree of electrification and a limited biomass use. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electrolysis; Energy conversion; Energy system modelling; Mixed-integer linear optimization; Renewable energy; Urban energy scenarios","Bioconversion; Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Electric utilities; Electrolysis; Emission control; Energy conversion; Fuel cells; Integer programming; Linear programming; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Biomass conversion technologies; Conversion technology; Energy conversion technologies; Energy system modelling; Mixed-integer linear optimizations; Renewable energies; Renewable energy source; Urban energy; Energy efficiency; carbon dioxide; electrification; electrokinesis; energy planning; methanol; optimization; renewable resource; sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016489537

Using a gas-phase mixing method under various conditions, elemental sulfur was introduced into the mesopores with an average diameter of 12 nm. The all-solid-state cells consisted of the sulfur-carbon replica composite cathode, thio-LISICON solid electrolyte, and Li-Al alloy anode. The cells produced discharge capacities of approximately 1500 mAh g-1 in the 1st cycle, which is comparable to the theoretical capacity of sulfur. Thermogravimetric and X-ray diffraction analyses revealed that sulfur deposited inside the mesopores is the main contributor to the excellent performance of the battery. However, sulfur strongly interacted with the carbon replica, reducing the thickness of the carbon wall from 7 to 4 nm. This structural change in the carbon matrix triggered the deterioration of battery performance, especially the cycling capability. Optimizing the sulfur deposition conditions could therefore enhance the performance of batteries using such composite electrodes. © The Author(s) 2016.

Although socio-cultural challenges of energy transition have been recognised (Field, 2015; IPCC, 2011; Teske et al., 2015), understandings about socio-geographic places of energy transition and their underlying social processes and structures are insufficiently studied and often remain underestimated. To close this gap, we theoretically and empirically analysed the multifaceted interplay between place, local entrepreneurship and ‘community renewable energy’. Our study is based on an analysis of regional documents and policy reports, and on qualitative interviews undertaken with inhabitants in the case-study municipality of Reußenköge (Germany). Our findings reveal two important aspects: Firstly, people's individual and shared place meanings which materialised in social, physical, historical and climate-related place-attachments and meanings of contested and innovative place are important ingredients bearing an impact on processes of adopting or rejecting renewables. Secondly, differentiated characteristics of entrepreneurs, namely grounded, collaborative, innovative, change-making, economic, communicating, networking and political aspects, appeared to be relevant for the acceptance and support in community-based renewable energy projects. Our findings reveal that energy policies, funding schemes and administrative structures should recognise local socio-geographic important elements in the context of a sustained and decentralised energy transition. © 2016","Climate change mitigation; Community renewable energy; Energy transition; Local entrepreneurship; Place attachment","Climate change; Climate change mitigation; Community renewable energies; Energy transitions; Local entrepreneurship; Place attachment; Energy policy; alternative energy; climate change; empirical analysis; energy policy; entrepreneur; social structure; theoretical study; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85005963671

One is based on direct wind speed data. The second is based on the assumption that through physical mechanisms extreme weather events (local or mesoscale) are connected with largescale (synoptic) weather patterns. Using these methods, the regime of extreme winds over the seas of the Arctic is investigated. As known, climate models are more successful in simulation of average meteorological values than their extremes. But to minimize risks and damages from hazardous meteorological phenomena (including high wind speed) and to develop mitigating strategy climate projection of these events is required. As it was shown before for the storm activity over the Black Sea, Caspian Sea, Baltic Sea, it is possible to make projection indirectly, studying configuration and intensity of sea level atmospheric pressure (SLP) fields which are supposed to be the base factor of the wind speed and thus of wind waves. In this way, we don t need to run a wave model for the future climate, but to look in the climate projection for the fields of SLP which are associated with storm situations in modern climate. The same methodology was implemented for the high wind speed events in the Barents Sea. Four synoptic patterns in SLP were revealed for these situations for the modern climate (1981-2010, ERA-Interim reanalysis). Projection of their frequency for the 21 century was calculated on the base of CMIP5 models ensemble (RCP8.5 scenario). It was shown that despite intermodel variability of results more than half of models show increase of high wind speed values by the end of the 21 century over major part of the Arctic seas. Special attention was devoted to the frequency of weather types accompanying extreme winds over the Barents Sea.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Sea level; Speed; Storms; Wind; Climate projection; Extreme weather events; High wind speed; Intermodel variability; Meteorological phenomena; Physical mechanism; Storm activities; Weather patterns; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85040447234

This study examines the seasonal variability and trends specifically in synoptically classified lake-effect snow across the eastern Great Lakes region, and investigates the mechanisms responsible for observed changes. Using a synoptic climatological approach, days are identified where the synoptic-scale conditions are conducive to lake-effect snowfall and the associated snowfall is analyzed. Seven synoptic types over the November to March snowfall season are identified with characteristics of lake-effect conditions. Snowfall from these 7 lake-effect synoptic types represents between 45 and 53% of the seasonal snowfall total along the eastern shores of Lakes Erie and Ontario, with snowfall totals being highest during January. Lake-effect snowfall exhibits a 60 yr increasing trend downwind of Lakes Erie and Ontario; however, through examination over shorter 30 yr periods, a change in the trend of snowfall is observed around 1980. While a true trend reversal is not detected, lake-effect snowfall significantly increases from 1950-1979 before exhibiting no significant trend from 1980-2009. The inter-annual variability of seasonal lake-effect snowfall is highly related to the frequency of lake-effect synoptic types where an increase (decrease) in synoptic type occurrence leads to enhanced (diminished) lake-effect snowfall totals. Depending on the period examined, long-term changes in the frequency of lake-effect synoptic types and snowfall rates represent between 89 and 95% of the observed changes in lakeeffect snow. © Inter-Research 2017.","Climate change; Great lakes; Lake effect; Snowfall variability; Synoptic classification",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032674005

Copy number variations (CNVs) are large structural variations affecting the human genome. CNVs influence critical genes involved in causing NDJ by altering their copy number which affects the clinical outcome. In this study influence of CNVs on critical meiotic recombination was examined using new computational technologies to assess their role in causing aneuploidy. Methods: This investigation was based on the analysis of 12 random normal populations consisting of 1714 individuals for aneuploid causing genes under CNV effect. To examine the effect of CNVs on genes causing aneuploidy, meiotic recombination genes were analyzed using EnrichR, WebGestalt and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA). Results: Forty three NDJ genes were found under CNV burden; IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis) and KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) pathway analysis of CNV in meiotic recombination genes revealed a significant role of breast cancer gene 1, amyloid protein precursor, mitogen-activated protein kinase and nerve growth factor as key molecular players involved in causing aneuploidy. Interaction between these genes with other CNV-overlapping genes involved in cell cycle, recombination and meiosis might lead to increased incidences of aneuploidy. Interpretation & conclusions: The findings of this study implied that the effect of CNVs on normal genome contributed in amplifying the occurrences of chromosomal aneuploidies. The normal individuals consisting of variations in the susceptible genes causing aneuploids in the population remain undetected until the disorder genes express in the succeeding generations. © 2017, Indian Council of Medical Research.

A rapidly increasing world population leads to increased demand for food. Indonesia, which is the fourth most populous country of the world, also faces the challenge to increase food production for food security. A number of issues concerning food security also require finding a comprehensive solution together, including an increase in the production of agricultural commodities such as soybeans, maize, and rice toward self-sufficiency, then a sustainable self-sufficiency, and eventually achieving a surplus of 10 million tons of rice. Marginal land such as peatland and upland have the potential to be used for producing food, even though the productivity is low. Using marginal area for producing food has consequences in terms of technology innovation to improve land productivity and to reduce environmental degradation. The Mega Rice Project (MRP) in Central Kalimantan has a source record on the peatland agriculture. Without proper planning, construction of a 4400. km canal caused peatland destruction in this area. More than 1.4 million hectare of peatland forest became drained and degraded. Degraded peatlands caused by MRP should be reforested and rehabilitated to get the intended benefits to the local farmers in terms of food security and also reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) as a target of the government of Indonesia. This chapter reviews the prospects of sustainably reclaiming peatlands for agriculture purposes to support food security and also address to a certain extent the GHG emissions from peatlands. Strategy for sustainable development, in terms of supporting food security and mitigating GHG emissions, emphasizes the use of degraded peatland in the former MRP as an illustration. Food crop area and plantation area should be set up in the appropriate proportion to optimize the benefit and maximize the reduction in GHG emissions. The simulation model shows that the target of reducing GHG emissions can be achieved in sustainable peatland agriculture while simultaneously supporting food security by improving food production and improving farmer income. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

More importantly, the role of KOH was thoroughly discussed via various characterizations, control experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. It was found that KOH decoration did not result in any significant difference regards to the morphology, elemental states, BET surface area and light adsorption of g-C3N4 except a drastically enhanced CO2 adsorption capacity. The promotion effect of KOH on g-C3N4 was mainly contributed by the hydroxide ion (OH−) functioning as both a hole accepter and a driving force to keep a dynamically stable amount of H2CO3 (probably the major form of CO2 to be reduced) on the surface of the catalyst. Moreover, the different extents of influence of NaOH and KOH on g-C3N4 were revealed and further explained using computational results.

Few studies were carried out to investigate the expansion of drainage and desorption area based on the characteristics of pressure propagation in CBM reservoir. Moreover, the production rate and bottom-hole pressure (BHP) are usually variable, while the production system in current analytical models are either at constant production rate or constant BHP. When optimizing the production system of CBM well, the knowledge of expansion principle of drainage and desorption area can help obtain the critical time of interference and its intensity, which are both key factors for efficient development of CBM reservoirs. In this paper, a comprehensive method for drainage and desorption area expansion during coal-bed methane production is proposed, in which the variable rate and BHP in different production stages and saturation distribution are considered. The coal seam is divided into two areas, namely desorption and without-desorption area, and the production life is divided into five stages. The pressure profiles at different production stages are detailed investigated utilizing diffusivity equation which is solved by the continuous succession of steady states. By assuming the desorption area with low water-gas ratio and without-desorption area with high water-gas ratio, the pressure-squared approach is applied in desorption area and pressure approach is employed in without-desorption area. Finally, a model for predicting drainage and desorption area is developed by generating pressure profile and material balance equation. The proposed semi-analytical model is verified by numerical simulation with excellent agreement with the simulation data. Results show that the drainage area expands much faster at early production stage than that at late stage when desorption area starts expanding in the coal-bed reservoir. In addition, the production system of CBM well is found to play a significant role in the expansion characteristics of desorption area. Considering these characteristics of CBM, we shed light on the production system optimization in different production stages and apply the developed production system to a CBM well in Qinshui field, China. In summary, this method only requires BHP, gas and water production, and turns out to be simple, reliable and powerful in application. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Coal-bed methane; Continuous succession of steady states; Drainage and desorption area; Production system optimization; Semi-analytical model","Analytical models; Bottom hole pressure; Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Desorption; Methane; Oil well production; Pressure; Transient analysis; Well spacing; Characteristics of pressures; Field development plans; Material balance equation; Pressure transient analysis; Production system; Saturation distribution; Semi-analytical model; Steady state; Natural gas wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019564177

Policymakers encourage people to use bikes by improving cycling facilities as well as developing bicycle-sharing systems (BSS). It is increasingly interesting to investigate how environmental factors influence the cycling behavior of users of bicycle-sharing systems, as users of bicycle-sharing systems tend to be different from regular cyclists. Although earlier studies have examined effects of safety and convenience on the cycling behavior of regular riders, they rarely explored effects of safety and convenience on the cycling behavior of BSS riders. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to investigate how road safety, convenience, and public safety affect the cycling behavior of BSS riders by controlling for other environmental factors. Specifically, in this study, we investigated the impacts of environmental characteristics, including population density, employment density, land use mix, accessibility to point-of-interests (schools, shops, parks and gyms), road infrastructure, public transit accessibility, road safety, convenience, and public safety on the usage of BSS. Additionally, for a more accurate measure of public transit accessibility, road safety, convenience, and public safety, we used spatiotemporally varying measurements instead of spatially varying measurements, which have been widely used in earlier studies. We conducted an empirical investigation in Chicago with cycling data from a BSS called Divvy. In this study, we particularly attempted to answer the following questions: (1) how traffic accidents and congestion influence the usage of BSS; (2) how violent crime influences the usage of BSS; and (3) how public transit accessibility influences the usage of BSS. Moreover, we tried to offer implications for policies aiming to increase the usage of BSS or for the site selection of new docking stations. Empirical results demonstrate that density of bicycle lanes, public transit accessibility, and public safety influence the usage of BSS, which provides answers for our research questions. Empirical results also suggest policy implications that improving bicycle facilities and reducing the rate of violent crime rates tend to increase the usage of BSS. Moreover, some environmental factors could be considered in selecting a site for a new docking station. © 2017 by the author.","Crowdsourced geographic information; Divvy; Traffic accidents; Traffic congestion; Violent crime","accessibility; accident; crime; cycle transport; employment; environmental factor; land use; population density; public transport; site selection; traffic congestion; transportation infrastructure; transportation safety; travel behavior; Chicago; Illinois; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021079918

The heat recovery from high temperature slags (1450–1650 °C) from the metallurgical process represents one of the greatest potential to reduce the carbon emission in the steel industry (460 million tons of blast furnace slags (BFS) and 150 million tons of steel slags (SS) in 2012). The basic constraints of slag heat recovery include the low thermal conductivity and the easy crystallization trend. To meet these constraints and achieve the aim of heat recovery, many methods have been proposed and investigated during the past few decades, which could be divided into physical method, chemical method, and other method based on the working mechanism. The fundamental property of the hot slags that the cooling path of the slags could be composed of three regions, namely the liquid region, the crystallization region and the solid region, determined that a two-step physical method composed of a granulation atomizer and a fluidized bed for heat transfer and a two-stage process combined with physical dry granulation and chemical reaction are theoretically reasonable, which represents the research trend nowadays. The combination of the phase change material (PCM) heat storage and chemical methods could make up another research trend in the future especially when the crystallization behavior of the molten slags could be ignored. Besides, in the integrated system proposed recently, the obtained glassy blast furnace slags could be utilized in the cement industry because of the severe challenge of GHG emission reduction in the cement industry (3.7 billion tons of CO2 in 2013). Only by employing a reasonable and efficient method, could the waste heat in the high temperature slags be effectively recovered and target of the GHG emission reduction in the steel industry be achieved. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Chemical method; Emission reduction; Energy saving; Heat recovery; High temperature slag; Integrated system; Physical method","Blast furnaces; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Cements; Crystallization; Emission control; Energy conservation; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Global warming; Granulation; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Heat transfer; Integrated control; Phase change materials; Reduction; Slags; Steelmaking; Thermal conductivity; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Chemical method; Emission reduction; High temperature; Integrated systems; Physical methods; Steel metallurgy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84994496744

As the country's leading economic engines, three major economic circles representing 6.5% of the national land territory contributed to more than 2/5 of national gross domestic product (GDP). This paper focuses on the impact of these three growth poles in China's regional development, particularly for their embodied energy uses in light of multi-regional input-output analysis. Significantly, the three developed areas generated huge demands for embodied energy, 1237.52 Mtce and 40.1% of the total domestic supply in 2010, but far from self-sufficient. In Yangtze-River-Delta, Pearl-River-Delta and Jing-Jin-Ji, 93.1%, 85.1% and 63.4% of their embodied energy uses respectively can be traced back to the energy-supply provinces such as Shanxi, Inner Mongolia and Shaanxi and other trade partners. Over a half of the national interregional transfers of embodied energy via domestic trade were induced by the three economic circles’ final demand, largely resulted from their large-scale infrastructure construction, upgraded consumption structures, high export dependency and ongoing urbanization process. The results indicate that demand-driven embodied energy is a comprehensive indicator to reflect the real energy use patterns of developed regions or megacities and reveal their industrial positions in domestic and even global supply chains. Understanding the temporal and spatial energy transition along with regional development from consumption-based insights is a vital step toward appropriately targeted policy making for the nationwide energy saving and emission reduction. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Embodied energy; Interregional trade; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Three economic circles in China","Commerce; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Supply chains; Consumption structure; Economic circles; Embodied energy; Energy saving and emission reductions; Gross domestic products; Input output analysis; Large scale infrastructures; Temporal and spatial; Regional planning; demand analysis; electricity supply; energy use; Gross Domestic Product; input-output analysis; pattern recognition; regional development; renewable resource; supply chain management; China; Jingjinji; Nei Monggol; Shaanxi; Shanxi; Yangtze Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009174980

This paper explores the regional similarities and disparities of power generation emissions among 30 provinces. First, the affinity propagation (AP) algorithm is applied to find the similar characteristics in emissions among 30 provinces. The clustering results of CO2 emissions indicate that the 30 provinces are divided into five clusters in 1997 and seven clusters in 2012 based on four indicators (generation structure, energy intensity, GDP per capita and electricity intensity). Then, the regional differences in driving forces on CO2 emissions from power industry are examined using refined Laspeyres decomposition model. Results showed that there are significant contribution differences of five indicators (power generation emission coefficient, generation structure, electricity intensity, economy and population) on power generation emissions among different provinces. The provincial emissions reduction target and supporting policies for power industry should be customised and consistent with the actual situations considering the similarity and differences in emission characteristics.

As a result, ecological impacts become highlight in the national circular economy practices. To apply the eco-industrial development strategy to address the intertwined industrial and regional economic development, as well as related environmental and ecological challenges is key point. Urban industrial symbiosis provides a novel approach to realize the above expectation. Traditional evaluation on circular economy provided critical environmental insights, while to date, ecological evaluation has been rather few for urban industrial symbiosis promotion. With this circumstance, this paper developed an integrated material flows analysis (MFA) and emergy evaluation model to investigate the environmental and ecological benefits of urban industrial symbiosis implementation in one typical industrial city in China. Local oriented urban industrial symbiosis network was analyzed. Inter flows and related environmental benefits of symbiotic network were quantified with MFA, and further ecological impacts were evaluated with emergy approach and the designed emergy index. From the environmental perspective, results highlighted, in general, urban industrial symbiosis generated significant life cycle environmental benefits, especially the reduction of upstream resource mining and downstream waste disposal within the regional metabolism. In total, around 204.7 million tons ore mining, 6.9 million ton solid waste and 2.3 million tons CO2emissions were reduced per year. From the ecological perspective, total emergy input was reduced by 1.3 × 1022sej, which reflected the reduction of ecological burden. Particularly, as a key indicator for ecological lost caused by pollution, dilution emergy was decreased by 2.5 × 1016sej, resulting from carbon mitigation co-benefit of urban industrial symbiosis. This paper provided modeling approach to understand the ecological benefits and trade-offs of circular economy practices, and critical insights on regional eco-industrial development. It will shed a light on ecological civilization construction in China in the new national planning period. © 2016 Elsevier B.V.","China; Ecological civilization; Emergy; Regional eco-industrial development; Urban industrial symbiosis","Ecology; Economic and social effects; Industrial waste disposal; Regional planning; China; Eco-industrial development; Ecological civilization; Emergy; Industrial symbiosis; Industrial economics; development strategy; ecological impact; emergy; environmental assessment; environmental indicator; industrial development; material flow analysis; national planning; network analysis; pollution control; symbiosis; air pollutant; analysis; Article; ash; carbon footprint; China; circular economy practice; coal flying ash; ecobenefit assessment; ecological beneficial ratio; ecological phenomena and functions; economic aspect; emergy evaluation; emergy evaluation model; emergy yield ratio; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental impact; environmental loading ratio; environmental parameters; environmental risk; flow measurement; industry and industrial phenomena; life cycle assessment; material flows analysis; mining; nonbiological model; recycling; regional ecoindustrial development; resource mining; risk; solid waste; urban industrial symbiosis; waste disposal; China; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Liuzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027937143

A methane-based membrane biofilm reactor (MBfR) has been successfully demonstrated for perchlorate reduction, which provided an alternative solution for perchlorate remediation with low cost. In this work, a multispecies biofilm model was developed to evaluate perchlorate reduction in the methane-based MBfR under different operational conditions. The model was calibrated and validated using the experimental data from the long-term operation of the MBfR at seven distinct stages. The results suggested that the developed model could satisfactorily describe perchlorate reduction and denitrification performances in the MBfR (R2 &gt; 0.9). The modeling results provided insight into the microbial community distribution in the biofilm, with aerobic methanotrophs and perchlorate reduction bacteria being mainly located at the membrane side (∼60%) and heterotrophic bacteria being situated near the liquid side (∼50%). The model simulations indicated that over 80% of perchlorate removal efficiency could be achieved through controlling the optimal combinations of methane pressure (PCH4) and perchlorate loading (LClO4) (e.g., applying a PCH4 of 30 kPa at a LClO4 of 0.08 g Cl/m2/d). In addition, the perchlorate reduction would be inhibited by the presence of nitrate and nitrite in the MBfR, which should be appropriately controlled during the future practical application of the promising process. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Biofilm model; Membrane biofilm reactor; Methane; Perchlorate removal; Practical application","Aerobic bacteria; Bacteria; Biofilms; Bioreactors; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Health risks; Methane; Surface waters; Biofilm models; Heterotrophic bacterias; Membrane biofilm reactor; Multi-species biofilms; Operational conditions; Perchlorate remediation; Perchlorate removal; Surface water and groundwaters; Inorganic compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026299670

Only using experimental methods is difficult to get detailed knowledge of the factors that affect rock properties, such as pore geometry, cementation state, and pore morphology. Digital Rock Physics (DRP) techniques relying on imaging technologies can be used to obtain estimates for various macroscopic rock properties from digital rock images. But DRP study in carbonates is always a challenge due to their complex pore structures and heterogeneity. Single resolution image cannot be used to address all issues of the calculations of rock properties, thus, multi-scale image fusion technique is needed. In this paper, we present a case study on calculation of rock properties with multi-scale image fusion method for five carbonate rock samples. Both 2D Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images and 3D X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) images are used to do the simulations of rock properties, such as porosity, permeability, P- and S-wave velocities.

In Northeast China, energy consumption for space heating represents a significant proportion of total rural residential energy consumption and has reached 100 million tce (tons of standard coal equivalent), or more than 60% of total household energy consumption. In terms of energy consumption per square meter of gross floor area, rural residential energy consumption for heating is more than that of cities (20kgce/m2). However, the average indoor temperature of most rural residence is below 10°C, much less than that in cities (18° C). Hence, it is an important task for Chinese energy saving and emission reduction to reduce rural residential energy consumption, while enhancing indoor thermal comfort at the same time. Restricted by local technology and low economic level, rural residences currently have poor thermal insulation resulting in severe heat loss. This paper reports on research aimed at developing design strategies for improving thermal insulation properties of rural residences with appropriate technology. A field survey was conducted in six counties in severe cold areas of Northeast China, addressing the aspects of indoor and outdoor temperature, humidity, internal and external surface temperature of building envelop enclosure, and so on. The survey data show the following: 1. Modern (after 2000) brick-cement rural residences perform much better than the traditional adobe clay houses and Tatou houses (a regional type of rural residence in Northeast China - see figure A) in overall thermal performance and indoor thermal comfort; 2. Among the traditional residential house types, adobe clay houses have better heat stability and thermal storage capacity than Tatou houses; 3. Applying an internal or external thermal insulation layer can greatly improve rural residential thermal insulation properties, and is an economical and efficient solution in rural areas; 4. In terms of roofing materials, tiled roofs show much better thermal insulation properties than thatch roofs; 5. Adopting passive solar techniques can form a transition space (greenhouse) against frigid temperatures, resulting in interior temperatures 5.91°C higher than the outside surroundings. It is evident that local passive solar room design offers significant heat preservation effects and lower cost ($12/m2), embodies the ecological wisdom of rural residents, and is therefore important to popularize. The above experimental results can provide guidance in energy conservation design for both self-built residences and rural residences designed by architects. In addition, the results can also provide experimental data for energy-saving studies for rural residences in China.","Envelope Enclosure; Roof material; Rural Residence; Severe cold areas of Northeast China; Solar room",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020415864

Here, we report investigations towards the soil microbial community composition and diversity in the different degeneration wetlands types. Bacterial and fungal communities in the soil types were compared using high resolution bar-coded pyrosequencing technology. The results revealed that the bacterial and fungal diversity was lower in wet marshland than in drier marsh meadow and dry meadows.The distribution of sequence reads into different bacterial and fungal phyla further differed between the soil samples. The wet marsh soil displayed a higher abundance of Proteobacteria but lower abundance of Acidobacteria, while the higher abundance of unclassified fungi but smaller fractions of Ascomycota and Basidiomycota than the other soil types.The results reported here demonstrate that soil bacterial and fungal communities change as a result of differences in the soil environment in the Sanjiang Plain. © 2017, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.","Bacterial diversity; Community structure; Fungal diversity; Microorganism; Miseq; Wetland degradation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013218684

In the case of CO, CH4 and O2, multilayer growth begins prior to saturation of the monolayer peak, resulting in two clearly distinguishable desorption peaks. On the other hand, a single peak for CO2 is observed which shifts from high temperature at low coverage to low temperature at high coverages, sharpening upon multilayer formation. The leading edges are aligned for all the molecules in the multilayer coverage regime indicating zero order desorption.We have extracted multilayer desorption energies for these molecules using an Arrhenius analysis. For sub-monolayer coverages, we observe an extended desorption tail to higher temperature. Inversion analysis has been used to extract the coverage dependent desorption energies in the sub-monolayer coverage regime, from which we obtain the desorption energy distribution. We found that owing to the presence of multiple adsorption energy sites on the crystalline surface the typical desorption energies of these small molecules are significantly larger than obtained in previous measurements for several other substrates. Therefore molecules bound to crystalline silicate surfaces may remain locked in the solid state for a longer period of time before desorption into the gas phase. © 2018 The Author(s).","Astrochemistry; ISM: clouds; Methods: laboratory: molecular; Methods: laboratory: solid state; Molecular data; Solid state: volatile",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044020734

The concept of urban CO2 networks extends the approach developed by the refrigeration industry by bringing heat from the environment to neighbourhoods, similarly to tempered water district heating and cooling networks. However, unlike the water network, the CO2 network uses phase change to transfer heat between plants, interfacing the network with the environment and with the users. For each user, the heat is supplied/retrieved at the appropriate temperature, by connecting the best suited energy conversion technology. Besides its capacity to harvest and distribute heat from the environment (sun, underground, lake/river or waste heat), the CO2 network turns into a multi-energy power to gas system when coupled with a solid oxide fuel cell-solid oxide electrolysis cell system.

The performance of the portable FTIR resulted to be comparable to that of a laboratory-based FTIR during a series of experiments performed in the Vehicle Emission Laboratory (VELA) using the World-harmonized Light-duty Test Cycle (WLTC). Higher on-road NH3 emission factors were obtained for the gasoline vehicle than for the diesel. High NOx emissions were measured from the diesel vehicle, indicating a low efficiency of the DeNOx system, SCR.

However, NH3 cold start emissions from the gasoline vehicle were up to 2 orders of magnitude higher than during the entire road trips, ranging from 45 to 134 mg km−1. Cold start emissions are of paramount importance as they commonly take place in urban areas. Hence, future urban reductions in PM2.5 might need to take into consideration the introduction of NH3 emissions limits for passenger cars. © 2017 The Authors","Ammonia; Cold start emissions; Particulate precursor; Portable measurement; Real driving emissions","Air quality; Ammonia; Atmospheric radiation; Automobiles; Budget control; Diesel engines; Diesel locomotives; Gasoline; Roads and streets; Cold start; Diesel passenger cars; Light duty vehicles; Orders of magnitude; Particulate precursors; Real drivings; Real-world drivings; Urban air quality; Road vehicles; ammonia; biodiesel; gasoline; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; air quality; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; automobile; diesel engine; environmental conditions; measurement method; particulate matter; road traffic; traffic emission; urban atmosphere; air quality; Article; car driving; combustion; comparative study; controlled study; diesel engine; exhaust gas; high temperature; infrared spectroscopy; laboratory test; limit of detection; low temperature; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; priority journal; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026773777

However, the different components that constitute the QDSCs and the difficulty of isolating experimentally their effects on the performance of the whole system slow down the development of more efficient devices. In this work, DFT calculations are combined with a bottom-up approach to differentiate the effect of each component on the electronic structure and absorption spectra. First, Cu2S QDs were built including a U parameter to effectively describe the localization of electrons. The effect of capping agents is addressed using ligands with different electron-donating/withdrawing groups. The role of linkers and their adsorption on the oxide surface are also examined. Finally, we propose a main indirect electron injection mechanism based on the position of the peaks of the spectra. © the Owner Societies 2017.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021876070

Navigating in the Arctic offers opportunities and challenges for waste heat recovery systems (WHRS). Lower temperatures require larger heating power on board, hence a larger demand for waste heat usage, to cover services and maintaining on board spaces temperatures. However, a lower heat rejection temperature increases the WHRS thermal efficiency. The air temperature for the Arctic route selected is colder than that of the seawater, opening the opportunity of having air as coolant. This paper explores the use of two different coolants, air and seawater, for an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) unit using the available waste heat in the scavenge air system of a container ship navigating in Arctic Circle. Using a two-step single objective optimisation process, detailed models of air and seawater heat exchangers are evaluated as the WHRS condensers. The results suggest that an ORC unit using R1233zd(E) as its working fluid coupled with seawater as its coolant is the preferable option to reduce CO2 emissions. Using the ambient air as the coolant while a less effective option could be cheaper to install. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Arctic shipping; CO2 emissions; Condensers; Organic Rankine cycle; Waste heat recovery","Air navigation; Capacitors; Carbon dioxide; Condensers (liquefiers); Containers; Coolants; Sea ice; Seawater; Ships; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Arctic shipping; CO2 emissions; Lower temperatures; Organic Rankine Cycle(ORC); Organic Rankine cycles; Temperature increase; Thermal efficiency; Waste heat recovery systems; Rankine cycle; air temperature; ambient air; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; container ship; instrumentation; recovery; seawater; shipping; thermodynamics; Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030678487

UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectra (DRS) revealed that CDs/TiO2/g-C3N4 showed obvious additional absorption in the 370-450 nm region. DMPO spin-trapping ESR spectra demonstrated the existence of O2- and ·OH. The photocatalytic activity of the CDs (1.0 wt%)/TiO2/g-C3N4 was remarkably enhanced as compared to that of the single components (TiO2 and g-C3N4) and double component (TiO2/g-C3N4) towards the degradation of enrofloxacin (ENX) under visible-light irradiation. About 91.6% of ENX was decomposed by CDs (1.0 wt%)/TiO2/g-C3N4 in 1 h, which is nearly 3.95 times, 4.82 times, and 1.69 times that for TiO2, g-C3N4, and TiO2 (90.0 wt%)/g-C3N4, respectively. Scavenging experiments revealed that O2- and ·OH played key roles during the photocatalytic degradation of ENX.

It lacks conventional energy resources and is alternative energy disadvantaged. In the past decade (2000–2010), its energy-related carbon emissions increased from 37.8 to 44.4 million tonnes of CO2. This paper analyses the city state's carbon emissions from the demand perspective using the input-output (I-O) method and investigate the drivers of emission changes using structural decomposition analysis (SDA). It is the first comprehensive analysis of Singapore's emissions using the I-O framework. The results obtained show that exports accounted for nearly two-thirds of its total emissions and growth in its emissions in the last decade was largely export-driven. Emissions increased as export-oriented industries and export volume expanded. Fuel switching and energy efficiency, however, helped to lower growth in emissions. Besides exports, household-related emissions accounted for about a quarter of Singapore's total emissions. The emissions related to different household groups remained fairly stable as increases in embodied (indirect) emissions were offset by decreases in direct emissions. The high-income household group registered the largest increase in direct emissions, while the middle-income household group registered the largest increase in embodied emissions.

Climate change threatens to further exacerbate this trend by increasing both the severity and duration of many natural hazards, ultimately leading to even greater costs in both human life and monetary resources. To prepare for these changes, a handful of local communities have integrated climate change into their Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) approved hazard mitigation plans. This paper analyzes 30 U.S. local hazard mitigation plans against a conceptual framework for how climate change could be integrated into the requirements specified in the FEMA Plan Review Crosswalk, a checklist used by FEMA to evaluate and approve local hazard mitigation plans. Results show that the majority (23/35) of communities are openly discussing how climate change could affect or already is affecting the occurrence of natural hazards. Additionally, over half also include hazard mitigation actions that are designed to be viable in a climate-altered future. These actions, however, represent only a small portion of the total actions proposed in the plans and are generally focused on researching, planning, and capacity building. In addition, few communities include a formal commitment to adapting to climate change or include clear mechanisms for integrating new climate information as it become available into plan revisions. In general, results from this analysis show that there is little consistency in how communities are integrating climate change into hazard planning. These findings point to both the nascence of this practice and the opportunity to develop more formalized guidance that can steer communities towards holistic integration of climate change into hazards planning. © 2017","Adaptation; Climate change; FEMA; Hazard mitigation; Planning",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021242335

With the initiative Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), the UN spearheaded an approach to valorize ecosystems for their sequestered organic carbon (OC) to protect them for the sake of mitigating global climate change. In Brazil, where large areas of intact forests abound, especially within the territories of indigenous people, REDD+ schemes are highly sought after but are often hard to establish due to the given uncertainties in carbon stock evaluation at greater soil depths, intercultural communication problems and power asymmetries. With permission from the Kayapo/Mekragnoti tribe, our interdisciplinary research team dug a 10.0 m soil profile under a pristine forest situated on their indigenous territory in Pará, Brazil. Our results show that by following the Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) guidelines of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), focusing on the first 0.3 m of soil only captures 21 % of the total soil OC present. Furthermore, only 51 % of soil OC was stored in the first metre, while 84 % of OC was captured if the sampling depth expanded to 3.0 m. This study notes that for adequate calculation and validation of stored soil OC, at least one real measurement (i.e., the Tier 3 approach) is needed to represent OC stocks in the subsoil. © 2017 Erdkunde, All Right Reserved.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; deforestation; environmental degradation; global climate; guideline; project management; sampling; soil carbon; soil depth; soil profile; tropical forest; United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change; Amazonia; Brazil; Para [Brazil]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030099661

This is because the free market generally ignores the existence of external costs. Pollution taxes and other flexible market instruments are being applied to internalize external costs of atmospheric emissions. Subsidies to renewable energy technologies are also being applied to internalize positive external benefits of renewables as these technologies have lower life-cycle emissions of classical pollutants and GHG emissions in comparison with fossil fuel based energy generation technologies. The paper applies “context-mechanism-outcome” (CMO) theoretical framework based on realistic evaluation theory for review and assessment of the level of internalization of externalities and their impact on atmospheric emissions of classical pollutants in Baltic States. The paper aims to compare external costs of atmospheric pollution and pollution taxes and other measures to internalize externalities in Baltic States and to relate them to the trends of emission of classical pollutants in these countries. The external costs of atmospheric pollution were compared in Baltic States together with atmospheric pollution taxes and other policy measures used to internalize external costs of atmospheric pollution in Baltic States. The analysis of trends of atmospheric pollution by classical pollutants in Baltic States indicated positive trends since 2004 in all analysed countries. Though review of internalization of externalities in Latvia indicated the lowest levels of external costs internalization in terms of pollution taxes, excise taxes and feed-in tariffs and subsidies from EU Structural Funds for renewables, the atmospheric emission reduction trends for classical pollutants are very favourable in Latvia except air pollution by ozone. This indicates that the degree of internalization of external costs related to specific pollutants does not necessary imply emission reduction of these pollutants as other factors as well as country context also play very important role and further investigations of this problem are necessary. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric emissions; Baltic States; Environmental taxes; External costs; Feed-in tariffs","Atmospheric spectra; Commerce; Cost reduction; Emission control; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Renewable energy resources; Taxation; Atmospheric emission; Baltic state; Environmental taxes; External costs; Feed-in tariff; Air pollution",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008157541

Around two thirds of the required CO2-reduction potential is thought to lie in urban areas. The city of Salzburg has realized a pilot project, which established an optimized energy concept for an inner-urban area, comprised of new building developments and renovations of the existing building stock (2009-2014). An innovative combination of district heating, solar power and a heat pump with a total solar fraction above 35% lead to a drastic reduction of primary energy demand in the area. Based on this experience and other case studies, the city of Salzburg began to highly prioritize the optimization of communities as a whole, rather than individual buildings. An analysis of current building stock and ownership structures led to renovation and modernization focus areas. The first project, which focused on one of those clusters, started in 2014 as a joint activity of the urban planning department, housing associations and the municipal utility. The gained experiences illustrated that, in addition to optimized technological solutions, merging energy and urban planning remains challenging. Creating a win:win solution for all concerned parties is essential for success. The city of Salzburg wants to successfully fulfill the goals of its Masterplan on Energy and Climate Protection, housing associations want the value of their investments to increase and tenants want to improve their quality of living and living conditions. Thus, aspects like design of the planning process, stakeholder involvement and the consideration of co-benefits become highly relevant.

Past studies demonstrate links between O3 exposure and health. However, knowledge gaps remain in our understanding concerning the impacts of climate change mitigation policies on O3 concentrations and health. Using a hybrid downscaling approach, we evaluated the separate impact of climate change and emission control policies on O3 levels and associated excess mortality in the US in the 2050s under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). We show that, by the 2050s, under RCP4.5, increased O3 levels due to combined climate change and emission control policies, could contribute to an increase of approximately 50 premature deaths annually nationwide in the US. The biggest impact, however, is seen under RCP8.5, where rises in O3 concentrations are expected to result in over 2,200 additional premature deaths annually. The largest increases in O3 are seen in RCP8.5 in the Northeast, the Southeast, the Central, and the West regions of the US.

We present molecular mechanisms underlying the significant difference of CO2 absorption rate based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations combined with metadynamics. Our calculations predict the free energy barrier for base-catalyzed CO2 hydration to be lower in aqueous AMP compared to DEEA. Further molecular analysis suggests that the difference in free energy barrier is largely attributed to entropic effects associated with reorganization of H2O molecules adjacent to the basic N site. Stronger hydrogen bonding of H2O with N of DEEA than AMP, in addition to the presence of bulky ethyl groups, suppresses the thermal rearrangement of adjacent H2O molecules, thereby leading to lower stability of the transition state involving OH- creation and CO2 polarization. Moreover, the hindered reorganization of adjacent H2O molecules is found to facilitate migration of OH- (created via proton abstraction by DEEA) away from the N site while suppressing CO2 approach. This leads us to speculate that catalyzed CO2 hydration in aqueous DEEA may involve OH- migration through multiple hydrogen-bonded H2O molecules prior to reaction with CO2, whereas in aqueous AMP it seems to preferentially follow the one H2O-mediated mechanism. This study highlights the importance of entropic effects in determining both mechanisms and rates of CO2 absorption into aqueous sterically hindered amines. © 2017 the Owner Societies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038443367

The purpose of this paper is to answer the influence of EU regulations on exporting decisions of UK manufacturing small- and medium-sized firms (SMEs) by investigating the home and host country-based motivators behind SMEs’ choice to export, and export regionally, within the EU. Design/methodology/approach: Contrasting the Uppsala and resource-based view perspectives (using a sample of UK independent manufacturing SMEs and utilizing a survey, correlation analysis and factor analysis), the paper finds and describes the effect of the most recurrent motivators from the literature on the SMEs’ decision to export within the EU or not. Findings: The paper finds that SMEs whose latest international market entry was not in the EU scored significantly higher in the factor scorings for the motivators in the external dimension than participants whose latest entry was in the EU. Several motivators show an association with the choice to export per se. The importance of regionalization to export initiation (and EU membership) within the EU is emphasized in the results. Research limitations/implications: The sample size is limited. Practical implications: In the current climate, how can SMEs reduce market research costs for managers by relying solely and proactively on home country and internal advantages and motivators and being more aware of their surroundings? Managers and policymakers can direct their strategy, resources and policy more efficiently according to motivators; internal home country motivators (e.g. strengths of prices of products) direct the SME to overcome inter-regional liability of foreignness, while host country motivators (e.g. legal restrictions in the host country) direct them to regional ventures. Originality/value: The theoretical and empirical work on the topic, until recently, has been fragmented and inconsistent focusing on specific motivators but not necessarily justifying the selection or origin of variables even less on SMEs. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Export; Manufacturing; Motivation; Resource-based theory; Small- and medium-sized enterprises; UK",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008319910

Nonetheless urban public transport has become more important. Its main advantage is the number of simultaneously transported people. This not only reduces the amount of greenhouse gases emitted, but also puts fewer passenger cars on the roads. The use of public transport is thus ecological and improves the flow of traffic in major cities. Metropolises today utilize comprehensive urban transport systems which combine metro, trams, trolleybuses and buses. In smaller cities, where the cost of building a subway is uneconomical, the main means of transport become trams. Ostrava is also an example of such a city. The tram, as each rail vehicle, generates vibrations in the surrounding rock mass that are significantly larger than those due to the passage of motor vehicles. This article deals with the seismic measurement and analysis of vibrations from passing trams across the city with different geological structure of the subsoil and dynamic influence of the tram on the surrounding buildings.

Over time in Ostrava there has been a decline in mining activity. But closed coal mine may be performed in the correct disposal of heavy burden on their surroundings. One of the biggest dangers are the outputs of mine gases. If gas leaks into a confined space, there is an accumulation of gas and may result in an explosion. The article presents two cases of methane explosions, which were noticed in the Ostrava-Karvina coalfield. Such an explosion had a devastating effect especially due to the immediate blast effects. The adverse effects transmitted to the wider neighbourhood by seismic waves propagating through the ground. Also the article presents a study of seismic load in the near zone of the experimental methane explosion in building. In an experimental explosion on test subjects it was found that these adverse effects in the form of vibrations are not completely negligible, whereby the explosion in their characteristics resemble the effects of blasting work. So not only the pressure wave but also the vibration caused by the explosion can cause damage to not only the object itself, giving rise to an explosion, but also to objects in the vicinity. © SGEM2017.","Methane explosion; Mine gas; Seismic measurement","Coal deposits; Coal industry; Coal mines; Gases; Methane; Seismology; Adverse effect; Devastating effects; Experimental explosions; Methane explosions; Mine gas; Mining activities; Pressure waves; Seismic measurements; Explosions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032468521

Further studies at low exposure levels have also been called for. We analyzed two Swedish cohorts to investigate the effects of total and source-specific particulate matter (PM) on incident cardiovascular disease for different time windows of exposure. Methods Two cohorts initially recruited to study predictors of cardiovascular disease (the PPS cohort and the GOT-MONICA cohort) were followed from 1990 to 2011. We collected data on residential addresses and assigned each individual yearly total and source-specific PM and Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) exposures based on dispersion models. Using multivariable Cox regression models with time-dependent exposure, we studied the association between three different time windows (lag 0, lag 1–5, and exposure at study start) of residential PM and NOx exposure, and incidence of ischemic heart disease, stroke, heart failure and atrial fibrillation. Results and discussion During the study period, there were 2266 new-onset cases of ischemic heart disease, 1391 of stroke, 925 of heart failure and 1712 of atrial fibrillation. The majority of cases were in the PPS cohort, where participants were older. Exposure levels during the study period were moderate (median: 13 µg/m3 for PM10 and 9 µg/m3 for PM2.5), and similar in both cohorts. Road traffic and residential heating were the largest local sources of PM air pollution, and long distance transportation the largest PM source in total. In the PPS cohort, there were positive associations between PM in the last five years and both ischemic heart disease (HR: 1.24 [95% CI: 0.98–1.59] per 10 µg/m3 of PM10, and HR: 1.38 [95% CI: 1.08–1.77] per 5 µg/m3 of PM2.5) and heart failure. In the GOT-MONICA cohort, there were positive but generally non-significant associations between PM and stroke (HR: 1.48 [95% CI: 0.88–2.49] per 10 µg/m3 of PM10, and HR: 1.50 [95% CI: 0.90–2.51] per 5 µg/m3 of PM2.5, in the last five years). Effect estimates were stronger for women, non-smokers, and higher socioeconomic classes. Exposure in the last five years seemed to be more strongly associated with outcomes than other exposure time windows. Associations between source-specific PM air pollution and outcomes were mixed and generally weak. High correlations between the main pollutants limited the use of multi-pollutant models. Conclusions The main PM air pollutants were associated with ischemic heart disease and stroke (in women) at the relatively low exposure levels in Gothenburg, Sweden. The associations tended to be stronger for women than for men, for non-smokers than for smokers, and for higher socioeconomic classes than for lower. The associations could not be attributed to a specific PM source or type, and differed somewhat between the two cohorts. The results of this study confirm that further efforts to reduce air pollution exposure should be undertaken in Sweden to reduce the negative health effects in the general population. © 2017 The Authors","Air pollution; Cardiovascular disease; Cohort studies; Ischemic heart disease; Particulate matter","nitrogen oxide; particulate matter; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; cohort analysis; disease incidence; long-term change; morbidity; mortality; nitrogen oxides; particulate matter; pollution exposure; road traffic; adult; age; aged; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; atrial fibrillation; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; cause of death; cerebrovascular accident; diastolic blood pressure; female; gender; heart failure; human; hypercholesterolemia; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; long term exposure; major clinical study; male; morbidity; outcome assessment; particulate matter; physical activity; priority journal; questionnaire; smoking; smoking habit; social class; Sweden; traffic and transport; Cardiovascular Diseases; chemically induced; cohort analysis; environmental exposure; incidence; middle aged; risk factor; season; toxicity; young adult; Goteborg; Sweden; Vastra Gotaland; Adult; Aged; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Incidence; Male; Middle Aged; Particulate Matter; Risk Factors; Seasons; Sweden; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020474755

However, environmental and genetic variation across heterogeneous landscapes can lead to intraspecific differences in the partitioning of CO2-induced carbon gains to reproductive tissue relative to growth. METHODS: We measured the effects of rising atmospheric CO2 on biomass allocation in the allergenic plant Ambrosia artemisiifolia (common ragweed) across a geographic climate gradient. We grew plants from three latitudes at 400, 600, and 800 μL·L−1 CO2 and analyzed biomass allocation and natural selection on flowering phenology and growth. KEY RESULTS: Both the latitude of origin and CO2 treatment had significant effects on allocation and on estimates of selection. Northern plants were under stronger selection than southern plants to flower quickly, and they produced larger seeds and more reproductive mass per unit of growth. Northern plants were under stronger selection than southern plants to flower quickly, and they produced larger seeds and more reproductive mass per unit of growth. While all plants grew larger and produced heavier seeds at higher CO2, only northern plants increased male flower production. Both size and time to flowering were under selection, with a relaxation of the size–fitness function in northern ecotypes at high CO2. CONCLUSIONS: Northern ecotypes allocate more CO2-induced carbon gains to reproduction than do southern plants, pointing to a geographic gradient in future pollen and seed production by this species arising from local adaptation.

The goal of this study was to identify suitable co-firing ratios during co-combustion of straw and three different coal types (0, 10, 25, 40, 60, 100% straw on energy basis in fuel blend) minimizing the corrosion risk. An online corrosion monitoring systems based on the linear polarisation resistance method has been used for measurements in two pulverised fuel co-firing systems: An externally heated entrained flow reactor at the Technical University of Munich and a 300 kWth drop down fired reactor at University of Stuttgart. The experiments at the entrained flow reactor have been conducted for 8 h per blend at 1200 °C with an excess oxygen of 3-5 vol-%. Online corrosion measurements were performed at a flue gas temperature of about 700 °C-900 °C representing the superheater region of a power plant. Material temperature was set to 530 °C utilizing 10CrMo9-10 as the examined alloy. The pilot scale tests were performed for 0, 25, 40, 60% e.b. straw content. Each blend was combusted for 24 hours. At lab scale tests a constant sensor signal was measured for 0, 10, 25, 40% e.b. straw content which increased steeply after changing the ratio to 60%, indicating a corrosive atmosphere. This phenomenon was found for all three different coals, however the overall corrosion signal was lower for coal from South Africa and El Cerrejon. Nevertheless, all series of measurements showed an increasing signal for a higher share of straw in the fired fuel blend. These tendencies were also confirmed at the pilot scale test with El Cerrejon coal. Deposition and fuel analysis show correlations between the Cl-content in fly ash, Al2O3 content in the fuel and the corrosion signal. © 2017 The Authors.

We compare variability arising from these decisions to the uncertainty in future climate change itself. We also test whether certain choices offer improved skill for extrapolating to a changed climate and whether internal cross-validation skill indicates extrapolative skill. We compared projected vulnerability for 29 wetland-dependent bird species breeding in the climatically dynamic Prairie Pothole Region, USA. For each species we built 1,080 SDMs to represent a unique combination of: future climate, class of climate covariates, collinearity level, and thresholding procedure. We examined the variation in projected vulnerability attributed to each uncertainty source. To assess extrapolation skill under a changed climate, we compared model predictions with observations from historic drought years. Uncertainty in projected vulnerability was substantial, and the largest source was that of future climate change. Large uncertainty was also attributed to climate covariate class with hydrological covariates projecting half the range loss of bioclimatic covariates or other summaries of temperature and precipitation. We found that choices based on performance in cross-validation improved skill in extrapolation. Qualitative rankings were also highly uncertain. Given uncertainty in projected vulnerability and resulting uncertainty in rankings used for conservation prioritization, a number of considerations appear critical for using bioclimatic SDMs to inform climate change mitigation strategies. Our results emphasize explicitly selecting climate summaries that most closely represent processes likely to underlie ecological response to climate change. For example, hydrological covariates projected substantially reduced vulnerability, highlighting the importance of considering whether water availability may be a more proximal driver than precipitation. However, because cross-validation results were correlated with extrapolation results, the use of cross-validation performance metrics to guide modeling choices where knowledge is limited was supported. © 2017 Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","Bioclimatic species distribution models; Climate change vulnerability; Climate covariates; Collinearity; General circulation models; Prairie Pothole Region; Projection uncertainty; Thresholds; Wetland-dependent birds",,Article in Press,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030179150

To facilitate this in regards to the aerodynamics of a vehicle, virtual design methods such as CFD are often used to compliment experiments to help reduce physical testing time and costs. Once validated against experiments, CFD models can then act as predictive models to help speed development. In this paper, a wind tunnel experiment of a Class 8 truck is compared to a CFD simulation which replicates said experiment, validating the CFD model as a predictive tool in this instance. CFD is then used to evaluate the drag and flow around the vehicle in an open road scenario, and the results between the open road and wind tunnel scenarios are compared. Overall, experimentation is used to validate the CFD model, while the CFD model is then used to explore the differences between flows observed in the wind tunnel and an open road condition. Blockage is a significant factor in the difference between these results, and the drag varies significantly between the open road and wind tunnel simulations. The empirical blockage correction as applied to the experimental results is brought into question due to spatial variation of pressure along the vehicle, which may affect the measured impact of localized design changes. Secondary flows were observed to be qualitatively consistent between the wind tunnel and open road scenarios with a few exceptions due to the blockage and lack of moving ground in the wind tunnel experiment.

The South West Carbon Capture and Storage Hub in Western Australia is one of these projects, and is a greenfield investigation with little pre-existing subsurface data available to perform the required geological characterisation; thus acquiring geoscience data for the site has been a concentrated effort during the past several years. Research into the South West Hub project has focussed on acquiring and interpreting appropriate data to progressively refine the storage concept, and better understand and reduce uncertainties associated with the geological character of the storage site. The initial consideration for the South West Hub was to inject CO2 into Triassic sandstones in the southern Perth Basin at 2 to 3 km depth near a structural feature known as the Harvey Ridge. In this concept containment of the CO2 was mainly through residual trapping within these deposits. Research is now focussing on the recognition of potential for a multi-containment system being present in the Triassic Lesueur Formation that includes the lower Wonnerup Member and upper Yalgorup Member. Injection would be into sandstones of the Wonnerup in which residual trapping can occur; the overlying Yalgorup potentially represents a series of strata that may impede upward migration of fluids, and comprises a succession of heterogeneous strata including a series of bands or pods of fine-grained and low permeability palaeosols which are up to 200 m thick beneath a sequence of interbedded clay-rich beds. 3D seismic data obtained in 2014 have provided more clarity around subsurface structures, fault locations, orientations and insight into regional stress fields. Core and log data from three wells drilled in 2015 into the Yalgorup are helping to establish the depositional nature, stratigraphic correlation and regional continuity of the possible baffle units within this member. Core-based work on pore-scale processes is developing knowledge about the impacts of CO2 injected into Wonnerup sandstones and how it may be distributed and retained for long-term storage. Together the seismic and well data are being integrated toward more detailed static and dynamic models for simulations of trapping potential and long-term behaviour of injected CO2. Monitoring methods are being examined and field tested to establish environmental baselines and to ensure the ability to validate models and for public and regulatory assurance. Ongoing phases of research will continue to focus on reducing technical uncertainty at the South West Hub storage site. Addressing several outstanding questions about injectivity and containment at the site are driving additional research involving in situ well tests. © 2017 The Authors.","Geosequestration; Integration; Site Characterization; South West Hub; Uncertainty Reduction","Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Characterization; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Integration; Sandstone; Seismology; Stratigraphy; Well testing; Geo sequestrations; Regional stress field; Site characterization; South West Hub; Static and dynamic models; Stratigraphic correlation; Subsurface structures; Uncertainty reduction; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029652730

There is a need for structural health monitoring systems and non-destructive inspection methods. However, damages are hard to detect. When ceramic matrix composites, in this case carbon fibre reinforced silicon carbide (C/C-SiC), are used as a TPS, the electrical properties of the present semiconductor material can be used for health monitoring, since the resistivity changes with damage, strain and temperature. In this work the electrical resistivity as a function of the material temperature and tensile stress is analysed. A sensor network is applied for locally and time resolved monitoring of the 300 mm × 120 mm × 3 mm panel shaped samples. Since the material is used for atmospheric re-entry it needs to be characterised for a wide range of temperatures up to 2000 °C. Therefore, experiments in an inductively heated test bench were conducted.

In the gas refinery, tail gas in sulfur recovery unit is a main source of CO2 emission and the natural gas to flare is also a source of CH4 and CO2. In the present investigation, main aspects of Fischer-Tropsch Synthesis (FTS), e.g., catalyst, mechanism of process, operating condition, and reactor design have been considered and optimal condition selected to produce high quality production. In catalyst aspect, effects of K, Ce, Zn, Cs, and Rb promoters on the structure and catalytic behavior of precipitated Fe-Mn catalyst were investigated in a fixed-bed reactor. The effects of promoter on Fischer-Tropsch iron catalysts caused an increased growth probability of hydrocarbon chains from 0.67 to 0.75 for K to Rb promoter, and the olefin/paraffin ratios increased from 0.99 to 1.36 for Rb to K-promoted catalyst. The effect on the olefin selectivity was certainly due to increased adsorption strength of CO causing an enhanced displacement of olefin. The K selected as a promoter for Fe-Mn catalyst. In kinetic aspect, based on the H-unassisted pathways and the hypothesis that water inhibits the intrinsic FT reaction rate in the iron FT synthesis, the kinetic results demonstrated that a rate expression is discernable from a mechanistically that assumes the following kinetically relevant steps in the iron FT synthesis: CO dissociation is reversible and does not include hydrogen.

Here we explore the effect of plant community composition and diversity on fine root production in surface soils and plant biomass allocation to fine roots in six perennial cropping systems differing in composition and diversity planted as biofuel feedstocks. The six systems were established in 2008 at both a high and a moderate fertility site located in the upper Midwest, USA and included: switchgrass (Panicum virgatum), miscanthus (Miscanthus × giganteus), hybrid poplar (Populus nigra × P. maximowiczii ‘NM6), native grasses (a five-species assemblage of Andropogon gerardii, Elymus canadensis, P. virgatum, Schizachrium scoparium, and Sorghastrum nutans), an early successional system, and a restored prairie with 25 sown grass, legume, and forb species. For three years (2011–2013) at both sites ingrowth cores were deployed each spring; half were extracted at mid-season and the rest in late fall. Native grasses and restored prairie systems produced 31–77% more fine roots by mid-season compared to the other cropping systems at both sites. Miscanthus and hybrid poplars tended to have the lowest fine root production. The polyculture cropping systems allocated 39–94% more energy to the production of fine roots, with the exception of switchgrass at the low fertility site. Findings demonstrate a greater potential for diverse biofuel cropping systems to allocate C belowground to fine roots as compared to monocultures, with potential implications for soil C sequestration. © 2017 The Authors","Belowground primary production; Fine root production; Perennial bioenergy crops; Plant carbon allocation","Biofuels; Crops; Forestry; Plants (botany); Restoration; Soils; Bioenergy crops; Biofuel feedstocks; Biomass allocation; Carbon allocation; Early-successional; Fine roots; Perennial cropping system; Primary production; Biomass; bioenergy; biofuel; biomass allocation; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; community composition; cropping practice; fine root; grass; hybrid; plant community; primary production; soil carbon; Midwest; United States; Andropogon gerardii; Elymus canadensis; Miscanthus; Miscanthus x giganteus; Panicum virgatum; Poaceae; Populus; Populus nigra; Sorghastrum nutans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024835430

Continued development of this burgeoning industry relies upon the long-term availability of plentiful, sustainable sources of biomass. In the Midwest United States, efforts to secure such supplies have focused on herbaceous plants, either from the seeds or residues of annual crops or from perennial lignocellulosic species. Here, we explore the potential for this region to provide woody biomass from forests and short rotation woody crops (SRWC). We compare estimates of current and future availability—as defined by biophysical, technical, or economic potential—from four United States governmental entities. We find that estimates vary widely due to key parameter choices and assumptions, from current annual potential of 19.9–47.6 Mg (Mg, or metric ton) and future (year 2030) potential of 8.1–210.5 Mg. For the largest future estimate, the economic woody biomass potential from SRWC is triple that of forests. To complement these detailed assessments of flows, we introduce a comparison with biomass stocks to assess the long term sustainability of biomass extraction. We find that the average biomass growth rate of Midwestern forests (3.4%) is lower than estimated extraction rates when prices are high (3.7%) and even less sustainable for specific states, such as Minnesota (2.4% growth compared to 8.6% extraction). We recommend that future studies of biomass potential should (1) estimate stocks and flows all three categories (biophysical, technical, and economic) side-by-side, (2) improve the transparency of parameter assumptions, and (3) make models and methods available to the public so that readjustments of parameters can be tested and harmonized. The potential quantities and spatial distribution of the biomass potentials shown here can provide the basis both for planning of regional bioenergy production and for future work that explores the ecosystem services provided by agroforestry ecosystems. © 2017 The Authors","Bioenergy; Forest residues; Potential resources; Short rotation woody crops; Sustainability; Woody biomass","Bioeconomy; Climate change; Crops; Ecosystems; Extraction; Forestry; Plants (botany); Seed; Sustainable development; Bio-energy; Forest residue; Potential resources; Short-rotation woody crops; Woody biomass; Biomass; agroforestry; bioenergy; biomass; climate change; crop rotation; economic development; ecosystem service; growth rate; herb; plant residue; rural development; spatial distribution; sustainability; Midwest; Minnesota; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026384010

Further, as buildings are among the largest energy consumers in cities, the estimates are important for formulating effective energy conservation strategies. Where complex hourly simulation models are not favored, such estimates may be derived by simplified methods that are less computationally intensive but still provide results that are reasonably close to those obtained from the more complicated approach. The equivalent full load hours (EFLH) method is a simplified energy estimation method that has recently gained popularity. It offers a straightforward means of evaluating energy efficiency programs. However, to date, easily accessible EFLH data exist only for a very limited number of countries in North America and Europe, but not Asia. This current work provides previously unavailable monthly EFLH data for building cooling and heating in three large Asian cities, viz. Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo. To assess the effects of changing temperature over the course of decades on building cooling and heating energy consumption, EFLH data are calculated for three time periods: past (1983–2005), present (2006–2014) and future (2015–2044). The projections for the future time period are based on the climate scenarios Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5 of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report. RCP-4.5 assumes a stabilization of future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions followed by a reduction, while RCP-8.5 assumes their further increase. From the EFLH data, considering just the effects of ambient temperature changes, it is projected the total energy required to heat and/or cool residential dwellings in Hong Kong, Seoul and Tokyo to increase by 18.3%, 4% and 10.4%, respectively over 62 years from 1983 to 2044 in the case of RCP-4.5, and by 23.3%, 9.3% and 15.8%, respectively in the case of RCP-8.5. This shows that even with future stabilization and reduction of GHG emissions, as per scenario RCP-4.5, the energy needs of the three cities for building heating and cooling combined can be expected to increase over the next few decades. This has significant implications, namely increased demands for additional primary energy, which will result in further GHG emissions. These effects, however, can be controlled with adjustments to the electricity fuel mix of each location, and also by use of more efficient heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC) devices. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Appliance energy efficiency; Building energy requirements; Climate change; Cooling and heating loads; Heating ventilating and air conditioning systems","Air conditioning; Cooling systems; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Estimation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Historic preservation; Housing; Stabilization; Ambient temperature change; Building energy; Energy efficiency programs; Heating energy consumption; Heating load; Heating ventilating and air-conditioning systems; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Ventilation and air conditioning; Climate change; air conditioning; building; climate change; cooling; energy efficiency; energy use; equipment; estimation method; greenhouse gas; heating; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; ventilation; China; Europe; Hong Kong; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; North America; Seoul [Seoul (ADS)]; Seoul [South Korea]; South Korea; Tokyo [Kanto]; Tokyo [Tokyo (PRF)]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85007107464

This method allows obtaining high gaseous pollutant removal efficiency at relatively low investment and operating costs. Evaluating the efficiency of a biofilter using dynamic olfactometry is a very useful tool because it allows determining the degree of total deodorization efficiency. Determining the concentrations of individual pollutants does not always give an overall assessment of the degree of olfactory pollution by the gases being emitted, and at the same may not be sufficient in the case of evaluating the efficiency of a deodorization installation. The paper presents the results of the evaluation of biofilter efficiency performed based on olfactometric determinations. The measurements were conducted for biofilter-treated gases emitted from various sources within four municipal waste processing plants. Obtained results indicated the biofiltration efficiency between 60.8 and 97.2% and showed that after the filter bed replacing (organic instead of mineral bed) deodorization efficiency significantly increased. An important aspect of the overall evaluation was the evaluation of odor hedonic quality, due to the frequently intense natural odor of the biofilter bed itself.",,"Biofilters; Biofiltration; Fog; Odor control; Odors; Operating costs; Pollution; Quality control; Dynamic olfactometry; Gaseous pollutants; Hedonic quality; Municipal waste; Odor emission; Odorous gas; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041671401

A number of biotic and abiotic factors have been proposed as drivers of geographic variation in species richness. As biotic elements, inter-specific interactions are the most widely recognized. Among abiotic factors, in particular for plants, climate and topographic variables as well as their historical variation have been correlated with species richness and endemism. In this study, we determine the extent to which the species richness and endemism of monocot geophyte species in Mesoamerica is predicted by current climate, historical climate stability and topography. Methods. Using approximately 2,650 occurrence points representing 507 geophyte taxa, species richness (SR) and weighted endemism (WE) were estimated at a geographic scale using grids of 0.5 × 0.5 decimal degrees resolution using Mexico as the geographic extent. SR and WE were also estimated using species distributions inferred from ecological niche modeling for species with at least five spatially unique occurrence points. Current climate, current to Last Glacial Maximum temperature, precipitation stability and topographic features were used as predictor variables on multiple spatial regression analyses (i.e., spatial autoregressive models, SAR) using the estimates of SR and WE as response variables. The standardized coefficients of the predictor variables that were significant in the regression models were utilized to understand the observed patterns of species richness and endemism. Results. Our estimates of SR and WE based on direct occurrence data and distribution modeling generally yielded similar results, though estimates based on ecological niche modeling indicated broader distribution areas for SR and WE than when species richness was directly estimated using georeferenced coordinates. The SR and WE of monocot geophytes were highest along the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, in both cases with higher levels in the central area of this mountain chain. Richness and endemism were also elevated in the southern regions of the Sierra Madre Oriental and Occidental mountain ranges, and in the Tehuacán Valley. Some areas of the Sierra Madre del Sur and Sierra Madre Oriental had high levels of WE, though they are not the areas with the highest SR. The spatial regressions suggest that SR is mostly influenced by current climate, whereas endemism is mainly affected by topography and precipitation stability. Conclusions. Both methods (direct occurrence data and ecological niche modeling) used to estimate SR and WE in this study yielded similar results and detected a key area that should be considered in plant conservation strategies: the central region of the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Our results also corroborated that species richness is more closely correlated with current climate factors while endemism is related to differences in topography and to changes in precipitation levels compared to the LGM climatic conditions. © 2017 Sosa and Loera.","Diversity patterns; Ecological niche modeling; Endemism; Spatial regression model; Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt","case report; climate; ecological niche; geophyte; human; last glacial maximum; Mexico; monocot; nonhuman; precipitation; predictor variable; response variable; spatial regression; species distribution; species richness; topography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031750263

For many years along the coast of the United States, acidic precipitation values have been measured. Studies on the Mexican coast have recorded the presence of acid rain since 2003. In relation to acid rain, pH determination is essential, in addition to the composition of sulfate and nitrate that are formed from its main precursors, sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, respectively. The aim of this study was to evaluate pH, sulfate and nitrate concentrations in wet atmospheric deposition, collected daily from 2003 to 2015 in a sampling site located along the coast of Mexico (La Mancha) and compare the values with the National Atmospheric Deposition Program (NADP) sampling sites located along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico from Texas to Florida. The HYSPLIT back trajectory model was applied in order to identify the emission sources of acid rain precursors. Trajectories showed an important transport to the sampling site from the East during the rainy season (June-October). The region located east to ""La Mancha"" is the Gulf of Mexico representing offshore operations for the exploration and production of petroleum. The annual VWM pH in wet deposition at ""La Mancha"" sampling site was in the range of 4.81 to 5.40 during the study period (2003-2015). For the year 2015, the pH was 5.22, which is similar for the USA sites. Additionally, the annual VWM concentration of SO42- was in the range of 15 to 31 μeq/L, and for the last year was 26.87 μeq/L, which is similar than the higher level registered in the USA (TX03 site); the annual VWM concentration of NO3- was in the range of 3.5 to 15 μeq/L and for 2015 was 5.48 μeq/L, which is lower than in the USA sites. The ratio SO42-/NO3- found for the site in Mexico in 2015 was 4.90, being the highest value compared to other sites on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico whose ratios were between 1.03 and 2.38. Therefore, it is important to consider the sulfur dioxide emission sources in Mexico. It is also recommended to extend the atmospheric deposition sampling to other sites in the Gulf of Mexico, like Mexico and Cuba.","Acid rain; Atmospheric deposition; Gulf of Mexico; Nitrate; Sulfate",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039152267

This work aims to study the impact of the maritime and harbour activities of the Port of Leixões (one of the biggest port in Portugal) on the air quality over the urban area around. For that, all emissions sources were inventoried with high spatial and temporal detail and its impact on air quality evaluated using the local scale numerical model VADIS, which allow the simulation of the atmospheric flow and air pollutants dispersion in the study area. The detail of the emission inventory was of extreme importance to properly assess the impacts of the port activity. This task involved a detailed compilation and estimation of the emission factors and activity data regarding the vessel types. The air quality modelling results indicate that the harbour activities can have a high contribution to the PM concentrations on the surrounding urban area. In the hours with more ship traffic, the PM concentrations can increase up to 50%.

Large volumes of flue gases and dust are continuously and constantly released into the atmosphere through exhaust chimneys of heat treatment facilities. As a result, righteously, these plants are considered to be major stationary sources of anthropogenic emissions, which according to Law 278/2013 must be monitored. In this respect, given the importance of actions to reduce pollution at national level, traders producing ceramic building materials are bound by the environmental permit to monitor gas concentrations in effluents, through discontinuous measurement. This paper presents the assessment of environmental impact generated by production of ceramic building materials and its effects on the local population. Depending on the specific production processes, plants manufacturing ceramic products cause emissions that are discharged into air, water and soil (waste). Type and amount of air pollution depend on different parameters, such as raw materials being used, auxiliaries, fuels and production methods. The trader where emission measurements were taken gas used mari clay and fire clay as stock for manufacturing bricks, tiles and other construction products and the fuel used in thermal process is natural gas. This paper is a summary of a scientific study based on the European Directive 2010/75/EU and Law 278/2013 on industrial emissions that refer to limiting greenhouse gas emissions into the environment. © SRAC - Societatea Romana Pentru Asigurarea Calitatii.

While the academic literature has traditionally focused more on correlating built environment factors (i.e. urban density, trip distance, etc.) and production of CO2in the transport sector, only limited attention has been paid to the influence of lifestyle factors. This paper examines the effects of lifestyle and built environments factors on transport CO2emissions generated by the daily commutes to and from the Autonomous University of Barcelona (UAB) in Greater Barcelona (Spain). The analysis revealed that lifestyle choices were as relevant as the built environment for understanding the emitting sources and CO2volume. Accordingly, the study provides insights how the design of efficient transport policy packages can integrate lifestyle factors as a central focal point. © 2017, Universitat Politecnica de Catalunya.

At present, China's biomass densified solid fuel (BSDF) development lags behind previously planned target, main barriers of which are economic and policy support problems. Accurate case studies are key to analyze these problems. This manuscript takes Nong'an County in Jilin Province of China as an example to establish a techno-economic model to evaluate the economic performance of a CSDF-DHS under two policy scenarios. It calculates the economic performance under a benchmark market scenario (BMS) and the current policy scenario (CPS) and analyzes the influence of various policy instruments, including subsidies, carbon trading, and preferential taxation. The results indicate that: (1) The CSDF-DHS option is not competitive under the BMS or CPS compared to the traditional energy system based mainly on coal and liquefied petroleum gas; (2) Comparatively, the economic performance of corn straw briquette fuel (CSBF) is better than that of corn straw pellet fuel (CSPF); and (3) further policy support can make CSDF-DHSs competitive in the market, especially with subsidies for concentrated heating services and CSDF, carbon trading, and economic compensation to reduce the profit margin of enterprises, which can make both CSPF-DHSs and CSBF-DHSs competitive. The research results could provide scientific basis for relevant policy making and project decision.","Corn straw; District heating system; Economic model; Policy influence; Solid densified fuel",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85009241630

In this study, we analyzed the patterns of boundary layer CO2 flux and concentration for a residential neighborhood in Phoenix, Arizona by using the eddy covariance technique and a single column atmospheric model. Atmospheric stability, anthropogenic emission, and biogenic effect are found to be key determinants to atmospheric CO2 variability. In a diurnal cycle, two CO2 flux peaks coincide with morning and afternoon peak traffic hours, exemplifying the influence of traffic emissions. In the annual cycle, maximum CO2 concentration is found in winter, mainly due to additional emission from the combustion of natural gas combined with the effect of poor dispersion. On the other hand, the minimum CO2 concentration is found in the spring and is attributable to the strong convective mixing and active vegetation uptake. In addition, prominent hysteresis has been found between the atmospheric CO2 concentration and air temperature with a “plait-shaped” pattern in the diurnal cycle and an “oval-shaped” loop for the seasonal variability. © 2017.

The PM2.5mass concentrations from 1382 national air quality monitoring stations in 367 cities, between January 2014 and December 2016, were analyzed to estimate the health burden attributable to ambient PM2.5across China. The integrated exposure-response model was applied to estimate the relative risks of disease-specific mortality. Disease-specific mortality baselines in province-level administrative units were adjusted by the national mortality baseline to better reveal the spatial inequality of the health burden associated with PM2.5. Our study suggested that PM2.5in 2015 contributed as much as 40.3% to total stroke deaths, 33.1% to acute lower respiratory infection (ALRI, &lt;5yr) deaths, 26.8% to ischemic heart disease (IHD) deaths, 23.9% to lung cancer (LC) deaths, 18.7% to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) deaths, 30.2% to total deaths combining IHD, stroke, COPD, and LC, 15.5% to all cause deaths.

Reuse and recycling is a preferred option as much as it is applicable. A new strategy is proposed and analysed compared to the current state. Presently the waste treatment is a key information for effectivity assessment of a newly designed system. The known parameters are usually: production (sources) and processing (sinks) of given combustible waste in specific territory unit (node) from considered area and transportation between these nodes. For real life data analysis, available information is production and different ways of treatment (according to the waste hierarchy). Transportation between the nodes is not always evident, which can lead to a lack of knowledge of the total cost and expenses for individual producers. To gather information, it is necessary to obtain and assess available data. This research presents a tool for pre-processed data where the potential for combustible waste suitable for energy recovery and/or recycling in pre-defined nodes is determined. The tool is based on the reverse logistic problem, which is a specific case of supply chain model. The objective is to optimise the system of network flow of unusable products from the producer to the treatment facility. It describes an approach to determine the flow of the network with the utilisation of uncertainties, arising from incomplete or unknown information. Decision-making is done in relation to transportation distance criterion. This criterion naturally prefers closer treatment facilities instead of more distant. In order to reflect the uncertainty in the decision-making process, a probability function that links preferences for the particular type of waste is implemented. Developed mathematical model gives an estimation of mean value for a decision variable (potential for energy recovery) and also provides additional information about variability for each node. As a result of this analysis, an assessment creates a distribution function for the amount of waste for specific processing in particular node. The potential for energy recovery depends on the amount of combustible waste, which is currently landfilled and not used for recycling. These data outputs are further used for prognosis and form the necessary foundation for the planning of future treatment facilities. This tool has been tested through a case study involving the particular stream of combustible waste (network with 206 nodes). It has been found that it is suitable for various applications. The results of the optimisation can also provide a guidance for GHG (greenhouse gas) footprint reduction.

However, the narrow operating range of LTC engines limits the use of these engines in conventional powertrains. In range extenders, the engine is decoupled from the drivetrain, which allows the engine to operate in a limited operating range; thus, range extenders offer an ideal application for realizing the advantages of LTC engines. In this study, the optimum fuel consumption improvement of an experimentally developed 2-l multi-mode LTC-SI range extender is investigated in a light-duty battery electric vehicle (BEV) platform. In the optimization framework, the mode-switching fuel penalty, exhaust aftertreatment catalyst light-off temperature, and engine noise, vibration, harshness (NVH) are considered. The engine operation modes include HCCI, RCCI, and conventional spark ignition (SI). The simulation results show in the city driving cycle, the single-mode HCCI and RCCI range extenders offer 11.0% and 5.4% fuel consumption improvement, respectively over a single-mode SI range extender. These improvements increase to 12.1% and 9.1% in the highway driving cycles. In the multi-mode operation, up to 1.4% higher fuel economy is achieved over different driving cycles, compared to single-mode HCCI/RCCI operation. As the driving cycle average demanded power increases, the contribution of the RCCI mode predominates the HCCI mode. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle; HCCI; High efficiency engines; LTC engines; Range extender; RCCI","Battery electric vehicles; Combustion; Electric vehicles; Engines; Fuel economy; Fuels; Powertrains; Temperature; Vehicles; HCCI; High-efficiency engines; Homogeneous charge compression ignition; In-cylinder combustion; Light-off temperatures; Low temperature combustion; Range extenders; RCCI; Ignition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022175945

Three types of fuels were used: a natural gas, a coal derived synthetic kerosene and Jet-A as a reference fuel. The alternative fuels are Fischer-Tropsch process fuels. Synthetic fuels are attractive in the aviation industry because of their potential for reducing energy dependence and the growing need for higher efficiencies, while reducing emissions. The research SR-30 gas turbine was used to evaluate combustion noise from the selected fuels. The turbine can operate at a maximum speed of 80,000 rpm, produce a maximum thrust of 40 lbf, has a pressure ratio of 3.4 to 1, and a specific fuel consumption of 1.22 lbfuel/thrust per hour. The measurement transducers were state of the art Brüel &amp; Kjaer 1/4 inch microphone and a triaxial accelerometer which were interfaced with the analysis software, Brüel &amp; Kjaer Pulse 21. Data was taken at 70,000 rpm for a time span of five minutes at stabilized conditions. One-third octave analysis indicated highest sound difference between the fuels at 400 Hz, and a more pure sound level was obtained. The difference for Jet A was as much as 6 dBA higher for exhaust measurement at 400 Hz, and for FT-NG the exhaust had a higher decibel reading from the exhaust side by as much as 4.4 dBA at the 400 Hz frequency, and FT-CG had as much as 7.3 dBA difference at 315 Hz. The sound from the combustion of these fuels produced the differences of sound when the positions of the microphones changed. However, with this new introduction of sound measurement locations and angles, the combustion differences are still distinct and show a more in depth view of the sound quality that is being received by the microphone.

It means buildings have to reduce the energy consumption of fossil fuel and take action to use clean energy such as wind energy. The higher altitude, the higher wind speed. Wind speed as a function of altitude has a chance to be used in highrise buildings. Indonesia is a humid tropical country, which generally has the character of relatively low wind speeds. In another hand, high-rise buildings have considerable potential value to utilize height as a factor to obtain sufficient wind speed. This study aims to identify the potential for wind energy in high-rise buildings in humid tropical climate. Problems focused on the design arrangement of wind turbine type on the building and the potential energy can be harnessed. This research was conducted in suburban areas where the roughness level is lower than the city centre. This study focused on assessing the potential of the wind on tall buildings in a built environment in suburban areas. The research method is quantitative research which the variable is observed from wind speed data. Research developed by the experimental research method with CFD simulation to meet the built environment wind profile for further analysis. The variable data is observed from field measurement and local wind speed data.

To this aim, the study realized in the paper was carried out in two directions: firstly, we analyze the evolution of GDP in the EU countries, and secondly, we analyze the influence of final energy consumption (FEC) on GDP of each EU country. For this we collect the information provided by Eurostat for the period 2006-2016 for the 28 EU states members on the evolution of macroeconomic indicators: GDP and FEC (nominal and on capita). We analyze these series of data using the EViews 9 econometric software package. The Dickey-Fuller and Philips-Perron unit roots tests and the Granger causality standard test were applied to examine the relationship between GDP and FEC at both nominal and per capita. The results of the analysis did not indicate a cointegration relationship between the studied variables, but this can be considered as a positive element, because the reduction of the final energy consumption can lead to the reduction of the gas emissions, which can have a beneficial effect on the economic development and implicitly of living standards. However, in developing countries there is still the possibility of increasing FEC leading to GDP growth, and positive shocks in GDP per capita cause positive shocks in the FEC. © 2017 International Business Information Management Association, IBIMA.

Climate models are the only tool which is able to produce physical-based projections of future changes in response to increasing greenhouse gas emissions. In the present study, the Western Iberian offshore wind resource is analysed for present and future climates, using a set of regional climate models (RCMs) simulations produced in the framework of the CORDEX experiment at 0.11° resolution (∼12 km), and a regional climate simulation produced with the WRF model at higher resolution (9 km). All these simulations are firstly, evaluated against wind buoy measurements and Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) wind data, and used to generate two high quality multi-model ensembles based on the individual model's performance. The results of the WRF simulation and of the two multi-model ensembles are then used to describe the wind resource both for the present and future climates, according to the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 emission scenarios. This allows the assessment of the climate change signal on the offshore wind and to provide an uncertainty measure of these projections. The vast majority of climate models project reductions of wind speed and wind power for all seasons, with the exception of summer. For the RCP8.5 emission scenario the multi-model ensembles project reductions in power density of around 7% for winter, 4% for spring and 12% for autumn, and increases of 5% for summer. In the latter, and increase up to 20% in power density is forecasted for the Iberian northwest coast. This is sufficient to offset the yearly balance, in as much as no change is expected at a yearly scale for this area. For the remaining west Iberian coast, a yearly reduction of less than 5% is estimated. These results are shared by the two multi-model ensembles and by WRF higher resolution simulation (9 km). The projected changes have the consequence of reducing the annual cycle of power density availability and of its yearly mean values. Finally, for the less aggressive scenario, RCP4.5, the changes have the same signal but with smaller values. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; EURO-CORDEX; Multi-model ensembles; Regional climate modelling; Wind power; WRF","Climate models; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Wind power; EURO-CORDEX; Individual modeling; Multi-model ensemble; Offshore wind resources; Regional climate modelling; Regional climate models; Regional climate simulation; Uncertainty measures; Climate change; buoy system; climate change; climate modeling; ensemble forecasting; future prospect; global warming; model test; offshore structure; performance assessment; regional climate; wind power; Atlantic Ocean; Iberian Shelf",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020937159

Specifically, the EPA intends on reducing fugitive methane and VOC emissions from new and modified oil and natural gas production well sites. Wellhead Emissions Management Systems, LLC of Houston, Texas has a developed a patent pending approach for the remediation of Methane and VOC emissions for gas production wellheads at a significantly lower cost than currently estimated by the EPA. Per the EPA - Regulatory Analysis Engineering Compliance Cost Estimates, the second most expensive item to comply with under the proposed regulation is fugitive emissions. The 2020 capital cost of compliance is estimated to range from $15MUSD to $22M increasing to $95M to $140M by 2025. The annualized cost of compliance is estimated to be between $29M and $47M swelling to $180M to $290M by 2025. Additional annual cost compliance estimates developed by the EPA state the cost to control wellhead fugitive emissions to be $310MUSD or $2,237 per well per year. Industry estimates for compliance have placed the cost at 0.65 cents per 1,000 SCF of gas produced.

The one with potential is biogas. It is the product of natural fermentation processes of municipal waste in landfills or is produced in biogas plants out of agricultural and green waste. Due to creation under different conditions, its chemical composition varies. This is enormous obstacle in its effective application. Biogas is easily applied to fuel spark-ignition engines however intensive attempts are made to employ it in much more effective compression-ignition engines. Application of biogas require the use of dual-fuel CI engine. The point of the research described in this paper is to show the influence of different methane-carbon dioxide composition ratio in biogas on dual-fuel CI engine effectiveness. 1© 2017 Michał Śmieja, Sławomir Wierzbicki.

Birch seedlings from 10 populations were therefore transplanted to 3 northern Fennoscandian sites (1 oceanic, 1 continental mountain and 1 Arctic coastal site). Annual measurements were carried out on growth parameters and phenology (date of budbreak) from 1992 onwards. At the coastal site, measurements covered the whole period 1993 to 2010, while at the 2 other sites measurements covered only the period 1993 to 1997 (mountain site) and 2010 to 2014 (both sites). During the last period (2010 to 2014), measurements were made on a new set of seedlings, transplanted in 2002. The plants suffered a temporary transplantation stress because of root damage. In general, budburst occurred earlier in populations from northern and continental sites than from southern and coastal sites. Survival rates were dependent on climate and were generally higher at the oceanic than at the mountain site, due to more autumn frost and insect damage at the latter. At the mountain site, survival rates were lowest in oceanic and southern populations; at the Arctic site, survival rates were lowest in continental populations; while at the oceanic site, only small differences were found between populations. The present results seem to indicate that climate is an important driver of change at the mountain birch treeline, although land-use changes may be more important in the short term. In the future, when a warmer climate is predicted, plants that are adapted to a coastal climate may expand their range, and increased winter temperatures are expected to favour insect-resistant polycormic birch inbreeding with dwarf birch Betula nana. © The authors 2017.","Climate change; Dieback; Height and diameter growth; Survival; Treelines","bioclimatology; bioindicator; climate change; climate effect; deciduous tree; dieback; growth rate; land use change; measurement method; mountain region; parameterization; phenology; pleochroism; seedling; survival; Fennoscandia; Betula nana; Betula pubescens; Betula pubescens subsp. tortuosa; Hexapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028942510

Nonetheless, projections of precipitation change vary considerably at the regional scale between climate models. Here, it is shown that the response of plant physiology to elevated CO2, or CO2 physiological forcing drives widespread hydrologic changes distinct from those associated with CO2 radiative forcing and has a role in shaping regional-scale differences in projected daily-scale precipitation changes. In a suite of simulations with the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4), reduced stomatal conductance from projected physiological forcing drives large decreases in transpiration and changes the distribution of daily-scale precipitation within and adjacent to regions of dense vegetation and climatologically high transpiration. When atmospheric conditions are marginally favorable for precipitation, reduced transpiration dries the boundary layer and increases the likelihood of dry day occurrence. In CCSM4, the annual number of dry days increases by upward of 15 days yr-1 over tropical land and the continental midlatitudes. Decreases in transpiration from physiological forcing also increase the number of heavy precipitation events by up to 8 days yr-1 in many tropical forest regions. Despite reductions in the land surface contribution to atmospheric moisture, diminished surface latent heat fluxes warm the forest boundary layer and increase moisture convergence from nearby oceans, enhancing instability. The results suggest that consideration of the radiative impacts of CO2 alone cannot account for projected regional-scale differences in daily precipitation changes, and that CO2 physiological forcing may contribute to differences in projected precipitation characteristics among climate models. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Atmosphere-land interaction; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Evapotranspiration; Precipitation; Vegetation","Atmospheric boundary layer; Atmospheric radiation; Boundary layers; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Climate models; Electric power system interconnection; Evapotranspiration; Forestry; Moisture; Physiology; Precipitation (chemical); Precipitation (meteorology); Scale (deposits); Transpiration; Vegetation; Atmosphere-land interactions; Atmospheric conditions; Community climate system model; Daily precipitations; Precipitation change; Precipitation characteristics; Stomatal conductance; Surface latent heat fluxes; Physiological models; atmospheric moisture; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate modeling; evapotranspiration; hydrological change; latent heat flux; precipitation (climatology); radiative forcing; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015935568

This article provides a timely examination of EU emission legislation policy design and policy interaction within the European Union with the aim of explaining why the EU policy framework failed to regulate the regional automotive industry. Current research is mostly concerned with the typology and effectiveness of individual environmental policy instruments, be it regulatory or economic incentives, that aim to influence industry behaviour.

The emission spectra of individual mPSIIcc are dominated by sharp zero-phonon lines, showing the existence of different emitters compatible with the F685, F689, and F695 bands reported formerly. The intensity of F695 is reduced in single mPSIIcc as compared to single PSIIcc-dimers (dPSIIcc). Crystal structures show that one of the β-carotene (β-Car) cofactors located at the monomer-monomer interface in dPSIIcc is missing in mPSIIcc. This β-Car in dPSIIcc is in van der Waals distance to chlorophyll (Chl) 17 in the CP47 subunit. We suggest that this Chl contributes to the F695 emitter. A loss of β-Car cofactors in mPSIIcc preparations will lead to an increased lifetime of the triplet state of Chl 17, which can explain the reduced singlet emission of F695 as observed in SMS. © 2017 the Owner Societies.",,"beta carotene; carotenoid; chlorophyll; chemistry; cyanobacterium; metabolism; photosystem II; spectrofluorometry; beta Carotene; Carotenoids; Chlorophyll; Cyanobacteria; Photosystem II Protein Complex; Spectrometry, Fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85024499819

Predicting the potential effects of climate change on tea crops prompts the use of statistical models to measure how the crop responds to climate variables. The statistical model was trained on historical tea yields, and how they related to past data on maximum temperature, minimum temperature and precipitation over Nandi East Sub-County. Scatter diagrams for selected months were generated from tea yield and temperature data. A multiple linear model was developed to predict tea yield using climatic variables. A contingency table was used to verify the model. Results from an analysis of trends in rainfall depicted a positive trend and revealed an increased frequency of annual droughts. The study showed that the frequency of extreme rainfall events during September-October-November (SON) season has decreased. Results from an analysis of the trends in temperature revealed that the minimum temperatures are increasing and that the frequency of extreme events has increased. Rising maximum temperatures were observed in March. The study revealed that May, the cold month, is becoming warmer. Correlation analysis indicated that the climatic variables during some months in both the concurrent year and the previous year were positively correlated with the tea yield. However, there was an inverse relationship between maximum temperature and rainfall. Results of model verification revealed that that 70% of model forecasts were correct. The results also showed that at least half of the observed events were correctly forecasted and thus the majority of the forecasts were true.

A well-prepared SUMP will help to provide high-quality and sustainable mobility and transport to, through and within urban areas. SUMPs foster a balanced development of all transport modes, while encouraging a shift towards more sustainable modes and usage. The plans present both long-term strategies for the future development of transport and mobility infrastructure and services in urban areas as well as short-term plans for implementation of these strategies: Timing, allocation of resources and responsibilities and identifying the required finances. They include integrated sets of technical, infrastructure, policy-based and soft measures. Different approaches to sustainable urban mobility planning exist throughout Europe. While some countries, such as France and the UK, may be considered forerunners (with plans produced under a different name and slightly different methodology), SUMPs are a new planning tool in other parts of the EU, especially within the new member states.

The engine construction permits illumination of the sprays by a thin sheet of laser light from a pulsed Nd:YAG laser frequency tripled to operate at the ultraviolet wavelength of 355 nm. The liquid fuel was decane with TMPD-naphthalene dopant dispersed in it. After ultraviolet excitation by the pulsed laser, liquid fuel regions fluoresced with a spectrum centered at the wavelength of 380 nm, while vapor regions fluoresced with a spectrum centered at 470 nm. This approach, called Exciplex technique, was applied to permit simultaneous acquisition of the liquid and vapor fuel regions in the cup-in-head geometry of the combustion chamber. The results from limited conditions suggest that existence of the pilot injection affects the chamber flow field, particularly in the near-wall region, in such a way that less liquid fuel accumulation occurs with pilot injection scheme thus should reduce hydrocarbon emission. The area spreading rate of both vapor and liquid phases within the visualization plane were linear in early stages with former having a higher rate. Close to the impingement time, vapor phase area penetration is reduced to near zero, while liquid continues linearly but at slower rate than its initial value. Both air utilization and evaporization are therefore reduced. Also, based on this and work by others, the suggestion is made that to achieve optimum simultaneous reduction in soot and NOx, the timing between the pilot and main injections (dwell) should be chosen with due consideration of the interaction between the swirl flow and pilot spray and the relative magnitudes of the ignition delay period with respect to the dwell. © 2017 by Begell House, Inc.",,"Engines; Flight control systems; Image acquisition; Laser excitation; Liquid fuels; Liquids; Naphthalene; Neodymium lasers; Ultraviolet lasers; Visualization; Yttrium aluminum garnet; Dual injection system; Hydrocarbon emission; Laser induced fluorescence; Simultaneous acquisition; Simultaneous reduction; Two dimensional images; Ultra violet excitation; Ultraviolet wavelength; Pulsed lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045892605

Proper inventory of forest aboveground biomass (AGB) is required for accounting carbon emissions that forms the most vital part of the carbon cycle modeling and climate change mitigation programs in context to Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD). Remote Sensing (RS) technology provides cost and time effective means for accurate temporal monitoring over large synoptic extents at local to global levels, and hence, is beneficial over conventional methods. The study presents a suitable approach for estimating AGB through the synergic use of multi-frequency X-, C- and L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data over tropical deciduous mixed forests of Munger (Bihar, India). Backscatter values generated from the raw SAR images were correlated with field-based AGB values and then regressed to generate best-fit models for AGB estimates with single and combined frequencies of COSMO-Skymed (X-band), Radarsat-2 (C-band) and ALOS PALSAR (L-band). Among all the models for AGB estimation, the integrated model involving X, C- and L-bands showed the best results with r2=0.95, RMSE=14.81 t/ha and Willmott's index of agreement of 0.95. Resulting modeled AGB were converted to carbon (C) and carbon dioxide (CO2) equivalents using conversion factors. Hence, the study proposed L-band for single frequency analysis and the combination of X-, C- and L-bands for multi-frequency analysis for tropical forest AGB and C estimation. The study revealed information regarding the spatial distribution and quantification of forest AGB and C required for REDD monitoring.","Alos palsar; Biomass; COSMO-skymed; Forest; Radarsat-2","Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Deforestation; Emission control; Frequency estimation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Space applications; Space optics; Space-based radar; Synthetic aperture radar; ALOS PALSAR; Climate change mitigation; Cosmo skymed; Forest; Greenhouse gas inventory; L-band synthetic aperture radars; Radarsat-2; Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD); Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047383561

These are neighbourhoods and homes protected because of their architectural and historic importance. This means that property alterations are limited and require permission from local authorities. The paradox lies in the fact that most of these are occupied and highly energy inefficient, and therefore require significant refurbishment if the UK carbon emission targets are to be met. In this study, the authors have used a Victorian house located in a conservation zone in Nottingham, UK, as a vehicle to explore means of improving comfort and therefore energy efficiency, working within the constraints of the property protection system. The study was broadly divided into three cases: pre-base case (past - Victorian time conditions), base case (present - current conditions) and proposed case (future - after proposed improvements). The methods included qualitative studies consisting of understanding Victorian house design and comfort and quantitative studies covering lighting, ventilation, air quality and thermal comfort. The findings suggest that the house performed better in the pre-base case than in the base case. However, with proposed step-wise improvements of the thermal envelope the house can perform better without significant alterations to the exterior envelope.

Intrinsic properties of particulates are direct function of sources. This initiates the necessity of conducting a comprehensive review on PM2.5sources over South Asia which in turn may be valuable to develop strategies for emission control. Particulate source apportionment (SA) through receptor models is one of the existing tool to quantify contribution of particulate sources. Review of 51 SA studies were performed of which 48 (94%) were appeared within a span of 2007–2016. Almost half of SA studies (55%) were found concentrated over few typical urban stations (Delhi, Dhaka, Mumbai, Agra and Lahore). Due to lack of local particulate source profile and emission inventory, positive matrix factorization and principal component analysis (62% of studies) were the primary choices, followed by chemical mass balance (CMB, 18%). Metallic species were most regularly used as source tracers while use of organic molecular markers and gas-to-particle conversion were minimum. Among all the SA sites, vehicular emissions (mean ± sd: 37 ± 20%) emerged as most dominating PM2.5source followed by industrial emissions (23 ± 16%), secondary aerosols (22 ± 12%) and natural sources (20 ± 15%). Vehicular emissions (39 ± 24%) also identified as dominating source for highly polluted sites (PM2.5&gt;100 μgm−3, n = 15) while site specific influence of either or in combination of industrial, secondary aerosols and natural sources were recognized. Source specific trends were considerably varied in terms of region and seasonality. Both natural and industrial sources were most influential over Pakistan and Afghanistan while over Indo-Gangetic plain, vehicular, natural and industrial emissions appeared dominant. Influence of vehicular emission was found single dominating source over southern part while over Bangladesh, both vehicular, biomass burning and industrial sources were significant. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Aerosol; Biomass burning; Indo-Gangetic plain; Receptor model; South Asia","Aerosols; Chemical analysis; Emission control; Factorization; Food supply; Biomass-burning; Chemical mass balance; Emission inventories; Indo-Gangetic Plains; Positive Matrix Factorization; Receptor model; Source apportionment; South Asia; Particles (particulate matter); aerosol; biomass burning; industrial emission; meta-analysis; modeling; particulate matter; source apportionment; traffic emission; Afghanistan; air pollution; air pollution control; airborne particle; Article; Bangladesh; Bhutan; biomass; biomass burning; environmental aspects and related phenomena; exhaust gas; food security; geographic distribution; health hazard; human; India; industrial emission; Maldives; Nepal; nonhuman; Pakistan; particulate matter; positive matrix factorization; principal component analysis; seasonal variation; secondary organic aerosol; source apportionment; South Asia; Sri Lanka; statistical analysis; urban area; aerosol; air pollutant; analysis; Asia; environmental monitoring; industrial waste; meta analysis; particulate matter; theoretical model; Afghanistan; Agra; Bangladesh; Delhi; Dhaka [Bangladesh]; Dhaka [Dhaka (ADS)]; Gangetic Plain; India; Lahore; Maharashtra; Mumbai; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]; Uttar Pradesh; aerosol; air pollutant; exhaust gas; industrial waste; particulate matter; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Asia; Bangladesh; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Industrial Waste; Models, Theoretical; Pakistan; Particulate Matter; Principal Component Analysis; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008465298

Based on statistically robust significance tests, we unravel several likely changes in the pattern of the dust load and rainfall over the South Asia under different future warming scenarios by the end of 21st century compared to the historical period. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test results reveal a significant change (at 5% significance level) in the amount of dust and rainfall under different warming scenarios over the study region. Northern part of the Indian subcontinent is likely to witness increased dust loading in future, and regions with increase in dust load are also likely to be the regions of increased rainfall over North India. Positive correlation between rainfall over the Indian region and dust over the Arabian region is also likely to strengthen in future. Considerable changes in the spatial correlation pattern between dust and rainfall are noted under different representative concentration pathways; however, no noteworthy changes are recorded in their temporal relationship. Notable intermodel differences in the patterns of dust load and rainfall relationship over South Asia are possibly caused by variations in the dust emission schemes among the CMIP5 models as well as the parameterization of aerosol indirect effect in addition to the differences in the meteorology simulated by various models under identical forcing scenarios. © 2017.

Emission control measures at a central generating plant may be more effective and less costly than treating the emissions of widely dispersed vehicles. Where low emissions sources are available like: aeolian, water, solar, and nitrogen byproducts; net production of pollutants can be reduced.

One of the factors strongly contributing to these heightened levels of tropospheric ozone is the oxidation of nitrogen monoxide due to volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Among the VOCs, the biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) isoprene plays a central role: It forms high quantities of reactive oxygen compounds which in turn can directly lead to higher ozone concentrations. This contribution presents the introduction of an isoprene-emission model into the microclimate model ENVI-met. To simulate the effects of isoprene onto the formation of tropospheric ozone on a microscale level, both the plant-based emissions of isoprene and the chemical reactions induced by this isoprene are incorporated into the microclimate model. Based on the implementation of the isoprene-emission model of Guentheret al. (1993) into ENVI-met, a simplified isoprene-oxidation scheme is developed and introduced into ENVI-met's chemistry model. The advancements include the reactions leading to an increase of tropospheric ozone due to the emission of isoprene. The validity of the implementations is then evaluated in proof-of-concept simulations that examine the isoprene-emission model as well as the advancements in the chemistry model under different chemical and meteorological conditions.

Malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever, meningitis, leishmaniosis, and different forms of diarrheal diseases are the most common climate sensitive diseases. The Health Vulnerability Index (HVI) assessment is adopted from Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI-IPCC). It considers the three IPCC contributing factors to vulnerability: exposure, adaptive capacity, and sensitivity as major factors along the nine profiles/determinants using secondary data from published documents. The values for the exposure levels ranged from 0.12 to 0.69 and grouped the regions into moderately exposed and highly exposed regions to climate change. All regions are found highly sensitive to climate change induced diseases with the exception of Addis Ababa. Adaptive capacity measured in terms of several socio-economic factors such as finance, infrastructure, available health professionals and social determinants of health reveals variation between regions characterized as urban and the rest. HVI values range from less vulnerable (−0.247) to highly vulnerable (0.279). The analysis categorized regions into relatively least vulnerable (0.6%), moderately vulnerable (49.95%), highly vulnerable (10.35%) and very high vulnerable (39.5%) of the total land mass. Health adaptation strategies recommended include improved public health surveillance systems; establishing health and climate data management system; strengthening early warning systems; improved public health services; improved water, sanitation, and hygiene system; human resource development; enhanced public awareness and attitudes; targeted intervention to regional contexts by enhanced financial resources. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Adaptation; Climate change; Ethiopia; Exposure; Health vulnerability; Sensitivity",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071512147

While the Government’s green economy strategy targets the financial opportunities and sustainability co-benefits of low emissions development, the climate resilient strategy focuses on managing risk and building resilience to shocks brought about by climate change. The effectiveness of these national policy processes in directing the delivery of climate finance are assessed through the use of a principles, criteria and indicators (PCI) analytical framework. The four principles of policy development considered relevant to the effective delivery of climate change finance are ease of implementation, legitimacy, coherence and transparency. The analyses of effectiveness suggest the main policy instrument, the CRGE strategy, has been well designed for ease of implementation, with coherence across the two main elements of the strategy (mitigation and adaptation). The mitigation (or green economy) element began earlier and has been influential in informing the overall growth trajectory that aims to secure for Ethiopia middle income status by 2025 in a carbon neutral way. The more recent adaptation (or climate resilience) part of the strategy has now been prepared for the agriculture, forestry, water and energy sectors. This demonstrates effective sector prioritisation so as to secure the livelihoods of those most vulnerable to climate change. Two areas are identified where further effectiveness gains may be sought for enhancing adaptation.

Second, the present policy is silent on how it will promote transparency in climate finance delivery, which is a generally-held principle of public administration. Creating additional space for non-government actors (including micro and small business entrepreneurs and community leaders) to participate in policy influencing platforms and developing and subsequently publishing performance-based measures for the allocation of climate finance are recommended for more effective implementation of Ethiopia’s CRGE climate policy. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Climate policy; Coherence; Ease of implementation; Legitimacy; Transparency",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071417722

The Baltic Sea Region (BSR) has a great bioenergy potential worth exploring in this context. This paper explores the state-of-art of bioenergy systems and synergies with eco-systems services in the BSR region in the context of developing the region's bio-economy. In this brief assessment, we consider 8 countries (i.e. Sweden, Finland, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Denmark, and Belarus) in the region. While the production and use of modern bioenergy can help reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, promote energy security, diversify energy resources, and contribute to a successful circular economy and rural development, it is important to find a balance between the exploration of resources and the management of eco-systems services. In addition, both climate change vulnerability and bioenergy production may affect the environment and the capacity of the BSR to deliver ecosystem services (ESS). We recommend integrated strategies for optimal use of bioresources in the region. Bioeconomy can be realized by innovative approaches, establishing cross-cutting institutional and policy linkages for increased prosperity and green growth in the Baltic Sea Region. ©2017 The Authors.

BVOC are also precursors of secondary organic aerosols (BSOA) that absorb and scatter the atmospheric radiation, affect precipitations by acting as cloud condensation nuclei and affect human health. For these reasons, it is important to develop models able to estimate such emissions accurately. BVOC emissions depend on plant species distributions, emissions potentials and seasonal behaviour. This work presents a high-spatial (~1 km2) BVOC emission model based on an accurate recognition of plants over the Italian territory together with their measured basal emission potentials. The CORINE Land Cover (CLC) level IV dataset was used to identify the areas covered by agriculture, vegetation and forests. MODIS-based LAI data were used to derive the emissions’ seasonality for crops and deciduous trees (growing and the leaf-on seasons). BVOC emissions estimated by the developed model were compared with those provided by MEGAN model evidencing significant differences, particularly for isoprene. Such emissions were then used to fed a Chemical Transport Model (CTM) applied over the Vesuvius area, where different BVOC vertical profiles were measured by tethered balloon soundings. The comparison between observed and predicted BVOC concentrations evidenced the capability of the developed model to estimate the biogenic emissions and highlighted the necessity of an accurate inventory of the plants present in the investigated area. © 2018 Hungarian Meteorological Service.

Although the risk map methodology is general and may be used to assess leakage of either CO2 or brine, the degree to which risk may occur via plugged and abandoned (P&amp;A) brine leakage is arguably the most uncertain. This uncertainty stems from the possibility of a high number of undocumented wells at a given injection site which, even when properly plugged, may yield a number of different leakage pathways. Furthermore, determining the spatial extent and probability of brine leakage through P&amp;A wells is not straightforward. The aforementioned risk maps are probabilistic and are based on the premise that two of the greatest sources of uncertainty in brine leakage through P&amp;A wells are the location of the unknown well with respect to the injection well and the permeability of the leaky well (which can span over several orders of magnitude). The methodology utilizes either analytical solutions or numerical simulations in conjunction with probability theory to generate spatial distributions of risk. Risk is defined with either no-impact levels (i.e. zero brine concentration above background in the drinking water aquifer) or other user defined thresholds such as the secondary maximum contaminant level (SMCL) for total dissolved solids, a non-health related standard related to water hardness, color, and taste. These probabilistic maps can be used to provide risk-based descriptions of the injection area to inform site selection prior to injection and monitoring during or after injection has ceased, similar to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's definition of the area of review (AoR). However, unlike the AoR definition, we differentiate risks according to a tiered approach, where CO2 leakage risk and brine leakage risk through P&amp;A wells and open wellbores are assessed separately given that not only do the risks differ considerably, the spatial extents of each hazard do as well. A strength of this methodology is its demonstrated efficiency, which unlike computationally expensive Monte Carlo techniques that could require several thousands of simulations, requires only on the order of tens of simulations. Here, we assess the sensitivity of risk maps of a hypothetical, yet realistic GCS leakage scenario. In this sensitivity analysis, risk maps are generated with varying leaky well permeability distributions including differences in distribution modality and distribution variance. This work is motivated by the unknown quality to which many wells are sealed and/or the degree to which they degrade over time, in addition to the sheer unknown quantity of which P&amp;A wells may be present at a single Geologic Carbon Storage site. Quantitative probabilities of exceeding contamination thresholds in the USDW are used for discussion, a practical metric for decision-makers and stakeholders. Results show that the modality of the leaky P&amp;A distribution plays an important role in the risk profile and that larger variances in leaky P&amp;A well permeability distribution may result in an overall lower profile of risk, depending on the upper-threshold of the distribution. © 2017 The Authors.","brine leakage; carbon capture and storage; CO2 injection; geologic carbon storage; risk assessment; risk maps","Aquifers; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Environmental Protection Agency; Greenhouse gases; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Health risks; Injection (oil wells); Maps; Monte Carlo methods; Potable water; Probability; Probability distributions; Risk analysis; Risk perception; Risks; Sensitivity analysis; Site selection; Water hardness; Geologic carbon storages; Maximum contaminant levels; Permeability distribution; Probabilistic methodology; Risk maps; Sources of uncertainty; Total dissolved solids; United States environmental protection agency; Risk assessment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029653747

Air pollutant emission sources are generally required to obtain construction and operating permits from state or local air quality agencies, or directly from the U.S. EPA. Generally the issuing agency will provide an opportunity for a facility to review and comment on draft permit conditions. Taking advantage of that opportunity is essential to ensure the best permit that can be obtained. Particular permit conditions that may present problems are: poorly or inaccurately written conditions; inflexible conditions that do not provide for real world variations; emission limitations that cannot be routinely or consistently achieved in practice; monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting conditions that require excessive effort; and stack testing requirements that are of questionable value yet costly. These and others may require substantial effort, yet produce little environmental benefit. On the other hand, permitting agencies and environmental advocacy groups may perceive different problems with permit conditions. The panel will discuss alternative conditions and other remedies for problem permit conditions. Although modification of permit conditions is within the exclusive purview of the permitting agency, permitting agency personnel may have little familiarity with local issues or the difficulty of complying with some permit conditions.

Biogas can be produced by landfill gas (LG), or produced at sewage treatment plant, in anaerobic digestion of industrial, municipality and agricultural treatment. Biogas contains 50-70% methane and 30-50% carbon dioxide as well as small amounts of other gases, nevertheless, the quality of biogas composition is dependent on the substrate type and technology used. Thus, this paper reviews the methane yield from various feedstocks. Sewage sludge has shown positive methane yield, nevertheless its conversion may be optimized by applying co-digestion process with organic fraction municipality waste (OFMSW) as a co-substrate. Although pulp and paper mill sludge has high methane potential, the amount of methane yield is dependent on the pulp and paper process used and activated sludge plants (ASPs). Generally, methane yield from AD of slaughterhouse range between 160m3/ton kg VS- 500 m3/ton kg VS, depending on the amount of blood presented and processes used. © Copyright International Association of Engineers.","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Feedstock; Renewable energy","Activated sludge process; Biogas; Carbon dioxide; Feedstocks; Methane; Pulp; Renewable energy resources; Sewage sludge; Sewage treatment plants; Sludge digestion; Substrates; Activated sludge plants; Biogas composition; Biogas production; Energy and environment; Methane potential; Potential substrate; Pulp and paper mill sludge; Renewable energies; Anaerobic digestion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054910131

Improving the efficiencies of on-field rainwater collection and utilization is a critical approach to enhance crop productivity and water use efficiency (WUE) in semiarid Pakistan. In recent decades, an innovative micro-field rain-harvesting farming technology, ridge and furrow mulching (RFM) with plastic film, has been developed in the Loess Plateau of northwest China, leading to massive increases in grain yield and WUE in dryland crops. This farming technology has been widely adopted and extended in rainfed agricultural areas where small household farmers account for the majority of population. Semiarid Pakistan has similar climatic and socioeconomic conditions with Chinese Loess Plateau, displaying a great potential to extend such a low-cost but high-efficiency farming technology. In this review paper, we present the background and advantages of this rainfed farming system and its applicable potential in Pakistan. The opportunities and challenges during the extension of this farming strategy are also discussed. In view of our previous studies and local natural & socioeconomic data, we believe that the introduction of this farming technology into Pakistan may lead to an expected increase in food and forage production and ecosystem sustainability. This may provide promising strategies to cope with climate change for regional ranifed agricultural system. © 2017, Pakistan Botanical Society.

Flue gas moisture from fired power plant mainly comes from the release of hydrogen in coal combustion process and water carried by flue gas from wet flue gas desulfurization system. High humidity flue gas emission increases the overall humidity in the lower atmosphere, which is not conducive to the pollutants diffusion in low atmosphere and even affect the local climate around the plant; high humidity flue gas emission promotes the secondary transformation of air pollutants as well, accelerating the hygroscopic aerosol growth, thus aerosol optical characteristics is changed, and atmospheric visibility reduces. As for the power plant itself, high humidity flue gas emission will cause the increase of water consumption, and take away too much latent heat of vaporization, which is adverse to water conservation and heat reuse. High humidity flue gas and other acidic gases such as SO3cause low-temperature corrosion of flue at the end of boiler, shortening the operation span of equipment. High humidity flue gas also produces “gypsum rain” after the wet flue gas desulfurization, which is harmful to the surrounding environment. Through research and analysis for high humidity flue gas emission from domestic and foreign coal fired power plants, the authors believe that a significant increase in the relative humidity and a large number of sub-micron particles discharging due to high humidity flue gas emission throughout the lower atmosphere may contribute to continuous smog, thus the quantitative study about the contribution of high humidity to smog is the next focus for the research of high humidity flue gas emission. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental impact; Flue gas moisture; Relative humidity; Smog","Aerosols; Air pollution; Atmospheric corrosion; Boiler corrosion; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal fueled furnaces; Desulfurization; Environmental impact; Fire tube boilers; Flue gases; Flues; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Moisture; Smoke; Temperature; Water conservation; Aerosol optical characteristic; Environmental influences; Latent heat of vaporization; Low temperature corrosion; Secondary transformation; Smog; Surrounding environment; Wet flue gas desulfurization; Atmospheric humidity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010399949

Intensity-Duration-Frequency (IDF) curves represent essential means to study effects on the performance of drainage systems. Therefore, the need for updating IDF curves comes from the necessity to gain better understanding of climate change effects. The present paper explores an approach based on spatial downscaling-temporal disaggregation method (DDM) to develop future IDFs using stochastic weather generator, Long Ashton Research Station Weather Generator (LARS-WG) and the rainfall disaggregation tool, Hyetos. The work was carried out for the case of Bangkok, Thailand. The application of LARS-WG to project extreme rainfalls showed promising results and nine global climate models (GCMs) were used to estimate changes in IDF characteristics for future time periods of 2011-2030 and 2046-2065 under climate change scenarios. The IDFs derived from this approach were corrected using higher order equation to mitigate biases. IDFs from all GCMs showed increasing intensities in the future for all return periods. The work presented demonstrates the potential of this approach in projecting future climate scenarios for urban catchment where long term hourly rainfall data are not readily available. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Climate modelling; Intensity-Duration-Frequency; Rainfall disaggregation; Urban drainage","Catchments; Climate models; Rain; Stochastic systems; Climate change scenarios; Future climate scenarios; Higher order equations; Intensity duration frequencies; Intensity-duration-frequency curves; Rainfall disaggregation; Stochastic weather generator; Urban drainage; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; climate prediction; downscaling; drainage network; global climate; hydrometeorology; numerical method; precipitation assessment; rainfall; statistical concept; uncertainty analysis; urban drainage; Bangkok; Central Region [Thailand]; Krung Thep Mahanakhon; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013861868

Some fungal systems further contain and utilise dissimilatory (dNar) and assimilatory (aNar) nitrate reductases in order to denitrify nitrate. This system is localised in the mitochondria and functions during anaerobic respiration. Phylogenetic analysis of nirK genes showed that the fungal denitrifying system has the same ancestor as the bacterial counterpart and suggests the possibility of its proto-mitochondrial origin. Denitrifying fungi acquired a P450 from bacteria through horizontal gene transfer and modulated its function to give Nor activity (the origin of P450nor). P450nor receives electrons directly from NADH to reduce NO to N2O. The mechanism of this unprecedented electron transfer has been extensively studied and thoroughly elucidated. Fungal denitrification is often accompanied by a unique phenomenon, co-denitrification, in which a hybrid N2 or N2O species is formed upon the combination of the nitrogen atoms of nitrite with a nitrogen donor (amines and imines). Both NirK and P450nor are potentially involved. The contribution of fungal denitrification and co-denitrification to the nitrogen cycle in nature is also discussed. © The Royal Society of Chemistry 2017.",,"cytochrome P450; hemoprotein; NirK protein; nitrate reductase; nitric oxide reductase; nitrite reductase; nitrogen; nitrogen derivative; unclassified drug; ecosystem; electron transport; eukaryote; fungal metabolism; gene isolation; mitochondrion; nitrogen cycle; nonhuman; phylogenetic tree; protomitochondrion; reaction analysis",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006264118

Among the reasons are economic and financial crises followed by political chaos affecting socioeconomic and political settings, livelihood dependency, market pressure, and dramatic climate change and its impacts on local communities and the resources themselves. The haphazard use of the natural resource base in Asia challenges the sustainability of natural resources and poses serious environmental threats, particularly deforestation and forest degradation, biodiversity loss, and ecosystem degradation, reduction in soil quality, and fall in available water quantity. The decentralization and devolving of natural resource management (NRM) responsibilities and benefits to local stakeholders are echoing strongly in Asian nations. This introductory chapter highlights the importance of decentralization, collective actions, and community participation, particularly in forest management for greenhouse gases reduction. The country office of the Ford Foundation in Jakarta, Indonesia, funded a collaborative project between Andalas University and the Asian Institute of Technology with the main aim of capacity building of the Andalas faculty to understand theories and diverse policy arenas in managing common pool resources. The key lessons learned from the program are theoretical as well as methodological (ie, Institutional Analysis and Development and Social-Ecological System frameworks).

For such studies, the first step is to acquire 3D point clouds of urban form such as by airborne lidar sensors. There is a technical question in respect of pixel and object based building classification approaches on time series lidar data as to which approach is more appropriate for comparing volumetric indicators of 3D urban development sustainability over time. This paper aims to answer this question by comparing the results of building classification of bi-temporal airborne lidar datasets using Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithm and an object-based classification tool in ERDAS software. The results show that the omission errors for classified building points are not similar for the same buildings in the bi-temporal lidar data sets. This inconsistency affects the measurement of volumetric descriptors of 3D urban form over time. Therefore, two change detection methods of image differencing and SVM are also evaluated. While the level of noise in the SVM change detection results is lower than occurring in results derived by image differencing, the magnitude of change cannot be determined using SVM. Therefore, we conclude that a combination of change detection methods is preferred for spatio-temporal urban analyses. © 2017 The Authors.

However, studies assert that the usage of EV is currently limited mainly to short-distance trips and the users are only those who have the opportunity of charging their car privately at home or workplaces. This research highlights the lack of public charging stations and tries to develop a demand-oriented location model for finding the optimal location of fast charging stations (FCSs) from a user's point of view. In urban areas the users can make use of activity time of their daily routine activities such as supermarket shopping for charging the battery of their EVs. Therefore, the proposed location model focuses on the interaction between people's travel behaviour and urban infrastructure. First, the potential of a facility for installation of FCS is determined by means of its different attributes such as number of attracted motorized individual trips, opening hours and parking lot availability, activity time of users in different facilities in relation to the charging time and synergy effect of closely allied facilities. In the second step, the study area is zoned and the calculated potential for facilities is transferred to the relevant zones, considering users' maximum detour acceptance, catchment area of facilities as well as spatial impact of existing charging stations.

All measurements were performed in the “impact zone” of LAX with the predominant westerly winds from coast to inland. The overall impact of aircraft emissions from the LAX airport and its facilities in comparison to vehicular emissions from freeways on air quality was evaluated on a local scale (i.e. areas in the vicinity of the airport). PN concentration was, on average, 4.1 ± 1.2 times greater at the LAX site than on the studied freeways. Particle number emission factors for takeoffs and landings were comparable, with average values of 8.69×1015particles/kg fuel and 8.16×1015particles/kg fuel, respectively, and indicated a nearly 4-fold statistically significant reduction in PN emission factors for takeoffs during the past decade. BC emission factors were 0.12 ± 0.02 and 0.11 ± 0.01 g/kg fuel during takeoffs and landings, respectively. Additionally, the mean PM2.5emission factor values for takeoffs and landings were also comparable, with values of 0.38 ± 0.04 and 0.40 ± 0.05 g/kg fuel, respectively. Within the impact zone of the airport, an area of roughly 100 km2downwind of the LAX, measurements indicated that the LAX daily contributions to PN, BC, and PM2.5were approximately 11, 2.5, and 1.4 times greater than those from the three surrounding freeways.

However, controlling the physicochemical properties of metal oxides requires complex procedures with bulky setups that incur high costs and long processing times. Herein, we present a facile one-step manipulation of the reduced states of manganese oxides and the synthesis of carbon coatings surrounding them, using structure-guided combustion waves (SGCWs), which is induced by incomplete combustion through the chemical fuel-wrapped materials. Controlled oxygen release from MnO2 using SGCWs in air and in an Ar atmosphere enabled direct fabrication of reduced Mn2O3/Mn3O4/MnO and MnO, respectively. Furthermore, control of the incompletely combusted carbonaceous fuel facilitated the synthesis of carbon coating layers to form Mn2O3/Mn3O4/MnO@C and MnO@C. These core-shell nanostructures of reduced manganese oxides and carbon layers were applied as supercapacitor electrodes. These electrodes showed better specific capacitance (maximum 438 F g-1 at 10 mV s-1 scan rate for Mn2O3/Mn3O4/MnO@C) and improved stability in charge-discharge performance compared with bare MnO2, due to the carbon coatings enhancing electrical conductivity in the percolation network of electrodes and facilitating the reversible redox reaction without degradation during cycling operations. SGCWs are applicable for fast, low-cost, and large-scale fabrication of reduced metal oxides and organic material coatings, which could significantly contribute to electrochemical applications. © 2017 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Coatings; Combustion; Complex networks; Electric discharges; Electrodes; Manganese; Nanostructures; Oxides; Redox reactions; Solvents; Supercapacitor; Charge discharge performance; Core shell nano structures; Electrical conductivity; Electrochemical applications; Large-scale fabrication; Physicochemical property; Reversible redox reactions; Supercapacitor electrodes; Manganese oxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85022033902

To evaluate the effects of air pollution on respiratory diseases, many epidemiological studies were conducted, and the findings played an important role in the regulatory control of air pollution. After 1970, the concentration of SO2 has decreased markedly, and its adverse health effects have been minimized. On the other hand, the increasing automobile traffic in Japan has caused considerable increases in concentrations of air pollutants, such as nitrogen oxides (NOx) and particulate matter (PM). The large-scale epidemiological studies conducted in Japan showed that traffic-related air pollution was associated with the development of asthma in school children and the persistence of asthmatic symptoms in preschool children. In recent years, however, the concentrations of NOx and PM have gradually decreased, since control measures based on the Automobile NOx/PM law were enforced in 2001. At present, the adverse health effects of airborne fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and photochemical oxidants have become a major concern. These air pollutants consist of not only emissions from primary sources but also secondary formations in air, and have spread worldwide. Both short- and long-term exposure to these air pollutants are reported to increase the risk of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases in the population. Therefore, global efforts are necessary to reduce the health risk of these air pollutants.","automobile exhaust; bronchial asthma; fine particulate matter; photochemical oxidant; sulfur dioxide","air pollutant; exhaust gas; particulate matter; photochemical smog; pollutant; adverse effects; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; asthma; child; electric power plant; exhaust gas; female; health status; history; human; Japan; male; particulate matter; photochemical smog; pollutant; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Air Pollutants, Occupational; Air Pollution; Asthma; Child; Environmental Pollutants; Female; Health Status; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Japan; Male; Oxidants, Photochemical; Particulate Matter; Power Plants; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031692359

To avoid potential hazards of flame flash back, an inherently safe technique of rapidly mixed tubular flame has been adopted in this study, in which fuel and oxygen are individually injected into the cylindrical burner. The flame structure and stability were experimentally investigated under various equivalence ratios. Detailed observations show that a steady tubular flame can be established close to the lean extinction limit; however, as the equivalence ratio was raised, steady combustion evolved into periodic oscillations; around stoichiometry the flame became steady, and thereafter evolved into unsteady state in the rich condition. Based on pressure fluctuation measurements and frequency spectral analyses, high frequency (around 2000 Hz) combustion-driven oscillation was observed. Steady tubular flame has been attained at the stoichiometric condition. Through comparing with the stoichiometric methane/air flame, the methane/oxygen flame illustrates remarkable advantages. © 2017 Combustion Institute.

Power distribution and continuous fuel transportation to produce the electrical energy for these areas pretences a great challenge. A smart-grid hybrid energy system has been designed and simulated to support a small community considering an average load demand of 34 kWh/d and peak load of 4.6 kW. The total simulation and optimization process of the hybrid energy system have been done by HOMER Software with the meteorological data. The simulation results ensure that the proposed system is economically and environmentally feasible. The results show that Net Present Cost (NPC) and CO2 emission can be reduced about 29.65% per year compared to the conventional power plants. The NPC of the optimized system has been found about US$ 33,310.00 having the Cost of Energy (COE) about US$ 0.209/kWh. This analysed hybrid system will be applicable for similar meteorological and environmental conditions. This analysed hybrid system will be applicable for similar meteorological and environmental conditions. The urban area, including the central business district, are partially elevated by spurs of the Herbert Taylor Range, such as the summit of Mount Coot-tha, reaching up to 300 meters (980 ft) and the smaller Enoggera Hill, Brisbane, Australia. Using renewable energy resources in off grid hybrid energy system might be a solution of this issue. Moreover, high cost of renewable energy systems has led to its slow adoption in many countries. Hence, it is vital to select an appropriate size of the system in order to reduce the cost and excess energy produced as well as to maximize the available resources. Reduction of some greenhouse gasses as well as reduction of per unit cost according to the market price are main contribution of this research. The analysed hybrid solar-wind-diesel renewable energy system will be the most feasible and environment friendly in comparison with other traditional or conventional energysources in terms of reliability and cost effectiveness. © 2017 The Authors.","HOMER; Off-shore Area; Optimization; Renewable Energy; Sensitivity; Simulation; Solar Energy; Wind Energy","Carbon dioxide; Computer software; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Costs; Economic analysis; Electric power transmission networks; Energy resources; Hybrid systems; Meteorology; Optimization; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Wind power; HOMER; Off-shore; Renewable energies; Sensitivity; Simulation; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019560052

They (Cl, Br and I) have recently also been shown to impact the troposphere, notably by reducing the mixing ratios of O3 and OH. Their potential for impacting regional air-quality is less well understood. We explore the impact of halogens on regional pollutants (focussing on O3) with the European grid of the GEOS-Chem model (0.25° × 0.3125°). It has recently been updated to include a representation of halogen chemistry. We focus on the summer of 2015 during the ICOZA campaign at the Weybourne Atmospheric Observatory on the North Sea coast of the UK. Comparisons between these observations together with those from the UK air-quality network show that the model has some skill in representing the mixing ratios/concentration of pollutants during this period. Although the model has some success in simulating the Weybourne ClNO2 observations, it significantly underestimates ClNO2 observations reported at inland locations. It also underestimates mixing ratios of IO, OIO, I2 and BrO, but this may reflect the coastal nature of these observations. Model simulations, with and without halogens, highlight the processes by which halogens can impact O3. Throughout the domain O3 mixing ratios are reduced by halogens. In northern Europe this is due to a change in the background O3 advected into the region, whereas in southern Europe this is due to local chemistry driven by Mediterranean emissions. The proportion of hourly O3 above 50 nmol mol-1 in Europe is reduced from 46% to 18% by halogens. ClNO2 from N2O5 uptake onto sea-salt leads to increases in O3 mixing ratio, but these are smaller than the decreases caused by the bromine and iodine. 12% of ethane and 16% of acetone within the boundary layer is oxidised by Cl. Aerosol response to halogens is complex with small (∼10%) reductions in PM2.5 in most locations. A lack of observational constraints coupled to large uncertainties in emissions and chemical processing of halogens make these conclusions tentative at best. However, the results here point to the potential for halogen chemistry to influence air quality policy in Europe and other parts of the world. © The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028348721

Transitioning the hen housing type from traditional high-rise (where manure is stored within the house for about one year) to modern manure-belt style (where manure is removed every 1 to 4 d and placed into long-term storage) has significantly improved in-barn air quality and reduced farm-level ammonia emissions. As a direct result of the advantages, 100% of new construction for U.S. egg production incorporates manure-belt systems that regularly remove manure from the houses. However, manure-belt system designs (e.g., active vs. passive drying of manure on the belt) and management practices (e.g., frequency of manure removal) vary considerably across the industry, leading to large variations in system performance and efficiency. Thus, questions remain about the optimal design and management of manure-belt facilities to achieve the desired reductions in ammonia emissions. As part of the Coalition for a Sustainable Egg Supply (CSES) project, 27 months of continually monitored environmental data (including ammonia and greenhouse gas emissions) were collected from three hen-housing systems: a conventional cage house (CC) with a 200,000- hen capacity, an enriched colony house (EC) with a 50,000-hen capacity, and an aviary house (AV) with a 50,000-hen capacity. All three hen houses were located on the same farm and were populated with Lohmann white hens of the same age. All houses were equipped with manure-drying air ducts above the manure belts using recirculated indoor air (flow rate ranging from 0.46 to 1.49 m3 h-1 hen-1). Manure on the belts was completely removed every 3 to 4 d. Average daily houselevel ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions as affected by manure accumulation time (MAT, from 1 to 4 d) on the manure belts were analyzed. Results indicate that for all three types of houses, NH3 emission rates (g hen-1 d-1) were significantly lower for MAT of 1 and 2 d (mean ±SE of 0.061 ±0.005 and 0.064 ±0.004, respectively) than for MAT of 3 and 4 d (0.085 ±0.005 and 0.115 ±0.007, respectively) (p &lt; 0.001). Emissions of CO2 (g hen-1 d-1) were not significantly affected by MAT, averaging 67.8 ±5.7 for CC, 74.7 ±10.2 for EC, and 75.9 ±10.5 for AV.

Quantifying the detrimental effects on health and their costs derived from high PM2.5 levels is crucial because of the unsolved challenges to mitigate air pollution in the following decades. Using the daily monitoring data on PM2.5 concentrations and clinic visits, we found a non-linear increase of respiratory diseases, but not for other diseases (e.g., digestive diseases) under severe air pollution. We found an increase of respiratory diseases by 1% for each 10 μg m−3 increase in PM2.5 when the annual average daily PM2.5 concentration was less than 50 μg m−3; while this ratio was doubled (around 2%) with the daily PM2.5 concentration larger than 50 μg m−3. Under severe air pollution (PM2.5 concentration &gt;150 μg m−3), the respiratory diseases increased by over 50% compared to that in clean days. Children are more sensitive to the severe air pollution. The increase of clinic visits, especially for adults, was observed mainly in bigger (&gt;500 beds) hospitals. Re-allocating medical resources (e.g., doctors) from big hospitals to community hospitals can benefit the respiratory patients due to air pollution. The total medical cost of clinic visits of respiratory diseases derived from PM2.5 pollution was estimated at 17.2–57.0 billion Yuan in 2014 in China, accounting for 0.5–1.6% of national total health expenditure. Because these medical costs only represent a small part of total health cost derived from air pollution, the reduction of associated health costs would be an important co-benefit of implementation of air pollution preventive strategies. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Age structure; China; Clinic visit; Health cost; Medical resource; PM2.5","Hospitals; Pulmonary diseases; Age structures; China; Clinic visit; Health costs; Medical resource; PM2.5; Air pollution; age structure; air quality; atmospheric pollution; environmental factor; health expenditure; medical geography; nonlinearity; pollution control; respiratory disease; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollution; air pollution control; air temperature; Article; child; China; community hospital; controlled study; cost of illness; health care access; health hazard; human; ICD-10-CM; infant; medical record; newborn; nonlinear regression analysis; particulate matter; respiratory tract disease; smog; wind; adverse effects; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; city; economics; female; incidence; Lung Diseases; male; middle aged; pollution; preschool child; theoretical model; very elderly; young adult; China; air pollutant; particulate matter; Adolescent; Adult; Aged, 80 and over; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Child; Child, Preschool; China; Cities; Environmental Pollution; Female; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Lung Diseases; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Theoretical; Particulate Matter; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013997595

This paper calculates the baseline emission factor in the power sector and uses the index decomposition method to analyze the variation trend of the emission factor. For the SO2, the simple average baseline emission factor is 1.15 kg/MWh. The east China has the highest emission factor and the central has the lowest number. As for the NOx, the simple average is 1.76 kg/MWh, the northeast China has the highest emission factor, and the South China has the lowest emission factor. And the decomposition analysis takes into account three driving factors: pollution control technology level, fuel mix and power structure. The variation from 2005 to 2013 of the SO2 baseline emission factor is mostly influenced by the pollutant control technology improvement, and fuel mix in thermal power industry makes small contribution on the emission reduction and the influence brought by fuel mix varies a lot among different regions. As for the variation of NOx emission factor from 2007 to 2013, the technology level causes biggest variation too. The fuel mix also makes some positive contribution on east and central China. And the power structure don't have significant influence on the variation of both SO2 and NOx baseline emission factor. © 2017 The Authors.","Air pollution; Baseline; Decompositon Analysis; Power sector","Air pollution; Emission control; Fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution; Pollution control; Sulfur dioxide; Baseline; Decomposition analysis; Decomposition methods; Decompositon Analysis; Emission reduction; Pollutant control; Pollution control technology; Power sector; Factor analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020701429

Herein, a multi-functional synergistic photoelectrocatalytic (PEC) interface is employed to realize enhanced PEC CO2 reduction by using intrinsic Au doped TiO2 as the light harvester, nanotube photonic crystal (NTPC) as optical channels and Cu nanoparticles (NPs) as CO2 electrocatalyst. Formic acid is produced as the main product with a selectivity of 98% and a Faraday efficiency of 82.6% under simulated sunlight illumination and an applied potential of −1.0 V vs. Ag/AgCl. Its yield ratio is up to 1019.3 μmol L−1 cm−2 after an 8 h reduction, nearly 6.3 times higher than that on the traditional TiO2 NTs. Such enhanced PEC CO2 conversion performance is due to a synergistic catalytic effect on this multi-functional interface. The extraordinary localized surface plasmon resonance sensitized by the intrinsic Au NPs expands the light absorption region to the visible region. The photonic crystal layer structure raises the multi-reflection of incident light. The electrocatalyst of Cu NPs synergistically promotes PEC activity toward CO2 reduction. The calculated enhancement factors of photonic crystal layer, intrinsic Au NPs, and Cu NPs are 813%, 91%, and 2028%, respectively.

However, a few successful EBPR processes operated at high temperature have been reported recently. This study aimed to have an in-depth understanding on the impact of feeding strategy and carbon source types on EBPR performance in tropical climate. P-removal performance of two EBPR systems was monitored through tracking effluent quality and cyclic studies. The results confirmed that EBPR was successfully obtained and maintained at high temperature with a multi-cycle strategy. More stable performance was observed with acetate as the sole carbon source compared to propionate. Stoichiometric ratios of phosphorus and carbon transformation during both anaerobic and aerobic phases were higher at high temperature than low temperature (20±1 °C) except anaerobic PHA/C ratios within most of the sub-cycles. Furthermore, the fractions of PHA and glycogen in biomass were lower compared with one-cycle pulse feed operation.

To curb greenhouse gas emissions, the Chinese government has launched restrict regulatory system and imposed the energy consumption constraint in the textile industry to guarantee the achievability of low carbon economy. The authors aim to examine how the energy consumption constraint affects the optimal decisions of the supply chain members and address the supply chain coordination issue. Design/methodology/approach: The authors conduct two case studies from Chinese textile companies and examine the impact of energy consumption constraints on their production and operations management. Based on the real industrial practices, the authors then develop a simple analytical model for a low carbon supply chain in which it consists of one single retailer and one single manufacturer, and the manufacturer determines the choice of clean technology for energy efficiency improvement and emission reduction. Findings: From the case studies, the authors find that the textile companies develop clean technologies to reduce carbon emission in production process under the energy consumption enforcement. In this analytical model, the authors derive the optimal decisions of the supply chain members and reveal that supply chain coordination can be achieved if the manufacturer properly sets the reservation wholesale price (WS) despite the production capacity can fulfill partial market demand under a WS (or cost sharing) contract. The authors also find that the cost-sharing contract may induce the manufacturer to increase the investment of clean technology and reduce the optimal WS. Originality/value: This paper discusses low carbon supply chain practices in China’s textile industry and contributes toward green supply chain development. Managerial implications are identified, which are beneficial to the entire textile industry in the developing countries. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","China; Energy consumption; Low carbon; Textile supply chain",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026917267

This paper describes the design of an integrated transportation and air quality modelling framework capable of simulating traffic emissions and air pollution at a refined spatio-temporal scale. For this purpose, emissions of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) were estimated in the Greater Montreal Region at the level of individual trips and vehicles. In turn, hourly Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) concentrations were simulated across different seasons and validated against observations. Our validation results reveal a reasonable performance of the modelling chain. The modelling system was used to evaluate the impact of an extensive regional transit improvement strategy revealing reductions in NO2concentrations across the territory by about 3.6% compared to the base case in addition to a decrease in the frequency and severity of NO2hot spots. This is associated with a reduction in total NOxemissions of 1.9% compared to the base case; some roads experienced reductions by more than half. Finally, a methodology for assessing individuals’ daily exposure is developed (by tracking activity locations and trajectories) and we observed a reduction of 20.8% in daily exposures compared to the base case. The large difference between reductions in the mean NO2concentration across the study domain and the mean NO2exposure across the sample population results from the fact that NO2concentrations dropped largely in the areas which attract the most individuals. This exercise illustrates that evaluating the air quality impacts of transportation scenarios by solely quantifying reductions in air pollution concentrations across the study domain would lead to an underestimation of the potential health gains. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; CALMET; CALPUFF; Dispersion modelling; Nitrogen dioxide (NO2); Policy scenario; Public transit; Traffic emissions","Air quality; Investments; Urban transportation; CALMET; Calpuff; Dispersion Modelling; Nitrogen dioxides; Policy scenario; Public transit; Traffic emissions; Nitrogen oxides; air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); dispersion; environmental modeling; nitrogen dioxide; policy approach; pollution exposure; public transport; software; spatial distribution; temporal distribution; traffic emission; transportation policy; Canada; Montreal; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012983015

One of possible solutions is an extension of the lean ignition limit of stable combustion. With the decrease of the stoichiometry of combustible mixture the minimal size of the ignition kernel (necessary for development of combustion) increases. Therefore, it is necessary to use some special techniques to extend the ignition kernel region. Pulsed microwave discharge allows the formation of the ignition kernels of larger diameters. Although the microwave discharge igniter (MDI) was already tested for initiation of combustion and demonstrated quite promising results, the parameters of plasma was not yet studied before. Present work demonstrates the results of the dynamics of spatial structure of the MDI plasma with nanosecond time resolution. It was shown that the size of the plasma region increases from 2-4 to 10-15 mm3 during the discharge development. Gas temperature and vibrational temperature were measured with optical emission spectroscopy. The electric field in the discharge was measured from the analysis of emission intensities of the first negative (N+2(B2?+u) → N+2(X2 Σ +u)) and the second positive (N2(C3πu) → N2(B3πg)) systems of molecular nitrogen.

The story of the modern total hip arthroplasty, one of the most successful surgical interventions of the century, is an example of how technology can evolve and provide significant benefits. There is a need for innovation and surgeons willing to challenge the status quo in order for the field of orthopedic surgery to continue to improve patient care. Thus, it is important for providers to understand the process of introducing new technology, ethical concerns with new technology, and the cost of developing and implementing new technology. In this article, we review current literature and highlight contemporary concerns with the introduction of new technologies in orthopedic care. Examples of successes and failures are abundant. The foot and ankle subspecialty in particular has a multitude of innovation and new technology that offer potential improvements to prior standards of care. New findings suggesting total ankle replacements as an alternative to ankle arthrodesis are an example of this progress. Continued research and innovation is crucial for improving orthopedic care, and the orthopedic community must learn from these experiences and remain vigilant of potential pitfalls by maintaining a balance between regulatory oversight with a climate suitable for ongoing medical exploration and innovation. Device companies, regulators, and health care systems and providers need to work synergistically with the common goal of improving patient care. Copyright © 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

There is a potential to reduce the risk of wind erosion using no-tillage or chemical fallow cropping systems, but wind erosion observations are lacking from these systems. We measured sediment and PM10 flux from reduced-tillage WW/SF, no-tillage wheat/ chemical fallow (NTW/CF), and no-tillage spring barley (Hor-deum vulgare L.)/spring wheat (NTSB/SW) using a portable wind tunnel near Ralston, WA. Horizontal sediment flux, wind speed, and PM10 concentration were measured over two consecutive 10 min sampling periods inside the tunnel after sowing wheat in spring or late summer on four replications of the rotations. Sediment flux was measured with a modified Bagnold type sampler while wind speed and PM10 concentration were respectively measured with pitot tubes and aerosol monitors positioned at six heights above the soil surface inside the tunnel. Sediment and PM10 fluxes were an order of magnitude greater in late summer than spring. After sowing wheat in spring, sediment and PM10 fluxes were greater for the NTSB/SW than NTW/CF rotation while, after sowing winter wheat in late summer, sediment and PM10 fluxes were greater for the WW/ SF than the NTSB/SW rotation.

Given Russia is a key supplier of fossil fuels, a major greenhouse gas emitter, and climate impacts on its vast territory likely to have far-reaching consequences, this contextual research shows that the country's current policies fall woefully short of what is required to implement the Paris Agreement. To support Russia in developing informed, internally consistent and scientifically literate energy policies, this paper presents low-carbon emission trajectories commensurate with the 2 °C goal, using stakeholder-informed backcasting. The results illustrate that even if Russia's CO2emissions peak in 2017, a reduction rate of at least 9% per year between 2020 and 2030 is required to meet a 2 °C budget constraint. These sustained rates are in excess of anything achieved globally or, indeed, deemed possible within most studies. Such emission reductions would involve unprecedented material changes to Russia's energy system, including both rapidly cutting energy demand and building extensive low-carbon infrastructures. Nevertheless, failure to transform Russia's existing policies will likely have global repercussions for achieving the Paris Agreement's goals. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Backcasting; Climate change targets; Cumulative emissions; Emission scenarios; Russia","Budget control; Carbon; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Backcasting; Contextual research; Cumulative emissions; Emission reduction targets; Emission scenario; Low-carbon emissions; Russia; Russian Government; Climate change; emission control; energy policy; energy use; environmental policy; participatory approach; policy implementation; stakeholder; state role; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012068021

This paper summarises the work that has been undertaken in a collaborative manner into ""unconventional geology"" exploring migration assisted trapping in an on-shore saline aquifer by Government, private sector contractors and researchers in the south west of Western Australia. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS), which involves capturing carbon dioxide that would otherwise be emitted to the atmosphere and injecting it to be stored in deep geological formations, is a potential stepping stone to maintaining energy security while reducing the carbon footprint of Australia's energy sources. CCS is the only technology available to make deep cuts in greenhouse gas emissions while still using the fossil fuels that power much of today's energy infrastructure. At a State level, the Western Australian Greenhouse Strategy incorporates CCS and is helping to address the need for a long-term commitment to climate change and cleaner energy. The Western Australia Department of Mines and Petroleum (DMP) started investigating the Lesueur site, near large CO2 emission sources (the industrial centres of Kwinana and Collie in the South West of Western Australia) in 2007 and developed the South West Hub (SW Hub) project concept in 2010 with the support of local industrial partners. The project was designated an ""Australian Flagship"" project in 2011 and has received substantial funding and support from the Federal Government, through the Department of Industry Innovation and Science) the Western Australia State Government and industry. The SW Hub Project is progressing data acquisition and analysis aimed at establishing confidence in storage associated with migration assisted trapping (MAT) in unconfined saline aquifers. The storage complex has no regional shale layer and consists of the Lower Lesueur (Wonnerup Member) as the injection reservoir, the Upper Lesueur (Yalgorup Member) with its numerous paleosol baffles as the lower confining layer and the basal shale part of the Eneabba Formation as the upper confining layer. The injection reservoir is a heterogeneous sandstone that is over 1500 m thick with varying permeability layers that should support residual and solubility trapping. From the very onset, the SW Hub Project has followed a rigorous stage gated decision making program. The project has been divided into phases and each phase involves targeted data acquisition plans to address technical gaps or uncertainties. These uncertainties have been documented in an Uncertainty Management Plan (UMP) and drive all technical work. ""Decision Gates"" ensure that, only on increased confidence of success would the project move to the next phase. The project processes are consistent with the DNV CO2QUALSTORE steps and the workflows defined in the EU Directive 2009/31/EC guidance document. Under the first phase of the new data acquisition program (2011-12), new geological data was gathered through 100 km of targeted 2D seismic lines and one deep exploration well drilled to 2,945 metres. Multiple modelling scenarios with differing assumptions on the geological properties supported the storage concept and identified no ""show stoppers"". Notwithstanding, uncertainty planning required additional data to address the gaps identified. Under the next phase of the development program (2013-15), 3D seismic was acquired over 115 km2 and additional wells planned. The area of interest is dominated by farming activity and not all landowners provided consent to acquire the seismic data. As such, while high fold data has been acquired over the deeper Wonnerup Member reservoir sections, the shallower Yalgorup Member was not as well illuminated. The drilling strategy was adapted to maximise geological coverage particularly across the shallower reservoirs. Three wells were drilled using a combination of mineral and water well drilling rigs with a deeper well to be considered following model updates. Significant technical work has also been done to support this development through a range of research projects launched under the auspices of the Australian National Low Emissions Coal research and development program (ANLEC R&amp;D). These projects are focused on reservoir characterisation and either consider more fundamental physics based questions or delve significantly deeper into specific geology and geophysics domains using laboratory and modelling efforts. Clear decision criteria to support additional investment in a drilling and testing program have been defined and will be addressed by modelling. The paper will explain the project challenges and the decision making rationale, highlighting the importance of good processes, long term planning, and extensive stakeholder management supported by a robust technical program. Results to date support MAT and validation of the SW Hub storage concept will substantially increase the number of geologic sites that can be considered for safe storage around the world. There is significant international interest in the project field and research activities. © 2017 The Authors.","CCS; CO2; Community; Geosequestration; Legislation; Lesueur; Policy; Regulation; South West Hub; SWH; Wonnerup; Yalgorup","Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Data acquisition; Decision making; Digital storage; Energy security; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Industrial emissions; Investments; Laws and legislation; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Public policy; Seismic response; Seismic waves; Seismology; Shale; Software testing; Testing; Water wells; Well drilling; Community; Geo sequestrations; Lesueur; Regulation; South West Hub; Wonnerup; Yalgorup; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029660597

In order to identify appropriate strategies to control GLO levels, accurate assessment and prediction is essential, for which elaborate simulation and modelling is required. Several studies have been undertaken in the past to simulate GLO levels at different scales and for various applications. It is important to evaluate these studies, widely spread over in literature. This paper aims to critically review various studies that have been undertaken, especially in the past 15 years (2000–15) to model GLO. The review has been done of the studies that range over different spatial scales – urban to regional and continental to global. It also includes a review of performance evaluation and sensitivity analysis of photo-chemical transport models in order to assess the extent of application of these models and their predictive capability. The review indicates following major findings: (a) models tend to over-estimate the night-time GLO concentrations due to limited titration of GLO with NO within the model; (b) dominance of contribution from far-off regional sources to average ozone concentration in the urban region and higher contribution of local sources during days of high ozone episodes; requiring strategies for controlling precursor emissions at both regional and local scales; (c) greater influence of NOx over VOC in export of ozone from urban regions due to shifting of urban plumes from VOC-sensitive regime to NOx-sensitive as they move out from city centres to neighbouring rural regions; (d) models with finer resolution inputs perform better to a certain extent, however, further improvement in resolutions (beyond 10 km) did not show improvement always; (e) future projections show an increase in GLO concentrations mainly due to rise in temperatures and biogenic VOC emissions. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Ozone; Performance; Photo-chemical transport modelling; Resolution","Chemical analysis; Global warming; Modal analysis; Nitrogen oxides; Optical resolving power; Productivity; Sensitivity analysis; Agricultural productivity; Chemical transport; Chemical transport models; Ozone concentration; Performance; Performance evaluations; Predictive capabilities; Simulation and modelling; Ozone; nitrogen oxide; ozone; accuracy assessment; concentration (composition); global warming; literature review; ozone; performance assessment; photochemistry; pollutant transport; pollution monitoring; resolution; sensitivity analysis; troposphere; urban region; volatile organic compound; advection; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; ambient air; Asia; climate change; dry deposition; Europe; global change; meteorology; North America; photochemistry; physical chemistry; plume; pollutant; priority journal; radiative forcing; Review; sensitivity analysis; simulation; solar radiation; summer; thermodynamics; titrimetry; troposphere; urban area; winter",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016604380

This investigation is carried out to cater to the need of burning liquid fuels (including alternative fuels) with minimum emissions in gas turbine engines used for both aircraft and land based power generation applications using modern combustion technologies. In the present combustor design, the air inlet and the exhaust ports are located on the same side (and hence the name reverse-flow) whereas the liquid fuel is injected directly into the strong cross-flow of the air using a small diameter round tube to aid fuel atomization. Hence, a conventional atomization system is absent in the investigated combustor. The reverse-flow configuration allows effective internal product gas recirculation to facilitate the preheating and dilution of the oxidizer stream and stabilization of a distributed reaction zone. This apparently suppresses near stoichiometric reactions and hot spot regions resulting in low pollutant (NOx and CO) emissions. In the present case, the heat load is varied (keeping a constant air flow rate) from 3.125 kW to 6.25 kW which results in the thermal intensity variation from 19 MW/m3-atm to 39 MW/m3-atm. Two different tubes with internal diameters (dfuel) of 0.5 mm and 0.8 mm are used for injection of liquid fuel into the cross flow of air. The combustor was also tested in premixed-prevaporized (PP) mode with ethanol for benchmarking.

It has also brought in its wake up many unwanted substances and social problems. One of these problems is the degradation of the environment. The environment, upon which our life is most dependent, has fallen victim of pollution brought by the man himself through unplanned and unscientific development and mineral exploitation. Air pollution is an inevitable harmful by-product of rapid industrialization and urbanization that is responsible for a variety of deleterious effects on both human and plant communities. It has been a major environmental concern since the beginning of industrialization, resulting in a release of gaseous and particulate pollutants into the atmosphere. A relationship between traffic density and photosynthetic activity, stomatal conductance, total chlorophyll content and leaf senescence has been reported. Exposure of evergreen plants to air pollutants create many changes in physiological and biochemical parameters. Each plant species has a different ability to absorb and adsorb pollutants by their foliar surfaces, which is influenced by several biochemical, physiological and morphological characteristics. Rampant and uncontrolled use of fossil fuels in industries and transport sector has led to an increase in concentrations of the gaseous pollutants. Indian cities are facing serious problems of airborne particulate matter. Atmospheric particulate matter, which is a mixture of diverse elements, is of most concern in context of public health. Particulates may also cause a reduction in yield, change in photosynthesis and transpiration along with foliar injuries. The plant species which accumulate more dust onto their surfaces can act as buffer around industries and along roadsides. The present study deals with the plant-pollutant interactions and how the physical and chemical characteristics of plants vary with air pollution. It also throws light on how dust affects various plant species and what is the role of plants in dust accumulation. © 2017, Technoscience Publications.

Low threshold and variable emission wavelength of the random lasers are realized by adjusting the concentration of CuSO4 in the mixtures. With the exception of the multiple scattering of light caused by micro-crystals dispersed in the mixtures, another underlying physical mechanism for tuning random laser is closely related to energy transfer between the molecules of PM597 and CuSO4. Meanwhile, we also demonstrate the realization of a plasmonic random laser by doping Au nanoparticles (NPS) in the PM597-doped CuSO4 mixture. We find that the localized surface plasmon resonance of Au NPS lowers the threshold, increases the emission intensity and reduces the number of the lasing modes of the random lasers.

With the urgent demand of clean energy for economy growth and reduction of air pollution, more and more pipeline projects had been completed and have been launching in the past decade. Aiming at greatly increasing efficiency and saving budget, higher strength and larger-diameter pipes have been developed and applied for constructing long distance pipeline projects in China. For example, X80 grade pipeline has been applied to the 2nd west to east gas pipeline (2nd WEGP) with a distance of 7000 km. This is the longest pipeline built by X80 pipeline steel in the world. Comparing with the first west to east gas pipeline(lst WEGP) built by X70, the diameter increased from 1016 mm to 1219 mm, wall thickness from 14.6 mm to 18.4 mm, gas pressure from 10 MPa to 12 MPa, the transmission capacity increased from 17 bmVa to 30 bm3/a. Taking account of the steel amount, construction cost and other market reason (almost 95% was supplied by domestic steel companies), the investment of the 2nd WEGP is almost as same as the lst WEGP.

Simultaneously, human exposure to particulate matter from urban transportation is of major concern worldwide due to the proximity of pedestrians, drivers, and cyclists to the emission sources. Vegetation used for stormwater treatment can help designers limit the exposure of people to air pollutants. This goal can be achieved through the deliberate placement of green streets, along with strategic planting schemes that maximize pollutant dispersion. This communication presents general design considerations for green streets that combine stormwater management and air quality goals. There is currently limited guidance on designing green streets for air quality considerations; this is the first communication to offer suggestions and advice for the design of green stormwater streets in regards to their effects on air quality. Street characteristics including (1) the width to height ratio of the street to the buildings, (2) the type of trees and their location, and (3) any prevailing winds can have an impact on pollutant concentrations within the street and along sidewalks.

The algorithm for obtaining anode mass according to the proposed technological scheme is the following. The components of coke batch-bunches of different fractional composition from bunkers 2 by metering devices 3 and transport screws 5 are fed to preheater 6 where they are heated to a temperature of 200-220 ° C. Further, the heated components of the coke batch are fed into the mixer 11. Coke dust before entering the mixer 11 by the dispenser 4 from the bunker 1 is fed into the dust preheater 9 where it is also heated to a temperature of 200-220 ° C. Pitch, preheated to a temperature of 200-2400C, is fed into the dispenser 8. Further heated coke dust and pitch enter high-voltage charging units 7, where they acquire electrical charges for 1-3 seconds, pitch-negative, and coke dust-positive. At the same time, the voltage at the electrodes of high-voltage charging stations is in the range of 24000-50000 V DC. Charged in this way, pitch and coke dust also enter mixer 11, where they are mixed for 3-4 minutes with each other and with coke batch. From the mixer 11, the finished anode mass is fed into the extruder 10 to form briquettes. In general, the process of anode preparation takes 4-5 minutes, which is 2 times lower than with “traditional” technology. The presented technology allows essentially to raise productivity of the manufacture equipment of an anode mass at the expense of time reduction of mixing more than in 2 times. Reducing the mixing time of components reduces the specific electricity consumption for anode production by 20-25 kW/t, taking into account the energy consumption of the high-voltage charging unit. An increase in the degree of impregnation of coke dust with pitch reduces the anode fall-off under the conditions of the active electrolyzer and reduces the yield of coal foam by 5-7 kg/ton of Al. Reducing the yield of coal foam reduces the time of the electrolyzer in the depressurized state by an average of 0.2-0.25 hours during the day, which reduces the specific fluoride emissions by 0.1-0.2 kg/ton Al. © Research India Publications.","Aluminum electrolyzer; Anode; Carbon; Coal foam; Consumption; Method; Oxidation; Protection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039967460

As a result, decreases in CO2 were at the highest level in Ficus, and Dieffenbachia at 25°C, followed by Spathiphyllum at 25°C and Yucca at 20°C. The amount of photosynthesis increased the leaf surface. For this reason, they reduced the amount of CO2 by increasing the amount of photosynthesis.

Specifically, initial linear optimal perturbations (LOPs) in temperature and salinity that vary with depth, longitude, and latitude are computed, and the maximum impact on the ocean of these perturbations is evaluated in a realistic ocean general circulation model. The computations of the LOPs involve a maximization procedure based on Lagrange multipliers in a nonautonomous context. To assess the impact of these perturbations four different measures of the North Atlantic Ocean state are used: meridional volume and heat transports (MVT and MHT) and spatially averaged sea surface temperature (SST) and ocean heat content (OHC). It is shown that these metrics are dramatically different with regard to predictability. Whereas OHC and SST can be efficiently modified only by basin-scale anomalies, MVT and MHT are also strongly affected by smaller-scale perturbations. This suggests that instantaneous or even annual-mean values of MVT and MHT are less predictable than SST and OHC. Only when averaged over several decades do the former two metrics have predictability comparable to the latter two, which highlights the need for long-term observations of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation in order to accumulate climatically relevant data. This study also suggests that initial errors in ocean temperature of a few millikelvins, encompassing both the upper and deep ocean, can lead to ~0.1-K errors in the predictions of North Atlantic sea surface temperature on interannual time scales. This transient error growth peaks for SST and OHC after about 6 and 10 years, respectively, implying a potential predictability barrier. © 2017 American Meteorological Society.","Climate prediction; Climate variability; General circulation models; Meridional overturning circulation; Ocean circulation; Ocean dynamics","Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Climatology; Errors; Excited states; Lagrange multipliers; Submarine geophysics; Surface properties; Surface waters; Climate prediction; Climate variability; General circulation model; Meridional overturning circulations; Ocean circulation; Ocean dynamics; Oceanography; air-sea interaction; climate prediction; climate variation; decadal variation; general circulation model; meridional circulation; modeling; overturn; salinity; sea surface temperature; water temperature; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85008692946

Steady, axisymmetric, laminar flow of two counterflowing streams toward a stagnation plane is considered. One stream, called the fuel-stream is made up of a mixture of methane (CH4) and nitrogen (N2). The other stream, called the oxidizer-stream, is a mixture of oxygen (O2), carbon monoxide (CO) and N2. Chemical reactions, represented by four global steps, are presumed to take place in a thin reaction zone. To the leading order the reactants, CH4, O2, are completely consumed in the reaction zone, while there is leakage of CO from the reaction zone to the leading order. On either side of this thin reaction zone, the flow field is inert. These inert regions represent the outer structure of the flame. The outer structures provide matching conditions required for predicting the structure of the reaction zone. In the reaction zone, chemical reactions are presumed to take place in two layers-the inner layer and the oxidation layer. The oxidation layer is presumed to be made of two sub-layers. In one sub-layer consumption of O2 takes place, while in the other layer H2 is presumed to maintain steady-state. The scalar-dissipation rate at extinction is predicted from results of the asymptotic analysis and are found to qualitatively agree well with measurements. A key finding is that with increasing amounts of CO added to the oxidizer-stream the scalar-dissipation rate at extinction first increases and then decreases. It is attributed to changes in location of the reaction zone within the reaction zone. © 2017 Eastern States Section of the Combustion Institute.

The aim of this paper is, therefore, providing a methodology that could be useful for the decision makers by giving them not only an optimal point but also a whole region where they can focus on their attention. Knowing that biofuels are settling as a new alternative energy source which has been spreading around the world to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and oil dependence, this methodology is tested in the real case of locating a biorefinery in Navarre, Spain. Moreover, A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model has been developed to generate optimal region vertices as well as some other supply chain characteristics, including, among others, which crops are going to be harvested, when they are going to be collected, and their storage levels. Additionally, two criteria were implemented in MILP model to create two optimal regions: one considering an economic criterion and other one minimizing environmental impact. As a result, two regions were drawn in the Navarrese territory that point out where a biorefinery should be located and how the supply chain should be designed. © 2017 The Authors.

The draft tube is an important component of a Francis turbine which is one of the small hydropower systems, influences the hydraulic performance. Moreover, as the swirl flow in the draft tube of the Francis turbine decreases pressure at the inlet region, the suppression of swirl flow can be a useful method of minimizing the occurrence of cavitation. In this study, the flow characteristics in a Francis turbine on the 15 MW hydropower generations have been investigated numerically with various shapes of draft tube. Numerical analysis was conducted by using the commercial code, ANSYS CFX. Results showed that the grooved model has relatively uniform distribution of pressure field compared with basic model.

However, it is not clearly understood how these diverse legumes contribute to the resilience of such systems in semi-arid environments. We describe the growth, development and resource-use efficiency (focusing on radiation, RUE) of three promising short-season grain legumes: common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L.), cowpea (Vigna unguiculata (L.) Walp.) and lablab (Lablab purpureus (L.) Sweet). Two field experiments were conducted during the short rains of 2012-13 and 2013-14 in Eastern Kenya. In the first experiment, the legumes were grown at three plant densities (low, medium, high); in the second experiment, they were subjected to three water regimes (rainfed, partly irrigated, fully irrigated). Phenological development was monitored and biomass accumulation, leaf area index and fractional radiation interception were measured repeatedly during growth; grain yield was measured at maturity. Harvest index and RUE were calculated from these data. Common bean had the shortest growing period (70 days), the most compact growth habit and relatively high RUE but limited grain yield (1000-1900kgha-1), thereby proving more suitable for cultivation in areas with restricted cropping windows or in intercropping systems. Cowpea had a longer growing period (90 days) and a spreading growth habit leading to high light interception and outstanding grain yields under optimal conditions (1400-3050kgha-1). Lablab showed stable RUE values (0.76-0.92gMJ-1), was relatively unaffected by limited water availability and had a comparatively long growing period (100 days). Lablab grain yields of ∼1200-2350kgha-1 were obtained across all water regimes, indicating a high potential to cushion climatic variability. Planting density strongly influenced the production success of cowpea and lablab, with high plant densities leading to vigorous growth habit with low podset establishment. Such information on temporal and spatial differences in growth, development and resource-use efficiency is highly valuable for crop-modelling applications and for designing more resilient farming systems with short-season grain legumes. © CSIRO 2017.","climate-smart agriculture; phenology; plant physiology; resource-use efficiency","adaptation; adaptive management; biomass allocation; cereal; crop yield; cultivation; experimental study; growth response; hydrological regime; intercropping; leaf area index; legume; phenology; resource use; semiarid region; smallholder; Kenya; Lablab; Lablab purpureus; Phaseolus vulgaris; Vigna unguiculata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021330842

The large variety of carbonaceous solid materials corresponds also to a large variety of applications. Beyond the numerous and strategic industrial applications, from the field of energy production to that of innovative materials, we can recall also the role played in natural and biological processes: atmospheric dust, for example, is responsible of several meteorological phenomena, carbonaceous nanoparticles are related to lung deseases, solid active carbon is employed in drug delivery etc. We can probably say that oxidation of solid carbon is the reaction that mankind exploited earliest, since men learned to light up a fire. Over the ages combustion of wood first and of fossil fuels later, has continued to sustain the energy demand and the progress of human society and, despite the efforts of the scientific community to find alternative routes for energy production, a significant fraction of the global energy demand is likely to remain dependent on combustion of solid carbon also in the near future. In the second half of the last century the need to reduce pollution from coal fired power plants, in particular soot, NOx and SOx emissions, motivated significant research on the chemistry as well as on the physical phenomena involved in coal combustion. The basis of our current knowledge in carbon oxidation was formed at that time, allowing some important scientific and technological advances in the field of coal to energy. Over the last decade the environmental challenge and the rising concerns about climate change have become prime drivers of scientific and technological development in the field of solid fuel combustion and gasification. Studies in this field are targeted to the development of novel combustion concepts that make CO2 capture and sequestration inherently more economical and feasible. This goal is pursued by re-thinking combustion technologies in such a way that carbon dioxide is highly concentrated at the exhaust, possibly free of any contaminants, so that it can be more easily compressed and disposed of through the sequestration path. Chemical looping combustion and Oxy-combustion are two examples of these new generation ""capture ready"" combustion technologies. In such innovative technologies carbon oxidation is carried out under more severe conditions than ever, for instance at very high temperature and pressure, in CO2 rich environments, or experiencing continuous temperature and oxygen swings. The knowledge so far available on coal combustion has proved unable to explain the behavior of coal oxidation under such conditions. On a different, but parallel route, the current rush towards the development of innovative carbon based materials, for a multitude of industrial applications, has also entailed investigations on the affinity of solid carbons towards oxygen. The attention has been put, in this case, on ordered carbon materials such as graphene and graphite, carbon composites, carbon nanotubes etc. and on how their properties are altered by oxidation under mild oxidizing or even ambient conditions. It is astonishing that despite the very long time research on coal, on the one side, and the more recent but massive research carried out on graphene on the other, there are still many unresolved (or poorly understood) aspects in the heterogeneous oxidation of carbons:: what are the bonding modes of oxygen on different solid carbons? What is the range of atomic equilibrium distance? What are the spin state of the absorbing site and of the absorption complexes? What is the energetic range of C-O bond? Is it a strong physisorption or a weak chemisorption? What are the kinetics of the absorption and desorption on the molecular scale?. © 2017 The Authors.

However, its non miscibility with diesel, especially at high alcohol ratios, low cetane number and poor lubricating characteristics have restricted its utilization in diesel engines. Usually, when ethanol contents in the blends reach 20-40%, high concentration of additives are needed to ensure the mixture homogeneity in the presence of high water contents, and to attain the required cetane number for suitable ignition. Therefore, selection of suitable additives plays a vital role for increasing the solubility of ethanol to a larger extent. Similarly, selection of a suitable surfactant is very important for obtaining long lasting emulsions. The surfactant span 20 and tween 20 have been selected here on account of their favourable properties and been focused in this study, as they have been used to stabilize the ethanol diesel and water emulsions and as an alternate fuel. A single-cylinder, air-cooled, direct injection diesel engine that could develop a power output of 5.2 kW at 1500 rev/min was used.

The aim is to control both the physical process, that is, the fuel vapor formation rate or spatial vapor distribution, and chemical processes, which are the mixture ignition, emission reduction of NOx and particulate matter, and HC burnout.","Combustion control; Evaporation process; Flash boiling; Fuel design; Mixed multicomponent fuel; Spray atomization; Spray dispersion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027711271

This increased grape and wine production coupled with the current severe drought in the Southwest United States have pushed the wine and agricultural industries to practice efficiency, technology substitution, and water reuse. A number of water-conservation measures are now in common practice including the use of drought-tolerant grape rootstock, drip and microsprinkler irrigation, soil-moisture monitoring, and pest control (including fungicides and herbicides). Water is an essential component in wineries as well, mainly used for cleaning and purification. The effects of these measures, and prospects for future water conservation methods, are discussed.

In its fullest expression, RST could become aviation’s largest market in terms of number of flights because it could serve a large share of the billions of daily trips of less than 160 kilometers. As such, RST promises to be both economically and environmentally sustainable. That fullest expression of RST would require an extensive network of community-acceptable, high-proximity “pocket airparks” in order to minimize ground travel time (GTT). These airparks would face fundamental design constraints that would depend upon whether they were located in a downtown, high-rise urban area or a suburban residential area, and both these areas would need to be served in order to maximize market size and profitability. High proximity would require that airparks be as small as practicable while still providing the efficiency of a high duty cycle of shared use as a form of public transit. Pocket airparks would need to fulfill community noise constraints and have sufficient area to enable a high capacity of passenger throughput. Airparks would need to comply with pertinent building codes and meet the regulations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). They would need to fulfill applicable present and future FAA regulations and standards, including the integration of their traffic into the ATM system. Provisions for near-all weather operations, electrical charging stations, on-site solar panel arrays, service bays, transit connections, security, lighting, perimeter fencing, etc., would all be needed. Uniform, realistic standards for airpark size and acceptable noise limits will be fundamental to successfully implementing pocket airparks close by to where people live. From these and other requirements it is possible to distill the range of reasonable and definable design limits for both the airpark and the small Sky Taxis that will serve RST. This paper explores those requirements, compares them to what might pertain at alternative types of take off and landing sites and presents a rational plan for the implementation and operation of an RST system. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

The strong and consistent preference of individuals for distributed travel in private vehicles rather than for route-limited travel in crowded public transit also has shown no signs of diminishing. These trends have a significant adverse effect on climate change. Regional Sky Transit1,2(RST) has been proposed as a system that can drastically reduce infrastructure cost and CO2 emissions while preserving people’s preference for travel in personal vehicles by providing affordable, accessible, fast, and safe flights distributed across urban regions. RST could thus provide a substantial, new, efficient, value-added supply chain. As such, RST could become aviation’s largest market in terms of number of flights, significantly contributing to the growth of connectivity and productivity across population centers. The RST mass market could serve travelers on relatively short trip lengths of less than 160 kilometers. This civil mass market derives from the concept of high proximity aviation— extending air travel operations to numerous very small airparks that are close to where people live and work, so as to reduce ground travel time and thereby save time. This can only be achieved if the aircraft used in RST fulfill stringent limitations on allowable noise emissions that will be essential to high proximity aviation. Examination of the extensive prior research on allowable noise emissions shows that noise issues will dictate both the size of airparks and the concept of operations for RST. This paper reveals why this primacy of noise must be respected, and presents detailed examples of the profound constraints it imposes upon V/ESTOL aircraft designs intended to serve the RST mass market. The barriers to developing the ultra-quiet aircraft necessary to RST along with the most promising strategies for efficiently overcoming those barriers are presented. These strategies include models for how electric propulsion and its energy requirements can best be integrated into Sky Taxis that are suitable for the mission requirements of RST. Those integrations will examine the core science and technologies that affect propulsive noise emission and reveal opportunities for further competitive research. The value and benefits of RST will be compared with the costs of bringing about the necessary noise reduction breakthroughs. © 2017 by Brien A.Seeley M.D. Published by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85017204315

The sulfur plant enables the refinery to sell a sulfur and reduce emissions to comply with national, state and local regulations. Hydrocarbons, such as methanol, BTEX and others have different flash points and BTU values other than the normal fuel gas. The burner in the sulfur plant requires a certain BTU range in order to burn efficiently. Poor burning of the acid gas can result in the emissions going off spec. Also, the sulfur produced from the sulfur plant must meet a color spectrum specification in order to be sold at market prices. Hydrocarbon discolors that as well and will reduce the market price of the sulfur. Thus, hydrocarbon carryover into the sulfur plant becomes a serious concern. The source of the hydrocarbon carryover is almost exclusively from the amine treater. The sour water stripper mostly provides the sour gas and carries very little hydrcarbon to the sulfur plant Since amine is derived from hydrocarbon, amine also has a high affinity for absorbing hydrocarbons. The hydrocarbon that accumulates within amine treatment plants depend on the feed stock and how the amine system is configured in the flow scheme of the refinery. In our experience, there could be lubrication oils from compressors, methanol from upstream processes and also included are light hydrocarbons, BTEX, and paraffins all coming from the gas feed. The hydrocarbons that end up accumulating in the amine treater cause all sorts of interesting problems. Hydrocarbons cause foaming, burping and other upset conditions in the amine treater. The upset condition in the amine plant consequently causes amine and its absorbed hydrocarbon to be whisked away with the sour gas stream from the top of the regeneration tower in the amine system. Hydrocarbon in the amine system is bad for the sulfur plant and the amine plant. What can be done? Typical mitigation for hydrocarbon: 1)Skimming the HC from the flash drum due to different densities (this only works for some of the hydrocarbon) 2)Knockout drums installed upstream of the amine treater and upstream of the sulfur plant 3)Activated carbon 4)Use better separation techniques employed ahead of the amine plant 5)Other novel ways for removing hydrocarbon in the amine plant. © 2017 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

Here, we propose a new route to overcome intrinsic efficiency limitations in light-emitting devices by studying a CdSe nanoplatelets monolayer that exhibits strongly anisotropic, directed photoluminescence. Analysis of the two-dimensional k-space distribution reveals the underlying internal transition dipole distribution. The observed directed emission is related to the anisotropy of the electronic Bloch states governing the exciton transition dipole moment and forming a bright plane. The strongly directed emission perpendicular to the platelet is further enhanced by the optical local density of states and local fields. In contrast to the emission directionality, the off-resonant absorption into the energetically higher 2D-continuum of states is isotropic. These contrasting optical properties make the oriented CdSe nanoplatelets, or superstructures of parallel-oriented platelets, an interesting and potentially useful class of semiconductor-based emitters. © 2017 Macmillan Publishers Limited, part of Springer Nature.",,"Anisotropy; Electronic structure; II-VI semiconductors; Light emission; Optical properties; Platelets; Selenium compounds; D electronic structures; Display technologies; Emission directionality; Internal transitions; Intrinsic efficiency; K-space distribution; Light emitting devices; Local density of state; Cadmium compounds; cadmium selenide nanoplatelet; nanoparticle; quantum dot; unclassified drug; anisotropy; Article; chemical reaction kinetics; chemical structure; photoluminescence; physical chemistry; physical parameters; physical phenomena; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85031682836

While there is an increasing focus on the adaptive potential of migration, the health impacts of climate-related migration, including planned relocation and forced displacement, have not been thoroughly examined. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated that migration is currently, and will increasingly be, influenced by environmental degradation and climate change, and that it needs to be addressed in a focused and coordinated manner. Discussion: This paper examines the links between climate change, migration, and health, considering diverse migration responses, including immobility, forced displacement and planned migration, as well as the associated health risks and opportunities in different contexts. Using case studies, the paper illustrates strategies to reduce the health risks associated with climate change-related migration. Conclusion: While there is an increasing body of research examining the climate change-migration nexus, a dual approach is now required. This approach must include debate and further research regarding the health consequences and responses associated with climate migration as well as immediate strengthening of health systems to make them both climate resilient and migrant inclusive. © The Author(s). 2018.","Adaptation; Climate change; Displacement; Environmental change; Governance; Human mobility; Migration; Public health; Relocation","capacity building; climate change; Colombia; conflict; disease burden; economic recession; educational status; environmental change; food security; health hazard; health status; human; mental health; migration; morbidity; mortality; Note; Papua New Guinea; poverty; public health; refugee; risk reduction; rural area; social capital; Spain; urban area; wellbeing; environment; health impact assessment; Climate Change; Environment; Health Impact Assessment; Humans; Transients and Migrants",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042484110

Replacement of these buildings is not an option since affordable housing continues to be required in Chinese cities. Comfort requirements are currently increasing from previously undemanding behaviour to more energy-demanding comfort expectations. Retrofit of conditioning equipment in old buildings will lead to a significant increase in energy consumption, if the buildings are not upgraded (insulated, air tightened, etc.). Furthermore, although China is leading in the production of photovoltaic modules, the utilization of building integrated photovoltaic systems (BIPV) is not yet implemented at a significant scale. However, the prevailing building typology is characterized by a southerly orientation, a favourable floor-to-roof ratio, a rather simple building envelope, appropriate floor plans and not at least a roof structure able to carry PV systems. Climates in many areas in China are more favourable for solar energy generation than in other countries, such as Germany, where BIPV is already widely utilized. This paper investigates the potentials of energy upgrade of a building typology representative for a large percentage of the existing Chinese building stock for 26 climates in China. Strategies of ""efficiency"" (energy-upgrade measures), ""consistency"" (renewable energy generation and revitalisation of existing structures) as well as ""sufficiency"" (reduced comfort requirements) are discussed as the pillars of a strong concept for sustainable upgrade of China's existing building stock. © 2017 The Authors.","BIPV; carbon neutrality; China; energy upgrade; existing building stock","Carbon; Energy utilization; Floors; Housing; Photovoltaic cells; Renewable energy resources; Retrofitting; Roofs; Solar energy; BIPV; Building stocks; Carbon neutralities; China; energy upgrade; Buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029830577

The microclimate in the urban environment is effective on human well-being and on the energy demand of buildings. Especially the temperatures surrounding buildings in summer and, in case these buildings are air conditioned, the resulting energy demand for cooling are effected. However microclimatic design strategies are evaluated (if at all) qualitatively or based on short periods of 'representative conditions', while thermal building simulation studies are usually performed with climate datasets from weather stations remote from the real urban context. This paper introduces and applies an algorithm to translate available EPW climate data into annual climate datasets containing urban microclimate effects of the specific location through multiple application of the microclimate simulation model ENVI-met. The resulting annual microclimate information is able to be applied in thermal simulation studies with TRNSYS to determine the course of the temperatures in a building over the year as well as the resulting annual cooling demand. 56 detailed 24h-simulation runs are performed to represent the climatic conditions each week of the year and four additional extreme climate situations. From the results of these ENVI-met calculations an 8760h-dataset is constructed as input for an annual thermal simulation study. The algorithm has been tested for 26 locations in China through comparison of the original dataset with a model representing a 'neutral' site environment for calibration. It then has been applied for urban context models with green coverage. Differences in maximum temperatures as well as the impact of the urban context on the annual cooling demand are reported for the 26 locations. From these results also the CO2-emission reduction potentials are calculated. © 2017 The Authors.","China; cooling energy demand; microclimate simulation; urban green","Air conditioning; Buildings; Emission control; Energy management; Gas emissions; Location; Urban planning; China; CO2 emission reduction; Cooling energy; microclimate simulation; Multiple applications; Surrounding buildings; Thermal building simulation; urban green; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029825308

The aim of this work is a reduction of NOxemissions of a previously published two-staged MGT combustor [1, 2], where the pilot stage of the combustor was identified as the main contributor to NOxemissions. The geometry optimization was carried out regarding the shape of the pilot dome and the interface between pilot and main stage in order to prevent the formation of high temperature recirculation zones. Both stages have been run separately to allow a detailed understanding of the flame stabilization within the combustor, its range of stable combustion, the interaction between both stages and the influence of the modified geometry. All experiments were conducted at atmospheric pressure and an air preheat temperature of 650 °C. The flame was analyzed in terms of shape, length and lift-off height, using OH∗ chemiluminescence images. Emission measurements for NOx, CO and UHC emissions were carried out. At a global air number of l= 2, a fuel split variation was carried out from 0 (only pilot-stage) to 1 (only main stage). The modification of the geometry lead to a decrease in N Ox and CO emissions throughout the fuel split variation in comparison with the previous design. Regarding CO emissions, the pilot stage operations is beneficial for a fuel split above 0.8. The local maximum in NOx emissions observed for the previous combustor design at a fuel split of 0.78 was not apparent for the modified design. N Ox emissions were increasing, when the local air number of the pilot stage was below the global air number. In order to evaluate the influence of the modified design on the flow field and identify the origin of the emission reduction compared to the previous design, unsteady RANS simulations were carried out for both geometries at fuel splits of 0.93 and 0.78, respectively, using the DLR in-house code THETA with the k-w SST turbulence model and the DRM22 [3] detailed reaction mechanism. The numerical results showed a strong influence of the recirculation zones on the pilot stage reaction zone. © 2017 ASME.","Combustor; FLOX®; Jet-stabilized; MGT; Swirl","Atmospheric pressure; Chemiluminescence; Combustion; Combustors; Emission control; Exhaust gases; Fuels; Gas emissions; Geometry; Nitrogen oxides; Oceanography; Turbomachinery; Turbulence models; Detailed reaction mechanisms; Efficient combustions; Emission measurement; Geometry optimization; Recirculation zones; SST turbulence models; Swirl; Unsteady-RANS simulations; Gas turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85030688544

Essential climate variables for the thermodynamic state of the free atmosphere, such as temperature and tropospheric water vapor profiles (involving background information), can be derived from these records, which consequentially have the potential to serve as climate benchmark data. In order to exploit this potential, atmospheric profile retrievals need to be very accurate and the remaining uncertainties need to be quantified and traced throughout the retrieval chain. The new Reference Occultation Processing System at the Wegener Center aims to deliver such an accurate retrieval chain with integrated uncertainty propagation. Here we introduce and demonstrate the algorithms implemented for uncertainty propagation from RO bending angle profiles to dry-air variables (pressure and temperature), for estimated random and systematic uncertainties, and for coestimates of observation-to-background weighting ratio profiles. We estimated systematic uncertainty profiles with the same operators as used for the basic profiles retrieval. The random uncertainty propagation was integrated by a covariance propagation approach and validated using Monte-Carlo ensemble methods. We present the results of the validation and demonstrate how the algorithm performs for individual simulated RO events and for ensembles of real RO events. We also compare the new results from the integrated uncertainty propagation to previous ones from empirical error analyses for RO-retrieved atmospheric profiles. We find that the new uncertainty estimation chain shows robust performance and is in good agreement with previous comparable results. © 2017.

Common measures to reduce the problem’s size and complexity are to reduce modeling accuracy, aggregate multiple loads or change the temporal resolution. However, since these attempts alter the optimization problem and consequently lead to different solutions as intended, this paper presents and analyses a decomposition method for solving the original problem iteratively. The decomposed method is validated by comparison with the original compact model formulation, proving that both models deviate by less than 1.8%. Both approaches furthermore lead to similar energy systems that are operated similarly, as well. The findings also show that the compact model formulation is only applicable to small- and medium-scale microgrids due to current limitations of computing resources and optimization algorithms, whereas the distributed approach is suitable for even large-scale microgrids. We apply the decomposed method to a large-scale microgrid in order to evaluate economic and ecological benefits of interconnected buildings inside the grid. The results show that with local electricity exchange, costs can be reduced by 4.0% and emissions by even 23.7% for the investigated scenario. © 2017 IMEKO","Building Energy System; Decomposition; Mixed Integer Linear Programming; Optimization","Computational complexity; Costs; Decomposition; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Iterative methods; Optimal systems; Optimization; Problem solving; Virtual storage; Building energy systems; Decentralized energy; Decomposition methods; Distributed approaches; Electricity exchanges; Mixed integer linear programming; Optimization algorithms; Optimization problems; Integer programming",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048603028

In this work, recently developed laser diagnostics for combustion temperature and the concentrations of CO, O2, and NO are applied to a diesel-like jet, using a highly oxygenated fuel. The diagnostic is based on spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) methods. Line imaging yields multiscalar profiles across the jet cross section. Measurements turn out to be particularly accurate, because near-stoichiometric combustion occurs in the central region of the jet. Thereby, experimental cross-influences by light attenuation and interfering emissions are greatly reduced compared to the combustion of conventional, sooting diesel fuel jets. This is achieved by fuel oxygenation and enhanced premixing. The second stage of ignition occurs relatively close to the end of fuel injection, so that the flame is similar to partially premixed, low-load, single-injection, low-temperature combustion (LTC) in heavy-duty engines. Since exhaust-gas recirculation (EGR) is not applied in this work, relatively high NO concentrations (~500 ppm) are found in the downstream jet. The origin of enhanced NO formation is investigated in more detail by the other measured scalars. The local equivalence ratio is estimated based on both the O2 and CO profiles. Temperature measurements yield further information for the interpretation of NO signals. Rapid leaning caused by the end of injection is indicated by the CO and O2 data, but the corresponding effect on temperature and NO appears to be weak.

To reduce the risk of exposure, Australian state governments develop candidate mitigation strategies outlining specific actions and interventions to reduce emissions of, and exposure to, air pollutants. However, a common challenge in air quality management lies in selecting the optimal control strategies from a potentially broad range of candidate strategies to mitigate exposure whilst adhering to budgetary requirements and national air quality standards. The complexity of this challenge is further compounded by the many different, incomparable types of uncertainty inherent to air quality analyses. To this end, optimisation models have been a commonly used tool in air quality management. However the majority of optimisation models presently available in the literature typically focus on minimising implementation costs alone, with limited consideration of uncertainty in model parameters. In this paper, a theoretical optimisation model is formulated and solved to accommodate for uncertainty to some extent in model parameters and the optimal solution. The developed model is applied in an air pollution context to identify cost-effective strategies to potentially reduce pollution exposure, with the objective of maximising the estimated societal health benefits, rather than implementation costs alone, under uncertainty. Within the model, the inherent spatiotemporal uncertainty of emission analyses can be represented, to an extent, through the combination of traditional linear programming techniques with the principles of fuzzy logic. This is an attractive modelling approach as fuzzy logic allows for imprecise model parameters. The developed model is solved using a fuzzy linear complementary problem approach with Lemke’s pivoting algorithm. The numeric model output is complemented with maps of the model results, including health impact maps showing the expected number of adverse health episodes potentially avoided through the implementation of the optimal solution. These maps allow for simple, quick interpretation of the model results and easy identification of areas with the greatest, and least, potential for health impact. The use and format of model results are demonstrated through an application to Adelaide, South Australia, under sample emission scenarios. The performance of the developed fuzzy model is evaluated through a comparison against the corresponding ‘crisp’ model wherein all model parameters are assumed to be precisely defined. The results indicate that the fuzzy model is able to identify a cost-effective control strategy, or combination of strategies, to potentially reduce pollution exposure within the limited context of the sample application. Results are consistent between the developed fuzzy model and the corresponding crisp model however the fuzzy model has the additional advantageous feature of representing parameter uncertainty to some extent through the provision of upper and lower limits on the model results. There are complex processes beyond the scope of the developed theoretical model which impact on emission analyses. However the developed optimisation model is a step towards an accountable framework for air quality managers to aid the selection of cost-effective mitigation strategies that maximise the health benefits to society while accommodating, to an extent, for the associated uncertainty. © 2017 Proceedings - 22nd International Congress on Modelling and Simulation, MODSIM 2017.

This has precipitated change in the way practitioners are thinking of delivering eldercare services, especially in the public sector. In Norway, innovation scholars, the Norwegian government, and most municipalities delivering eldercare services agree that they must innovate to meet upcoming demands. However, infrastructural impacts are not expected for 15 years. Thus, the more difficult question becomes when a change is so distant, when or with whom should you innovate? The purpose of this paper is to determine innovative readiness by looking at group climate. Design/methodology/approach: The study will explore the differences between two groups within an organization: one group that participated (participant group) in formal innovation training and and the other group (nonparticipant group that did not participate in the training). The differences in each group’s climate will be explored using a t-test. Findings: There exist two identifiable group climates within the same organization. The participant group’s climate indicated that their members are ready for innovative change by showing that they are task oriented (C2), engaged (S1), and have an overall positive attitude toward innovation (A1 and A2). On the contrary, the nonparticipant group’s climate indicates that their members are not ready for innovative change. This group has a dominant role of acceptance (D2), rather than pursuing ideas or causes they believe in, they accept those tasks given to them. Each group’s level of innovation understanding was relatively similar prior to any formal training. Originality/value: This research shows that even though a manager within an organization is championing or encouraging innovative behavior, there can still exist two different group climates: a group that is genuinely interested in innovation and one that is not. Should participation in innovation training be mandatory or voluntary? This study showed the latter that the participant group’s climate indicated its members were more ready for innovative change, while the nonparticipant group’s climate indicated its members were not. This could be an important group dynamic for managers to consider when building a new innovative initiative, especially if that organization struggles with maintaining engagement and positivity for that change. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Change management; Climate; Innovation; Organizational readiness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018725060

Accordingly, the focus in automotive development shifts to the use of alternative energies for vehicle propulsions in order to reduce emissions. The amount of emission reduction by using alternative drive systems depends on marginal conditions, such as the energy mix structure, climate conditions and the vehicle's usage profile. The individual usage profile contains characteristic values such as the number of trips, trip duration and length, as well as the velocity distribution. These characteristic data are individual for each user and differ from the values derived through test cycles such as e.g. the NEDC or the JC08. Accordingly, for the current market analysis and future trends prediction, different user profiles have to be considered and analysed. Within this paper, real world driving data recorded within the German project RuhrautoE will be analysed. The focus lies on evaluation criteria that differentiate between countries due to local framework conditions. In this context, the costs and emissions of different propulsion systems are compared between Germany and China. Afterwards an outlook on Malaysia is given for these criteria. Hitherto, such an approach is rarely considered for Malaysia. Conventional and alternative fuel vehicles as well as electrified vehicles (EV) are compared within this paper. All car models considered are based on real vehicle series to ensure a valid common basis. As expected, the consumptions of all analysed propulsion systems are higher for real driving data than for the NEDC. Then the consumption costs of the electric vehicle are the lowest in Germany and China, but not in Malaysia, where a gas driven vehicle (LPG) achieves the best results. Though, while electric cars can reduce well-to-wheel emissions by 82 % in Germany, there is no reduction possible in China as long as the fossil proportion during the generation of electricity is not reduced. However, EV can reduce the local emission in high traffic areas. According to our estimation, EV are not profitable in all considered countries due to the Total Cost of Ownership. © Universiti Malaysia Pahang Publishing.","China; Drive train; Driving pattern; Electric mobility; Green energy technology; Malaysia; Total cost of ownership",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028505073

Utilizing efficiency potentials of combined heat and power (CHP) and integrating (industrial) waste heat and renewable energy contents within these grids, low temperature (and low-ex) heat sources might be exploited. Thus, energetic contents unsuitable for electrical energy supply are utilized in order to diminish greenhouse gas emissions and minimize primary energy needs. Distribution of heat requires accurate planning and network design for the expected service time of several decades. This applies for existing networks as well as for future networks. During planning and conception different load scenarios (of today and in future) must be considered. Since the design of existing networks was done in the past, this paper focusses on the requirements for the conception and planning of heating networks in the near future. Because of low temperature (and low-ex) heat sources, the expansion of district heating networks in EU will be linked to modifications in the network design and planning. A sensitivity analysis was carried out for relevant input parameters in low temperature networks. The analysis showed a significant influence of the conductivity of the bedding material as well as the overburden height on heat losses. For the given set of reference parameters, the energy efficiency potential of systems for heat distribution is approximately 10 %. ©2017 The Authors.

Pacific Islands have been identified as being amongst the countries most vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change. The purpose of this paper is to describe impacts of climate change on food and nutrition security in Pacific Island countries, the mechanisms linking climate change and nutrition, and strategies and policies to address them. Method: A literature review and documentary analysis was undertaken. Case materials from Pacific Island countries are used to illustrate both climate change impacts and promising strategies. Results: Climate change exacerbates the existing burden of malnutrition. Food and nutrition security are affected through changes in local food production and transition from traditional nutritious diets to dependence on less nutritious imported foods, undermining efforts to reduce hunger and promote nutrition. Undernutrition, in turn, weakens climate resilience and the coping strategies of vulnerable populations. Nutrition-sensitive adaptation and mitigation measures, climate-resilient and nutrition-sensitive agriculture development, improved maternal and child care and health, and both community development and food system resilience measures are proposed as means to address the impacts of climate change on food and nutrition security. Conclusion: Pacific Island countries should not face these challenges alone. Strengthened global, regional and community responses to organize better preparedness, adaptation and mitigation against climate change and its impact on nutrition in Pacific island countries is needed. Specific opportunities to address these issues in the Pacific will be presented. © 2017 American Scientific Publishers All rights reserved.","Climate change; Food and nutrition security; Pacific island countries; Small island developing states",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021169701

The Vienna region possesses 40% to 60% of these capacity values. At the same time, the metropolitan area of Vienna has one of the largest district heating systems in Europe. This is why the use of hydrothermal geothermal energy plays a key role in the supply strategy of the Vienna metropolitan area (see Climate Protection Program of the City of Vienna and Vienna Urban Development Plan (STEP 2025)). However, the future use of this heat source depends on efficient exploration and implementation concepts that do not yet exist. A new scientific project will overcome these conceptual gaps. Based on research results in the wider Vienna area, a ""Flagship Region for geothermal energy exploration"" will be developed for other Austrian regions. Three-dimensional subsurface properties will be characterized using geophysical methods. Together with geological and reservoir data, these will be pooled and visualized within a 3D data cube.

A decision by the US Supreme Court rejected this based on the two available methods having a burdensome cost basis. Moreover, even if the activated charcoal or bromine addition methods do become standard in the US, their cost may still inhibit global implementation. As a result it is timely to develop alternate methods. This paper outlines further development of such an approach. It is based on mercury's own chemistry. Previous published work discovered that elemental mercury, although volatile, has a propensity for heterogeneous chemistry on warm non-catalytic surfaces. This paper now reports results of a second pilot plant test continuing its clarification, extension and further validation of practicality. It extends data to inexpensive base metal surfaces that can be used and indicates the extent of mercury control possible. This non-catalytic heterogeneous chemistry has been overlooked due to this disguising role of surfaces. It is this that now suggests a passive mitigation method, natural to the system. By providing inserted metal surfaces in the downstream flue gas flow, mercury can be chemically modified and controlled. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Coal combustion; Mercury control; Non-catalytic; Passive method; Pilot plant testing; Surface chemistry","Emission control; Environmental Protection Agency; Flow of gases; Pilot plants; Surface chemistry; Chemically modified; Heterogeneous chemistry; Mercury control; Mercury emission control; Non-catalytic; Passive methods; Pilot-plant testing; US Environmental Protection Agency; Coal combustion; charcoal; chemistry; coal combustion; emission control; environmental protection; mercury (element); power plant; standard (reference); United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85010716322

In GPCC's 2011-release, a bulk climatological correction was applied to compensate for gauge undercatch. In this paper we derive an improved correction approach based on the synoptic weather reports for the period 1982-2015. The compared results show that the climatological approach tends to overestimate the correction for Central and Eastern Europe, especially in the northern winter, and in other regions throughout the year. Applying the mean weather-dependent correction to the GPCC's uncorrected precipitation climatology for 1951-2000 gives a value of 854.7 mm of precipitation per year (excluding Antarctica) or 790 mm for the global land surface. The warming of nearly 1 K relative to pre-industrial temperatures is expected to be accompanied by a 2%-3% increase in global (land and ocean) precipitation. However, a comparison of climatology for 30-year reference periods from 1931-1960 up to 1981-2010 reveals no significant trend for land surface precipitation. This may be caused by the large variability of precipitation, the varying data coverage over time and other issues related to the sampling of rain-gauge networks. The GPCC continues to enlarge and further improve the quality of its database, and will generate precipitation analyses with homogeneous data coverage over time. Another way to reduce the sampling issues is the combination of rain gauge-based analyses with remote sensing (i.e., satellite or radar) datasets. © 2017 by the authors.","Climate change; Global precipitation; Global water cycle; Rain-gauge undercatch correction","Climate change; Climatology; Gages; Rain; Rain gages; Remote sensing; Surface measurement; Central and Eastern Europe; Climatological correction; Corrected precipitation; Correction approaches; Global precipitation; Global water cycle; Precipitation climatology; Rain gauges; Precipitation (meteorology); climate change; hydrological cycle; land surface; precipitation (climatology); raingauge; regional climate; Central Europe; Eastern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015084703

We interpolate between two concepts for balancing the variability of these renewable sources: balancing at continental scales using the transmission grid and balancing locally with storage. This interpolation is done by systematically restricting transmission capacities from the optimum level to zero. We run techno-economic cost optimizations for the capacity investment and dispatch of wind, solar, hydroelectricity, natural gas power generation and transmission, as well as storage options such as pumped-hydro, battery, and hydrogen storage. The simulations assume a 95% CO2 emission reduction compared to 1990, and are run over a full historical year of weather and electricity demand for 30 European countries. In the cost-optimal system with high levels of transmission expansion, energy generation is dominated by wind (65%) and hydro (15%), with average system costs comparable to today's system. Restricting transmission shifts the balance in favour of solar and storage, driving up costs by a third. As the restriction is relaxed, 85% of the cost benefits of the optimal grid expansion can be captured already with only 44% of the transmission volume. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission reduction targets; Energy system design; Large-scale integration of renewable power generation; Power transmission","Carbon dioxide; Costs; Electric power transmission; Emission control; Hydrogen storage; Investments; Photovoltaic cells; Solar energy; CO2 emission reduction; Emission reduction targets; Energy system design; Natural gas power generations; Renewable power generation; Solar photovoltaic power generations; Transmission capacities; Transmission expansion; Solar power generation; carbon dioxide; design; distribution system; electricity generation; electricity industry; emission control; energy planning; hydroelectric power; investment; natural gas; photovoltaic system; renewable resource; smart grid; solar power; storage; wind power; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020936368

Existing energy- and climate-economic modeling approaches that are informing policy and decision makers in shaping the future net-zero emissions society are increasingly seen with skepticism regarding their ability to forecast the long-term evolution of highly complex, nonlinear social-ecological systems. We present a structured review of state-of-the-art modeling approaches, focusing on their ability and limitations to develop and assess pathways towards a low-carbon society. We find that existing methodological approaches have some fundamental deficiencies that limit their potential to understand the subtleties of long-term low-carbon transformation processes. We suggest that a useful methodological framework has to move beyond current state of the art techniques and has to simultaneously fulfill the following requirements: (1) representation of an inherent dynamic analysis, describing and investigating explicitly the path between different states of system variables, (2) specification of details in the energy cascade, in particular the central role of functionalities and services that are provided by the interaction of energy flows and corresponding stock variables, (3) reliance on a clear distinction between structures of the sociotechnical energy system and socioeconomic mechanisms to develop it and (4) ability to evaluate pathways along societal criteria. To that end we propose the development of a versatile multi-purpose integrated modeling framework, building on the specific strengths of the various modeling approaches available while at the same time omitting their weaknesses. This paper identifies respective strengths and weaknesses to guide such development. © 2017 Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Centro de Ciencias de la Atmósfera.","Climate-economic modeling; Energy-economic modeling; Low-carbon transformation; Structured literature review","carbon emission; climate modeling; global warming; greenhouse gas; literature review; transformation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029797082

Their market uptake, however, is still staying below expectations in most countries across Europe, due to monetary and non-monetary barriers. Besides monetary incentives, different non-monetary policy measures to promote electric mobility are either discussed or already in place. Since the different monetary incentives across Europe have proven to be not equally effective in the support of the electric vehicle market uptake, it is expected that non-monetary policy measures will not express the same impact level in different countries, too. Therefore, the project “Incentives for Cleaner Vehicles in Urban Europe” (I-CVUE) aims to understand the efficacy of policy measures that promote electric vehicles in Europe. In order to gain a deeper understanding a stated preference survey was executed that focusses on studying the value of policy measures and further non-monetary aspects of electric vehicle ownership. The online survey was directed at vehicle drivers and fleet managers in Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, The United Kingdom, and Spain. Based on the obtained data, country-specific willingness-to-pay values are deducted, which can be used to assess the utility of electric vehicles.

Due to the climate policy of the European Union (EU) and the corresponding implementation of strategies to achieve its objectives defined by the member states, the installed capacity of generation units based on renewable energy sources (RES) has made a significant development, particularly in Germany, in recent years. Furthermore, the integration of national energy markets towards one common European market creates an increase of power flows between control areas. These changes have an impact, among others, on operational planning and real-time operation processes given the fact that these processes benefit from experience gained by TSOs in past decades, which is not fully compatible with the new situations arising. Hence, additional tools to support the assessment of the state of the system during both processes can help to mitigate the challenges caused by those situations, which did not appear in the past. The methodology presented in this paper provides the basis for the assessment of the structural characteristics of all branches of a transmission network. Using a graph theoretic measure and considering electrical characteristics such as the impedance as weights, the lines are assessed regarding their relative sensitivity to potential violations of operational limits. The result of the assessment is a ranking of all lines for a defined configuration (i.e. switching state) of the network. This ranking can serve as an input for various applications e.g. for the comparison of different switching states in the operational planning process. Given the fact that the use of the system has a direct impact on the loading of lines and is not considered by methodology presented, the ranking can support but not replace calculations and analyses determining the state of the system. Exemplary analyses are carried out on an IEEE 118-bus test system. The ranking is evaluated by comparing it with the ranking obtained from load-flow calculations for different system use cases. The results obtained show that the methodology provides a valuable input for operators. However, the final proof of the concept has to be provided by testing the methodology on a system of realistic size and with realistic system use cases and switching states. © ETG Congress 2017 - Die Energ.

Older coal fired electrical plants are being phased out rather than upgraded and new electrical generation capacity needs are increasingly being filled by natural gas fired plants and renewable sources. In addition, the use of coal to produce liquid fuels is also not economically feasible in the current oil and gas market with increased supplies and decreased demand for oil and gas. As a result, the University of Wyoming, with help from the state of Wyoming, is looking for new and novel ways to utilize its huge coal resources. One of the processes under study is the solvent extraction of coal to produce chemicals and other products. A byproduct of this liquid extraction process is the residue left behind after removal of the solvent soluble material. A potential method for utilization of the remaining solvent extraction residue is gasification. Syngas produced from gasification could be used as a source of energy as well as a source of hydrogen, via the water-gas shift reaction, for coal upgrading processes. Limited data is available regarding the ease of gasification of this residue, especially for low rank coals such as Wyoming PRB coal. There has also been little investigation into the kinetics of the residue gasification and how they compare with those of the unprocessed coal. In this study, soluble compounds were extracted from PRB coal using an organic solvent at temperatures and pressures representative of those used in a coal solvent extraction process. Extraction of the coal sample continued until the solvent passing through the sample lightened, indicating that most of the soluble material had been removed. The remaining residue was dried and then gasified in a modified drop-tube reactor at various temperatures and pressures. Carbon dioxide or steam were used as gasification agents. Results were then used to fit kinetic models to the gasification process. The results were compared with those obtained from gasification of untreated PRB coal to see the relative ease of gasification of the extraction residues. In addition, surface area analyses of the residue and char formed from the residue were performed and compared to those for PRB coal. SEM images were also taken. Results of these studies should provide important information about the possible use of residues remaining after coal solvent extraction processes, especially for sub-bituminous coals such as Wyoming PRB. The data will aid in the determination of gasification conditions required to effectively convert the residue into syngas and thus aid in determining the type of gasifier which would be most effective for this purpose. Overall, these results could help make solvent extraction processes more feasible since the remaining residue could be used effectively and possibly provide needed energy and hydrogen for coal conversion processes. © 2017 34th Annual International Pittsburgh Coal Conference: Coal - Energy, Environment and Sustainable Development, PCC 2017.

For example, groups at the NASA Langley Research Center rely on stable visible- and infraredchannel calibrations in order to understand the temporal/spatial distribution of hazardous storms, as determined from an automated overshooting convective top detection algorithm. Therefore, in order to facilitate reliable, climate-quality retrievals, it is important that consistent calibration coefficients across satellite platforms are made available to the remote sensing community, and that calibration anomalies are recognized and mitigated. One such anomaly is the infrared imager brightness temperature (BT) drift that occurs for some Geostationary Earth Orbit satellite (GEOsat) instruments near local midnight. Currently the Global Space-Based Inter-Calibration System (GSICS) community uses the hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) sensor as a common reference to uniformly calibrate GEOsat IR imagers. However, the combination of IASI, which has a 21:30 local equator crossing time (LECT), and hyperspectral Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS; 01:30 LECT) observations are unable to completely resolve the GEOsat midnight BT bias. The precessing orbit of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Visible and Infrared Scanner (VIRS), however, allows sampling of all local hours every 46 days. Thus, VIRS has the capability to quantify the BT midnight effect observed in concurrent GEOsat imagers. First, the VIRS IR measurements are evaluated for long-term temporal stability between 2002 and 2012 by inter-calibrating with Aqua-MODIS. Second, the VIRS IR measurements are assessed for diurnal stability by inter-calibrating with Meteosat-9 (Met-9), a spin-stabilized GEOsat imager that does not manifest any diurnal dependency. In this case, the Met-9 IR imager is first adjusted with the official GSICS calibration coefficients. Then VIRS is used as a diurnal calibration reference transfer to produce hourly corrections of GEOsat IR imager BT. For the 9 three-axis stabilized GEO imagers concurrent with VIRS, the midnight effect increased the BT on average by 0.5 K (11 μm) and 0.4 K (12 μm), with a peak at ∼01:00 local time. As expected, the spin-stabilized GEOsats revealed a smaller diurnal temperature cycle (mostly < 0.2 K) with inconsistent peak hours. © 2017 SPIE.",,"Calibration; Earth (planet); Geodetic satellites; Geostationary satellites; Infrared devices; Infrared imaging; Infrared instruments; NASA; Optical sensors; Rain; Rain gages; Remote sensing; Space optics; Weather forecasting; Weather satellites; Atmospheric infrared sounders; Calibration coefficients; Diurnal temperature cycles; Geostationary earth orbit satellites; Infrared atmospheric sounding interferometers; NASA Langley Research Center; Tropical rainfall measuring missions; Visible and infrared scanners; Orbits",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85038905174

Concerns about justice have become increasingly prominent in forest management objectives across a range of governance initiatives—from state-controlled forests to community forestry and REDD+ (Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation) development. However, there remains a considerable gap between theoretical and public conceptions of justice as to its institutionalisation and practical operationalisation. With a detailed case study of Nepal’s community forestry and REDD+ processes, this paper analyses whether and how the ideas of justice are applied in forest governance. In particular, it assesses justice implications of policy processes and outcomes, including the Forest Act (1993), Forestry Sector Strategy (2014), Forest Policy (2015), and REDD+ Strategy (First Draft, 2015) and discusses the opportunities and challenges of addressing issues of justice and forest peoples’ rights through community forestry and REDD+ in Nepal. In so doing, this paper also draws some useful insights on how to link twin agendas of justice and sustainability in forest management. © Common Ground, Poshendra Satyal, All Rights Reserved.","Community Forestry; Forest Policy; Justice; Nepal; REDD+; Rights",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054008460

Three different composite indices were used to assess the vulnerability of smallholder farmers to climate changes: Livelihood Vulnerability Index, Livelihood Vulnerability Index-Intergovernmental Penal on Climate Change, and Livelihood Effect Index. The weakness of social networks in Rawalpindi district is majorly important to enable the adoption of appropriate mitigating strategies. For both districts, lack of education had the highest effect on social vulnerability. Adoption of strategies towards mitigation of climate changes seems to be possible by the respondents in Chakwal district, with higher illiteracy rate, higher dependency ratio, and greater financial vulnerability. The natural and financial capital had the highest impact on the livelihoods of smallholder farmers in both districts.

We calculate the primary energy, carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane (CH4) emission profiles, and the cumulative radiative forcing (CRF) of different systems that produce the same amount of electricity. We find that using slash or waste for electricity production instead of coal somewhat increases the instantaneous CO2emission from the power plant, but avoids significant subsequent emissions from decaying slash in forests or waste in landfills. For slash used instead of coal, we find robust near- and long-term reductions in total emissions and CRF. Climate effects of using waste instead of coal are more ambiguous: CRF is reduced when CCS is used, but without CCS there is little or no climate benefits of using waste directly for energy, assuming that landfill gas is recovered and used for electricity production. The application of CCS requires more fuel, but strongly reduces the CO2emissions. The use of slash or waste together with CCS results in negative net emissions and CRF, i.e. global cooling. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture and storage; Forest residues; Fuel substitution; Landfill; Radiative forcing","Atmospheric radiation; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal storage; Electric power generation; Forestry; Land fill; Metal recovery; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Electricity production; Emission profile; Forest residue; Fuel substitution; Primary energies; Radiative forcings; Scale conversions; Municipal solid waste; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; coal; electricity generation; landfill; methane; municipal solid waste; power plant; radiative forcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85011891091

This chapter focuses on the South Asia region, with particular emphasis on India and Bangladesh, as these are two countries faced with high vulnerability to climate change. It is clear that the increased level of projected growth in the region needs to tread down a path towards a low carbon economy, in order to face up to the challenges of climate change. Inadequate regional cooperation, energy insecurity and weak governance are identified as key impediments to achieving a low carbon economy in South Asia. However, some progress has been made through the formation of climate change specific policy, establishment of forums for regional cooperation, and private sector initiatives, promoting sustainable practices. The step from policy and ideas to action needs to be taken. Barriers such as, political instability, lack of economic integration and limited natural resources need to be acknowledged and surmounted before any real progress towards sustainable development in the region can be achieved. The promotion of a low carbon economy is touted as a key step in the right direction. Emerging from this literature review is a series of examples and mechanisms that may help in the formulation of coordinated and integrated policy and mechanisms that would be needed to see real progress towards low carbon economy and an effective response to the challenges derived from climate change in South Asia. © Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2017.","Climate change; Low carbon economy; South Asia",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071435577

The benefits are gained from energy arbitrage, peaking power generation, energy loss reduction, system upgrade deferral, emission reduction and VAr support. A cost-benefit analysis is also conducted to identify the optimal Net Present Value (NPV), Discounted Payback Period (DPP) and Benefit-Cost ratio (BCR). Moreover, an optimal power factor approach is included in the analysis to dispatch CES units to improve load factors and voltage profiles. The probabilistic distribution of solar irradiance is also incorporated in the proposed strategy to consider the uncertainty of PV generation. Several sensitivity analyses are carried out to investigate the effects of PV penetration, load models and the number of CES units deployed on the profitability of CES investment.

In order to fully exploit the potential of the abovementioned fuel injection pattern optimization, numerical simulation can play a fundamental role by allowing the creation of a kind of a virtual injection rate generator for the assessment of the corresponding engine outputs in terms of combustion characteristics such as burn rate, emission formation and combustion noise (CN). This paper is focused on the analysis of the effects of digitalization of pilot events in the injection pattern on Brake Specific Fuel Consumption (BSFC), CN and emissions for a EURO 6 passenger car 4-cylinder diesel engine. The numerical evaluation was performed considering steady-state conditions for 3 key points representative of typical operating conditions in the low-medium load range. The optimization process was carried out through numerical simulation, by means of a suitable target function aiming to minimize BSFC and CN while not exceeding the target NOx emissions level. By means of a previously developed fuel injection system model, possible different injection patterns with high number of pilot injections were evaluated thus obtaining a kind of virtual injection rate generator, the outcomes of which were then used as input for a DIPulse combustion model in order to predict BSFC, combustion noise and emissions. Through numerical optimization of pilot injection pattern digitalization, potential for achieving significant reductions in BSFC and CN for low load engine points while not exceeding the target NOx emissions level, was demonstrated.

Two Continuously Stirred Tank Reactors (CSTR), fed with fresh (CSTR-C) and heat pre-treated (CSTR-T) Chlorella biomass were run in parallel in order to determine methane productions. The methane yield was 1.5 times higher in CSTR-T with regard to CSTR-C. Aiming to understand the microorganism roles within of the reactors, the sludge used as an inoculum (I), plus raw (CSTR-C) and heat pre-treated (CSTR-T) samples were analyzed by high-throughput pyrosequencing. The bacterial communities were dominated by Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi and Firmicutes. Spirochaetae and Actinobacteria were only detected in sample I. Proteobacteria, mainly Alfaproteobacteria, were by far the dominant phylum within of the CSTR-C bioreactor. Many of the sequences retrieved were related to bacteria present in activated sludge treatment plants and they were absent after thermal pre-treatment. Most of the sequences affiliated to the Bacteroidetes were related to uncultured groups. Anaerolineaceae was the sole family found of the Chloroflexi phylum. All of the genera identified of the Firmicutes phylum carried out macromolecule hydrolysis and by-product fermentation. The proteolytic bacteria were prevalent over the saccharolytic microbes. The percentage of the proteolytic genera increased from the inoculum to the CSTR-T sample in a parallel fashion with an available protein increase owing to the high protein content of Chlorella. To relate the taxa identified by high-throughput sequencing to their functional roles remains a future challenge. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Biomethanization; Chlorella vulgaris; Microalgae; Pyrosequencing; Thermal pre-treatment","Activated sludge process; Algae; Anaerobic digestion; Biomass; Methane; Proteins; Biomethanization; Chlorella vulgaris; Micro-algae; Pyrosequencing; Thermal pre-treatment; Bacteria; ammonia; methane; nitrogen; biofuel; sewage; activated sludge; anaerobic digestion; bacterium; biofuel; biomass; bioreactor; feeding; fermentation; functional role; hydrolysis; methanogenesis; microalga; microbial community; Actinobacteria; activated sludge; Alfaproteobacteria; anaerobic digestion; Anaerolineaceae; Article; Bacteroidetes; Bacteroidia; biomethanization; Campylobacteraceae; Chlorella vulgaris; Chloroflexi; Christensenellaceae; Clostridia; Comamonadaceae; continuously stirred tank reactor; controlled study; Firmicutes; Gammaproteobacteria; Gracilaria; heating; Helicobacteraceae; high throughput sequencing; hydrolysis; inoculation; Intrasporangiaceae; macromolecule; microalga; microbial biomass; microbial community; microbial diversity; microwave radiation; nitrogen mineralization; nonhuman; Peptostreptococcaceae; phylum; Porphyromonadaceae; Propionibacteriaceae; protein content; pyrosequencing; Rhodobacteraceae; Rhodocyclaceae; Rikenellaceae; Ruminococcaceae; Sphingobacteriia; Spirochaeta; Spirochaetaceae; Spirochaetales Incertae Sedis; stirred reactor; Syntrophaceae; upflow reactor; waste water management; Zoogloea; bacterium; biomass; bioreactor; biosynthesis; Chlorella; fermentation; heat; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; Proteobacteria; sewage; Actinobacteria; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; Chlorella vulgaris; Chloroflexi; Chloroflexi (class); Firmicutes; Proteobacteria; Spirochaetes; Bacteria; Bacteroidetes; Biofuels; Biomass; Bioreactors; Chlorella; Chloroflexi; Fermentation; Hot Temperature; Hydrolysis; Methane; Microalgae; Proteobacteria; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85006867312

While shared mobility has immense potential to improve the efficiency of personal transport and, hence, reduce emissions, this paper makes the case that shared mobility per se is not sufficient to achieve this important goal. Rather, shared mobility services should be designed and integrated with other transport modes having carbon emission reduction as an explicit optimisation goal. This observation prompts a call for the development of accurate models and analytical tools for the estimation of the city-level benefits of different forms of shared mobility, and of their integration.

The environmental benefits of air plant green roofs had been measured under the similar environmental circumstance in hot and humid climate in Thailand. The Crassulacian Acid Metabolism (CAM) or xerophyte and epiphyte plants were selected and used in the air plant green roof. It was found out that those plants required less maintenance. However, two common species of CAM plants in this study are air plants which are Spanish moss and Tillandsia cotton candy. With that reason, the classifications of green roofs have been represented by different environmental benefits.

The consequences of climate change have prompted progressive governments such as British Columbia to establish legislative GHG emission reductions targets, which have lead to energy conscience municipalities within the province voluntarily committing to helping achieve such targets. Best practices examined from European municipalities share a common theme of renewable energy adoption and municipally-owned utilities. An emerging renewable energy technology are tidal current turbines (TCTs), which function to extract kinetic energy from the lateral movement of the tides in areas with considerable tidal velocities. This paper examines the history, physics, operational parameters, and plausible environmental impacts of TCTs in order to make a case for their sustainable implementation. The feasibility of the municipalities of North Pender Island, South Pender Island, and Saturna of the Southern Gulf Islands Region (SGIR), British Columbia, to help meet established GHG emissions reduction targets through the implementation of TCTs is analyzed, demonstrating that the deployment of 10 TCTs can produce 38,266,602 kWh/yr of electricity, mitigating 1138 t of CO2e, achieving 9.9% of the cumulative municipal GHG emissions mitigation targets. The paper then examines a case study in the Shetland Islands and Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters, Scotland, suggesting that jurisdictional regulatory powers over TCT installation and operation be devolved from the British Columbia government to the municipal governments of North Pender Island, South Pender Island, and Saturna, so that such communities can reap the benefits associated with a municipally-owned utility. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Municipal electrical utility; Renewable energy; Tidal current turbines","Climate change; Emission control; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Ocean currents; Turbines; Electrical utilities; Global climate changes; Municipal government; Municipally owned utilities; Operational parameters; Renewable energies; Renewable energy technologies; Tidal currents; Tidal power",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85015001421

However, it is still valuable as a regional traveler information and communication tool, especially in emergencies. To understand the benefits of HAR to professional agencies, two online surveys were conducted with state department of transportation officials throughout the United States and with Florida emergency management departments. The 28 completed state department of transportation surveys indicated that HAR was a valuable regional communication tool to reach more travelers and provided more detailed information than other technologies. Florida emergency management professionals stated that HAR was useful as a redundant technology if the phone and Internet-based technologies that they used to provide emergency alerts failed. In addition to these surveys, a detailed benefit–cost analysis that used the results of customer surveys was performed on the HAR system of the Florida’s Turnpike Enterprise, which consisted of 16 HAR units throughout Florida. This analysis quantified the regional travel time benefits to passenger vehicle occupants and commercial truck drivers who diverted because of HAR congestion messages and compared these benefits with the capital and operational costs of the system. Assuming that 5% to 20% of HAR congestion messages cause diversion, the estimated range of the HAR benefit–cost ratio was 4.02 to 16.08. These benefits would be even greater if use of HAR in emergencies, fuel savings, and emissions reductions were considered. © 2017, SAGE Publications Ltd.

At the regional level, the success of the Helsinki Protocol on reducing sulfur emissions is contrasted with the slower and less profound success of the Sofia Protocol on limiting nitrogen oxides. These paired comparisons demonstrate how effective international cooperation transcends the properties of public goods, thereby encompassing other identified drivers.

These changes could affect N and C compounds in the soil that in turn can influence soil microbial activity and processes involved in the emission of N oxides, methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2), but these effects have been scarcely studied. Through an open top chamber (OTC) field experiment, the combined effects of both pollutants on soil gas emissions from an annual experimental Mediterranean community were assessed. Four O3 treatments and three different N input levels were considered. Fluxes of nitric (NO) and nitrous (N2O) oxide, CH4 and CO2 were analysed as well as soil mineral N and dissolved organic carbon. Belowground plant parameters like root biomass and root C and N content were also sampled. Ozone strongly increased soil N2O emissions, doubling the cumulative emission through the growing cycle in the highest O3 treatment, while N-inputs enhanced more slightly NO; CH4 and CO2 where not affected. Both N-gases had a clear seasonality, peaking at the start and at the end of the season when pasture physiological activity is minimal; thus, higher microorganism activity occurred when pasture had a low nutrient demand. The O3-induced peak of N2O under low N availability at the end of the growing season was counterbalanced by the high N inputs.

The study will determine the effectiveness of the UVVRP in not only the reduction of traffic congestion in Metro Manila but also the atmospheric air quality. Air quality has been drastically declining due to the emissions brought by mobile sources. The results in this study have shown that transport policies and air pollution regulations would have a very significant impact on urban transport inefficiencies like congestion. Methods The researchers need to estimate the unknown parameters. A regression analysis must be carried out to avoid the risk of autocorrelation of errors between explanatory variables. In order to avoid this, we used the Two Stage Least Squares (TSLS) method to determine the impact of the UVVRP on air pollution based on time-series data at the metro-wide level. Simultaneity problems also exist. The econometric specifications estimated the instrumental variables which was only correlated to the explanatory variables. Results/Conclusions/Contributions Based on the research, since congestion has an insignificant impact on air pollution and the current specification of UVVRP does not greatly impact the congestion, thr UVVRP policy does not impact the air pollution in Metro Manila. This is opposite to the UVVRP version in other countries where it aims in reducing air pollution. The researchers suggest modifying the coding scheme by reducing the vehicle usage from once a week into an odd-even scheme. This may be drastic but it certainly calls for the situation given that there is a lot of current infrastructure construction. This study would interest any polices that are related to addressing congestion and pollution problems.","Air pollution; Congestion; Fuel Price; Two-stage least squares method; UVVRP",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026514329

According to climate responsive approach, the interactive and adaptive relationship between building, site, and climate consider a basic rule to reduce the environmental impact and improving energy efficiency in buildings. In recent decades this concept has extended to the preservation of the cultural identity of the places. High level of adaptive, sustainable and functional performances could be deduced from the traditional residential buildings as the case of Aleppo proves. The traditional Arab house in Aleppo is based on series of adaptive and sustainable-oriented principles derived from the integration of active and interactive design approaches. The old city of Aleppo (included in the UNESCO List of World Heritage Sites) is considered one of the largest historical cities in the world, in terms of its population number (110,000 people before the war). The damage to cultural and historical heritage by the war asserts the peculiarity of the city in the Eastern Mediterranean area. This paper presents the study that the authors are carrying out on Aleppo, considering the bioclimatic approach as a key element to reorient the future construction process of the Syrian city to achieve the objectives of global sustainability and identify design criteria's for the development of the residential buildings. The study also aims to analyse the mutations which appeared through evolution process of residential buildings and identify the invariant elements and the main trajectories of modification established in the past, confirming their compatibility with the future development of Aleppo. © 2017 The Authors.

There is a need to understand these relationships better in the context of international policy on Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). The article reviews the way in which shifting cultivation has been incorporated in global and national estimations of carbon emissions, and assembles the available information on shifting cultivation in Tropical Dry Forests (TDF) in Mexico, where it is widely practiced. It then takes the case of two villages, Tonaya and El Temazcal, which lie within the basin of the River Ayuquila in Jalisco, Mexico. Field data for the typical carbon stocks and fluxes associated with shifting cultivation are compared with stocks and fluxes associated with more intensive agricultural production in the same dry tropical forest area to highlight the carbon sequestration dynamics associated with the shortening and potential lengthening of the fallow cycles. The biomass density in the shifting cultivation system observed can reach levels similar to that of old growth forests, with old fallows (>20 years) having higher carbon stocks than old growth forests. Per Mg of maize produced, the biomass-related emissions from shifting cultivation in the traditional 12 year cycle are about three times those from permanent cultivation. We did not, however, take into account the additional emissions from inputs that result from the use of fertilizers and pesticides in the case of permanent agriculture. Shortening of the fallow cycle, which is occurring in the study area as a result of government subsidies, results in higher remaining stocks of carbon and lower emissions at the landscape level. © 2017, Finnish Society of Forest Science.

HFCs are powerful greenhouse gases with a high global warming potential. Moreover, HFCs are commonly used as a refrigerant within secondary refrigeration processes for cold production. A solution to limit their negative environmental impact would be to reduce the amount of HFC by using a phase change slurries (PCS) in the secondary loop. A PCS is composed of solid phase change particles(solid-liquid) in a liquid transportation phase. Clathrate hydrates are crystalline particles where gas molecules are trapped in water cages. Due to their high energy densities, hydrate slurries, in particular CO2 hydrates, are relevant two-phase secondary fluids because they enhance the energy efficiency of secondary refrigeration systems. In this study, the rheological behaviour of CO2 hydrate slurries in various experimental conditions on a dynamic loop for cold distribution was investigated. An exhaustive state-of-the-art rheological study of hydrate slurries in aqueous solution has pointed out that hydrate slurries are non-Newtonian fluids. However, the rheological behaviour could be different for the same kind of hydrate slurry according to the literature. Moreover, the literature review also highlighted that the most used measurement method for the apparent viscosity is the capillary viscometer. We used a semi-empirical Herschel-Bulkley’s model for determining the apparent viscosity of the CO2 hydrate slurry as a function of the hydrate slurry fraction. This work is primordial for designing and sizing a new efficient refrigeration system based on this innovative material. © Lietuvos mokslų akademija, 2017.","CO2; Dynamic loop; Hydrate slurries; Rheology; Secondary refrigeration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035222392

This paper explores the interaction, in the public’s perception, between scientific knowledge and policies on climate change and water resources, a critical issue when making decisions based on scientific evidence. The study, which employed a qualitative paradigm, generated an interview guide which was administered to a sample of 26 subjects (13 researchers and 13 politicians). The analysis considered four dimensions: evidence, relevance, relationships and “supply and demand”. The political sector highlights a lack of information for drawing up policies. Researchers point out that they do not know the best strategies to transfer their results to the political world. In the relevance dimension, both groups (politicians and researchers) agree on the characteristics that define this knowledge and note that funding plays a significant role as one of the main elements hindering the science-policy interface. The relationships dimension stresses the need to generate fluid communication channels between the two sectors. In short, the process of science-policy interactions has important flaws due to several factors: the political system, the funding platform, the duration of projects, the length of political administrations, and centralism in connection with regional development. In summary, findings revealed that the interaction between science and policy on climate change issues is weak. Its of utmost importance the development of systematic dialogue opportunities associated with institutional commitments and the inclusion of stakeholders while prioritizing specific areas of the science-policy interface on the climate change issue. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Adaptation; Climate change; Drought; Science-policy interface",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071414046

This binder successfully improved the cyclability by fixing Si nanoparticles as the NE active material on the Cu foil current collector to resist the volume change caused by Li-Si alloying. After Li pre-doping, there were no cracks on the Si NE surfaces, which had been observed in previous work using sodium carboxymethyl cellulose binder. Furthermore, FEC addition into the electrolyte at Li pre-doping improved homogeneity of the Li-Si alloying. As a result, a large amount of Li was pre-doped to the Si NE and a lower open-circuit potential was maintained. A Si-CAP cell of [Li alloyed Si | activated carbon] using polyimide binder exhibited relatively stable charge/discharge behavior and cyclability was maintained up to 800 cycles.

A significant portion (37%) of GHG emissions in California comes from non-point sources (i.e. various modes of transportation). Terrestrial carbon storage (i.e. taking the advantage of inherent ability of certain tree species for storing carbon) for reducing the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is major GHG, from atmosphere is one of many ways to tackle the problem of GHG emissions resulting from non-point sources. In this project, research was focused on finding candidate trees that are drought resistant, native to California, and could continue to sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide in significant quantity over an extended period (&gt;100 years). Several forestry databases were searched for gathering a list of 37 candidate trees. The list was further narrowed downed to 13 which are fast-growing (i.e. reaching reported minimum height for a mature tree in 10 years or less time), emit low to moderate biogenic emissions, can grow in in USDA hardiness zone 8 or above, and have a width less than 20 ft when fully matured. Lastly, 7 candidate trees that are considered big as well as urban trees, are native to Southern California, were identified as the most suitable candidate trees for terrestrial carbon storage in regions with high air pollution and high water stress. Based on simplistic estimates of CO2 absorption per tree per year, it is estimated that a total of 186,000 acres of new forest comprising of top candidate trees identified in the study can help in achieving a 10% reduction in the GHG emissions occurring from transportation sector in the Kern County, California, and a 20% reduction in the Fresno County, California within 10 years of forestation. © 2017, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85050630434

Northern Hesse is a region in the middle of Germany with about one million inhabitants. Together with the two studies on energy transition, which are both focused on the electricity and the thermal sector, results for all essential energy industries are now available. The developed model represents the main influencing factors of the transport sector on energy consumption and CO2 emissions. The developed model makes use of available data and can be used as a basis for forecasts. The model is able to consider changes in urban structure, demography, mobility behavior and technical developments of vehicle systems. In addition to the status quo, a trend scenario and a scenario, where the state of sustainable mobility is assumed. The results of the study demonstrate that the transport sector can make a significant contribution to energy transition in the region. To reduce transport-related energy consumption and transport-related CO2 emissions, it is crucial that both presented strategies (automotive engineering and behaviorial change) will be implemented.

Wright St., Urbana, IL  61801, United States","This paper presents a physics-based macroscopic model for the description of non- equilibrium effects in CO2 flows. The starting point is the development of a vibrational state-to-state kinetic model including both vibrational excitation and dissociation processes for CO2 internal states. A reduced-order representation is formulated by grouping the vibrational states into a set of macroscopic bins. The novel aspect of this work is to use both the levels’ energy and the magnitude of their transition rates to generate these bins of vibrational states. The state population is then reconstructed from the macroscopic variables using bin-wise distribution functions based on the maximum entropy principle. A reduced system of governing equations is derived by taking successive moments of the fundamental microscopic equations without any ad-hoc assumptions. In order to fulfill the needs of practical multi-dimensional simulations, a set of kinetic and thermodynamic databases are constructed. The accuracy of the grouping strategy is assessed by analyzing the error introduced by the reduced-order models. It is found that the reduced-order state- to-state model can accurately reproduce the internal population and various macroscopic quantities, even for strong non-equilibrium conditions and a reduced number of bins. The reduced-order state-to-state model has been implemented in the US3D code and is applied to the Mars Science Laboratory entry. The conventional Boltzmann and the newly developed state-specific model are compared using a pure CO2 gas mixture. Both approaches shows very similar results in the forebody region of the spacecraft, while large discrepancies are observed in the backshell region, where non-Boltzmann effects become significant. © 2017, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc.

It has been estimated that 25% of these carbon emissions are generated from the buildings, especially from the electrical and mechanical equipment that are present in residential buildings. Malaysia's capital, Kuala Lumpur, has 81.5% of the high-rise buildings in the country and half of the buildings are residential. They have supposedly been designed as predominantly naturally ventilated, but the occupants had to add inefficient mechanical ventilation to achieve the required cooling. It is due to the lack of acknowledgement of the hot-humid climate of Malaysia by the current building regulations and the fact that the requirements for energy use are not customised for residential buildings. Recent developments concerning the use of green rating tools are helping to improve the sustainable design of buildings. This paper reviews these existing regulations and green rating tools and explores the full potential for natural ventilation in Kuala Lumpur, to substantially reduce carbon emissions while considering both the health and comfort of the occupants. It concludes that the building regulations should be revised to deal with current and future climatic conditions and to achieve the critical conditions that allow for natural ventilation in Kuala Lumpur. © Copyright 2017 NCEUB.","Building regulations; Indoor air quality; Indoor comfort; Kuala Lumpur; Natural ventilation","Building codes; Carbon; Energy utilization; Housing; Sustainable development; Tall buildings; Ventilation codes; Building regulations; Climatic conditions; Design of buildings; High rise building; Mechanical equipment; Mechanical ventilation; Natural ventilation; Residential building; Ventilation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071559478

A vertical furnace with a cross section of 260 x 260 mm2 and 1200 mm long was used in this study. The fine particles of grape marc, 150-250 μm in size, are fed through a central jet, using CO2 as the carrier gas, and burned in a hot and vitiated co-flow. The furnace walls, as well as co-flow temperature and local oxygen concentrations, are controlled by a secondary swirling burner using non-premixed natural gas combustion. The co-flow stream temperature was fixed at 1320K with an excess O2 mole fraction of 6%. The jet exit velocity was varied from 5.75 ms-1 (~Rejet = 13,040) to 7.63 ms-1 (~Rejet = 17,300) to investigate the impact of turbulent jet velocity, as well as the particle residence time, on the burning characteristics of grape marc under MILD combustion conditions. Detailed measurements of in-furnace temperatures and in-furnace CO and NOx concentrations are presented and discussed, together with visual observations at the bottom, middle and top region of the furnace. It is found that, for both cases, a stable MILD combustion is established with a semi-uniform temperature profile. The measured NOx emission of the higher jet velocity case is found to be 38% higher than that of lower jet velocity case. While the CO emission for the higher jet velocity case is considerably, around 51%, lower than the lower jet velocity case. © 2018 Combustion Institute.

A study area along the main stem of the Kiskatinaw River of the Kiskatinaw River watershed, Northeast British Columbia, Canada, was used as a case study. Two different greenhouse gas (GHG) emission scenarios (i.e., A2: heterogeneous world with self-reliance and preservation of local identities, and B1: a more integrated and environmental-friendly world) of the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES) from the Fourth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) for 2013 were used as case scenarios. Before conducting uncertainty analysis, a sensitivity analysis was performed to find the most sensitive parameters to the model output (i.e., mean monthly groundwater contribution to stream flow). Then, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to conduct the uncertainty analysis. The uncertainty analysis results under both case scenarios revealed that the pattern of the cumulative relative frequency distribution of the mean monthly and annual groundwater contributions to stream flow varied monthly and annually, respectively, due to the uncertainties of the sensitive model parameters. In addition, the pattern of the cumulative relative frequency distribution of a particular month's groundwater contribution to the stream flow differed significantly between both scenarios. These results indicated the complexities and uncertainties in the GW-SW interaction system. Therefore, it is of necessity to use such uncertainty analysis results rather than the point estimates for better water resources management decision-making. © 2017 by the authors.","Groundwater-surface water interaction; Monte Carlo simulation; Parameter uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060809645

A field study for two consecutive years (2013 and 2014) was conducted to continuously measure CH4 and N2O emissions from rice paddies under various agricultural management schedules like water regimes (irrigated and rainfed), transplanting dates and nutritional amendments (synthetic fertilizer with N as ammonium sulphate, P and K according to recommended dose, and vermicompost). Rainfed situation incurred a drop in CH4 fluxes triggering substantial N2O emission. Ammonium sulphate application tended to reduce CH4 emissions, but significantly increased N2O emissions. Enhanced CH4 fluxes were measured during panicle initiation to flowering stage while, maximum N2O emissions were recorded during flowering to milking stage of rice crop. Significant interrelationship between the gases was evaluated. In addition, seasonal average of CH4 and N2O emissions was also correlated with rice production. In conclusion, GHG concentration may control to some extent optimizing rice productivity through implementing and improving crop- and location-specific management practices.","Agroclimatic region; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Rice field",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85014637632

Field studies have shown that the failure of acidized rock may cause damage and thereby negatively impact production. In this work, an integrated analysis workflow is presented to simulate acid placement in carbonate reservoirs and model stimulated rock behavior during the productive lifetime of the well. The workflow is utilized to design a unique approach to horizontal wellbore acidizing and optimize the strategy to maximize hydrocarbon recovery. The presented workflow is based on the interaction between the distributions of reactive fluid along a wellbore, a two scale continuum model to simulate porosity evolution during stimulation, and stimulated rock performance during production time. The model first simulates stimulation fluid movement in the wellbore and couples it with transient reservoir flow. The primary analysis provides the distribution of reactive fluid along the well. The rock dissolution at each section of reservoir is then analyzed by continuum two-scale model (pore-scale and Darcy scale). This analysis presents porosity evolution at different locations along the well and at different radial distance from the wellbore center. Then, the developed geomechanical engine simulates the weakened rock under the in-situ stresses and bottom-hole pressure and predicts any possible compressional or shear failure. The effect of rock failure is then considered on the production prediction. The workflow is best used to analyze and optimize acid stimulation for a horizontal well. The analysis results show that the induced wormholes are stable and open since reservoir depletion increases the effective mean stress. At the elevated mean effective stress, wormholes or pores start to collapse and the failure extended away from near wellbore region and neutralized the stimulation effects. Since in the acid treated zone the rock is softened, the stress concentration around the wellbore might extended more into the reservoir. Analyzing this phenomenon showed that at a certain level of lowered stress concentration extension, in other words at certain strength and volume of acid, the wormhole can be stable and open during expected production time. Furthermore, the coupled analysis also demonstrates that at specific environment, the wormholes penetrated further into the rock, longer than possible induced failure. The workflow can be used to determine how weak or strong the acid should be at specific environmental condition to have longer life for the induced wormholes and hence extra hydrocarbon recovery.

USDA110Twt possesses the nosZ gene, which encodes N2O reductase; 110ΔnosZ, a mutant variant, does not. Changes in the community structure after 30- and 60-d incubations were investigated by denaturing-gradient gel electrophoresis and an image analysis. USDA6T and 76T strains slightly increased in non-flooded soil regardless of which USDA110T strain was present. In flooded microcosms with the USDA110Twt strain, USDA110Twt became dominant, whereas in microcosms with the USDA110ΔnosZ, a similar change in the community structure occurred to that in non-flooded microcosms. These results suggest that possession of the nosZ gene confers a competitive advantage to B. diazoefficiens USDA110T in flooded soil.

From a practical point of view, current paper presents an applicable technique to characterize a naturally fractured reservoir utilizing Formation Micro Imager (FMI) and velocity deviation logs, cores and thin sections. The proposed methodology is presented with an application to field information acquired from a carbonate oil field, located in southwest of Iran. To accomplish this, the FMI raw data were processed and interpreted. Then velocity deviation logs and secondary porosity were also measured and compared. Image logs were interpreted in order to extract fractures and moreover statistical analysis has been done to recognize the fracture patterns. The results indicate that stylolites, pores, open and filled micro-fractures are present in the studied reservoir. Fractures are mainly seen as longitudinal and transversal types with high angles rather than to bedding surface. The main porosity system of the reservoir includes inter particle and fractures. According to the presence of oil staining in thin sections, it is revealed that fractures are suitable conduits for fluid flow in same carbonate fractured reservoir. Relationship between derived fracture set with in-situ stresses were examined and distinguished that the maximum horizontal stress (SHmax) orientation is consistent with the focal mechanism solutions in Iran from the World Stress Map database. © 2017 E.

The heat supply curve is defined through ten scenarios, which represent incremental shares of excess heat as the constraints of the said legal instruments are lifted. The heat demand curve follows the end-users’ response to price changes. The most ambitious scenario doubles the amount of excess heat supplied and reduces the heat carbon footprint by 90% compared to current level, for an end-user price increase of 41%. The price increase results from a higher supply of excess heat at a higher price and an unchanged purchase cost from the coal-fired CHP plant despite a lower supply.

Design/methodology/approach: Researchers queried 40 FMs about their experience working in Qatar, using interviews and workshops. Findings: Comments gathered followed general patterns. Participants expressed appreciation for their work, but also concern about cultural challenges they faced managing facilities in the region. In general, it was agreed that the low cost of water and energy in Qatar is one of the largest obstacles to conserving resources; however, current consumption is not sustainable. Research limitations/implications: The sensitive nature of this study made strict demands on the research team to maintain participant anonymity during data collection and reporting. This sensitivity also limited the sample size; a larger sample size for future research would support greater generalizability. Social implications: Qatar is taking steps to reduce its per capita carbon footprint and energy use, which is among the highest in the world. However, there appears to be a disconnect between Qatar’s expressed intentions and its actions with respect to facility management. To ensure that Qatar manages resources more efficiently, participants recommended that reduced energy use standards be adopted and legally mandated. This action would address many of the challenges, incentivize increased qualifications and training of FM professionals working in Qatar and encourage improvement of the long-term performance of buildings which are energy drains and heavy contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. Originality/value: Prior to this study, little has been published about current practices of facility management in Doha, Qatar, and the challenges and opportunities that FMs face in this region. © 2017, © Emerald Publishing Limited.","Climate change; Doha; Facilities management; Qatar; Sustainable buildings; Sustainable development; Sustainable policies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85016978722

This is important, first of all, for tracking changes and establishing reasons in local biodiversity changes. In the paper, we consider recent variations of the key climatic characteristics (air surface temperature and precipitation amount) in three elevation zones of the SNP.

The benzene monitor concentrations are made available to the public. If a facility's annual average benzene concentration exceeds the designated action level, the facility must locate the source(s) of benzene inside the refinery and determine how to reduce the emissions. This study uses the relationship between multiple monitor's air concentrations and simultaneous wind direction data to locate within a multiple acreage refinery the most significant source of fenceline benzene concentrations. Each monitor's recorded benzene air concentrations were analyzed by regression with simultaneous measured wind directions using a non-parametric method. A refinery in Texas with three fenceline adjacent benzene monitors served to demonstrate the method usefulness. Measured wind directions were recorded at a nearby airport. The method shows all three monitors' lowest benzene concentrations corresponded to wind directions where the back trajectory or path of air sampled came from surrounding residential areas. All three monitors' highest benzene concentrations corresponded to wind directions where the back trajectory or path of air sampled came from the refinery. A back trajectory was drawn from each monitor along the path of the wind direction representing the monitor's highest benzene impact. The three monitor's back trajectories intersected within an area of the refinery inferring the most significant benzene source location and illustrating the value of the method. The source location prediction was sensitive to changes in the monitor concentration averaging time but not the wind speed threshold. The urban area of Houston, Texas with three benzene monitors was used to review the method usefulness for longer distance projects and for an urban setting. Measured wind directions were recorded at the nearby Houston airport. All three monitors' highest benzene concentrations corresponded to wind directions where the back trajectory or path of air sampled came from Deer Park, Texas. A company in Deer Park, Texas settled alleged Clean Air Act violations in 2013. The success of the method both for a refinery and in an urban area and for extremely nearfield (2000-feet) and farther downwind distances (10-km) infers robust applicability of the method.","Benzene; Refinery; Source attribution",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039150278

Management and sustainable management of forest and agricultural ecosystems can have a positive influence on maintaining optimal stock of carbon sequestered. A case study achieved in the Humor catchment reveals that changing the land’s utility means important modifications in the quantity of the carbon organic in ecosystems. The transition from forest biomass to herbaceous biomass or crops it means a considerable reduction of the organic carbon. Other important changes are occurring in soil trough the transformation of forest humus in grassland humus and cropland. The most common changes of intended land use were: from the forest to grassland, from the forest to arable, from the forest to urban use, from the grassland to arable, from the grassland to urban use, and less, from the grassland to forest or from the arable to grassland. In case of deforestation or fire, the soil organic carbon (SOC) is reduced by an amount equivalent to biomass missing. As a result of the insect attack, the living biomass turns into deadwood and the total organic carbon (TOC) will persist for a while even after decomposition of the wood, which will be incorporated into the forest soil. Litter and soil organic carbon last longer after fire or deforestation, but in time it is eroded either reshuffled or mineralized. The calculation of the stock of organic carbon sequestered it was achieved by quantitative estimation methods in the biomass, soil, deadwood and litter, depending on the type of land use. In the case of forest ecosystems, carbon stock it depends on the species composition of the forest, the trees age and the density of the trees. The study was conducted to demonstrate by calculations that changes in the land use pattern lead to increases and decreases in the carbon stock segregated in forest ecosystems. The used methodology correlates Corine Land Cover data with the carbon stock estimations from different land use categories, highlighting changes from one historical period to another. © 2017, Gh.

Public sector institutions in Canada are committed to becoming carbon neutral to attain a leadership position in climate change mitigation-related initiatives. Recent statistics reveal that buildings account for the majority of the corporate carbon footprint of public sector institutions. Hence, there is an increasing interest towards developing net zero energy and net zero emission buildings to comply with climate action targets. With limited financial resources, public sector institutions must optimize investments into building energy retrofits by considering lifecycle cost (LCC), overall energy performance, and related greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. The aim of this paper is to develop an investment planning approach for net zero emission buildings (NZEB). First, an investment planning approach for NZEB is proposed. A typical recreational centre building in British Columbia, Canada, was used as the archetype to demonstrate the concept. Second, innovative and proven building energy retrofits were analysed using energy simulation software to assess the impact on energy consumption reduction, GHG emissions, and LCC. Third, impacts of geographical location, tariff regimes, and grid emission factors on energy retrofits were studied by locating the same building in other provinces of Canada. This study revealed that net zero energy investment has a strong correlation to the grid emission factor. The proposed approach in this paper will assist building managers and owners in retrofitting and budget planning. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Climate change; Decision-making; Energy retrofits; Investment planning; Net zero emission buildings","Air pollution; Budget control; Buildings; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Computer software; Decision making; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Planning; Retrofitting; Zero energy buildings; British Columbia , Canada; Climate change mitigation; Energy retrofit; Financial resources; Geographical locations; Investment planning; Strong correlation; Zero emission buildings; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018252618

The Delta-Flux network will coordinate the activities of 17 eddy covariance towers. The network addresses the need for scaled C and water cycle observations. The network aims to promote sustainable, climate-smart land management. Delta-Flux is open to collaborators from strategic sites and relevant disciplines. Networks of remotely monitored research sites are increasingly the tool used to study regional agricultural impacts on carbon and water fluxes. However, key national networks such as the National Ecological Observatory Network and AmeriFlux lack contributions from the Lower Mississippi River Basin (LMRB), a highly productive agricultural area with opportunities for soil carbon sequestration through conservation practices. The authors describe the rationale to create the new Delta-Flux network, which will coordinate efforts to quantify carbon and water budgets at seventeen eddy covariance flux tower sites in the LMRB. The network structure will facilitate climate-smart management strategies based on production-scale and continuous measurements of carbon and water fluxes from the landscape to the atmosphere under different soil and water management conditions. The seventeen instrumented field sites are expected to monitor fluxes within the most characteristic landscapes of the target area: row-crop fields, pasture, grasslands, forests, and marshes. The network participants are committed to open collaboration and efficient regionalization of site-level findings to support sustainable agricultural and forestry management and conservation of natural resources.

Material and methods: We review the main effects of forest management by comparing the effects of silvicultural systems (even-aged vs. uneven-aged stands, coppice systems, agroforestry systems), silvicultural options (thinning, rotation period, species composition), afforestation, harvesting, fire impact or effects of shrub layer on carbon sequestration in the Mediterranean area. Main results: We illustrate as forest management can clearly improve forest carbon sequestration amounts. We conclude that forest management is an effective way to maintain and enhance high carbon sequestration rates in order to cope with climate change and provision of ecosystem services. We also think that although much effort has been put into this topic research, there are still certain gaps that must be dealt with to increase our scientific knowledge and in turn transfer this knowledge to forest practitioners in order to achieve sustainable management aimed at mitigating climate change. Research highlights: It is important to underline the importance of forests in the carbon cycle as this role can be enhanced by forest managers through sustainable forest management. The effects of different management options or disturbances can be critical as regards mitigating climate change. Understanding the effects of forest management is even more important in the Mediterranean area, given that the current high climatic variability together with historical human exploitation and disturbance events make this area more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. © 2017 INIA.","Carbon sequestration potential; Climate change mitigation; Forest mitigation strategies; Forest sink; Global carbon cycle; Mediterranean forests",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85032011741

Overall, three sites were investigated to determine the nature and the origin of the gases bubbling at the seafloor and forming acoustic plumes into the water column, as this was the question raised from the first geologic study of the area. This has guided our study and accordingly corresponds to the main purpose of the present article. Thus, the molecular and isotopic (δDand δ13C) analyses revealed that the gas seeps were primarily composed of methane. Both methane and ethane are of microbial origin, and the former has been generated by microbial reduction of carbon dioxide. Heavier hydrocarbons accounted for less than 0.06% mol of the total amount. Despite the microbial origin of methane, the samples exhibit subtle differences with respect to the δ13CCH4 values, which varied between −72.7 and −66.1‰. It has been suggested that such a discrepancy was predominantly governed by the occurrence of anaerobic methane oxidation. The PEGAZ sampler also enabled us to estimate the local gas fluxes from the sampled streams. The resulting values are extremely heterogeneous between seeps, ranging from 35 to 368mLn⋅min−1. Assuming a steady discharge, the mean calculated methane emission for the nine seeps is of 38 kmol⋅yr−1. Considering the extent of the seep area, this very local estimate suggests that the Aquitaine Shelf is a very appropriate place to study methane discharge and its fate on continental shelves. © 2017 Livio Ruffine et al.",,"continental shelf; gas seepage; hydrocarbon reservoir; in situ measurement; methane; pressure field; seafloor; Aquitaine; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Biscay; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85027343576

Gasoline Particle Filters (GPF) represent a potential way to reduce particle number emissions from DISI engines and are particularly effective considering the tough performance requirements during cold start and over RDE operation. Even though some learning from the development and application of particulate filters to diesel engines can be transferred to gasoline engines, the particle composition, mass to number ratio as well as the exhaust gas temperature and composition from gasoline engines are significantly different to diesel engines. Therefore, there is the need to study the application of particulate filters to gasoline engines in more depth. Of particular concern, is the understanding of the ash accumulation mechanism within the GPF and its negative impact on the backpressure over lifetime. This paper presents the results from a fundamental study of an uncoated ceramic GPF in the exhaust after-treatment system of a 1.6 litre turbo DISI engine. Soot and ash accumulation data are reported comparing two aggressive driving cycles (Artemis Urban vs. Artemis Motorway). Each cycle was operated for 20k km on a dynamic engine bench. PN emissions were then measured over WLTC and NEDC test cycles after 20k km. The results are discussed with respect to the differences from each cycle for the ash formation and backpressure increase; it also considers the possibility of extrapolating the results to a more balanced driving pattern over 160k km. Results from the engine bench investigation are compared to a vehicle durability run, using the same engine and type of GPF in the under-floor (UF) location. Results show PN filtration efficiency of the GPF, above 70% in fresh condition and above 90% with increasing mileage. Further, low soot accumulation and low ash amounts were detected after the durability run was completed. Ash is mainly related to the oil consumption of the engine and small differences were observed between the two Artemis cycles. In particular the Artemis Urban cycle shows higher ash amount over 20k km (1.26 g/l) compared to the Artemis Motorway (0.4 g/l). These ash values from the engine bench correlate well with the findings of the vehicle durability run. Post mortem analysis (PMA) of the GPF after both engine bench and vehicle durability tests are also reported.

Under an optimal RSI dosage of 20 g/L, increasing O2 levels were added stepwise in seven stages in a semi-continuous experiment. Results showed the average methane yield was 306 mL/g COD (chemical oxygen demand), and the hydrogen sulphide (H2S) concentration was 1933 ppmv with RSI addition. O2 addition induced the microbial oxidation of sulphide by stimulating sulfur-oxidizing bacteria and chemical corrosion of iron, which promoted the generation of FeS and Fe2S3. In the 6th phase of the semi-continuous test, deep desulfurization was achieved without negatively impacting system performance. Average methane yield was 301.1 mL/g COD, and H2S concentration was 75 ppmv. Sulfur mass balance was described, with 84.0%, 11.90% and 0.21% of sulfur present in solid, liquid and gaseous phases, respectively. The Polymerase Chain Reaction-Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis (PCR-DGGE) analysis revealed that RSI addition could enrich the diversity of hydrogenotrophic methanogens and iron-reducing bacteria to benefit methanogenesis and organic mineralization, and impoverish the methanotroph (Methylocella silvestris) to reduce the consumption of methane. Micro-oxygen supplementation could enhance the diversity of iron-oxidizing bacteria arising from the improvement of Fe(II) release rate and enrich the sulphur-oxidising bacteria to achieved desulfurization. These results demonstrated that RSI addition in combination with micro-oxygenation represents a promising method for simultaneously controlling biogas H2S concentration and improving digestion performance. © 2017 by the author.","Anaerobic digestion; Average methane yield; Chemical corrosion; Desulfurization efficiency; Micro-oxygen; Sulfur balance; Sulfur-oxidizing bacteria","Bacteria; Bioactivity; Chemical oxygen demand; Corrosion; Desulfurization; Electrophoresis; Iron compounds; Iron scrap; Methane; Polymerase chain reaction; Sludge digestion; Sludge disposal; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Chemical corrosion; Desulfurization efficiency; Methane Yield; Micro-oxygen; Sulfur balance; Sulfur oxidizing bacteria; Anaerobic digestion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85035244194

The capture part of the CO2-DISSOLVED system, designed and patented by Pi-Innovation [1] basically consists in injecting the fumes into a special storage well where CO2 would dissolve into the water within the well prior to its injection in a deep saline aquifer. This capture strategy makes mandatory to use a water/brine movement. Therefore, the CO2-DISSOLVED concept consists in coupling this CO2-brine dissolution technology to a geothermal loop with a hot brine production well for heat extraction and an injection well for re-injecting the cooled brine saturated with CO2 [2]. This loop provides storage and heat for the processes of the emitting plant. Due to the limited amount of CO2 that can be totally dissolved in the geothermal loop (about 10 to 15 ton/h, typically), the CO2-DISSOLVED concept is well suited for small-size emitters. For a sugar beet refinery [3], the BECCS approach provides excellent environmental results with negative emission due to the production of the bioethanol. However, on the economic standpoint, the performance of the project was poor due to the small volume of emission stored that could not offset the CAPEX. Applying the CO2-DISSOLVED approach to the same plant, i.e. coupling CO2 capture with a geothermal loop, enables significant reductions both on the emissions, between 25 to 60%, and on the energy, between 5 to 30% depending on the assumptions compare to the no CCS case (i.e. currently operating conditions). As compared to the BECCS reference case (Laude et al., 2011), the CO2-DISSOLVED approach can achieve an emission reduction between 15 to 50% while the corresponding non-renewable energy consumption can be reduced by 5 to 30%. The CO2 emission reduction is bigger than the non-renewable energy consumption reduction because the first stages of compression for the CO2-DISSOLVED approach require significant compression energy. On the economic standpoint, to reach an emission reduction from 15% to 50% higher, the BECCS approach costs between 100% and 350% more than the CO2-DISSOLVED approach. The cost per ton of CO2 saved (stored + not emitted by the combustion due the use of geothermal energy) for the range of performance of the project is between 39 and 72 €2015/ton saved over a 30 year lifetime (at 6% WACC). This is still higher than the current CO2 price level in Europe. However, the project reduced natural gas consumption via the geothermal loop which significantly improves the economics of the project. The probabilistic distribution of the Net Present Value of this project ranges between - 5 MM€2015 and +20 MM€2015 with an average value of 8 MM€2015. This wide range is linked to the wide range of CO2 prices considered in the model (5 to 50 €/ton of CO2). It shows that the project can be reasonably profitable at 6% discount rate (WACC) for the average scenario. Considering the best efficiency scenario, the project can be profitable in the current market conditions. It is also interesting to mention that from 12.5 €/ton onward, the CO2-DISSOLVED project is worth doing as compared to a pure geothermal project. This shows that this approach should be seriously envisaged for future geothermal projects provided local conditions make the project technically feasible (CO2 sources and storage integrity). Even if this study is at a conceptual stage, the CO2-DISSOLVED approach seems really worth investigating for small CO2 sources. It can contribute to reduce CO2 emission at significantly lower cost than CCS. It is noteworthy to mention that very specific conditions have to be fulfilled to be able to develop a CO2-DISSOLVED project, such as CO2 availability, and subsurface favorable context (geothermal and storage). However, a previous study [4] demonstrated the existence of an actual potential of application of this technology in France, Germany, and the U.S.A. © 2017 The Authors.","BECCS; Carbon Capture and Storage; CO2-DISSOLVED project; Economic evaluation; Geothermal energy","Aquifers; Carbon; Carbon capture; Cost reduction; Costs; Dissolution; Economic analysis; Emission control; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Geothermal energy; Geothermal prospecting; Greenhouse gases; Injection (oil wells); Natural gas; Probability distributions; Profitability; Saline water; Sugar beets; Water injection; BECCS; CO2 emission reduction; CO2-DISSOLVED project; Economic evaluations; Economic standpoints; Natural gas consumption; Non-renewable energy; Probabilistic distribution; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029624273

Overall, these cost evaluations demonstrate that membrane-based post-combustion CO2 capture can significantly benefit from lower CCRs (up to 55% reduction in CO2 avoidance cost for a flue gas containing 35% CO2). Considering lower CCRs could therefore enable early deployment of CCS despite low carbon emission cost, however the evaluations show that the optimal CCR and corresponding cost reduction potential shall be assessed considering the whole chain characteristics (CO2 content in the flue gas, impurities, membrane module properties, CO2 transport system, etc.). © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS); CO2 capture ratio; Membrane separation; Post-combustion capture; Techno-economic optimisation","Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Cost reduction; Flue gases; Flues; Membranes; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); CO2 capture; Membrane separation; Post-combustion captures; Techno-economics; Carbon capture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021405320

If nuclear power plants retire, CO2 emissions in many U.S. states could increase, even while the states comply with EPA legislation aimed at mitigating emissions of greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. In this paper, we perform a Monte Carlo-based analysis to determine the breakeven price of electricity these plants must secure in order to avoid financial loses between 2015 and 2040, and find median breakeven electricity prices to range between $35 and $73 per MWh. Based on our estimates of future electricity prices under a low natural gas price scenario from the Energy Information Administration, our analysis suggests that U.S. nuclear plants would require between $8 and $44 per MWh (median results) on top of electric sales revenue in order to breakeven. Assuming natural gas plants would replace retired nuclear power plants, we estimate an equivalent cost of avoided CO2 emissions to be $18-$30 per metric ton of avoided CO2 (median results) for multi-reactor nuclear plants, and $47-$97 per metric ton of avoided CO2 (median results) for single-reactor plants. Preserving the existing nuclear power plant fleet, especially multi-reactor plants, is thus a cost effective carbon-avoidance strategy compared to the social cost of carbon. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Abatement; Carbon; Economics; Nuclear; Power; Retirement","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Cost estimating; Costs; Dust abatement; Economics; Fossil fuel power plants; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Nuclear energy; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Carbon-free electricity; Climate mitigations; Electricity prices; Energy Information Administration; Nuclear; Power; Retirement; Social cost of carbon; Cost benefit analysis; abatement cost; carbon emission; climate change; electricity; emission control; energy market; environmental economics; environmental legislation; Monte Carlo analysis; natural gas; nuclear power plant; pollution tax; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85018933650

This rapidly emerging technology will affect the transport system in its entirety including changes in energy consumption; increased safety, climate change impacts, efficiency of transport operations and the platooning of trucks carrying freight. Primary questions remain. What are reasonable expectations of the impact of autonomous and connected vehicles on travel demand, energy consumption, and emissions? Can vehicle to vehicle communication have a significant impact on congestion and vehicle movements that will result in smoother traffic flow and accompanying reductions in energy and emissions? What policies and regulations guiding the operation of autonomous and connected vehicles will be enacted and to what extent will autonomous vehicles penetrate the market over what time period? This article attempts to identify and quantify the impact of autonomous vehicles on energy through development of scenarios that gauge the potential range and contribution of this emerging technology. The scenarios reflect an assessment of the state of practice and current research conducted in both the public and the private sector. Three scenarios are examined in details including energy impacts based on partial or full automation and personal versus a shared vehicle future for autonomous vehicles.

Considering the present post-glacial land uplift rates of Estonian coastal areas and the global ocean level rise projections, the long-existing trend of relative sea-level lowering may very probably be replaced by a relative sea-level rising trend during the twenty-first century. By the end of the twenty-first century we project the relative sea level to be c. 20 to 40 cm or c. 40 to 60 cm higher in the case of the International Panel for Climate Change Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) 4.5 or RCP 8.5 scenario, respectively. The sea-level rise together with the increased storm frequency and decreased winter ice cover period will very probably increase the extent of floods during the twenty-first century. A significant coastal flooding risk affects four cities, Pärnu, Kuressaare, Haapsalu and Tallinn and eight smaller towns. The largest coastal flooding in Estonia is recorded in Pärnu, with the highest sea level 275 cm in 2005. Calculations show that due to the impact of predicted climate change and in the case of certain weather conditions, coastal floods in Pärnu may affect areas up to 400 cm above the present sea level by the end of the twenty-first century. The scenarious of future flood limits are needed for sustainable planning of the coastal zone and for development of rescue strategies.There are already several land use and urban planning instruments and laws for climate adaptation, such as environmental impact assessment, risk assessment and restriction zones for construction in certain buffer and flood areas. Flooding risk measures consist of risk mapping and a national emergency plan. However, further integration of climate issues into existing laws, strategies and land use plans is essential to have a targeted approach in reducing the vulnerability of populated areas and strengthening the adaptive capacity of the urban system against climate change. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.","Climate adaption; Coastal fooding; Estonia; Land uplift; Sea-level change",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065403803

The emissions from the manufacturing process can cause severe health problems like chronic asthma and even death. Automakers and policymakers need to investigate the lifecycle emissions of EVs in different regions and then governments should decide if it is safe to establish EV production facilities in their country or whether it is more appropriate to import finished products. The objective of this study is to evaluate the air pollutant emissions produced by EVs and gasoline vehicles (GVs) during their life cycles under two technology scenarios. Life cycle analysis (LCA) was applied to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) and non-GHG emissions. We assessed air pollution from vehicles in Japan, China, and the United Kingdom (UK). Results indicate that EVs do not necessarily decrease pollutant emissions.

This methodology is based on Statistical Process Control (SPC) and it is encapsulated in a Leakage Location System (LLS) that automatically processes the night-time data recorded, with a one minute frequency, by the DMA's pressure loggers. The LLS was field tested and verified on a large number of real-life DMAs with both real and engineered leak/burst events (i.e., simulated by opening fire hydrants). The selected DMAs have varying sizes and different characteristics (e.g., industrial/urban/rural, pressure-managed/gravity-fed, etc.). These DMAs were monitored for a period of approximately 4 months and 132 engineered events simulating leaks/bursts ranging between 1% and 40% of the average DMAs' inflow were carried out. The results obtained illustrate that the LLS enables obtaining substantially reduced operational costs by significantly reducing the leaks/bursts search area and reducing the number of unnecessary leak/burst repairs. The results obtained also illustrate that the LLS has the potential to enable water companies to: (a) improve customer service through more proactive and informed communications and reduction of the number/duration of supply interruptions and poor pressure situations, (b) realise a wide range of sustainability and environmental type benefits by saving large amounts of water, reducing energy requirements for pumping, consumption of chemicals for water treatment and hence the carbon footprint and (c) reduce the social costs associated with the disruption of traffic and business, the reduced fire-fighting capabilities and the potential of pollutant ingress through cracks. © 2016 The Authors.

These historical approaches have left large amounts of presence-only occurrences of several endemic species of the Andean region. Since sampling season in Patagonia is reduced to a minimum because of its large extension and climate conditions that govern the region, it is essential to focus on locations where subjects of study are present. Knowledge of patterns of fungal distributions can help lead future forest management investments as well as to guide efforts to delimit fungal hot-spots areas of conservation. The aim of the present work was to assess the potential distribution of a selection of 9 saprophytic and 9 ectomycorrhyzic gilled fungi based on their abundance, seasonality, occurrences in bibliography and detectability. Eighty localities were georreferenced for 260 occurrences of the species modelled. The ectomycorrhyzic Entoloma patagonicum presents the most restricted distribution among all species studied while Psathyrella falklandica, saprophytic, has the most widespread distribution. Despite having different nutritional requirements, all species studied exhibit a very similar dependence with mean precipitation of the driest month and similar potential distributions.

From the viewpoint of aquatic community organization, we must not only answer this question but must also evaluate the importance of this source of periphyton to the seston. We will here discuss these topics from a metacommunity perspective, on which we base our two hypotheses. The first hypothesis is that periphytic assemblages are charophyte species-specific and hence that their metacommunity structuration also corresponds to niche-based paradigms (species sorting or mass-effect views). In this sense, patch (charophyte host)-dependent processes could explain the distribution of periphytic microalgae and cyanobacteria. It is known that dispersal is important because it allows compositional changes to track changes in local environmental conditions. Thus, analysing the importance of dispersal to periphytic populations allows us to discriminate between the two niche-based paradigms. From this perspective, our second hypothesis is that the distribution of periphytic assemblages is also dependent on both the waterbody morphometry and the meadow location. Distribution in the meadows from shallower macrophyte-dominated waterbodies follows the mass-effect paradigm assumptions. When assemblages are in isolated meadows in deeper aquatic ecosystems, their distribution corresponds better with the species-sorting paradigm. To test these two hypotheses, we analysed periphyton assemblages growing in several charophyte meadows in stagnant Spanish waterbodies. The selected meadows differ in terms of charophyte species and the environmental conditions of their locations. Our results confirm our first hypothesis: Characeans exert an influence on periphyton composition and diversity. Thus, a niche-based process occurs in which meadows are patches, and the main mechanisms operating, linked to the phylogeny of characeans, are allelopathy, competition and host substrate-attachment processes, all of which are still poorly known in characeans. Furthermore, the host-periphyton relationship with seston seems to be dependent on both the waterbody morphometry and the meadow location. Therefore, our second hypothesis was also supported; while shallower sites shared more periphytic and planktonic species, suggesting contributions of mass-effect and patch dispersion processes, the more isolated meadows shared very few periphyton species with water column assemblages, thus supporting the species-sorting paradigm. Therefore, periphytic assemblages growing on charophytes promote the diversity of pelagial habitats and might enhance both channels (benthic and planktic) of carbon uptake and flux throughout the food web. However, and despite their demonstrated importance in all freshwater environments, our knowledge regarding the structure and dynamics of the charophyte-periphyton relationship is still poor, and we make a plea here to increase it. © 2017 E.

Furthermore, alternative configurations may improve systems resilience and democratization of service provision. How-ever, unlike current centralised systems, which are well understood from the technical and social perspectives, there is a lack of knowledge on the socio-technical interplay across multiple intermediate scales of alternative infrastructures, defined as all the possible configurations in between off-grid and centralised infrastructure. There are various concepts in the literature describing decentralised, distributed and integrated systems using different primary energy resources and generating various energy carriers -for electricity, heating, and cool-ing. However, the information on alternative models is limited to the technical requirements leaving a gap in knowledge on the societal requirements. Alternative infrastructure models potentially reduce GHGE but they may require unique forms of social organisation structures to support their adoption and increase the pace towards decarbonisation. To obtain in-depth understanding of the socio-technical interplay of alternative in-frastructures across scales, this paper draws on complexity theory, the concept of modularity and transitions modelling literature. This aid in the definition of the proposed conceptual framework and the Service Provision Modules (SPM). This conceptual framework serves as the basis for spatially specific modelling and simula-tion. The SPM may use different types of networks and can represent any type of conventional or alternative infrastructure configuration. The conceptual framework then uses the modules to construct the socio-technical layouts for the baseline and possible future configurations in a given area. The paper briefly outlines various concepts in the literature which technically define alternative energy systems, then presents a description of the conceptual framework and the definition of an SPM.

The projected changes in these circulation types are investigated for the 21st century using the SRES A1B scenario. The multi-model approach relies on the climate models from the ENSEMBLES project and circulation type classifications provided by the COST Action 733. For the latter, the two circulation type classifications GWT (Grosswetter-types) and CAP (Cluster Analysis of Principal components) are selected. GWT is applied to sea level pressure and geopotential height at 500 hPa whereas CAP is applied to sea level pressure. Overall, the ensemble of climate models captures the frequency of individual circulation types well, as shown by the comparison of circulation types from climate models and re-analysis data between 1980 and 2009. Discrepancies occur during winter (DJF) when westerlies are overestimated both at the sea level and at the 500 hPa geopotential height level. The model spread is largest during summer. The frequency of circulation types is simulated best during spring and autumn irrespective of the applied circulation type classification. The analysis of circulation types in the climate projections indicates that in winter easterlies are expected to decrease mostly at the benefit of westerlies until the end of the 21st century. In summer projected changes depend on the height level considered. At sea level westerlies are projected to decrease while easterlies increase markedly in their frequency. This change is not occurring on the 500 hPa geopotential height level. © 2016 The authors.","Alpine climate; Circulation type classification; Climate change; COST 733; Synoptic climatology","alpine environment; atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate modeling; cluster analysis; ensemble forecasting; regional climate; synoptic meteorology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85013379959

These options include small handheld units for spot measurements, data logging type monitors and realtime monitoring systems (e.g. fiber optic). Selecting the most appropriate climatic monitoring system depends mainly on the purpose of climatic monitoring, the magnitude of the mines’ heat load, monitoring locations and cost. However, there are several occurrences that cannot be captured when simple spot units are being used for climatic monitoring purposes. This includes the “thermal damping effect”, time-dependent dynamic heat exchanges between the ventilating air and surrounding environments, as well as unknown sharp temperature increases during production cycles. These elements are particularly important to predict the underground climatic conditions in future underground mines. Even if these phenomena are identified and quantified based on in-situ measurements, the key question still remains: How can we take them into account at the modeling phase through the use of standard mine ventilation and climatic simulation programs such as Climsim™, Ventsim™, Vuma™ and MULTIFLUX™? This paper aims to discuss the importance of continuous climatic monitoring in underground mines based on observations of the above-mentioned phenomena and highlight whether these cases have noticeable impact on the overall climatic conditions in underground mines. Discussions will be based on over six months of climatic data, which was collected at an underground mine in the State of Nevada, USA. Multi-channel climatic monitoring units were installed along vertical and horizontal airways from surface to the lowest production level of this mine. The monitoring units were installed in key locations to measure critical ventilation and climatic parameters needed for modeling work. Comparisons were performed between the ventilation and climatic data collected underground and parameters generated by ventilation and thermal models through the use of simulation techniques. Finally, the importance of developing a time-dependent dynamic ventilation-thermal-humidity (VTH) model was analyzed and discussed. This dynamic VTH model will be used to assess various cooling strategies and identify the most effective cooling and refrigeration methods, which can be economically employed in deep and hot mines. © SRAC - Societatea Romana Pentru Asigurarea Calitatii.

Nutrient applications for optimum production, specifically nitrogen (N), which can be organic or inorganic sources, are carefully managed in rice production. However, how nutrient-source effects on CH4 emissions from rice production may interact with other known factors affecting CH4 emissions, such as previous crop/crop rotation and soil texture, are poorly understood, particularly in the midsouthern United States where rice production is concentrated. The objective of this study was to evaluate CH4 fluxes and season-long emissions as affected by fertilizer-N source (i.e., ammoniumsulfate [AS], pelletized poultry litter [PPL] + urea, and urea only) and previous crop in rotation (i.e., soybean [Glycinemax L.] or rice) from rice production on a clayey Epiaquert and a silt-loamAlbaqualf in the Lower Mississippi River Delta region of eastern Arkansas. Methane fluxes,measured using 30-cm-diameter, enclosed-headspace chambers, peaked near heading for all treatments, with PPL + urea resulting in greater (P &lt; 0.05) peak fluxes than for the other fertilizer-N sources from both soil textures. Methane fluxes were consistently numerically lower fromthe clay soil throughout the growing season than fromthe silt-loam soil. Methane emissions from AS were, on average, 21% lower (P &lt; 0.05) than from PPL + urea or urea only, which did not differ, from the silt-loam soil. Methane emissions were 60%lower (P &lt; 0.05) when soybean was the previous crop compared with rice on the clay soil, but were unaffected (P&gt; 0.05) by previous crop on the silt-loam soil. Results clearly indicate that the choice of fertilizer-N source for certain soil textures, specifically AS application to a silt-loam soil, has the potential to mitigate CH4 emissions and reduce the large, negatively perceived, C footprint associated with rice production. © Copyright 2017 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Landfills are designed to manage waste, prevent contamination between the waste and natural environment, and provide a cost-effective disposal option, however they produce various toxic gases when bacteria break down the organic waste. Activated carbon is a well-developed sorbent material that has been effectively applied for the adsorption of odorous compounds in many industries. The material is characterized by high surface area, large complex pore volume, and high reactivity. For landfill applications, AC is a capable sorbent to address malodorous H2S but also promote oxidation of H2S to elemental sulfur, which also contributes to elimination of the odor. Removal effectiveness can be further enhanced by developing the porosity and catalytic activity of AC. Iron oxide sorbents have been applied for H2S removal from syngas applications and have shown good removal rates with low cost. H2S reacts with iron oxide in the presence of humidity to form sulfur iron species at ambient temperatures. Combining AC and iron oxides should yield a high-capacity sorbent with strong H2S removal capabilities that comes from a synergy of the two materials when applied for odor control at landfills. The high capacity will be required because other odor-causing pollutants may be present which require removal and will thus occupy adsorption sites. The goals of this research are to create a geotextile mat containing iron-impregnated activated carbon (FeAC) to ultimately remove H2S.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039166726

It consists in bringing a significant amount of residual thermal energy (waste heat) from a power plant to a city by means of heating the potable water supplied to this city. For this purpose (i) a great amount of the city water has to be supplied through a single aqueduct, (ii) the aqueduct has to pass near the power station, and (iii) the water supplied to the city has to be colder than the cooling circuit water in the power plant. The hot water generated in the power plant cooling circuit (which is usually dissipated in the cooling tower) is conducted through a pipe to a place near the aqueduct and, by means of a heat exchanger, part of the cooling water heat is then transferred to the colder potable water supplied to the city. This has the great advantage of using the existing city water network itself to transport the heat to the houses. Based on data from a coal power plant located in Asturias (Northern Spain), two city water heating systems of different sizes are described and analysed. The following advantages were found: (i) energy saving and cost reduction for inhabitants, (ii) reduction in global warming and (iii) CO2emissions reduction. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd","CO2emissions; Coal power plant; District heating; Eco-efficiency; Global warming; Waste heat recovery","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Cooling; Cooling water; Cost reduction; District heating; Emission control; Energy conservation; Fossil fuel power plants; Global warming; Hydraulic structures; Metal recovery; Potable water; Waste heat; Waste heat utilization; Coal power plants; Coal-burning power plants; Cooling circuits; Different sizes; Eco-efficiency; Emissions reduction; Water heating systems; Water networks; Heating; aqueduct; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; coal-fired power plant; cooling water; cost analysis; drinking water; energy efficiency; environmental economics; environmental impact; global warming; heating; thermal power; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84950974206

They are superior to traditional elastomers primarily in their ease of fabrication. Like traditional elastomers they offer benefits including reduction in noise emissions and improved wear resistance in metal components that are in contact with such parts in the railcar suspension system. However, viscoelastic materials, such as the railroad bearing thermoplastic elastomer suspension element (or elastomeric pad), are known to develop self-heating (hysteresis) under cyclic loading, which can lead to undesirable consequences. Quantifying the hysteresis heating of the pad during operation is therefore essential to predict its dynamic response and structural integrity, as well as, to predict and understand the heat transfer paths from bearings into the truck assembly and other contacting components. This study investigates the internal heat generation in the suspension pad and its impact on the complete bearing assembly dynamics and thermal profile. Specifically, this paper presents an experimentally validated finite element thermal model of the elastomeric pad and its internal heat generation. The steady-state and transient-state temperature profiles produced by hysteresis heating of the elastomer pad are developed through a series of experiments and finite element analysis. The hysteresis heating is induced by the internal heat generation, which is a function of the loss modulus, strain, and frequency. Based on previous experimental studies, estimations of internally generated heat were obtained. The calculations show that the internal heat generation is impacted by temperature and frequency. At higher frequencies, the internally generated heat is significantly greater compared to lower frequencies, and at higher temperatures, the internally generated heat is significantly less compared to lower temperatures. However, during service operation, exposure of the suspension pad to higher loading frequencies above 10 Hz is less likely to occur. Therefore, internal heat generation values that have a significant impact on the suspension pad steady-state temperature are less likely to be reached. The commercial software package ALGOR 20.3TM is used to conduct the thermal finite element analysis. Different internal heating scenarios are simulated with the purpose of obtaining the bearing suspension element temperature distribution during normal and abnormal conditions. The results presented in this paper can be used in the future to acquire temperature distribution maps of complete bearing assemblies in service conditions and enable a refined model for the evolution of bearing temperature during operation. © Copyright 2017 ASME.",,"Ball bearings; Elastomers; Finite element method; Heat generation; Heat transfer; Heating; Hysteresis; Plastics; Railroad bearings; Railroads; Reinforced plastics; Suspensions (components); Temperature distribution; Viscoelasticity; Wear resistance; Bearing temperature; Commercial software; Internal heat generation; Loading frequencies; Steady state and transients; Steady-state temperature; Thermal finite element analysis; Visco-elastic material; Thermoplastic elastomers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85026848663

Accurate perceptions of climate variability and change can help farmers take effective measures to protect their livelihoods against threats from local environmental change; conversely, understanding how farmers perceive threats from climate change (or not) can help policy-makers anticipate the diversity of strategies and behaviors that will ultimately shape the vulnerability of agriculture in the coming decades. Nevertheless, perceptions of climatic variability and change are influenced by far more than direct experience with and observations of weather and climate; thus, farmers' perceptions may not always accurately reflect observed climatic trends. We analyzed Mexican maize farmers' perceptions of change in drought frequency as a proxy for their perceptions of climate variability and change. Through statistical analyses of survey data collected from 1092 maize-producing households in Sinaloa, Chiapas, and the state of Mexico, we identified factors associated with the perception of change in drought frequency. Results showed that indigenous identity and receipt of credits or loans were the variables that most strongly influenced, either positively or negatively, perceptions of change in drought frequency. These results suggest that climate adaptation policies will need to go beyond focusing on agronomic options to consider the social and institutional contexts of farmers' decision-making as important influences on their risk perception and adaptation strategies. © Inter-Research 2017.","Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Drought; Mexico; Perceptions","adaptive management; agrometeorology; agronomy; climate change; drought stress; maize; risk perception; vulnerability; Chiapas; Mexico [North America]; Sinaloa; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85021797936

In this paper, we assess the effects of GI on urban microclimate and air quality patterns in Porto’s urban area, in Northern Portugal. A set of numerical and physical simulations were carried out using the CFD model VADIS and the wind tunnel (WT) of the University of Aveiro, for the baseline and for a green scenario. The baseline simulations focus on the current morphological characteristics of the study area, while the green scenario comprises the replacement of built-up area by green areas. CFD simulations and WT measurements were performed using distinct inflow conditions for typical wind directions (North, West and Southeast) and speeds (1.6, 3 and 4.5 m.s-1, at 20 m high). The results from both numerical and physical simulations at 8 points within the domain, at a height corresponding to 1.5 m in full-scale, are in good agreement showing better correlations in case of lower inflow wind speeds – a minimum root mean square error of 0.4 m.s-1 for the green scenario and 0.5 m.s-1 for the baseline. The simulated air quality levels were compared with hourly averaged PM10 concentrations measured on the 24th September 2010 at the air quality station located within the study domain.

Acute and chronic toxicity tests, benthic fauna community analysis and metal bioavailability evaluations were applied to identify risks to the benthic community. Significant amphipod mortality was observed close to the major pollution source and lower copepod fertility was observed for all stations. Equilibrium-partitioning and biotic-ligand models to predict pore water metal toxicity, which were based on acid-volatile sulfide (AVS) and organic carbon fraction (fOC) normalization approaches, suggested that metals are not likely to be available in sediment pore water. However, Cd, Pb and Zn concentrations were mainly (&gt;50%) weakly bound to sediments, suggesting high potential bioavailability. Linking the chemical results with ecotoxicological responses, we observed that sediment-feeding organisms presented acute and chronic toxicities that were positively correlated to the metal concentrations in the sediments. Additionally, benthic fauna composition was dominated by tolerant species, revealing a trophic structure response to environmental contamination. These results reinforce the necessity of a multiple lines of evidence approach to establish sediment quality and to support environmental management decisions that are based on observed effects and potential extrapolation scenarios into the future. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Equilibrium-partitioning model; Macrobenthos; Metal bioavailability; Metal toxicity tests; Sepetiba Bay","Animals; Biochemistry; Contamination; Environmental management; Metals; Organic carbon; Risk assessment; Sedimentology; Sulfur compounds; Toxicity; Trace elements; Water; Equilibrium partitioning model; Macro benthos; Metal bioavailability; Metal toxicity; Sepetiba Bay; Sediments; acid volatile sulfide; cadmium; lead; metal; organic carbon; sulfide; unclassified drug; zinc; metal; sulfide; trace element; water pollutant; benthos; ecotoxicology; macrobenthos; modeling; mortality; sediment pollution; toxicity test; trace metal; acute toxicity; adult; Amphipoda; Article; benthic fauna; bioavailability; Brazil; chronic toxicity; coastal waters; community sample; concentration (parameters); controlled study; copepod; correlational study; ecotoxicity; female; female subfertility; heavy metal poisoning; mortality; nonhuman; predictor variable; quality control; resource partitioning; risk assessment; sediment; species composition; toxicity testing; trophic level; tropical bay sediment; water contamination; analysis; animal; bay; chemistry; environmental monitoring; procedures; sediment; water pollutant; Brazil; Rio de Janeiro [Brazil]; Sepetiba Bay; Copepoda; Amphipoda; Animals; Bays; Biological Availability; Brazil; Environmental Monitoring; Geologic Sediments; Metals; Sulfides; Trace Elements; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85019601624

The Program is focused on developing and advancing technologies that address the overarching technical challenges of geologic storage, with the goal to achieve technology readiness for widespread commercial deployment in the 2025-2035 timeframe. The Program approaches these challenges through integration of the technologies developed in the ""Advanced Storage"" component of the Program and field tested in the ""Storage Infrastructure"" component. The Carbon Storage Program is now well positioned to begin feasibility projects on commercial-scale saline storage complexes, building upon almost two decades of knowledge and experience gained from Storage Infrastructure field projects. An early key milestone was the implementation of the Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnership (RCSP) Initiative. Experience and knowledge gained from these field projects provide a firm foundation for future larger-scale field projects, either onshore or offshore. Perhaps most importantly, it is only by performing these field projects that the knowledge needed to identify additional subsurface reservoir and operational issues still requiring further research can be acquired. © 2017 The Authors.","accomplishments; carbon capture and storage (CCS) research; field projects; geologic storage technologies; National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL); Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSP); U.S. DOE Carbon Storage Program","Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Software testing; accomplishments; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbon sequestration; Carbon storage; field projects; Geologic storage; National Energy Technology Laboratory; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029652674

The five 2016 Revised Edition BPMs cover the following topics: Site Screening, Site Selection, and Site Characterization for Geologic Storage Projects; Public Outreach and Education for Geologic Storage Projects; Risk Management and Simulation for Geologic Storage Projects; Monitoring, Verification, and Accounting (MVA) for Geologic Storage Projects; and Operations for Geologic Storage Projects. Taken separately, each topical BPM serves as a practical, stand-alone guide for conducting specific project activities. Taken together, the five BPMs are interrelated and should provide comprehensive and interdisciplinary strategies for conducting successful geologic storage projects from inception to completion. © 2017 The Authors.","and Accounting (MVA); Best Practice Manuals (BPMs); Monitoring; National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL); public outreach; Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSPs); risk management and simulation; U.S. DOE Carbon Storage Program; Verification","Carbon dioxide; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Mergers and acquisitions; Monitoring; Risk management; Site selection; Storage management; Verification; and Accounting (MVA); Best practices; Carbon sequestration; Carbon storage; National Energy Technology Laboratory; Public outreaches; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85029622680
