In this study, apparent reaction orders of NO reduction by graphite, resin char, and Wyodak coal char were investigated at different temperatures and pressures in the kinetic control regime. The results indicate that reaction orders increase from zero to unity as temperature increases. In the lowtemperature regime, reaction rate is determined by a desorption process, which is a very weak function of NO pressure; in the high-temperature regime, direct NO attack, a first-order reaction, determines the overall rate. The behavior at intermediate temperatures is determined by the sum of two processes. This resolves a long-standing discrepancy between the claim that the process is desorption controlled at low temperatures and reports of apparent first order. There is evidence of very long timescale dynamics associated with rearrangement of surface oxides at low temperatures, which can significantly affect the observed rates and therefore observed apparent reaction orders. Previously reported first-order kinetics with cleaned samples at low temperatures reflect complicated transient rather than steady-state behavior. The determination of correct apparent reaction order in fixed-bed reactors is complicated by the long times needed to reach true steady state and by the possibility of surface-catalyzed reaction of NO with product CO.",,"Coal gasification; Desorption; Nitrogen oxides; Pressure effects; Rate constants; Thermal effects; Reaction order; Wyodak coal char; Coal combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032265290

We studied ground water from the uranium mill tailings site near Tuba City, Arizona (USA). Experiments with the ground water were conducted in the presence of the Navajo sandstone host rock. Uranium in solution is complexed by carbonate. Two indigenous denitrifying bacteria were identified Pseudomonas aeruginosa and P. stutzeri, and one sulfate reducing bacterium, Shewanella putrefaciens, also known as Fe(III)-reducer. S. putrefaciens can use U(VI) as an electron acceptor, instead of Fe(III). Ethanol was used as the organic carbon source. Microbially mediated reactions are sequential in the order of decreasing redox intensity. Metabolic reduction of nitrate to gaseous species (N2, N2O) was complete within 1 week at 16°C. The sulfate concentration remained constant. Some of the U(VI) coprecipitated with aragonite/calcite or was adsorbed on biomass during denitrification. Subsequently, the enzymatically catalyzed reduction of U(VI) to U(IV) was complete within 3 weeks but was accompanied by reduction of sulfate to sulfide. U(IV) precipitated as a uraninite solid solution (U, Ca)O2, adhering to the bacteria. The final concentration in solution was ≤1 μg/l. U(VI) was not reduced by sulfide. Complexation of U(VI) by carbonate made its reduction by sulfide even slower than in pure water. The bio-catalyzed reaction is the faster process under the conditions given by the composition of the ground water.

Detailed description and sizing of such system are presented. Separation between the external leaf and solar chimney's external glazing is optimized. The proposed roof solar chimney alone is able to create an air flow rate up to 1.6 kg/s at a mean incident solar radiation of 850W/m2. The maximum air velocity derived in the chimney is about 1.1m/s. At an average incident solar radiation 575W/m2, and air velocity in the chimney of 0.9m/s, the average mass flow rate is found as 1.3 kg/s. For a wind speed of 4.0 m/s the cooled cavity can create a mass flow of 0.35 kg/s. The system may be applied to more than one storey building.

The smaller decrease in total NO is due to significant increase of NO from traffic. Air-pollutant concentrations in both parts of Germany before and after 1989 will be compared and their development will be discussed, based on precipitation and cloud chemistry data from long-term continuous record. Sectoral rain data, based on backward trajectory calculations, clearly show that the significant decline in annual volume weighted precipitation ions (sulphate, calcium, ammonium, chloride) in rain water from sector 'East' since 1989 and particularly since about 1992 is roughly correlated with a similar percentage decline in SO2, dust and NH3 emissions for the region East Germany. The acidity of the precipitation from sector 'East' has increased very strikingly from 1993 up to 1995 threefold more than from sector 'West'. Despite the strong decrease in SO2 emission, this decrease of the atmospheric neutralising capacity was caused by the much steeper decline in atmospheric base cations in that region. Precipitation data from all transport directions show high variation, but no significant trend in the annual average H+ ion concentration. At Mt. Brocken the annual average volume weighted cloud-water acidity during frost-free periods increased by a factor of three between 1992 and 1995. This result, confirmed also by the annual frequency distributions of the pH values, reflects the atmospheric pollutant loading also from all entry sectors. After 1995 this trend is reversed. Detailed classification of the cloud-water data by entry sector, and by meteorological and especially microphysical factors is currently being carried out and preliminary results are presented.","Cloud chemistry; Emission; Precipitation chemistry; Trend","Cloud chemistry; Air quality; Ammonia; Atmospheric chemistry; Gas emissions; Hydrochloric acid; Nitrogen oxides; Precipitation (meteorology); Sulfur dioxide; Air pollution; ammonia; calcium; chloride; hydrochloric acid; nitrogen oxide; proton; rain; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; political change; precipitation quality; air monitoring; air pollutant; air pollution; article; calculation; cloud; dust; exhaust gas; german democratic republic; photochemistry; pollution transport; precipitation; priority journal; traffic; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345451617

The rise in CO2 emissions is hindering the drive to minimize the `Greenhouse Effect' and other more noxious emissions are causing a deterioration in urban air quality. Urban transport is estimated to account for over 20% of total CO2 emissions in the USA, of which up to 50% is due to energy wasted in braking. The figure worldwide could well be approaching this. Assuming that 60% of this energy is recoverable through regenerative braking, it is possible that total global CO2 emissions could be reduced by 4% by implementation of currently available brake energy recovery technologies. The reduction in other emissions could be far more significant due to the optimized engine management systems which such technologies allow.

The OK-4/Duke UV PEL is a high intensity source of tunable monochromatic photons in the 3-10 eV energy range. This tunability is unique and allows us to operate near the photoemission threshold of any samples and thus maximize sample contrast while keeping chromatic aberrations in the PEEM minimal. We have recorded first Images from a variety of samples using spontaneous radiation from the OK-4/Duke UV PEL in the photon energy range of 4.0-6.5 eV. Due to different photothreshold emission from different sample areas, emission from these areas could be turned on (or off) selectively. We have also observed relative intensity reversal with changes in photon energy which are interpreted as density-of-state contrast. Usable image quality has been achieved, even though the output power of the FEL in spontaneous emission mode was several orders of magnitude lower than the anticipated full laser power.

These reports provide a rich source of data for analysis of the CMAQ program, although the data have various limitations. A methodology to estimate potential effects of the CMAQ program on emissions of volatile organic compounds, oxides of nitrogen, and carbon monoxide using data provided by the states to FHWA is presented. Using this methodology, a preliminary assessment of the emissions effect of the CMAQ program from its inception in 1992 through 2005 is presented. It is suggested that the CMAQ program is playing a significant role in reducing emissions nationwide.

On an annual basis the CO2 flux from the deep source toward the atmosphere (6.3 g C m-2 yr-1) is balanced by a similar influx of soluble organic carbon (SOC) from sewage effluents. The δ13C values of soil CO2 indicate that CO2 is produced from plant material in the root zone and from biodegradation of total sedimentary organic carbon in the capillary fringe. High CO2 concentration in the capillary fringe (up to 2%) is likely to reflect a decrease in diffusivity relative to the unsaturated zone due to increase in both water content and tortuosity induced by the capillary fringe structure. The long residence time of SOC and CO2 in the unsaturated zone (29 years at the study site) suggests that the unsaturated zone of deep aquifers may have a significant storage capacity for carbon and may act as a temporary carbon sink.",,"aquifer; carbon dioxide; aquifer; capillary fringe; carbon dioxide; sink; unsaturated zone; Aquifers; Biodegradation; Effluents; Groundwater; Hydrogeology; Organic carbon; Sewage; Capillary fringe; Plant material; Production of CO; Residence time; Sewage effluents; Steady state; Storage capacity; Unsaturated zone; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031972436

TEM studies showed that they were monocrystalline. The average x-value of the formed whiskers could be controlled by varying the weighed-in ratio of Ta2O5 to TiO2 and the synthesis temperature.

Experimental and theoretical estimates of reduction of the emission of nitrogen oxides in electric furnaces with a lining with an intensifying refractory coating of the IVA-2 and IVAKS-2 types and an algorithm for calculating the emission of nitrogen oxides are presented. The plotted process of metal heating in an electric furnace shows that the use of IVA-2 and IVAKS-2 refractory coatings decreases the emission of nitrogen oxides by 22-28% both in a still oxidizing medium and under forced feeding of air into the heating zone. A method for calculating the characteristics of the process of emission of nitrogen oxides in electric furnaces is suggested. Results of the work can be applied to heating and heat-treatment furnaces of forging and rolling mills, especially in enviromentally vulnerable regions.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032335472

The experimental structural data are revisited and some new results are found which differ significantly from those available in the literature. The calculated local structure parameters and electronic transition energies which can be compared to experiments are found to be very good; new structural and spectroscopic results are produced which have been neither measured nor calculated, which are complementary to the available ones, and whose quality is expected to be high as well. In particular, the question of the competition of the excited-state absorptions with the potential vibronic laser emission has been adressed: A considerable overlap between the broad 2 Eg →2 A1g excited-state absorption and 4 A2g ←4 T2g emission bands is predicted in both materials, which must result in a reduction in the emission efficiency. Finally, it is shown that the quantum mechanical embedding effects due to the fact that the external Cs+, Na+, Y3+, Cl-, and Br- ions are not point charges, are non-negligible; lacking of these effects must be one of the reasons which make previous Density Functional Theory calculations show significantly larger discrepancies with the available experiments. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0012390617

The influence of preheating inlet air on NOX emission was also investigated at different fuel/air equivalence ratio. A single cylinder Hydra research engine was used, running at 1500 rpm over a wide range of fuel/air equivalence ratio (0.7-1.1). It was observed that by using the 30% iso-butanol-gasoline blend the maximum level of NOX emission is reduced by 9% compared to gasoline and the reduction of NOX level was evident in the rich region. The experimental investigations were performed under different values of inlet air temperatures. Preheating the inlet air above ambient temperature causes the NOX emission level to increase for all fuel/air equivalence ratios. At Φ = 0.90, a 10% increase in NOX was observed when the inlet air temperature increased from 40 to 60 C. For 30% iso-butanol-gasoline blend experimental results show that preheating inlet air causes knock and misfire 1.0 occur at less advanced ignition timing. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Hlth. the Environ., Netherlands","Land-use emissions of greenhouse gases make up over one-third of current total anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and about three-quarters of the total anthropogenic emissions of CH4 and N2O. Considering their contribution to global emissions, it is important to understand their future trends in order to anticipate and mitigate climate change. This paper reviews published scenarios of major categories of these emissions with the aim to provide background information for the development of new scenarios. These categories include CO2 from deforestation, CH4 from rice cultivation, CH4 from enteric fermentation of cattle, and N2O fertilizer application. Base year estimates of all these categories varied greatly from reference to reference, and hence emissions of all scenarios were normalized relative to their 1990 value before being compared to one another. The range of published scenarios of CO2 emissions from deforestation is widest around the middle of the 21(st) century and then all scenarios converge to low values towards 2100. By contrast, the different scenarios of CH4 and N2O diverge with time, showing their widest range in 2100. Global emissions of CH4 from rice cultivation vary by a factor of three in 2100 and N2O from fertilized soils by a factor of 2.3. Emissions of CH4 from enteric fermentation of animals have the smallest range (factor of 2.0). The typical long-range trends of land-use emission scenarios vary greatly from region to region - they stabilize in industrialized regions after a few decades, but tend to stabilize later in developing regions or continue to grow throughout the 21(st) century. To improve the realism of the estimates of future trends of land-use emissions, it is especially important to improve the estimation of the future extent of agricultural land and the rate of deforestation, while taking into account significant driving forces such as the demand for agricultural commodities and crop yields.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate change; Climate change mitigation; Emission; Greenhouse gas emissions; Land-use emissions; Methane emissions; Nitrous oxide emissions; Scenarios","air pollution; ammonia; carbon dioxide; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; fermentation; nitrous oxide; carbon emission; climate change; greenhouse gas; land use",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032313417

It is found that the dominant reaction mechanism is a two-step process: knock out of one neutron followed by the decay of the 5He resonance. The shape of the (α + n) two-body invariant mass spectrum is interpreted as mainly reflecting the 5He ground state which is a Jπ= 3/2- resonance. However, no evidence for correlations between α particles and neutrons is observed in the momentum widths of the distributions.

Winner of the Presidential Award for Sustainable Development and the California Governor's Award for Economic and Environmental Leadership, the program has reduced air pollution, particularly in unregulated and under-regulated sectors, generated new jobs and businesses, and helped convert defense contractors to high-technology manufacturing. More than 60 agencies, manufacturers, support organizations, and users have participated; more than $22 million in projects have been funded. The program was started in 1988 with $7 million from oil companies constructing multi-billion dollar local production facilities. The money was earmarked for innovative low-emissions technology projects to reduce the substantial air quality impacts caused by construction of those facilities. For every dollar of original funding, the program has secured two to five dollars from other participants, including federal, state, and local government agencies, utilities, and businesses. The program's objectives are to help the county attain federal and state clean air standards for ozone, to work cooperatively with businesses to help them achieve compliance, to jump-start availability of certain technologies, to retain local businesses, and to create new business oppurtunities. As clean air technologies have matured, the program's focus has made the transition from promotion of early demonstrations of new technologies to new areas. Examples include projects that promote cleaner technologies in marine, agricultural, and transportation applications.

Most of the common drawbacks have been eradicated through the new design which is integrated through the well known floating gate MOSFET technology. Advantages including improved thermal and optical stabilization and easy direct modulation are realized from a new on-chip laser driver. Besides, the technique guarantees compensation for device leakage and device to device tolerances. The resulting device is cheaper and easy to construct. The voltage control provides better output power modulation and improve linearity for high output power levels. The threshold current required to stimulate emission is also reduced to ≃ 103 A/cm2 at 300 K with an active region thickness of ≃ 0.5 μm. In fact the proposed design provides a thinner well defined active region (0.3 μm) which also acts as an optical cavity resonator, besides satisfying the conditions for the confinement of charged carriers and optical fields.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032459621

The observed near-IR nuclear colors are consistent with a mixture of emissions from an old stellar population and unreddened hot dust. However, if the hot dust is located in the inner part of the dusty torus invoked in unified schemes, the dust emission should suffer substantial reddening. We show that the near-IR nuclear colors may also be reproduced with a combination of emission from unreddened starlight and hot (T = 1200 K) dust reddened by AV ≈ 5-30 mag. All of the galaxies exhibit an unresolved nuclear source at L. The circumnuclear colors (in a 0.5-1.0 kpc annulus) are similar to those of normal spiral galaxies in most cases, although some galaxies exhibit extended emission at L′, presumably from hot dust, which causes the circumnuclear K - L′. colors to be redder than for normal galaxies. We argue that the circumnuclear hot dust in NGC 1068 and NGC 4151 is probably heated by young stars. A detailed study of the morphologies of the central and circumnuclear regions of the galaxies in our sample is presented. We have constructed smooth models of the old stellar population by fitting elliptical isophotes to the J- and K-band images. The model-divided images are examined for the presence of isophotal deviations from elliptical symmetry, such as internal bars, spiral arms, etc., and compared with the structures seen in optical emission-line images, to study the relative orientations of bars, the EELRs, the nuclear radio emission, and the host galaxy. We find stellar bars in NGC 1068 and NGC 4253 whose orientations are consistent with those of their EELRs and evidence for double bars (or ""bars within bars"") in Mrk 573, NGC 3081, and NGC 3393. Only in NGC 2110 and NGC 4151 do we find no significant isophotal deviations from elliptical symmetry. Finally, there is an alignment on small scales between the near-IR continuum and the line emission in four galaxies, NGC 1068, NGC 2110, NGC 3081, and NGC 4253. These results seem to suggest that there is not a unique explanation for the orientation of the EELRs seen in Seyfert galaxies. In some cases, the EELRs could represent gas aligned with the nuclear stellar bars, whereas in others, they are more likely to be related to gas escaping along the minor axis of the galaxies. © 1998.

Litter effects were significant for all data sets, indicating that within-year effects of common environment and (or) non-additive genotype were important for birth weight and should be included in genetic evaluation programmes. Estimates of variance components for autumn-born lambs differed significantly from those obtained from spring-born lambs or from the combined data. In contrast, estimates obtained for the two sets of spring-born lambs did not differ from those obtained when data on all spring-born lambs were pooled. The estimate of h2 for birth weight in spring-born lambs was over twice as large as that obtained for autumn-born lambs (0·26 v. 0·12). In contrast, the across-year repeatability of ewe effects was much larger in autumn lambs (0·41 v. 0·26) as was the full-sib littermate correlation (0·73 v. 0·49). Mean birth weights were also 0·4 to 0·6 kg less in autumn lambs. These results suggest that negative effects on birth weight that have been reported for lambs gestated during summer in equatorial and subtropical regions are also manifested (albeit at reduced levels) in less extreme climates (in this case, 37°, 15′ N latitude and 654 m elevation) and that maternal variation exists in the ability of the ewe to maintain adequate lamb birth weights in autumn lambing systems.","Birth weight; Genetic parameters; Seasonal variation; Sheep",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032188139

The carbonate reservoirs developed along the eastern flank of the Oxfordian - Kimmeridgian intra-shelf depression in offshore Abu Dhabi received less attention. until recently when commercial oil accumulations in structural traps were discovered. A multidisciplinary study using sequence stratigraphic approach resulted in clarifying the geometry and the chronostratigraphic relationships of the identified sequences. The study included regional seismic data, litho-biofacies studies, geochemical analysis, strontium isotope age dating and well logs from over 50 wells. After the deposition of the Callovian Upper Araej member, a differentiated carbonate platform was initiated in early Oxfordian in offshore and western onshore Abu Dhabi where tectonic subsidence coupled with sea level fluctuation controlled the geometry, deposition and the distribution of variable lithofacies that ranged from organic rich limemudstones in the depressed area to porous and permeable bioclastic packstones. grainstones and dolomites in the shallow waters along the eastern flank of the intrashelf basin. Detailed study resulted in identifying four 3rd-order sequences in the Oxfordian to Middle Kimmeridgian stages in the offshore area. Sequence-1 is entirely Oxfordian and is deposited during transgressive and highstand periods dominated by aggrading and prograding geometries. Sequence II is Lower Kimmeridgian and represented by a well-defined lowstand system tract followed by short-lived transgressive and highstand system tracts. Sequence III is mainly deposited during a lowstand period capped with a shelf margin wedge system tract. Finally, Sequence IV was deposited entirely during transgressive and highstand periods on an undifferentiated platform with minor depression in the western area. Two type I sequence boundaries have been interpreted at the top of Sequences I and II in the shelfal area.

Different samples were obtained varying the Eu3+ content and the Eu3+:ligand ratio. Formation of the complexes and their stoichiometry have been assessed by elemental chemical analysis (combustion and atomic absorption) and thermogravimetry-differential scanning calorimetry as well as IR and diffuse reflectance (DR) spectroscopies. The distinctive feature of DR spectra of the solids is the presence of a band of medium intensity in the 500 nm region that is absent for the same complexes in solution. All the samples, including those that do not contain any organic ligand, exhibit room-temperature emission upon laser excitation, although luminescence intensity notably increases upon complexation. The emission lifetimes are in the millisecond time scale and do not follow simple first-order kinetics. Concerning the emission decay, the following observations were made: (i) the complex luminescence is much longer lived inside the zeolites than in solution; (ii) the emission lifetime follows the order dpic &gt; phen &gt; bipy &gt; bfta; (iii) lifetime increases with the amount of the ligand incorporated; (iv) the decays are more rapid as the Eu3+ content of the zeolite increases; and (v) emission becomes longer lived in the older ZSM-5 &gt; mordenite &gt; Y. These facts have been rationalized as the result of an increase in the conformational rigidity experienced by the complex that impedes alternative nonemissive deactivation pathways in zeolite media. Dehydration of the solids and subsequent D2O rehydration does not alter the decay of the uncomplexed Eu3+-Y samples but increases the lifetime of the Eu-btfa complex inside Y zeolite by a factor of 2. This is indicative that emitting Eu3+ are not solvated (probably located inside the sodalite cages and hexagonal prisms), while the Eu-btfa complex is coordinated with a single H2O molecule.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000444552

The Gent PM10 air sampler equipped with Norwegian Institute for Air Research (NILU) stacked filter units (SFU) was used for air particulate matter sampling. Filter loads were measured by gravimetry and elemental concentration analysis carried out with both PIXE and INAA techniques. In this work we report the results obtained in a rural area located at 30 km east of Oporto, near a coal fired power plant. The samples were collected from September 1995 to August 1996 on a twice a week basis. The use of complementary analytical techniques allowed to determine concentrations for 23 elements. Time variations for both total particulate mass and elemental concentrations are presented. Enrichment factors were calculated for the fine (PM < 2 μm) and the coarse (10 > PM > 2 μm) fractions. Principal Components Analysis was applied to infer particulate mass emission sources. Another Gent air sampler was installed at the same sampling site but under different working conditions. Time averages obtained with the two systems are also compared. The results obtained with the two collectors operating under different conditions suggest that the statistical distribution of pollutants can be accounted by taking the average of a week and therefore a weekly monitoring of airborne particulate matter is proposed. A factor related to the coal fired power plant emissions has been identified. Since the power plant is going to be converted from coal to natural gas combustion, the results now obtained are important for a future comparison. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.",,"Air filters; Atmospheric aerosols; Combustion; Fossil fuel power plants; Industrial emissions; Particulate emissions; Rural areas; Sampling; Statistical methods; Principal component analysis; Proton induced X ray emission; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032017084

We analyze a 59-year data set from the Desert Experimental Range, southwester Utah, with the objective of discriminating between grazing and non-grazing effects on cover dynamics. Canopy cover of (5 x 20 ft) 9.3 m2 plots were estimated in 1935, 1958, 1969, 197, and 1994. Treatments were time (5 dates), grazing (ungrazed versus grazed), and season (spring versus winter). Time was significant; total cover initially increased following release from uncontrolled grazing and improvement of climate (1935-58, P &lt; 0.001), remained unchanged over the following dry interval (1958-69, P = 1.000), increased over a drier interval (1969-75, P &lt; 0.001), and then decreased dramatically over the final wet period (1975-94, P &lt; 0.001). Grazing was also significant (P &lt; 0.001), but cover of ungrazed plots exceeded that of grazed plots only in 1975 and 1994 (P ≤ 0.033). The 6 dominant species showed varying responses to grazing and time, with some responding primarily to grazing (e.g., budsage, Artemisia spinescens D.C. Eaton in Wats.) and others responding primarily to time (climate, longevity, etc., e.g., Indian ricegrass, Oryzopsis hymenoides R. and S.). Similarly, seasonal effects were not universal. Shrub cover initially increased and then declined dramatically while grass cover monotonically increased. Results suggest that release from uncontrolled grazing coupled with improving climatic conditions were responsible for initial recovery of the community, but that over time, climate and inherent plant traits (e.g., longevity, establishment ecology, etc.) became relatively more important. For total cover and for many individual species, continued grazing affected the rate more than the direction of vegetation change.","Artemisia spinescens; Atriplex confertifolia; Ceratoides lanata; Climate; Hilaria jamesii; Oryzopsis hymenoides; Sporobolus cryptandrus; Vegetation dynamics","climate; community shadscale; grazing; plant cover; plant trait; USA; Utah; Acer pensylvanicum; Achnatherum hymenoides; Amaranthaceae; Animalia; Artemisia; Artemisia spinescens; Atriplex; Atriplex confertifolia; Atriplex confertifolia; Atriplex confertifolia; Ceratoides; Chenopodiaceae; Hilaria; Krascheninnikovia lanata; Lanata; Oryzopsis; Ovis aries; Pleuraphis jamesii; Sporobolus cryptandrus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642606986

Traditionally, the emissions have been strongly connected to earlier steps in the material flows (extraction and raw-materials intensive industry), but during the last few decades, the emissions from industrial pointsources have decreased radically in the Western industrialized world. The result of the industrial 'cleanup' is a shift towards the latter steps of the societal material flows; the relative importance of consumption emissions has increased. As indicated in studies of the Rhine Basin, important prerequisites for this development have been increasing environmental awareness and public opinion, putting pressure on legislators, authorities and companies and a dynamic industrial development with structural changes, that have permitted investments in modern technology and emissions control. Despite the often radical emission reductions, problems with acidification, eutrophication, diffusion of persistent organic chemicals and climate change still persist on a regional and global level. During the last decade, there has been an increasing emphasis on the international and global environmental problems. The materials flow perspective has experienced a major breakthrough. Waste minimization, recycling, life-cycle analysis and environmental auditing have become major themes in most European countries and have also started to influence industry. The importance of the consumer and his attitudes and actions, as well as the relationship between trade and environment are often emphasized in this context. The industrial metabolism approach needs further development to be able to assist in meeting the modern challenges of environmental management. To sum up flows of a few elements or products in a limited region is not sufficient. It is necessary to develop the analysis of the context of the flows, include industrial, economic and geographical change in the analysis and more actively seek connection to political and industrial decision-making and human behavior and attitudes. The time-geographical Process Landscape launched by Torsten Hagerstrand could be an important source of inspiration in this context.","Industrial metabolism; Material flows; Research challenges; The process landscape; The Rhine","emissions control; environmental economics; environmental ethics; industrialisation; Europe, Rhine Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031910942

Hibernating mammals survive for periods up to 6 mo in the absence of food by minimizing carbohydrate catabolism and using triglyceride stores as their primary source of fuel. The cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying the changes from a state of activity to the hibernating state are poorly understood; however, the selective expression of genes offers one level of control. To address this problem, we used a differential gene expression screen to identify genes that are responsible for the physiological characteristics of hibernation in the heart of the thirteen- lined ground squirrel (Spermophilus tridecemlineatus). Here, we report that genes for pancreatic lipase and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 are up-regulated in the heart during hibernation. Pancreatic lipase is normally expressed exclusively in the pancreas, but when expressed in the hibernating heart it liberates fatty acids from triglycerides at temperatures as low as 0°C. Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase isozyme 4 inhibits carbohydrate oxidation and depresses metabolism by preventing the conversion of pyruvate to Ac-CoA. The resulting anaerobic glycolysis and low-temperature lipid catabolism provide evidence that adaptive changes in cardiac physiology are controlled by the differential expression of genes during hibernation.",,"acetyl coenzyme a; carbohydrate; pyruvate dehydrogenase; pyruvic acid; triacylglycerol; triacylglycerol lipase; adaptation; anaerobic glycolysis; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; carbohydrate metabolism; gene activity; gene expression; gene expression regulation; hibernation; lipolysis; metabolism; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; pancreas; priority journal; squirrel; Animals; Carbon; Cloning, Molecular; DNA, Complementary; Gene Expression Regulation; Hibernation; Molecular Sequence Data; Myocardium; Sciuridae; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032493362

Four sets of indicators were developed to represent the principle components of management capability. These were the air quality measurement index, data assessment and availability index, emissions estimates index, and management enabling capabilities index. Existing capabilities could be more effectively utilized in many cities for developing and implementing management strategies. Additional resources could be used to further characterize air quality and emissions if management strategies are formulated and rigorously carried out. However, many nations, despite establishing emissions control plans, do not act on these due to the lack of the necessary expertise and capabilities to formulate policies; low priority given to reducing air pollution; lack of financial resources or concern over the economic impact of introducing policies to control emissions, insufficient political will; and complications concerning policy making.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032471171

Also, the range of climatic zones is great over the distribution of the Russian wheat aphid in the United States. Therefore, the effects of wheat growth stage and climate on Russian wheat aphid damage potential were determined. Experiments were conducted in 4 states (Texas, Colorado, Montana, and Washington) encompassing the Great Plains and Pacific Northwest to determine the damage potential and economic injury level for the Russian wheat aphid. The growth stages included 2 leaves (Zadoks growth stage 12), 2 tillers (stage 22), beginning of spring regrowth (≈stage 29), 1st node (stage 31), and preboot (stage 45). Three levels of Russian wheat aphid infestation were used: 5, 10, and 20 aphids per plant for stage 12 plants and 20, 40, and 80 aphids at all other growth stages. Also, there was a no Russian wheat aphid check treatment. This paper reports on damage potential data. Russian wheat aphid densities and percentage of the tillers that were infested or damaged were lower in the fall than in the spring. Infestations in the tall reduced bulk grain weight and number of spikes per plant. These losses were higher in the northern states than in Texas. We suspect that this difference was due to a reduction in winter hardiness in the northern states. In the spring, Russian wheat aphid damage resulted in a reduction in number of seeds per spike, 200-seed weight, and foliage dry weight. Plants damaged in the spring produced as many spikes as uninfested plants. However, the quantity and quality of seed were reduced by spring infestations.","Climate; Damage potential; Growth stage; Russian wheat aphid; Winter wheat",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0242537700

The first type of carbonate is biogenic-syngenetic in origin and was formed in low-temperature euxinic aquatic environments by the reduction of dissolved sulfates and the oxidation of organic matter by sulfate-reducing bacteria. The resulting carbonate and sulfur are stratigraphically restricted within the evaporite sequence and occur as interlaminated gypsum-calcite-sulfur, or as sulfur ooids, sulfur globules, and stromatolitic sulfur that are enclosed in gypsum or calcite. The biogenic-syngenetic carbonate and sulfur did not originate from petroleum and have a significance of euxinic aquatic settings. The second type of carbonate is a biogenic-epigenetic carbonate that formed under low temperatures by biochemical reactions between seeping hydrocarbons and the overlying Miocene evaporites. The carbonate is vuggy, is included within or caps the evaporites, and usually shows hydrocarbon stains or emits a hydrocarbon smell. The sulfur is usually yellow, but may be brown to black due to bitumen staining. Carbonates replace gypsum or anhydrite and occur as aragonite, calcite, or dolomite. The δ 13C mean values for carbonate minerals range from -7.8 to -27.2‰ PDB, being relatively heavier than the δ 13C values of the nearby crude oil (-28.1 to -29-3‰ PDB). Carbon isotope values indicate that these carbonates were formed from the heavier organic carbon dioxide under reducing conditions, where the lighter methane is stable. The occurrence of biogenic-epigenetic carbonates and sulfur in the evaporite deposits of the Gulf of Suez petroliferous basin is similar to that recorded in other basins such as the Gulf Coast basins of Texas, Louisiana, and southern Mexico; the Fergana and Amudarya depression of central Asia; and the Mesopotamian depression in Iraq. The biogenic-epigenetic carbonates or sulfur in some regions is considered as a criterion for petroleum microseepage that may indicate a potential hydrocarbon-bearing reservoir at depth.",,"Biochemistry; Carbon; Carbonate minerals; Exploratory geochemistry; Isotopes; Methane; Petroleum reservoirs; Redox reactions; Sulfur; Biogenic carbonates; Petroleum geology; biogenic carbonate; hydrocarbon potential; Egypt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032004816

Aqueous solutions of H2SO4, HClO4 and CF3SO3H have been used. In order to produce r-CO2 adsorbates, different adsorption potentials (Ead) in the H-atom electrosorption potential range and in the hydrogen evolution region (HER) were chosen. The values of charge density of adsorbate oxidation (qox) depend on Ead, on the solution composition and on the adsorption time (tad). At constant Ead and tad, qox increases in the following order: H2SO4 &lt; CF3SO3H &lt; HClO4 in agreement with the adsorption strength of anions. The same sequence was observed in the oxidation peak potentials of the adsorbates produced. To analyzed the influence of r-CO2 adsorbates in the HER, polarization curves have also been recorded. Studies have been carried out with in situ infrared reflectance spectroscopy. Three techniques were employed: SNIFTIRS, SPAIRS and potential steps. Several main IR bands are observed and associated with CO2 and CO (COB bridge-bonded and COL linearly bonded). Other bands are also observed between 1000-1800 cm-1 which show the existence of other adsorbed species as well as around 1000-1100 and 2800-3000 cm-1. This observation leads to the supposition that another more reduced species is formed from CO2. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.

To consider CO2 as a feedstock, one has to consider the purity, reactivity, operational conditions, customer preferences, transportation costs, and availability of the CO2. Since CO2 is a global problem, local efforts to reduce CO2 emissions will have limited impact, except to convert waste CO2 to a more valued chemical product. Some have suggested that H2 offers a good approach to remove CO2, but use of H2 as the reducing agent must address the source and cost of the H2. Most H2 is produced by steam reforming of hydrocarbons which is also a source for CO2; thus use of conventional sources of H2 is not a practicable solution to destroying CO2. New non-fossil fuel routes to H2 production might enhance the use of H2 as the reductant, but initial production of chemicals, even if cost competitive, from CO2 is expected to have limited impact on worldwide CO2 emissions. Issues that impact H2 supply and cost will be discussed, since these may be a part of any CO2 solution.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0011190131

The generation of temperature distributions inside the fluidized bed is the result of a competition between two mechanisms: local feeding of reactants creates heat of reaction locally, and this heat must be dispersed inside the bed by solids mixing. The present work investigates these mechanisms for the case of coal combustion in pressurized bubbling fluidized beds. With a simple one-dimensional carbon mass balance, the governing parameters for the generation of temperature profiles are deduced. For the quantitative calculation of temperature, carbon and oxygen distributions, a two-dimensional model was formulated. In pressurized fluidized beds, the fuel is often fed as a coal-water slurry, so the drying of the fuel also has been considered in this model. The model has been validated with measurements made in the pressurized fluidized bed combustor (PFBC) pilot-scale test unit of Deutsche Babcock. The results are in agreement with measurements for full-load as well as part-load conditions. Feeding the coal as a slurry is shown to be a means to flatten the temperature distribution because the slurry agglomerates are dispersed in the fluidized bed while drying. Further simulation results point at and quantify critical parameters that have to be considered in the scaleup of pressurized fluidized bed combustors.",,"Carbon; Coal combustion; Coal water mixtures; Computer simulation; Drying; Mathematical models; Oxygen; Temperature distribution; Exothermic reactions; Fluidized bed combustors; fluidized bed; modeling; temperature distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032029985

An increase in the total plasticizer content resulted in a considerable decrease of elasticity modulus and tensile strength (up to 50% of the original values when 30% plasticizer was added), whereas the percentage elongation increased (up to 150% compared to the original values). The low-temperature preparation method led to the development of a higher percentage renaturation (crystallinity) of gelatin which resulted in a decrease, by one or two orders of magnitude, of CO2 and O2 permeability in the chitosan/gelatin blends.

The major global sources are excreta from domestic animals and fertilizers, but oceans, biomass burning and crops are also important. About 60% of the global NH3 emission is estimated to come from anthropogenic sources. NH3-N emissions are of the same order as the NO(x)-N emissions on both global and European scales. Emitted NH3 returns to the surface mainly in the form of dry deposition of NH3 and wet deposition of ammonium (NH4/+). In countries with high NH3 emission densities, dry deposition of NH3 from local sources and wet deposition of NH4/+ from remote sources dominates the deposition. In countries with low NH3 emission densities only wet deposition of NH4/+ from remote sources dominates the deposition. Surface exchange of NH3 is essentially bi-directional, depending on the NH3 compensation point concentration of the vegetation and the airborne concentration. In general, the compensation point is larger for agricultural than semi-natural plants, and varies with plant growth stage. According to basic thermodynamics the leaf tissue or stomatal compensation point of NH3 doubles for each increase of 5°C. However, exchange of NH3 does not only occur through the stomata, but it can also be deposited to leaf surfaces, as well as emitted back to the atmosphere from drying leaf surfaces. Atmospheric transport and deposition models can be used to interpolate NH3 concentrations and depositions in space and time, to calculate import/export balances and to estimate past or future situations. Adverse effects on sensitive ecosystems caused by high N deposition can be reduced by lowering the emissions and, to a limited extent, also by removing sources close to the ecosystem to be protected.","Ammonia; Compensation point; Deposition models; Dry deposition; Ecosystem protection; Pollution emissions; Wet deposition","ammonia; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric transport; emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031749053

In order to convert the thermodynamically stable and relatively unreactive CO2 molecule into the desired product in an efficient manner, suitable reaction conditions and activation mechanisms must be found. Among the various possible approaches for activating this molecule, electrochemical reduction seems to be quite promising. However, direct electrochemical reduction on most metallic electrodes requires highly negative potentials and results in a variety of products, the distribution of which critically depends on reaction conditions such as electrode materials, solvent systems, and operational parameters including current density and CO2 concentration. This has prompted the search for suitable catalytic systems capable of mediating the electroreduction. Use of catalysts in the electrochemical activation of CO2 seems to offer some advantages both in reducing energy consumption and in product selectivity optimization.

We have considered the possible reduced damage to public health, building materials and agricultural crops that may be obtained from reducing emissions of important air pollutants and also how the program contributes to reduced emissions of greenhouse gases. The measures are described in the National Energy Efficiency Improvement and Energy Conservation Programs (NEEIECP), elaborated by the Hungarian Ministry of Industry and Trade and accepted by the Government in 1994. The energy saving expected from the program is approximately 64 PJ/year. The benefits were estimated using monitoring data and population/recipient data from urban and rural areas in Hungary together with exposure-response functions and valuation estimates mainly from western studies. Our analysis indicates that the main benefit from reducing the concentrations of pollutants relates to public health and that reduced prevalence of chronic respiratory diseases is an important effect. Reduced premature mortality is also important and the estimated attributable risk of air pollution to excess mortality at present is approximately 6%. The estimated annual benefit of improved health conditions alone is likely to exceed the investments needed to implement the program. In addition there are significant benefits due to reduced replacement and maintenance costs for building materials (30-35 million USS annually in Budapest only). The damage to crops due to ozone is large, but a significant improvement in Hungary depends upon concerted actions in several countries.","Air pollution; Benefit transfer; Crop loss; Exposure- response; Health effects; Material damage","air pollution; environmental impact; health impact; medical geography; respiratory disease; air pollution; article; building material; chronic respiratory tract disease; cost benefit analysis; energy conservation; environmental exposure; environmental impact assessment; health status; hungary; pollution control; prevalence; priority journal; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Climate; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Humans; Hungary; Life Expectancy; Power Plants; Public Health; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Hungary",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344653625

Charging scrap, or metallics, with the burden offers several possible benefits including increased productivity and decreased fuel rate. In this paper, scrap charging is investigated numerically using a previously presented mathematical model. Furnace operations at both fixed hot metal temperature and fixed top gas temperature are investigated with scrap charged either near the axis, radially uniformly or near the wall. When the average temperature of metal entering the hearth is kept constant, the production and fuel rate are predicted to increase and decrease respectively as scrap feed rate increases. These changes are due to scrap being already fully reduced, thus not requiring heat or carbon for reduction. However, the top gas temperature decreases, particularly when scrap was charged only over the inner half radius of the furnace. Under conditions of constant top gas temperature the productivity and fuel rate still increase and decrease respectively with increasing scrap: ore ratio. Of the three scrap charging patterns tested, the optimum pattern is to charge scrap over the outer half radius of the furnace, which results in the least change in the furnace internal state compared to operations without scrap while showing significant increases in production and decreases in fuel rate. Finally, scrap diameter is found to have only a small effect on the furnace state. © 1998, The Iron and Steel Institute of Japan.

The reduction state that was determined by phase correspondence characterizes the ""intrinsic"" fluid. Its reduction state was controlled by the bulk-rock chemistry. The oxygen fugacity of the ""intrinsic"" fluid of the rocks roughly corresponds to the magnetite-hematite and ferrosilite-quartz-magnetite buffers. The electrochemical and thermodegassing techniques provide data on the fluid from an external source. This fluid was entrapped by minerals during the retrograde stage of metamorphism, after the redistribution of components between minerals had terminated. The ""extrinsic"" fluid was richer in carbon, and its oxygen fugacity was constrained between the ferrosilite-quartz-magnetite and iozite-wüstite buffers. Hence, the ""intrinsic"" fluid was much more oxidized than the ""extrinsic"" one, which was richer in hydrogen and methane. Physicochemical simulation of the cooling process of the ""extrinsic"" fluid demonstrates that graphite could crystallize from this fluid at temperatures below 600°C. The simulation results were confirmed by the detection, under the electron microscope, of micron-sized graphite inclusions in the rocks. The extrinsic fluid is supposedly the metamorphic fluid that was present in the rocks during their regional metamorphism.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346443434

In order to define these processes we have studied the surface temperatures during rainfall events, the isotopic composition of rain, infiltrating and groundwaters. This study was carded out within a karstic terrain (Soreq Cave), Israel, located in Cenomanian dolomitic rocks, approximately 40 km inland of the Mediterranean Sea, and 400 m above sea level. The climate is typical of the Eastern Mediterranean semi-arid conditions, with a rainy winter and dry summer and the average annual rainfall in the area is ~500 mm. Close monitoring indicates that the δD and δ18O values of individual rainstorm events decrease with increasing rainfall. Annual average isotopic values of years with rainfall of 500-600 mm do not vary systematically. Years with extreme rainfall values define a negative covariation between the δ18O and rainfall. The δD-δ18O relationship of all rain events of more than 20 mm fall on the Mediterranean Meteoric Water Line (MMWL) with a slope of ~8 and d-excesses of 20-30‰. These rain events occur when mid-winter surface temperatures are 5 to 10°C. Rainfall events of less than 20 mm, mainly occurring at above 10°C, have slopes of less than 8 and smaller d-excess as a consequence of evaporation processes beneath the clouds. Two main water-types infiltrating into the cave are recognized: slow- and fast-drip. Slow-drip occurs from the tips of stalactites and takes place throughout the year; these waters represent seepage water that remains in the upper vadose zone for up to several decades. Fast-drip emanates from fissures in the cave roof during the winter seasons; these waters represent vadose flow with a short residence time of less than 1 year. The infiltration of the fast-drip water into the cave depends on the fracture system of the rock cover and on the intensity of the rainstorms. In the inner parts of the cave, where the rock cover is thick, fast-drip starts only after several massive (&gt;20 mm) rainstorms, whereas below a thin roof the response time of fast-drip is a few hours to a few days after intensive rainstorms. Both fast- and slow-drip water fall on the MMWL, indicating that they are derived mainly from the relatively intensive rainstorms that compose about 2/3 of the annual rainfall. Although fast-drip water represents massive rainstorms, their δ18O and δD values are nonetheless higher by ~1‰ and 10‰ respectively, relative to the average rainwater composition, This indicates that the fast-drip water consists predominantly of water derived from intensive rainstorms admixed with a minor component of isotopically 18O- and D-enriched water, which is represented by the slow-drip waters. The fast-drip waters are derived mainly from massive rain events at surface temperatures of 5 to 10°C, which thermally equilibrate with the host rock and upon reaching the cave they have already acquired the mean temperature (~20°C) of the cave.Annual rainfall variations and processes in the upper vadose zone exert a profound influence on the chemical and isotopic compositions of waters of carbonate aquifers in semi-arid regions. These processes were investigated by studying the surface temperatures during rainfall events, the isotopic composition of rain, infiltrating and groundwaters within the karstic terrain (Soreq Cave) in Israel.

Four arguments were raised in favour of their conclusion. Nevertheless, in Kyoto policy-makers decided to adopt near-term targets. In this paper, the arguments for and against deferral of emissions reductions are revisited. It is shown that these arguments can not be assessed in the absence of a discussion about the stabilization target. If a low stabilization target is chosen, then early efforts to abate emissions are necessary, whereas a high stabilization target (say 650 ppm) does not require much effort over the next couple of decades. Finally, a brief discussion of the way that the arguments in favour of delay were perceived in the policy-making community is provided.",,"Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Public policy; Energy systems; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032281319

It is concluded that the polymorphism of 5OCB is of conformation type.

Particulate traps presently available on the market clearly show that the regeneration process is the most important detail in particulate trap technology. In this specific case of particulate traps, active rare earth oxides are added into the fuel to produce an initial and almost continuous regeneration without external burners, resistance heating, etc., as is well known from other systems. It should not be forgotten that an externally initiated regeneration will always produce a temperature peak inside the soot collecting filter media which may destroy them. Such damage can be avoided by catalytically supported regeneration of particulate traps. In the presence of an active catalyst, an inorganic cerium compound, regeneration temperature will decrease from 550 to 600 deg. C normally to about 350 to 400 deg. C. Exhaust gas temperature of modern turbo-charged diesel engines is very often below 200 deg. C during urban traffic. Hence, the passive method with fuel additives is not sufficient to provide trap regeneration during such continuous low engine speed/load conditions. The active trap regeneration process (e. g. with diesel burner and electrical heating of exhaust gas) is very expensive and energy-consuming. This paper explains possibilities for the development of a particulate trap system for many applications, and shows the advantages of combining different regeneration methods for particulate trap systems.

Such differences were maintained and even enhanced in the vegetatively-propagated progenies of control and E-plants, grown under both greenhouse conditions and normal CO2 levels. The above results confirmed previous observations on native and crop plants exposed to elevated CO2.

At a global scale the pattern of climate variation is reflected in the distribution of the world's principal vegetation zones, such as the tropical rainforest and the sub-Polar tundra. At the other end of the scale, subtle changes in siting characteristics such as aspect, slope, soil properties and proximity to open water or urban areas result in local microclimatic variation. This plays a major part in determining the fine detail in the mosaic of habitats across the landscape. The influence of aspect, for example, can often be seen in a sharp contrast between the scree, shallow soil and sparse vegetation on north-facing slopes and the seeper soils and more dense plant cover found on warmer south-facing slopes. On the other hand, the presence of a plant cover creates distinctive small-scale climates, whose characteristics depend on the complex structure of the plant canopy. It is possible to identify variation in microclimate around an individual leaf or underneath a short grass cover, however, the scale of such study requires very sensitive monitoring equipment and is beyond the scope of this article.

P3E 6B5, Canada","The enzyme leach and MMI (mobile metal ion) selective digestions are rapidly gaining popularity in the exploration community because of their successful track record in non-glaciated, arid and tropical climatic regions. Few successful case studies from high-latitude, temperate regions have been published to date. Also lacking is a comprehensive discussion of the constraints and limitations of these geochemical methods and how they affect the successful interpretation of selective-leach survey results in glaciated regions. This paper evaluates each method using specific examples from four case studies undertaken in the glaciated region of northern Ontario. The case studies clearly demonstrate that both the MMI and enzyme leach selective digestions provide the explorationist with useful information, which, when used in conjunction with other exploration tools, can assist with the identification of potential diamond drill targets. Notwithstanding this, the techniques do not appear to work well as 'stand alone' methods. The importance of following strict sampling protocols and obtaining high-quality observational information on the sampling site and media collected cannot be overstressed. It is only by filtering out the many variables that arise in any sampling program that a sound interpretation of the data can be made. The case studies have drawn attention to some of the apparent shortfalls of the techniques. Of these, issues such as the ability to reproduce survey results from year to year and the recognition of anomalous element associations which specifically target blind mineralisation are probably those which require significant follow-up work. Clearly, additional case studies are required from the glaciated regions of the world to assist with the optimisation of geochemical response of MMI and enzyme leach selective extractions. The mechanisms responsible for the formation of surface geochemical anomalies over deeply buried mineralisation are not well understood. The observed patterns of geochemical response in surface soils and both shallow and deep ground waters over concealed mineralisation should assist with the development of new dispersion models.The enzyme leach and mobile metal ions (MMI) selective extraction are evaluated using specific examples from case studies undertaken in the glaciated regions of northern Ontario. The studies showed that enzyme leach and MMI provide good information to the explorationist. Notwithstanding this, the methods do not appear to work well as stand alone methods.

The ground-state twisting of the donor with respect to the acceptor can have a large influence on the charge distribution. The polymeric chain can force a less planar geometry and cause a bathochromic shift and a broadening of the absorption band in the electronic absorption spectra. In the area of 350 nm the emission is assigned to the locally excited state (with a planar geometry) and the emission with λFlmax in the area of 450-520 nm to the TICT state (with a perpendicular conformation). Experimental results show (i) no polymeric chain effect in emission distribution for the DMAB molecule, (ii) a significant red edge effect (REE) for the PIP probe, (iii) a slight red edge effect for 26DMM, (iv) a specific blue edge effect (BEE) for PYR probe, and (v) a combination of REE and BEE for MOR. Adaptation of Grabowski's TICT hypothesis allows one to calculate the activation energy of TICT state formation, the backreaction TICT → LE, and the thermally activated TICT fluorescence. The polymeric chain essentially does not change the activation energy (E1) for the thermally activated TICT state formation, indicating that the polymeric chain does not change the microscopic viscosity in the range affecting measurable changes in the TICT-LE equilibrium. The polymeric chain increases the gap between the lowest forbidden ν0 vibrational state and less forbidden ν1 vibrational state by 195-225 cm-1 (0.6-2.4 kJ mol-1). Experimental results suggest that the polymer chain affects only the vibrational relaxation of tested molecules without any significant effect on the thermodynamics of the TICT and LE states equilibrium.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Activation energy; Charge transfer; Electron energy levels; Esters; Fluorescence; Macromolecules; Molecular vibrations; Polystyrenes; Relaxation processes; Thermodynamics; Chromophores; Molecular dynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031647320

This challenges the temperate agroforestry practice of planting widely spaced trees to produce high quality timber. We analyse tree growth data from recent temperate agroforestry plantations aged three to eight years, featuring low tree plantation densities (50 to 400 stems ha-1), the association of trees with intercrops (silvoarable systems) or animals (silvopastoral systems), and the use of plastic shelter tubes to protect trees (1.2 to 2.5 m high) and avoid damage by cattle or sheep in pastures or facilitate maintenance in silvoarable systems. The plantations are located in climates ranging from Mediterranean, dry central temperate plains, cold and wet central uplands to mild oceanic areas. Some plantations included a forestry control (high density of plantation, no tree shelter, no intercropping nor grazing). Trees were evaluated for height and diameter growth and stem form (straightness and absence of knots). Trees in most agroforestry plots grew satisfactorily, often faster than in forestry control plots. In some experimental plots, average annual height increments as high as I m and diameter increments as high as 1.5 cm were observed. Few agroforestry plantations were unsuccessful, and the reasons for the failUreS are discussed: animal damage in silvopastoral plots, but also a wrong choice of tree species unsuitable for local soil and climate characteristics. From these early results we can formulate some guidelines for designing future agroforestry plantations in temperate climates, concerning tree density, use of tree shelters and care required for widely spaced trees.","Bole quality; Intercropping; Silvoarable systems; Silvopastoral systems; Tree shelter","agroforestry; growth; tree; France",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032464395

Resulting public health effects are complex and not well documented. Respiratory diseases were a major cause of illness and deaths in the 1970s, prior to the escalated economic, industrial, and urban growth of the reform period. There has been some reduction in respiratory disease mortality. While pneumonia deaths have declined in the last two decades, death rates from pollution-related respiratory diseases may have risen. It is still true that the death rate from respiratory diseases is 65 per cent higher in rural than urban areas, and far higher in very poor rural counties than in comparatively well-off rural counties. This suggests that continuing poverty and indoor air pollution are maintaining the high respiratory disease mortality in less advanced rural areas. In cities and prosperous rural areas, some reduction in indoor air pollution may be counteracted by rising ambient air pollution and increased tobacco smoking. Pollution of rivers and lakes has reportedly increased in the economic reform period. Industrial effluents rose alarmingly during the 1980s, but a concerted effort to treat industrial wastewater has been partially successful. Meanwhile, the dumping of untreated urban sewage into water bodies has escalated, so far without abatement. The feared increase in waterborne disease morbidity and mortality has not materialized - at least it is not evident in the available data. Rather, national policies of improving rural and urban water supplies and promoting food safety and hygiene have apparently succeeded in reducing illness and mortality from digestive and intestinal infectious diseases. China's compulsory fertility control policy has reduced population growth to an unusually low level. Given the rapidly growing economy, growth of population is not causing grave problems for China today. In the future, it is likely that population growth will be slow enough and economic growth brisk enough to continue this manageable situation. The public health situation in China has improved dramatically since 1949, and also since the beginning of the economic reforms. Survival chances have risen greatly for both sexes at most ages. Environmental threats to health have lessened enough to allow remarkable reductions in child mortality.

In comparison with the average IUE spectra, the ultraviolet continuum and emission lines appear reduced by factors of, respectively, ≃4 and ≃5. Flickering activity is mostly suppressed and the light curve shows the eclipse of a compact white dwarf at the disc centre which contributes ≃60 per cent of the total light at 3900-4300 Å. We use measurements of contact phases in the eclipse light curve to derive the binary geometry and to estimate masses and relevant dimensions. We find a mass ratio of q = 0.19 ± 0.03 and an inclination of i = 83° ± 2°. The masses of the component stars are M1 = 0.78 ± 0.06 M⊙ and M2 = 0.15 ± 0.03 M⊙. Our photometric model predicts K1 = 83 ± 12 km s-1 and K2 = 436 ± 11 km s-1. The predicted value of K1 is in accordance with the velocity amplitude obtained from the emission lines after a correction for asymmetric line emission in the disc is made. The secondary of V2051 Oph is significantly more massive than the secondaries of the other ultrashort period dwarf novae. V2051 Oph is probably a relatively young system, with a secondary star that has not had enough time to evolve out of thermal equilibrium.","Binaries: close; Eclipses; Novae, cataclysmic variables; Stars: individual: V2051 oph; Ultraviolet: stars",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000246948

Thus N2 fixation associated with the rhizosphere of pines may contribute to their success in nitrogen-limited ecosystems. We used the acetylene-reduction assay with carbon monoxide controls to determine whether high rates of N2 fixation are associated with pine forests in Maine. We measured nitrogenase activity in cores of the forest floor and the mineral soil beneath for five pitch pine, seven red pine, and six eastern white pine (P. strobus L.) stands. The stands represented 8 of the 15 biophysical regions of Maine (USA) and included a variety of age classes. We found only very low rates of nitrogenase activity, which varied seasonally with the highest values during the warmer months. The highest mean nitrogenase activity observed was 449 nmol C2H4·m-2·h-1. We estimated that &lt;6 mg N/m2 was fixed annually by non-symbiotic diazotrophs in the soil horizons sampled. These rates are much smaller than atmospheric N inputs in Maine (300-450 mg N·m-2.yr-1) and consequently have little impact on the N budgets of the pines. Based on our results and the literature, it is likely that only low rates of N2 fixation are associated with pines.","Acetylene reduction; Associative dinitrogen fixation; Dinitrogen fixation, seasonal pattern; Maine (USA) pine stands; Nitrogenase activity; Pine, nitrogen budgets; Pinus resinosa; Pinus rigida; Pinus strobus; Rhizosphere dinitrogen fixation","coniferous forest; nitrogen fixation; rhizosphere; Maine; United States; Pinus caribaea; Pinus resinosa; Pinus resinosa; Pinus rigida; Pinus rigida; Pinus rigida; Pinus strobus; Pinus strobus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031871059

Before fluorescence measurement, the plants were cultivated in the treatments simulating the likely future climate characterized with elevated air temperature and CO2 concentration and combination of both. On fast kinetics curves the risetimes of the I and D points characterizing the redox state of Q(A) were affected by lowering the air temperature. At 5°C both the I and D points were reached later than at 20°C. Also the I to D risetime was prolonged at 5°C and it was found significantly longer in plants cultivated in ambient + 4°C temperature. While a significant difference was found in the area over the rising part of the fluorescence curve between 20 and 5°C, no difference was found in area over the relaxation curve part. Lowering of air temperature to 5°C had no effect on Fv/Fm values in control plants and in the plants cultivated in elevated CO2 but brought significant decrease in plants cultivated in the ambient + 4°C air temperature. Both Φ(II) and qP decreased with the temperature lowered to 5°C while the values of qN increased. The changes in fluorescence parameters indicated altered functioning of PS II at low temperature. The changes in parameters are discussed as a consequence of decreased enzymatic activity, decreased turnover of plastoquinone pool and photoinhibition.","Chlorophyll fluorescence; Doubled CO2; Global changes; Lolium perenne; Perennial ryegrass; Q(A) reduction; Quantum yield of PS II","cold resistance; fluorescence analysis; photosystem II",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032006375

Environmental influences on health and health behavior have an important place in research on worksite health promotion. We tested the validity and internal consistency of a new measure of organizational health and safety climate that was used in a large randomized trial of a worksite cancer prevention program (the Working Well Trial). The resulting scales then were applied to assess intervention effects. Method. This study uses data from a subset of 40 worksites in the Working Well Trial. Employees at 20 natural gas pipeline worksites and 20 rural electrical cooperatives completed a cross-sectional questionnaire at baseline and 3-year follow-up. Results. A factor analysis of this self-report instrument produced a two-factor solution. The resulting health and safety climate scales had good internal consistency (Cronbach's α = 0.74 and 0.82, respectively) and concurrent validity. The health climate scale was correlated more highly with organizational measures that were indicative of a supportive health climate than those indicating supportive safety climate, while the reverse was true of the safety climate scale. Changes in health climate were associated with the number of smoking and smokeless tobacco programs offered at the worksites at the time of the 3-year follow-up (r = 0.46 and 0.42, respectively). The scales were not correlated with most employee health behaviors. The health climate scores increased at intervention worksites, compared with scores at control worksites (F[1,36] = 7.57, P = 0.009). Conclusions. The health and safety climate scales developed for this study provide useful instruments for measuring organizational change related to worksite health promotion activities. The Working Well Intervention resulted in a significant improvement in worksite health climate.","Cancer prevention; Organizational climate; Scale development; Validity; Worksite health promotion","adult; article; cancer prevention; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; electronics industry; employee; female; follow up; health behavior; health promotion; human; major clinical study; male; multicenter study; occupational safety; organization; pipeline; priority journal; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; self report; smoking cessation; United States; work environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031879192

Enhanced sequestration of atmospheric CO2 in the soil, ultimately as stable humus, may well prove a more lasting solution than (temporarily) sequestering CO2 in the standing biomass through reforestation and afforestation. Such actions will also help to reverse processes of land degradation, thus contributing to sustained food productivity and security for the people in the regions concerned.","Carbon dioxide; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Greenhouse gases; Mitigation options","afforestation; agriculture; carbon dioxide; climate; reforestation; sequestration; soil degradation; soil; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; soil carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031877835

To analyze this phenomenon, the Poisson equation was solved numerically for a spherical vacuum diode with a field emission cathode. The dependence of the actual electric field on the geometric electric field has been compared with the known approximate dependencies. Strong screening of the electric field at the cathode by the space charge of emitted electrons at fields over 5×107 V/cm is noted. Based on the obtained dependencies of the actual field on the geometric one and using the SuperSAM code, the field emission occurring in a Muller projector has been simulated. It has been shown that the `ring effect' appearing in field emission patterns can well be explained by the field emission from the peripheral regions of the field emitter.

A high-resolution, multilevel, primitive equation ocean model is used to examine this eddy development in an idealized way, by considering the development of flow from rest when temperatures are initially given the observed longshore gradients. The system is allowed to geostrophically adjust in the absence of longshore winds and of any surface heat flux. Two types of experiments are conducted. The first type uses the Indian Ocean climatological temperature gradient forcing (case 1 and 2), while the second type repeats the first experiment with the added contribution of the North West Shelf (NWS) temperature profile (cases 3 and 4). To investigate the additional effects of coastline irregularities, cases 1 and 3 use an ideal coastline, while cases 2 and 4 use an irregular (realistic) coastline. In all cases, maximum surface velocities occur at Cape Leeuwin, where the Leeuwin Current changes direction, and off Southern Australia. Maximum undercurrent velocities occur off Western Australia. In case 1, Cape Leeuwin and the Western Australian coast are the preferred locations for the development of warm, anticyclonic eddies, which are generated due to a mixed instability mechanism. In case 2, the warm, anticyclonic eddies occur in the vicinity of coastal promontories and at Cape Leeuwin. While advection of warm water is present along the entire coast in case 1, the irregular coastline geometry limits the extent of warm water in case 2. The added contribution from the NWS water in cases 3 and 4 augments the onshore geostrophic inflow to produce a model Leeuwin Current and undercurrent that are more vigorous and unstable than in the previous cases. In case 3, the NWS water adds strong horizontal shear to the coastal equatorial region of the domain and vertical shear to the inshore current. It also advects warmer water along the entire coast. In case 4, the addition of both the NWS water and the irregular coastline results in the establishment of a stronger surface current and undercurrent than in the previous cases; however, the irregular coastline limits the extent of the advection of the NWS warmer water along the Australian coast. In all cases, warm, anticyclonic eddies develop at the coast. Cold, cyclonic eddies form from the limbs of the established warm, anticyclonic eddies with the result that two counterrotating cells are developed. Once the eddy pairs begin their westward propagation, the Leeuwin Current intensifies as nonlinear effects result in a jet between the eddies and the coast. These effects translate downstream to augment the current velocities at the coast, which, due to a mixed instability mechanism, result in the development of new anticyclonic eddies at the coast. The results from case 4, which has the most realistic features, highlights the major characteristics of the Leeuwin Current and agrees well with available observations. These results show that the model successfully captures the qualitative nature of the nonlinear, eddying response of the Leeuwin Current.",,"circulation modeling; coastal current; eastern boundary current; eddy; Australia; Indian Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0033056616

In the early years, states were given virtually complete discretion to plan their air pollution control strategy. Unfortunately, very few of these plans were successful. Under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, control measures were federally prescribed based on the severity of an area's air quality problem. Still today, over seven years later, many areas remain out of attainment. This paper summarizes the work of stakeholders brought together as a part of the FACA Subcommittee for Ozone, Particulate Matter, and Regional Haze Implementation Programs to examine the relative merits of federal prescription versus state discretion in the development of attainment plans. The group concluded its work in November 1997, with a two part recommendation. The group recommended that states should be given complete discretion in the development of an attainment plan tailored to address an area's specific needs, provided that the plan include backstops, in the form of pre-adopted contingency measures, to ensure timely attainment should the plan prove to be deficient.",,"Air quality; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Standards; Strategic planning; Federal prescription; State discretion; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032285317

Many European nations reduced their SO2 emissions by using desulfurization units in power plants, changing the fuels used in domestic heating from coal to low sulfur oil or gas, and reducing the sulfur content of petrol. All these measures have to be implemented in Turkey to effectively reduce SO2 emissions. The existence of mountain and slope wind systems had an essential purifying effect on polluted areas and should be preserved by city planning.

Genetic diversity plays a critical role in the survival of populations in rapidly changing environments. Furthermore, most tropical plant species are known to have unique ecological niches, and therefore changes in climate may directly affect the distribution of biomes, ecosystems, and constituent species. Climate change may also indirectly affect plant genetic resources through effects on phenology, breeding systems, and plant-pollinator and plant seed disperser interactions, and may reduce genetic diversity and reproductive output. As a consequence, population densities may be reduced leading to reduction in genetic diversity through genetic drift and inbreeding. Tropical forest plants may respond to climate change through phenotypic plasticity, adaptive evolution, migration to suitable site, or extinction. However, the potential to respond is limited by a rapid pace of change and the non-availability of alternate habitats due to past and present trends of deforestation. Thus climate change may result in extinction of many populations and species. Our ability to estimate the precise response of tropical forest ecosystems to climate change is limited by lack of long-term data on parameters that might be affected by climate change. Collection of correlative data from long-term monitoring of climate as well as population and community responses at selected sites offer the most cost-effective way to understand the effects of climate change on tropical tree populations. However, mitigation strategies need to be implemented immediately. Because many effects of climate change may be similar to the effects of habitat alteration and fragmentation, protected areas and buffer zones should be enlarged, with an emphasis on connectivity among conserved landscapes. Taxa that are likely to become extinct should be identified and protected through ex situ conservation programs.",,"climate change; genetic resource; tree; tropical forest",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031829568

Immersion of the (Fe(III))-Mb-doped electrode into aqueous solutions of NO results in a bulk chemical reductive nitrosylation forming NO-Mb-Fe(II), as indicated by the dissappearance of the Fe(III/II)- Mb couple in voltammograms. At more negative potentials, a catalytic reduction wave appears at ca. -0.7 V/SCE, which remains catalytic in solutions from pH 5.5 to pH 10 and is NO-concentration dependent.

The two known ways of HCO, utilization are (a) via extracellular, carbonic anhydrase catalyzed dehydration of HCO3− to form CO2, which then diffuses into the photosynthesizing cells, and (b) by direct uptake via a transporter. While the first way may be sufficient to support low rates of photosynthesis in temperate regions, it is viewed as futile under situations where high temperatures and irradiances would cause a high pH to form close to the uptake site of carbon and where, consequently, the CO2/HCO3− ratio would be very low.

The basins represent about 76% of the Baltic Sea catchment area of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. The population living in the basins causes point emissions of 1752 tN/a and 293 tP/a. The analysis of diffuse emissions of nutrients is based on digitized maps of the land use and the soil types, the livestock numbers in the basins and measurements on the nutrient concentrations in the groundwater and drainage areas. The used method considers different pathways of diffuse sources as load from urban areas, erosion, load by groundwater, and drainage systems, atmospheric deposition, and direct load by agricultural activities. The dominant pathway of nitrogen emissions is the emissions of drainage. For phosphorus the emissions by erosion, groundwater and drainage are the main sources. The emissions of point sources contribute to the total emissions to 10% (N) and 25% (P), respectively. The measured nutrient load at the monitoring stations of the rivers is in all cases lower than the sum of the nutrient emissions. This behaviour can be explained by intensive retention processes in the rivers, which depends on the specific runoff, and for nitrogen additionally on the area of surface water in the basin. Measures against the high nutrient load have to be focussed on the reduction of diffuse sources, especially the emissions of nitrogen and phosphorus by drainage systems have to be reduced, and additionally in the case of phosphorus the emissions by erosion and by direct agricultural load.","Diffuse pathways; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Point emission; Retention; River basin; Source apportionment","Drainage; Erosion; Groundwater; Land use; Nitrogen; Rivers; Soils; Surface waters; Baltic Sea; Diffuse load; Diffuse pathways; Nutrients; Point emission; Source apportionment; River basin projects; ground water; nitrogen; phosphorus; runoff; nitrogen; phosphorus; river basin; river pollution; agriculture; conference paper; environmental monitoring; German Democratic Republic; land use; river; soil; urban area; water pollution; Germany; Mecklenburg-Vorpommern",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031798334

It was applied for after the German reunification in 1990 and first investigations started shortly thereafter. The main investigations took place during the years 1993 to 1995. The Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research was responsible for co-ordinating the activities of the ecological investigations within this programme. Furthermore, the modelling of ecological impacts was executed by PIK scientists on the basis of ecological investigations, mainly executed by the Centre of Agricultural Landscape and Land Use Science (ZALF), and the Technical University in Cittbus (BTUC). The modelling task included the representation of physical, chemical and physiological processes in Scots Pine (Pinus sylv. L.) forests as well as the extrapolation of the results to the regional level, considering different air pollution and climate scenarios. This report includes the final project results of the two groups at PIK, involved in the project: Firstly, the newly developed physiological-based forest growth model FORSANA was applied for the first time to three pine stands, which differed largely in their air pollution and deposition history. (The evaluation of the model is presented in PIK Report 32). The model was able to explain the growth during the last decades of at least two of the three stands from the climatic and deposition conditions at the sites. The third site was shown to be exceptional with respect to its relation between dimension and age, and was supposed to be exposed to major disturbances in the past, which could not be accounted for by the model. To extrapolate from the stand level to the regional level, FORSANA was initialised with spatially explicit data from forestry inventory and soil maps. Simulations were executed with measured weather records and regional distributions of deposition and air pollution, which were estimated on the basis of emission inventories and wind directions. Different assumptions about the development of air pollution had been applied to investigate different pollution abatement strategies. The results showed that a positive effect can be expected from the actual emission reductions close the main centres of emission, but showed also that this effect is decreasing with increasing distance from the emission source. Two additional papers are presented in this report, to give a more detailed insight in the history and aims of the joint project, and to present an overview of the integrated results of the ecological investigations.

The ratio between the ionization cross sections of A and B electronic states was also measured. These A and B states were respectively favoured in the orthogonal and collinear approaches. Our results showed that, when the system switched from the orthogonal to the collinear direction, the attractive character of the He*-CO2 system was increased and the Penning ionization cross section became larger.

Restricted Hartree Fock ab initia calculations at the 6-31G level for diphenyl carbonate (DPC), a key model compound of bisphenol-A polycarbonate, reveal two inequivalent trans-trans carbonate-ring conformations both of which will exist in solution, melt or glassy states. These calculations appear to be the first high level ones (with full geometry optimization) reported for DPC, and the findings are consistent with earlier ab initia results for phenyl formate and other smaller model compounds and also with single-crystal X-ray data for DPC and oligomers. In addition to a transIrans conformer of DPC with both phenyl rings on the same side of the carbonate unit (called the 'syn' conformer) which is seen in the crystalline state of DPC, an 'anti' conformer of lower energy is found, which has its two phenyl rings located on opposite sides of the plane of the carbonate unit. Analysis of these calculated ground state geometries and energies as well as experimental single crystal X-ray results indicates that the 'anti' conformer has the lowest energy in the gas phase and solution, while the 'syn' conformation is stabilized relative to the 'anti' in the bulk, probably because of aromatic ring interactions between neighbour chain segments. In the glassy state of either DPC or polycarbonate, one expects a nearly random mixture of 'syn/anti' conformers, and the prominent low-temperature mechanical loss peak observed in many polycarbonates is consistent with a molecular level two-state process consisting of 'syn/ anti' carbonate conformer conversions. These conformational transitions must involve rotation and translation of both the carbonate units and, most importantly, the neighbouring phenyl groups. The possible influence of these conformational changes and the accompanying correlated molecular motions on polymer ductility and ageing is briefly discussed. ©1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

RCP Phase VI is the multidisciplinary, 4-D, 3-C study of a CO2 injection project in Vacuum field, a shallow shelf carbonate reservoir located on the Northwestern Shelf of the Permian Basin of West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico. The CO2 ""huff-n-puff"" in well Texaco CVU-97 at Vacuum Field and the repeated 3-D, 3-C seismic surveys were performed from October 30, 1995 to December 27, 1995. The initial 3-D, 3-C survey was acquired from October 28 through November 13. CO2 injection began November 13, 1995 and lasted until December 8, 1995. The ""soak"" period extended from December 8 through December 28, after which Texaco CVU-97 was returned to production. The second 3-D, 3-C survey was acquired during the ""soak"" period, from December 21 to December 28. The compressional data provides a measure of the bulk rock compressibility, rigidity and density, while shear wave data is sensitive to rigidity and density. The combined use of P-wave, S1 shear and S2 shear seismic data allow different views of the bulk rock properties in the subsurface. Our interpretation methodology strives to use these volumes to delineate spatial variations in the subsurface related to lithology, porosity, pore structure variations related to preferred permeability directions, and variations in pore fluid pressure and properties. Interval traveltime comparisons between the P- and shear volumes are a robust and sensitive indicator of lithology, porosity and pore geometry, and the intensity of fracturing. In particular, the Tsi/TP and TS2/Tp measures show regions of lower Vp/Vs ratio in the southwest portion of the survey area. This portion of the reservoir produces less fluid with a lower water cut than do areas of the field exhibiting a higher Vp/Vs ratio. The Vp/Vs measure appears strongly correlated with the reservoir production characteristics. Anomalies between the two seismic surveys are readily visible on both the P-wave and S-wave seismic surveys. These anomalies arise in P-wave amplitude difference maps and variations in S-wave velocity anisotropy. An interpretation of these 4-D, 3-C seismic anomalies indicates that a CO2 miscible bank formed south of well CVU-97 near well CVU-200, and that the bank is contained by a permeability barrier near well CVU-200. P-wave and S1 shear data are delineating reservoir zones where fluid compressibility and/or viscosity have changed due to CO2 injection and the subsequent migration of lighter hydrocarbons. The ability to sense bulk rock/fluid properties with 4-D, 3-C seismology enables characterization of the most important transport property of a reservoir, namely permeability. Because of the high volume resolution of the 4-D, 3-C seismic, we can monitor the sweep efficiency of a production process to see if reserves are bypassed by channeling around lower permeability parts of the reservoir and the rate at which the channeling occurs. In doing so, we can change production processes to sweep the reservoir more efficiently. © Copyright 1998, Society of Petroleum Engineers, Inc.",,"Carbon dioxide; Compressibility; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Geological surveys; Hydrocarbons; Lithology; Pore structure; Porosity; Rigidity; Seismic waves; Seismology; Shear flow; Shear waves; Tellurium compounds; Wave propagation; Carbon dioxide; Compressibility of solids; Density (specific gravity); Mechanical permeability; Rigidity; Rocks; Seismic waves; Seismology; Fluid compressibility; Hydrocarbon recovery; Permeability barriers; Production characteristics; Reservoir characterization; Reservoir performance; Structure variation; Time lapse seismic monitoring; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petroleum reservoirs; Carbon dioxide injection; Sweep efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031643909

The critical frequency (upper limit of the emission) strongly depends on the Lorentz factor of the expansion. We have searched for simultaneous radio emission in the data of solar radio spectrographs at times when BATSE reported a non-solar gamma-ray burst (GRB) within the beams of the radio telescopes. Solar spectrographs are less sensitive than single frequency receivers, but yield a broad overview on the spectrum ideal for discriminating against atmospheric and man-made interference. In 7 well-observed cases no radio emission was found. This puts upper and lower limits on the Lorentz factor of the fireball expansion in GRBs if the source distance is less than 1 kpc, i.e. if GRBs are local.

To investigate the combined influence of litter quality and climate, data were used from 37 sites and plots at which root litters of three coniferous species (Pinus sylvestris, Pinus contorta and Picea abies) had been incubated. In spite of the considerable climatic differences among sites, there were no strong relationships between any climatic variable and the lst-yr mass loss (range 17.0–40.9%). For the lst-yr mass loss, the average annual temperature was the most rate-regulating factor for all litter combined, with a value for R 2adj of 0.186. Substrate quality also had an influence. Thus, for the whole region lignin concentration was significant, with a value for R 2adj of 0.142. For the separated groups of pine and spruce stands the value for r 2 increased but the factor average temperature still dominated and for pine the R 2adj reached a value of 0.346. Over the region N concentration in the fresh pine root litter was significant (R2adj = 0.232). For the root litter of P. abies the average temperature in July was the strongest rate-regulating climatic factor, with a value for R 2adj of 0.381. A combination of temperature in July and the initial P concentration in the litter gave an R 2adj value of 0.713 for P. abies litter, thus explaining about 71% of the variation. © 1998 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Climate; Decomposition; Lignin; Nitrogen.

The samples from the upper layers of sedge fen communities had the highest potential for methane production, samples from the upper layers of S. majus having about 70% and other samples 10-20% of this maximal potential. Methane production from the upper peat layers was substrate-limited in all three plant communities. The rate of methane production increased in samples from the carpet and mesotrophic fen when both substrate concentration and temperature were increased simultaneously. Variation of pH did not affect samples from the sedge fen, but methane production increased in samples from the S. majus carpet, and decreased in samples from the S. fuscum hummock when the pH was raised. Our results imply that the effects of temperature on methane production under field conditions are constrained by substrate limitation.

U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) efforts to implement this policy will be described. A secondary objective of this paper is to discuss from a U.S. perspective the social and political efforts which must be initiated in order for ocean storage of CO2 to be considered as a viable CO2 mitigation option. The fact that the Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) has not been successful in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is now recognized. Thus, U.S. policy has shifted towards the development of binding medium-term emissions targets and long-term atmosphere concentration goals. The U.S. believes these goals can be accomplished through the adoption of cost-effective joint implementation agreements and international emissions trading mechanisms. Studies are currently underway to assess specific targets and timetables for emissions reductions. Voluntary efforts on the part of U.S. industry have proven to be extremely successful in reducing U.S. CO2 emissions. The U.S. electric utility industry has taken the lead in voluntarily lowering greenhouse gas emissions under the DOE Climate Challenge Program. As of August, 1996, nearly 600 utility participants, accounting for over 60% of electric power generation in the U.S. have joined the program. Areas of research interest to DOE include the development of high efficiency advanced power generation cycles and CO2 sequestration technology. The U.S. currently spends $1.6 billion on understanding global climate phenomena and only $1.6 million on CO2 mitigation research. A number of socio-political considarations must be looked at in assessing the feasibility of ocean storage of CO2. Developing public trust appears to be a major concern in establishing the acceptability of ocean storage. Uncertainties in the effects of CO2 on marine life, potential safety hazards associated with pipelining, and ship transport of CO2 are all issues which must be dealt with as soon as possible.

It is generally thought that tension plays a major pathophysiologic role. These proliferative scars are characterized by increased collagen arid glycosaminoglycan content, as well as increase collagen turnover. The therapeutic management of hypertrophic scars and keloids includes occlusive dressings, compression therapy, intralesional corticosteroid injections, cryosurgery, excision, radiation therapy, laser therapy, interferon therapy and other promising, lesser known therapies directed at collagen synthesis. Although the most commonly used occlusive dressings include silicone based materials, the anti-keloidal effect is the result of the occlusion and hydration effected rather than the silicone itself. Pressure devices, through local tissue hypoxia, have proven effective in reducing scar height. Intralesional steroids decrease the connective tissue components and scar volume. Post-operative steroid injections reduce keloid recurrence to less than 50%. Cryosurgery is most effective when combined with intralesional corticosteroids. Excision only of hypertrophic scars and keloids results in 45-100% recurrence. Radiation therapy, using various protocols, has been a safe and efficacious modality in reducing recurrence. The CO2, Nd:YAG, and Argon lasers have been used as destructive modalities for the treatment of proliferative scarring. The pulsed-dye laser offers symptomatic improvement and reduces the erythema associated with these scars. Intralesional interferon -γ and -α 2(b) have been used successfully to decrease scar height and reduce the number of post- operative recurrences.","Carbon dioxide laser; Corticosteroids; Hypertrophic scars; Interferon; Keloids; Laser therapy; Pulsed-dye laser; Radiotherapy; Scarring; Silicone sheeting","azetidine derivative; carboxylic acid derivative; corticosteroid; decorin; dexamethasone; gamma interferon; hydroxyproline; pentoxifylline; proline; silicone; tranilast; transforming growth factor beta; carbon dioxide laser; compression therapy; continuing education; corticosteroid therapy; cryosurgery; excision; human; hypertrophic scar; immunotherapy; interstitial radiation; intralesional drug administration; keloid; laser surgery; pulsed dye laser; review; scar formation; wound dressing; Adrenal Cortex Hormones; Cicatrix, Hypertrophic; Combined Modality Therapy; Female; Humans; Keloid; Male; Prognosis; Radiotherapy; Surgical Procedures, Operative",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032410066

This analysis combined the use of polarographic, steady-state voltammetric, cyclic voltammetric, and spectroelectrochemical methods. Iron(III) 2,7,12,17-tetran-propylporphycene ([FeIIITPrPn]Cl) is reduced in three one-electron steps and is oxidized in two one-electron steps: All the processes are reversible. The corresponding iron μ-oxo dimer [FeIIITPrPn](N-MeIm)2+O undergoes four one-electron oxidations as well as four one-electron reductions. [FeIIITPrPn]Cl forms a stable [FeIIITPrPn](N-MeIm, the iron (II) complex in the presence of N-MeIm.

In the presence of CO, the reduction of iron(III) generates [FeII(CO)TPrPn]. In contrast to porphyrins, one- and two-electron reductions of the latter compound are shifted to more negative potentials in DMF and THF and these electron transfers remain reversible.

This innovation path also aims to promote environmental quality, particularly by reducing emissions of criteria air pollutants, to reduce U.S. dependence on imported oil, and to induce technological innovation and diffusion in energy production and consumption. The innovation path would reduce economy-wide carbon emissions by 26% below baseline projections for 2010 and by 62% below baseline projections for 2030; this translates into 10% below 1990 levels in 2010 and 45% below 1990 levels in 2030. Emissions of criteria pollutants also would be significantly reduced, as would petroleum imports by the United States. Moreover, the innovation path would yield cumulative net savings for the United States of $218 billion (1993 dollars) through 2010, or $19 billion on a leveled annual basis, and would result in 800,000 additional jobs nationwide by 2010. Although the overall findings from the innovation path analysis are robust, the results should be taken as indicative, rather than precisely predictive, owing to uncertainties in future costs, prices, technology performance, and consumer behavior.

Stomatal conductance was significantly lower in most of the species collected in the CO2 spring and this indicated that CO2 effects on gs are not of a transitory nature but persist in the long term and through plant generations. Such a decrease was, however, not associated with changes in the anatomy of leaves: SD was unaffected in the majority of species (the decrease was only significant in three out of the 17 species examined), and also SI values did not vary between the two sites with the exception of two species that showed increased SI in plants grown in the CO2-enriched area.

Cryorthents, Cryaquepts and Haplocryods are the main soil units observed. The organic matter accumulation in mineral soils of the ice-free coastal Antarctic region is similar to that of comparable Arctic regions. A small-distance storage variation is mainly due to the patch pattern of topography, geomorphology and especially soil geography. Haplocryods are important sinks of carbon and nitrogen, whereas the storage in the Cryaquepts is of minor importance. In addition, large parts of the landscape are characterized by Lithic Cryorthents, which store nearly 50% of the organic carbon and 40% of the nitrogen. A high variability in the C and N concentration and storage complicates a calculation of soil C and N storage of the total landscape necessary for developing ecosystem models. However, the survey on landscape level suggests that in 75% of the landscape sites the soil carbon and nitrogen stock is very similar, but a wide-spread podzolization and/or extraordinary organic matter accumulation increases the stocks to a great extent. For this reason a storage estimation could be improved by a proper soil survey. © WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH, 1998.","Antarctica; Soil carbon; Soil nitrogen; Soil pattern; Terrestrial ecosystems",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0004846037

A comprehensive mathematical model is next developed to quantify the total equivalent warming impact (TEWI) of the automotive air conditioning. Using this model, intensive calculations are performed to determine the TEWI of the present R-134a air conditioning system as well as the proposed alternate systems. The calculated results indicate that TEWI of the present R-134a system is higher than those of the flammable subcritical systems (R-152a, R-290 and R-717) but lower than those of the supercritical carbon dioxide system (R-744) and open air (R-729) cycle system. The calculated results show that TEWI of 303 million R-134a automotive air conditioning systems in the worldwide fleet is no more than 0.14% of TEWI of the greenhouse gases emitted annually into Earth's atmosphere due to human activity. According to the TEWI reduction cost estimates developed by the Council of Economic Advisers to the U. S. President, the cost of eliminating automotive air conditioning TEWI should not exceed $12.60 per system over its life span of 12 years. Taking cognizance of the miniscule contribution of automotive air conditioning to the global emissions and the acceptable cost to eliminate them, it is concluded that the most felicitous and cost effective solution to deal with the automotive air conditioning TEWI is to continue to improve the existing R-134a system through reduction of the refrigerant emissions and enhancement of the overall system efficiency. ©1998 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cost estimating; Cost reduction; Earth atmosphere; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Polyols; Supercritical fluid extraction; Automotive air conditioning; Automotive air-conditioning systems; Cost-effective solutions; Global warming impact; Refrigerant emissions; Subcritical systems; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Total equivalent warming impacts; Air conditioning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072450005

China is the largest emitter of coal mine methane, followed by the Commonwealth of Independent States, or CIS (particularly Russia, Ukraine and Kazakhstan), the United States, Poland, Germany, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Australia, India and the Czech Republic. Most of these countries use a portion of the methane that is liberated from their coal mines, but the utilization rate tends to be low and some countries use none at all. Coal mine methane is currently used for a variety of purposes. Methane is used for heating and cooking at many mine facilities and nearby residences. It is also used to fuel boilers, to generate electricity, directly heat air for mine ventilation systems and for coal drying. Several mines in the United states sell high-quality mine gas to natural gas distributors. There are several barriers to decreasing methane emissions by increasing coal mine methane use. Many of the same barriers are common to a number of the subject countries. Technical barriers include low-permeability coals, variable or low gas quality, variations in gas supply and demand and lack of infrastructure. Economic and institutional barriers include lack of information pertinent to development of the resource, lack of capital and low natural gas prices.

Using steady state, transient kinetic measurements and physico-chemical characterization techniques have shown that the catalyst activity is determined by the available Pt-ZrO2 perimeter. Methane is decomposed on the metal to CHx (average value of x = 2) and H2. The main route to CO2 reduction occurs via initial formation of carbonate close to the metal-support boundary. Carbon on the metal reduces that carbonate to formate by forming CO. The formate decomposes rapidly to CO and a surface hydroxyl group. Hydroxyl groups recombine and form water or react further with methane to CO and hydrogen (steam reforming). When the rate of methane decomposition and carbonate reduction are in balance, the catalytic activity remains stable.

It is recognized within the automotive industry that any catalyst, either diesel or gasoline, is unable to function efficiently when it is cold. The two way oxidation diesel catalyst is unable to oxidize CO to CO2 and unburned hydrocarbons (uHCs) to CO2 and H 2O, due to low start up exhaust temperatures. Add to this the inherently lower temperature of diesel exhaust, and it is possible that during urban driving the catalyst can take up to 10 minutes before receiving sufficient energy to start oxidizing the exhaust efficiently. Work carried out at the University of Central England (UCE) suggests that although the catalyst is unable to oxidize CO and uHCs emissions during start and warm up, it has a secondary function of trapping the particulates produced, and reduce the tailpipe particulate emissions during the engine warm up phase.

The magnitudes of both the maximum shift in emission spectrum and reduction in fluorescence intensity were dependent on the α-glucan ligands used. Maximum K(d) for a range of linear malto-oligosaccharides analysed was 0.13 mM as found at a degree of polymerisation (DP) of 13. Large differences in dissociation constants were measured for CDs with DP 6 (α-CD, 6.0 mM), DP 7 (β-CD, 0.25 mM) and DP 8 (γ-CD, 0.67 μM). The high-molecular-mass α-glucans amylose and amylopectin, both substrates for PSBE-I, showed apparent affinities of 0.018 and 0.066 mg/ml, respectively. Small linear and cyclic oligosaccharides competed with amylopectin in the affinity electrophoresis system and they were also competitive inhibitors for PSBE-I activity. The affinities for oligosaccharides as measured by competition were, however, about 10-fold lower than as measured by fluorescence quenching suggesting the existence of a separate oligosaccharide binding site on PSBE-I. Affinity electrophoresis revealed multiform heterogeneity in the enzyme preparation with respect to α-glucan interaction.","Affinity electrophoresis; Fluorescence quenching; Starch; Starch-branching enzyme; Substrate binding","amylopectin; amylose; cyclodextrin; glucan; oligosaccharide; starch; article; binding site; competitive inhibition; controlled study; dissociation constant; electrophoresis; enzyme activity; enzyme binding; enzyme isolation; enzyme kinetics; enzyme substrate complex; fluorescence; nonhuman; potato; priority journal; 1,4-alpha-Glucan Branching Enzyme; Amylopectin; Amylose; Binding Sites; Binding, Competitive; Cyclodextrins; Glucans; Kinetics; Oligosaccharides; Plant Proteins; Protein Binding; Solanum tuberosum; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Tryptophan; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032031486

This paper examines the potential for carbon sequestration projects in the Panama Canal Watershed, an area with increasingly fragile forest ecosystems. The maintenance of forests in the Watershed has economic and ecological value for operating the Canal, providing drinking water to Panama City, and protecting wildlife habitat and diversity. Land conversion to agriculture and pasture has led to widespread deforestation; predicted population growth threatens the Watershed further. Compounding the problem is the lack of funding for protected areas in the Canal Watershed Area. Carbon sequestration projects are being promoted as an economically efficient way to reduce harmful greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and increase forest cover in developing countries. Forests, acting as sinks for carbon, can reduce emissions produced elsewhere. Many concerns have been raised by developing countries, and uncertainties relating to carbon storage and carbon trading remain to be resolved. Despite these drawbacks, carbon sequestration projects offer an economically attractive strategy for furthering Panama's goals of protecting and expanding forest cover in the Watershed. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The Council of Ministers of the EU have defined a range of common and coordinated policies and measures that can help in reaching this target. Important policies to reduce emissions of carbon dioxide turn out to be renewable energy programmes, the stimulation of combined generation of heat and power, measures to support the use of more efficient appliances, voluntary agreements in heavy industry, and carbon dioxide emission standards for passenger cars. Instead of a 9% growth of CO2 emissions in a business-as-usual scenario from 1990 to 2010 a reduction of 5-15% is possible. Also for other greenhouse gases there is room for policies and measures to reduce emissions. We conclude that the targets for the EU are feasible, but that substantial policy development is still necessary to attain these targets.",,"Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Public policy; Renewable energy resources; Climate policy; Greenhouse gases; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032271536

These findings are highly significant for people living in the Great Lakes basin (and particularly the Windsor-Quebec corridor), where high levels of certain air pollutants (eg, ground-level ozone and ultra-fine particles) occur more frequently than in other parts of Canada. The issue is a serious one, requiring an integrated and comprehensive approach by many stakeholders, including the active involvement of organized medicine. It is important that the health effects of these air pollutants are understood. Governments must act to reduce emission levels through statue and regulation bolstered by noncompliance penalties. The findings of research have included the following: in a Toronto study, a 2% to 4% excess of respiratory deaths were attributable to pollutant levels; children living in rural Ontario communities with the highest levels of airborne acids were significantly more likely to report at least one episode of bronchitis, as well as to show decreases in lung function; and have been linked to increases in pollutants, emergency room visits and hospitalizations in Ontario. Every Ontarian is affected by air pollutants, although he or she may be unaware of the asymptomatic effects such as lung and bronchial inflammation. This health problem is preventable; while physicians know of the adverse health impacts of air pollution and they are concerned, individually they now focus on the treatment of symptoms. The major recommendations of the report are as follows: Enactment of more stringent sulphur and nitrogen oxide emission limits, including a provincewide sulphur dioxide reduction of 75% from current cap levels, and the maximum allowable nitrogen oxides emission limits of 6000 tonnes annually from Ontario Hydro. New transportation sector emission limits that should include California-level standards for light and heavy duty vehicles, reductions from off-road engines, an expanded vehicle inspection and maintenance program, and tougher standards for sulphur-in-fuel content. Petitioning the United States Environmental Protection Agency administrator under Section 115 of the United States Clear Air Act to require reductions in the American emission of sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which damage the health of Canadian residents and their environment. Physician advice to patients about the risks of smog exposure, physician support for more health effects research on air pollution, and physician promotion of the development of air pollution-related health education materials. The recommendations discussed in this paper will, if acted upon, lead to a significant reduction in the overall burden of illness from air pollutants, especially in children and the elderly. These recommendations have been selected from a review of recommendations made by various authorities, and are those that the OMA feels a particular responsibility to support.","Epidemiology; Health effects/impacts; Health policy; Outdoor air pollution; Risk groups; Sensitive subgroups; Smog; Tropospheric ozone","acid; nitrogen oxide; ozone; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; aerosol; air pollution; bronchitis; Canada; emergency ward; exhaust gas; government; health; health education; hospitalization; inflammation; law; lung function; mortality; particulate matter; priority journal; respiratory tract disease; review; rural area",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031774805

Results showed that most of the 55 lakes, mainly located in the north, are sensitive to acidification, 87% and 33% of them having alkalinity values of below 200 and 20 μeq l-1, respectively. The main processes determining water chemistry were carbonate and silicate weathering depending on the geo-lithology of the watershed, while the input of atmospheric deposition was a source of variability for nitrogen and chloride. A comparison between the critical and present loads of acidity to the lakes showed that a reduction of more than 50% of the acidifying compounds would be required to keep a safe level of alkalinity in all the lakes. Ammonium plays an important role in acidification processes and must be considered in the reduction of emissions.","Acification; Alpine lakes; Critical loads; Hydrochemistry; Trends","acidification; alpine environment; atmospheric deposition; lake; water chemistry; Switzerland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031796101

Attention has focused in particular on use of methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE, CAS #1634-04-4) and, despite considerable published research, debate persists regarding its potential for adverse health effects. To better understand the debate, we critically reviewed published and unpublished reports to assess whether differences in methodological approach or quality could explain the variable results reported. We considered studies on acute human health effects of inhalation exposure to MTBE either alone or in gasoline (19 reports) as well as clinical use of parenteral MTBE to dissolve cholesterol gall stones (12 reports). Each study was reviewed from three perspectives (epidemiology, industrial hygiene, and, clinical diagnostics), judged satisfactory, limited adequacy, or unsatisfactory for each criterion, and grouped into one of three categories from most to least adequate in overall methodology. The studies judged most adequate on individual criteria and those with highest overall adequacy found no significant association between MTBE exposure and symptoms. We propose that the persistent debate has been fueled by the findings of methodologically weak hypothesis-generating studies. © 1998 by ASP.","CAS #1634-04-4; Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990; Methyl tert-butyl ether; MTBE; Oxygenated fuel; Oxygenated fuel program; Reformulated gasoline",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-26444499679

The Chicago Air Shower Array (CASA), operating in coincidence with the Michigan muon array (MIA), has recorded over 2.2 x 109 air showers from 1990 April 4 to 1995 October 7. We search for gamma rays based upon the muon content of air showers arriving from the direction of the Galactic plane. We find no significant evidence for diffuse gamma-ray emission, and we set an upper limit on the ratio of gamma rays to normal hadronic cosmic rays at less than 2.4 x 10-5 at 310 TeV (90% confidence limit) from the Galactic plane region: (50°&lt;l &lt; 200° ; -5° &lt; b &lt; 5°). This limit places a strong constraint on models for emission from molecular clouds in the Galaxy. We rule out significant spectral hardening in the outer Galaxy, and conclude that emission from the plane at these energies is likely to be dominated by the decay of neutral pions resulting from cosmic-ray interactions with passive target gas molecules. © 1998.

Physiological, anatomical and biochemical measurements were used to relate changes in the activities/amounts of key enzymes of C3 and C4 carboxylation to physiological performance under severe drought stress. On the basis of gas-exchange measurements and day/night patterns of organic acid turnover, the species were categorised as weak CAM-inducible (C. aripoensis Britt.), C3-CAM intermediate (C. minor L.) and constitutive CAM (C. rosea Jacq. 9.). The categories reflect genotypic differences in physiological response to drought stress in terms of net carbon gain; in C. aripoensis net carbon gain was reduced by over 80% in drought-stressed plants whilst carbon gain was relatively unaffected after 10 d without water in C. rosea. In turn, genotypic differences in the capacity for CAM appeared to be directly related to the capacities/amounts of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPCase) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) which increased in response to drought in both young and mature leaves. Whilst measured activities of PEPCase and PEPCK in well-watered plants of the C3-CAM intermediate C. minor were 5-10 times in excess of that required to support the magnitude of organic acid turnover induced by drought, close correlations were observed between malate accumulation/PEPCase capacity and citrate decarboxylation/PEPCK capacity in all the species. Drought stress did not affect the amount of ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) protein in any of the species but Rubisco activity was reduced by 35% in the weak CAM-inducible C. aripoensis. Similar amounts of glycine decarboxylase (GDC) protein were present in all three species regardless of the magnitude of CAM expression. Thus, the constitutive CAM species C. rosea did not appear to show reduced activity of this key enzyme of the photorespiratory pathway, which, in turn, may be related to the low internal conductance to CO2 in this succulent species. Immuno-histochemical techniques showed that PEPCase, PEPCK and Rubisco were present in cells of the palisade and spongy parenchyma in leaves of species performing CAM. However, in leaves from well-watered plants of C. aripoensis which only performed C3 photosynthesis, PEPCK was localized around latex-producing ducts. Differences in leaf anatomy between the species suggest that the association between mesophyll succulence and the 'capacity for CAM in these hemi-epiphytic stranglers has been selected for in arid environments.","Clusia; Crassulacean acid metabolism; Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase; Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; Ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase","acid metabolism; carboxylation; citric acid; decarboxylation; drought; gas exchange; genotype; glycine decarboxylase; habitat; Immunohistochemistry; latex; malic acid; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (gtp); phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; photorespiration; photosynthetic plasticity; ribulose 1,5 biphosphate carboxylase; ribulose 1,5 biphosphate oxygenase; Clusia; Clusia aripoensis; Clusia minor; Clusia rosea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642713339

Such a positive correlation supports the hypothesis that carburization of palladium is responsible for the increase of the rate of acetylene disappearance during againg of the catalyst. The maximum concentration of carbon in palladium at the steady-state depends on the temperature of the reaction and on the crystallite size. This concentration increases with carburization temperature and decreases with the increase of Pd crystallite size. The presence of supersaturated solution of carbon in Pd at 50°C is possible, due to a diffusion-hindered frozen state in the bulk. The catalytic properties of such a sample match the behavior of partially carburized Pd catalyst at steady-state conditions.

The GasRail USA program began in 1993 with the goal of demonstrating the environmental and economical benefits of using natural gas as a locomotive fuel. Reduced exhaust emissions were the primary focus, and a 75-percent reduction of NOx emissions from the baseline diesel locomotive was targeted. The initial phase of this program involved designing, testing, and evaluating six different natural gas combustion technologies on a single-cylinder version of the General Motors Electro-Motive Division (EMD) 710 locomotive engine. Based on the results of this evaluation, the LaCHIP combustion technology was deemed the most feasible of the six technologies for application to either passenger or freight locomotives. Further development of the LaCHIP combustion technology was conducted on the EMD 1-710 engine and subsequently on an EMD 16-710 engine. This paper discusses the results of steady-state testing of the LaCHIP technology on the EMD 16-710 engine. This testing has shown that the GasRail USA program target of 75-percent reduction in NOx emissions can be achieved with the LaCHIP technology on both a throttle notch-by-notch and weighted duty-cycle basis. The fuel efficiency penalty for the 75-percent NOx reduction is approximately 10 percent. However, standard diesel efficiency can be achieved with the LaCHIP technology with a significant NOx due to differences in fuel chemistry and combustion temperatures. Additional testing has also shown that the original diesel injector can be used without modification for pilot fuel injection and achieve these results. These test data show that a diesel locomotive engine equipped with the LaCHIP combustion technology can retain full power, efficiency, and capability while operating on 100-percent diesel fuel and achieve significant reductions in NOx emissions at full power while operating on natural gas (dual fuel).",,"Computational fluid dynamics; Diesel engines; Fuel injection; Gas emissions; Locomotives; Natural gas; Electronic unit injector; Late cycle high injection pressure; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032304773

Because the geographical distribution and relative productivity of C4 species are both correlated strongly and positively with temperature, δ13C values of palaeosol organic carbon should reflect long term vegetation dynamics and past climate variations. To improve the understanding of vegetation-climate dynamics in the North American Great Plains during the late Quaternary, δ13C of organic carbon is stacked, 14C dated palaeosol sequences in the southern and northern portions of this region have been determined. The presence of a significant C4 grass component throughout the late Quaternary at both sites indicates that both were grasslands or open savannahs during this entire period. In the southern Great Plains, variations in δ13C and relative C4 productivity between 15 000 and 9000 a BP were well correlated with climatic variation induced by glacial meltwater in the Gulf of Mexico. The relative productivity of C4 plants was greatest during the Holocene at approximately 5000 and 2000 a BP. In the northern Great Plains, δ13C and relative C4 approximately 5000 and 2000 a BP. In the northern Great Plains, δ13C and relative C4 productivity were lowest during the late Pleistocene-early Holocene, indicating cool conditions at that time. δ13C and relative C4 productivity increased rapidly after 11 000 a BP to a maxima at 7000-2000 a BP, suggesting warm conditions then. These late Quaternary δ13C records of relative C4 productivity are strongly correlated with previous climatic inferences for these regions based on other methods, suggesting that δ13C of palaeosol organic carbon may be a useful proxy for palaeotemperature in the Great Plains and perhaps in other grassland or savannah regions. Furthermore, these large shifts in the relative productivities of C3 and C4 plants (which differ in carbon, nutrient and water use characteristics) in the Great Plains during the late Quaternary may have implications for modelling climate and biogeochemical cycles at regional and global scales during this time.",,"climate change; isotopic analysis; organic carbon; paleoclimate; paleosol; Quaternary; vegetation; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032323606

The synthetic glucocorticoid dexamethasone (DE) suppresses TCDD-induced expression of CYP1B1 in RMF and REF. Suppression of CYP1B1 mRNA in RMF (maximal suppression, 70%) was observed when DEX was added 2 hr before TCDD, but was not observed with co- administration. The concentration dependence (EC50 κ 10 nM) and reversal by the antagonist, RU486, implicates the glucocorticoid receptor. DEX inhibition of TCDD-induced CYP1B1 protein needed more extensive preincubation (&gt;6 hr). TCDD induction of CYP1B1-luciferase constructs in RMF was mediated by a 265-base-pair upstream region (-810 to -1075), which was similarly suppressed (50-70%) by a 2-hr preincubation with 10-7M DEX via this enhancer region. Expression of the AhR is suppressed by DEX (70% after 12 hr), but not after the 2-hr period that was sufficient for suppression of transcription. The AhR nuclear translocator is not affected by this treatment. We conclude that glucocorticoid receptor rapidly suppresses activity of the AhR/ AhR nuclear translocator complex in the CYP1B1 enhancer region, even though lacking glucocorticoid responsive element(s). DEX inhibits proliferation of RMF in this same concentration range (35%, EC50 ~ 5 nm), indicating additional effects on intracellular activity that may link to this suppression.",,"aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; cytochrome P450 1B1; cytochrome P450 isoenzyme; dexamethasone; glucocorticoid receptor; mifepristone; unclassified drug; animal cell; animal tissue; article; drug receptor binding; embryo; enhancer region; enzyme regulation; fibroblast; nonhuman; priority journal; rat; transcription regulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031785466

A pooled hydrographic data set has been prepared, which currently contains over 100,000 station profiles (CTD, Nansen bottle, XBT and MBT) taken in the Eastern and Western Mediterranean Sea between 1900 and 1993. Climatological analyses of temperature and salinity data are performed at seasonal and monthly scales, using a variational method and a finite element numerical technique. The variational formulation had been demonstrated to be equivalent to objective analysis, and a hybridation of the statistical and variational methods allows to compute error fields associated to the climatology. The free parameters of the scheme are determined using a cross-validation algorithm to extract the best seasonal statistics from the observed data sets. Compared to earlier climatologies, the recent analyses show significant improvements with respect to the regional scales of the general circulation gyres. In addition, several features of the general circulation are described with a better accuracy. Finally, the barotropic equations (external mode) of a free-surface, primitive equation model are integrated in time to diagnostically adjust the sea-surface elevation to the thermohaline structures. Geostrophic velocities are then computed, integrating the thermal-wind equations with the sea-surface pressure as a reference. Results of fully prognostic, three-dimensional, primitive equation models are compared with these diagnostic computations in order to identify which features of the general circulation can be captured by observations.","Climatology; Mediterranean Sea; Oceanography","Mediterranean Sea; circulation modeling; climatology; data set; oceanic circulation; physicochemical property; Mediterranean Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031798045

Microscopic calculation within a realistic model shows that direct tunneling in iron group systems leads to about a 30% change in resistance, which is close but lower than experimentally observed values. The larger observed values of the TMR might be a result of tunneling involving surface polarized states. It is found that tunneling via resonant defect states in the barrier radically decreases the TMR by order of magnitude. One-magnon emission is shown to reduce the TMR, whereas phonons increase the effect. The inclusion of both magnons and phonons reasonably explains an unusual bias dependence of the TMR. The model presented here is applied qualitatively to half metallics with 100% spin polarization, where one-magnon processes are suppressed and the change in resistance in the absence of spin mixing on impurities may be arbitrarily large. Even in the case of imperfect magnetic configurations, the resistance change can be a few 1000%.

The fluorescence decays were accurately described in the case of Tb 3+ codoping because of resonant energy transfer, thus of more precise estimations of energy transfer parameters from the absorption and emission spectra. in the case of Eu 3+ codoping, the Tm 3+ - Eu 3+ energy transfers need to be phonon-assisted to compensate for the reduced overlap between the Tm 3+ emission and Eu 3+ absorption spectra and the models, though giving satisfactory results, appeared less powerful. Based on these results, optimized values for the dopant concentrations were finally derived to keep high the fluorescence quantum efficiency of 3H 4 and to shorten the lifetime of the 3F 4 energy levels of The Tm 3+ ion in order to alleviate the problem of self-termination of the 3H 4 - 3F 4 laser transition occuring around 1-5 μm.","Energy transfer; Europium; Laser crystal; LiYF 4; Terbium; Thulium","Absorption spectroscopy; Dynamics; Emission spectroscopy; Energy transfer; Europium; Lithium compounds; Parameter estimation; Quantum efficiency; Semiconductor doping; Single crystals; Terbium; Thulium; Laser crystals; Solid state lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032204382

In order to further assess these findings at high spectral resolution a method allowing the calculation of longwave clear sky fluxes and cooling rates based on the GENLN2 line-by-line radiative transfer code has been implemented, and studies have been carried out of the sensitivity and response of the outgoing planetary radiation to changes in atmospheric composition. Comparisons with other line-by-line model show typical cooling rate agreement of within 0.05 K day-1 at all pressure levels. Taking two model atmospheres representative of tropical (TRP) and sub-arctic winter (SAW) conditions, several experiments have been performed to assess both the presentday greenhouse effect, and the impact of perturbations in carbon dioxide and water vapour amounts on the greenhouse trapping of each atmosphere. The results reinforce the importance of the far i.r. with, for the present-day conditions, one third and one quarter of the total absolute greenhouse forcing calculated to occur in this region for the SAW and TRP atmospheres respectively. The sensitivity of the normalised greenhouse effect to water vapour concentrations is greatest in the far i.r. for the SAW atmosphere, and in the window region for the TRP; this sensitivity differing most between atmospheres in the far i.r. The sensitivity to vertical variations in water vapour perturbation shows a peak response located at mid-tropospheric levels within the window region for the TRP case, and within the far i.r. at upper tropospheric levels for the SAW atmosphere. The carbon dioxide perturbation experiments indicate the increasingly important role played by the weaker carbon dioxide bands as concentrations increase, and provide a further illustration of the fallacy of the suggestion of a 'CO2 saturated' atmosphere. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

A high-voltage ac signal was used to produce a plasma between the fins of a turning rotor and an immobile stator, through which a 2.5% CO2 in He mixture was passed. The analysis of the product gases was achieved using a mass spectrometer equipped with a partial pressure analyzer, and the decomposition of CO2 was found to proceed to CO and O2 with &gt;80% selectivity. The percentage conversion of CO2 increases with decreasing flow rate and increasing input voltage. The opposite trend is obtained when the energy efficiency is evaluated. Spectroscopic data indicate that the diluent gas plays a role in the dissociation of CO2, likely via charge and energy transfer from excited state He species to produce vibrationally excited CO2+ intermediates.

With the Rh-coated reactor, conversions as high as 30.5%, reaction rates of 8.07 × 10-4 mol/h, and energy efficiencies of 3.55% could be obtained.

This behavior is consistent with the prediction by Kukla and Matthews (1972) that the Holocene interglacial will terminate suddenly with a jump to another of the climate system's modes of operation. This is what happened at the end of the last period of peak interglaciation. However, complicating the situation is evidence that ice sheet growth during the transition from marine stage 5e to 5d preceded the shut down of the Atlantic's conveyor circulation which is thought to have brought Europe's Eemian to a close. If so, then in the natural course of events, the end of the present interglaciation awaits the onset of ice cap growth. However, it must be kept in mind that the ongoing buildup of greenhouse gases may alter the natural course of events. In particular, the warming and wetting of the planet will gradually reduce the density of surface waters in the regions where deep waters form. As this reduction is not likely to be symmetrical between the northern Atlantic and the margin of the Antarctic continent, the current near balance between deep water production in the north and south may be disrupted causing an abrupt reorganization of the ocean's thermohaline circulation. Based on the paleoclimatic record, such a reorganization would have had a profound impact on the planet's climate.",,"climate change; deep water formation; Holocene; interglacial; thermohaline circulation",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032144574

We measured the 13C enrichments of expired CO2, plasma and urine free phenylalanine and lysine and estimated flux and oxidation rates in adult humans (n = 12) who received a 4-h oral, primed, equal dose infusion of either c-[1-13C]phenylalanine, L-[1- 13C]lysine (D-lysine = 1.6%) or L-[1-13C]Jysine (D-lysine ≤ 0.2%). Steady fed state conditions were established by feeding subjects eight hourly meals beginning 4 h before the start of the oral infusion protocol. Isotopic plateau in CO2, plasma and urine was achieved within 120 min of phenyl- alanine or lysine infusion. At isotopic plateau, the mean ratio of plasma to urine enrichment was 1.0 ± 0.04 (SEM), 0.39 ± 0.03 and 0.97 ± 0.02 for L- [1-13C]phenylalanine, L-[1-13C]lysine (o-lysine = 1.6%) and L-[1- 13C]lysine (o-lysine ≤ 0.2%), respectively. There was good agreement between isotopic enrichment in plasma and urine for L-[l-13C]phenylalanine and L-[1-13C]lysine (D-lysine ≤ 0.2%). However, use of L-[1-13C]lysine (D-lysine = 1.6%) resulted in significantly higher enrichment in urine, probably due to renal tubular discrimination of D-lysine. Mean flux rates for phenylalanine and lysine were consistent with the literature. Thus, the oral, primed, equal dose infusion produces the isotopic steady-state condition required for amino acid flux and oxidation determination within an 8-h period.","Amino acids; Humans; Oxidation flux stable isotopes","carbon 13; carbon dioxide; lysine; phenylalanine; adult; amino acid blood level; amino acid metabolism; amino acid transport; article; clinical protocol; controlled study; feeding; female; human; human experiment; male; normal human; oxidation; steady state; urinary excretion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031738155

As a means to differentiate soils and identify sources of fugitive dust, we have developed methods to produce fingerprints from microorganisms in soil. Fingerprinting methods described in this report are based on the relative amounts of microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) extracted from soil or dust and identified by gas chromatography. These fingerprinting methods generate multivariate data (fatty acid percentages), which can be used in principal component analysis (PCA) to assess relationships among samples. Soil samples from California's Central Valley, representing different soil types, crops and locations, were analyzed for their PLFA fingerprints. PCA plots of fingerprint data showed clear separation of cotton and almond soils. In these plots cotton soils of similar texture were grouped by geographic location, while almond soils from the same location were grouped by soil texture. Redundancy analysis revealed that both soil texture and crop type were significantly correlated with variation in PLFA fingerprints across soils. Our results indicate that PLFA fingerprinting of soil microbial communities, will differentiate soils in a reproducible manner and that PLFA data can also be used to relate bulk dust samples to their source soils from individual fields. Adaptation of fingerprinting technology to field monitoring of PM10 from multiple sources will require further development of multivariate data analysis procedures as a prerequisite for use in source apportionment.",,"Biomarkers; Dust; Fatty acids; Microorganisms; Soils; Biological markers; Phospholipid fatty acids; Principal component analysis; Particles (particulate matter)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032268695

Climate, as well as factors of intrinsic litter chemistry, often govern the rate of decomposition and thus the dynamics of these processes. Initial concentrations of nitrogen and recalcitrant carbon compounds in plant litter are good predictors of litter decomposition rates in many systems. The effect of exogenous nitrogen availability on decay rates, however, is not well defined. Microclimate factors vary widely within alpine tundra sites, potentially affecting litter decay rates at the local scale. A controlled factorial experiment was performed to assess the influence of landscape position and exogenous nitrogen additions on decomposition of surface foliage and buried root litter in an alpine tundra in the Front Range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado, U.S.A. Litter bags were placed in three communities representing a gradient of soil moisture and temperature. Ammonium nitrate was applied once every 30 days at a rate of 20 g N·m-2 during the 3-month growing season. Data, as part of the Long-Term Inter-site Decomposition Experiment Team project, were analyzed to ascertain the effects of intrinsic nitrogen and carbon fraction chemistry on litter decay in alpine systems. Soil moisture was found to be the primary controlling factor in surface litter mass loss. Root litter did not show significant mass loss following first growing season. Nitrogen additions had no effect on nitrogen retention, or decomposition, of surface or buried root litter compared with controls. The acid-insoluble carbon fraction was a good predictor of mass loss in surface litters, showing a strong negative correlation. Curiously, N concentration appeared to retard root decomposition, although degrees of freedom limit the confidence of this observation. Given the slow rate of decay and N loss from root litter, root biomass appears to be a long-term reservoir for C and N in the alpine tundra.","Alpine tundra; LIDET; Litter decomposition; Nitrogen deposition; Niwot Ridge","alpine tundra; ammonium nitrate; carbon dioxide fixation; chemistry; climate; litter; litter decomposition; nutrient cycling; organic matter; soil; soil moisture; United States; decomposition; ecosystem dynamics; litter; nutrient cycling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032464069

The defect structure and local surface composition of the bimetallic substrates, which are produced by epitaxial growth of monolayer Pt islands or by Pt deposition and subsequent surface alloying, are characterized by high-resolution STM images with chemical contrast. TPD and TPR experiments for CO adsorption/oxidation on these surfaces show a distinct lowering of the CO adsorption energy on the bimetallic surfaces with respect to the pure Ru(0001) and Pt(111) surfaces, with the onset of CO desorption already at 230 K. The reduction in adsorption energy is attributed to an electronic modification of the deposit metal due to interaction with the Ru(0001) substrate. The bimetallic surface alloy catalyzes CO oxidation under UHV conditions. The reduced temperature for CO2 desorption as compared to Pt(111) indicates an even lower barrier than on the latter surface, whereas the pure Ru(0001) surface is inert under these conditions. The results are discussed with respect to the superior CO tolerance of bimetallic PtRu catalysts in low-temperature fuel cells as compared to monometallic Pt catalysts, leading to a mechanistic explanation of that phenomenon distinctly different from previous ideas. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Parallel activities by both the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (ratified by 42 governments of the 55 countries in the UNECE area) and the EU are making use of the critical loads approach and integrated assessment models to arrive at cost optimized scenarios for environmental protection. Critical loads and critical levels are used to define the thresholds for effects; as these are usually difficult to attain they are being used to set intermediate target objectives. A number of different methods for setting such targets, the so-called 'gap closures' are being investigated. While the basis for estimating critical loads and levels has been extensively researched, collection of the necessary data and the development of methods continue to evolve. Current discussions on international agreements for emission reductions are based upon the best available information, but this has limitations which are often difficult to build into the decision making process. It is to be expected that any currently derived results will be an interim and very approximate solution for the problems resulting from pollutant emissions. Further steps will require better information on impacts and probably alternative approaches to the critical loads concept as it currently stands.","Abatement strategies; Acidification; Critical load; Eutrophication; Ozone; Targets","nitrogen; atmospheric pollution; critical state; emission control; pollution control; acidification; air pollution; air quality; atmospheric dispersion; conference paper; environmental protection; eutrophication; government; nitrification; ozone layer; photochemical smog; Europe",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032418466

The oxidation of n-C8H18 appears to be delicately balanced between two kinetic regimes. At low [C8H18]/[O2] the coverage of oxygen on the Pt surface is high, while that of carbonaceous species is negligible, resulting in hydrocarbon oxidation being inhibited by oxygen and in the oxidation of NO to NO2. At higher [C8H18]/[O2] the surface is saturated with carbonaceous species, while the coverage of oxygen is negligible, resulting in hydrocarbon oxidation being zero order in hydrocarbon concentration and in no NO2 formation being observed. The state of the Pt surface affects the mechanism of NOx reduction. Thus, NOx reduction via dissociation of NO on the Pt surface is favoured by a high coverage of carbonaceous species, while a high coverage of oxygen favours NOx reduction by reaction between n-C8H18-derived species and spilt-over NO2 on the Al2O3 support and/or metal-support interface. Separate kinetic models capable of fitting the data in these two regions have been developed. © 1998 Academic Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000080754

The first EOS platform, AMI, scheduled for launch in 1998, includes five instruments designed to make radiometric and reflectance measurements of the earth over a wavelength range extending from the visible to the thermal infrared. The goal of the EOS-AMI platform and instruments is to advance the scientific understanding of the earth in the areas of clouds, aerosols, radiative balance, terrestrial and oceanic characterization, and the carbon cycle. In order to achieve this goal, the EOS-AMI instruments must produce state-of-the-art accurate, precise, and consistent radiance and reflectance measurements over their five-year lifetimes. In addition, the production of continuous remote-sensing data from multiple instruments on several platforms requires that the remote-sensing measurements of the AMI platform be radiometrically tied to the measurements made by instruments on successive platforms. This is achieved through careful prelaunch and postlaunch instrument calibration, cross-calibration, and level IB data validation (i.e., vicarious calibration). This paper presents an overview of the calibration, cross-calibration, and level IB data validation strategy for the AMI platform. © 1998 IEEE.","Calibration; Earth Observing System (EOS); Radiometry; Reflectance; Remote sensing","Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric radiation; Calibration; Clouds; Geostationary satellites; Radiometry; Reflectometers; Satellite observatories; Weather satellites; Earth observing system (EOS); Remote sensing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032117361

Plasma passing through a shock front will be compressed and heated according to the jump conditions across the shock discontinuity. Shocks in accretion flows may therefore have important consequences for the flow structure and emission characteristics. The equations governing adiabatic (nonradiative) shocks in relativistic plasmas are presented. Relativistically correct equations of state are used that include the effects of radiation pressure and energy density, and pair equilibria are calculated for the postshock flow. Postshock states are determined for accretion flows with typical accretion-driven astronomical sources, and possible dynamics of the postshock flow are suggested. In particular, we find that cool, optically thick accretion flows undergoing shocks may become radiation or pair dominated and that the postshock plasma will likely become optically thin before returning to steady state conditions. © 1998.

GEMS/Air has operated more than 250 ambient air monitoring stations in more than 50 nations since 1970. The focus has been on improving air quality data and emission inventories in developing countries, ultimately leading to setting appropriate health standards and developing national plans for air quality improvements. As funding is often limited in these countries, WHO has established the ""twinning"" concept of matching air pollution agencies in Europe and the United States with developing countries needing assistance. The notion is for a do-nor agency to provide used air monitors and technical assistance to a ""sister city or country."" Such monitors, not necessarily state-of-the-art in the United States but clearly operational, would provide improved monitoring data in many developing countries, thus leading to a better understanding of the worldwide effects of air pollution on public health and natural resources. The twinning program began in late 1994 with Ventura County, CA and Manila, Philippines. Since 1994, more than 26 countries and organizations have expressed interest in participating in the twinning program. In addition to the Philippines, twinning arrangements have been completed with Nepal, Kenya, Ghana, and Tanzania as recipients and donor agencies in California, Maryland, and the Netherlands. This paper describes the process, participation, and the ultimate goals of developing a Global Air Quality Partnership among the participants. It addresses worldwide air quality problems, especially in the world's largest cities. Finally, it discusses problems encountered in providing technical assistance to developing countries and how international organizations, such as the Air & Waste Management Association, might help improve air quality management in these areas.",,"Ventura",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242866388

On-line haemodiafiltration (HDF) seems to be the best therapeutic option to achieve this goal at the present time. By enhancing convective clearances through highly permeable membranes, HDF offers the greatest solute fluxes both for low and higher molecular weight uraemic toxins. As for example, in our routinely performed HDF programme based on 3 weekly sessions lasting 3-4 h each, double-pool urea Kt/V achieved was 1.55 ± 0.20 and β2-microglobulin Kt/V was 0.91. By producing substitution fluid from fresh dialysate, the technique of HDF is simplified and becomes economically affordable. By improving the haemodynamic tolerance, HDF allows more elderly and high risk cardiovascular patients to be treated more safely. By using bicarbonate-buffered infusate, HDF facilitates the correction of acidosis. Both by using ultrapure bicarbonate dialysate and down-regulating the membrane reactivity via a 'protein cake', HDF introduces the first step for a full haemocompatibility concept. Finally, by giving access to virtually unlimited amounts of sterile and non-pyrogenic fluid, HDF should introduce new therapeutic options such as a totally automated and feed-back-controlled machine. Today's on-line HDF is already a step forward to enhance the overall efficacy of renal replacement therapy and to improve the global care of ESRF patients.","Dialysis; End-stage renal failure; On-line haemodiafiltration; Renal replacement therapy","beta 2 microglobulin; bicarbonate; buffer; urea; uremic toxin; acidosis; automation; cardiovascular disease; conference paper; dialysate; feedback system; hemodialysis; hemodynamics; hemofiltration; high risk patient; human; kidney failure; membrane; molecular weight; priority journal; safety",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031967747

The impact of such changes on agricultural systems in mid- to high-latitude regions are predicted to be less severe than in low-latitude regions, and possibly even beneficial, although the influence of pests and diseases is rarely taken into account. Most studies have concluded that insect pests will generally become more abundant as temperatures increase, through a number of inter-related processes, including range extensions and phenological changes, as well as increased rates of population development, growth, migration and overwintering. A gradual, continuing rise in atmospheric CO2 will affect pest species directly (ie the CO2 fertilization effect) and indirectly (via interactions with other environmental variables). However, individual species responses to elevated CO2 vary: consumption rates of insect herbivores generally increase, but this does not necessarily compensate fully for reduced leaf nitrogen. The consequent effects on performance are strongly mediated via the host species. Some recent experiments under elevated CO2 have suggested that aphids may become more serious pests, although other studies have discerned no significant effects on sap-feeding homopterans. However, few, if any of these experiments have fully considered the effects on pest population dynamics. Climate change is also considered from the perspective of changes in the distribution and abundance of species and communities. Marked changes in the distribution of well-documented species - including Odonata, Orthoptera and Lepidoptera - in northwestern Europe, in response to unusually hot summers, provide useful indications of the potential effects of climate change. Migrant pests are expected to respond more quickly to climate change than plants, and may be able to colonize newly available crops/habitats. Range expansions, and the removal of edge effects, could result in the increased abundance of species presently near the northern limits of their ranges in the UK. However, barriers to range expansions, or shifts, may include biotic (competition, predation, parasitism and disease), as well as abiotic, factors. Climatic phenomena, ecosystem processes and human activities are interactive and interdependent, making long-term predictions extremely tenuous. Nevertheless, it appears prudent to prepare for the possibility of increases in the diversity and abundance of pest species in the UK, in the context of climate change.",,"biological invasion; climate change; crop pest; environmental impact; insect; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032419040

The mathematical models of real world energy systems are usually multi-period linear optimization (LP) programs. In these models, the objective function describes the total discounted costs of covering the demand for final energy or energy services. The demand for various forms of energy or energy services is the driving force of the models. By using such LP formulations, decision makers can elaborate suitable strategies to solve their planning problems such as the development of emission reduction strategies. Uncertainties that affect the process of energy system planning can be divided in parameter and in decision uncertainties. Data or parameter uncertainties can be addressed either by stochastic optimization or by the methodology of fuzzy linear programming (fip). In addition, fuzzy linear programming allows the explicit incorporation of decision uncertainties in a mathematical model. Employing the parallels between multi-objective linear programming (MOLP) and FLP, problems of FLP in DSS-applications are pointed out and solutions are offered. The proposed interactive procedure for solving FLP problems is based on the methodology of aspiration-reservation based decision support and still enables modelling of uncertainties in a fuzzy sense.

Global climatic change may modify the net carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems, causing feedbacks on atmospheric CO2 and climate. We describe a model for investigating terrestrial carbon exchange and its response to climatic variation based on the processes of plant photosynthesis, carbon allocation, litter production, and soil organic carbon decomposition. The model is used to produce geographical patterns of net primary production (NPP), carbon stocks in vegetation and soils, and the seasonal variations in net ecosystem production (NEP) under both contemporary and future climates. For contemporary climate, the estimated global NPP is 57.0 Gt C y-1, carbon stocks in vegetation and soils are 640 Gt C and 1358 Gt C, respectively, and NEP varies from -0.5 Gt C in October to 1.6 Gt C in July. For a doubled atmospheric CO2 concentration and the corresponding climate, we predict that global NPP will rise to 69.6 Gt C y-1, carbon stocks in vegetation and soils will increase by, respectively, 133 Gt C and 160 Gt C, and the seasonal amplitude of NEP will increase by 76%. A doubling of atmospheric CO2 without climate change may enhance NPP by 25% and result in a substantial increase in carbon stocks in vegetation and soils. Climate change without CO2 elevation will reduce the global NPP and soil carbon stocks, but leads to an increase in vegetation carbon because of a forest extension and NPP enhancement in the north. By combining the effects of CO2 doubling, climate change, and the consequent redistribution of vegetation, we predict a strong enhancement in NPP and carbon stocks of terrestrial ecosystems. This study simulates the possible variation in the carbon exchange at equilibrium state. We anticipate to investigate the dynamic responses in the carbon exchange to atmospheric CO2 elevation and climate change in the past and future.","Carbon storage; Climate change; Net ecosystem production; Net primary production; Terrestrial ecosystems","carbon dioxide enrichment; climatic change; primary production; terrestrial ecosystem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031747201

The analysis and interpretation of the data was complicated by the fact that 4 of these observations were used for the on-board calibration of the CCDs spectral response. The present standard analysis shows that, in agreement with official recommendations, a conservative systematic error (at low energies) of 2-3 x 1020 cm-2 must be assumed when analyzing ASCA SIS data. A soft-excess, with variable flux and/or shape, has been clearly detected as well as flux and spectral variability. An anti-correlation has been found between the spectral index and the flux in the 2-10 keV energy range. Fitting the data with the latest available calibration matrices, we also detect an emission line at 5.4-5.7 keV (6.3-6.6 keV in the quasar frame) in only the two observations with lowest fluxes where it is weak (EW ∼ 20-30 eV), narrow and consistent with being produced by Fe Kα emission from neutral matter. Overall, the observations are qualitatively consistent with a variable, non-thermal X-ray continuum emission (a power law with Γ ∼ 1.6, possibly produced in the innermost regions of the radio-optical jet), plus underlying ""Seyfert-like"" features (a soft-excess and Fe Kα line emission). When the continuum (jet) emission is in a low state, the Seyfert-like spectral features (soft-excess, iron line, and possibly a steep power law plus reflection continuum) are more easily seen.","Galaxies: Active; Galaxies: Individual (3C 273); X-rays: Spectra",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032222104

An initial analysis of images from MSX Galactic plane survey data reveals dark clouds seen in silhouette against the bright emission from the Galactic plane (Egan et al). These clouds have mid-infrared extinctions in excess of 2 mag at 8 μm. We probed the physical properties of 10 of these MSX dark clouds using millimeter-wave molecular rotational lines as an indicator of dense molecular gas. All 10 clouds were detected in millimeter spectral lines of H2CO, which confirms the presence of dense gas. The distances to these clouds range from 1 to 8 kiloparsecs and their diameters from 0.4 to 15.0 pc. Excitation analysis of the observed lines indicates that the clouds are cold (T &lt; 20 K) and dense [n(H2) &gt; 105 cm-3]. Some of the clouds have nearby H H regions, H2O masers, and other tracers of star formation at comparable spectral line velocities; however, only one cloud contains embedded centimeter or infrared sources. The lack of midto far-infrared emission associated with these clouds suggests that they are not currently forming high-mass stars. If star formation is present in these clouds, it is clearly protostellar class 0 or earlier. © 1998. The American Astronomical Society.

The highest total concentrations of carbon and nitrogen are found in the central deep part of the Baltic proper. The inorganic concentration of carbon is normally far below 1% in the entire Baltic Sea except for some localities with anoxic conditions where authigenic precipitation of mixed manganese carbonates occurs, for example, the eastern Gotland deep. Manganese seems to be of essential importance for such precipitation. As in the case for carbon, a dominant proportion of the nitrogen found in the sediments is organically bound. For phosphorus, on the other hand, a dominant proportion is inorganically bound. The highest total concentrations are found in the eastern part of Gulf of Finland and in the well-oxidized sediments of the Bothnian Bay and Bothnia Sea. The organic C/N ratio is very stable vertically through the sediment very stable at each location indicating that the degradation of the organic matter in the sediment proceeds in a C/N proportion. The organic C/P ratio within the sediment departs considerably from the Redfield ratio, mainly due to more or less instantaneous releases of easily hydrolyzable organic phosphorus molecules.","Baltic Sea; Burial; Carbon; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Sediment","carbon; marine sediment; nitrogen; phosphorus; soft-bottom environment; spatial distribution; Baltic Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032466654

Total community carbon metabolism exhibited a marked autotrophism and high short term changes, dampening seasonal trends. Autotrophism and heterotrophism of the lagoon were controlled by phytoplankton biomass variations. In the presence of sediment, diurnal net benthic production was 11 to 64% of total diurnal net production, and nocturnal net benthic mineralization was 21 to 52% of total nocturnal net mineralization. The imbrication between the pelagic and benthic organic carbon cycles regulated carbon metabolism of the total community. A severe temporary nitrogen limitation, a fish kill and a temporary shift in primary producers did not substantially change metabolic rates because appropriate shifts occurred from the pelagic carbon cycle to the benthic carbon cycle, and vice-versa.","Autotrophic activity; Benthic carbon metabolism; Heterotrophic activity; Pelagic carbon metabolism; Tropical lagoon","benthos; biological production; carbon cycle; lagoon; metabolism; Brazil; Lagoa da Barra",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7844243962

Synoptic techniques which identify low centres and blocking anticylones have been used in preference to time-filtered variances of geopotential height as these may not uniquely identify true synoptic systems. Changes in mid-latitude variability are qualitatively similar in experiments that include changes in greenhouse gases only and those that also include the direct effects of sulphate aerosols. The presence of aerosols reduces the warming of the nothern continents but the relatively larger warming of the land compared to the oceans remains in both experiments and at higher latitudes this leads to a reduced poleward transient flux of energy. There is an increase in the transient flux of energy at most latitudes, due to a greater transport of latent heat arising from the greater moisture availability. The total number of Northern Hemisphere storms decreases but there is a tendency towards deeper low centres. There are fewer storms in the North Pacific and North Atlantic source regions where the local baraclinicity is reduced. The climatological tracks from these regions are shorter with decreases at the northeastern ends of the tracks and increases in the regions with maximum counts towards the centre of the ocean basins. These changes are not generally statistically significant. The greatest changes in blocking anticyclones occur in the North Pacific where there is a downstream shift in the region of maximum activity. Changes in stationary waves show a strong increase in the PNA oscillation which may be influencing the changes in blocking as has been found by other authors. Possible mechanisms for forcing this reponse are speculated but it will need further experiments to unravel them.",,"aerosol; atmosphere; climate variation; greenhouse gas; Northern Hemisphere; ocean coupling; sulphate aerosol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031744618

Atmospheric deposition further contributes as a source of N. These nonpoint inputs of nutrients are difficult to measure and regulate because they derive from activities dispersed over wide areas of land and are variable in time due to effects of weather. In aquatic ecosystems, these nutrients cause diverse problems such as toxic algal blooms, loss of oxygen, fish kills, loss of biodiversity (including species important for commerce and recreation), loss of aquatic plant beds and coral reefs, and other problems. Nutrient enrichment seriously degrades aquatic ecosystems and impairs the use of water for drinking, industry, agriculture, recreation, and other purposes. Based on our review of the scientific literature, we are certain that (1) eutrophication is a widespread problem in rivers, lakes, estuaries, and coastal oceans, caused by over-enrichment with P and N; (2) nonpoint pollution, a major source of P and N to surface waters of the United States, results primarily from agriculture and urban activity, including industry; (3) inputs of P and N to agriculture in the form of fertilizers exceed outputs in produce in the United States and many other nations; (4) nutrient flows to aquatic ecosystems are directly related to animal stocking densities, and under high livestock densities, manure production exceeds the needs of crops to which the manure is applied; (5) excess fertilization and manure production cause a P surplus to accumulate in soil, some of which is transported to aquatic ecosystems; and (6) excess fertilization and manure production on agricultural lands create surplus N, which is mobile in many soils and often leaches to downstream aquatic ecosystems, and which can also volatilize to the atmosphere, redepositing elsewhere and eventually reaching aquatic ecosystems. If current practices continue, nonpoint pollution of surface waters is virtually certain to increase in the future. Such an outcome is not inevitable, however, because a number of technologies, land use practices, and conservation measures are capable of decreasing the flow of nonpoint P and N into surface waters. From our review of the available scientific information, we are confident that: (1) nonpoint pollution of surface waters with P and N could be reduced by reducing surplus nutrient flows in agricultural systems and processes, reducing agricultural and urban runoff by diverse methods, and reducing N emissions from fossil fuel burning; and (2) eutrophication can be reversed by decreasing input rates of P and N to aquatic ecosystems, but rates of recovery are highly variable among water bodies. Often, the eutrophic state is persistent, and recovery is slow.","Agriculture; Estuary; Eutrophication; Lake; Nitrogen; Nonpoint pollution; Phosphorus; River; Runoff; Stream","aquatic environment; nitrogen; nonpoint source pollution; phosphorus; United States; algae; Animalia; Anthozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031826381

Targeting exclusive antigens in atherosclerotic plaques with antibodies may provide a noninvasive means to detect rapidly proliferative atherosclerotic lesions. 111In-labeled negative charge-modified Z2D3 F(ab')2 (Z2D3) specific for an antigen expressed exclusively by proliferating smooth muscle cells has been shown to accumulate in rabbit atherosclerotic plaques. Methods. The safety, biodistribution, accumulation, and elimination of Z2D3 were assessed in 11 patients who were candidates for carotid endarterectomy. The presence of atheromas in these patients was confirmed by angiography and Doppler ultrasound. Z2D3 (250 μg) labeled with 5 mCi of 111In was administered by slow intravenous injection. Planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images were obtained 4, 24, 48, and 72 hours later. Carotid endarterectomy was performed and the surgical specimens were imaged, weighed, gamma-counted, and analyzed by immunostaining. Results. Uptake of Z2D3 at the site of the carotid plaques was observed in the planar and SPECT views at 4 hours in all subjects. In addition, antibody uptake was noted in the contralateral vessel in 5 subjects. SPECT images identified the atherosclerotic plaques with focal uptake. The antibody uptake corresponded with the angiographic location of the disease. Immunohistochemical studies of the endarterectomy specimens confirmed the localization of Z2D3 into the plaque areas containing smooth muscle cells. Adverse drug reactions were not observed. Conclusion. This study demonstrates the feasibility of targeting atherosclerotic lesions with negative charge-modified antibody. It also proposes the possibility of selective identification of various components of atherosclerotic plaque, which may contribute to determining strategies of intervention in future.","Atherosclerosis; Smooth muscle cells; Z2D3 antibody","indium 111; monoclonal antibody; adult; aged; angiography; antibody labeling; article; atherosclerotic plaque; carotid endarterectomy; cell proliferation; clinical article; Doppler echocardiography; drug accumulation; drug distribution; drug elimination; female; gamma scintigraphy; human; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; intravenous drug administration; male; priority journal; single photon emission computer tomography; smooth muscle fiber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13044294688

It is found that fully reduced Pd is inactive and that the activity increases at 533 K until a plateau in activity is achieved when 6-7 ML of PdO have formed over the surface of the Pd crystallites. The maximum activity is identical to that for fully oxidized Pd. Examination of the PdO formed under reaction conditions and during oxidation in O2 at 533 K reveals some differences. Temperature-programmed reduction in CH4 and Raman spectroscopy demonstrate that the oxide formed under reaction conditions is largely crystalline PdO, whereas the oxide formed in O2 is a mixture of amorphous and crystalline PdO. The crystalline form of PdO is found to reduce more readily than the amorphous form. It is observed that the low-temperature CH4 combustion activity of PdO can be enhanced by producing a small amount of metallic Pd on the surface of PdO. The metallic Pd is more effective than PdO for the dissociative adsorption of CH4. It is hypothesized that the products of CH4 adsorption on Pd, Hs and CHx,s (x = 3-1), rapidly diffuse to the Pd/PdO interface and then reduce the PdO to Pd. The effects of metallic Pd cannot be sustained, though, under steady-state conditions, because the metallic Pd is oxidized back to PdO. © 1998 Academic Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002702350

The study assessed the impact on participant behavior of a two-and-one-half day National Informal Educators Workshop and Videoconference held November 14-16, 1994. The workshops were located in seven down-link sites around the continental U.S. and Hawaii. The program utilized a variety of pedagogical techniques during five hours of satellite programming with national expertise on global change topics (natural variability, greenhouse effect, ozone depletion, ecosystem response, and population and resource distribution) and applications of that information with local experts in regional workshops. Participants implemented many personal and professional behavior changes after participation in this program. Six behavior change scales were created from assessment of survey responses (four coefficient alphas were above .7, one was .68, and one was .58). Personal behavior changes grouped into three categories: Use of Fewer Resources (acts of everyday life generally under volitional control), Purchasing Choices/Options (less frequent acts, not under total volitional control, with significant environmental effect over the lifetime of the decision, e.g., an automobile) and Increased Awareness and Discussion (indicating changes in ""habits of mind""). The professional behavior changes also grouped into three categories: Curriculum Development (developing/revising curricula including new knowledge); Networking (with colleagues from the program); and Office Procedures (reflecting environmentally responsible behavior). The statistically significant behavior changes implemented correspond with increases in content knowledge, confidence, a developing national network, regional applications, and satisfaction with the program. © 1998 Plenum Publishing Corporation.","Behavior change; Education; Global change; Responsible environmental behavior",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54649083473

The more pronounced degradation in image contrast deep within a confocally imaged sample is primarily due to scattered emission photons, which reduce the signal and increase the local background as measurements of point spread functions indicated that resolution does not significantly change with increasing depth for either mode of microscopy. Multiphoton imaging does not suffer from degradation of signal-to-background to nearly the same extent as confocal imaging because this method is insensitive to scatter of the emitted signal. Direct detection of emitted photons using an external photodetector mounted close to the objective (possible only in a multiphoton imaging system) improves system sensitivity and the utilization of scattered emission photons for imaging. We demonstrate that this technique provides yet further improvements in the capability of multiphoton excitation imaging to produce good quality images from deeper within tissue relative to confocal imaging.",,"article; comparative study; confocal microscopy; device; fluorescence microscopy; image analysis; imaging system; optical density; tissue section",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031719058

Atmospheric concentration of radiatively active CO2, methane, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons has increased to cause global warming. In Australia temperature is projected to rise between 1 and 3°C by 2100. This review is the result of a recent workshop on the potential impact of climate change on plant diseases of economic significance to Australia. It gives an overview of projected changes in Australian climate and the current state of knowledge on the effect of climate change on plant diseases. Based on an assessment of important diseases of wheat and other cereals, sugarcane, deciduous fruits, grapevine, vegetables and forestry species, climate change in Australia may reduce, increase or have no effect on some diseases. Impacts will be felt in altered geographical distribution and crop loss due to changes in the physiology of host-pathogen interaction. Changes will occur in the type, amount and relative importance of pathogens and diseases. Host resistance may be overcome more rapidly due to accelerated pathogen evolution from increased fecundity at high CO2 and/or enhanced UV-B radiation. However, uncertainties about climate change predictions and the paucity of knowledge limit our ability to predict potential impacts on plant diseases. Both experimental and modelling approaches are available for impact assessment research. As the development and implementation of mitigation strategies take a long time, more research is urgently needed and we hope this review will stimulate interest.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032367558

This article reports on one part of the study, i.e., on findings that explicate the nature of community health nursing practice in a western Canadian province, as it has changed during the past decade, as it is currently practiced, and as it is expected to develop in the future. What, in other words, is the nature of the community practice for which nursing students should be prepared? An action research design guided the study. Participants were recruited from all major urban, rural, and northern settings in which baccalaureate nurses practice throughout the province. The perspective of relevant people was considered important, i.e., nurses practicing in the community, administrators, and educators of future community nurses. One hundred eighteen (118) participants were interviewed in 27 focus groups. Data were tape recorded, transcribed, and analyzed for content. Among the themes identified were those that captured changes community health nurses experienced in their nursing practice. Nurses also described how they thought practice would evolve in the years to come. These themes are discussed within a primary health care framework in which nurses can be expected to play a more active role in shaping community health nursing practice.",,"article; Canada; community health nursing; education; human; nurse administrator; nursing education; questionnaire; Canada; Community Health Nursing; Education, Nursing, Baccalaureate; Faculty, Nursing; Humans; Nurse Administrators; Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032012842

We performed MR scans with FMPIR on 42 patients with suspected neocortical epilepsy. Ten MR studies were read prospectively as showing FCD; these case histories, electroencephalographic studies, and neuroimaging data were reviewed. Eight of these patients subsequently underwent focal cortical resection guided by intraoperative electrocorticography. The MR findings were correlated with pathological findings in these 8 patients. For purposes of radiological-pathological correlation, the FCD lesions were divided into two classes. Radiological classification was based on the absence (type A) or presence (type B) of T2 prolongation of the subcortical white matter. Pathological grading as type I or type II was based on a previously described pathological grading system. Specific MR findings associated with FCD included focal blurring of the gray- white matter interface (n = 9), thickening of the cortical ribbon (n = 7), and T2 prolongation of the subcortical white matter (n = 4). In 3 patients, the only MR finding that suggested FCD was localized blurring of the gray- white matter junction. In 2 of these 3 patients, the MR diagnosis of FCD could be made only by FMPIR. FCD was confirmed histologically in 7 of 8 patients, with insufficient tissue for complete histopathological evaluation in 1 case. Radiological classification of FCD agreed with pathological classification in 5 of 7 cases. Correlation of MR findings with intraoperative electrocorticography results indicated that the MR study localized the epileptogenic lesion correctly in 8 of 8 cases. Scalp ictal electroencephalographic studies localized the epileptogenic lesion in 5 of 8 cases; positron emission tomographic scans were locally abnormal in 3 of 3 cases. FMPIR MR imaging permitted accurate diagnosis and localization of FCD in all patients with pathologically proved FCD. MR identification of FCD aided presurgical planning and intraoperative management of these patients.",,"adolescent; adult; article; brain cortex; brain mapping; child; clinical article; diagnostic accuracy; dysplasia; electrocorticography; electroencephalography; epileptogenesis; female; histopathology; human; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; priority journal; prospective study; white matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031769304

The images were taken with camera 2 of the Near-Infrared Camera and Multiobject Spectrometer (NICMOS) as part of the Hubble Space Telescope Early Release Observations program. Molecular hydrogen emission is confined to the silhouettes embedded in the objects HST 10 (182-413) and HST 17 (183-419). This emission appears to trace the surfaces of nearly edge-on circumstellar disks and is likely to be excited by the intense far-ultraviolet (FUV) radiation field produced by nearby O stars. The presence of this emission confirms that FUV radiation penetrates to the disk surface. The absence of H2 emission in the region between the ionization front and the disk surface provides evidence that this medium is predominantly atomic. Our observations constitute the first demonstration that the dense circumstellar disks embedded in the proplyds are predominately molecular. While the central star is marginally detected at 2.15 μm in HST 10, the central star of HST 17 is clearly detected. © 1998. The American Astronomical Society.

Eighty-four samples were obtained from high-, medium- and low-polluted areas of the city. PM10 levels on roadside, sidewalk and covered walkways near a main road were 527.8 μg/m3, 466 μg/m3 and 477 μg/m3, respectively; the concentrations were not significantly different horizontally away from the emission sources. The PM10 concentrations on the second, seventh and 14th floors of a building were 305.31 μg/m3, 178.3 μg/m3 and 168.7 g/m3, respectively; the highest was on the second floor, but concentrations did not diminish from the seventh to the 14th floor. In addition, PM10 concentrations on the main street, side street and alley of an area were 155.3 μg/m3, 267.7 μg/m3 and 167.1 μg/m3, respectively; the highest concentration appeared on the side street. Furthermore, high fractions of PM10 in TSP mass were 90%, 84% and 79% for the high-, medium- and low-polluted areas. The percentages that exceed the US PM10 standard of 150 μg/m3 for the high- and medium-polluted areas were 100% and 71% and their exceedance was substantial.

The POM operation at 1053 K for 50 h, or the MCR operation at 1100 K for 6 h, did not leave any detectable amount of carbon deposit on the surface of the catalyst. Studies of XRD, XPS, and H2-TPR spectroscopies showed that the doping of small amounts of Cr3+ and La3+ to the Ni-Mg-O system led to the formation of a host-dopant-type Ni-Mg-Cr-La-O solid solution, with a considerable number of Schottky defects in the form of cationic vacancies. An increase in the degree of disorder in the solid solution due to Cr2O3 and La2O3 dissolved in NixMg1-xO lattice would be expected to enhance the mobility of the lattice oxygen anions. This would be in favor of speeding up the reaction between the carbon-containing species and reactive oxygen species via migration of the lattice O2- so as to inhibit the deposition of carbon on the surface of the catalyst. On the other hand, part of the Schottky defects in the form of cationic vacancies may diffuse to the surface, where Ni+-species can be well accommodated and stabilized, thus, forming a rich-in-Ni (with mixed valence states) surface layer. As a result, the proportion of the reducible Ni-species was pronouncedly increased, but the temperature for their reduction was considerably raised, so that the surface Ni-species were maintained with higher possibility in positive valence states under POM and MCR reaction conditions. This would, to some extent, lead to the reduction of the rate of deep dehydrogenation of methane to carbon, therefore tending to reduce, if not avoid, coking caused by an excess of carbon on the surface. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.","CO2-reforming; Coking-resistance; Methane; Ni-based catalyst; Partial oxidation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001317682

For comparison of relative stability, a relative stabilization energy D is defined as D=E([M(CO)n]z-)-nE(CO). The calculated C-O distances are lengthened monotonously with the increase of the anionic charge, but the M-C distances are significantly lengthened only in the higher reduced states. The relative stabilization energy calculated is a considerable negative value in the lower reduced states, but a larger positive value in the higher reduced states. The DFT calculations show that with the increase of the anionic charge, the Mulliken net charges on the M, C, and O atoms all increase, however, an excess of the anionic charge is mainly located at the central metal atom. The calculated C-O Mulliken bond orders decrease consistently with the increase of the anionic charge, but the M-C bond orders exhibit an irregular behavior. However, the total bond orders calculated clearly explain the higher reduced states to be considerably unstable.

The molar ratio of N2O produced (N2O/N2O + N2) varies temporally and spatially, and in some soils N2O may be the dominant end product of denitrification. The fraction of NO-3-N emitted as N:O may be due at least in part to the abundance and activity of denitrifying bacteria which possess N2O reductase. In this study, we enumerated NO-3-reducing and denitrifying bacteria, and compared and contrasted collections of denitrifying bacteria isolated from two agricultural soils, one (Auxonne, soil A) with N2O as the dominant product of denitrification, the other (Chalons, soil C) with N2 gas as the dominant product. Isolates were tested for the ability to reduce N2O, and the presence of the N2O reductase (nosZ)-like gene was evaluated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using specific primers coupled with DNA hybridization using a specific probe. The diversity and phylogenetic relationships of members of the collections were established by PCR/restriction fragment length polymorphism of 16s rDNA. The two soils had similar numbers of bacteria which used NO-3 as a terminal electron acceptor anaerobically. However, the soil A had many more denitrifiers which reduced NO-3 to gaseous products (N2O or N2) than did soil C. Collections of 258 and 281 bacteria able to grow anaerobically in the presence of NO-3 were isolated from soil A and soil C, respectively. These two collections contained 66 and 12 denitrifying isolates, respectively, the others reducing NO-3 only as far as NO-2. The presence of nosZ sequences was generally a poor predictor of N2O reducing ability: there was agreement between the occurrence of nosZ sequences and the N2O reducing ability for only 42% of the isolates; 35% of the isolates (found exclusively in soil A) without detectable nosZ sequences reduced N2O whereas 21% of the isolates carrying nosZ sequences did not reduce this gas under our assay conditions. Twenty-eight different 16S rDNA restriction patterns (using two restriction endonucleases) were distinguished among the 78 denitrifying isolates. Two types of patterns appeared to be common to both soils. Twenty-three and three types of patterns were found exclusively among bacteria isolated from soils A and C, respectively. The specific composition of denitrifying communities appeared to be different between the two soils studied. This may partly explain the differences in the behaviour of the soils concerning N2O reduction during denitrification.","16S rDNA; Denitrifying microflora; Nitrous oxide; Nitrous oxide reductase; NosZ Gene","anaerobic metabolism; biodiversity; denitrification; DNA DNA hybridization; endonuclease; genetic diversity; nitrate; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide reductase; phylogeny; polymerase chain reaction; probe; restriction enzyme analysis; restriction fragment length polymorphism; ribosomal DNA; soil; bacterium; denitrification; nitrogen dioxide; reduction; soil emission; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032426235

At low coverage (approximately 0.1 ML), Zn2+ substitutes for Ca2+ in the surface layer. Structural relaxation of the adjacent in-plane CO2-3 ions in the host surface is shown by the reduced nearest-neighbor distance of Zn-O relative to Ca-O. Relaxation of the Zn2+ ion in the out-of-plane direction is shown by the displacement of its lattice position from the ideal Ca2+ position. These relaxations, resulting in a local lattice buckling feature at the Zn2+ adsorption site, can be fully explained as the combined effect of the electrostatic relaxation of the nearest-neighbor anions in response to the smaller size of Zn2+, and the bonding asymmetry due to surface truncation. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science B.V.

In the rural environment the influence of the forest fire on air quality could be easily detected; significantly higher NO2 and O3 concentrations were observed when air came from the direction of the forest fire area. Hourly NO2 and O3 concentration were 50-150% higher than the seasonal median values. The influence of the forest fire on air quality was also noticeable in the urban center even though local emissions are much higher than in the rural area.

These estimates are incorporated in recently developed stochastic simulation models used to describe the daily dynamics of dengue virus transmission in the urban environment. Water temperature estimates are provided through a regression model that includes meteorological variables not previously used; results show that they are significantly better than those used in previous dengue transmission models. Water depth models use a climatic water budget approach which estimates moisture storage within containers. The water depth models are less precise than those developed for water temperature; however, results are superior to those used in previous models. These new approaches should improve estimates of the impact of water conditions on dengue vectors.","Aedes aegypti; Climate-dengue modeling; Climatic water budget; Stepwise regression; Water depth; Water temperature","Aedes aegypti; Dengue virus; Dengue virus group; fresh water; Aedes; animal; article; climate; dengue; disease transmission; human; mosquito; regression analysis; statistics; temperature; virology; Aedes; Animals; Climate; Culicidae; Dengue; Fresh Water; Humans; Regression Analysis; Stochastic Processes; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032161727

There is an important role in the GCRP for the Developing world. A model is developed in which the Developing world contributes to the in-situ data programmes in exchange for an assured and un-interruptible supply of the sensor data and the products derived from them. These data are needed to perform research in environmental and the human dimensions of the global change. The research provides the basis to evaluate environmental policies in the light of the country's socio-economic and geo-political priorities, and to formulate new policy initiatives. Additionally, the data can be used for the exploration of natural resources, and other applications of public benefit. The model proposes that the Developing world should be partners in the US, European, Japanese, and Canadian programmes related to GCRP. This model is based on the non-transfer-of-funds in either direction, and offers a win-win opportunity for all partners. It consists of a network of centres of excellence in global change research and policy (CEGRP) throughout the Developing world, and the formation of a Developing world coordination group for global change (DWCG-GC). It describes the interfaces among the CEGRPs, the role of DWCG-GC, and their interaction with the rest of the international community. It is concluded that this cooperation with the Developing world will allow substantial cost savings for GCRP, enrich the research achievements and objectives of the programme, and promote the acceptance and implementation of the environmental policies that are meant to be the end result of GCRP effort.",,"climate change; developing world; international cooperation; remote sensing; research program; space technology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032430702

The synthetic estrogen 17α-ethinylestradiol (EE2), the antibiotic phenoxymethylpenicillin (Pen V), and the antineoplastic drug cyclophosphamide (CP) were chosen as modeling substances based on criteria of receptor specificity, elevated risk for human population groups for which the pharmaceuticals are not therapeutically intended, different modes of action, and prescription frequency. Attention has been focused on emissions from the use phase and subsequent diffuse release via the sewer systems. A reasonable worst-case environmental fate and human exposure were estimated using the software EUSES on worst-case emission quantities. The results indicate a negligible human risk connected to the environmental exposure for these substances.

The potential for feedback effects on possible changing climatic conditions through altered source/sink action for atmospheric CO2 is therefore an important issue in tundra regions. In this study we investigate environmental controls on CO2 evolution rates in Arctic soils through observations along a Eurasian transect of tundra sites and comparative experiments in northern Sweden and northeast Greenland. Among factors potentially controlling decomposition rates in Eurasian wet and mesic tundra temperature and depth of the water table significantly influenced the CO2 efflux, while thaw depth, soil nitrogen, and organic matter concentrations explained very little of the variation in fluxes. The minor importance of the soil N status in controlling decomposition rates was confirmed in experiments in which N and P was added in a factorial manner at a subarctic heath and a high-Arctic drained fen. Phosphorus decreased the CO2 emissions, while the combined N and P treatment increased the emissions in the subarctic. These effects were not reproduced in the high Arctic.

Based on these investigations it is concluded that the direction of the former abrading winds was mainly from the ESE, from the sector 105° ± 20° The ESE winds dominated during the deglaciation period, most probably in the period from 22 to 17 ka BP when first katabatic and later zonal winds from the shrinking Weichselian Ice Sheet abraded surfaces of boulders in the periglacial environment outside the ice margin. During the subsequent Holocene period westerly winds dominated in a temperate climate, as is the case today. Best preserved windpolish is primarily found on boulders in boulder concentrations whereas on he large erratic boulders the windpolish is often almost totally removed, owing to the many visitors climbing the boulders as well as weathering. Even on boulders transgressed by the sea for some time, windpolish has proved able to survive in low-energy littoral environments. This yields opportunities for reconstructing palaeo-wind directions in areas that are or have earlier been transgressed by the sea. Comparing the presented Danish palaeo-wind evidence with neighbouring parts of north-west Europe shows a regional variation in the wind regime, controlled by the extension of the Weichselian Ice Sheet. Dominating easterly palaeo-winds prevailed as katabatic and/or zonal winds in a narrow zone in front of the wind-controlling ice sheet during its maximum extension, and in some areas further to the east during the subsequent deglaciation. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001897714

Serv. and Technology, 1 Davids Close, Somersby, NSW 2250, Australia","Driven by legislative and community pressure, the energy, power and process industries are constantly being urged to improve the efficiency of their systems and significantly reduce the hazardous emissions from their facilities. To meet these challenges, but at the same time maintain a viable business, industries are seeking alternatives that enable them to comply with the emission constraints at minimum cost and with as few modifications as possible to their existing systems. For the last two decades, computational modelling has been emerging as a cost-effective, reliable and powerful tool for such applications. This paper demonstrates the capabilities of the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) approach in full-scale complex industrial systems. A number of alternative modifications for an existing 8 MW landfill-gas flare were simulated, and an optimised design was selected. Various turbulence and combustion models were used. Although the k-ε turbulence model failed to predict the flow pattern in inert-swirl flows, and to capture the flame characteristics in the reacting flows, a Reynolds stress model succeeded. The limitations in using the Eddy Break-Up (EBU) combustion model and a single global chemical reaction to simulate ignition, extinction, blow-off and lift-off phenomena are discussed. The CFD results provided detailed information on the flow structure, eg flow reversal, recirculation and swirl patterns, and also on flame stability and characteristics. The results were then used to provide guidance for selecting the most appropriate design. The full-scale flare was then modified, and its performance compared with the original design. The results of the numerical simulations of the flow and flame behaviours were found to be in good agreement with experimental observations. Overall, the final design provided a stable and confined flame over a wide range of operational conditions. Relative to the original design, the measurements of temperature and combustion products at the exit plane of the flare showed lower gas temperatures and significant reductions in emissions of CO (45%) and NO (60%).",,"Eddy break up combustion; Flame stability; Landfill gas flare; Reynolds stress model; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Cost effectiveness; Flow patterns; Ignition; Industrial applications; Land fill; Mathematical models; Reynolds number; Temperature measurement; Turbulence; Flame research",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032154999

The observed sequence of adsorbate and CO2 concentration profiles during the pulse reaction studies reveals that Rh+(CO)2 is an active adsorbate which reacts with adsorbed oxygen to form CO2. The observed transient behaviors of Rh+(CO)2, Rh-NO-, and CO2 during the pulse reactions can be explained by the proposed NO-CO reaction mechanism in which (i) Rh-NO- dissociates to form adsorbed nitrogen and oxygen and (ii) adsorbed oxygen further reacts with Rh+ (CO)2 to produce CO2. Addition of air to the NO-CO reactant stream produces a net-oxidizing environment for the NO-CO reaction. Adsorbed oxygen from air reacts with Rh-NO+ producing the nitrato species and providing more Rh sites for the NO-CO reaction at 473 K. At 573 K and above, adsorbed oxygen reacts with Rh+(CO)2 producing CO2, blocks the reduced Rh0 sites for Rh-NO-, oxidizes Rh0/Rh+ to Rh2+ sites, and inhibits the NO conversion and N2O formation. Rh sites are readily reduced and return to their initial state and the catalyst returns to its initial activity when air is withdrawn from the reactant stream. Preservation of the reduced Rh sites for Rh-NO- is required to maintain the catalyst activity for the NO-CO reaction under net-oxidizing conditions. © 1998 Academic Press.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002714993

The differences in CO2 emissions between countries are then analyzed by a decomposition method. The sources of differences in CO2 emissions are attributed to various factors such as different fuel efficiency, production techniques, consumption patterns and the size of the economy. It is argued that an industrial sector with high total emission intensity (TEI) can reduce pollution at lower cost than others with low TEI, assuming that the reduction in emissions entails reduction in output. In this connection, China provides a challenging case for a potential regional joint effort towards the CO2 reduction, because her emissions are shown to be the largest, both in the absolute term and in terms of average TEI.","Carbon emission; China; Industrial structure; Input-output analysis; Japan; Pollution source; South Korea","carbon emission; industrial structure; input-output analysis; pollutant source; China; Japan; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032450291

The oscillations are not chaotic but have a kinetic genesis. The oscillating behaviour is established over the pre-reduced catalyst after a transient phase whose duration is reduced with increasing the reactant inlet concentration. The addition of O2 to the feed reduces the average N2O conversion and does not substantially affect the frequency and the amplitude of the oscillations up to an O2/N2O inlet ratio equal to 10; only at higher inlet ratios do the oscillations disappear. Fourier analysis has revealed that the frequency of the oscillations increases by increasing either the feed flow rate or the N2O reactor inlet concentration.

Complete sequences of the mtDNA cytochrome b gene were obtained from 47 individuals of this group plus four vireonid outgroups. Mean levels of sequence divergence in the clade varied from 0.29% to 5.7%. Differences were greatest between V. flavifrons and four taxa of 'V. solitarius'. The latter separated into three taxonomic, geographical and ecological groups: V. plumbeus plumbeus, V. cassinii cassinii, and V. solitarius solitarius plus V. solitarius alticola. These differed by an average of 2.6-3.2%. Populations within each group revealed low levels of sequence variation (x̄ = 0.20%) and little geographical structuring. The mtDNA data generally corroborate results from allozymes. V. plumbeus shows a loss of yellow-green carotenoid pigmentation from the ancestral condition. The occupancy of relatively dry habitats by this species and V. cassinii represents a derived ecological shift from more-humid environments occupied by other species of vireonids. Ecological divergence in this clade occurred in allopatry and is associated with generic-level stability in morphometrics and foraging styles. Migratory behaviour and seasonal habitat shifts apparently evolved multiple times in vireos breeding in temperate environments. Present geographical and ecological distributions, and low levels of intrataxon genetic divergence, are hypothesized to be the result of postglacial regionalization of climate-plant associations and rapid northward expansion of breeding ranges.","Cytochrome b; Ecological diversification; Glaciation; Habitat shift; Molecular phylogeny; Vireo","cytochrome b; environment; migration; mitochondrial DNA; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; phenology; phylogeny; population genetics; Animals; Base Sequence; Cytochrome b Group; DNA Primers; DNA, Mitochondrial; Ecosystem; Enzymes; Evolution, Molecular; Genetics, Population; Molecular Sequence Data; Phenotype; Phylogeny; Seasons; Songbirds; Time Factors; United States; Variation (Genetics); Alticola; Aves; Vireo; Vireo cassinii cassinii; Vireo flavifrons; Vireo plumbeus plumbeus; Vireo solitarius alticola; Vireo solitarius solitarius; Vireonidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032191419

In the temperature range between 300 and 245 K almost no temperature dependence of the onset can be seen in the present study. In comparison to NO and CO where the onset is vertical the CO2 threshold behavior is less steep indicating that in the CO2 case a different type of transition must be responsible for the onset of the O- production.

The atomic charge on the carbonyl C was found to become more positive upon approach of the nucleophile; the density deformation maps suggest that the charge polarization occurs to a large extent in the π bond. Since this effect is not compensated for by charge transfer until in the late stage of addition, the reaction site is considerably electron deficient (more so than the carbonyl C in the substrate) for most of the reaction path, and its interactions with the ligands are dominated by hyperconjugation with the vicinal C-H and C-C bonds. Relative stabilities of the axial and equatorial transition-state structures were examined in the series HN=C, ON≡C-, N≡C-, FC≡C-, HC≡C-, SBeC≡C2-, O3SC≡C2-, H3AlC≡C2-, SC≡C2-, H3BC≡C2-, and C≡C2- and found to depend on polarization of the electrophiles, C=O vs C=S, and basicity of the nucleophiles. The latter dependence is parabolic: the axial preference reaches a maximum for the moderately basic anions, and it is diminished or even reversed for the most and least basic nucleophiles, i.e., in the case of reactions proceeding through the very early or very late transition states. Thus, the stereoelectronic effect is largest in the region of the reaction coordinate where the electron deficiency at the reaction site reaches a maximum. These findings corroborate the premises of the hypothesis of hyperconjugative assistance to bond formation and are consistent with major trends in the experimental data if the stereochemistry of alkylation of 4-tert-butylcyclohexanone is correlated with Pauling electronegativity of metals in the case of methylmetals, methylmetal ate complexes, allylmetals and arylmetals, and with the pKa of conjugated acids in the case of sulfur-, carbonyl-, and nitrile-stabilized carbanions.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0007742055

Total planktonic community respiration (O2 consumption and CO2 production) was best predicted by total phosphorus (TP), with respiratory rates increasing at higher TP levels. The bacterioplankton respiration alone was less well linked to nutrient concentrations. Yet, the rates of both planktonic and bacterial CO2 production changed similarly with changes in the C:N ratio, with the bacterial fraction, on average, contributing about 42% of the total planktonic respiratory rates. Bacterial carbon respired was uncoupled from oxygen consumption, with resultant average planktonic respiratory quotient (RQ) close to 2. Bacterioplankton respiratory rates are affected by a negative relationship between specific aerobic respiration and bacterial biomass. Higher bacterial specific oxygen consumption rates (μg O2 cell-1 d-1) were observed with increasing C:N and C:P ratios, suggesting an increase in maintenance cost at the low cell densities observed in oligotrophic waters. Phosphorus appeared as the limiting nutrient in these lakes and determined total planktonic respiratory rates, but epilimnetic bacterial respiration was mainly related to the DOC: nutrient ratios. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Bacterioplankton; Lakes; Nutrients; Respiration","bacterial metabolism; breathing; canada; phosphorus; bacterioplankton; lake; limiting factor; nutrient; respiration; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032460435

Melbourne Inst. of Technology, Melbourne, Vic., Australia","This study evaluates the sensitivity of ecosystem models to changes in the horizontal resolution of version 2 of the National Centre for Atmospheric Research Community Climate Model (CCM2). A previous study has shown that the distributions of natural ecosystems predicted by vegetation models using coarse resolution present-day climate simulations are poorly simulated. It is usually assumed that increasing the spatial resolution of general circulation models (GCMs) will improve the simulation of climate, and hence will increase our level of confidence in the use of GCM output for impacts studies. The principal goals of this study is to investigate this hypothesis and to identify which biomes are more affected by the changes in spatial resolution of the forcing climate. The ecosystem models used are the BIOME-1 model and a version of the Holdridge scheme. The climate simulations come from a set of experiments in which CCM2 was run with increasing horizontal resolutions. The biome distributions predicted using CCM2 climates are compared against biome distributions predicted using observed climate datasets. Results show that increasing the resolution of CCM2 produces a significant improvement of the global-scale vegetation prediction, indicating that a higher level of confidence can be vested in the global-scale prediction of natural ecosystems using medium and high resolution GCMs. However, not all biomes are equally affected by the increased spatial resolution, and although certain biome distributions are improved (e.g. hot desert, tropical seasonal forest), others remain globally poorly predicted even at high resolution (e.g. grasses and xerophytic woods. In addition, these results show that some climatic biased are enhanced with increasing resolution (e.g. in mountain ranges), resulting in the inadequate prediction of biomes.",,"circulation; Community Climate Model; ecosystem; ecosystem model; GCM; general circulation model; model sensitivity; spatial resolution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031697780

The vehicles were tandem axle trucks with GVW (gross vehicle weight) rating of 69,897 pounds. The primary use of these vehicles was for street collection and transporting the collected refuse to a landfill. West Virginia University Transportable Heavy Duty Emissions Testing Laboratories have been engaged in monitoring the tailpipe emissions from these trucks for seven-years. In the later years of testing the hydrocarbons were speciated for non-methane and methane components. Six of these vehicles employed the older technology (mechanical mixer) Cummins L-10 lean burn natural gas engines. Five trucks were equipped with electronically controlled Detroit Diesel Series 50 lean burn engines, while another five were powered by Caterpillar stoichiometric burn 3306 natural gas engines. The Caterpillar engines employed an exhaust oxygen sensor feedback and three way catalysts. Since the refuse haulers had automatic Allison transmissions, and since they were employed in stop-and-go city service, initial emissions measurements were made using the Central Business Cycle (SAE J1376) for buses, at 42,000 pound test weight. Some additional measurements were made using an ad hoc cycle that has been designed to be more representative of the real refuse hauler use that included several compaction cycles. The Cummins powered natural gas vehicles showed oxides of nitrogen and carbon monoxide emission variations typically associated with variable fuel mixer performance. In the first year of testing, the stoichiometric Caterpillar engines yielded very low emission levels, but in later years two of these refuse haulers had high carbon monoxide attributed to failure of the feedback system. For example, carbon monoxide on these two vehicles rose from 1.4 g/mile and 10 g/mile in 1995 to 144.9 g/mile and 57.8 g/mile in 1996. These stoichiometric engines were also less fuel efficient than their lean burn counterparts. The Detroit Diesel Series 50 powered refuse haulers produced high levels of oxides of nitrogen. However, it was found that changing the shifting patterns of the transmission lowered the oxides of nitrogen. All three engine types showed the potential for low emissions operation and the particulate matter reduction advantage offered by natural gas was evident from the results. © 1998 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Automobiles; Carbon monoxide; Diesel engines; Feedback; Gas emissions; Gas engines; Laboratories; Methane; Mixers (machinery); Natural gas; Natural gas fields; Refuse collection; Trucks; Allison transmissions; Carbon monoxide emissions; Emissions measurements; Emissions testing; Gross vehicle weight; Oxides of nitrogen; Particulate Matter; Three way catalysts; Natural gas vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072479550

Concerns over PM inventory make these engines attractive despite the loss of fuel economy associated with throttled operation. Early versions of the Cummins L-10 natural gas engines employed a mixer to establish air/fuel ratio. Emissions measurements by the West Virginia University Transportable Heavy Duty Emissions Testing Laboratories on Cummins L-10 powered transit buses revealed the potential to offer low emissions of PM and oxides of nitrogen, (NOx) but variations in the mixture could cause emissions of NOx, carbon monoxide and hydrocarbons to rise. This was readily corrected through mixer repair or readjustment. Newer versions of the L-10 engine employ a more sophisticated fueling scheme with feedback control from a wide range oxygen sensor. Comparative testing using the 5-mile route was performed in Sacramento, California on Class 8 tractors powered by these L-10 engines, operating on liquefied natural gas (LNG) and similar tractors with M-11 diesel engines. Also, using the CBD cycle, a fleet of Cummins L-10 compressed natural gas (CNG) powered buses in Garden City (Long Island), New York, was compared to a diesel-powered fleet in Cincinnati, Ohio. Data confirms the average low production of NOx and PM, but three higher NOx emitters were found in the Long Island fleet.

To address this interest and assess our current understanding of these issues, the Lunar and Planetary Institute hosted a 4-day Conference on Early Mars in Houston in April of 1997. The papers contained in this special section are a product of that meeting. The purpose of the conference was twofold: (1) to consider how impacts, volcanism, and the presence of abundant water affected the physical and chemical environment that existed on Mars 4 Gyr ago, particularly as it related to the nature of the global climate, the origin of the valley networks, the geologic and mineralogic evolution of the surface, the aqueous geochemistry of groundwater, and the existence of local environments that may have been conducive to the development of indigenous life and the preservation of its signature in the geologic record; and (2) to discuss what observations or experiments might he included in future spacecraft missions to test the ideas and expectations arising from purpose 1. While pertinent issues of early atmospheric and solar evolution were also addressed, the primary discussion at the conference focused on the evidence and constraints provided by the geologic records of Earth, the Moon, and Mars and analysis of the SNC meteorites. The papers contained in this special section span the full range of these topics, including the stability of the early atmosphere to erosion by the solar wind, the geologic environment from which the SNC meteorites originated, geomorphic evidence regarding the nature of the early Martian climate and hydrologic cycle, the potential impact of the past and present environment on the preserved signature of ancient life, and a discussion of the capabilities of a lander-based X ray diffraction and fluorescence instrument to assess the potential for past fossilization from the mineralogy of the current local surface environment. The issues raised at the conference, and by the papers included in this special section, will be the focus of ongoing attention as the intensity and scope of Mars exploration increases over the next decade.",,"article; astronomy; biology; geology; NASA Center ARC; NASA Discipline Exobiology; volcano; NASA Center ARC; NASA Discipline Exobiology; Evolution, Planetary; Exobiology; Geology; Mars; Meteoroids; Volcanic Eruption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032567260

The local thermal equilibrium (LTE) composition of the dissociated gas is connected to the electron impact collision cross sections of the species SF6, F2, F and S. The critical reduced electric field strength of the composition is determined by a balancing electron generation and loss modeled by chemical reactions evaluated by the electron energy distribution function (EEDF) derived from the Boltzmann transport equation. At room temperature, pure SF6 has a critical reduced electric field strength of 362 Td. With increasing temperature and decreasing density we found a small decrease of this value, whereas at temperatures higher than 1500 K, dissociation starts to decrease the dielectric strength of the composition. Furthermore, we found that generation of electrons by (associative) detachment from F- starts to play an important role at temperatures &gt; 2500 K, where the critical field strength still has a value of 118 Td. This value is found to decrease rapidly afterwards with increasing temperature to the value of 38 Td at 3000 K.

Sustained isothermal oscillations were observed in the form of periodic changes in the emission intensity from several planes present on the tip. An increase in emission, which was initiated on the Ir(510) plane, expanded to the (100) plane and then to surrounding stepped planes. In the following period, the emission from these bright planes decreased slowly, until the cycle began again. Interestingly, the three (100) areas of a [111]-oriented tip oscillated independently of one another.

However, the evidence &om animal studies to date indicates that emissions from vehicles operating on alternative fuels may pose less of a risk. As part of its efforts to reduce dependence on foreign oil and improve overall air quality, the U.S. Department of Energy has undertaken a major study of alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) which includes a comprehensive emissions testing program. The data collected thus far indicate that, for light-duty vehicles, the levels of regulated emissions from alternative fuel models are lower than those from their conventional he1 counterparts. Emissions of air toxics, as well as ozone forming potential, are also lower for the light-duty AFVs. The reductions in emissions from heavy-duty A F V s are greatest for particulate matter. The combination of these findings with results from recent medical studies suggests that communities having higher concentrations of AFVs may experience lower emissions-related risks of disease and human health disorders, and may ultimately realize reduced costs of medical care, lower individual insurance premiums, and a generally more favorable business climate. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The infiltration of the orbit by activated lymphocytes may explain the effectiveness of corticosteroid therapy. Scintigraphy with [111InDTPA-D-Phe1]-octreotide was recently used to reveal the presence of activated lymphocytes in foci of autoimmune diseases, because elevated amounts of somatostatin receptors are expressed in the surface of these cells. The aim of the current study was to evaluate whether the degree of orbital [111In-DTPA-D-Phe1] -octreotide uptake is able to predict the response to corticosteroid therapy in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy. Ten patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy entered the study. In all patients scintigraphy was performed, and subsequently, corticosteroid therapy (methylprednisolone, 1 g iv for 2 consecutive days a week for 6 weeks) was given. Clinical activity of Graves' ophthalmopathy was evaluated before and after treatment by calculating the ophthalmopathy index (OI). Planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) images of the head were obtained 24 h after the iv injection of 120-190 MBq of [111In-DTPA-D-Phe1]-octreotide. Radioligand uptake within each orbit (O) and brain (B) was measured using the region of interests (ROI) method and the O-to-B ratio was determined. According to the O-to-B ratio, the images were classified using the following three points score: 0 = O-to-B ratio ≤ 1; 1 = O-to-B ratio between 1 and 2.5; 2 = O-to-B ratio ≥2.5. The value of OI, measured before and after corticosteroid treatment, was correlated to the scintigraphic score. A significant change of OI was observed between posttreatment and pretreatment evaluation both in orbits with score 2 (OI: 15.4 ± 1.5 vs. 9.6 ± 0.5, P &lt; 0.005) and in those with score 1 or 0 (OI: 12.9 ± 1.5 vs. 11.5 ± 1.4, P &lt; 0.05) at the scintigraphy. However, when the OI was calculated excluding the changes in the soft tissue, which generally occur in all patients independently from the phase of the disease, a significant change of OI was observed only in the orbits with score 2 (OI: 12.9 ± 1.3 vs. 8.3 ± 0.5, P &lt; 0.01) but not in those with score 0 or 1 (OI: 11.2 ± 1.3 vs. 10.4 ± 1.3). In particular, 6 weeks after corticosteroid treatment, the patients with orbital score 2 at the scintigraphy had a significant improvement of soft tissue changes, proptosis, lagophthalmos, extraocular muscle movements impairment, and diplopia, whereas patients with score 0 or 1 had only a significant improvement of the soft tissue inflammation. In conclusion, the current preliminary data suggested that [111InDTPA-D-Phe1]-octreotide scintigraphy is able to predict the clinical response to corticosteroid treatment in patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy, and may be considered an useful approach to select the patients for the proper treatment.",,"corticosteroid; methylprednisolone; pentetreotide in 111; diagnostic agent; drug derivative; glucocorticoid; indium; octreotide; pentetic acid; SDZ 215 811; SDZ 215-811; adult; article; clinical article; clinical feature; corticosteroid therapy; disease classification; disease course; eye disease; female; Graves disease; human; intravenous drug administration; male; priority journal; prognosis; scintigraphy; scoring system; clinical trial; controlled study; Graves disease; middle aged; orbit; scintiscanning; treatment outcome; Adult; Female; Glucocorticoids; Graves Disease; Humans; Indium Radioisotopes; Male; Methylprednisolone; Middle Aged; Octreotide; Orbit; Pentetic Acid; Prognosis; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14444271577

A stand-alone version of SiB2 was used to simulate a grassland at Station 16 of the First ISLSCP Field Experiment (FIFE) located near Manhattan, Kansas, for a period of 142 days of the 1987 growing season. Modeled values of soil temperature and moisture were initialized, using field measurements from the soil profile, and thereafter updated solely by model calculations. The model was driven by half-hourly atmospheric observations and regular observations of canopy biophysics. This arrangement was intended to mimic model forcing in a GCM. Three model versions are compared: (i) a Control run using parameter values taken from look-up tables used for running the Colorado State University GCM; (ii) a Tuned run with many adjustments to optimize SiB2 to this ecosystem; and (iii) a Calibrated run, which calibrated the Control version soil to the local site and incorporated two important changes from the Tuned version. Modeled fluxes of latent heat, sensible heat, soil heat, net radiation, and net site CO2 were compared to over 800 half-hourly observations; modeled surface and deep soil temperatures compared to 6500 observations; and three layers of modeled soil water content compared to 15 measurements of the soil water profile. Statistical methods were used to analyze these results. In the absence of water stress all three versions accurately simulated photosynthesis and canopy conductance. However, during episodes of drought, only the Tuned and Calibrated versions accurately simulated physiological control of canopy fluxes. The largest errors were encountered in the simulation of soil respiration. These were traced to problems predicting water content and temperature in the soil profile. These results highlight the need for improved simulation of soil biophysics to obtain accurate estimates of net CO2 balance. The accuracy of the Tuned version was improved by changes that (i) allowed water extraction by roots from all soil layers, (ii) matched the soil texture specification to the site, and (iii) calibrated the expressions used for diffusion of water and heat within the soil profile.",,"Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric temperature; Computer simulation; Heat flux; Mathematical models; Moisture; Soil mechanics; Statistical methods; Temperature measurement; Water; Canopy biophysics; Canopy conductance; Soil respiration; Soil texture specification; Temperate grassland ecosystem; Vegetation; Ecosystems; boundary layer; carbon dioxide; energy flux; FIFE; grassland ecosystem; ISLSCP; moisture flux; soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer; USA, Kansas, Manhattan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032052368

Their role is particularly important in lowland tropical rain forests where rates of herbivory are higher, plants are better defended chemically and physically, and herbivores have specialized diets. In contrast to the temperate zone, most of the herbivory in the tropics occurs on ephemeral young leaves (&gt;70%), which requires herbivores to have finely tuned host-finding abilities. As a consequence of these tight ecological and evolutionary linkages, the interplay between plants and herbivores in the tropics may be more susceptible to perturbations of climate change. Increases in global temperature, atmospheric CO2, and the length of the dry season are all likely to have ramifications for plant/herbivore interactions in the tropics. Here I extrapolate from our current and incomplete understanding of the mechanisms regulating plant/herbivore interactions and present a scenario for possible trends under a changing climate. Although elevated CO2 tends to enhance plant growth rates, the larger effects of increased drought stress will probably result in lower growth. In atmospheres experimentally enriched in CO2, the nutritional quality of leaves declines substantially due to a dilution of nitrogen by 10-30%. This response is buffered in plant species associated with nitrogen fixers. Elevated CO2 should also cause a slight decrease in nitrogen-based defenses (e.g., alkaloids) and a slight increase in carbon-based defenses (e.g., tannins). The most dramatic and robust predicted effect of climate change is on rates of herbivory. Lower foliar nitrogen due to CO2 fertilization of plants causes an increase in consumption per herbivore by as much as 40%, and unusually severe drought appears to cause herbivore populations to explode. In areas where elevated CO2 is combined with drying, rates of herbivory may rise 2-4 fold. The frequency of insect outbreaks is also expected to increase. Higher herbivory should further reduce plant growth rates, perhaps favoring plant species that are well-defended or fix nitrogen. The predicted increase in the number of herbivores is primarily due to relaxed pressure from predators and parasitoids. Elevated temperatures may increase herbivore developmental times, affording them partial escape from discovery by natural enemies, and drought appears to decimate parasitoid populations. The expected decline in parasitoid numbers may be due to direct effects of dry season drought or to the relative scarcity of herbivores during that period. As a consequence, the relative abundance of species will change, and overall biodiversity should decline.",,"climate change; plant-herbivore interaction; rainforest; tropical forest",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031853536

All else being equal, C4 plants tend to be favored over C3 plants in warm humid climates and, conversely, C3 plants tend to be favored over C4 plants in cool climates. Empirical observations supported by a photosynthesis model predict the existence of a climatological crossover temperature above which C4 species have a carbon gain advantage and below which C3 species are favored. Model calculations and analysis of current plant distribution suggest that this pCO2-dependent crossover temperature is approximated by a mean temperature of 22°C for the warmest month at the current pCO2 (35 Pa). In addition to favorable temperatures, C4 plants require sufficient precipitation during the warm growing season. C4 plants which are predominantly graminoids of short stature can be competitively excluded by trees (nearly all C3 plants) - regardless of the photosynthetic superiority of the C4 pathway - in regions otherwise favorable for C4. To construct global maps of the distribution of C4 grasses for current, past and future climate scenarios, we make use of climatological data sets which provide estimates of the mean monthly temperature to classify the globe into areas which should favor C4 photosynthesis during at least 1 month of the year. This area is further screened by excluding areas where precipitation is &lt;25 mm per month during the warm season and by selecting areas classified as grasslands (i.e., excluding areas dominated by woody vegetation) according to a global vegetation map. Using this approach, grasslands of the world are designated as C3, C4, and mixed under current climate and pCO2. Published floristic studies were used to test the accuracy of these predictions in many regions of the world, and agreement with observations was generally good. We then make use of this protocol to examine changes in the global abundance of C4 grasses in the past and the future using plausible estimates for the climates and pCO2. When pCO2 is lowered to pre-industrial levels, C4 grasses expanded their range into large areas now classified as C3 grasslands, especially in North America and Eurasia. During the last glacial maximum (~18 ka BP) when the climate was cooler and pCO2 was about 20 Pa, our analysis predicts substantial expansion of C4 vegetation - particularly in Asia, despite cooler temperatures. Continued use of fossil fuels is expected to result in double the current pCO2 by sometime in the next century, with some associated climate warming. Our analysis predicts a substantial reduction in the area of C4 grasses under these conditions. These reductions from the past and into the future are based on greater stimulation of C3 photosynthetic efficiency by higher pCO2 than inhibition by higher temperatures. The predictions are testable through large-scale controlled growth studies and analysis of stable isotopes and other data from regions where large changes are predicted to have occurred.","C4; Climate change; CO2; Grassland; Photosynthesis","C4 grass; carbon dioxide; climate; global distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031808919

This paper reports our continuing studies of this important catalyst system, discussing both steady state and transient kinetics, and relating these to the mechanism of reaction, and in particular the possible role of small, ionic copper clusters. We have studied the kinetics of reaction and determined the turnover numbers of a series of otherwise identical catalysts with different copper contents. The turnover number is roughly constant at copper contents < ca 90% exchange, and then increases by about a factor of two at 100% exchange, remaining constant up to the highest nominal extent of exchange studied, ca 160%. These results suggest that both isolated copper ions and small metal/oxygen clusters, including dimers, catalyse the SCR reaction, with the dimeric species being roughly twice as active per copper ion. In earlier studies we have drawn attention to the possible catalytic importance of hydrocarbon deposits, which can be formed on the catalysts at temperatures of ca 600 K or lower, and we now report non-steady-state results for catalysts with different copper loadings. For each catalyst it was found that a similar amount of reactive deposit was formed, and that it decomposed NO according to rather straightforward kinetics. Significant differences in reactivity were however noted, with the rate of reaction reaching a maximum at 680 K on catalysts with 100% degree of copper exchange, compared to almost 100 K higher for 54% exchanged materials.

Div., C., Gaithersburg, MD 20899, United States","The distributions of stable isotopes in trace atmospheric species are controlled mainly by the isotopic compositions of precursor molecules and isotope fractionation effects during production and removal of the species. Distributions of radioactive isotopes are controlled mainly by the isotopic compositions of precursor molecules and radioactive decay processes. As a result, through their isotopic compositions, atmospheric species are traceable to sources and sinks. Thus, isotopic compositions provide useful information for estimating source strengths and for understanding the importance of removal processes in the cycling of the species. The use of radioactive 14C and the stable isotopes (13C and 18O) are reviewed here for understanding production and removal processes of CO in the troposphere. Carbon monoxide is a critical component in atmospheric chemistry because of its large effect on levels of OH, the principal oxidant in the atmosphere. In the troposphere, this is due to relatively high concentrations of CO and a short lifetime (2-4 months). Initially, 14CO measurements were instrumental in estimating accurately the tropospheric lifetime. Since seasonal 14CO variation is controlled largely by OH, 14CO serves as an important surrogate measure of tropospheric OH. Global 14CO measurements have also been used to estimate the biogenic component of the global CO budget, specifically contributions from biomass burning, oxidized non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) emissions, oceans and plants. Research using 14CO measurements is also active in quantifying fossil and non-fossil urban emissions. Kinetic isotopic fractionation during production of 13CO and C18O from reduced precursors allows one to distinguish, at least qualitatively, different varieties of CO based on seasonal tropospheric isotopic measurements. Difficulties in interpreting the stable isotopic record arise from large fractionation effects that obscure source isotopic signatures (in particular the oxygen kinetic isotope effect for the CO + OH reaction), and large seasonal/latitudinal variability in source fluxes. While dual-isotopic CO source signatures do not allow a direct mathematical determination of contributions from several sources, plots of δ18O vs δ13C may help estimate relative proportions of dominant sources. In addition to understanding CO sources, the pressure dependence of the carbon kinetic isotope effect (KIE) has helped elucidate pathways for the CO + OH reaction. Since formaldehyde (HCHO) is an important intermediate in hydrocarbon oxidation to CO and CO2, the stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in atmospheric HCHO may help distinguish different hydrocarbon sources to regional CO budgets and elucidate the importance of different oxidative reaction pathways.","Carbon-13; Carbon-14; Isotope fractionation; Kinetic isotope effect; Oxygen-18","Kinetic isotope effect; Atmospheric composition; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Fractionation; Hydrocarbons; Oxidation; Pressure effects; Radioisotopes; Reaction kinetics; Troposphere; Atmospheric chemistry; carbon 13; carbon 14; carbon monoxide; hydroxyl radical; oxygen 18; atmospheric chemistry; carbon monoxide; isotopic composition; troposphere; air monitoring; air pollution; article; fractionation; priority journal; troposphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032146951

This is in striking contrast to Lu-, Y-, and Gd-based oxyorthosilicates, which are characterized by very strong Ce3+ emission. The absence of luminescence in YbSO is due to quenching of the Ce3+ emission via an [Yb2+-Ce4+] charge-transfer mechanism. Extremely weak band emission observed in YbSO is attributed to transitions connecting the (Yb2+-h+) charge-transfer state to the two levels of the Yb2+ 4f13 configuration. Optical absorption shows the usual bands due to Ce3+ absorption with a band edge near 260 nm. The RL emission spectrum consists of a well-resolved band near 500 nm and an additional band in the region 260-300 nm. The exact position of the latter band cannot be determined due to concomitant Ce3+ absorption. At room temperature the YbSO RL emission is ca. six orders of magnitude weaker than Lu2SiO5 : Ce (LSO) emission. Maximum intensity in the interval 8-300 K occurs near 40 K and is ca. four orders of magnitude weaker than LSO emission. The YbSO band emission is thermally quenched with increasing temperature (40-300 K), consistent with classical theory predictions. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Seasonal variability in the ocean surface saturation state of carbon dioxide has been quantified from the two resultant P(CO2) time series. The large scale seasonal changes in a broad region of the mid-Atlantic are consistent with the thermodynamic change in P(CO2) due to seasonal temperature fluctuation. However, to the north and east of the region studied the P(CO2) variation was in antiphase to the temperature signal, due to deep winter mixing and spring-summer biological activity. Large variations in oceanic P(CO2) were also observed on relatively small spatial scales, particularly in coastal and shelf waters, where the effects of phytoplankton activity are more obvious than in the open ocean.

Since there is no general agreement in locating this region within a global temperature-based climatic scheme, classifying temperatures regimes using cluster analysis can lead to a better understanding of the Patagonian climate. Working with 14-year long series of daily temperature data in 21 weather-stations south of 40°S, an average linkage clustering is presented within the matrix of correlation among the departures from the monthly temperature averages. Four clusters were identified at the r = 0.55 level, the mapping of which is consistent with some ecoclimatic boundaries. This was an unexpected result as deviations rather than actual temperature levels were employed to perform the clustering. Also, the two major clusters adopted a zonal disposition regardless of the main climatic division in Patagonia, i.e. west-east. In this way it is shown that this orography-induced boundary, a merely rain-dependent with little consequence to the temperature regime. Standard deviation of mean annual temperature was also mapped as a complementary tool to depict the oceanic-continental continuum in the area, upon which no unfirom criterion exists. Finally, the weather-station that best reflects the interannual variation of temperature was identified in each one of the two main clusters.

Reductions in the N concentration of leaf litter have been found for tree species raised under elevated CO2, with reduction in N concentration ranging from ca. 50% for sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa) to 19% for sycamore (Acer platanoides). However, the effects of elevated CO2 on the chemical composition of litter has been investigated only for a limited number of species. There is also little information on the effects of increased CO2 on the quality of root tissues. If we consider, for example, two important European forest ecosystem types, the dominant species investigated for chemical changes are just a few. Thus, there are whole terrestrial ecosystems in which not a single species has been investigated, meaning that the observed effects of a raised CO2 level on plant litter actually has a large error source. Few reports present data on the effects of elevated CO2 on litter nutrients other than N, which limits our ability to predict the effects of elevated CO2 on litter quality and thus on its decomposability. In litter decomposition three separate steps are seen: (i) the initial stages, (ii) the later stages, and (iii) the final stages. The concept of ""substrate quality,"" translated into chemical composition, will thus change between early stages of decomposition and later ones, with a balanced proportion of nutrients (e.g., N, P, S) being required in the early decomposition phase. In the later stages decomposition rates are ruled by lignin degradation and that process is regulated by the availability of certain nutrients (e.g., N, Mn), which act as signals to the lignin-degrading soil microflora. In the final stages the decomposition comes to a stop or may reach an extremely low decomposition rate, so low that asymptotic decomposition values may be estimated and negatively related to N concentrations. Studies on the effects of changes in chemical composition on the decomposability of litter have mainly been made during the early decomposition stages and they generally report decreased litter quality (e.g., increased C/N ratio), resulting in lower decomposition rates for litter raised under elevated CO2 as compared with control litter. No reports are found relating chemical changes induced by elevated CO2 to litter mass-loss rates in late stages. By most definitions, at these stages litter has turned into humus, and many studies demonstrated that a raising of the N level may suppress humus decomposition rate. It is thus reasonable to speculate that a decrease in N levels in humus would accelerate decomposition and allow it to proceed further. There are no experimental data on the long-term effect of elevated CO2 levels, and a decrease in the storage of humus and nutrients could be predicted, at least in temperate and boreal forest systems. Future works on the effects of elevated CO2 on litter quality need to include studies of a larger number of nutrients and chemical components, and to cover different stages of decomposition. Additionally, the response of plant litter quality to elevated CO2 needs to be investigated under field conditions and at the community level, where possible shifts in community composition (i.e., C3 versus C4 ; N2 fixers versus nonfixers) predicted under elevated CO2 are taken into account.","Carbon dioxide; Chemical composition; Climate change; Decomposition; Plant litter; Substrate quality","Acer; Acer platanoides; Castanea sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002189219

The atmospheric model is a precursor to version 3 of the Community Climate Model developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research. It interacts with a mechanistic parameterization of the land surface at each time step. Photosynthesis and respiration fluxes are calculated at each time step and are linked to the tracer transport scheme that advects CO2 through the model atmosphere. For the first time in atmospheric CO2 modeling, these two fluxes are not forced to balance annually at each grid point. The model was run for 10 years with climatological sea surface temperatures, and the results were saved as monthly means. In this paper, an average year is calculated from the output of the 10 year run and then evaluated in terms of mean distributions and seasonal cycles. The model reproduces many of the observed features of the atmospheric CO2 distribution although there are discrepancies in some areas. The seasonality of tropical carbon exchange is exaggerated which leads to unrealistic CO2 near the equator. Carbon uptake is too strong at high northern latitudes in the boreal summer which results in a spurious annual carbon sink and exaggerated seasonal CO2 cycle amplitudes at these latitudes. The annual sink strongly affects the simulated interhemispheric CO2 gradient. Errors in the temperature and precipitation simulation cause anomalies in the CO2 field in specific regions such as the United States and India.

I examine the impact of growth specifically on air quality in California. In recent decades, California has suffered from notoriously polluted air and has experienced rapid population growth. Despite the population growth, air quality actually has improved since the early 1980s due to aggressive regulatory efforts. Using data for 56 counties, I analyze the contribution of population growth to trends in atmospheric emissions of five regulated pollutants from 1980 to 1990, controlling for trends in per capita income and regulatory efforts. The analysis is disaggregated by source of emissions and demonstrates that population growth is strongly associated with some sources of emissions but not with others. Thus, the overall impact of population growth depends upon the composition of production and consumption activities in each county. I also explore whether the trend in number of households predicts better than the trend in number of persons, and whether the impact of population growth depends upon the age structure or source of growth (immigration or domestic increase).

In the Pd3 + H2 system, Pd3, like Pd2, activates H2 without barrier. For the activation of the C-H bond in CH4 with Pd3, although the final products are found to be similar in energy compared to the case of Pd2, the activation barriers on Pd3 are much higher than those on Pd2. This difference has been explained in terms of the large repulsion from the s1d9 configurations of Pd atoms in Pd3, whereas Pd atoms in Pd2 adopt mainly the less repulsive d10 configuration. In the case of Pt3 + H2/CH4, the reactions basically follow the same pattern as in the Pt2 systems.

Highly concentrated polymer electrolytes based on poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and LiI, with EO/Li ratio ≤ 3, were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) and 7Li solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) methods. The effect of 15-nm particle size Al2O3 additives and in several cases, other constituents ethylene carbonate and poly(methylmethacrylate) on structure and Li+ ion environment was explored. The addition of Al2O3 suppresses the formation of crystalline phases, including free LiI, which is present in EO/Li= 1.5 samples without Al2O3. The conductivity jump observed in these concentrated electrolytes at around 80°C is correlated with an NMR-observed transition to a Li+ environment which is similar to that of free ions in a molten phase.","Lithium iodide; Lithium-7 NMR; Nano-crystalline alumina; Poly(ethylene oxide); Polymer electrolytes","Alumina; Composition effects; Differential scanning calorimetry; Electric conductivity of solids; Lithium compounds; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Particle size analysis; Polycarbonates; Polyelectrolytes; Polyethylene oxides; Polymethyl methacrylates; X ray powder diffraction; Lithium iodide; Polyethylene carbonate; Solid electrolytes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032003659

A camera installed on the boiler top casing supplies instantaneous information on the combustion conditions on the grate. In the event of undesired changes in firing position or firing length, countermeasures may be instituted immediately. A control system based on fuzzy logic, divided into several stage each of which includes a short-term and a long-term strategy, has been developed for this purpose. This system reduces fluctuations during combustion to an unavoidable minimum. The acoustic temperature measurement system installed in the first pass of the boiler provides valuable information about the temperature distribution in the zone. This allows the control room operator to adjust the distribution of secondary air to the front and rear row of nozzles so that uniform temperature and flow distribution are maintained at all times. Both installations allow the firing system to operate at more optimized conditions which results in such positive effects as reduced emissions and increased steam production.",,"Boiler firing; Cameras; Combustors; Fuzzy control; Fuzzy sets; Process control; Temperature distribution; Thermography (imaging); Thermography (temperature measurement); Waste disposal; Acoustic temperature measurement; Municipal waste combustors (MWC); Waste incineration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032274174

The aim of this study was to define, using a bench test, an optimal protocol for long-term use, and to assess the efficacy of this technique in neonates. Design: A bench test with an artificial lung model, and an observational prospective study. Dead space wash-out was performed by continuous tracheal gas insufflation (CTGI), via six capillaries molded in the wall of a specially designed endotracheal tube, in 30 preterm neonates with hyaline membrane disease. Setting: Neonatal intensive care unit of a regional hospital. Results: The bench test study showed that a CTGI flow of 0.5 l/min had the optimal efficacy-to-side-effect ratio, resulting in a maximal or submaximal efficacy (93 to 100%) without a marked increase in tracheal and CTGI circuit pressures. In the 30 newborns, 15 min of CTGI induced a significant fall in arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2), from 45 ± 7 to 35 ± 5 mmHg (p = 0.0001), and in 14 patients allowed a reduction in the gradient between Peack inspirating pressure and positive end-expiratory pressure from 20.8 ± 4.6 to 14.4 ± 3.7 cmH2O (p &lt; 0.0001) while keeping the transcutaneous partial pressure of carbon dioxide constant. As predicted by the bench test, the decrease in PaCO2 induced by CTGI correlated well with PaCO2 values before CTGI (r = 0.58, p &lt; 0.002) and with instrumental dead space-to-tidal volume ratio (r = 0.54, p &lt; 0.005). Conclusion: CTGI may be a useful adjunct to conventional ventilation in preterm neonates with respiratory disease, enabling an increase in CO2 clearance or a reduction in ventilatory pressure.","Barotrauma; Dead space washout; Mechanical ventilation; Newborns; Very-low-birthweight","aeration; arterial carbon dioxide tension; article; artificial ventilation; clinical article; clinical trial; endotracheal tube; expired air; flow rate; human; hyaline membrane disease; inspiratory capacity; lung dead space; lung model; newborn; newborn mortality; pump; spirometry; transcutaneous carbon dioxide monitoring; valve; Artificial Organs; Blood Gas Analysis; Blood Gas Monitoring, Transcutaneous; Carbon Dioxide; Humans; Hyaline Membrane Disease; Infant, Newborn; Insufflation; Linear Models; Lung; Oxygen Inhalation Therapy; Positive-Pressure Respiration; Predictive Value of Tests; Prospective Studies; Respiratory Dead Space; Trachea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031737460

The parameters have been adjusted to reproduce the experimental enthalpies of vaporization and vapor pressures or densities of a set of nine alkanes in the liquid state at 298 K (or at the boiling point in the case of methane), using a cutoff radius for the van der Waals interactions of 1.6 nm. Force fields to be used in molecular simulations are bound to the conditions chosen for their parametrization, for example, the temperature, the densities of the systems included in the calibration set, or the cutoff radius used for the nonbonded interactions. Van der Waals parameters for the CHn united atoms of earlier GROMOS force fields were developed using a cutoff radius of 0.8 nm for the van der Waals interactions. Because the van der Waals interaction energy between aliphatic groups separated by distances between 0.8 and 1.4 nm is not negligible at liquid densities, the use of these parameters in combination with longer cutoffs leads to an overestimation of the attractive van der Waals interaction energy. The relevance of this excess attraction depends on the size of the groups that are interacting, as well as on their local densities. Free energies of hydration have been calculated for five alkanes. © 1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.","Force field parametrization; GROMOS96; Liquid alkanes; Molecular dynamics; Van der Waals interactions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001751804

In 1947, the Los Angeles County Air Pollution Control District was formed to deal with the growing smog problem, which was caused by a combination of poor atmospheric ventilation, strong solar radiation, confining topography, and generally uncontrolled pollutant emissions. In the early to mid 1950s, the basis of photochemical smog theory was set forth by Professor Arie J. Haagen-Smit of the California Institute of Technology, who concluded that ozone and other photochemical oxidants were not emitted directly, but were formed in the atmosphere when precursor emissions of oxides of nitrogen and hydrocarbons reacted with each other in the presence of sunlight. Beginning in 1959, the State of California moved to control vehicle emissions, passing a series of acts which culminated in the formation of the California Air Resources Board in 1967. On the federal level, congress passed the first Clean Air Act in 1963, with subsequent major amendments added in the 1970 Act (which also established the Environmental Protection Agency), and the 1990 Act. Although some controls had been required on motor vehicles in the 1960s, it was not until 1975 that the first catalytic converters, designed to reduce emissions of hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide appeared, with the three way catalyst (to also control oxides of nitrogen) being introduced on 1981 model vehicles. In 1976, recognizing the regional nature of photochemical smog, the four local agencies of the Greater Los Angeles region combined to form the South Coast Air Quality Management District. In the Los Angeles region, ozone concentrations showed a moderate overall decline from the late 1950s to the late 1970s, and have declined substantially from the late 1970s until the present time, even in the face of large increases in population and vehicle miles traveled. Ozone trends for the period 1986-95 are also presented for several major cities in the United States. Also discussed are current trends to incorporate market forces in the control of pollutant emissions, and the future outlook for reducing pollutant emissions still further by a combination of technological and educational means. © 1998 Elsevier B.V.

Emissions of nitric oxide (NO) from the soils of this region are poorly known. In this study, we adapt the CASA model of terrestrial-ecosystem productivity and trace-gas emissions to make spatially gridded, monthly estimates of NO emissions from soils for a nine-state region of the southeastern United States. Gridded input data layers to the model include temperature, precipitation, solar surface radiation, soil texture, land cover, fertilizer sales by county, and normalized-difference vegetation index. Total N gas emissions are modeled as proportional to the rates of gross N mineralization and fertilizer N input. The relative proportional emissions of NO, N2O, and N2 are determined by soil water content. The model estimates 126 x 109 g NO-N/yr emitted from soils for the entire nine-state area. Agricultural soils emit two-thirds of the total but cover only ~17% of the land area. Highest NO emissions occur along the cultivated Mississippi River corridor, southern Alabama-Georgia, and the Carolina coastal plain. Simulated emissions fall within the range of commonly reported values for temperate forests and cultivated fields, and the regional estimates are probably accurate within a factor of 2. Compared to NO(x) emissions from industrial, transportation, and utility sectors, soil emissions are ~10% of total regional emissions. However, the soil source could be a significant fraction of local NO(x) in rural agricultural areas, where emissions from fertilized fields usually range from 300 to 900 mg NO-N·m-2·yr-1. Fertilizer management could be an effective O3-abatement strategy in some rural agricultural areas, although this possibility and general uncertainties in the soil source of NO should not be grounds to delay other O3-abatement strategies for the much larger, nonsoil NO(x) sources in the region.","Agriculture; Air pollution; Fertilizer use and management; Modeling NO emissions from soils; Nitric oxide emissions from soils; Nitrogen fertilization in agriculture; Ozone; Soil emission of NO; Southeastern United States; Tropospheric ozone precursors, sources","modeling; nitric oxide; soil emission; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031828852

Patterns and mechanisms observed over 25 years in a large kelp forest suggest that definition of a meaningful benchmark is impossible, because many of the large animals have been gone for years to decades, and kelps are sensitive to large-scale, low-frequency El Nino-Southern Oscillation events and longer term regime shifts. A shift in the oceanographic climate has significantly reduced the average size and carrying capacity of the dominant plant. The animals that have been functionally removed from the community include sea otters, black sea bass, yellowtail, white sea bass, and abalones. Other species are still present, but fisheries have had huge effects on the abundances, size-frequencies, and/or spatial distributions of sheephead, kelp bass, rays, flatfish, rock fish, spiny lobsters, and red sea urchins. Now even sea cucumbers, crabs, and small snails are subject to unregulated fishing. The plants continue to exist without a hint of the effects of the loss of so much animal biomass. Furthermore, most of the megafauna have been removed with very little documentation or historical understanding of what the natural community was like. Thus, our ability to separate anthropogenic impacts from the 'natural' dynamics of the system is severely compromised. We discuss the importance of both an ecosystem focus on productivity and careful monitoring of as many populations as possible. In addition, we show that this community is not tightly integrated with mutual dependencies; hence, many species can be removed without much affecting the rest of the ecosystem.","Baseline; Benchmark; Biodiversity; Climate; Elasmobranchs; Fish; Fishing; Kelp; Regim e shift; Trends","community structure; environmental factor; human impact; kelp forest; trend detection",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031960256

The samples were characterized by chemical analysis, including carbon monoxide reduction and CrVI extraction with sodium hydroxide or water, and by XRPD, UV-Vis DRS and ESR. Several Cr species were identified, namely CrVI, CrV (ESR γ-signal), CrIII (ESR δ-signal), small CrIII oxide clusters (ESR β-signal) and α-chromia. The relative abundance of these Cr species was found to be mainly controlled by the specific support employed and the Cr concentration. The catalytic activity in the isobutane dehydrogenation was studied at 723 and 773 K in a flow microreactor. It was found that the activity per total Cr atom was markedly higher for the zirconia-based catalysts compared with the other two systems in all the explored Cr concentration range. That is, the CrOx/ZrO2 interaction maintains its positive effect well beyond the monolayer capacity of this support. Moreover, the catalytic activity correlated with the amount of high-oxidation state chromium (CrVI and CrV), evaluated by the quantity of extractable Cr or by the consumption of carbon monoxide in the catalyst reduction. The larger concentration of mononuclear CrV species on zirconia, confirmed here, is thought to be responsible for the higher activity of the zirconia-based catalysts, through reduction to active mononuclear CrIII species under reaction conditions. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.","Alkane dehydrogenation; Chromia on alumina; Chromia on silica; Chromia on zirconia",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001564954

In this context, federal, regional and municipal legislation relevant for GHG emissions is examined in Canada, the USA and Germany. Regarding the first question, different national governments find themselves in considerably different positions to implement climate initiatives at subnational levels, with the Gentian government in the strongest position and the Canadian government in the weakest. The implications of this for a nation's willingness to adopt emission reduction targets could be serious. Regarding the second question, there are few significant differences among Canadian, US and German municipalities' jurisdictional capabilities (and limitations) to reduce GHG emissions. Though limited in their legal capacity, these municipalities demonstrate that through their own, often informal, initiatives they can reinforce and compliment the more formal, regulatory actions by senior-level governments, thereby paving the way for senior-level governments to deliver meaningful domestic emission reductions. © 1998 Carfax Publishing Ltd.",,"emissions control; environmental legislation; greenhouse gas; legislative approach; urban area; Canada; Germany; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031760777

Carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NOx), non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from these NGVs are compared to control vehicles operating on reformulated gasoline. This study applies an analysis of covariance model that takes into account emissions deterioration and individual vehicle variability. Our results suggest that NGVs are generally cleaner than conventional vehicles; however, in the case of NOx and NMHC, emissions benefits are reduced over the lifetime of the vehicle due to higher NGV emissions deterioration rates.",,"Alternative fuel vehicles; Clean fuel vehicle; Non methane hydrocarbon; Carbon dioxide; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Natural gas; Nitrogen oxides; Synthetic fuels; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032256830

Baseline projections show US transport sector GHG emissions increasing over the 1990 level 28% by 2010 and 58% by 2030. The combined impacts of the policies analysed would be substantial emission reductions that grow over time, with GHG emissions returned to the 1990 level by 2010 and cut to 35% lower by 2030.

Our methodology can be applied to a wide range of environmental policy questions with a spatial dimension characterized by interdependencies across policy instruments and environmental processes. Improvements in vehicle technology are important for meeting air quality standards. Triggering such changes through economic instruments is attractive because this accommodates the geographical variation of air quality problems throughout the European Union.

Mesocosm studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of 'Arabian light' crude oil contamination on coastal bacterioplanktonic communities. After oil addition, regular surveys of the bacterial changes of the oil-contaminated seawater were performed during 5-week periods during the austral summer of 1992/1993 and 1993/1994. All results (total, saprophytic and hydrocarbon-utilising bacterial abundance) clearly revealed a significant response of Antarctic bacterial communities to hydrocarbon contamination. A 1 order of magnitude increase of bacterial microflora occurred in seawater after crude oil contamination.

This earlier study, which assessed custodians’ exposures to carbon monoxide during burnisher use, was repeated using burnishers retrofitted with emission controls consisting of self-aspirating catalytic mufflers and computerized air/fuel monitors and alarms. Realtime carbon monoxide detectors with datalogging capabilities were placed on the burnishers in the breathing zones of operators during burnisher use. Carbon monoxide levels were recorded every 30 seconds. Ventilation and physical characteristics of the spaces of burnisher use were characterized, as were burnisher maintenance practices. Thirteen burnishing events were monitored under conditions comparable to previously published monitoring. All carbon monoxide exposures were well below even the most conservative recommended limits from the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygjenists. Average maximum peak exposures were reduced 91 percent, from 235 ± 106 ppm before emission controls to 20 ± 14 ppm. Average maximum short-term 15-minute exposures and mean time-weighted average exposures during burnisher use were reduced 96 percent, from 136 ± 51 to 6 ± 4 ppm and from 125 ± 47 to 5 ± 3 ppm, respectively. Potential failures of the emission controls were also identified and included air filter blockage, spark plug malfunction, and faulty alarm function design. While the addition of emission controls significandy reduces the carbon monoxide exposure risk, the burnishers are still capable of producing excessive carbon monoxide emissions under these aforementioned conditions, and carbon monoxide may accumulate to unsafe levels when burnishers are used in areas with inadequate ventilation. Recommendations for safe use are provided. Use of electric burnishers is advised if guidance is not strictly followed or later proves inadequate. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

To describe axial voidage profiles, a model which calculates the bed density as an exponential function of the bed height is used. The bed is divided into a dense region at the bottom where gas and solids are perfectly mixed and a dilute zone above considered as a plug flow. The model includes devolatilization of waste particles, combustion of char and volatile matters, acid gas recapturing by calcium, NO and N2O formation and reduction by homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions. The impact of different operating parameters (temperature, excess air, calcium addition, waste moisture and air stagement) was studied and the results of calculations were compared with the emissions measured on a CFB pilot plant of 10 cm i.d. and 4 m height.

The first is called Bootstrap, and is based on the method of successive approximations. The second is called Simplefit, and utilizes a curve-fitting procedure based on the simplex method. Both are able to provide numerical estimates of the number of crystals as a function of time, to better than 2% accuracy, in the presence of significant noise. The advantage of the algorithms is that they produce accurate output under conditions where standard methods fail. In particular, the number of crystals versus time can be determined even when crystal growth switches from interfacial control to diffusion control on the timescale of measurements. The efficacy of the algorithms is demonstrated on two real systems, namely the nucleation of zinc on carbon, and the nucleation of lead on carbon. In both cases non-steady states of nucleation are readily observed in the presence of time-varying crystal growth rates. In addition, a new phenomenon is seen for which the name ""nucleation persistence"" is suggested. This is the transient continuation of a high rate of nucleation after a rapid decrease in overpotential. The phenomenon is attributed to the slow readjustment of the size distribution of microscopic nuclei on the electrode surface. Interestingly, the existence of nucleation persistence invalidates the double potential step technique, which has previously been regarded as the standard method for observing electrochemical nucleation and growth. Finally, the mathematical theory of nucleation persistence is briefly sketched.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748585185

Detailed models are needed to understand the complex interaction of transport and kinetics occurring in these reactors. In this work, the partial oxidation of methane on rhodium is studied numerically as an example of short contact time reactor modeling. A tube wall catalytic reactor, which serves to model a single pore or channel of the monolithic catalyst, is simulated. The simulation is carried out using a fully two-dimensional flowfield description, which is coupled with a detailed surface reaction model. The catalyst is characterized by its temperature and coverages of adsorbed species, which vary in the flow direction. The simulation offers a detailed description of the complex interaction between mass and heat transfer as well as chemistry. At the catalyst entrance, an extremely rapid variation of temperature, velocity, and transport coefficients is found. The competition between complete and partial methane oxidation is explained using the calculated surface coverages whereby CO2 and H2O are formed in the entrance region of the catalytic reactor. Methane conversion as well as H2 and CO selectivity are found to increase with increasing temperature. Increasing reactor pressure reduces methane conversion, although the syngas selectivity decreases only slightly.",,"Catalysis; Catalysts; Catalytic converters; Gas adsorption; Heat transfer; Mass transfer; Mathematical models; Methane; Oxidation; Reaction kinetics; Rhodium; Synthesis gas; Catalytic combustion; Catalytic reactors; Combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032272669

For an individual, fully expanded leaf, the model predicts that the fast-turnover labile C, starch and protein pools are driven into an approximate or moving steady state that is proportional to the average leaf absorbed irradiance on a time-scale of days to weeks, even under realistic variable light conditions, in qualitative agreement with general patterns of leaf acclimation to light observed both temporally within the growing season and spatially within plant canopies. When the fast-turnover pools throughout the whole plant (including stems and roots) also follow this moving steady state, the model predicts that the time-averaged whole-plant net primary productivity is proportional to the time-averaged canopy absorbed irradiance and to gross canopy photosynthesis, and thus suggests a mechanistic explanation of the observed approximate constancy of plant light-use efficiency (LUE) and carbon-use efficiency. Under variable light conditions, the fast-turnover pool sizes and the LUE are predicted to depend negatively on the coefficient of variation of irradiance. We also show that the LUE has a maximum with respect to the fraction of leaf labile C allocated to leaf protein synthesis (a(lp)), reflecting a trade-off between leaf photosynthesis and leaf respiration. The optimal value of a(lp) is predicted to decrease at elevated [CO2](a), suggesting an adaptive interpretation of leaf acclimation to CO2. The model therefore brings together a number of empirical observations within a common mechanistic framework.","Carbon-use efficiency; CO2 acclimation; Light acclimation; Light-use efficiency; Model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031825286

We propose a model to explain this. We assume that the fast wind, blown by the central star of A30, carries a very weak magnetic field. The interaction of this wind with a cluster of dense condensations traps the magnetic field lines for a long time and stretches them, leading to a strong magnetic field. If relativistic particles are formed as the fast wind is shocked, then the enhanced magnetic field will result in nonthermal radio emission. The typical nonthermal radio flux at 1 GHz can be up to several millijanskys.

Typically, electrical breakdown occurs between two broad-area electrodes at electric fields 100-1000 times lower than the breakdown field (about 5000 MV/m) between a well-prepared point cathode and a broad-area anode. Explanations of the large differences remain unsatisfactory, usually evoking field emission from small projections on the cathode that are subject to higher peak fields. The field emission then produces secondary effects that lead to breakdown. This article provides a significant resolution to this long standing problem. Field emission is not present at all fields, but typically starts after some process occurs at the cathode surface. Three effects have been identified that produce the transition to field emission: work function changes; mechanical changes produced by the strong electrical forces on the electrode surfaces; and gas desorption from the anode with sufficient density to support an avalanche discharge. Material adsorbed on the cathode surface increases the work function of the metal, leading to a much higher threshold for field emission and higher breakdown fields. Localized regions of lower work function can be produced on the cathode by the transfer of microparticles from the anode and by stripping small areas of the cathode. The regions of low work function then serve as the source of enhanced field emission, leading to secondary effects which produce breakdown. Gas desorption is produced at an unconditioned anode as the voltage is increased. None of these effects are significant for a point cathode opposite a broad-area anode, but account for much of the large difference between microscopic and macroscopic breakdown fields. Careful surface preparation of electrodes increases the work function and reduces the number of weakly bound microparticles. Experiments designed to optimize these two different effects have led to electric fields as high as 90 MV/m at a 1 mm gap and 50 MV/m at a 4 mm gap, with no measurable field emission with plane-parallel electrodes made from copper, aluminum, titanium, and niobium. These fields, with no field emission or sparks during the conditioning phase, are comparable to the highest fields ever reached between plane-parallel electrodes of the same gap by any traditional conditioning method. The experimental results have been applied to operation of the electrostatic deflector of the Chalk River superconducting cyclotron. It has been used reliably for thousands of hours at fields up to 15 MV/m at a 5 mm gap, usually with no field emission. Experiments have also demonstrated that there is little enhancement in field emission at gaps up to 4 mm and that the only total-voltage effect for these gaps is from reduced thermal stability of the anode as the power density from the electrons increases with increasing voltage. © 1998 American Vacuum Society.",,"Cyclotrons; Electric breakdown; Electric field effects; Electric insulation; Electrodes; Electron emission; Electron transitions; Sorption; Chalk River superconducting cyclotron; Electrostatic deflectors; Vacuum high voltage insulation; Vacuum applications",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032025181

We measured plant biomass, foliar nitrogen and soluble tannin concentration, aphid fecundity, and snail growth, fecundity, and feeding preferences over one growing season. Elevated [CO2] did not have a significant impact on (1) the combined biomass of fast-growing or slow-growing plants, (2) herbivore feeding preferences, or (3) herbivore fitness. There was, however, a significant biomass increase of Carex flacca (which represented in all cases less than 5% of total live biomass), and some chemical changes in unpalatable plants under elevated [CO2]. The herbivory treatment significantly increased the biomass of slow-growing plants over fast-growing plants, whereas fertilisation significantly increased the abundance of fast-growing plants over slow-growing plants.

Research on measuring the economic impacts climate change might cause has proceeded world-wide, but most of the empirical research has focused on developed countries. It has been commonly believed that developing countries are more vulnerable to climate change because of their reliance on low-capital agriculture. It has been assumed, but never tested, that low-capital agriculture would have more difficulty adapting to climate changes. Country-wide economic analyses have been completed only for the United States even though experts have extrapolated results to all countries. Agronomic studies of crop yield reductions support this wisdom implying large potential agricultural damages in India, for example. The vulnerability of low-capital agriculture to climate change, however, depends upon whether the affected farmers can adjust to changing climates. The recent research in the United States suggests that adaptation by private producers would reduce damages to agriculture from climate change, and carbon fertilization would actually lead to net agricultural benefits from climate change. The set of studies in this report, explores farm performance across climates in India. The goal of the study is to examine farm behavior and test if there is any evidence that farmers in developing countries, such as India, currently adjust to their local climates. The reported studies measure the climate sensitivity of low-capital agriculture. They test whether actual farm performance is as sensitive to climate as agronomic models predict assuming no adaptation. The studies also compare the climate sensitivity of low-capital farms against the results already calibrated for United States agriculture. The analyses feature the Ricardian approach, a cross sectional analysis of farm performance across different climate zones. The method uses an economic measure of farm performance: farm value or net farm income. Performance is compared across a large landscape where farms exist in different local climates. By regressing farm performance on long term climate, one can empirically measure long run climate sensitivity. Other important factors determining economic performance, such as access to markets and soil quality must also be included in the analysis. The approach carefully measures long run climate responses, and not short-run adjustments or weather effects. Although the method does not explicitly identify how farmers have adjusted, the measure of economic performance captures the consequences of all the adjustments farmers currently undertake in responding to their local climates. Each of the Ricardian studies emphasizes a different methodology - all leading to similar estimates of climate change impact. The pooled data analysis (Chapter 4) examines overall expected effects. The year by year analysis (Chapter 5) examines annual fluctuations in climate sensitivity, while controlling for annual prices and weather. The climate-technology study (Chapter 6) examines the interaction between endogenous technology and climate sensitivity in India and Brazil, respectively. The results indicate that existing farms are only mildly climate sensitive implying a substantial amount of adaptation. This adaptation is predicted to reduce potential warming damages by one-third to one-half. The analysis further suggests that the climate response functions for farmers in India and Brazil are similar to the estimated functions for United States farmers. Low-capital agriculture appears to be no more climate sensitive than modern farms. These results suggest that warming alone will hurt agriculture in tropical (developing) countries relative to temperate countries. Damages from 8-12% are predicted by the Ricardian models. These results, however, do not include the effect of carbon fertilization. Carbon fertilization reduces the predicted damages in the agronomic models from 28% to 16%. Adding a 12% increase from carbon fertilization to the Ricardian estimates would drive the overall effects to near zero. The net results suggest that global warming will have only small effects on aggregate developing country agricultural sectors. The adaptation being measured in these Ricardian studies is largely private efforts by farmers to maximize net income given local environmental conditions. Each farmer is making different choices depending upon the conditions he/she faces. Because these subtle adaptations make farmers better off, we expect that farmers will engage in these activities as climate changes. These subtle adjustments reduce the overall sensitivity of agriculture to climate change. Technical change has been important to both India and Brazil over the years, substantially increasing productivity. However, agronomic research has not systematically focused on changing the climate sensitivity of crops. Investments in new technology have consequently not historically changed climate sensitivity in India or Brazil. This does not rule out the possibility of an important public research response to warming, it merely indicates that historic efforts have had no effect. Although aggregate agricultural sectors may not be at risk to climate change, individual farmers may still suffer large damages. Some areas will suffer from higher than average temperature changes and some areas may experience deleterious precipitation effects. The entire sector may not be affected because these effects will average out, but this does not protect local areas. Further, the aggregate sectors in developing countries may be less sensitive because important components of these sectors tend to lie in more temperate zones. Damages in marginal areas may have little impact on the aggregate because they contribute little to the aggregate outcome today. Poor people dependent on these local areas may be highly vulnerable to warming even when national agricultural impacts are minimal.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27844452992

Lidealized land-sea distributions are used to examine the effects of the latitude of continental coastlines, the meridional and zonal extent of continents, the shape of continents, and the presence of orography on circulation in the tropics and subtropics. It is found that the latitude of the continent is critical to the establishment of a distinct seasonality of precipitation and a summer monsoon circulation. Low-altitude positions of the continent lead to landlocked precipitation maxima, and poleward positions lead to a Mediterranean (winter monsoon) climate. In every case, the subsiding branch of the Hadley cell at continental longitudes locks over some part of the land. Variations in the meridional extent of land affect the strength of the Hadley cell and the degree of seasonality in the climate over land. The extension of a subtropical continent into the tropics is critical for establishing heavy convective rainfall over land in the summer.

Research into future climate change and the development of remedial environmental policies therefore require a reliable assessment of the long-term growth rate in the atmospheric methane load. Measurements have revealed that although the global atmospheric methane burden continues to increase with significant interannual variability, the overall rate of increase has slowed. Here we present an analysis of methane measurements from a global air sampling network that suggests that, assuming constant OH concentration, global annual methane emissions have remained nearly constant during the period 1984-96, and that the decreasing growth rate in atmospheric methane reflects the approach to a steady state on a timescale comparable to methane's atmospheric lifetime. If the global methane sources and OH concentration continue to remain constant, we expect average methane mixing ratios to increase slowly from today's 1,730 nmol mol-1 to ~1,800 nmol mol-1, with little change in the contribution of methane to the greenhouse effect.",,"methane; atmospheric methane; climate change; greenhouse effect; methane; air pollution; air sampling; article; environmental temperature; global climate; greenhouse effect; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032482404

The clean plasma conditions allow for investigation of the surface morphology of the samples under various exposure conditions. During high-temperature exposure the surface develops a porous structure, unlike the smooth surface resulting from low-temperature exposures. The hydrogen isotope retention characteristics of beryllium are measured under conditions which simulate the ITER first wall and baffle plasma interaction regions.

It also portrays the evolution of two system-wide effects - total vehicle miles travelled (VMT) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions - and accounts for lagged adjustments in travel behavior in its disequilibrium formulation. The model can be employed in optimal control exercises to determine what steps ought to be taken, when and where, and by how much in order to achieve planning objectives. Specifically, the model can be used to determine optimal combinations of traffic demand management measures, lane widening, and highway maintenance for achieving desired peak-period congestion levels, reducing VMT and VOC emissions to levels mandated by the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA), and keeping pavement conditions at acceptable serviceability ratings. Information on intertemporal tradeoffs between planning objectives, now required by the Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act (ISTEA), is generated in solutions to such exercises.

The cultures were grown with limiting amounts of ammonium as source of bound nitrogen and with L-lactate or L-malate as sources of carbon and reducing equivalents. De-repression of nitrogenase was determined on the basis of the occurrence of dinitrogen fixation, acetylene reduction and nifH promoter activities as well as on the basis of hydrogen evolution and nitrogenase polypeptides. In continuous culture, cells started to fix dinitrogen, to reduce acetylene, to activate the nifH promoter and to form nitrogenase polypeptides, when consuming lactate per ammonium at a C/N ratio of about 6 (this ratio represents the number of C and N atoms consumed). With malate as carbon source all of the activities became detectable above a C/N ratio of about 8. Essentially the same C/N ratios were determined with batch cultures for the occurrence of N-limitation of growth and hydrogen evolution. The experimentally determined C/N ratios for nitrogenase de-repression essentially agreed with C/N ratio of 5.8 and 7.8 calculated for the assimilation of ammonium and either lactate or malate, into biomass of an elemental composition of CH1.83N0.183O0.5. This means that the occurrence of N-limitation and nitrogenase de-repression is defined by a threshold C/N ratio required for biomass production. As experimentally and theoretically shown, this ratio depends on the reduction state of the carbon source. It is concluded that the C/N ratio of nutrient consumption represents an intracellular signal which is directly translated into nitrogenase de-repression.","C/N Ratio; Continuous Culture; Nitrogenase; Phototrophic Bacteria; Rhodobacter capsulatus","ammonia; bacterial metabolism; culture technique; defense mechanism; nitrogen metabolism; photosynthesis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Photobacteria; Rhodobacter capsulatus; Rhodobacter capsulatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032427612

In order to implement an effective control strategy, the relative role of these biogenic hydrocarbon emissions in producing ground-level ozone must be known. During the summers of 1995 and 1996, a field study was undertaken to determine fluxes of biogenic VOCs from both natural and agricultural surfaces in the Lower Fraser Valley located in southwestern British Columbia. Emissions from agricultural surfaces were measured using a flux gradient approach while emissions from the dominant tree species in the region were measured with a branch enclosure system. Results show very little biogenic VOC production from many agricultural crops such as pasture, Potatoes or Blueberries. Cranberries showed very high emissions during the summer of 1994 but failed to show similar results during the summer of 1995. Emissions of isoprene and monoterpenes from native tree species such as Western Red Cedar, Douglas Fir and Coastal Hemlock were quite low. Cottonwood trees on the other hand had fairly low emissions of monoterpenes but extremely high emissions of isoprene. Measurements provided here will be useful for improving our database of hydrocarbon emissions rates from vegetation for future emission inventories and model testing.","Biogenic trace gas flux; Isoprene; Monoterpenes; NMHC","Biogenic trace gas flux; Isoprene; Monoterpenes; Hydrocarbons; Vegetation; Volatile organic compounds; Gas emissions; isoprene; nitrogen oxide; ozone; terpene; volatile organic compound; agricultural emission; air quality; atmospheric pollution; biogenic emission; emission inventory; ozone; volatile organic compound; agriculture; air monitoring; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; air sampling; article; canada; crop; photochemistry; potato; priority journal; species; summer; tree; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345647108

A basic tenet that has guided the management of soil organic matter for decades has been that equilibrium levels of carbon and nitrogen are controlled by their net input and that qualitative differences in these inputs are relatively unimportant. This contrasts with natural ecosystems in which there are significant effects of species composition and litter quality on carbon and nitrogen cycling. Here we report the net balances of carbon and nitrogen from a 15-year study in which three distinct maize/soybean agroecosystems are compared. Quantitative differences in net primary productivity and nitrogen balance across agroecosystems do not account for the observed changes in soil carbon and nitrogen. We suggest that the use of low carbon-to-nitrogen organic residues to maintain soil fertility, combined with greater temporal diversity in cropping sequences, significantly increases the retention of soil carbon and nitrogen, which has important implications for regional and global carbon and nitrogen budgets, sustained production, and environmental quality.",,"carbon; nitrogen; agricultural practice; biogeochemical cycle; carbon; nitrogen; organic matter; soil emission; agriculture; article; crop; ecosystem; environmental impact assessment; legume; priority journal; soil treatment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032548085

Values of bulk (or wet) SO42- deposition and dry deposition of S determined from measured air concentrations and a deposition velocity were insufficient to balance watershed SO42- export at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest, NH and for a regional survey of watersheds in the northeastern U.S. We propose two explanations for the unmeasured S source: I) a significant underestimation of dry S deposition, and/or 2) internal watershed S sources, such as weathering and/or mineralization of soil organic S. Model simulations based on these two mechanisms agreed closely with measured stream SO42- concentrations at Hubbard Brook. Close agreement between measured and model predicted results precluded identification of which of the two mechanisms controlled long-term trends in stream SO42-. Model simulations indicated that soil adsorption reactions significantly delayed the response of stream water to declines in SO42- inputs since 1970, but could not explain the discrepancy in watershed S budgets. Extrapolation of model predictions into the future demonstrates that uncertainty in the source of the S imbalance in watersheds has important implications for assessments of the recovery of surface water acid neutralizing capacity in response to anticipated future reductions in SO2 emissions.","Acid neutralizing capacity; Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest; Mass balance model; Reduced SO2 emission; Sulfur deposition; Surface water sulfate","Acid neutralizing capacity; Sulfate; Adsorption; Air pollution; Extrapolation; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Sulfur dioxide; Surface waters; Watersheds; Water pollution control; sulfur; atmospheric deposition; sulfur; article; atmospheric dispersion; forest; seasonal variation; united states; water analysis; water contamination; water supply; United States, New Hampshire, Hubbard Brook",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032126407

Heating due to lateral introduction of hot fluids is becoming an increasingly recognized feature of the thermal histories of sedimentary basins. In some basins, heating by fluids may have an important effect on hydrocarbon source rock maturation history, so that quantification of the magnitude and timing of heating become essential elements in hydrocarbon prospectivity. In other cases, determining the time of fluid heating in a reservoir may provide a key constraint on hydrocarbon migration history. Examples are presented using AFTA apatite fission track analysis and vitrinite reflectance (VR) data to identify and quantify fluid heating in well sequences from several regions. In the West of Shetland region, in the vicinity of the Rona Ridge, non-linear palaeotemperature profiles defined by AFTA and VR results provide evidence of local heating shallow in the section. AFTA timing constraints suggest introduction of heated fluids produced by nearby Tertiary intrusive activity, although the time constraints are broad because of the low maximum palaeotemperatures involved (R 0max &lt;0.6%). In a well from Asia, transient maximum palaeotemperatures &gt;120°C resulted in R 0max &gt; 0.6% in an Eocene section, with AFTA constraining the fluid flow event responsible for the early to mid Miocene (25 to 10 Ma). On the North West Shelf of Australia transient fluid flow associated with hydrocarbon leakage, and possibly charge, has been previously identified by a combination of AFTA, VR and fluid inclusion homogenization temperature (T(h)) results. In the East Swan-2 well, a fracture inclusion in quartz from shallow Eocene sandstones gives a minimum T(h) value of 88°C, c.40°C higher than the present temperature. AFTA and VR data show no direct evidence of sustained heating at such a temperature, and can only be reconciled if the duration of heating was c.20 000 years. The results are consistent with this event being associated with passage of a hot brine and hydrocarbon fluid (O'Brien and Woods, 1995). These case studies demonstrate that a combination of thermal history tools can be used to identify and quantify the thermal effect of fluid flow, potentially allowing much tighter constraints on hydrocarbon generation and migration histories.",,"age determination; fission track dating; fluid flow; thermal evolution; vitrinite reflectance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032311263

Characteristic times describing the controlling fluid mechanics and chemical kinetics will be employed in the model to correlate both NOx and particulate emissions. Because the model equations are algebraic, they are suitable for implementation in a phenomenological cycle simulation program, or as an emissions model option in a computational fluid dynamics code. An original premise was that earlier work on global NO chemistry based on pollutant emissions dominated by diffusion flame contributions had adequately elucidated the kinetic aspects of the model. It is shown here that this approach is not valid for modern engines. Rather, an improved two-zone flame model for NO formation/decomposition is required. Mellor et al. [1] propose such a model, but include only qualitative preliminary model validation. Here we further test the model using measurements from a high speed direct injection (HSDI) Diesel engine with a common rail fuel injection system. Exhaust gas recirculation variations from zero to maximum level possible are reported and correlated for parametric variations of engine speed, injection pressure, and load. The two-zone NOx HSDI Diesel characteristic time model (CTM) involves a skeletal mechanism consisting of seven elementary reactions [1]. A surrogate stoichiometric flame temperature around a spray plume at start of combustion conditions represents the environment for NO-forming eddies in the first zone. The second zone surrounds the stoichiometric region, and NO decomposition may occur depending on a surrogate flame temperature at the end of combustion computed from fuel/air dual (i.e., limited-pressure) cycle analysis. Both Zeldovich and nitrous oxide mechanisms are considered in each zone. Two objectives are accomplished in the present paper. First, in Mellor et al. [1] the N2O mechanism was postulated to be important to the NO formation kinetics under Diesel engine in-cylinder conditions. In addition, it was suggested that NO decomposition reactions may occur at high engine loads through the reverse N2O and Zeldovich mechanisms. These hypotheses are validated using the measured engine data. Second, we extend the previous work through preliminary development of the fluid mechanic aspects of the model. A characteristic mixing time that is a function of Reynolds number, Weber number, and engine geometry is developed. When used in combination with the kinetic time for NO formation as a Damköhler number, correlations of NOx emissions for the above parametric variations are obtained for conditions where NO decomposition does not occur. © 1998 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; Diffusion in liquids; Direct injection; Engine cylinders; Exhaust gas recirculation; Exhaust gases; Fluid mechanics; Fuels; Kinetics; Nitrogen oxides; Parametric devices; Reaction kinetics; Reynolds number; Common rail fuel injection; Computational Fluid Dynamics codes; Direct injection diesel engines; Elementary reaction; Engineering modeling; High speed direct injections; Nitrous oxide mechanism; Parametric variation; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072456177

Estimates are provided on the amount of carbon that could be sequestered in soils in various regions in Canada by reducing summerfallow area, increased use of forage crops, improved erosion control, shifts from conventional to minimal and no-till, and more intensive use of fertilizers. The reduction of summerfallow by more intensive agriculture would increase the continuous cropland base by 8.1% in western Canada and 6.8% in all of Canada. Although increased organic carbon (OC) sequestration could be achieved in all agricultural regions, the greatest potential gains are in areas of Chernozemic soils. The best management options include reduction of summerfallow, conversion of fallow areas to hay or continuous cereals, fertilization to ensure nutrient balance, and adoption of soil conservation measures. The adoption of these options could sequester about 50-75% of the total agricultural emissions of CO2 in Canada for the next 30 years. However, increased sequestration of atmospheric carbon in the soil is possible for only a limited time. Increased efforts must be made to reduce emissions if long-term mitigation is to be achieved.","Agriculture; Canada; Carbon sequestration; Conservation tillage; Cropping practices","agricultural emission; agricultural management; biogeochemical cycle; carbon sequestration; emission control; environmental policy; land use; soil carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031720211

Synthetic bDNA amplifier molecules and multiples copies of an alkaline phosphatase-linked probe are hybridized to the immobilized complex. Detection is achieved by incubating the complex with a chemiluminiscent substrate and measuring the light emission. Since the target is not amplified, the signal is proportional to the level of target nucleic acid. The bDNA assay is a quantitative method that provides precision, accuracy and reproducibility.

On the basis of these calculations, we estimate the rates at which O3 and its precursor compounds are exported to the background atmosphere and how these export rates are affected by various control strategies that might be implemented to reduce maximum O3 concentrations within the urban plume. Two model cities with different chemical characteristics are considered: case 1, where peak O3 concentrations during extreme air pollution episodes are more sensitive to nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) and case 2, where peak O3 concentrations during these episodes are more sensitive to volatile organic compounds (VOC). The model is first run for extreme meteorological conditions conducive to the generation of high O3 concentrations to determine the most effective emission control strategies for reducing peak O3 under these conditions. The model is then run for more typical meteorological conditions, to determine how these various emission control scenarios might affect the export of O3 and its precursors from the urban to the rural and background atmosphere. The export of O3 from the urban atmosphere is found to be more sensitive to NOx emissions, even for case 2 where VOC emission controls more effectively reduced peak O3 during pollution episodes. The impact of VOC and NOx emission reductions on the export of primary and secondary O3 precursor compounds is more complex, leading to reductions in the export of some species and enhancements in the export of others.

Landfarming is designed to stimulate microbial-based catabolism of petroleum through combined dilution/mixing and fertilization-based effects. To evaluate nitrogen-based effects during remediation, the site was sectioned and treated with urea, ammonium sulfate, or ammonium nitrate. Samples were obtained from prairie soil without chemical nitrogen addition and with or without hydrocarbon contamination. Nitrogen cycling dynamics were followed by measuring ammonium, nitrite, nitrate, and volatile nitric oxide (NOx) levels. Nitrifying and denitrifying bacterial numbers were estimated and compared to soil oxygen, carbon dioxide, and methane levels as well as to overall total petroleum hydrocarbon (TPH) reduction. For a prairie ecosystem of this type, a high level of fertilization, particularly with nitrogen, can have ecological effects almost as profound as the petroleum contamination itself.

Monitoring has been carried out every July by the same individual. The data set represents a unique long-term record of the dynamics of a complete plant community. 2 Records for the most abundant taxa (including bare ground and litter) were used to determine the effect of climate variability on the year-to-year performance of the selected species. Residuals about the long-term mean log biomass of each species (detrended where the species showed a significant increase or decrease in abundance over time) were correlated against indices of interannual climate variability. Plant and weather records were compared over 3-month seasonal periods (March-May, June-August, September-November, December-February) or 6-month seasonal periods (March-August, September-February), with time lags of 0, 1 and 2 years. 3 Principal components analysis (PCA) was used to formulate annual weather indices, using either conventional weather variables (temperature, rainfall and sunshine) or the Lamb catalogue of daily weather types. 4 Between 5% and 70% more correlations were observed than might be expected to occur by chance, depending on the season and the PCA index, indicating markedly non-random plant-weather relationships. Total vegetation production was positively correlated with minimum spring temperature. The distribution of correlations was generally evenly distributed across the three lag periods. 5 In general, those species favoured by environmental stress or disturbance were promoted following warm dry springs and summers, whereas those favoured by more productive conditions were promoted following a wet growing season.","Lamb daily weather types; Long-term monitoring; Perennial herbaceous vegetation; Plant-weather relations; Principal components analysis","united kingdom; vegetation; weather; plant community; roadside environment; vegetation dynamics; weather; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031876086

If a state or local air district can adequately document that an exceedance of the PM10 national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) is caused by a qualifying natural event, the data will be flagged in the EPA Air Information Retrieval System (AIRS) database and it can be excluded from the determination of NAAQS compliance.

Nevtherless, althouth the policy debate tends to take place in global and national areans, action to abate GHG emissions is inherently within the provenance of local institutions and communities. The purpose of this paper is to examine how much information is lost by not estimating GHG emissions data at scales finer than the whole US. Such information may be critical in bridging global and local policy. Differences in the composition of GHG emission sources based on GHG emission inventories at three nested spatial scales (national, state, local) for four study sites (in Kansas, North Carolina, Ohio and Pennsylvania) are analysed, drawing upon initial results of a large collaborative study known as the 'Association of American Geographers-Global Change in Local Places (GCLP)' project. The concept of spatial sovereignty of emissions is developed to test the cross-scale reliability of emission inventories. For the test year 1990, close agreement is found in the by-gas composition of GHG emissions among national, state and local inventories. Spatial sovereignty in this composition of GHG emissions along national, state and local inventories. Spatial sovereignty in this case is not maintained. Regular compilation of state and local emissions source inventories may be necessary to track important spatial and temporal deviations from national trends.",,"emission inventory; global warming; greenhouse gas; pollution monitoring; sovereignty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031763837

EURAD consists of three main parts for the treatment of meteorology, chemistry and transport (EURAD-CTM), and emissions. Using a one-dimensional version of the EURAD-CTM, it was obvious that the POCP of various species may considerably vary with the compositional state of the atmosphere though it remains a useful parameter to assess the efficiency of VOC classes qualitatively. Another evaluation of emission changes became possible through the comparison of simulations using emission inventories of Europe before and after the dramatic economical changes in the former COMECON in 1990.

We measured vagal carotid baroreceptor-cardiac reflexes and steady-state fast Fourier transform R-R interval and photoplethysmographic arterial pressure power spectra at three arterial pressure levels (nitroprusside, saline, and phenylephrine infusions) and three end-tidal CO2 levels (3, 4, and 5%, fixed-frequency, large-tidal-volume breathing, CU2 plus 02). Our study supports three principal conclusions. First, although low levels of CO2 chemoreceptor stimulation reduce R-R intervals and R-R interval variability, statistical modeling suggests that this effect is indirect rather than direct and is mediated by reductions of arterial pressure. Second, reductions of R-R intervals during hypocapnia reflect simple shifting of vagally mediated carotid baroreflex responses on the R-R interval axis rather than changes of baroreflex gain, range, or operational point. Third, the influence of CO2 chemoreceptor stimulation on arterial pressure (and, derivatively, on R-R intervals and R-R interval variability) depends critically on baseline arterial pressure levels: chemoreceptor effects are smaller when pressure is low and larger when arterial pressure is high. defense reaction; vagal baroreceptor; sympathetic innervation; hyperventila'tion.",,"carbon dioxide; nitroprusside sodium; phenylephrine; sodium chloride; vasoconstrictor agent; vasodilator agent; adult; analysis of variance; artery; article; biological model; blood; blood pressure; chemoreceptor; female; Fourier analysis; human; male; NASA Discipline Cardiopulmonary; Non-NASA Center; photoelectric plethysmography; physiology; pressoreceptor reflex; statistical model; supine position; NASA Discipline Cardiopulmonary; Non-NASA Center; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Arteries; Baroreflex; Blood Pressure; Carbon Dioxide; Chemoreceptors; Female; Fourier Analysis; Humans; Male; Models, Cardiovascular; Models, Statistical; Nitroprusside; Phenylephrine; Photoplethysmography; Sodium Chloride; Supine Position; Vasoconstrictor Agents; Vasodilator Agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33746733565

The importance of the non-LTE correction to Qv depends, for the most part, on the degree to which the lowest vibrational state of the molecule is in non-LTE for a given altitude, since it is this vibration that contributes most to the partition sum. The affect on high-altitude emission depends on the principle excitation mechanism of the radiating molecule, and we compare CO2 and O3. In the case of CO2, to first order, the high-altitude radiance measured by a limb-viewing radiometer is dependent on the value of the inverse of the partition sum in the region just above the tangent point. We have shown that in the case of the high-altitude temperature sounding channel of the High Resolution Dynamics Limb Sounder (HIRDLS) the non-LTE correction can result in a difference in calculated radiance of some 30% at 130 km. This suggests that the non-LTE correction to Qv is an important consideration for high-altitude non-LTE radiative transfer models. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The approach is guided by the study of a suite of synthetic tracers, i, with uniform continental sources and constant but different lifetimes of 1, 2, 5, 20, 50, and 100 days, whose global distributions are calculated from a three-dimensional chemical tracer model. With the help of the model we show that in a grid box the standard deviation σi divided by the average concentration M̄i is a unique function of the chemical lifetime τi. In favorable cases, for instance, in surface air within a specific region sampled by the Pacific Exploratory Mission (PEM) West B campaign, that function takes a simple form: σi/M̄i = A × τi-α, with α = 0.48, very close to 1/2. An analogous relation is found for the alkanes, ethane through n-hexane, measured during the PEM West B campaign in the same domain, with their reaction rate constant with OH, kOH. That relation has the form σi/M̄i = B × (kOH,i)α′ with α′ = 0.49. Using the alkenes, for example propene, which also react with O3, the dependence on kOH,i can be related to a dependence on τi. This allows us to estimate the OH concentration, 6 × 105cm-3, with an error of roughly a factor of 2 for this region (boundary layer, 30°N-40°N latitude, and 135°E-155°E longitude in March). This estimate is essentially based on empirical relations only and the assumption that the considered hydrocarbons have the same source distribution. As a by-product, we show that the α defined above is related to the slope in the (logarithmic) correlation plot between the mixing ratios of two trace gases with different lifetimes. We also show that the global distribution of α appears to be a useful tool to diagnose fast regional transport.

In order to study the potential role of AE3 in human neurological disease, we characterized AE3 genomic structure and performed mutational analysis on patients with an episodic movement disorder that maps to the same genetic locus. AE3 genomic organization, including the nucleotide sequence of the 5′-untranslated region and intron/ exon boundaries, is highly conserved between humans and homologs from mouse and rat. Mutational analysis revealed no disease-causing defect in patients with familial paroxysmal dyskinesia, although several benign polymorphisms were identified. AE3 variation may prove useful for further genetic studies, such as finer resolution mapping.

A study on the synthesis and properties investigation of hypereutectic Al-13.5Si-2.5Mg alloy reinforced with carbon chars using coconut shell as the organic precursor has been carried out. The low-cost, double compaction solid-state technique was used. Reinforcing the hypereutectic alloy with coconut shell char particles (size: &lt; 140 μm) at 2 vol % and consolidating by reaction sintering at 600°C in vacuum for 15 min, followed by near net-shape compaction at 250 MPa, increased the hardness of the alloy 6% while reducing its strength (UTS) by only 3%. The use of palm kernel shell char as the dispersed phase was found to yield identical results. At 2 vol% char, the mechanical properties, sintered density and dimensional changes were optimally found to be suitable for lightweight anti-friction electromechanical applications. Attempts to reinforce the alloy with 2 vol% coconut shell chars activated in CO2 reduced its strength in the range of 19 to 26% at different burn-off percentages. This is attributed to the higher amount of oxide products formed during the activation process. At 600°C, formation of the brittle Al4C3 phase in the different sintered composites containing activated and unactivated chars was identified by X-ray studies. © 1998 Chapman &amp; Hall.",,"Aluminum alloys; Brittleness; Hardness; Magnesium alloys; Particle size analysis; Sintering; Synthesis (chemical); Vacuum; Hypereutectic alloys; Palm kernel shell char; Metallic matrix composites",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032000704

One such option that has been studied within the IEA Greenhouse Gas Implementing Agreement, is the capture and disposal of CO2 from combustion gases. Such options for Sweden have been examined in a system study financed by NTJTEK (The Swedish National Board for Industrial and Technical Development). Aquifers that should be suitable for disposal of CO2, exist in the South of Sweden - Denmark and in the Baltic Sea close to Lithuania. Based on commercially available technologies, CO2 can be captured from NGCC (natural gas combined cycle) and coal based IGCC (integrated gasification combined cycle) power plants. Most of the energy needed for the CO2 capture could then be recovered as district heating, thus maintaining the total energy efficiencies. At approximately 300 MW power production capacities, the heat quantities produced (55-85 MW heat) are likely to be suitable for a reasonable number of the Swedish district heating networks. CO2 neutral production and utilisation of methanol as an automative fuel for the transport sector integrated with production of electric power and district heat, could be achieved with biomass combined with natural gas or coal as a raw material. An amount of CO2 corresponding to the carbon in the fossil fuel then has to be captured and disposed. Examples of possible process concepts have been examined. The resulting estimated total costs for capture, transport and disposal of CO2, are in the same order of magnitude as the current Swedish carbon dioxide tax (365 SEK/ton CO2). Plant owners have to be credited for the captured and disposed CO2 in order to make this option economically justifiable and interesting for them. It will be important for the total economy to find favourable combinations of energy conversion, CO2 capture and recovery, transport and disposal-There is also a need to reduce todays uncertainties in the available basis for estimation of costs for large scale transport, injection and disposal of CO2 into aquifers.

Hydrogenation of CO2 to methanol is investigated in a dielectric-barrier discharge (DBD) with and without the presence of a catalyst. Comparison of experiments shows that this nonequilibrium discharge can effectively lower the temperature range of optimum catalyst performance. The simultaneous presence of the discharge shifts the temperature region of maximum catalyst activity from 220 to 100 °C, a much more desirable temperature range. The presence of the catalyst, on the other hand, increases the methanol yield and selectivity by more than a factor of 10 in the discharge. Experiment and numerical simulation show that methane formation is the major competitive reaction for methanol formation in the discharge.

Recent legislation designed to reduce air pollution has restricted Californian rice-farmers from burning rice stubble after harvest. Intentional flooding of fields during winter to speed straw decomposition is becoming increasingly common as growers seek alternatives to burning residual straw. The potential for flooded fields to act as a surrogate for destroyed wetland habitat may be an additional benefit in a region that hosts a large proportion of North America's wintering waterbirds. We investigated the degree to which waterbirds use flooded fields and whether the method of flooding affects their use. Specifically, we tested whether waterbird use (a) was greater in intentionally flooded fields than in unflooded fields, (b) differed among flooded fields receiving different straw manipulations and (c) varied with water depth. 2. Intentionally flooded rice fields received significantly greater use by 24 of 31 species studied. Only great blue herons Ardea herodias and sandhill cranes Grus canadensis were significantly more common in unflooded fields. Geese densities did not differ between flooded and unflooded fields. 3. We found no differences in the densities of most species in flooded fields that received different straw manipulations to improve decomposition rates. Exceptions included several small shorebirds which occurred at highest densities in fields where straw was incorporated into the soil. 4. Species differed in their use of different water depths. For 14 species we tested whether preferred depths, suggested in the literature, received disproportionately higher use. Most of these species were more likely to be encountered within the suggested depth ranges. Depth, however, was a poor predictor of bird density. Depths of 15-20 cm resulted in frequent use by the greatest number of species. 5. We conclude that flooding rice fields increased suitable habitat for most, but not all, species studied. Different straw manipulation methods had little effect on most species. Water depth, however, was important in determining species occurrence. During the first half of the winter, water depths were greater than the median depths used by most species.","Agriculture; Shorebirds; Water depth; Waterfowl; Wetland management","flooding; habitat use; rice field; water depth; waterbird; USA, Caltfornia; Ardea herodias; Grus canadensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031970477

We propose that wet soil moisture conditions over any large region should be associated with relatively large boundary layer moist static energy, which favors the occurrence of more rainfall. Since soil moisture conditions themselves reflect past occurrence of rainfall, the proposed hypothesis implies a positive feedback mechanism between soil moisture and rainfall. This mechanism is based on considerations of the energy balance at the land-atmosphere boundary, in contrast to similar mechanisms that were proposed in the past and that were based on the concepts of water balance and precipitation recycling. The control of soil moisture on surface albedo and Bowen ratio is the fundamental basis of the proposed soil moisture-rainfall feedback mechanism. The water content in the upper soil layer affects these two important properties of the land surface such that both variables decrease with any increase in the water content of the top soil layer. The direct effect of soil moisture on surface albedo implies that wet soil moisture conditions enhance net solar radiation. The direct effect of soil moisture on Bowen ratio dictates that wet soil moisture conditions would tend to enhance net terrestrial radiation at the surface through cooling of surface temperature, reduction of Upwards emissions of terrestrial radiation, and simultaneous increase in atmospheric water vapor content and downwards flux of terrestrial radiation. Thus, under wet soil moisture conditions, both components of net radiation are enhanced, resulting in a larger total flux of heat from the surface into the boundary layer. This total flux represents the sum of the corresponding sensible and latent heat fluxes. Simultaneously, cooling of surface temperature should be associated with a smaller sensible heat flux and a smaller depth of the boundary layer. Whenever these processes occur over a large enough area, the enhanced flux of heat from the surface into the smaller reservoir of boundary layer air should favor a relatively large magnitude of moist static energy per unit mass of the boundary layer air. The dynamics of localized convective storms as well as the dynamics of large-scale atmospheric circulations have been shown to be sensitive to the distribution of boundary layer moist static energy by several previous studies. These theoretical concepts are tested using field observations from Kansas and explored further in a companion paper [Zheng and Eltahir, this issue] using a simple numerical model.",,"feedback mechanism; soil moisture/rainfall; Atmospheric boundary layer; Atmospheric temperature; Boundary layers; Feedback; Feedback control; Heat flux; Infrared radiation; Moisture; Moisture control; Rain; Reservoirs (water); Soils; Solar radiation; Surface properties; Water content; Water recycling; Atmospheric circulation; Atmospheric water vapor; Land atmosphere interaction; Moisture conditions; Precipitation recycling; Sensible and latent heat fluxes; Surface temperatures; Terrestrial radiation; Soil moisture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031947959

In conjunction with project partners, the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management developed a multidimensional survey instrument to identify risk reduction opportunities. Investigators sought to characterize the range of environmental and industrial hygiene controls employed by Rhode Island facilities for the purposes of focusing state technical and compliance assistance efforts. Data were collected on a diverse range of subject areas including work force demographics; source reduction; potential health hazards; worker protection and safety; solid and hazardous waste management; and air pollution control. Nearly one-half of the shops employ three or fewer people, and in many cases, spray painters double as body repair technicians thereby increasing their potential exposure to workplace contaminants. While nearly all of the shops reported that they use spray painting booths, only 38% own booths of the more effective downdraft design. Based on the self-reported data, recently promulgated state air pollution control regulations (requiring the use of compliant coatings, enclosed or modified spray gun cleaners, and high- volume, low-pressure, spray guns) appear to be effective at motivating companies toward source reduction. A range of risk reduction opportunities were identified as input material changes, technology changes, and improved operating practices. Better methods of risk communication; a professional licensing requirement; and targeted training, compliance, and technical assistance would help to achieve greater levels of risk reduction in this mature, high-hazard industry.","Automobile refinishing; Environmental health; Occupational health and safety; Personal protection; Pollution prevention; Risk reduction","chromium; heavy metal; industrial chemical; isocyanate; lead; paint; solvent; volatile organic compound; zinc oxide; air pollution; article; automobile industry; environmental exposure; female; human; industrial worker; major clinical study; male; occupational exposure; occupational hazard; pollution control; risk management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031878276

Comparing the results of the two Outcomes shows that introducing even the harshest car restraint policies will have only a marginal effect on reducing carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides and VOC levels, and that technological fixes would contribute far more to improving air quality. Additionally, pro-bus measures actually increased the levels of particulates more than they would have otherwise, and thus recent worries regarding the influence of particulates on human health (lung problems, cancer, etc.) would be exacerbated still further. One area where traffic policies did exercise an impact was on levels of carbon dioxide, the levels of which dropped as car restraint measures were tightened. This is the downside of applying catalytic converter technology across the vehicle fleet. However, what should be borne in mind is that a number of air pollution experts see the reductions in pollution levels caused by catalytic converters being overtaken by the growth in traffic levels from around the year 2010 (RCEP23). On current evidence, traffic policies will therefore play an increasingly important role in mitigating the deterioration in air quality over the longer term. These findings confirm that even fairly radical transport policy measures do not exert more than a marginal influence on overall emission levels when compared with savings made by technological improvements. However, as the last example highlighted, one area where their importance cannot be understated is in being able to influence where the emissions take place.",,"bus transport; emission control; traffic emission; transportation policy; urban area; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032468469

The near-surface region of the native oxide of the hot-rolled Al foil contains primarily C and O. Cl and Ca contamination also are present at the outermost atomic layer according to ISS. H-atom exposures reduce the amount of carbonates and hydrocarbons but causes an enrichment of sulfur in the outermost layer of the foil. The O-to-Al ratio is reduced, and the AlO x . species initially present is converted to Al 2 O 3 . After sputtering the Al foil to remove the Cl, C, and Ca contaminants, the Al was exposed to oxygen at 10 -7 Torr for 10 min. The near-surface region of this re-oxidized surface contains both Al metal and Al 2 O 3 . Exposing this partially oxidized surface to H-atoms produces a chemically-induced driving force which causes subsurface O to migrate toward the surface of the foil. This results in an increase of the Al 2 O 3 concentration at the sample surface. These results suggest that the thickness of Al oxide layers may be controlled using H-atom exposures. Furthermore, the amounts of carbon contamination can be decreased and possibly eliminated without reducing the alumina. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.","Alumina; Foil; H-atom; Hot-rolled; Re-oxidized","Alumina; Aluminum foil; Atoms; Contamination; Hot rolling; Hydrogen; Oxidation; Thin films; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Hydrogen atom exposures; Ion scattering spectroscopy; Surfaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032473716

We used a dataset of rangeland surveys to examine the productivities of 22 plant species throughout the Great Plains of the United States with respect to three environmental factors: temperature, precipitation and soil texture. Productivity of plant species was obtained from Natural Resource Conservation Service (NRCS) range site descriptions. We interpolated climate data from 296 weather stations throughout the region and used soil texture data from NRCs State Soil Geographic (STATSGO) databases. We performed regression analyses to drive models of the relative and absolute production of each species in terms of mean annual temperature (MAT), mean annual precipitation (MAP), and percentage SAND, SILT and CLAY. MAT was the most important factor for 55% of species analyzed; MAP was most explanatory for 40 of the species, an a soil texture variable was most important for only one species. Production of C3 species tended to be negatively related to MAT, MAP and positively related to CLAY. Production of C4 shortgrasses, in general, was positively related to MAT and negatively related to MAP and SAND, whereas C4 tallgrass productivity tended to be positively associated with MAP and SAND, and was highest at intermediate values of MAT. Our results indicate the extent to which functional types can be used to represent individual species. The regression equations derived in this analysis can be important inclusions in models that assess the effects of climate change on plant communities throughout the region.","Functional types; Grasslands; Precipitation; Soil texture; Temperature","grassland; precipitation; productivity; soil texture; temperature; USA, Great Plains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031936297

However, plant type may influence temporal patterns of nutrient cycling between plant and soil. Plants having the carbon-3 (C3) or carbon-4 (C4) photosynthetic pathway differ in phenology as well as other attributes that affect nitrogen (N) cycling. We estimated net N mineralization rates and traced nitrogen-15 (15N) additions among plant and soil components during May, July, and September of 1995 in native plots of C3 plants, C4 plants, or mixtures of C3 and C4. Net N mineralization was significantly greater in C3 plots than in C4 plots during both July and September. C3 plots retained significantly more 15N in May than did mixed and C4 plots; these differences in 15N retention were due to greater 15N uptake by C3 plants than by C4 plants during May. There were no significant differences in total 15N retention among plant communities for July and September. Soil 15N was influenced more by presence or absence of plants than by type of plant; greater quantities of 15N remained in soil interspaces between plants than in soil directly under plants for July and September. Our results indicate that plant functional type (C3 versus C4) can affect both the spatial and the temporal patterns of N cycling in shortgrass steppe. Further research is necessary to determine how these intraseasonal differences translate to longer-term and coarser-scale effects of plants on N cycling, retention, and storage. © 1998 Springer-Verlag.","C3 and C4; Grasslands; Nitrogen cycling; Nitrogen mineralization; Nitrogen retention; Nitrogen-15; Photosynthetic pathway; Plant functional types; Plant-soil interactions; Shortgrass steppe",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001424653

The refrigeration benefits the refinery by recovering salable product and increasing the capacity of the process units with no additional electrical demand. The constraints to be satisfied by the ARU design were very stringent: low temperature waste heat; very low refrigeration temperature; limited plot space; geographically separated streams; and very limited cooling water. In order to satisfy all these constraints and to make the economics more favorable, several new concepts were developed and incorporated in the ARU.

Three such stations were applied in a pilot project for a year on three sites (Speulder forest in The Netherlands, Auchencorth in Scotland and Melpitz in Germany) in different regions in Europe to estimate local inputs and to validate deposition models which are currently used or developed to estimate ecosystem specific deposition in Europe. Fluxes at Auchencorth Moss are lowest for all components, except for those much influenced by the sea as a source. As Melpitz is located far away from seas, these components are lowest at this site. Wet deposition is the dominant source of input at Auchencorth, whereas at Speulder forest, through its roughness and pollution climate, dry deposition is dominant. At this site dry deposition velocities are highest. Melpitz is a polluted site. Particularly sulphur deposition is high. It is recommended to equip several locations in Europe with intensive deposition monitoring methods. Such a network will be an extension of existing monitoring programmes on air pollution, such as that run by Eurepean Monitoring and Evaluation Programme for the long-range transmission of air pollutants in Europe (EMEP). The intensive monitoring locations should be selected based on pollution climates and type of vegetation, common in Europe.","Acidification; Dry and wet deposition; Euthrophication; Monitoring","Acidification; Air pollutants; Atmospheric deposition; Dry deposition; Wet deposition; Ecosystems; Environmental engineering; Eutrophication; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Monitoring; Sulfur; Air pollution; rain; sulfur; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; monitoring; air pollution; article; climate; dry deposition; environmental monitoring; germany; netherlands; pollution transport; united kingdom; Europe; Bryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032210856

All components of the planktonic food-web were collected from the same water sample (with the exception of crustaceans), counted microscopically, converted to carbon units, and averaged over the euphotic zone. Due to phosphorus load reductions and the impact of non-indigenous mussels in the lower lakes, physical/chemical characteristics of the lower lakes are becoming similar to those in the upper lakes. Spring total phosphorus and euphotic zone depth were relatively similar among all the stations (except western Lake Erie), ranging from 3 to 7 μ/g/L and 21 to 26 m, respectively. During the summer, total phosphorus concentrations were more variable, but ranged between 4 to 10 μg/L at all stations except western Lake Erie. Planktonic biomass was correlated with total phosphorus concentration. Within a season, the structure of the planktonic food-web was remarkably similar among all stations across all the lakes. Of the seventeen food-web structure parameters examined, only two exhibited significant differences-among stations during the spring isothermal period; only four parameters exhibited significant differences among stations during the summer. Small plankton were very abundant in all the lakes. Picoplankton (0.2 to 2.0 μn) biomass was approximately equal to the combined biomass of nanno- and microplankton (2 to 200 μn). For microorganisms (all organisms except crustaceans) autotrophic: heterotrophic ratios averaged 1.3 (spring = 1.1, summer = 1.5). The heterotrophic microorganism community was comprised of bacteria (mean = 65%), protozoans (mean = 32%), and rotifers (3%). Even though zebra mussel veligers were found-in all the lakes except Lake Superior, their contribution to microorganism biomass never exceeded 1%. Due to seasonal variation in crustacean abundance, the mean contribution of major functional groups varied by season; producers (autotrophs), decomposers (bacteria), micrograzers (protozoans and rotifers), and mesograzers ('crustaceans) constituted 40%, 30%, 11%, and 19% of total planktonic carbon, respectively, during the spring, and 32%, 15%, 9%, and 43%, respectively, during the summer. The overall similarity in the structure of the planktonic food-web across all stations in the Great Lakes was attributed to the strong influence of abiotic factors.","Autotrophic; Great Lakes; Heterotrophic; Microorganisms; Picoplankton; Planktonic food-web","community structure; environmental factor; food web; lake ecosystem; plankton; Great Lakes; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031761448

Tests demonstrated that wallboard was the major cause of hydrogen sulfide production and that methanogenesis and sulfate reduction occur concurrently during refuse decomposition. Additionally, both polymer- and lime-treated sludge enhanced refuse decomposition.

This thin unit is capped by evaporites of the Carrolls Corner Formation, both formations being at the base of the Visean Windsor Group. Mapping in the vicinity of the Jubilee Zn-Pb deposit shows that the Mabou Group and part of the underlying Windsor Group lie unconformably over the Lower Windsor Group, implying a local truncation of 545 m of Windsor Group strata. Another omission of 500 m is recognized near the deposit, where the Upper Windsor lies directly on the Lower Windsor Group. These unconformities are considered to be associated with the regional Ainslie detachment, which is consistently found on Cape Breton Island at the top of the Macumber Formation, i.e., at the limestone and evaporite contact in the Lower Windsor Group. The fact that the limestone breccia which hosts mineralization is confined to a single stratigraphic level, as well as the angularity and the puzzlelike texture of thebreccia fragments, points to a link between the breccia and the Ainslie detachment. It is suggested that during extension, the high rheological contrast at the limestone-evaporite contact generated a tectonic brecciation in the relatively less ductile limestone, thus, a tectono-hydraulic origin is suggested for the mineralized breccia. Stratigraphic correlations using the contact between the Windsor Group and the Horton Group as a marker horizon indicate the presence of the Jubilee and Road subvertical faults in the vicinity of the deposit. They also show that the faults postdate lithification of the Macumber Formation. At the Jubilee deposit, the premineralization events comprise (1) stylolitization parallel to bedding, (2) brecciation of a finely laminated lithofacies, (3) migration of hydrocarbons, and (4) precipitation of brown fibrous calcite. The mineralization stage comprises (1) development of subvertical microfractures crosscutting breccia fragments, (2) precipitation of pyrite-marcasite-sphalerite-galena-chalcopyrite, and (3) precipitation of anhedral calcite. Low δ 13C values are observed in the premineralization fibrous calcite (avg = -25‰) and in the syn- to postmineralization anhedral calcite (avg = -15‰). These signatures are interpreted to reflect the dominance of bicarbonate ions derived from organic carbon in the buried sequence. Low δ 18O values (avg = -10‰) in the anhedral calcite are interpreted to originate from precipitation in the presence of warm fluids. Radiogenic strontium (avg = 87Sr/ 86Sr of 0.70860) in the carbonate phases supports a clastic-dominated basin origin for the metal-rich brines. The proposed metallogenic model for the Jubilee Zn-Pb deposit comprises the following: (1) brecciation of a precursor limestone, creating a reservoir which is later filled by hydrocarbons, (2) sulfate reduction by hydrocarbons, increasing H 2S concentrations, (3) ascent of metal-rich fluids toward the hydrocarbon and H 2S reservoir along subvertical faults, (4) mixing of metal-rich fluids with H 2S, leading to sulfide precipitation (pyrite, marcasite, sphalerite, and galena), and (5) filling of residual pores with anhedral calcite and sulfates (barite, gypsum, and anhydrite). During their ascent, the hot metal-rich brines leached the underlying rocks of the Horton Group. Sulfates most likely originated from the thick evaporite cap of the Carrolls Corner Formation.",,"base metal; geochemistry; metallogenesis; ore deposit; petrography; structural geology; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032469335

It is estimated at about 1400 Pg globally, which is roughly twice that in atmospheric CO2. The soil can act as both a source and a sink for carbon and nutrients. Changes in agricultural land use and climate can lead to changes in the amount of carbon held in soils, thus, affecting the fluxes of CO2 to and from the atmosphere. Some agricultural management practices will lead to a net sequestration of carbon in the soil. Regional estimates of the carbon sequestration potential of these practices are crucial if policy makers are to plan future land uses to reduce national CO2 emissions. In Europe, carbon sequestration potential has previously been estimated using data from the Global Change and Terrestrial Ecosystems Soil Organic Matter Network (GCTE SOMNET). Linear relationships between management practices and yearly changes in soil organic carbon were developed and used to estimate changes in the total carbon stock of European soils. To refine these semi-quantitative estimates, the local soil type, meteorological conditions and land use must also be taken into account. To this end, we have modified the Rothamsted Carbon Model, so that it can be used in a predictive manner, with SOMNET data. The data is then adjusted for local conditions using Geographical Information Systems databases. In this paper, we describe how these developments can be used to estimate carbon sequestration at the regional level using a dynamic simulation model linked to spatially explicit data. Some calculations of the potential effects of afforestation on soil carbon stocks in Central Hungary provide a simple example of the system in use.","Carbon sequestration; Geographical Information Systems; Hungarian soils; Modelling; Soil organic carbon","agriculture; biosphere; carbon dioxide; carbon; environmental management; geography; Hungary; organic matter; soil degradation; soil; biogeochemical cycle; carbon sequestration; soil carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031857044

Hepatic effects of exogenous immunomodulators are discussed with special focus on the most widely used immunosuppressive agents, CsA and tacrolimus. An important question exists as to whether these potential hepatoprotective effects are related mechanistically to the immune system or are working at different levels. Due to the differences in effects and modes of actions of various immunoactive substances presented herein, a common mechanism for their cytoprotective effects cannot be formulated at this stage. Levamisole and cyanidanol may protect cells against necrosis by acting as free radical scavengers. MDP and its analogs reduce carbon tetrachloride-elevated (CCl4) lipid peroxides and their protective effects are primarily on hepatic cytoplasmic membranes where lipid peroxidation and calcium homeostasis interact. MDP reduced CCl4- elevated calcium in both intact hepatocytes and in the post microsomal supernatant suggest that the influx of extracellular calcium across plasma membrane is affected. Elevations of intracellular calcium above a threshold are involved in: the stimulation of Ca2+-sensitive enzymes such as phospholipase A2, endonucleases and proteases, the conversion of xanthine dehydrogenase to xanthine oxidase and the formation of free radicals, all of which disturb biomembranes. MDP and its analogs, in a specific dose range, may act to maintain intracellular calcium within physiological ranges. Highly complex cellular signalling systems, including calcium, are involved in the explanation of the mechanism of the immunosuppressive effect of CsA and tacrolimus. The hepatoprotective effects of these selective immunosuppressive agents, however, are independent of the inhibition of T-cell activation. The cyclophilin and tacrolimus binding proteins of the mitochondria are the receptors for these compounds and play a key role in the regulation of mitochondrial permeability transition pores. CsA or tacrolimus inhibition of mitochondrial permeability transition pores does not require interaction with calcineurin, indicating a dissociation between immunosuppression and mitochondrial protection. The involvement of intracellular or intramitochondrial proteins in the modulation of mitochondrial permeability transition pores with the creation of a partially impermeable state for Ca2+ movement in drug-treated mitochondria and the dissociation of this effect from immunomodulatory actions potentially offers new and promising approaches for the development of new pharmacologicals targeted at therapeutic intervention. Clinical trials of these drugs as hepatoprotective agents are limited. Use of CsA in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis and autoimmune chronic hepatitis and in cirrhotic animal models produced by chronic administration of CCl4 have yielded encouraging results. It seems that this class of compounds may be of substantial benefit in liver protection against many pathological conditions where disturbance in mitochondrial function and in Ca2+ homeostasis appear to be prerequisites for cell injury.","BCG; Cyanidanol; Cyclosporine A; Levamisole; Muramyl dipeptide; Tacrolimus","calcium ion; carbon tetrachloride; catechin; cyclosporin A; endonuclease; free radical; galactosamine; immunomodulating agent; levamisole; n acetylmuramylalanyl dextro isoglutamine; phospholipase A2; proteinase; scavenger; tacrolimus; xanthine dehydrogenase; xanthine oxidase; biliary cirrhosis; calcium cell level; calcium homeostasis; chronic active hepatitis; clinical trial; drug mechanism; human; immunomodulation; immunopharmacology; lipid peroxidation; liver injury; liver mitochondrion; liver protection; liver transplantation; nonhuman; priority journal; review; T lymphocyte activation; Adjuvants, Immunologic; Animals; Humans; Liver; Liver Diseases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031847423

It is shown that a reason for the oscillation is the instability of the gas combustion front to a temperature gradient in a solid phase. This gradient is formed naturally in the porous matrix as the filtration combustion front propagates through the porous medium in a lowvelocity regime or is set up artificially in the wall of a tube. Quantitative results are obtained by numerical simulation. A simple theoretical interpretation of the phenomenon is developed on the basis of a model with a fixed temperature gradient in the solid phase. The region of the oscillatory instability of combustion in the ""particle (tube) diameter-gas flow velocity"" plane for the methane-air mixture is determined. The oscillations occur in the restricted range of gas flow velocities, for a ratio between the particle (tube) diameter and critical size from 1/4 to 1, whereas the oscillation frequency varies from 2 to 300 Hz. Peculiarities of the phase portrait of oscillations are discussed. It is shown that there is a close analogy between the problem of determining the position of gas combustion front with a given temperature profile in the solid and the classical problem of determination of the laminar flame velocity in a tube with a constant wall temperature. For the case under consideration, the region of oscillatory combustion corresponds to the unstable low-velocity branch of the dependency of the flame position on the gas flow rate. The results of experiments with hollow tubes and tubes filled with spheres of alumina are in good agreement with the theory.",,"Flame research; Gases; Mathematical models; Mixtures; Oscillations; Porous materials; Gas mixtures; Oscillatory combustion; Combustion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032286622

Quantitative palaeoclimatic reconstructions from Pliocene pollen data of the Mediterranean region cannot be based on conventional modern analogue techniques, as individual Pliocene pollen spectra contain taxa representing temperate, warm-temperate and subtropical plants that do not grow together today. Instead, we propose a new method that uses a climatic amplitude method modified to take partially into account the relative abundances of the taxa. We applied this method to the Pliocene Garraf 1 palynological sequence from Catalonia, which provides a long continuous record of climatic change from 5.3 Ma to the Early Pleistocene. We estimate that annual temperatures were 1 to 5°C higher than today and the annual precipitation 400 to 1000 mm higher than today prior to the beginning of the late Cenozoic glacial-interglacial cycles. In contrast, temperature and precipitation both fell sharply during the glacial phases of the earliest glacial-interglacial cycles.","Climate tolerance of plants; Climatic reconstruction; Mediterranean region; Pliocene; Pollen","glacial-interglacial cycle; paleoclimate; paleotemperature; palynology; Pliocene; Mediterranean Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032533125

These two models represent typical flat roofs of urban houses, built in Montreal between 1930 and 1970. The insulating strategy consists of packing cellulose fiber to a density of approximately 4 lb/ft3 (67 kg/m3) in a single cavity roof between the roof planking and the ceiling plaster. The goal of the test program was to determine the performance of the assembly in terms of the risk of moisture accumulation in the roof assembly. The physical setup is a full-scale mock-up of the most common shallow flat roofs found in the Montreal area. The selection of the physical characteristics of the two test huts was based on the characteristics of 500 residential buildings. The two roof assemblies had different thicknesses, with one having 8 in. (200 mm) of insulation and the other 14 in. (350 mm). Each hut contained five roof cavities—one reference cavity without insulation and four insulated. One of the insulated cavities was sealed with polyurethane foam at all of its bypasses and was hence subjected to little or no air leakage, while the other three cavities were exposed to both diffusion and air exfiltration conditions. The testing protocol was developed to reproduce wetting conditions slightly higher than typically found in these houses. The humidity transfer was monitored using three methods: moisture content sensors in wood, relative humidity sensors in the insulation, and gravimetry for wood and cellulose specimens. The construction and the data collection are described in this paper. The difficulties in monitoring moisture transfer over long periods of time are also discussed. Major results of the six-and-a-half month test program using seven simulated climatic conditions are presented. Wetting and drying curves for roof cavities are presented, and exposure time to moisture is compiled and presented. The reliability of the test procedure is discussed. This paper shows that the developed procedure permitted the assessment of the net moisture accumulation and the moisture exposure level after one complete wetting/drying cycle with precisely known conditions. © 1998 American Society of Heating, Refrigeration, and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE).

The strategy would address the need for further emission reductions within Canada as well as the need for further emission reductions in the United States for those sources and pollutants that result in continuing negative impacts from acid deposition in Canada. The strategy would be based on an assessment of the progress made in existing programs and the adequacy of programs in Canada and in the United States to protect the Canadian environment. A multi-stakeholder Task Group established for developing the strategy, presented their report and recommendations to Ministers. Key findings show that acid rain continues to threaten sensitive aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems in eastern Canada, in spite of significant progress in reducing emissions of sulphur dioxide, the main pollutant responsible for acid rain. Their report estimates that, even after full implementation of Canadian and US emission controls, large parts of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia will continue to receive twice the amount of acid that they can tolerate. The lack of lake recovery and continued loss of essential nutrients from forest soils are likely to continue as long as acid deposition continues to exceed the ecosystem tolerance levels. The Task Group looked at benefits and costs of several emission reduction scenarios and made a number of recommendations. This paper summarizes the report and it concludes that, though the multi-stakeholder process was useful in drawing recommendations from the information presented to them, development of a strategy on acid rain is a political decision.","Aquatic ecosystems; Atmospheric deposition; Canada; Forests; Multi-stakeholder strategy; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040682255

Fitting the calculated rate constants for HF elimination from RRKM theory to the experimental values provided threshold energies, E0, of 73 kcal/mol for CF3CH2CF3 and 62 kcal/mol for CF3CH2CH3. Comparing these threshold energies to those for CF3CH3 and CF3CH2Cl illustrates that replacing the hydrogen of CF3CH3 with CH3 lowers the E0 by 6 kcal/mol and replacing with CF3 or Cl raises the E0 by 5 and 8 kcal/mol, respectively. The CF3 substituent, an electron acceptor, increases the E0 an amount similar to Cl, suggesting that chlorine substituents also prefer to withdraw electron density from the β-carbon. As the HF transition state forms, it appears that electron density flows from the departing hydrogen to the β-carbon and from the β to the α-carbon, to the α-carbon from its substituents, but the α-carbon releases most of the incoming electron density to the departing fluorine. The present work supports this scenario because electron-donating substituents, such as CH3, on either carbon would reduce the E0 as they aid the flow of negative charge, while electron-withdrawing substituents such as Cl, F, and CF3 would raise the E0 for HF elimination because they hinder the flow of electron density.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0011713121

This site-specific experimentation has also led to the development of various dynamic modelling approaches through which the consequences of impacts over time can be assessed. Similarly, throughout Europe, there has been extensive collection of regional data on 'environmental capital' resulting in the production of wide area mapping of environmental quality (soils, land use etc). The aim of theDYNAMO was to integrate data and models, specifically; (1) to enhance the existing process based models to evaluate the impacts of multiple drivers of environmental change; (2) the evaluate these models at intensively studied (and manipulated) catchments and stands; (3) to scale up in time from observations collected over several years to predict the long term impacts over decades, and (4) to scale up in space from the individual site level to regional, National, and European scale. The project aims to develop and enhance regional modelling approaches so that European scale impacts of acidic deposition, land use (forestry practices) and global change can be determined without compromising process level understanding of ecosystem function.

The state of the art is such that material choice is heavily dependent on process type, so that, except in a very few cases, the realized prototypes can only give, to the end-user, information about shape and design, or represent no more than a single step in a rapid prototyping process (as in the case of models in polycarbonate, produced with SLS techniques for quick casting). The problem is more acute for injection of plastic materials, because of the large number of available raw materials. In such cases, the only way to obtain a functional prototype, i.e. one produced both with the chosen material and injection method, consists of the realization of a test mold. Note that even though techniques such as high speed milling do indeed reduce the time-to-market, they however, weigh heavily on the budget. This project demonstrates that it is possible, for the case of thermoplastic products, to eliminate the intrinsic limitations that derive from the restricted choice of available materials for rapid prototyping. A process has been implemented which allows injection of different thermoplastic materials into a mold, realized with ceramic powder not yet sinterized. Practical results show that it is possible to shape a thermoplastic object in the desired form without costly mechanical processing. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science S.A.

The cell's performance is investigated as a function of the thickness of cloths with different macrostructures. The reasons of a voltage dip at fluorocarbon-lithium cell starting are considered. The voltage dip in the case of the fluorocarbon-cloth cathodes is shown to be caused by their high ohmic resistance, which limits the reaction zone, and the subsequent expansion of the working area as the conducting carbon forms during discharge. To improve the discharge conditions, it is proposed to treat fluorocarbon cloths with colloidal graphite that has a high specific surface area.

EPA and some of the Northeast States are now trying to use two of those mechanisms to address ozone air quality problems that they believe are caused (or significantly contributed to) by transported regional ozone pollution from sources in the Midwest and Southeast. Specifically, eight of the Northeast States are using the Clean Air Act's Section 126(b) petition process to force reduction in NOx emissions from sources in the Midwest and Southeast, while EPA is moving forward to address interstate ozone pollution concerns through the use of the so-called 'SIP call' notice process under Section 110(k)(5) of the Act. This paper examines the legal basis for using either of these statutory mechanisms for addressing interstate ozone pollution concerns. In particular, it evaluates the changes that Congress made in 1990 to the Clean Air Act's ozone and interstate transport of pollution provisions. It then looks at how EPA and the Northeast states are trying to use both the Section 126(b) petition process and the Section 110(k)(5) SIP call process to effectuate the regional ozone reduction programs that they support. And, finally, it questions whether - in light of statutory changes made in 1990 - EPA and the petitioning Northeast states are justified in so proceeding.",,"Air quality; Laws and legislation; Ozone; Particulate emissions; Standards; Clean air act; State implementation plan; Air pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18544402510

K7L 3N6, Canada","The Star and Island Lake plutons of the Central metavolcanic blet, La Ronga domain, host a variety of barren and auriferous quartz veins in northeast-trending shear zones (040° 80° NW). Shear zones are coincident with competency contrasts in the plutons, which may be attributed to the northeast-trending boundary of igenous phase changes, or the presence of northeast-trending dikes. Veins range from 30 cm to 2 m wide, up to hundreds of meters long, and exhibit a discontinuous pinch and swell nature common to most shear zone-hosted mesothermal quartz veins. Barren veins are paragenetically simple, quartz being the dominant hydrothermal mineral with sparse microcline of variable origin. Muscovite, a common gangue mineral in augiferous veins, is rare in barren veins; in barren veins its occurrence is correlated with slightly elevated gold values. Quartz microtextures indicate incremental vein emplacement and deformation in a dynamic environment. Dynamic recrystallization (subgrain formation &gt; recovery rate) is the dominant ductile deformation mechanism. Macro- and microfractures, preserved as veins and planar arrays of fluid inclusions, are a result of episodic brittle failure. The cyclic nature of these events suggests in turn fluid pressure cycling in the brittle-ductile transition. Regionally, veins have a bimodal distribution of δ 1O quartz values with barren and auriferous veins occupying both populations. Excepting the Jasper mine, on both a regional and band sample scale, there is no shift in isotopic composition of vein quartz with increased ductile deformation. In fact the majority of the veins are remarkably homogeneous with respect to δ 18O quartz. Petrographically, fluid inclusions in barren veins are identical to those described in auriferous veins and exhibit temperatures of total homogenization similar to those of inclusions in auriferous veins. Compositionally, fulid inclusions in barren veins have similar wt percent NaCl and bulk CO 2 as auriferous veins; however, an important distinction is that auriferous veins may have up to 30 mole percent CH 4, a phase absent in barren veins. Similarities between auriferous and barren veins such as field relationships, microstructures, stable isotopes, and fluid inclusions are interpreted to indicate a broad temporal contemporanity of auriferous and barren fluids. Distinct mineral paragenesis and CH 4 content may represent different redox states of barren and auriferous fluids. Lack of reduced carbon species in barren veins may reflect an oxidizing fluid with few reduced sulfur ligands capable of transporting gold.",,"gold; mineralization; quartz; vein (geology); Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032419596

Nutrient cycles in such an environment are likely to be regulated by interactions between topographically determined climate and plant species composition. We investigated variation in plant and soil components of internal N cycling across topographic gradients of dry, moist, and wet alpine tundra meadows at Niwot Ridge, Colorado. We expected that plant production and N cycling would increase from dry to wet alpine tundra meadows, but we hypothesized that variation in N turnover would span a proportionately greater range than productivity, because of feedbacks between plants and soil microbial processes that determine N availability. Plant production of foliage and roots increased over topographic sequences from 280 g · m-2 · yr-1 in dry meadows to 600 g · m-2 · yr-1 in wet meadows and was significantly correlated to soil moisture. Contrary to our expectation, plant N uptake for production increased to a lesser degree, from 3.9 g N · m-2 · yr-1 in dry meadows to 6.8 g N · m-2 · yr-1 in wet meadows. In all communities, the belowground component accounted for the majority of biomass, production, and N use for production. Allocation belowground also differed among communities, accounting for 70% of total production and 80% of N use for production in dry meadows compared to 55% of production and 65% of N use for production in moist meadows. Variation in microbial processes was highly related to soil moisture, and we found very consistent relationships among microbial respiration, gross N mineralization, and N immobilization among communities. These results indicate that the topographic soil moisture gradient is in fundamental control of the patterns of N turnover among communities and that differences in plant species do not appear to be as important.","Alpine tundra; Microbial activity; Net primary production; Nitrogen cycling; Nitrogen transformations; Root production; Topographic gradient","biomass allocation; nitrogen cycle; primary production; topographic effect; tundra; Colorado; Front Range; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031714967

Pursuant to the CAAA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency promulgated its Transportation Conformity Rule (TCR). To comply with the conformity rule, metropolitan planning organizations (MPOs) must coordinate their long-range regional transportation plans (RTPs) and short-term transportation improvement programs (TIPs) with state implementation plans (SIPs) to achieve the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Conformity is achieved if the RTPs and TIPs show that their emissions do not exceed the emissions budgets of SIPs. If emissions exceed these budgets, then MPOs must show that transportation control measures (TCMs) will be implemented as scheduled to earn emission reduction credits (ERCs). This paper reviews planning practice to determine how the TCR has been implemented at state and local levels. Based on this review, the paper identifies recent problems and lessons learned by planners. The paper then argues that ERCs are not an appropriate performance indicator of policy effectiveness.

Some of these agricultural operations experiencing the increased level of scrutiny are grain elevators, confined animal feeding operations (CAFO's), cattle feedlots, and cotton gins. Cotton gins across the cotton belt emit particulate matter as a consequence of pneumatic conveying systems used to convey seed cotton, seed and gin trash. Particulate matter (PM) less than 10 (EPA, 1987) and 2.5 micrometers (EPA, 1997), referred to as PM10 and PM2.5 are regulated pollutants with corresponding National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS). Some cotton gins are having to obtain operating permits from their respective SAPRA for the first time. Other gins are being forced by SAPRAs to reduce their PM emission rates in order to comply with lower allowable emission rates (AER). Some are in the dilemma of choosing the appropriate air pollution abatement equipment that will allow them to comply with SAPRA regulations. Each SAPRA is approaching the regulation of air pollution associated with cotton gins differently. The amount of money that a cotton gin has to invest in air pollution control, in order to achieve compliance with air pollution regulations, reduces the profit margin of the ginning operation. Presently, the number of viable operating gins in the U.S. has declined and the imposition of expensive controls to comply with SAPRA rules and regulations may continue or accelerate this trend. The goal of this research is to develop procedures that can be used by the ginning community across the cotton belt to comply with SAPRA rules and regulations while minimizing the cost of compliance.",,"air; conference (Beltwide Cotton); cotton; ginning; pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032458435

In a ferroelectric cathode, electrons are emitted when the spontaneous polarization is rapidly changed by a pulsed electric field applied across the ferroelectric. When no additional voltage is applied to a planar diode gap, emission current densities are on the order of approximately 1 A/cm2. When an additional field is applied to the gap, we have measured current densities of up to 100 A/cm2.

Thermoacoustic instability which is frequently observed in combustion systems with high power density, when burning close to the lean flammability limit, or using exhaust gas recirculation to meet more stringent emission regulations, etc. Its occurrence and/or means to mitigate them passively lead to performance degradation such as reduced combustion efficiency, high local heat transfer rates, increase in the mixture equivalence ratio or system failure due to structural damage. This paper reports on our study of the origin of thermoacoustic instability, its dependence on system parameters and the means of actively controlling it. We have developed an analytical model of thermoacoustic instability in premised combustors. The model combines a heat release dynamics model constructed using the kinematics of a premixed flame stabilized behind a perforated plate with the linearized conservation equations governing the system acoustics. This formulation allows model based controller design. In order to test the performance of the analytical model, a numerical solution of the partial differential equations governing the system has been carried out using the principle of harmonic separation and focusing on the dominant unstable mode. This leads to a system of ODEs governing the thermofluid variables. Analytical predictions of the frequency and growth rate of the unstable mode are shown to be in good agreement with the numerical simulations as well as with those obtained using experimental identification techniques when applied to a laboratory combustor. We use these results to confirm the validity of the assumptions used in formulating the analytical model. A controller based on the minimization of a cost function using the LQR technique has been designed using the analytical model and implemented on a bench top laboratory combustor.

The contribution of anthropogenic sources to regional budgets of these greenhouse gases are estimated on the basis of these data. Large differences between mixing ratios of CO2 and CH4 measured in Krakow and at Kasprowy Wierch are observed as result of heavy local emission. In the case of methane, the calculated mean isotopic composition of local sources in Krakow (δ13C=-54‰) is close to values from direct gas network measurements (δ13C=-54.3‰), leading to the conclusion that the main anthropogenic source of methane in Krakow is leaks in the city gas network. In the case of CO2, however, at least three components must be considered (continental background, biospheric and anthropogenic). The measurement of δ18O as an additional parameter besides concentration and δ13C is helpful in distinguishing between these components.",,"atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; conference proceedings; isotopic composition; Romania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032323242

Natural gas is injected above the primary burners to produce a slightly-fuel rich zone where NOx is reduced by about 60%. Overfire air completes the gas combustion. Advanced Gas Reburn (AGR) is a synergistic integration of reburning and injection of a nitrogen agent (N-Agent) to achieve enhanced NOx emissions control. Rather than optimizing GR for maximum NOx reduction, the GR system is tuned to set up conditions which optimize the NOx reduction via N-Agent injection. The temperature window for N-Agent NOx reduction is significantly broader and deeper than that for conventional N-Agent injection (Selective Non-Catalytic Reduction). The combined effects of the two stage emissions control increases NOx control to nominally 85%. Advanced Gas Reburning (AGR) was installed as an upgrade to a commercial GR system on a 105 MW tangentially-fired utility boiler at New York State Electric and Gas Corporation's Greenidge Station. Both the commercial GR system and the AGR upgrade were installed in a Spring 1996 outage. Following startup, a compliance test for GR was conducted to confirm that NOx was reduced to less than 0.3 lb/106 Btu, meeting the commercial guarantee. Parametric testing was conducted during 1997, and long term testing is planned for the 1998 ozone season. This paper presents the initial results, including NOx control and impacts on boiler performance, of the first full-scale application of AGR.",,"Air pollution control; Combustion; Gas emissions; Natural gas; Nitrogen oxides; Advanced gas reburning; Boilers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031673299

In the past, the only available laser technology capable of providing, in a compact transmitter package, the required single-frequency laser power for long range laser vibration sensing against unenhanced targets, was CO2 laser technology. Recent developments in laser transmitter technology have opened up the possibility of using solid state lasers operating in the eyesafe region (wavelength &gt; 1.4 μm) as the transmitter in future long range laser vibration sensors. This paper discusses some of the factors which must be considered in selecting a laser transmitter source for such systems. These factors include vibration measurement sensitivity at the required operating ranges, atmospheric extinction, pointing and tracking requirements, atmospheric turbulence, and eye safety. We conclude that selection of the operating wavelength and transmitter technology must be tailored to each individual application, and should not be presumed to be a foregone conclusion.","Atmospheric extinction; Atmospheric turbulence; Eye safety; Eyesafe; Ladar; Laser radar; Laser vibration sensing; Microdoppler; Speckle; Target identification","Atmospheric turbulence; Carbon dioxide lasers; Eye protection; Radar target recognition; Solid state lasers; Speckle; Transmitters; Laser vibration sensing; Optical radar",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032349830

The calibrated models were used in a policy-oriented framework to predict the long-term soil acidification of these background forest sites, given different scenarios of future deposition of S and N. Emphasis was put on deriving realistic site-specific scenarios for the model applications. The deposition was calculated with EMEP transfer matrices and official emissions for the target years 2000, 2005 and 2010. The alternatives for S deposition were current reduction plans and maximum feasible reductions. For N, the NO(x) and NH(y) depositions were frozen at the present level. For NO(x), a reduction scenario of flat 30% reduction from present deposition also was utilized to demonstrate the possible effects of such a measure. The three models yielded generally consistent results. The 'Best prediction'-scenario (including the effects of the second UN/ECE protocol for reductions of SO2 emissions and present level for NO(x)-emissions), resulted in many cases in a stabilization of soil acidification, although significant improvements were not always shown. With the exception of one site, the 'Maximum Feasible Reductions' scenario always resulted in significant improvements. Dynamic models are needed as a complement to steady-state techniques for estimating critical loads and assessing emission reduction policies, where adequate data are available.","Acidification; Emission; MAGIC; Model; Nitrogen; SAFE; SMART; Sulfur","Atmospheric deposition; Soil acidification; Acidity; Ammonium compounds; Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Matrix algebra; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Public policy; Sulfur; Sulfur dioxide; Vegetation; Soil pollution control; nitrogen; sulfur; acidification; environmental policy; modeling; nitrogen; sulfur; acidification; article; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; europe; forest; model; nonhuman; soil pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032126404

The purpose of the present study was to determine, in the awake state, the effect of prolonged (minutes, hours) caudal M neuronal dysfunction on eupneic breathing and CO2 sensitivity. Dysfunction was created by ejecting excitatory amino acid receptor antagonists or a neurotoxin on the VLM surface through guide tubes chronically implanted bilaterally on a 10- to 12-mm2 portion of the caudal M VLM surface of 12 goats. Unilateral and bilateral ejections (1 μl) of selective antagonists for N-methyl-D-aspartic acid or non-N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors had no significant effect on eupneic breathing or CO2 sensitivity. Unilateral ejection of a nonselective excitatory amino acid receptor antagonist generally had no effect on eupneic breathing or CO2 sensitivity. However, bilateral ejection of this antagonist resulted in a significant 2-Torr hypoventilation during eupnea and a significant reduction in CO2 sensitivity to 60 ± 9% of control. Unilateral ejection of the neurotoxin kainic acid initially stimulated breathing; however, breathing then returned to near control with no incidence of apnea. After the kainic acid ejection, CO2 sensitivity was reduced significantly to 60 ± 7% of control. We conclude that in the awake state a prolonged dysfunction of caudal M VLM neurons results in compensation by other mechanisms (e.g., carotid chemoreceptors, wakefulness) to maintain near-normal eupneic breathing, but compensation is more limited for maintaining CO2 sensitivity.","Excitatory amino acid receptors; Regulation of breathing; Ventrolateral medulla","2 amino 5 phosphonovaleric acid; 6 nitro 7 sulfamoylbenzo[f]quinoxaline 2,3 dione; alpha amino 3 hydroxy 5 methyl 4 isoxazolepropionic acid; carbon dioxide; excitatory amino acid receptor; kainic acid; kynurenic acid; n methyl dextro aspartic acid; animal experiment; article; chemoreceptor; goat; lung gas exchange; medulla oblongata; neuromodulation; neurotransmission; nonhuman; priority journal; respiration control; wakefulness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031884302

Recent long-term measurements of NO2 and NH3 fluxes to semi-natural vegetation have shown that rates of NH3 deposition exceed those of NO2, typically by an order of magnitude. Incorporating the results of these dry deposition measurements in regional deposition budgets shows that the inputs of reduced nitrogen contribute the dominant fraction of the total nitrogen inputs in most regions of the UK. The results are illustrated by comparing the atmospheric mass-budget for oxidized nitrogen over the UK. Of the annual UK emissions of NO(x), amounting to 780 kt N (Salway et al., 1997), only 5% is dry deposited to terrestrial surfaces within the country while 15% is wet deposited, whereas for the reduced nitrogen, 42% of emissions (of the 260 kt N, Salway et al., 1997) are dry deposited and 46% are wet deposited. Even more striking are the relative contributions of oxidized and reduced nitrogen to semi-natural vegetation, which is a particularly efficient sink for NH3. The species composition of semi-natural vegetation is also regarded as very sensitive to nitrogen inputs. The distribution of nitrogen deposition among different land uses shows that the annually of which 78% is reduced nitrogen. The other land uses receive about 15 kg N average input to forest in the UK is 33 kg N ha-1 ha-1 of nitrogen of which between 55% and 65% is NH(x).

Indeed some of the information used at a regional level has a spatial representation (e.g. district heating, electricity grid, natural gas network, traffic, public transport, etc.). We have defined a model structure that allows spatial modelling through the use of integer programming techniques in association with a linkage to a geographical information system. The energy model then becomes a part of an integrated interactive Decision Support System, allowing the decision maker to assess the consequences of the energy policy choices on air pollution and on population exposure to health risk factors. The model is currently in its implementation phase for the Canton of Geneva, Switzerland.

Similar maps were obtained for 10 embedded IRAS sources with Sv(100 μm) &gt; Sv(60 μm)-and L ∼ 200 L⊙, which are possible evolutionary precursors of Herbig Ae/Be stars. Single far-infrared sources were found in most maps. The embedded sources have positions in agreement with those of the IRAS PSC, but some of the Herbig Ae/Be stars are offset significantly from the position of peak far-infrared emission. For all objects where it was possible to obtain 100 μm flux densities, they are consistent with those observed by IRAS, but derived 50 μm flux densities are larger than expected. The far-infrared maps reveal that objects in at least 17 of 19 emission regions are significantly extended at the: 30″-40″ resolution of the Kuiper Airborne Observatory at 100 μm. Only sources associated with AB Aur and possibly IRAS 05338-0624 have unresolved far-infrared emission. Detailed analyses of the flux densities and positions from our maps suggest the far-infrared emission in regions with Herbig Ae/Be stars may not immediately surround these stars in all cases. Instead, far-infrared emission from these objects may originate from dust heated externally by the Herbig stars, or from dust heated internally by other sources. For other objects arguably surrounded by far-infrared emission, the Herbig stars or embedded IRAS objects have similar mean deconvolved sizes (i.e., 0.10-0.15 pc), but possibly have different mean deconvolved shapes (i.e., aspect ratios). Thus, far-infrared emission here may originate from flattened dust envelopes; the appearance of a far-infrared object as either a Herbig Ae/Be star or an embedded IRAS source may be merely a matter of viewing orientation. © 1998.

These emission rates are calculated based on fuel consumption to remove any uncertainties based on tunnel dilution rates or air circulation. The results show carbon monoxide emissions rates of 130 g L-1 of gasoline-equivalent fuel burned and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions of 9.1 g L-1. These values are higher than predicted by the baseline version of California's EMFAC 7G emissions inventory program but are within the coemission rate range of 108 ± 25 g L-1 reported by roadside remote sensing studies in Los Angeles [Singer, B.

Fine particulate emissions within the tunnel consist largely of carbonaceous material accompanied by a significant amount of ammonium nitrate apparently formed by gas-to-particle conversion processes within the tunnel atmosphere.

Steady state, photon counting fluorescence spectroscopy directly established that rat liver ACBP bound 18-carbon cis- and trans-parinaroyl-CoA, K(d) = 7.03 ± 0.95 and 4.40 ± 0.43 nM. Time- resolved fluorometry revealed that ACBP-bound parinaroyl-CoAs had high rotational freedom within the single, relatively hydrophobic (ε <32), binding site. Tyr and Trp fluorescence dynamics demonstrated that apo-ACBP was an ellipsoidal protein (axes of 15 and 9 Å) whose conformation was altered by oleoyl-CoA in the holo-ACBP as shown by a 2-Å decrease of ACBP hydrodynamic diameter and increased Trp segmental motions. Thus, native liver ACBP binds > 14-carbon fatty acyl-CoAs with nanomolar affinity at a single binding site.

Special attention was paid to the relationship between the NOx emission levels and the lifted flames. In the coflowing air with temperature higher than the autoignition temperature, the flame was stabilized in far liftoff distance higher than the attached flame length. The NOx emission levels can be reduced remarkably by the far-lifted flames. When the liftoff height exceeded the attached flame length, the NOx emission levels rapidly decreased to 10% of that of the attached flames under the same coflowing air conditions. The low NOx emission level of the far-lifted flame was due to the decrease in flame temperature of the lean premixture formed at the flame base. The liftoff height changed with the air temperature and the fuel mass fraction of the jet. As the fuel was diluted by nitrogen, the rapid decrease of the NOx emission level by the far-lifted flame occurred in the higher temperature airflow. Also, the liftoff height at the rapid decrease became lower as the fuel mass fraction decreased. Compared with data in the literature, the local equivalence ratio at the critical liftoff base was between 1.0 and 1.3.

Between 1973 and 1993, the national government continued to improve highway BR364 connecting the area to Brazil's south-central region and established a colony in Theobroma. During this period, 98% of the deforestation occurred. Some 1800 settler families continue to convert forest into pasture in a system based on the slash-and-burn agriculture and dual-purpose cattle production. Trends in carbon emissions and plant species losses during the 20-year history of Theobroma were analyzed by combining observed shifts in land-use types with estimates for the carbon stocks and plant species richness of each of these types. Carbon stocks declined from about 200 t ha-1 in the forest to 28 t ha-1 in the pasture and of 326 plant species encountered in the forest, only 20 remained in pastures (along with 66 species not found in forests). The effects of converting more than 93 000 ha of forest into other uses over 20 years include approximate losses of 14 million tons of C to the atmosphere and substantial losses of plant species. Land use alternatives that would store more C include agroforestry and - given the strong incentives for settlers to convert lands into pasture - improving pasture management or developing silvopastoral systems. Plant species conservation may be improved with proposed ways to add private value to the forest.","Carbon emissions; Plant biodiversity; Slash-and-burn agriculture; Tropical deforestation","carbon emissions; deforestation; nature-society relations; plant species; species loss; Brazil; Rondonia; Theobroma; Bos taurus; Rondonia; Theobroma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032507626

The photostability of (IX) and (X) in the solid state is attributed to the narrow reaction cavity of the triisopropylphenylcarbonyl moiety, i.e. the intramolecular movements of isopropyl groups in the triisopropylphenyl plane toward the carbonyl C atom are suppressed by intermolecular close contacts.

Sciences, 113 Sofia, Bulgaria","One important ionospheric tool currently missing is a successful storm-time prediction model. The most obvious, long-lived, coherent features of the ionospheric response to a geomagnetic storm are the deep ion depletions ('negative phase'), that typically develop in the summer hemisphere during the driven phase of a storm, and persist well into the recovery. An empirical model is presented that is designed to capture the long-lived ion depletions in the midlatitude summer hemisphere. The algorithm is based on a new index: the integral of the hemispheric auroral power as specified by the TIROS/NOAA measurements of precipitating particles. The integral sums the auroral power over the previous 30 hours with a weighting function. The index is designed to be a measure of the change in neutral composition induced by the magnetospheric sources. Recent advances in physically-based modeling of the upper atmosphere have improved understanding of the processes controlling the ionospheric response to geomagnetic storms, and confirm the theory that the 'negative phase' is mainly caused by changes in neutral composition. This understanding from physically-based modeling has guided us in the choice of a relatively simple empirical expression to capture the ionospheric response to storms. The algorithm assumes a non-linear relationship between the F-region ionospheric response and the index. The algorithm improves on climatological predictions by reducing storm-time ionospheric variance to values close to pre-storm levels.","Geomagnetic storm; Ionosphere","geomagnetic storm; ionosphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032450358

Medium variants from all the organizations show excellent agreement with respect to many features of future world population growth. It appears that little would be gained by obtaining additional regional projections made by governments or organizations other than those listed above. In general, the new range of population projections that are candidates for forthcoming IPCC emissions scenarios are narrower and lower than the previous IPCC IS92 population range: a reflection of updated information on the decline of fertility rates in developing countries and the incorporation of a plausible correlation between mortality rates and fertility rates within the IIASA 'rapid' and 'slow' demographic transition variants. Comments are made on the schematic approach of forecasting CO2 emissions using multiplicative identities such as 'IPAT' (impact/emissions = population x affluence x technology). Although the unqualified IPAT model suggests that emissions should scale linearly with population, a number of caveats to this exist, the most important of which may be factor interactions. A brief review is made of conventional thinking about interactions between population growth and economic development. Correlation studies and theory suggest that population growth has a neutral or, at most, weak negative effect on economic growth. Conversely, it is well established that higher per capita incomes are well correlated with lower fertility and mortality rates in developing countries. Therefore, a plausible first-order relationship worth exploring in the next generation of IPCC scenarios is that scenarios with higher average economic growth rates in the developing world should be associated with lower fertility and mortality rates there. Calculations are presented that illustrate the effect this negative correlation could have had on the range of the older IS92 emission scenarios, assuming that all other factors are unchanged. Finally, some policy issues concerning population and global warming are reviewed in connection with the IPCC's omission of population policy discussion in its 1995 Second Assessment Report.","Climate change; Environment; Fertility rates; Greenhouse gas emissions scenarios; IIASA; IPAT; IPCC; IS92; Population; Population projections; U.S. Census Bureau; United Nations; World Bank","carbon emission; emission; global perspective; greenhouse gas; population estimation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032319980

Atmospheric concentrations of ozone, oxides of nitrogen, CO, peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), aldehydes, and organic acids were measured in the summer of 1993, before the use of ethanol fuels, and in the winters of 1994 and 1995, during the use of 10% ethanol fuel (>99%). Data showed increased levels of peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) and aldehydes in winter. The formaldehyde/acetaldehyde ratio was 1.4, indicating an anthropogenic source, and PAN and acetaldehyde levels were anti-correlated over short time periods, indicating primary acetaldehyde emissions.

Essentially, it is a risk management issue of global dimensions. Since the movement towards outright reductions via controls or tradable permits is a serious course of action contemplated by most developed countries, the authors expand in the description of the peculiarities of the forest products industry in matters of greenhouse gas (GHG) generation and reduction. Pertinent observations are made about the distinction between net and gross carbon dioxide emissions. The term `sinks' and the use of renewable and non-fossil fuels have been initially defined by the Framework Convention and the Kyoto Protocol and pending definition of important modalities on these matters could be resolved next November at Buenos Aires. The resolution of these pending matters will be of great importance for the companies of the forest industry and their input to the preparation work for Buenos Aires is indispensable. The major details of the Kyoto Protocol are reviewed in the light of their potential influence on the forest industry. Different competitive aspects involved in the exemption of developing countries from similar commitments as those for developed countries are analyzed as well as competitive advantages for certain European producers due to the `bubble' approach allowed for regions such as the European Union. The authors explore the major threats and opportunities that the Kyoto Protocol and the Administration's action plan could bring to the forest industry. In conclusion, deliberate, prompt designing of a strategic and tactical plan for the forest industry is an imperative if potential threats are to be dwarfed and hidden assets realized.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Risk assessment; Strategic planning; Kyoto protocol; Paper and pulp mills",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031623745

Stuparich, 1, I-34125 Trieste, Italy","Acetate free biofiltration (AFB) is a hemodiafiltration technique based on a buffer-free dialysate and bicarbonate infusion in the postdilution mode. The performance of AFB requires a dialysis machine equipped with an automatic control system to balance the infusion rate to that of ultrafiltration. The filters employed are usually polyacrylonitrile hollow-fiber hemodialyzers. A 145 mEq/l sodium bicarbonate solution is generally used and the infusion rate is regulated at about 8-10 liters per session to ensure optimal convective removal of toxins as well as to compensate for the bicarbonate lost in the dialysate. During AFB bicarbonate transfer results from the balance between diffusive and convective bicarbonate losses in the dialyzer and the amount of bicarbonate infused in the venous return. Thus bicarbonate supply can increase along with the rise in plasma bicarbonate concentration until a steady state is reached when the rate of infused bicarbonate equals bicarbonate losses into the dialyzer. A mild alkalosis may sometimes occur which can be avoided by slightly reducing bicarbonate concentration and/or infusion rate during the session. In spite of the large amount of sodium infused and the unusual high chloride concentration in the dialysate, no difference in the postdialysis plasma sodium levels nor in chloremia has been observed between AFB and bicarbonate dialysis. This is essentially due to the very large removal of these anions by convection (chloride and sodium) and by diffusion (sodium) into the dialyzer. Similarly the significant convective losses of calcium suggest a high dialysate calcium concentration to avoid negative intradialytic calcium balance. Polyacrylonitrile membranes, regularly employed in AFB, allow the passage of endotoxin fragments to the blood circuit in a lesser extent than other membranes. Coupled with the fact that a buffer-free dialysate and a sterile bicarbonate infusion are used AFB can be considered a highly biocompatible dialysis technique. As compared to conventional dialysis AFB allows adequate removal of small molecules and better removal of larger molecules such as β2-microglobulin. In the short run AFB is characterized by an increase in cardiovascular stability: it improves dialysis symptoms and the subjective well-being of patients. A better acid-base correction is regularly reported together with a rise in some nutritional indices like serum albumin levels. The reasons for these favorable results are not well defined yet. A number of multicenter studies on the effects of AFB have been published with quite similar results, but most of them are non-randomized, and use historical controls. Only one prospective, cross-over study comparing bicarbonate dialysis with AFB in diabetic dialysis patients is available. It concludes that in a six-month observation period with AFB it is possible to better control some metabolic aspects and to improve both treatment tolerance and patients' life quality. However, it is not known whether these positive effects may entail better long-term prognosis; moreover, comparisons between AFB and conventional dialysis were never designed to ascertain the role of the dialysis membrane from that of the other components of AFB on clinical results. Therefore, large prospective trials with long observation periods are necessary to clarify the mechanisms through which AFB might be superior to conventional dialysis as well as the impact of these techniques on long-term prognosis. In such studies other relevant factors such as rehabilitation and life quality of the patients, which have been generally neglected in previous surveys, must also be included to evaluate cost-effectiveness of this therapy.","Acetate free biofiltration (AFB); Bicarbonate dialysis; Biocompatibility; Dialysis outcome; Dialysis tolerance","acetic acid; beta 2 microglobulin; bicarbonate; calcium; chloride; endotoxin; polyacrylonitrile; serum albumin; sodium; acid base balance; alkalosis; article; artificial kidney; bicarbonate blood level; biocompatibility; biofiltration; calcium balance; cardiovascular function; chloride blood level; control system; cost effectiveness analysis; dialysate; dialysis membrane; diffusion; hemodialysis; human; nutrition; prognosis; quality of life; sodium blood level; thermodynamics; ultrafiltration; wellbeing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031824912

Its application for calculating the differential cross sections of real processes involving polarized particles is studied. In the diagonal spin basis the spin 4-vectors of particles before and after the interaction are expressed in terms of their 4-momenta. This forms a realization of the Lorentz little group, which is the same for the initial and final states. It causes the spin operators of the initial and final particles to coincide, which can be used to separate covariantly the interactions with and without change of the spin states of the particles involved in the reaction, thereby making it possible to trace the dynamics of the spin interaction. In contrast to the method of the CALCUL group and others, this approach is valid in both the massive and the massless cases. No difficulties arise in calculating the spin-flip amplitudes, and it is not necessary to introduce auxiliary vectors. For constructing the mathematical formalism used to calculate the matrix elements in the diagonal spin basis it is sufficient to know only the 4-momenta of the particles participating in the reaction. The method has been used to study the following QED processes: (1) Møller and Bhabha bremsstrahlung (e±e-→e±e-y) in the ultrarelativistic (massless) limit for the case where the initial particles and the photon are helically polarized; (2) the Compton back-scattering of photons by an intense, circularly polarized laser wave focused on a beam of longitudinally polarized ultrarelativistic electrons (e+nγ0→e+γ); (3) e+e--pair creation by a hard photon in a collision with several laser photons simultaneously (γ+nγ0→e++e-); (4) the Bethe-Heitler process in the case of emission of a linearly polarized photon by an electron, taking into account the proton recoil and form factors; (5) the reaction ep-epy, taking into account the proton polarizability in the kinematics where proton bremsstrahlung dominates; (6) the three-photon annihilation of orthopositronium (e+e-→3y).

Explosions are believed to occur in the shallower part of the magma conduit, and to be caused by the rapid and violent expansion of metastable magma-gas mixtures. The effect of increasing the exsolved quantities of H2O and CO2 gas with reduced pressure in the melt is to decrease the sound speed and density of the magma-gas mixture. This causes an acoustic decoupling of the upper and lower parts of the magma conduit. The reduced sound speed and density of the melt at shallow depths present a sharp impedance contrast, which strongly reflects acoustic energy originating at depth and traps it in the lower part of the magma conduit. Alternatively, acoustic energy originating from the upper part of the conduit remains trapped in the low-velocity region formed by the exsolved gas in the melt, and hence shallow explosions may preferentially couple into the atmosphere. Explosion signals may be triggered by an increased flow of melt at depth, and may be preceded and accompanied by vigorous mass flux transients.Theoretical modeling of acoustic and seismic signals associated with the 1996 strombolian eruption of Pavlof volcano suggests that volcanic tremor at Pavlof originates in the deeper part of the magma conduit, and is generated by random fluid oscillations in the magma flow. Explosions are believed to occur in the shallower part of the magma conduit, and to be caused by the rapid and violent expansion of metastable magma-gas mixtures. The effect of increasing the exsolved quantities of H2O and CO2 gas with reduced pressure in the melt is to decrease the sound speed and density of the magma-gas mixture. This causes an acoustic decoupling of the upper and lower parts of the magma conduit.

Correlative shaly units have recently been traced in central Nepal and as far as South Tibet, where they yielded varied brachiopod assemblages indicative of Bashkirian age. A second distinct interval of black shales, characterized by the abundance of chaetetids and directly underlying the widespread Gondwanan diamictites, has been dated as Moscovian in Spiti and represents the youngest fossiliferous horizon hitherto identified in the Upper Carboniferous of the Tethys Himalaya. The 'Chaetetid shales' are recognized also in Manang, whereas in South Tibet the stratigraphic framework still needs improved definition. These major fossiliferous black shale units, marking repeated transgressive events in the middle part of the Himalayan rift sequence, have not only major stratigraphic significance but also represent a fundamental landmark in palaeogeographic and palaeoclimatic reconstructions of Northern Gondwana. With the onset of continental rifting, arid tropical climates at the close of the Tournaisian were replaced by temperate humid conditions in the Visean-Serpukhovian, when diamictites were deposited in South Tibet. After this first cooling stage, the 'Fenestella shales' mark a widespread transgression at the very beginning of the Late Carboniferous, coupled with reduced tectonic activity and temperate to temperate-warm climates. After renewed tectonic activity during a second cooling episode, marked by local deposition of diamictites in central Nepal, the 'Chaetetid shales' represent another major transgression in the Moscovian, shortly preceding the final and most intense cooling event marked by deposition of glacio-marine diamictites in the whole Tethys Himalaya from Kashmir to South Tibet during the latest Carboniferous/earliest Permian. Two fossiliferous horizons containing very similar brachiopod faunas of early Late Carboniferous age have recently been found also in North Karakorum, at lower southern latitudes, where climatic conditions always remained temperate and there is no trace of Upper Palaeozoic glacial deposits or ice-rafted debris.",,"Carboniferous; marker bed; paleogeography; stratigraphy; Tethys; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032430315

They offer excellent packaging flexibility and thorough engine management system integration. Two different concepts were evaluated in this study. They are different in how the pressure generation and injection events are related. One used a direct principle, where the high-pressure generation and injection events occur simultaneously producing a near square injection rate profile. Another concept was based on an indirect principle, where potential energy (pressure) is first stored inside a hydraulic accumulator, and then released during injection, as a subsequent event. A falling rate shape is typically produced in this case. A unit pump, where the hydraulic intensifier is separated from the injector by a high-pressure line, and a unit injector design are considered for both concepts. Details of the injection process, including hydraulic and mechanical characteristics, were analyzed and compared. A one dimensional fuel injection simulation program was used. A summary of the mathematical model and program structure is provided and the advantages and disadvantages are outlined. Due to the different rate shapes, the two Fuel Injection System (FIS) concepts result in different calculated combustion and emission characteristics. A CFD model for three-dimensional analysis of chemically reactive flow with sprays, KIVA, was used to assess the combustion and emission characteristics of the different systems used in the study. The effect of a short injection duration on combustion and emissions was also explored. The calculated results showed an increase in the duration of heat release and soot emissions in this case. This may be attributed to the local fuel rich zones created. Each FIS concept was composed of identical major components including a hydraulic control valve, hydraulic intensifier, check valves, and nozzle. Starting from a 'generic' design, a fair comparison was possible. This paper discusses the approaches, methods, and results of the evaluation study. The final objective of the project is to design and build a prototype FIS and demonstrate its capability in a single cylinder research engine. © 1998 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Combustion; Computational fluid dynamics; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Engine cylinders; Fuels; Hydraulic accumulators; Hydraulic machinery; Potential energy; Electronic fuel injection system; Emission characteristics; Engine management systems; Heavy-duty diesel engine; Hydraulic control valves; Mechanical characteristics; Single-cylinder research engines; Three-dimensional analysis; Direct injection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072448729

Within the last years environmental legislation tried to reduce the emissions by the introduction of very tight laws. The results are impressive: Most of the car exhaust emissions like carbonmonoxid and nitrous oxides have been reduced. At this stage new emission reduction limits in Europe as well as in the United States can only be achieved if the formulation of the catalyst system is significantly changed. An increased use of precious metals and rare earth materials is the result of such a modification which succeeds in a more expensive design of the total catalyst systems. More expensive means not only cost aspects but also the environmental burdens related to the increased production of precious metals and other catalyst components. The Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) of the catalyst system which achieves the new legislation is demonstrated as well as the effects to the usage phase.

Constant US dollar prices for both metallurgical and steam coal continue to decline in the face of intense competition from international suppliers. Coal continues to lose market share in Europe where stringent environmental regulations and inroads by the natural gas industry have increasingly curtailed the demand for coal. While Asian markets still hold the best hope for increased coal usage, it is unclear how the recent Kyoto Protocol CO2 emission reduction commitments and the region's financial troubles will impact on demand. The US continues to maintain a strong position in the world's coal markets, second only to Australia.

The main aerosol source in that region is the forest natural biogenic emission. The aerosol samples were collected using stacked filter units, and were analyzed applying several analytical techniques: Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE) for the quantitative analysis of trace elements with Z > 11; Particle Induced Gamma-ray Emission (PIGE) for the quantitative analysis of Na; Ion Chromatography (IC) was used to quantify ionic contents of aerosols from the fine mode particulate samples. A reflectance technique was used in order to measure black carbon concentrations; Gravimetric analysis was used in order to determine the total atmospheric aerosol mass concentration. The comparison from PIXE and IC concentration measurements for S, K and Ca techniques were in an excellent agreement. A good agreement was also obtained for Na concentrations measured by PIGE and IC techniques. Multivariate statistical analysis was used in order to identify and characterize the sources of the atmospheric aerosol present in the sampled region. The Serra do Navio aerosol is characterized by biogenic emissions, responsible for the majority of the total fine mass concentration. A strong marine influence was also noted.

This work was performed in response to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) draft document on dioxin reassessment, which used data from sources outside the United States to estimate an emission factor of 0.8 ng-TEQ/veh-mi for the U.S. fleet. The primary objective of this work was to measure on-road chlorinated dioxin and furan emission factors from in-use vehicles operating in the United States, with emphasis on heavy-duty vehicles. The experimental approach was to measure emissions in the Fort McHenry Tunnel in Baltimore, MD. All air entering and leaving the tunnel was sampled for concentrations of dioxins and furans (during 10 24-h sampling periods). The difference between the mass of material entering and the mass of material leaving the tunnel was taken to be the amount produced by the vehicles in transit. These measurements were combined with information on vehicle counts (obtained through videotapes) and tunnel length to determine average emission factors. For the limited range of vehicle operating conditions present in the tunnel experiment, the average heavy-duty diesel emission factor determined in this study was 0.28 ± 0.13 ng-TEQ/veh-mi, a factor of 3 lower than the EPA estimate. © 1998 Air & Waste Management Association.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85012483387

The study provides baseline hydrological information for assessment of tailings pond design and management at nearby mine sites, and, notably, enables intercomparison of several field-based evaporation methods and a standard climate approach in a subarctic setting. A non-steady isotope mass balance method is applied to estimate evaporation over time intervals ranging from five days to three weeks, based on isotopic surveys of lake water, groundwater, precipitation and atmospheric moisture during the open water periods of 1991 and 1996. Use of a relatively high precision non-steady technique, in contrast to the commonly employed approach assuming steady stat, is feasible in the present setting owing to pronounced seasonal evaporative enrichment in lake water (20-30 times analytical uncertainty of δ18O). A comparative analysis reveals that the isotopic method is conservative relative to the Penman combination method, but less conservative than standard water balance, although estimates for the open water period are in agreement to within 20% in both cases. Interannual variability in evaporation is revealed to be 30-50% greater than predicted from standard pan-to-lake algorithms, and of the same order of magnitude as the annual snow water equivalent (≃155-175 mm), which has important implications for the design and management of tailings ponds in the area.",,"Mass balance method; Penman combination method; Tailings ponds; Water balance method; Evaporation; Groundwater; Isotopes; Lakes; Mining; Moisture; Snow; Tailings; Water analysis; Water pollution control; Hydrology; evaporation; lake; mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032147515

On CO infusion in perfused myocardium, the MbO2 signal at -2.76 parts per million (ppm) gradually disappears, whereas the corresponding MbCO signal emerges at -2.26 ppm, reflecting the state of Mb inhibition. Up to 76.8% MbCO saturation, myocardial O2 consumption (MV̇O2) remains constant, whereas the rate-pressure product (RPP) has already dropped to 92% of the control level. At 87.6% MbCO saturation, the lactate formation rate has increased by a factor of two, and ṀO2 begins to decline. However, the ratio CO/O2 is still 1/10, well below the inhibition threshold for cytochrome oxidase activity. The ṀO2 decline in the face of an adequate O2 supply and an unperturbed high-energy phosphate level implies that Mb may play a role in directly regulating respiration, mediated potentially by a shift in NADH/NAD.

Fuel Lean Reburn was installed on a 340 MW cyclone-fired utility boiler at ComEd's Joliet Generating Station Number 9. Fuel Lean Reburn involves the injection of 3-7% natural gas heat input via turbulent jets into the upper furnace of fossil-fueled boilers while maintaining an overall fuel lean furnace, thereby preventing excessive carbon monoxide emission and eliminating the need for downstream completion air as employed in conventional gas reburning technology. The controlled dispersion of natural gas into high NOx regions downstream of the primary combustion zone is designed to create locally fuel rich zones or eddies in which NOx reburning can take place while maintaining an overall fuel lean furnace environment. The Fuel Lean Reburn shows the potential to achieve better than a 40% reduction in NOx emissions using 7% gas heat input or less. With the elimination of downstream completion air and the use of less gas heat input than with conventional gas reburning systems, Fuel Lean Reburn systems offer lower capital and operating costs than conventional reburn systems with a moderate decrease in the NOx control potential. A Fuel Lean Reburn system was installed on Joliet Unit 6 in the Spring of 1997 with parametric and long-term performance testing taking place in the Summer of 1997.

The character of the spectrum (vibronic band positions and intensities) shows that the T1 ← S0 electronic excitation of the fluoral molecule substantially affects the orientation of the CF3 group with respect to the molecular frame and causes a pyramidal distortion of the carbonyl fragment, which is planar in the S0 state. The experimental torsional and inversion energy levels were used to determine the potential functions of internal rotation and inversion for the fluoral molecule in the T1 state; the potential barriers to internal rotation and inversion were found to be 600 and 1070 cm-1 (7.2 and 12.8 kJ/mol), respectively.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032371443

This paper attempts to bring such data to this debate. Specifically, it develops and analyzes trends in the traditional air pollutants [sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen oxides (NO x) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particulate matter (PM) and carbon monoxide (CO)] going back, in some cases, to 1900 for nationwide emissions, the 1950s for outdoor air quality, and 1940 for residential emissions per occupied household unit, a proxy for indoor air quality. These data refute conventional wisdom that, prior to federalization, states were dragging their feet and indulging in a ""race to the bottom."" In fact, pre-federalization progress in improving air quality was quite remarkable, especially in the worst problem areas. Based upon a broad review of the various social, economic, and technological factors determining environmental quality during this century, the paper shows how the stringency of controls and the order in which each pollutant was controlled were driven by affluence and technology. It suggests that states actually participate in a ""race to the top of the quality of life,"" which superficially resembles a ""race to the bottom"" at low levels of economic and technological development and a ""race to the top"" of environmental quality at high levels, approximating, under certain circumstances, a not-in-my-backyard effect.

The model treats the dense material as a rigid two-dimensional mass and heat reservoir suppressing all hydrodynamic motion in the dense material. The computer simulations and additional post-processors provide predictions for measurements including impulse given to the target, pressures at the target interface, electron temperatures and densities in the vapor-plasma plume region, and emission of radiation from the target.

We study how responses to attitudinal survey questions are interrelated, and how such responses are related to actual travel behavior using data from a survey undertaken in six capital cities in Australia in 1994. A measurement model is used to establish a set of latent attitudinal factors, and these factors are related in a structural equations model to a set of behavioral variables representing commuters' mode choice and choice of compressed work schedules, conditioned by a set of exogenous variables. Individuals with a strong environmental commitment are more likely to be female, from smaller households with fewer cars, be either under 30 years old or over 50 years old, have high household income and be highly educated. However, women are likely to view the car as a status symbol, and this attitude is conducive to choice of solo driving.

The annual pollen of Poaceae and Plantaginaceae collected in the Atlantic cities was found to be twice that in the Mediterranean sites, and the total amount of Urticaceae was higher at sites with an urban environment and subject to sea influence (Vigo, Huelva and Seville). At all the sites, the start of the main pollination periods (MPP) took place in the following order Urticaceae, Plantaginaceae and Poaceae. It was also observed that the MPP of these three pollen types began earlier in Huelva and Seville, where the mean temperatures necessary for the beginning of pollen emissions are recorded very early. Regarding the variation in pollen concentrations throughout the year, Urticaceae presented peaks of maximum concentration in March (Huelva, Seville, Vigo and Orense) and June (Santiago); Plantaginaceae in March (south) and June (north); and Poaceae in May (south) and June-July (north). At northern sites, pollen emissions of Urticaceae and Plantaginaceae continued throughout the summer, while in the south they decreased considerably from May onwards. From the allergenic point of view, the indices of reactivity described for Urticaceae and Poaceae were exceeded more often at northern sites, in particular at Vigo. The meteorological conditions associated with periods of highest pollen emission of these three herbaceous types are a rise in mean temperature, light or absent rainfall, and abundant sunshine.

We describe a study aimed at documenting greenhouse gas emissions from a local area in the High Plains of southwestern Kansas that is currently undergoing marked economic change and population increase in response to restructuring of the meat packing industry. We estimate volume and source of emissions for three greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide, and contrast the relative importance of gas emissions at the local, state, and national level. The relative amounts of greenhouse gas emissions and the processes that produce them were found to vary considerably across these three geographic scales. In the study area, agribusiness is the leading source of methane and the greatest overall contributor to greenhouse gas emissions. Utilities and the natural gas industry contributed the largest amounts of carbon dioxide, ranking second and third in overall contribution to greenhouse gas levels, respectively. The proportion of total global warming potential (GWP) contributed by CH4 is somewhat higher at the local level than at the state or national levels. Contribution to total GWP by N2O in the local area is roughly equivalent to the larger geographic areas.

Testing of models that are used to predict climate change is of such importance that no single approach will provide the necessary basis to analyze systematic errors and to withstand critical analysis. Appropriate observing systems must be relevant, global, precise, and calibratable against absolute standards. This paper describes two systems that satisfy these criteria: spectrometers that can measure thermal brightness temperatures with an absolute accuracy of 0.1 K and a spectral resolution of 1 cm-1, and radio occultation measurements of refractivity using satellites of the GPS positioning system, which give data of similar accuracy. Comparison between observations and model predictions requires an array of carefully posed tests. There are at least two ways in which either of these data systems can be used to provide strict, objective tests of climate models. The first looks for the emergence from the natural variability of a predicted climate ""fingerprint"" in data taken on different occasions. The second involves the use of high-order statistics to test those interactions that drive the climate system toward a steady state. A correct representation of these interactions is essential for a credible climate model. A set of climate model tests is presented based upon these observational and theoretical ideas. It is an approach that emphasizes accuracy, exposes systematic errors, and is focused and of low cost. It offers a realistic hope for resolving some of the contentious arguments about global change.",,"accuracy assessment; climate; model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032450418

In X-rays, a large region with reduced X-ray emission was observed enveloping the initial location of the prominence and extending to much larger heights. At the bottom of this depletion and beneath the eruptive prominence, an X-ray arcade formed, progressively spreading from south to north along the limb. This is the first time a direct detailed comparison is made between coronal dimming and a prominence eruption. We were able to confirm that the coronal dimming is indeed a near-surface manifestation of the coronal mass ejection (CME). The orientation of the structures involved did not allow the observations of the coronal cavity, but all the other substructures of the CME could be identified.

While specific impacts on different regions as well as their timing are yet uncertain, it is reasonable to suppose that unilateral voluntary action by individual countries to reduce their net emissions of GHGs is unlikely. This is because significant reduction of net GHGs emissions by a single major net emitter, say, for example the EU, is unlikely to substantially slow down the rate of increase in concentration in the atmosphere because the emissions of GHGs worldwide is increasing rapidly with spreading industrialization. On the other hand, unilateral changes in energy use patterns are widely perceived to have adverse effects on a country's economic growth, consumer welfare and trade competitiveness. This perception is shared by both developing (DCs) and industrialized countries (INCs). Some major policy instruments have been assessed on the basis of experiments with the CGE model. The use of each of the policy instrument for direct GHGs regulation is promising. The results of the above experiments seem to show, that first, emission standards accomplish significant decreases in net GHGs emissions with negligible relative GDP and Welfare index changes and without major distributional impacts in the sense of relative changes in factor rewards. They seem to work through major reduction in coal and natural gas use and slight overall reduction in the use of petroleum. Second, auctioned tradeable permits also accomplish large decreases in net GHGs emissions, with, however a perceptible increase in the Welfare Index and significant distributional impacts in higher rewards to land owners and labor relative to capital owners. They appear to work primarily by expansion to the forest sector and associated increases offsets generation. Third, the use of a GHGs tax on positive net emissions of GHGs by industries accomplishes large reductions in net GHGs emissions with significant increase in GDP and the Welfare Index. The relative changes in factor rewards are also important and favor land owners over labor and capital owners. This instrument too appears to work primarily through considerable expansion of the forest sector and consequent increases offsets generation. Each of these instruments show sufficient promise as effective policy tools for GHGs reduction, that it would be advisable to conduct further research in each case. The choice between standards on the one hand, and market-based domestic regulatory instruments on the other, is not straightforward. These results need verification through further analysis. © 1998 Society for Policy Modeling.

Rapidly changing technology, increasing competition, declining public financial resources, escalating demands for accountability, changing student demographics, and broadening pleas for involvement in decision making by employees have created a period of instability in our institutions. This instability requires a change in management models. Successful community colleges in the next millennium will create organizational cultures symbolized by decentralized decision making, organizational alignment, and the ability to thrive on chaos. Victor Valley College, in California, underwent a systematic change in management direction during the first S years of this decade. A comprehensive change process of strategic planning, team leadership training, process reengineering, organizational restructuring, and college‐wide staff development was used to transform the college culture. These changes, coupled with the president's efforts to execute management principles based on personal trustworthiness, interpersonal trust, managerial empowerment, and organizational alignment, led to a dramatically improved campus culture and climate. This article, a case study in organizational transformation, discusses the strategies used to create culture change at Victor Valley College. The authors conclude their article by warning the reader that change is and will continue to be a constant in our rapidly changing world. Community college leaders will need to give continuous attention to change in order to provide the best possible educational programs and services to an ever‐changing student population. © 1998 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85023830691

This extra reactive N is readily transported through the environment, and there is increasing evidence that it is changing ecosystems through eutrophication and acidification. Rothamsted Experimental Station, UK has been involved in research on N cycling in ecosystems since its inception in 1843. Measurements of precipitation composition at Rothamsted, made since 1853, show an increase of nitrate and ammonium N in precipitation from 1 and 3 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively, in 1855 to a maximum of 8 and 10 kg N ha-1 yr-1 in 1980, decreasing to 4 and 5 kg N ha-1 yr-1 today. Nitrogen inputs via dry deposition do, however, remain high. Recent measurements with diffusion tubes and filter packs show large concentrations of nitrogen dioxide of c. 20 μg m-3 in winter and c. 10 μg m-3 in summer; the difference is linked to the use of central heating, and with variations in wind direction and pollutant source. Concentrations of nitric acid and particulate N exhibit maxima of 1.5 and 2 μg m-3 in summer and winter, respectively. Concentrations of ammonia are small, barely rising above 1 μg m-3. Taking deposition velocities from the literature gives a total deposition of all measured N species to winter cereals of 43.3 kg N ha-1 yr-1, 84% as oxidized species, 79% dry deposited. The fate of this N deposited to the very long-term Broadbalk Continuous Wheat Experiment at Rothamsted has been simulated using the SUNDIAL N-cycling model: at equilibrium, after 154 yr of the experiment and with N deposition increasing from c. 10 kg ha-1 yr-1 in 1843 to 45 kg ha-1 yr-1 today, c. 5% is leached, 12% is denitrified, 30% immobilized in the soil organic matter and 53 % taken off in the crop. The 'efficiency of use' of the deposited N decreases, and losses and immobilization increase as the amount of fertilizer N increases. The deposited N itself, and the acidification that is associated with it (from the nitric acid, ammonia and ammonium), has reduced the number of plant species on the 140-yr-old Park Grass hay meadow. It has also reduced methane oxidation rates in soil by c. 15 % under arable land and 30 % under woodland, and has caused N saturation of local woodland ecosystems: nitrous oxide emission rates of up to 1.4 kg ha-1 yr-1 are equivalent to those from arable land receiving &gt; 200 kg N ha-1 yr-1, and in proportion to the excess N deposited; measurements of N cycling processes and pools using 15N pool dilution techniques show a large nitrate pool and enhanced rates of nitrification relative to immobilization. Ratios of gross nitrification: gross immobilization might prove to be good indices of N saturation.","Air pollution; Atmospheric deposition; Mineralization; Nitrification; Nitrogen cycling; Trace gas fluxes","nitrification; nitrogen metabolism; soil degradation; United Kingdom; acidification; eutrophication; nitrogen cycling; precipitation; soil process; England; Hertfordshire; Rothamsted; UK",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642676869

In addition we measured the fugacity of CO2 in surface seawater and in the air above seawater along the cruise tracks. Between 10°N and 20°N, these measurements were repeated five times in January, March, July, November, and December 1995, and show different temporal variations of the carbonate properties in surface seawater depending upon the different regional hydrological and biological regimes. In order to estimate the relative importance of each process (physics, biology and thermodynamics) on the temporal carbon cycle in these regions, we use a 1-D process model initialized with the data from January 1995 and forced with climatological fields. The outputs of the model applied at three locations (10°N 65°E; 14.5°N 65°E; and 19°N 65°E) in the Arabian Sea are compared with US-JGOFS observations. The forcing terms and the 'standard' biological parameters reproduce the CO2 cycle at 10°N and 14.5°N. At 19°N, the 'standard' biological activity has to be reduced by a factor two to approach the observed CO2 concentrations. The model outputs predict seasons of minimum and maximum fCO2 in surface seawater at time periods where no data are available in October and May/June, respectively.","Arabian Sea; Total alkalinity; Total carbon dioxide","carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbonate; modeling; sea surface; seasonality; temporal variation; Arabian Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032431168

Such an approach was adopted as part of the ecosys modelling project to simulate the interrelated activities of anaerobic fermenters and H2-producing acetogens, of acetotrophic and hydrogenotrophic methanogens and of autotrophic methanotrophs. The simulation of these activities was based on the stoichiometries and energetics of the transformations mediated by each microbial community. Model results were tested with published data for CH4 emission during anaerobic incubation of soils amended with different plant residues. The model reproduced within experimental error observed changes with temperature in CH4 emission rates and in CH4-to-CO2 emission ratios caused by different residue amendments. These changes were driven in the model by the dynamics of growth and respiration by fermentative and methanogenic communities under different temperatures and residue amendments. Growth yields of methanogenic communities in the model were consistent with growth yields observed in other studies, but specific growth rates in the model were somewhat lower. Because the model represents basic microbial behaviour during CH4 transformation, its use will likely improve the confidence with which changes in soil-atmosphere CH4 exchange can be estimated under hypothesized changes in soils, climates and management. However testing of the model should be extended to more complex conditions of transient anaerobiosis under natural temperatures to establish confidence in its predictive capability for soil-atmosphere CH4 exchange.",,"anaerobic fermentation; breathing; environmental monitoring; hydrogen; mathematical model; methane; methanogenesis; microbial growth; simulation; soil; stoichiometry; mathematical model; methanogenesis; modelling; soil/atmosphere flux",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031833967

The importance of the carbon results from its direct association with the gold grade. The studies reported here were directed at resolving the nature and origin of carbon. Techniques used include stope-scale (macroscopic) mapping, mesoscopic (hand specimen) examination, and microscopic studies incorporating the use of optical reflectance measurement. Macroscopic mapping has demonstrated the braided habit of carbon bodies over tens of square metres, with a close parallel to sedimentology. Mesoscopic observations, however, show the vein-like carbon seams are often cross-cutting sedimentary features, with the carbon occupying an anastomosing set of bed-parallel fractures. Microscopic observations show a globular form for the carbon and inclusions of uraninite particles. In seam carbon the globules are generally modified into elongated 'spindles' oriented perpendicular to bedding. Optical properties are dominated by generally high reflectance and anisotropy with a 'swirling' liquid crystal structure, classifying seam carbon as 'carbonaceous mesophase'. It is this fine mesophase texture that has previously been wrongly attributed to plant (algal) morphology. Highly significantly, the optical anisotropy is bed perpendicular (rather than bed parallel as in normal sedimentary burial) indicating mesophase formation during fracture opening. Both reflectance and bireflectance of the seam mesophase show a range of values at all scales. No stratigraphic or depth trends were apparent, though geographic variation points to localization of the maximum temperature event(s). Given high anisotropies, maximum reflectance values in the 4-8% Ro range and minima in the 1-2% Ro range give arithmetic mean reflectance values of about 4.0% Ro. Kinetic modelling equates these values with short term (50 000 years) temperature events of c. 400°C or burial temperatures off. 280°C. Lower reflectance values of c. 2.0% Ro obtained from the shales suggests thermal detachment of permeable and impermeable beds, a characteristic of pulsed hydrothermal flux. The included uraninite grains influence the orientation of the surrounding anisotropic mesophase demonstrating that uraninite predated the mesophase formation event. Regional palaeo-stress 'frozen' into the mesophase anisotropy indicates a NW-SE deviatoric stress. The combination of hydrocarbon, radiation and hydrothermal fluid flow marks Witwatersrand Basin pyrobitumens out as being different from conventional oil. Putative source rocks for the oil are identified in the intra-basinal Witwatersrand shale units. Lithological control in carbon seams is explained by the poro-perm and mechanical properties of the unconformity sequence of footwall, reef conglomerates and hanging wall quartzites favouring fracture along the unconformity surfaces. An overpressured oxidizing fluid created the fracture network that hosted the oil and also introduced uranium as uranyl ion. On meeting a reducing agent (oil), uraninite precipitated stabilizing the oil by polymerization. Further hotter hydrothermal flux then 'coked' the bitumen to often fibrous (spindle-shaped) mesophase. Continued flow deposited gold in the available pore spaces, most notably those formed by lateral contraction between mesophase spindles. The speculative role of methane in the reductive precipitation of gold is indicated by the presence of gold in any co-eval porosity largely independent of the mineral matrix.","Carbon; Gold; Reflectance; Uraninite; Witwatersrand","Archaean; carbon; gold; mineralization; reflectance; uraninite; South Africa, Transvaal, Witwatersrand Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031913969

These are the main drivers for the development of advanced fuel cell technology, which, in turn, relies upon compact and efficient onboard fuel processing to enable a commercially viable use of the technology in cars. Current trends indicate that these new technologies will reach the market in the next decade. Success in all three clean-energy technologies, catalytic converters, PEM fuel cells and onboard fuel processors, has been and continues to be dependent on advances in catalysis.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001225538

The Biolog8 system was used to construct sole carbon source utilisation profiles of these communities. Canonical variate analysis (CVA) was used to analyse the colour production (OD590) data and to discriminate treatment effects. CVA did not differentiate between microbial communities from the two different soil types. It did, however, produce significant clustering of microbial communities from the different plant species. There was clear discrimination between the carbon sources utilised by microbial communities from the different plant rhizospheres. Carbohydrates, carboxylic acids and amino acids were the substrates mainly responsible for this discrimination suggesting plants may differ in the exudation of these compounds. Isolation and enumeration of culturable organisms from these soils confirmed the stimulatory effect of the rhizosphere on microbial growth and in particular pseudomonad proliferation. The number of pseudomonads, but not total bacterial numbers, present in the samples and inoculated into the Biolog plate was significantly correlated (r2 = 0.63, P &lt; 0.01) to colour formation in the wells, indicating that the Biolog system may reflect Pseudomonas carbon utilisation preferences.

We hypothesized that microbial communities from the rhizosphere of Danthonia richardsonii, a native C3 Australian grass, growing at ambient and twice ambient CO2 and varying rates of low N application (20, 60, 180 kg N ha-1) will be different as a consequence of qualitative and quantitative change in rhizosphere carbon flow. We used the Biolog(TM) system to construct sole carbon source utilisation profiles of these communities from the rhizosphere of D. richardsonii. Biolog(TM) GN and MT plates, the latter to which more ecologically relevant root exudate carbon sources were added, were used to characterise the communities. Microbial communities from the rhizosphere of D. richardsonii grown for four years at twice ambient CO2 had significantly greater utilisation of all carbon sources except those with a low C:N ratio (neutral and acidic amino acids, amides, N-heterocycles, long chain aliphatic acids) than communities from plants grown at ambient CO2. This indicates a change in microbial community composition suggesting that under elevated CO2 compounds with a higher C:N ratio were exuded. Enumeration of microorganisms, using plate counts, indicated that there was a preferential stimulation of fungal growth at elevated CO2 and confirmed that bacterial metabolic activity (C utilisation rates), not population size (counts), were stimulated by additional C flow at elevated CO2. Nitrogen was an additional rate-limiting factor for microbial growth in soil and had a significant impact on the microbial response to elevated CO2. Microbial populations were higher in the rhizosphere of plants receiving the highest N application, but the communities receiving the lowest N application were most active. These results have important implications for carbon turnover and storage in soils where changes in soil microbial community structure and stimulation of the activity of microorganisms which prefer to grow on rhizodeposits may lead to a decrease in the composition of organic matter and result in an accumulation of soil carbon.",,"carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon flux; microbial community; nutrient limitation; soil microorganism; Danthonia richardsonii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031767262

Inspection and Maintenance programs (I/M), first introduced in the Clean Air Act of 1963, have evolved into a core component of national air quality policy aimed at reducing mobile source emissions. I/M programs typically require that all passenger vehicles (cars and light trucks) undergo periodic testing to determine whether their emission-control systems are performing acceptably. Traditional I/M programs involve inspections either annually or biennially, with inspection protocols that can range from relatively simple and inexpensive tailpipe testing to more complex and expensive dynamometer testing. But ample data now demonstrate the ineffectiveness of traditional I/M programs for insuring that vehicle emission systems are kept in good working order. This study examines the failings of traditional I/M programs, and recommends improving I/M programs by: creating a clean-screen based on remote sensing or other appropriate technology; sharpening the focus on extreme emitters with remote-sensing; dealing with the equity ramifications of targeting extreme emitters without imposing intolerable financial burdens upon people of limited means; allowing the use of the most appropriate inspection technology in each non-attainment area, according to the nature of the emission problem in that area, the nature and composition of the vehicle fleet, local infrastructure, and economic conditions; and allowing the use of any certified retrofit equipment that brings a vehicle into compliance with emission standards.",,"Smog check; Vehicle emission systems; Inspection; Maintenance; Public policy; Regulatory compliance; Vehicles; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032281168

Experimental manipulation of saturation state clearly demonstrated that substantial calcite undersaturation, in a range typical of organic-rich surface sediment (Ω(calcite) = IMP/K'(sp) = ~0.4), not only resulted in dissolution of abandoned tests but also increased mortality of the live benthic foraminfera Elphidium clavatum (exclavatum) threefold relative to controls.

In this approach, an initial picture of states (local minima of the potential energy of the polymer + penetrant system) and ""macrostates"" (i.e., collections of states communicating over barriers small relative to kBT) is obtained through geometric analysis of accessible volume in representative glassy polymer configurations. Saddle points of the potential energy are computed using the ""necks"" between accessible volume clusters as initial guesses and progressively augmenting the set of degrees of freedom with respect to which the saddle point is calculated. Starting from the saddle points, states and reaction paths are then mapped out in the multidimensional space of penetrant and polymer degrees of freedom, using Fukui's intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) approach, cast in a subset of flexible generalized coordinates. Finally, rate constants for the interstate transitions are computed by multidimensional TST, after invoking a harmonic approximation. Application of this approach to methane at low concentration in glassy atactic polypropylene at 233 K gives well-converged reaction paths involving ca. 350 degrees of freedom of the polymer and confirms the macrostate hypothesis. The rate constant distribution for intermacrostate jumps is found to be very broad, ranging between 10-12 and 106 μs-1. The jump length distribution for jumps between states belonging to different macrostates is fairly narrow and centered about 5 A, which is comparable to the range of motion of the penetrant within a macrostate. Energy barriers for intermacrostate jumps exhibit a broad, asymmetric distribution with mean around 5 kcal/mol, while entropy barriers are much more narrowly and symmetrically distributed with mean around -4kB The detailed information on elementary jumps gathered by these atomistic TST calculations can form the basis for a coarse-grained model of diffusion and for estimating the diffusivity.",,"Approximation theory; Diffusion; Geometry; Mathematical models; Methane; Potential energy; Rate constants; Elementary jumps; Fukui intrinsic reaction coordinate approach; Molecular modeling; Multidimensional transition state theory; Polypropylenes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032491113

During heavy rainfalls, feedlots built on clay-rich soils often become muddy as their soils lose strength. These soils cannot support the weight of animals or equipment. As a result, the animals' rate of gain suffers, and feedlot management becomes difficult. Fluidized Bed Combustor (FBC) ash from the Iowa State University Physical Plant was used to produce a significant increase in soil strength on a cattle feedlot near Nevada, Iowa. FBC ash is the residue from burning high-sulfur coal in fluidized bed combustors. Limestone (calcium carbonate) enters the combustor with the coal as a sorbent to reduce sulfur dioxide emissions. FBC ash is considered a 'nuisance' waste, and the cost for disposal exceeds US$20 per metric ton. Stabilizing cattle feedlot soil with FBC ash represents a recovery of resources because the ash, when combined with clay soil and water, has cementious properties. Research was conducted with three objectives: (1) to determine whether FBC ash can be used to increase the strength of feedlot soil when applied at a level of quality control attainable by using ordinary agricultural tillage equipment; (2) to compare feedlot soil stabilized with FBC ash to non-stabilized feedlot soil in both laboratory and field tests; and (3) to develop a low-cost alternative to paving a feedlot with concrete.

This review presents a framework to assess soil erosion and deposition processes on the distribution and loss of C in soils. The physical processes of erosion and deposition affect soil C distribution in two main ways and should be considered when evaluating the impact of agriculture on C storage. First, these processes redistribute considerable amounts of soil C, within a toposequence or a field, or to a distant site. Accurate estimates of soil redistribution in the landscape or field are needed to quantify the relative magnitude of soil lost by erosion and accumulated by deposition. Secondly, erosion and deposition drastically alter the biological process of C mineralization in soil landscapes. Whereas erosion and deposition only redistribute soil and organic C, mineralization results in a net loss of C from the soil system to the atmosphere. Little is known about the magnitude of organic C losses by mineralization and those due to erosion, but the limited data available suggest that mineralization predominates in the first years after the initial cultivation of the soil, and that erosion becomes a major factor in later years. Soils in depositional sites usually contain a larger proportion of the total organic C in labile fractions of soil C because this material can be easily transported. If the accumulation of soil in depositional areas is extensive, the net result of the burial (and subsequent reduction in decomposition) of this active soil organic matter would be increased C storage. Soil erosion is the most widespread form of soil degradation. At regional or global levels its greatest impact on C storage may be in affecting soil productivity. Erosion usually results in decreased primary productivity, which in turn adversely affects C storage in soil because of the reduced quantity of organic C returned to the soil as plant residues. Thus the use of management practices that prevent or reduce soil erosion may be the best strategy to maintain, or possibly increase, the worlds soil C storage.","Deposition; Erosion; Mineralization; Productivity; Soil carbon","carbon sequestration; deposition; erosion; mineralization; soil emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032490665

As a result, air pollution control strategies for Porto Alegre, where vehicles account for ca. 99% and ca. 86% of total city wide CO and hydrocarbons emissions, respectively, must make use of air quality data specific to the Porto Alegre area. In this study, ambient concentrations of 66 C2-C10 hydrocarbons have been measured for ca. 1 year (March 1996-April 1997) at downtown Porto Alegre locations. On the average, the 10 most abundant hydrocarbons on a mass concentration basis were, in decreasing order, as follows: acetylene, ethylene, propane, toluene, isopentane, (m+p)xylene, propene, n-butane, benzene, and n-pentane. Scatterplots of ambient concentrations showed a high degree of correlation among hydrocarbon classes (e.g., alkenes, isobutene vs 1-pentene), between hydrocarbons (alkanes, alkenes, and aromatics) and acetylene, and between hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. Mid-1996 hydrocarbon emission rates (e.g., 3274 ± 828 and 1419 ± 369 t per year for acetylene and isopentane, respectively) are estimated from regression analysis of ambient hydrocarbon vs ambient CO. Reactivity rankings are presented, one involving reaction with OH (using hydrocarbon-OH reaction rate constants) and the other involving the production of ozone (using maximum incremental reactivity coefficients). Production of ozone is dominated by the following alkenes and aromatics (in order of decreasing importance): ethylene, (m+p)- xylene (calculated for m-xylene), propene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, toluene, trans-2-pentene, 2-methyl-2-butene, isobutene, p-ethyltoluene, and o-xylene. Reaction with OH is dominated by these nine alkenes (in order of decreasing importance): ethylene, 2-methyl-2-butene, propene, isobutene, trans-2- pentene, 2-methyl-1-butene, cyclopentene, trans-2-butene, and 1,3-butadiene. If carbon monoxide, ethanol, and MTBE are included along with the 66 hydrocarbons, the reactivity rankings indicate a major role for CO (ranked second after ethylene for ozone formation and ranked first for reaction with OH), a modest role for ethanol (ranked 16 for ozone formation and 18 for reaction with OH) and a minor role for MTBE (ranked 30 for ozone formation and 28 for reaction with OH).The ambient concentrations of 55 hydrocarbons in Porto Alegre from March 20, 1996 to April 16, 1997 were measured. The comprehensive data set obtained was discussed in terms of the contribution of vehicle exhaust emissions, hydrocarbon emission rates are estimated, and the hydrocarbons are ranked according to their photochemical reactivity.

Meltwater provided by this snow cover can be an important source of freshwater for agriculture, domestic uses and hydroelectric power. Rapid ablation of the snowpack, however, can also pose environmental hazards such as flooding. The ability to forecast meltwater quantities is dependent upon a knowledge of the factors influencing the snowmelt process. This paper employs a hybrid modelling and synoptic climatological approach to investigate the relationships between synoptic weather patterns, surface energy fluxes and midwinter snowmelt in the northern Great Plains. The first objective of this study is to identify distinct synoptic patterns that are associated with days where significant snow cover ablation occurred. The second objective is to evaluate the relationships between synoptic-scale weather patterns, snow surface energy transfers and snowmelt. A case study of 21 February 1975 is used to illustrate these relationships. Unlike the other synoptic-type studies, which rely on empirically derived energy flux data from single index sites, this study employs a physically based snowpack model to generate estimates of energy fluxes. The use of modelled fluxes instead of measured values allows for a more spatially extensive analysis as surface fluxes over the entire study region can be analysed in conjunction with the prevailing synoptic-scale weather patterns. Three major synoptic types, characterized by the presence of a midlatitude cyclone, are associated with large midwinter snowmelt episodes in the northern Great Plains. The case study illustrates how variations in temperature, humidity, cloud cover and wind speeds associated with such cyclonic storms can play a major role in affecting snow surface-atmosphere energy exchanges. As expected, elevated wind speeds and stronger temperature and humidity gradients significantly increased the transfers of sensible and latent heat between the snow surface and the atmosphere. Increased cloud cover near the low pressure centre reduced incoming solar radiation but through counter radiation also reduced the loss of long-wave radiation.A hybrid modeling and synoptic climatological approach was employed to study the relationships between synoptic weather patterns, surface energy fluxes and midwinter snowmelt in the northern Great Plains.

A portfolio of these methods is required to achieve the large reductions required; of which utilization of carbon sinks (i.e. material, geosphere and biosphere) will be an important player. Material sinks will probably only play a minor role as compared to biosphere and geosphere sinks in storage of CO2. Biosphere sinks are attractive because they can sequester CO2 from a diffuse source whereas geosphere sinks require a pure waste stream of CO2 (obtained by using expensive separation methods). On the other hand, environmental factors and storage time favor geosphere sinks. It is expected that a combination of the two will be used in order to meet emission reduction targets over the next 100 yr. A critical look is taken at capacities, retention/residence times, rates of uptake and relative cost of utilization of biosphere and geosphere sinks at three scales - global, national (Canada) and provincial (Alberta). Biosphere sinks considered are oceans, forests and soils. Geosphere sinks considered are enhanced oil recovery, coal beds, depleted oil and gas reservoirs and deep aquifers. The largest sinks are oceans and deep aquifers. The other biosphere and geosphere sinks have total capacities approximately of an order of lower magnitude. The sinks that will probably be used first are those that are economically viable such as enhanced oil-recovery, agriculture, forestry and possibly enhanced coalbed methane-recovery. The other sinks will be used when these options have been exhausted or are not available or a penalty (e.g. carbon tax) exists. Although the data tabulated for these sinks is only regarded as preliminary, it provides a starting point for assessment of the role of large sinks in meeting greenhouse gas emission reduction targets.",,"carbon dioxide; carbon sink; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; Alberta; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032447823

New technology under development, such as integrated gasification and combined cycle technology (IGCC), and reduced biomass costs would improve the competitiveness of bioenergy systems. The CO2 mitigation costs are lower for biomass systems using IGCC technology than for natural gas systems using decarbonization. Considering the temporary reduced greenhouse gases from the soil when short-rotation forest (Salix) replaces annual food crops on mineral soils, the cO2 mitigation costs could be reduced further by about 10% for bioenergy systems. The cost of Salix can be reduced in the future by about 30% because of improvements in plant breeding and cultivation methods, and even more if Salix plantations are used for the treatment of municipal waste water. This would further improve the competitiveness of bioenergy systems. Several data used in the cost calculations are uncertain, especially regarding new technologies such as IGCC, decarbonization, and waste water treatment in Salix plantations, and will vary with local conditions.

Echoing the uneasy and complex dialectic between nature and capital in the American West, organic farming is becoming more akin to farming off nature's image, as the idiom of a 'purer' nature is deployed to sell what is increasingly commodified nature. The direction of organic agriculture in California can be understood as reflecting global trends in agro-food provision and regulation, but it is also uniquely grounded in the context of California's regional history: on the one hand, a product of the counterculture, bolstered by a strong climate of environmental regulation; on the other hand, a legacy of California's exceptional agriculture, characterized in part by the dominance of growers' organizations and a focus on high-value specialty crops. This paper also discusses three ways in which the political construction of the meaning of 'organic' and its institutionalization in regulatory agencies such as private certification organizations have facilitated both the proliferation of agribusiness entrants and their adoption of questionably sustainable practices: first, certification agencies have their own institutional logic and are most beholden to their client-growers; second, regulation requires the definition of enforceable standards out of complicated ecological, economic, and even sociocultural concerns; third, the certification process, by conferring a legal right to market food as organic, has created distinct incentives that shape participation in the sector.",,"agribusiness; agricultural practice; agricultural regulation; agro-food trends; organic certification; organic farming; resources management; California; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031850382

The cooling events during the early- and mid-Holocene represent temperature values similar to today, and apparently the onset of cooling events represents a deviation from today's mean annual temperature of about 1°C and is triggered at a 1000-year periodicity. At Wallisellen-Langachermoos (440 m), a former oligotrophic lake near Zurich, the correlation between summertime lake levels and the seed production of the amphi-Atlantic aquatic plant Najas flexilis was used to reconstruct lake levels over a 3000-year period during the first part of the Holocene. At Lake Seedorf on the western Swiss Plateau (609 m) the sedimentological, palynological and macrofossil record revealed fluctuations of lake levels for the complete Holocene. From Lago Basso in the southern Alps (2250 m, Val San Giacomo near Splugen Pass, Northern Italy) the terrestrial plant macrofossils - especially Pinus cembra and Larix allowed the reconstruction of timberline fluctuations controlled by climate. A similar climatic pattern was found at Gouille Rion pond in the central Swiss Alps (2343 m, Val d'Heremence) with plant macrofossils and pollen concentrations and percentages. We postulate that these climatic events are detectable throughout central Europe by independent methods in combination with precise AMS-radiocarbon datings on terrestrial plant remains. Our data fit other proxy records of regional climatic change, such as cool intervals from Greenland ice cores, glacier movements in the Swiss and Austrian Alps, and dendro-densitometry on subfossil wood, as well as the palaeoclimatic data from the Jura Mountains of France obtained by sedimentological analyses. Thus our data indicate that the Northern Hemisphere climate was less stable during the Holocene than previously believed.","Central Europe; Holocene; Hydrophytes; Najas flexilis; Palaeoclimate; Plant macrofossils; Switzerland; Timberline","Holocene; paleoclimate; timber trade; Alps; Switzerland; Larix; Najas flexilis; Pinus cembra; Roman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031838714

The interest has expanded to include ecologically significant groups and major biomass producers using mesocosm studies, emphasizing species interactions. This paper assesses the effects of UV-B radiation on dissolved organic matter, decomposers, primary and secondary producers, and briefly summarizes recent studies in freshwater and marine systems. Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and particulate organic carbon (POC) are degradation products of living organisms. These substances are of importance in the cycling of carbon in aquatic ecosystems. UV-B radiation has been found to break down high-molecular-weight substances and make them available to bacterial degradation. In addition, DOC is responsible for short-wavelength absorption in the water column. Especially in coastal areas and freshwater ecosystems, penetration of solar radiation is limited by high concentrations of dissolved and particulate matter. On the other hand, climate warming and acidification result in faster degradation of these substances and thus enhance the penetration of UV radiation into the water column. Several research groups have investigated light penetration into the water column. Past studies on UV penetration into the water column were based on temporally and spatially scattered measurements. The process of spectral attenuation of radiant energy in natural waters is well understood and straightforward to model. Less known is the spatial and temporal variability of in-water optical properties influencing UV attenuation and there are few long-term observations. In Europe, this deficiency of measurements is being corrected by a project involving the development of a monitoring system (ELDONET) for solar radiation using three-channel dosimeters (UV-A, UV-B, PAR) that are being installed from Abisko (North Sweden, 68°N, 19°E) to Tenerife (Canary Islands, 27°N, 17°W). Some of the instruments have been installed in the water column (North Sea, Baltic Sea, Kattegat, East and Western Mediterranean, North Atlantic), establishing the first network of underwater dosimeters for continuous monitoring. Bacteria play a vital role in mineralization of organic matter and provide a trophic link to higher organisms. New techniques have substantially changed our perception of the role of bacteria in aquatic ecosystems over the recent past and bacterioplankton productivity is far greater than previously thought, having high division and turnover rates. It has been shown that bacterioplankton play a central role in the carbon flux in aquatic ecosystems by taking up DOC and remineralizing the carbon. Bacterioplankton are more prone to UV-B stress than larger eukaryotic organisms and, based on one study, produce about double the amount of cyclobutane dimers. Recently, the mechanism of nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria has been shown to be affected by UV-B stress. Wetlands constitute important ecosystems both in the tropics and at temperate latitudes. In these areas, cyanobacteria form major constituents in microbial mats. The organisms optimize their position in the community by vertical migration in the mat, which is controlled by both visible and UV-B radiation. Cyanobacteria are also important in tropical and sub-tropical rice paddy fields, where they contribute significantly to the availability of nitrogen. Solar UV radiation affects growth, development and several physiological responses of these organisms. On a global basis, phytoplankton are the most important biomass producers in aquatic ecosystems. The organisms populate the top layers of the oceans and freshwater habitats where they receive sufficient solar radiation for photosynthetic processes. New research strengthens previous evidence that solar UV affects growth and reproduction, photosynthetic energy-harvesting enzymes and other cellular proteins, as well as photosynthetic pigment contents. The uptake of ammonium and nitrate is affected by solar radiation in phytoplankton, as well as in macroalgae. Damage to phytoplankton at the molecular, cellular, population and community levels has been demonstrated. In contrast, at the ecosystem level there are few convincing data with respect to the effects of ozone-related UV-B increases and considerable uncertainty remains. Following UV-B irradiation, shifts in phytoplankton community structure have been demonstrated, which may have consequences for the food web. Macroalgae and seagrasses are important biomass producers in aquatic ecosystems (but considerably smaller than phytoplankton). In contrast to phytoplankton, most of these organisms are sessile and can thus not avoid exposure to solar radiation at their growth site. Recent investigations showed a pronounced sensitivity to solar UV-B radiation, and effects have been found throughout the top 10-15 m of the water column. Photoinhibition can be quantified by oxygen exchange or by PAM (pulse amplitude modulated) fluorescence. Surface-adapted macroalgae, such as several brown and green algae, show a maximum of oxygen production at or close to the surface; whereas algae adapted to lower irradiances usually thrive best when exposed deeper in the water column. Mechanisms of protection and repair are being investigated. UV effects on aquatic animals are of increased interest. Evidence for UV effects has been demonstrated in zooplankton activity. Other UV-B-sensitive aquatic organisms include sea urchins, corals and amphibians. Solar UV radiation has been known to affect corals directly. In addition, photosynthesis in their symbiotic algae is impaired, resulting in reduced organic carbon supply.","Aquatic ecosystems; Bakterioplankton; Dissolved organic carbon; Macroalgae; Phytoplankton; Seagrass; Ultraviolet-B radiation; Zooplankton","ammonia; carbon; carbon dioxide; fresh water; nitrate; nitrogen; absorption; alga; Amphibia; article; benthos; biomass; coral; Cyanobacterium; dosimetry; ecology; ecosystem; fish; nitrogen fixation; nonhuman; particulate matter; photosynthesis; phytoplankton; priority journal; radiation attenuation; ultraviolet B radiation; zooplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344527958

Despite stoichiometric excess of reductant hydrocarbon below this limit, the in situ formed NO2 does not react with C3H8, thus conversion of NO to N2 is negligible. NO can be reduced by C3H8selectively to N2 only when C3H8/NO ≥ 1. Contrary to many suggestions the reaction temperature, concentration of oxygen, space velocity, and type of exchange ions have minor influence on the selectivity for N2. These parameters affect the rates of reactions (NO + O2), (C3H8 + NOx) and (C3H8 + O2), therefore they also affect the production of N2 in the HC-SCR process, but only when the ratio of C3H8/NO permits. The metal-exchanged zeolites were prepared in situ by solid-state ion exchange from H-ZSM5. Despite the low degree of copper exchange (63%), Cu,H-ZSM5 produces substantially more N2 than H-ZSM5, Ag,H-ZSM5, or Li,H-ZSM5. However, the selectivity for N2 is lowest over Cu,H-ZSM5, which also produces considerable NO2 in the reaction of (NO + C3H8 + O2) even at C3H8/NO ≥ 1. Contrary to prior findings, the catalytic activity of Cu,H-ZSM5 for the oxidation of NO by O2 to NO2 in absence of hydrocarbon was comparable to that of H-ZSM5 at high space velocities (2.31g-1 min-1). By replacing 30 and 40% of the protons of H-ZSM5 by Ag+ and Li+ ions in Ag,H-ZSM5 and Li,H-ZSM5, respectively, the catalytic activity for this reaction becomes negligible at temperatures ≥100 °C.

We have examined connections between nutrients, and the expression and activity of Cln3-Cdc28 kinase that regulates the G1-S boundary of the cell cycle in yeast, a point referred to as Start. We find that Cln3 protein levels are highest in glucose and lower in poorer carbon sources. This regulation involves both transcriptional and post-transcriptional control. Although the Ras-cAMP pathway does not appear to affect CLN3 transcription, cAMP increases Cln3 protein levels and Cln3-Cdc28 kinase activity. This regulation requires untranslated regions of the CLN3 message, and can be explained by changes in protein synthesis rates caused by cAMP.

Important studies of salinity-controlled environments include those of the Bathonian of Scotland, the Kimmeridgian of Portugal and the Bajocian-Callovian of Tunisia, and the use of carbon isotopes as a tool in relation to palaeoecology is discussed. Determination of depth of sea is important for basin analysis but remains a difficult challenge. Significant advances can however be made using a variety of criteria. Among other factors, varying substrates and incidence of light are also amenable to palaeoecological analysis.","Jurassic; Oxygenation; Palaeobathymetry; Palaeoecology; Salinity; Temperature","Jurassic; oxygenation; paleoenvironment; paleotemperature; salinity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032469787

In addition, all buildable urban residential land is expected to be developed by 2010. The region is now grappling with possible solutions to these problems. An excellent regional indicator of both the efficiency of land use arrangements and vehicle emissions is the number of vehicle trips. From an air quality perspective, measures to reduce vehicle miles traveled (e.g., carpooling, commuter rail, and telecommuting) that fail to reduce the number of vehicle trips have little effect on air quality. Only by lowering vehicle ownership rates - i.e., increasing opportunities for a car-free lifestyle - can vehicle emissions be reduced in the long term. Land use and transportation reforms advocated by the San Diego Association of Governments and the Air Pollution Control District could reduce future vehicle trips 5-15%.

The experiments were performed in a 150 kW, pilot-scale test furnace under practical operating conditions and temperatures, so as to be applicable to real systems. Most of the tests were conducted with gas oil, and fuel-N and fuel-S were simulated by quinoline and tetrahydrothiophene (thiophane) respectively. Although this does not exactly replicate the complex compounds of the types found in heavier liquid and solid fuels, it allows for controlled tests to be undertaken while retaining the characteristics of a turbulent-diffusion flame. The NO emissions in the exhaust gas were affected by the addition of sulphur to the fuel, to an extent dependent on the fuel sulphur:nitrogen ratio and mixing conditions in the near-burner region. The magnitude of the effects was greatest for fuel-rich conditions - for example when the flame was staged. Thermal-NO emissions were reduced with sulphur addition for fuel-lean operation of the primary stage, but were unaffected when the furnace was operated fuel-rich. These effects are substantiated by in-flame concentration measurements of NO and the important NOx precursors, ammonia and cyanide, which are presented together with data from comparative studies using SO2 as the sulphur additive. The in-flame measurements of ammonia and cyanide showed that where increases in fuel-NO were observed due to the effects of sulphur, there were corresponding reductions in ammonia and cyanide. Kinetic studies on a representative flame system made by means of a PSR approach through CHEMKIN and KINALC showed qualitative agreement with the experimental trends, and demonstrate the main pathways for sulphur-nitrogen interactions. A practical implication of these results for NOx modellers is to raise the need for greater awareness of the role of chemistry, particularly in low-NOx burner applications, since the sulphur appears to be reducing the efficiency of the NO reduction processes in the locally fuel-rich regions of the flame.",,"Ammonia; Computer simulation; Cyanides; Exhaust gases; Flame research; Fuel burners; Gas emissions; Nitrogen; Nitrogen oxides; Reaction kinetics; Sulfur; Quinoline; Solid fuels; Tetrahydrothiophene; Turbulent diffusion flames; Fossil fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032154553

The engine was equipped with a common rail, electronically-controlled, high-pressure fuel injection system that is capable of up to four injection pulses per engine cycle. The engine was instrumented with an endoscope system for optical access for the combustion visualization. Multidimensional combustion and soot modeling results were used for comparisons to enhance the understanding and interpretation of the experimental data. Good agreement between computed and measured cylinder pressures, heat release and soot and NOx emissions was achieved. In addition, good qualitative agreement was found between in-cylinder soot concentration (KL) and temperature fields obtained from the endoscope images and those obtained from the multidimensional modeling. The imaging results were used in conjunction with modeling to explain why split injections are beneficial to reduce soot emissions and also why they may under retarded timing conditions increase soot emissions leading to the experimentally observed ""soot catastrophe."" The reason for the dramatically increased soot at retarded timings is shown in the images to be due to poor ignition and combustion of the late injected fuel pulses in multiple injection schemes. The present modeling results also suggest a feedback mechanism where high in-cylinder soot levels can lead to high radiative heat transfer which promotes fuel vaporization. This, in turn, results in more locally fuel rich combustion which enhances the formation of soot.

However, considerable difficulty is encountered in the vertebral region due to the complexity of structures and the fact that other benign lesions, especially degenerative changes, are very common there. Single-photon emission tomography (SPET) has been reported to be useful in the differentiation of benign from malignant conditions. Here we report our experience with bone SPET in the diagnosis of vertebral metastases. This is a retrospective study of technetium-99m methylene diphosphonate (MDP) bone scans in 174 consecutive patients who were referred for the investigation of back pain in our department. MDP planar and SPET images were obtained. Of teh 174 patients, 98 had a known history of malignant tumours. The diagnosis of vertebral metastasis was made on the basis of the patients' clinical histories and the findings with other imaging techniques such as magnetic resonance imaging, computed tomography or follow-up bone scan. We found that the presence of pedicle involvement as seen on SPET was an accurate diagnostic criterion of vertebral metastasis. SPET had a sensitivity of 87%, a specificity of 91%, a positive predictive value of 82%, a negative predictive value of 94% and an accuracy of 90%. On the other hand, planar study had a sensitivity of 74%, a specificity of 81%, a positive predictive value of 64%, a negative predictive value of 88% and an accuracy of 79% in diagnosing vertebral metastasis. Except with regard to the negative predictive value, SPET performed statistically better than planar imaging. Only 9/147 (6.4%) lesions involving the vertebral body alone and 3/49 (6.1%) lesions involving facet joints alone were subsequently found to be metastases. We conclude that bone SPET is an accurate diagnostic test for the detection of vertebral metastases and is superior to planar imaging in this respect.","Bone scan; Planar imaging; Single-photon emission tomography; Vertebral metastases","medronate technetium tc 99m; adult; aged; article; backache; bone scintiscanning; clinical trial; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic test; diagnostic value; differential diagnosis; female; human; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; retrospective study; single photon emission computer tomography; spine metastasis; Aged; Female; Humans; Low Back Pain; Lumbar Vertebrae; Male; Predictive Value of Tests; Radiopharmaceuticals; Retrospective Studies; Sensitivity and Specificity; Spinal Neoplasms; Technetium Tc 99m Medronate; Thoracic Vertebrae; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031833855

Box 10015, 3505 AA Utrecht, Netherlands","The production and use of biomass for energy has both positive and negative impacts on the environment. The environmental impacts of energy crops should be clarified before political choices concerning energy crops are made. An important aid to policy-making would be a systematic methodology to assess the environmental sustainability of energy crops. So far, most studies on the environmental aspects of energy crops deal mainly with the energy production of the crops and the possible consequences for CO2 mitigation. The Dutch Centre for Agriculture and Environment (CLM) has developed a systematic methodology to assess the ecological and socio-economic sustainability of biomass crops. The method is best described as a multicriteria analysis of process chains and is very much related to Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). Characteristics of our methodology are the use of: definition of functional units; analysis of the entire lifecycle; definition of yield levels and corresponding agricultural practices; analysis of both ecological and economic criteria; definition of reference systems; definition of procedures for normalisation and weighing. CLM has applied the method to assess the sustainability of ten potentially interesting energy crops in four European regions. The results are used to outline the perspectives for large scale production of biomass crops with regard to the medium and long term land availability in Europe. For the crops considered, net energy budget ranges from 85 GJ net avoided fossil energy per ha for rape seed for fuel to 248 GJ net avoided fossil energy per ha for silage maize for electricity from gasification. The methodology of the tool and its results were discussed at the concerted action 'Environmental aspects of biomass production and routes for European energy supply' (AIR3-94-2455), organised by CLM in 1996. Major conclusions of the research: Multicriteria analysis of process lifecycles is at present the best available option to assess the ecological and economical sustainability of energy crops. However, it is recognised that further research and development activities in the field of LCA are necessary. Use of crops for generation of electricity is preferred to use of crops for transport fuels since the latter score love on both ecological and socio-economical criteria. Large scale use and production of energy crops requires (a) choices and goals from agricultural, environmental, and energy policies, and (b) policy instruments for financial incentives e.g. with payments or with tax rebates, preferably per kilogram avoided CO2 emission.The Dutch Center for Agriculture and Environment (CLM) developed a systematic methodology to assess the ecological and socio-economic sustainability of biomass crops.

This paper makes the case that an upstream system would be a cost-effective, fair, and feasible approach to domestic carbon regulation, and describes how an upstream system could be designed and administered. An upstream system offers several advantages over the downstream approach including: 1) comprehensive coverage - virtually all fossil fuel use and carbon emissions in the U.S. economy would be captured; and 2) administrative feasibility - involving fewer industries and regulated entities. Realizing these benefits would depend on determining the proper point in the production cycle of each fuel to require allowances. This paper concludes that allowances should be required at petroleum refineries, natural gas pipelines, natural gas processing plants and coal preparation plants.",,"Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Public policy; Regulatory compliance; Carbon emissions; United States; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032268962

This burial is intrinsically linked to the cycling of biogeochemically important elements (such as N, P, S, Fe and Mn) and, on geological timescales, largely controls the oxygen content of the atmosphere. Currently there is a volatile debate over which processes govern sedimentary organic carbon preservation. In spite of numerous studies demonstrating empirical relationships between organic carbon burial and such factors as primary productivity, the flux of organic carbon through the water column, sedimentation rate, organic carbon degradation rate, and bottom- water oxygen concentration, the mechanisms directly controlling sedimentary organic carbon preservation remain unclear. Furthermore, as organic carbon burial is the process that, along with pyrite burial, balances O2 concentrations in the atmosphere, it is desirable that any mechanism proposed to control organic carbon preservation include a feedback buffering atmospheric oxygen concentrations over geological time. Here we compare analyses of sediments underlying two regions of the eastern North Pacific Ocean, one which has oxygen-depleted bottom waters and one with typical oxygen distributions. Organic carbon burial efficiency is strongly correlated with the length of time accumulating particles are exposed to molecular oxygen in sediment pore waters. Oxygen exposure time effectively incorporates other proposed environmental variables, and may exert a direct control on sedimentary organic carbon preservation and atmospheric oxygen concentrations.",,"oxygen; carbon preservation; continental margin; oxygen exposure time; sediment; article; geology; mexico; priority journal; sediment; total organic carbon; united states; water sampling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032484981

The presence of pollutants in urban air is reported to cause adverse effects on human health, as well as damage to structures and materials. Their presence can also be an aesthetic nuisance around urban centres. Modelling of urban air pollution is an important facet of pollution control and abatement. Models explain the occurrence, intensity, and movement of pollutants. Current techniques used for modelling urban air pollution use dispersion characteristics to predict pollutant levels at locations away from defined sources. They work well in relatively simple situations with few sources in consideration. However, these models cannot handle the mathematics in an airshed with many point and non-point sources of urban air pollutants. This is because many simplifying assumptions have to be made, which limit the accuracy of predictions. Artificial Neural Network (ANN) modelling is a technique that offers many advantages in modelling non-linear type processes such as those that govern complex urban air pollution situations. This technique uses historical data sets and can recognize the patterns that occur between different pollutants the urban airshed. ANN modelling is a `black-box' method, where equations describing the complex situations are not known or required. The model simply extrapolates patterns and `learns' based on historical data, much the same way the human mind learns. Therefore, ANN may be suitable for air pollution modelling of situations where the governing equations are too complex or expensive to derive. This paper describes the use of ANN to predict behavior of oxides of nitrogen (NOx) within a defined region of the City of Edmonton, Alberta.",,"Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Industrial emissions; Neural networks; Nitrogen oxides; Pattern recognition; Urban planning; Black box method; Extrapolation; Urban air pollution; Air pollution control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031650350

The effects change significantly with an increase in calcination temperature of the support. The lattice constant of CeO2-ZrO2 decreases with an increase in calcination temperature. The correlation curve between the lattice constant and calcination temperature as well as that between crystalline growth and calcination temperature has an inflection point at 900°C. Thus, the structure of the CeO2-ZrO2 solid solutions depends on the calcination temperature. In particular, the structure changes significantly at 900°C and calcination at 900°C shows a maximum amount of surface oxygen-deficient sites catalyzing N2O decomposition. Moreover, the reduction extent at 400°C is directly proportional to rhodium concentration per unit surface area in addition to the considerable structure change of CeO2-ZrO2. Hence, the localization and/or aggregation effect of rhodium particles also contributes to the reduction creating surface oxygen vacancy.","Ceria-zirconia; Hydrogen; Reduction; Rhodium",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000823556

A critical question can be stated as a null hypothesis: tree water use per unit leaf area (leaf efficiency) is independent of eucalypt species. This is implicitly equivalent to the hydrological equilibrium hypothesis that states that leaf area is a function of climate, at least in cases where transpiration and growth are limited by soil water. Failure to reject this null hypothesis simplifies (a) the selection of tree species for water balance management, (b) the generation of regional-scale expectations of leaf area index, and (c) the estimation (monitoring) of the effectiveness of plantations in controlling site water balance. The hypothesis was tested with tree water use data collected in natural multi-species stands across Australia, including sites in the wet-dry season tropical woodlands of the Northern Territory, the Mediterranean climate forests of Western Australia, and a woodland system in southern New South Wales receiving an even distribution of rainfall throughout the year. We also tested the hypothesis in a multi-species tree plantation growing on a saline gradient. In each case, we could not reject the hypothesis of constant leaf efficiency among eucalypts. In every case there was a common, strong, linear relationship among tree leaf area and mean daily water use by all tree species in a sample. Single factor (species) analysis of variance did not detect significant differences between leaf water efficiencies of species. For the jarrah forest (Eucalyptus marginata J. Donn ex Sm., E. calophylla R. Br. ex Lindl.), the null hypothesis held in both spring (wet) and autumn (dry) conditions. The null hypothesis held in the mixed species woodland of New South Wales (E. macrorhynca F.J. Muell. ex Benth., E. blakelyi Maiden., E. polyanthemos Schauer.) under summer and autumn conditions, and across five species in the wet-dry tropical woodland (E. miniata A. Cunn. ex Schauer, E. tetrodonta F.J. Muell., E. porecta S.T. Blake, Erythrophleum chlorostachys F.J. Muell., and Terminalia ferdinandiana Exell.). The null hypothesis also held for a plantation of E. occidentalis Endl. and provenances of E. camaldulensis Dehnh. growing on a shallow saline gradient; i.e., leaf water efficiency remained constant across species and varieties despite obvious effects of salinity on the size of individual canopies. We conclude that there is little evidence for rejecting the hypothesis that leaf efficiency does not vary significantly among sympatric eucalypt species in rainfall-limited (soil-water-limited) systems. These findings open the way for useful bioengineering generalities about the hydrological role of trees in the Australian landscape.","Bioengineering; Eucalyptus; Hydrological equilibrium theory; Landscape remediation; Leaf efficiency; Mediterranean climate; Salinity; Tropical forest","climate effect; genotype; leaf; water use; Australia; Corymbia calophylla; Dicotyledoneae; Erythrophleum; Erythrophleum chlorostachys; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus blakelyi; Eucalyptus blakelyi; Eucalyptus calophylla; Eucalyptus camaldulensis; Eucalyptus camaldulensis; Eucalyptus macrorhyncha; Eucalyptus macrorhyncha; Eucalyptus marginata; Eucalyptus miniata; Eucalyptus miniata; Eucalyptus occidentalis; Eucalyptus occidentalis; Eucalyptus polyanthemos; Eucalyptus polyanthemos; Eucalyptus porecta; Eucalyptus porecta; Eucalyptus tetrodonta; Eucalyptus tetrodonta; Terminalia; Terminalia ferdinandiana",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031689640

Possible impacts of climate change and variability on marine life have received some attention, mainly regarding changes in living conditions via changes in water temperature, wind and waves and other physical climate related forcing of the marine environment. There is also a chemical forcing of the marine environment caused by CO2 emissions to the atmosphere penetrating into the oceans. The perturbation of the marine environment through such indirect, i.e. via the atmosphere, storage of CO2 in the oceans may be estimated based on known and predicted atmospheric CO2 levels. Capture of CO2 from the flue gas of power plants and large industries followed by storage directly in the oceans may be a necessary component of a greenhouse gas mitigation strategy for the next century in order to achieve a stabilization of atmospheric CO2 levels. Direct storage of CO2 in the oceans may impose, at least locally, a stronger perturbation of the marine environment than indirect storage via the atmosphere. Storage of waste CO2 in aquifers below the seabed may also affect the marine environment if CO2 leaks out in the water column above. In view of the perturbations of the marine environment that are already ongoing as a consequence of CO2 emissions to the atmosphere and which will accelerate in the business-as-usual scenario as well as in scenarios including realistic CO2 removal options, there is a need to clarify the resilience of marine ecosystems to increased CO2. This paper discusses the large perturbations that are expected in various scenarios. One hypothesis is that direct ocean storage if performed in the most environment-friendly way may be acceptable, while continued emissions to the atmosphere and invasion across the air-sea-interface could lead not only to climate change but could also be harmful to marine food webs and ecosystem functions. Some experimental approaches that may be taken in order to contribute to a wider knowledge base for CO2 policies are briefly described.",,"Greenhouse gases; Ocean storage; Air pollution control; Aquifers; Carbon dioxide; Environmental impact; Greenhouse effect; Ocean dumping; Research and development management; Marine pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; environmental impact; oceanic sink; atmosphere; carbon dioxide fixation; conference paper; environmental impact assessment; gas waste; marine environment; priority journal; sea; waste disposal",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031778854

MOZART is developed in the framework of the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate Model (CCM) and includes a detailed representation of tropospheric chemistry. The model provides the distribution of 56 chemical species at a spatial resolution of 2.8° in both latitude and longitude, with 25 levels in the vertical (from the surface to level of 3 mbar) and a time step of 20 min. The meteorological information is supplied from a 2-year run of the NCAR Community Climate Model. The simulated distributions of ozone (O3) and its precursors are evaluated by comparison with observational data. The distribution of methane, nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), and CO are generally well simulated by the model. The model evaluation in the tropics stresses the need for a better representation of biomass burning emissions in order to evaluate the budget of carbon monoxide, nitrogen species, and ozone with more accuracy in these regions. MOZART reproduces the NO observations in most parts of the troposphere. Nitric acid, however, is overestimated over the Pacific by up to a factor of 10 and over continental regions by a factor of 2-3. Discrepancies are also found in the simulation of PAN in the upper troposphere and in biomass burning regions. These results highlight shortcomings in our understanding of the nitrogen budget in the troposphere. The seasonal cycle of ozone in the troposphere is generally well reproduced by the model in comparison with ozone soundings. MOZART tends, however, to underestimate O3 at higher latitudes, and specifically above 300 mbar. The global photochemical production and destruction of ozone in the troposphere are 3018 Tg/yr and 2511 Tg/yr, respectively (net ozone production of 507 Tg/yr).

To meet Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and State air emission regulations, smelters must remove mercury vapors from hot exhaust gases, usually through the use of scrubbing solutions. Most of the mercury is precipitated out of the waste scrubbing solutions as the sulfide and the sludge dewatered in a filter press. SepraDyne Corporation (Denton, TX, USA) has conducted pilot-scale treatability studies of dewatered acid plant blowdown sludge generated by a copper smelter using its recently patented high temperature and high vacuum indirectly-heated rotary retort technology. This unique rotary kiln is capable of operating at internal temperatures up to 850°C with an internal pressure of 50 torr and eliminates the use of sweep gas to transport volatile substances out of the retort. By removing non-condensables such as oxygen and nitrogen at relatively low temperatures and coupling the process with a temperature ramp-up program and low temperature condensation, virtually all of the retort off-gases produced during processing can be condensed for recovery. The combination of rotation, heat and vacuum produce the ideal environment for the rapid volatilization of virtually all organic compounds, water and low-to-moderate boiling point metals such as arsenic, cadmium and mercury. Atmospheric oxygen can readily be reduced to very low concentrations within the kiln so that combustion does not take place. Initial concentrations of mercury in the waste ranged from 565 to 1260 mg/kg. The waste was processed in a 1.5 cubic foot capacity batch pilot unit at temperatures ranging from 427 to 649°C at a pressure of 76 torr. Total processing time ranged from 1.5 to 4.0 h. The processed material contained total mercury concentrations ranging from 0.065 mg/kg when processed at 649°C to an average of 2.2 mg/kg when processed at 427°C. The vaporized mercury was recovered as elemental mercury in a low temperature condenser. Mercury emissions averaged approximately 6.5 μg/M3, significantly below the Maximum Achievable Control Technology (MACT) standard of 40 μg/M3. Based upon the success of these tests, a contract was let and a commercial scale unit was built. The 2-ton per batch commercial unit was installed at the copper smelter and began operations in late June 1998. As of the end of October, approximately 500 tons of mercury-contaminated acid blowdown sludge had been processed to below the specified treatment criteria of 10 mg/kg total mercury.",,"mercury; air pollution control; chemical waste; concentration (parameters); conference paper; environmental protection; mining; priority journal; volatilization; waste management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032452863

On the hemispheric scale, the importance of evapotranspiration, vegetation surface roughness, and vegetation albedo in the current generation of atmospheric general circulation models is reviewed. Finally, I assess at the planetary scale the global climate effects of biogenic emissions that are well mixed throughout the troposphere. I show that daily maximum and minimum temperatures are, in part, controlled by the emission of non-methane hydrocarbons and transpired water vapour. In many regions, a substantial fraction of the rainfall arises from upstream evapotranspiration rather than from oceanic evaporation. Biosphere evapotranspiration, surface roughness, and albedo are key controls in the general circulation of the atmosphere: climate models that lack adequate specifications for these biosphere attributes fail.

The relative impacts of selected natural gas and propane vehicle technologies are compared for the year 2005. The chosen natural gas technology imposes large reductions in nonmethane hydrocarbon emissions with moderate reductions in nitrogen oxide emissions, while the propane technology greatly lowers nitrogen oxide emissions with only small changes to nonmethane hydrocarbon emissions. The model results showed that replacing the entire light-duty gasoline car and truck fleet with the selected natural gas vehicle technology in the year 2005 in the Canadian portion of the Lower Fraser Valley yielded significant benefits in terms of reducing potential exposures to elevated ozone levels in suburban and rural areas. Sites closer to the urban core were less affected. For the propane fuel substitution, benefits were realized in terms of lowering ozone concentrations and ozone exposures in the rural areas. Within the urban and suburban areas, ozone exposures tended to increase. The exposures to peroxyacetyl nitrate were universally smaller in the alternative fuel scenarios. The nature of an effective control strategy for the Lower Fraser Valley is discussed, and it is suggested that in addition to the propane fuel substitution, moderate controls on the primary NOx sources in conjunction with moderate nonmethane hydrocarbon controls could be the preferred route to lower ozone exposures.",,"alternative fuel; ozone; photochemistry; traffic emission; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032455989

S7N 3H5, Canada","Snow accumulation and ablation processes are particularly important to the hydrology of cold climate forests. In order to calculate the distribution of snow cover and the loss of snow to sublimation, the amount of snowfall intercepted by forest canopies must be determined. This paper introduces a physically-based snowfall interception model that scales snowfall interception processes from branch to canopy. Previous models of snow interception have neglected the persistent presence and subsequent unloading of intercepted snow in cold climates and hence have only been applicable to regions where snow is quickly lost from the canopy. To investigate how snow is intercepted at the forest stand scale, measurements of wind speed, air temperature, above- and below-canopy snowfall, accumulation of snow on the ground and the load of snow intercepted by a suspended, weighed, full-size conifer were collected from spruce and pine stands in the southern boreal forest. These data show that interception increases at a declining rate with increasing snowfall, to a point where the intercepted load overcomes the strength of branches to support it. Leaf area, tree species and initial canopy snow load determine the snow storage capacity of the canopy. These factors, canopy coverage and snowfall are used to calulate snow interception, presuming an exponential decay in incremental interception as cumulative snowfall increases. The subsequent unloading of intercepted snow is additionally modelled as an exponential function of time. The sensitivity of the combined model to temperature, wind speed, snowfall, snow load and canopy structure is examined for weekly time-steps. The examination shows that interception efficiency is particularly sensitive to snowfall amount, canopy density and time since snowfall. A comparison of the model with weekly measurements of snow interception suggests that the method can be used to caluculate snow interception successfully in a physically-based manner.A physically-based snowfall interception model that scales snowfall interception processes from branch to canopy was developed.

The observations were made with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE) over a period of 3 weeks. The spectrum is well described by a power law with a photon index of 1.86 0.01 that is exponentially cutoff at high energies. Excess soft emission above the power law is present as well as a weak Fe-K line. This is the first truly simultaneous broadband (2.5-250 keV) spectrum of a type I burst source in the hard state. The spectrum is consistent with other hard-state burster spectra that cover either only the soft (1-20 keV) or hard (≳20 keV) bands or cover both, but not simultaneously. The cutoff power-law spectrum resembles that of black hole candidates in their low states observed with RXTE. We compare the SAX J 1808.4-3658 spectrum to three black hole candidates and find that the power law is somewhat softer.

Healthy subjects were tested under two conditions that involved selective or divided attention between local and global levels of hierarchical letter stimuli in order to determine whether and where hemispheric differences might exist in the processing of local versus global information. When attention was divided between global and local levels, the N2 component of the ERPs (260- to 360-msec latency) elicited by the target stimuli showed asymmetries in amplitude over the two hemispheres. The N2 to local targets was larger over the left hemisphere, but the N2 to global targets tended to be slightly larger over the right hemisphere. However, the shorter-latency, sensory-evoked P1 component (90- to 150-msec latency) was not different for global versus local targets under conditions of divided attention. In contrast, during selective attention to either global or local targets, asymmetries in the N2 component were not observed. But under selective attention conditions, the sensory-evoked P1 components in the extrastriate cortex were enlarged for global versus local attention. Increased regional cerebral blood flow in the posterior fusiform gyrus bilaterally was observed in the PET data during selective attention to either global or local targets, but neither these nor the P1 component showed any tendency toward hemispheric difference for global versus local attention. Neither were there any activations observed in the parietal lobe during selective attention to global versus local targets. Together these data indicate that early sensory inputs are not modulated to gate global versus local information differentially into the two hemispheres. Rather, later stages of processing that may be asymmetrically organized in the left and right hemispheres operate in parallel to process global and local aspects of complex stimuli (i.e., the N2 effect of the ERPs). This pattern of results supports models proposing that spatial frequency analysis is only asymmetric at higher stages of perceptual processing and not at the earliest stages of visual cortical analysis.",,"adult; article; attention; brain blood flow; clinical article; controlled study; event related potential; female; frequency analysis; hemisphere; human; human experiment; left hemisphere; male; nerve cell stimulation; normal human; parietal lobe; perception; positron emission tomography; priority journal; right hemisphere; selective attention; sensory stimulation; vision; visual cortex; Adult; Attention; Brain Mapping; Conditioning (Psychology); Evoked Potentials; Female; Fixation, Ocular; Form Perception; Humans; Male; Neurons, Afferent; Photic Stimulation; Tomography, Emission-Computed; Visual Cortex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031844290

The availability of representative, good quality soil data is frequently a limiting factor for biogeochemical modelling, particularly those involving modelling at various spatial scales. This study tests the sensitivity of MAGIC to soil input data derived from two different methodologies; the 'nearest neighbour method' considers the closest representative soil profile to a catchment, and the 'spatial weighting method' of all soil types identified in a catchment, based on a soil physico-chemical classification of Scotland. Soil data (soil depth, density, cation exchange capacity and base saturation) calculated using the 'nearest neighbour method' and the 'spatial weighting method' were highly variable, although the range of upper and lower limits were greater for soil data produced using the nearest neighbour method. In contrast to the predominantly organic soil data calculated by the nearest neighbour method, the spatially weighted soil parameters included a greater proportion of mineral soils. With regard to simulated surface water Acid Neutralising Capacity (ANC) for 1851, 1997 and 2050, MAGIC predictions were similar irrespective of the methodology used to determine soil input parameters. However, soil input data derived from both methods resulted in variable base saturation predictions. It is concluded that the 'nearest neighbour' methodology is most appropriate if the objective is to determine the predicted response of the most acid-sensitive sites within a region in line with the approach used in Critical Load mapping. On the other hand, 'spatial weighting' integrates catchment soils and represents a more robust methodology by which to determine changes in median soil and water response in a regional context. The anticipated reductions in S emissions associated with the Second S Protocol are predicted to have a marginal beneficial effect on the recovery of soils and surface waters of Scotland.",,"acidification; estimation method; model; soil property; Scotland; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032445258

Northwest National Laboratory 1, MS K8-93, PO Box 999, Richland, WA 99352, United States","The reaction of CO2 and H2O to form bicarbonate (HCO3-) was examined on the nearly perfect and vacuum annealed surfaces of TiO2(110) with temperature programmed desorption (TPD), static secondary ion mass spectrometry (SSIMS) and high resolution electron energy loss spectrometry (HREELS). The vacuum annealed TiO2(110) surface possesses oxygen vacancy sites that are manifested in electronic EELS by a loss feature at 0.75 V. These oxygen vacancy sites bind CO2 only slightly more strongly (TPD peak at 166 K) than do the five-coordinated Ti4+ sites (TPD peak at 137 K) typical of the nearly perfect TiO2(110) surface. Vibrational HREELS indicates that CO2 is linearly bound at the latter sites with a va(OCO) frequency similar to the gas phase value. In contrast, oxygen vacancies dissociate H2O to bridging OH groups which recombine to liberate H2O in TPD at 490 K. No evidence for a reaction between CO2 and H2O is detected on the nearly perfect surface. In sequentially dosed experiments on the vacuum annealed surface at 110 K, CO2 adsorption is blocked by the presence of preadsorbed H2O, adsorbed CO2 is displaced by postdosed H2O, and there is little or no evidence for bicarbonate formation in either case. However, when CO2 and H2O are simultaneously dosed, a new CO2 TPD state is observed at 213 K, and the 166 K state associated with CO2 at the vacancies is absent. SSIMS was used to tentatively assign the 213 K CO2 TPD state to a bicarbonate species. The 213 K CO2 TPD state is not formed if the vacancy sites are filled with OH groups prior to simultaneous CO2+H2O exposure. Sticking coefficient measurements suggest that CO2 adsorption at 110 K is precursor-mediated, as is known to be the case for H2O adsorption on TiO2(110). A model explaining the circumstances under which the proposed bicarbonate species is formed involves the surface catalyzed conversion of a precursor-bound H2O-CO2 van der Waals complex to carbonic acid, which then reacts at unoccupied oxygen vacancies to generate bicarbonate, but falls apart to CO2 and H2O in the absence of these sites. This model is consistent with the conditions under which bicarbonate is formed on powdered TiO2, and is similar to the mechanism by which water catalyzes carbonic acid formation in aqueous solution. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.","Carbon dioxide; Chemisorption; Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS); Secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS); Single crystal surfaces; Surface chemical reaction; Thermal desorption spectroscopy (TDS); Titanium dioxide; Water","Annealing; Carbon dioxide; Carbonates; Catalysis; Chemisorption; Dissociation; Electron energy loss spectroscopy; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Single crystals; Temperature programmed desorption; Vacuum applications; Water; Bicarbonates; Sticking coefficient; Titanium dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032028184

Our study supports three principal conclusions. First, although low levels of CO2 chemoreceptor stimulation reduce R-R intervals and R-R interval variability, statistical modeling suggests that this effect is indirect rather than direct and is mediated by reductions of arterial pressure. Second, reductions of R-R intervals during hypocapnia reflect simple shifting of vagally mediated carotid baroreflex responses on the R-R interval axis rather than changes of baroreflex gain, range, or operational point. Third, the influence of CO2 chemoreceptor stimulation on arterial pressure (and, derivatively, on R-R intervals and R-R interval variability) depends critically on baseline arterial pressure levels: chemoreceptor effects are smaller when pressure is low and larger when arterial pressure is high.","Defense reaction; Hyperventilation; Sympathetic innervation; Vagal baroreceptor","carbon dioxide; adult; aorta pressoreceptor; article; breathing rate; chemoreceptor reflex; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; female; Fourier transformation; human; human experiment; hypercapnia; hyperoxia; hyperventilation; hypocapnia; male; normal human; priority journal; solitary tract nucleus; sympathetic innervation; tidal volume",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031831769

In semi-arid climates, which applies to most parts of Spain, the surface water resources need to be stored in reservoirs to counteract the seasonal and annual irregularity of the rainfall. Therefore, reservoirs have been used as a solution on many occasions in the past and this situation will doubtless continue in the future, so that the required extra water resources can be obtained to increase the service guarantee, meet the demands of new users and adjust to the per capita consumption. The present greater environmental awareness and desire to protect nature has aroused the controversy concerning the need to drown areas of land with reservoirs in a quest to obtain the additional water resources required, instead of using other alternatives. With a view to identifying the pros and cons of the main options, accounts are given regarding: a) desalination of sea water; b) recycling waste water; c) water-saving; d) water markets; e) increased hydrogeological resources, and f) increase in surface resources. It can be deduced from the analysis that many of the arguments used must be suitably qualified, because all options have costs and difficulties. The basic need is to identify from the outset all the possible options which partially or totally solve the problem. An analysis of all the costs and environmental effects will make it possible to select the most suitable solutions, programme the activities involved and estimate their costs and the corresponding investment figures, as well as the financing needs. Delays and stoppages to the chosen solutions for specific projects will thus be prevented if the environmental assessment organisations have access to this information at an early stage in the proceedings. It will also be possible to eliminate imbalances between demands and resources and the appearance of dramatic situations during periods of drought, which will inevitably occur in our climate. The cases of delays and stoppages are described for two reservoirs in Madrid and Malaga, respectively, in order to show their effects. In both cases, their absence or presence made a major difference to the management strategy during the most recent drought in Spain.The current environmental awareness and desire to protect nature has aroused the controversy concerning the need to drown areas of land with reservoirs in a quest to obtain additional water resources required in Spain, instead of using other alternatives.

Diverting BMSW from landfills to a composting facility could produce substantial short-term global warming benefits. Although composting does not produce CH4, the process of composting and the application of finished compost on land produce large quantities of CO2. Therefore, to assess the global warming benefits of composting, methods are required to estimate the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction achieved by implementing composting instead of landfilling. The carbon off-set potential model, or the COP model, developed for the specific purpose of determining carbon off-set potential of various waste management alternatives is presented in this paper. The model incorporates a Life Cycle Approach. Although all activities related to the competing waste management alternatives are considered, only the ones emitting significant GHGs are included in the model. A model application is presented. The COP model estimates a net benefit of about 1.2 million tonnes of carbon equivalents (TOCEs), or about 60% net TOCE reductions, by composting 215,000 tonnes of MSW and 22,500 dry tonnes of digested bio-solids annually over 30 years, instead of landfilling MSW and direct application of bio-solids on land.",,"Biodegradation; Carbon dioxide; Composting; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Land fill; Mathematical models; Methane; Biodegradable municipal solid wastes (BMSW); Biosolids; Carbon offset potential model; Greenhouse gas; Solid wastes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032284679

In this instance, we have learned how to take water and land influences into account when predicting changes in meteorology. But we have now stepped beyond the standard meteorological view of coasts affecting air through their complexity, to a new awareness that deposition from the air affects the coastal environment. It is along the coasts that the terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric media come into most intimate contact, and where any one of them can affect any other. The importance of the interaction is becoming even more apparent as the population of coastal areas continues to grow, and as demands for energy, food, and recreation are growing even faster. The interactions among the terrestrial, aquatic, and atmospheric media are central in considerations of what must be done to protect an increasingly stressed coastal environment from what could soon be irreversible damage. To generate the understanding necessary to underpin regulations and emissions control strategies, accurate models of pollutant behavior in all of the media must be constructed, and these must then be integrated to protect against the imposition of ineffective controls. The challenges for the atmospheric sciences are daunting. Not only must atmospheric deposition become a focus of attention, but mesoscale models must be constructed to provide the spatial information that existing coarse monitoring networks are incapable of providing alone.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0342389328

Most notable are the presence of HOM emission between 270° and 120° central meridian longitude (CML) and the region of reduced emission intensity (a ""gap"") between 120° and 270°. We displayed the Ulysses and Galileo data using time-frequency occurrence probability spectrograms and show that the observed HOM emission features are nearly identical to those observed by the Voyager spacecraft. This implies that the HOM structure is long-lived and fixed in its longitudinal position within the Jovian magnetosphere. HOM structure depends on small changes in the observer's jovigraphic latitude, so the different jovigraphic latitudes of the spacecraft were used to probe the HOM beam structure. From this analysis we found that the CML width of the main HOM gap is directly correlated to the latitude of the spacecraft. We conclude that the latitudinal thickness of the HOM beam is about 12°, extending from -5° to +7° magnetic latitude.

The EHMO calculations on trans-[PtL2-Me3]+ L = PH3, show that the regular trigonal-bipyramidal (TBP) structure has an orbitally degenerate ground state and should undergo distortion to either the square-pyramidal (SP) or pinched trigonal-bipyramidal (PTBP) structure. In the PTBP structure, two methyl groups are in close proximity (C-Pt-C ca. 70°) and tilted away from each other. Although the tilting leads to a close Pt⋯HC contact, no attractive agostic Pt⋯H bonding is indicated. The DFT calculations predict that C-H reductive elimination and oxidative addition are much easier than C-C reductive elimination and oxidative addition, but there is no major difference between the activation energies when L = NH3 or PH3. However, the platmum-(IV) complexes are relatively more stable when L = NH3 than when L = PH3 compared to the platinum(II) alkane complexes, and so the activation energies for C-H or C-C oxidative addition are calculated to be lower for the NH3 complexes. The platinum(IV) complexes with ligands L mutually cis or trans are most stable in the SP or PTBP stereochemistry, respectively In the platinum(II) alkane complexes, the stereochemistry with ligands L mutually trans is preferred. The oxidative-addition/reductive-elimination reactions occur by a concerted mechanism, probably with a PTBP complex on the reaction coordinate. For C-H reductive elimination, the methane remains coordinated to platinum through the C-H σ complex For C-C reductive elimination, the transition state is a C-C σ complex but in the final ethane complex the binding is as a C-H σ complex. For methane complexes the binding is η3 but one platinum C-H contact is shorter than the other, while for ethane complexes, the binding is usually η4 through two eclipsed platinum C-H σ-complex interactions, but one appears much stronger than the other. The weaker of these σ-complex interactions is just strong enough to overcome the tendency of ethane to adopt the staggered conformation (ca. 3 kcal mol-1).

The region is situated ~250 km away from the Icelandic rift-axis, and is characterized by low-temperature (&lt;100°C) hydrothermal activity. A mantle-derived input dominates the helium systematics: nine localies have 3He/4He ratios (R/RA) values between those typical of MORB (8±1) and 30-the highest value matches the most extreme magmatic ratios reported worldwide to date. Four other localities have R/RA~MORB ratios with the remaining three showing heavy dilution with crustal radiogenic helium (R/RA&lt;MORB). Carbon isotope analysis of seven of the localities reveals a wide range in δ13C(CO2)(-6 to -16‰ PDB), and CO2/3He ratios vary over 4 orders of magnitude (4×106 to 2.9×1010). There appears no systematic relationship between the volatile systematics and geographic distribution or age of reservoir rocks. Stable isotope (δ18O and δD) variations are consistent with a localized meteoric origin for the hydrothermal waters-the carrier phase of the volatiles. We conclude that release of magmatic volatiles in Vestfirdir occurs predominately via incipient mantle melting with a negligible input of re-distributed volatiles from the rift zones. It is also highly unlikely that leaching of old reservoir rocks contribute to the mantle volatile flux: however, release of radiogenic helium from the uppermost crust does occur and this is accompanied by addition of isotopically light carbon most likely of organic orgin. The light carbon input is most discernible when the mantle-derived carbon signal is reduced-most probably by reaction to form calcite. Although Vestfirdir makes a discernible (off-axis) input to the degassing history of the Icelantic hotspot, its contribution is extremely minor (~0.04%) when compared to the degassing flux associated with rifting and volcanism along the Icelandic spreading zones.",,"degassing; helium isotope; hot spot; hydrothermal activity; mantle plume; Iceland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032584794

In southern Norway, acidification due to long-range transported air pollutants is one of the most serious environmental problems, affecting an area of 80,000 km2. To preserve and restore biodiversity, Norweigan authorities have chosen liming as a temporary mitigation measure. Critical load estimates were used to estimate the material and financial needs for this large-scale program. In 1995, more than 2000 localities ranging from small lakes to large salmon rivers were limed. Liming costs in 1996 were $18 million (U.S.). Critical load estimates also formed the basis for international negotiations on sulfur emission reductions, resulting in the second sulfur protocol for Europe and North America in 1994. The critical load estimates indicated that acidified areas in Norway would be reduced to 35,000 km2 after the year 2010, after the commitments of the sulfur protocols are met. By that time, estimated liming costs would be reduced by almost 40%. Lime treatment of River Tovdalselva, with a catchment area of 1885 km2, is probably the largest integrated liming project in the world. In 1990 the critical load was exceeded in 98% of the Tovdalselva catchment.

For instance, the new design will have a volume of ∼0.25 m3, mass of 20-25 kg, and power of 50 watts, compared with the successful Shuttle-borne Atmospheric Trace Molecule Spectroscopy (ATMOS) FTS with ∼1 m3, 250 kg, and 200 watts. This development is founded on advances in materials for lightweight stable structures, materials with piezoelectric properties, detectors, electronics, on-board digital signal processing, and miniature, frequency-stable lasers. Together these advances address all the major elements of an FTS that dictate the instrument volume and mass and will enable the development of revolutionary instrumentation for scientific missions in space. The new FTS can operate in emission mode in the infrared region, and also in absorption mode in the infrared and visible regions, enabling wide application in variety of remote sensing of the Earth's atmosphere for the study of meteorology, atmospheric chemistry and circulation, and climate change, and planetary exploration. The design study is currently in progress under the NASA's New Millennium Program. The design concept and potential application for space programs in the years 2000 and beyond is discussed. © 1998 IEEE.",,"Application programs; Atmospheric chemistry; Bolometers; Climate change; Digital signal processing; Earth atmosphere; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Interplanetary spacecraft; Laser materials processing; NASA; Remote sensing; Space optics; Spectrometers; Digital signal processing; Fourier transforms; Light weight structures; Remote sensing; Space applications; Telemetering; Advanced technology; Atmospheric remote sensing; Atmospheric trace molecule spectroscopies; Fourier transform spectrometers; New millennium programs; Piezoelectric property; Planetary exploration; Remote sensing instruments; Spacecraft instruments; Infrared spectrometers; Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031644852

In the implementation plan, EPA proposes that any area now meeting ozone standards and areas that have not had violations for three years would be classified as `transitional' areas provided the State would submit a new State Implementation Plan (SIP) by Year 2000, and/or participate in the regional ozone reduction recommendations specified by the Ozone Transport Assessment Group (OTAG). In following the President's direction of a flexible and less burdensome implementation approach, EPA is proposing several options for the transitional ozone areas to meet their conformity requirements without unnecessary modeling and regulatory burdens. One of the options being proposed is to allow Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs) using long term (20 years) vehicle miles traveled (VMT) projections to provide a basis for a qualitative statement that no violations will be caused or worsened. In other words, EPA is assuming that VMT can and will be significant in determining an area's potential ozone exceedances. The purpose of this analysis is to explore whether EPA's assumption is plausible. The data on VMT and the number of ozone exceedances from various nonattainment areas lead us to question EPA's assumption. This analysis is intended to first find out whether VMT and ozone occurrence are related, and second, how strong the relationship is if it exists. The results of a chi-square test and a regression analysis show that even though there is a relationship between the number of ozone exceedances and daily VMT in these nine areas, the relationship (R2 = 0.2097) is so weak that daily VMT cannot be used as the only factor to explain the variation of the number of ozone exceedances while ignoring other contributing factors, such as meteorological factors (temperature, wind, etc.), other sources of emissions, and geography of the areas. The paper was concluded by a brief discussion of the policy implications of this option and some possible modifications of this approach.",,"Air pollution control; Air quality; Correlation methods; Meteorology; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Public policy; Regression analysis; Standards; Chi square tests; Vehicle miles traveled (VMT); Environmental protection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031676319

These experiments include the effects of changes in temperature, light, CO2, and nutrients, so the model could be applied to five regions comprising the entire Kuparuk River basin. Net primary production, averaged for the entire basin, was 92 g C m-2 yr-1. A 150 year simulation of carbon storage under a doubling of CO2 (slow ramp-up) and a temperature increase of 3.5°C gave an estimate of +400 g C m-2 when soil moisture increased and +500 g C m-2 when soil moisture decreased. Drier soils stimulated decomposition producing an increase in nitrogen availability; the increased N led to increased net primary production. If this result is applicable to other arctic ecosystems, then it is unlikely that warming will enhance carbon loss to the atmosphere to further enhance warming.

Two potential sources for reductions of aerobic capacities were hypothesized: 1) the adaptations to CO2 such as reduction in H(+)-buffer capacities which may influence muscle metabolism; 2) the reduced physical activities which may lead to a detraining effect. Four subjects were exposed to 0.7% and 1.2% CO2 concentration in a confined compartment for 23 d each with 3 mo in between the two campaigns. A combined exercise test was applied before, during (on days 5, 11, and 22) and after CO2 exposure. Comparing steady-states at 30 W and 80 W power, elevated ventilation was found increased during CO2 exposure with significant differences between the two campaigns. Peak oxygen uptake decreased over the period of CO2 exposure, but was found not significantly different on day 5 compared to pre-exposure measurements. This decrease was not dependent on the CO2 concentration. The lactate concentration at low exercise intensities was found elevated during CO2 exposure. A shift in reverse direction was observed after the CO2 exposure. Since peak oxygen uptake did not differ on day 5 and the lactate concentration was found increased, it was concluded that the potential changes in muscle metabolism by adaptation to elevated CO2 concentrations did not influence the aerobic capacities. Therefore, it was concluded that the changes in aerobic capacities are the result of the reduced physical activities of the subjects while living in the confined compartment.",,"carbon dioxide; adaptation; adult; article; blood gas analysis; chronic disease; drug effect; exercise test; exercise tolerance; fitness; human; hypercapnia; lung ventilation; male; metabolism; microclimate; oxygen consumption; pathophysiology; Adaptation, Physiological; Adult; Blood Gas Analysis; Carbon Dioxide; Chronic Disease; Ecological Systems, Closed; Exercise Test; Exercise Tolerance; Humans; Hypercapnia; Male; Oxygen Consumption; Physical Fitness; Pulmonary Ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032042292

At present, about 92% of the solution gas is collected for processing and the remainder is flared. In recent years, there has been a growing concern over solution gas flaring because of the potential health effects of bi-products of incomplete combustion from the process. Reduction of gas flaring is seen as a logical approach to this problem. This paper provides a critical analysis of the solution gas flaring situation in Alberta. Potential technological alternatives available to reduce flaring are presented. The study addresses the potential improvements which are achievable with the following technologies: Collection in a low-pressure gas system, electrical generation with gas turbines, electrical generation with 'mini' turbines, cogeneration, co-disposal with produced water, and oxidation. The study has found that electrical generation could economically reduce flare gas emissions in the province. Co-disposal with produced water has the potential to reduce emissions at a reasonable cost at sites where a produced water disposal well already exists. Collection of gas in a low-pressure gas system has the potential to gather gas from several sites in close proximity to allow sufficient gas volumes to proceed with electrical generation or other end uses. Cogeneration has little potential as an electrical demand, a need for steam, and sufficient quantities of waste gas are all required at the same site.

The SAFALY code consisting of a zero-dimensional plasma model and a one-dimensional heat transfer model of components has been modified to take account of the divertor plasma state transition on the basis of the updated divertor plasma physics. Several plasma events, i.e., over fueling, sudden auxiliary heating injection and Confinement improvement events which would be expected to result in overpower, were selected for the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor (ITER) and the transient behaviors were calculated on the assumption of a combined failure of plasma control and machine interlock in addition with a postulated plasma transient. The results show that plasma burning passively terminates due to sublimated impurity penetration from the carbon target surface, but there are possibilities of dry out of the coolant for the high heat flux in sudden attached state transition under the multifailure of plasma control. However, effects by the aggravating failure of the divertor are expected to be safely terminated by the confinement boundary, the vacuum vessel and its pressure suppression system. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Attached plasma; Beta limit; Density limit; Detached plasma; Disruption; Divertors; Fusion reactors; Impurities; ITER TOKAMAK; Plasma dynamics; Safety analysis; Thermal analysis; Transient behavior","Accident prevention; Computer aided analysis; Computer simulation; Computer software; Experimental reactors; Failure analysis; Heat flux; Loss of coolant accidents; Mathematical models; Plasma confinement; Plasma theory; Thermoanalysis; Divertors; International thermonuclear experimental reactors (ITER); Plasma physics; Pressure suppression systems; Software package SAFALY; Vacuum vessels; Tokamak devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032269065

Surface water was sampled from the Columbia, Satilla, Susquehanna and Parker Rivers and groundwater was sampled from the Childs River. Several geochemical descriptors (percent organic matter of suspended particulate matter, C/N, lignin phenol content, ratio of vanillic acid to vanillin) suggested an ordering of the systems with respect to POM lability: Satilla &lt; Parker &lt; Columbia &lt; Susquehanna. DOC concentrations in these systems ranged from &lt; 100 μM for the Columbia River to &gt;2000 μM for the Satilla River. Elemental analysis of DOM concentrates (&gt; 1000 D) was used to predict organic matter composition and to calculate degree of substrate reduction using two different modeling approaches. Models predicted aliphatic carbon ranging between 43 and 60% and aromatic carbon between 26 and 36%, with aliphatic content lowest in the Satilla and highest in the Columbia River. The degree of substrate reduction of the organic matter concentrates followed a pattern similar to that for aliphatic C, being lowest in the Satilla (3.5) and highest in the Columbia (4.0). Extracellular enzyme activity varied broadly across the systems, but again ordered sites in the same way as did aliphatic content and degree of substrate reduction. Bacterial growth rates ranged from 1.3 ug mg-1 d-1 DOC in the Satilla to 1.7 ug mg-1 d-1 DOC in the Parker River. Bioassays confirmed patterns of dissolved organic matter lability predicted by the chemical models. Between 67% to 75% of the variation in bacterial growth could be explained by differences in organic matter composition.","Elemental composition; Lability; Organic carbon; Organic nitrogen; Rivers","United States; bioavailability; estuarine chemistry; geochemistry; groundwater; organic matter; river water; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7844228771

We show that classical load-sharing techniques combined with careful analysis of Amdahl's law can be successfully used to significantly increase the performance of the code. This report describes the quantitative analysis of these factors and the solutions used to diminish or eliminate their effects. By slightly modifying the code we reduced its sequential portion to less than 0.1%. We also demonstrate that the MPI collective communications implementation on the Cray T3E dramatically reduces the communication overhead for our code. In the end, a speedup of 170 was obtained using 256 Cray T3E processing elements.

The nido-carboranes where R = n-Bu (I), t-Eu. (II) are newly reported and were obtained from the reaction of Me3SiC≡CR with B5H9. The tetracarbon compounds were minor products of the reactions, with yields ranging from 13% for VIII to 37% for XI; the major products were the corresponding closo-1-(SiMe3)-2-(R)-1,2-C2B4H4 compounds, which were obtained in yields from 69% (R = t-Eu (VI)) to 32% (R = SiMe3). The closo-carboranes where R = n-Bu (V), t-Bu (VI) could be converted to the more stable closo-1-(SiMe3)-6-(R)-1,6-C2B4H4 (R = n-Bu (IX), t-Bu(X)) by heating to 250-255 °C for 4-5 h; this agrees with previous studies on the compounds where R = SiMe3, Me. To aid in cage structure determination, a monobrominated, tetracarbon carborane, XV, was prepared from the reaction of VII with Br2 in n-hexane, in 46% yield. All compounds were characterized by their 1H, 11B, and 13C NMR spectra and elemental analyses and by the following: I-XIV by their IR spectra; III, IV, VII-X, XIII, and XIV by mass spectrometry; and III, IV, XI, XII, and XV by single-crystal X-ray crystallography. Depending on the structures of the C4B8 cages, the compounds could be classified as having ""carbons apart"" structures, in which all cage carbons were separated by at least one boron atom (III, IV, VII, VIII, XIV, and XV), or ""carbons adjacent"" structures, in which the carbons were localized on the same side of the clusters (XI-XIII). Compound III is unique in that its structure is that of a distorted cuboctahedron, while IV and XV are nido-carboranes having a C3B3 face that surmounts a B5 ring and an apical cage carbon atom; none of the rings are planar, and the apical carbon is unequally bonded to the B5 ring atoms. Similarities in their NMR spectra indicate that VII and VIII have structures similar to IV and XV. Two types of ""carbons adjacent"" cages were identified: one typified by XI, in which the four cage carbons are bonded contiguously, and a more open cage, in which the bond between the middle two carbons is broken (XII). All of the C4B8 compounds were found to have nonrigid stereochemistries; both the 11B and 13C NMR spectra of the ""carbons apart"" compounds consisted of single resonance peaks, indicating rapid atom equilibration on the NMR time scale. The ""carbons adjacent"" compounds showed 11B NMR spectra of six resonance peaks; each had a different chemical shift and peak-area ratio pattern. The 11B NMR spectra of the ""carbons apart"" isomers could be successfully accounted for by using GIAO ab initio molecular orbital chemical shift calculations at the B3LYP/6-311G** level of theory on the B3LYP/6-31G* optimized geometries of a set of model compounds, III′, IV′, and XV′, which had H's as substituents on the cage carbons. However, neither similar calculations on the ""carbons adjacent"" carboranes nor comparisons with the spectra of carboranes haying similar structures could successfully account for the 11B NMR spectra of XI-XHL It was speculated that the presence of two different substituents on the cage carbons of these compounds gives rise in solution to multiple isomers that would greatly complicate their NMR spectra. © 1998 American Chemical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000192505

This paper discusses how the same basic qualities of the air-assist fuel system and combustion process have been applied to automotive 4-stroke engines. The inherent qualities of the air- assist fuel system in combination with careful design of the combustion chamber has enabled high charge stratification with late injection timings and very stable combustion over a wide range of operating conditions. Experimental test data from a 4-cylinder, 16 valve 4-stroke development engine demonstrates the ability of this low pressure system to operate at very lean air/fuel ratios, with part load fuel economy improvements of up to 34 % at an operating condition equivalent to a vehicle speed of 40 km/hr. Results presented from steady state simulation of the New European Drive Cycle also demonstrate an overall base engine fuel economy improvement of over 20%, whilst achieving NOx emissions reductions of over 85% and HC emissions comparable to the baseline port injected (MPI) engine. As a result of the combined NOx, fuel economy and HC control of the Orbital Combustion process, the authors have proposed an alternative exhaust aftertreatment strategy to the still unproven and expensive lean NOx catalyst options. In particular, steady state results show how the low raw emissions of the air-assisted DI system developed could enable a conventional 3-way catalyst system to be utilised to meet Stage 3 European emissions levels with a minimal impact on the DI fuel economy advantage.

The problem of a changing climate is related to not only climate, energy consumption and emissions of greenhouse gases, but also effects of such a change on the earth's ecosystems, resources and human settlements, as well as the need to reduce or avoid these effects. In this study, an inexact-fuzzy multiobjective programming model was proposed for adaptation planning of land resources management in the Mackenzie Basin under changing climate. This integrated adaptation planning enables the inclusion of systems interaction and feedback mechanisms and can therefore yield insights that scattered information cannot offer. Many sectors were considered, including agriculture, forest, wildlife habitat preservation, wetland preservation, hunting, recreation, and soil conservation, as well as their interactive relationships. The results indicate that uncertain, multiobjective, dynamic and interactive features of the study system have been effectively reflected. Temporal variations of land characteristics and land-use activities exist due to changes in climatic, economic and environmental conditions. However, through effective systems analysis and planning, the desired land-use patterns for adapting to the changing climate and compromising objectives from different stakeholders could be obtained.

The IR results of reductive carbonylation of calcined RhCl3/SiO2 have been compared to those of uncalcined RhCl3/SiO2 at 373 K. In situ IR observations, extraction results and elemental analysis suggest that approximately 50% of RhCl3 are transformed to Rh2O3 on the SiO2 surface and that calcined RhCl3/SiO2 is converted to a mixture of [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 and [Rh(CO)2Os]2 (Os: surface oxygen) under CO at 373 K. When this SiO2-supported mixture was submitted to impregnation with a Co2(CO)8 solution at room temperature, IR study and elemental analysis show that [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 reacts easily with Co2(CO)8 on the surface to give RhCo3(CO)12, whereas [Rh(CO)2O2]2 does not react with Co2(CO)8. Catalytic study in steady-state ethylene hydroformylation shows that a catalyst thus derived is more active than a catalyst derived from RhCo3(CO)12/SiO2 and a catalyst derived by coimpregnation of [Rh(CO)2Cl]2 and Co2(CO)8 on SiO2.

One potential way to do this is the development of predictive models. With an understanding of the processes of methane production, oxidation and emission, a semi-empirical model, focused on the contributions of rice plants to the processes and also the influence of environmental factors, was developed to predict methane emission from flooded rice fields. A simplified version of the model was also derived to predict methane emission in a more practical manner. In this study, it was hypothesized that methanogenic substrates are primarily derived from rice plants and added organic matter. Rates of methane production in flooded rice soils are determined by the availability of methanogenic substrates and the influence of environmental factors. Rice growth and development control the fraction of methane emitted. The amount of methane transported from the soil to the atmosphere is determined by the rates of production and the emitted fraction. Model validation against observations from single rice growing seasons in Texas, USA demonstrated that the seasonal variation of methane emission is regulated by rice growth and development. A further validation of the model against measurements from irrigated rice paddy soils in various regions of the world, including Italy, China, Indonesia, Philippines and the United States, suggests that methane emission can be predicted from rice net productivity, cultivar character, soil texture and temperature, and organic matter amendments.","CH4 emission; Flooded rice soils; Global warming; Model; Rice plant control","emission estimation; methane emission; model; rice paddy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031859626

Based on the measured results, the amount of unburned hydrocarbons from the crevice and liner has been predicted. It was found that the temperature of the piston top-land and cylinder liner took about 150-200 s to reach its equilibrium state as the engine started up. The concentration of hydrocarbons from the top-land crevice and from the oil layer will be reduced to 40 and 75 per cent of its initial value respectively. It is considered that a reduction in piston thermal capacity can reduce the total unburned hydrocarbons during this transient period owing to quick minimization of the top-land crevice volume and rapid increase in mixture temperature in the crevice region. © IMechE 1998.","Cold start; Hydrocarbon emissions; Spark ignition engine; Temperature","Gas emissions; Hydrocarbons; Temperature measurement; Cold start; Internal combustion engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032318244

For a period of three successive years the plants were subjected to varying UV-B irradiances. Gas exchange parameters, chlorophyll fluorescence as well as the chlorophyll content were measured. The lowland (R. maritimus) and the montane (R. crispus) species revealed a high UV-B tolerance indicated by their photosynthetic CO2 fixation), even without a preceding adaptation to UV-B irradiance. Only the highest UV-B irradiance applied (6.47 kJ · m-2 · d-1) resulted in a diminished photosynthetic capacity (CO2 fixation) of the lowland species while the other UV-B levels (4.71 kJ · m-2 · d-1 and 5.59 kJ · m-2 · d-1) increased photosynthetic CO2 fixation. By contrast, the alpine species (R. alpinus) required an adaptation to a threshold UV-B irradiance to prevent UV-B caused inhibition of photosynthetic CO2 fixation. The reduced photosynthetic CO2 fixation of the non-adapted R. alpinus seems to be due to the effect of the UV-B radiation on stomatal conductance. There was no correlation between the UV-B effects on components of the photosynthetic electron transport chain and the UV-B effects on photosynthetic CO2 fixation in any of the species studied. The chlorophyll content of all three species was not affected by the applied UV-B levels.","Altitudinal gradient; Chlorophyll; Chlorophyll fluorescence; Gas exchange; Rumex; UV-B radiation","Rumex",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031953677

Much of the information on the rates of this process comes from rivers in the tropics and subtropics. To understand the possible climatic influences systematic studies are needed for the arctic/subarctic regions. This is the second in a series of papers addressing this problem by systematic studies of the pristine rivers of the Russian Far East. The region to the east of the Siberian Platform (Huh et al., 1998) is a geologically complex terrain formed by the Mesozoic collision and accretion of the Siberian and Kolyma plates. Because of the arid continental climate, it has not been glaciated in the recent past. Thus, it is possible to study weathering processes in an arctic environment dominated solely by cryogenic interactions without contamination by heterogeneous components derived from scouring glaciers. All the major rivers and their tributaries in this area have been sampled on expeditions to individual basins (∼100 samples) on a reconnaissance basis at falling stage, usually in July and August. The total dissolved cation levels (TZ+) are moderate (up to ∼3,100 μEq), and the major ion chemistry is indicative of Ca-aluminosilicate and carbonate weathering with significant contributions from black shales in some tributaries. The Si/TZ+*, Si/(Na* + K) and 87Sr/86Sr ratios indicate that the weathering is superficial, i.e., only to cation-rich secondary minerals. The areal total dissolved solid fluxes range from 0.04 to 0.39 × 106 mol/km2/yr, up to an order of magnitude lower than for the Amazon-Orinoco draining the Andes in the tropics (0.6-4.1 × 106 mol/km2/yr). The CO2 consumption by aluminosilicate weathering (18-230 × 103 mol/km2/yr) is also at the lower end of the range observed in the Amazon-Orinoco headwaters (143-1,000 × 103 mol/km2/yr). However, as the North American counterparts in similar latitudes and with comparable relief, the Mackenzie, Yukon, and Fraser draining the Rockies, also have high dissolved solids (0.2-2.9 × 106 mol/km2/yr) and CO2 (19-1,750 × 103 mol/km2/yr) fluxes, these low values seem to be more a function of lithology than simply climate. Ice action in cold environments appears to overcome the inhibiting effects of the decreased temperatures and lack of precipitation in producing a high chemical yield but results in superficial weathering in the case of aluminosilicates.

A climate change scenario is defined using output from one or more climate model experiments, the scenario is run through one or more environmental simulation models, and the impacts of the prescribed climate change evaluated. This approach places a considerable burden on the selection of which climate change scenarios should drive the impacts assessment. An alternative approach for assessing possible impacts of climate change fol-lows a 'bottom-up' (or inverse modelling) approach. Here, the sequence of analysis steps is inverted. An assessment is made of what range of magnitudes and/or rates of regional climate change could be adapted to by an environmental or social exposure unit. The question is then asked of the climate scenario developer, how likely is it that future regional climate change will exceed these limits, and by when? Under what scenario or modelling assumptions will these limits be exceeded? And how do these future changes relate to current climate variability? In this paper we present a systematic approach for considering the effect of a set of scenario and modelling uncertainties on the likelihood of critical climate change being exceeded for particular exposure units. We present this assessment in the context of observed climate change over the last 100 yr and illustrate the approach for the UK and for 2 thresholds of climate change. These are defined, very simplistically, in terms of summer mean temperature and rainfall and as such may nominally be regarded as relating to water resources in the UK. We argue that one of the strongest advantages of this approach is that it disarms those who wield climate change scenarios as though they were in some sense 'predictions' of future climate. By visualising the effects on realised future climate of different modelling assumptions and scenario uncertainties, we make more transparent the judgements that must be made in assessing the significance of climate change impacts on different regional exposure units.","Climate modelling; Climate scenarios; Natural climate variability; Scenario uncertainties; UK climate","climate change; climate scenario; climate variation; modelling; modelling approach; social impact; UK",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031823578

Production of five of these gases, CCl3F (CFC-11), CCl2F2 (CFC-12), CCl2FCClF2 (CFC-113), CH3CCl3 (methyl chloroform), and CCl4 (carbon tetrachloride), is now strictly regulated in the United States and other developed countries under international legislation. C2Cl4 (tetrachloroethene) and SF6 (sulfur hexafluoride) are currently produced without restriction, but requests for voluntary cutbacks in C2Cl4 emissions have been made, at least in the United States. Atmospheric variability of these gases is examined at several sampling heights on the towers, but trends are deduced using only nighttime data at the top sampling level of each tower to minimize variability driven by local emissions and the diurnal cycle of the planetary boundary layer, leaving regional emissions as the main source of day-to-day variability. Significant downward trends are determined for CFC-12, CFC-113, CH3CCl3, and C2Cl4 variability at both towers, reflecting decreased emissions of these gases in two regions of the United States.

A cost benefit evaluation of the social, environmental, and economic benefits from the use of vehicle exhaust catalysts was performed. The economic evaluation was concerned with health effects, and was performed in three steps, i.e., the estimation of emissions from petrol cars of pollutants and the contribution of these emissions to ambient concentrations of pollutants (compared to those equipped with catalysts), the health effects caused by these pollutants (based on dose response functions), and the application of economic values for these health effects. Catalyst abatement technology had a significant effect on reducing emissions from petrol cars with resulting quantifiable health benefits.

It is found that prefrontal wind shifts are associated with both lee troughs and drylines. The climatology reveals that in the central United States fronts are most frequently (up to 60% of them) preceded by wind shifts just east of the Rockies, where lee troughs and drylines originate. This paper focuses on a case study of a prefrontal wind shift associated with a lee trough that forms when a front approaches the lee trough. The prefrontal wind shift associated with the lee trough forms in the lee of the mountains but propagates away from the mountains when downslope flow decreases and warm advection occurs ahead of the wind shift. A cyclone forms along the prefrontal wind shift and propagates southward in part like an edge wave. The front, however, across which there is no cyclonic wind shift, moves faster than the prefrontal wind shift and eventually catches up to it.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0008364729

The C18O presumably traces the total H2 column density, while the SiO traces gas affected by shocks and high temperature chemistry. The J = 2 → 1 line of SiO is seen only in few regions of the Galactic disk. This line is easily detected in all Galactic center sources observed. A comparison of the strength of the rare isotopomers 29SiO and 30SiO to the strength of the main isotopomer 28SiO implies that the J = 2 → 1 transition of 28SiO is optically thick. The 29Si/30Si isotope ratio of 1.6 in the Galactic center clouds is consistent with the terrestrial value. Large Velocity Gradient models show that the dense component (nH2 ≥ 104 cm-3) in typical molecular cores in the Galactic center is cool (Tkin ≈ 25 K), contrary to what is usually found in Giant Molecular Clouds in the disk, where the densest cores are the hottest. High kinetic temperatures, &gt; 100 K, known to exist from NH3 studies, are only present at lower gas densities of a few 103 cm-3, where SiO is highly subthermally excited. Assuming that C18O traces all of the molecular gas, it is found that in all cases but one, SiO emission is compatible with arising in gas at higher density that is (presently) relatively cool. The relative abundance of SiO is typically 10-9, but differs significantly between individual sources. It shows a dependence on the position of the source within the Galactic center region. High abundances are found in those regions for which bar potential models predict a high likelihood for cloud-cloud collisions. These results can be used to relate the amount of gas that has encountered shocks within the last ∼ 106 years to the large scale kinematics in the inner ∼ 500 pc of the Galaxy.","Galaxy: center; ISM: clouds; ISM: molecules; ISM: structure; Radio Lines: ISM",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0039071129

(Poaceae), an exotic Mojave Desert annual grass, grown in ambient (360 μmol mol-1) and elevated (700 μmol mol-1) CO2 to determine if parental CO2 growth conditions affected seed quality. Performance of seeds developed on the above plants was evaluated to determine the influence of parental CO2 growth conditions on germination, growth rate, and leaf production. Seeds of B. rubens developed on parents grown in elevated CO2 had a larger pericarp surface area, higher C:N ratio, and less total mass than ambient-developed seeds. Parental CO2 environment did not have an effect on germination percentage or mean germination time, as determined by radicle emergence. Seedlings from elevated-CO2-developed seeds had a reduced relative growth rate and achieved smaller final mass over the same growth period. Elevated-CO2-developed seeds had smaller seed reserves than ambient seeds, as determined: by growing seedlings in sterile media and monitoring senescence. It appears that increased seed C:N ratios associated with plants grown under elevated CO2 may have a major effect on seed quality (morphology, nutrition) and seedling performance (e.g., growth rate and leaf production). Since the invasive success of B. rubens is primarily due to its ability to rapidly germinate, increase leaf area and maintain a relatively high growth rate compared to native annuals and perennial grasses, reductions in seed quality and seedling performance in elevated CO2 may have significant impacts on future community composition in the Mojave Desert.","Bromus rubens; C/N ratio; Elevated CO2; Maternal effects; Mojave Desert","carbon dioxide; red brome; seed quality; seedling performance; USA, California, Mojave Desert; Bromus rubens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031947338

In this study, artificial blooms of cyanobacteria were exposed to different concentrations of CO2 in the atmosphere and HCO3- in the water. The conditions and photosynthetic activity within the bloom were measured with microelectrodes sensing O2, pH, and light. Net rates of photosynthesis increased with the concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere (air = 350 ppm). However, even under 3,500 ppm CO2, reducing the concentration of inorganic carbon in the water reduced rates of photosynthesis. Thus, both air and water acted as sources of inorganic carbon. Bloom formation may give cyanobacteria an advantage in competition for light and inorganic carbon with other groups of phytoplankton; by placing a dense biomass close to the water surface they are able to intercept a large amount of the flux of light and inorganic carbon. The high surface pH produced in the bloom will promote influx of CO2 from the atmosphere by 'chemical enhancement.' The obvious advantage of being close to the water surface may be offset by the risk of photoinhibition at high photon irradiance. The dense packing of colonies in the bloom furthermore caused a high local demand for inorganic carbon and consequently extreme carbon depletion. This combination of high photon irradiance and carbon limitation proved to be especially detrimental in blooms. When the availability of inorganic carbon was restricted, nonphotochemical quenching of fluorescence increased, showing some removal of excess excitation energy, but not to the extent that photodamage was prevented. Depending on the outcome of several interacting processes, surface bloom formation may be advantageous or deleterious for the cyanobacteria involved. This also depends on the environmental conditions to which cells were acclimated prior to bloom formation. Cyanobacteria have a better chance of withstanding the conditions in surface blooms if the cells were already acclimated to high average irradiance prior to floating to the surface.",,"cyanobacteria; inorganic carbon; nutrient availability; photoinhibition; photosynthesis; Cyanobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031813041

To evaluate these hypotheses, the intracellular pH, [intracellular ionized procaine concentration, and evoked action potentials were measured in crayfish giant axons. Methods: In all measurements, axon preparations from crayfish were perfused extracellularly for 15 min with either bicarbonate-containing solution at pH 7.6 (bicarb/7.6) or bicarbonate-free solution at pH 7.6 (nonbicarb/7.6) or pH 8.0 (nonbicarb/8.0). Intracellular pH was measured using a pH-sensitive microelectrode. Intracellular anesthetic concentration was measured using a specially designed procaine-sensitive microelectrode with each of three solutions containing 1 mM procaine hydrochloride. Membrane potential was measured and, as an index of anesthetic action, the dV/dt of evoked action potential was calculated during perfusion with procaine. Results: Mean intracellular pH was significantly lower in the bicarb/7.6 (7.16 ± 0.07) group than in the nonbicarb/7.6 (7.33 ± 0.09) and nonbicarb/8.0 (7.33 ± 0.12) groups (P < 0.01). The mean intracellular ionized procaine concentration was significantly higher in the bicarb/7.6 (0.53 ± 0.08 mM; P < 0.05) and nonbicarb/8.0 (0.58 ± 0.13 mM; P < 0.01) than in nonbicarb/7.6 (0.32 ± 0.14 mM) group but did not differ between the bicarb/7.6 and nonbicarb/8.0 groups. The mean percentage decrease in dV/dt(max) was approximately coincident with the mean intracellular procaine concentration in each solution. Conclusion: The presence of bicarbonate or extracellular alkalinization increased the intracellular concentration of ionized procaine and the anesthetic effect.","Crayfish; Ion-selective electrodes; Local anesthetics; Microelectrodes; Procaine; Sodium bicarbonate","bicarbonate; local anesthetic agent; procaine; acidification; alkalinization; anesthesia mechanism; animal cell; article; cell ph; controlled study; crayfish; evoked response; giant axon; ionization; local anesthesia; microelectrode; nerve cell membrane potential; nonhuman; priority journal; Action Potentials; Anesthetics, Local; Animals; Astacoidea; Axons; Drug Synergism; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Microelectrodes; Procaine; Sodium Bicarbonate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031779230

In particular, we focus on the case where the continuum formation in the wind is dominated by the free-free opacity so that the inner radius increases with wavelength, as is realized in some massive winds like those of the Wolf-Rayet stars. The line emission in the wind occurs exterior to the continuum photosphere, hence lines observed at different wavelengths probe different regions of the wind acceleration. A major consequence of these physical conditions is the opportunity to infer v(r), even if non-monotonic. Numerical examples are given to test the method, in which smooth and non-smooth monotonic v(r), non-monotonic v(r), and the effects of noise are addressed. In the absence of noise, the inversion of the simulated data for radius r(λ) and expansion velocity v(λ) is excellent. Even with noise at the 15% level, the recovery for r(λ) remains reasonably robust, though the results for v(λ) are more strongly affected. Although more sophisticated techniques are required to infer v(λ) from noisy data, the simpler considerations presented here provide a basic theoretical framework for applying the inversion and indicate the potential of the method for deriving the wind flow structure.","Line: profiles; Stars: early-type; Stars: mass-loss; Stars: Wolf-Rayet",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0142206648

Inako-dake, Yatsugatake Range, central Japan, where an interesting vertical structure of vegetation is observed. Here, alpine plants (Pinus pumila community) are located at the bottom (ca. 2300 m a.s.l.) and a subalpine forest is formed above them (so-called vegetation inversion). An observational study was made of the frequency, intensity, and duration of the cold air lake during the warm season in order to reveal the climate environment related to the vertical structure of vegetation. Air temperature observations were carried out along the east-west section crossing the hollow from June 28 to November 7, 1995. A cold air lake was defined as that which has the maximum difference (referred to as 'maximum inversion' in this study) exceeding 2°C in night temperature between the summit of Mt. Inako-dake (the highest point; 2380 m) and the bottom of the hollow (the lowest point; 2230 m). Seventy-eight days were identified as having cold air lake formation. Cold air lake formation was substantially influenced by synoptic-scale pressure patterns. Cold air lakes were manifested when this area was under the influence of the North Pacific anticyclone during summer and the migratory anticyclone during autumn. Under the migratory high during autumn, the maximum inversion reached 19.5°C (October 13). Based on the synoptic pressure patterns, we categorized cold air lakes into two types: summer and autumn types that are formed under the North Pacific high and the migratory high, respectively. The summer and autumn types were identified for 19 days and 31 days, respectively. These types have respective average maximum inversions of 6.1°C and 8.7°C, and average periods of cold air lake formation of 6.3 hours and 8.7 hours, respectively. The cold air lakes of the summer type developed after midnight (23 h to 1 h), whereas those of the autumn type were formed earlier in the early evening (16 h) and maintained until morning (9 h). The radiative cooling that causes the cold air lakes of the summer type was likely weakened due to the increased downard long-wave radiation from clouds that persist until midnight and/or moist air. On the other hand, the dry air mass under the migratory high strengthened radiative cooling overnight for the autumn type.",,"atmospheric pressure; cold air; Honshu; Japan; Mount Inakodake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031739187

We examined a range of tracking policies, designed to tackle climatic variation, using a simulation model of a semi-arid grazing system. These compared annual sales designed to limit stocking rate, pre-emptive sales triggered by insufficient rainfall, and variable sales and stocking rate regimes determined by the current season's rainfall. Although the flexible stocking strategies did reduce mortality losses, compared with fixed stocking, they did not increase average annual sales. The main reasons for this are that major losses of stock are associated less with 1-year than with 2-year droughts, which are difficult to track, and that destocking can be really effective only if the productive potential of the herd can be re-established more rapidly than is possible from depleted herd resources. Tracking policies did have a considerable advantage in terms of reduced inter-annual variability of sales, which would be of economic benefit to the commercial livestock sector. For subsistence pastoralists, the traditional policies of maintaining the maximum number of breeding stock, and of hoping that most of them will survive drought, may be as close as 'opportunistic' management can get to dealing with drought.",,"drought; grazing; semiarid region; water management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032122978

Both eCG and oFSH significantly increased the ovarian carbonyl reductase concentration 48 h after treatment compared with the saline-treated group, but the increase with eCG was approximately twice that with oFSH. Seventy-two hours after treatment, eCG further increased both carbonyl reductase activity and its concentration. Ovulation was also induced. oFSH stimulated only ovarian follicular growth without further increase in either activity or concentration. In addition, eCG increased the immunoreactivity to anti-carbonyl reductase antibody in the theca and interstitial cells, but oFSH did not. Treatment with hCG in saline-pretreated rats increased carbonyl reductase activity by 2.8-fold and carbonyl reductase concentration by 4.1-fold after 9 h compared with the 0 h concentration, without producing the large follicles observed with eCG and oFSH. However, the stimulatory effect of hCG on ovarian carbonyl reductase in eCG- or oFSH-pretreated rats was weaker than that in saline-pretreated rats.

These oxygenates are used as substitutes for the poisonous tetraethyl lead. The ASTM D-4815 method utilizes a GC method for determining methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutanol (2-methyl-1-propanol), tert-butanol (2-methyl-2-propanol) and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) in gasoline. However, since this method requires a variety of column switching and back-flushing systems, the possibility of using a simple and fast mid-IR transmission method for accomplishing the same task was pursued. For this, an instrument manufacturer's software that utilizes a partial least square (PLS) regression analysis in the region of importance for alcohols and ethers (1300 to 810 cm-1) was chosen and successfully developed. A set of fuel blend samples (32) that contained concentrations in the range of 0.7 to 4.0 (wt/vol) of the components were used for calibration purposes. Results indicated that the correlation (R2) between the actual and predicted values of 70 laboratory prepared samples of concentrations in the range 0.7 to 8.1% (wt/vol) were 0.995, 0.995, 0.991, 0.992, 0.983, 0.995, 0.989, 0.984 and 0.996 for methanol, ethanol, 1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, isobutanol, tert-butanol and MTBE respectively. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The hepatic glutathione S-transferase (GST)-dependent enzyme activities in the crab hepatopancreas were also measured to examine their potential as biomarkers for the contaminants. Crabs from the Tone River, which runs through industrial, agricultural, and urban areas, have the highest concentrations of HAHs (4,100 pg/g fat weight), followed by those from the Barato River (2,430-2,970 pg/g fat weight), whereas crabs from the Shiribetsu River were relatively less contaminated (1,350-1,800 pg/g fat weight). Identification of numerous PCDD and PCDF congeners in crabs from all three rivers provided evidence that one of the major sources of PCDDs and PCDFs was waste incineration. In addition, crabs from the Barato and Shiribetsu Rivers were notably contaminated with 1,3,6,8- and 1,3,7,9-TeCDD congeners, which suggests that a possible source was chlornitrofen, which has been extensively used in paddy fields as herbicide. Calculation of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin toxic equivalents (TEQs) showed that the causal contaminants of higher TEQs in crabs from the Tone River (94.7 TEQ picograms per gram fat weight) were PCDDs and PCDFs, although the most important contributor to the total TEQs was coplanar PCBs (49.95%). The crab hepatopancreas appeared to have abilities to transfer glutathione to 1-chloro-2,4-nitrobenzene (CDNB) and 3,4-dichloronitrobenzene (DCNB). The crabs with the highest TEQ levels showed the highest GST activities. The current results and our previous data lead us to conclude that cytochrome P450 and GST-dependent enzyme activities (benzo[a]pyrene hydroxylation and CDNB and DCNB conjugation) in freshwater crab hepatopancreases are likely to be useful biomarkers for the contamination of planar aromatic hydrocarbons such as benzo[a]pyrene, PCDDs, PCDFs, and coplanar PCBs.","Coplanar polychlorinated biphenyls; Crab; Dibenzofurans; Glutathione S-transferase; Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins","1 chloro 2,4 dinitrobenzene; 1,2 dichloro 4 nitrobenzene; aromatic hydrocarbon; benzo[a]pyrene; biological marker; chlornitrofen; cytochrome p450; dibenzofuran derivative; fresh water; glutathione transferase; halogenated hydrocarbon; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; animal tissue; article; chemical waste; crab; enzyme activity; female; japan; liver; male; nonhuman; pest control; priority journal; water contamination; water quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031877068

K2G5X2, Canada","The primary donor, P, of photosynthetic bacterial reaction centers (RCs) is a dimer of excitonically interacting bacteriochlorophyll (BChl) molecules. The two constituents are named P(L) and P(M) to designate their close association with the L- and M-subunits, respectively, of the RC protein. A series of site-directed mutants of RCs from Rhodobacter sphaeroides has been constructed in order to model the effects of hydrogen bonding on the redox midpoint potential and electronic structure of P. The leucine residue at position M160 was genetically replaced with eight other amino acid residues capable of donating a hydrogen bond to the C9 keto carbonyl group of the P(M) BChl a molecule of P. Fourier transform (FT) (pre)resonance Raman spectroscopy with 1064 nm excitation was used to (i) determine the formation and strengths of hydrogen bonds on this latter keto carbonyl group in the reduced, neutral state (P(o)), and (ii) determine the degree of localization of the positive charge on one of the two constituent BChl molecules of P in its oxidized, radical cation state (P·+). A correlation was observed between the strength of the hydrogen bond and the increase in Po/P·+ redox midpoint potential. This correlation is less pronounced than that observed for another series of RC mutants where hydrogen bonds to the four π- conjugated carbonyl groups of P were broken or formed uniquely involving histidinyl residues [Mattioli, T. A., Lin, X., Allen, J.P. and Williams, J. C. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 6142-6152], indicating that histidinyl residues are more effective in raising the P(o)/P·+ redox midpoint potential via hydrogen bond formation than are other hydrogen bond-forming residues. In addition, an increase in positive charge localization is correlated with the strength of the hydrogen bond and with the Po/P·+ redox midpoint potential. This latter correlation was analyzed using an asymmetric bacteriochlorophyll dimer model based on Huckel-type molecular orbitals in order to obtain estimates of certain energetic parameters of the primary donor. Based on this model, the correlation is extrapolated to the case of complete localization of the positive charge on P(L) and gives a predicted value for the P/P+ redox midpoint potential similar to that experimentally determined for the Rb. sphaeroides HL(M202) heterodimer. The model yields parameters for the highest occupied molecular orbital energies of the two BChl a constituents of P which are typical for the oxidation potential of isolated BChl a in vitro, suggesting that the protein, as compared to many solvents, does not impart atypical redox properties to the BChl a constituents of P.",,"bacteriochlorophyll; article; electron transport; Fourier transformation; hydrogen bond; model; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; photosynthesis; priority journal; Raman spectrometry; Rhodobacter sphaeroides; Amino Acid Substitution; Binding Sites; Electron Transport; Electrons; Electrostatics; Fourier Analysis; Hydrogen Bonding; Light-Harvesting Protein Complexes; Models, Molecular; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Oxidation-Reduction; Photosynthetic Reaction Center Complex Proteins; Protein Conformation; Rhodobacter sphaeroides; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria; Rhodobacter sphaeroides; Rhodopseudomonas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032566323

Large-scale RNA differential display technology applied to these cell lines identified several differentially expressed genes, including an alpha carbonic anhydrase gene, termed CA12. The deduced protein sequence was classified as a one-pass transmembrane CA possessing an apparently intact catalytic domain in the extracellular CA module. Reintroduced wild-type VHL strongly inhibited the overexpression of the CA12 gene in the parental renal cell carcinoma cell lines. Similar results were obtained with CA9, encoding another transmembrane CA with an intact catalytic domain. Although both domains of the VHL protein contribute to regulation of CA12 expression, the elongin binding domain alone could effectively regulate CA9 expression. We mapped CA12 and CA9 loci to chromosome bands 15q22 and 17q21.2 respectively, regions prone to amplification in some human cancers. Additional experiments are needed to define the role of CA IX and CA XH enzymes in the regulation of pH in the extracellular microenvironment and its potential impact on cancer cell growth.","Carcinogenesis; Differential display; Gene targets","carbonate dehydratase; amino acid sequence; chromosome 15q; chromosome 17q; conference paper; enzyme regulation; fluorescence in situ hybridization; gene locus; human; human cell; kidney carcinoma; molecular cloning; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein domain; protein expression; von Hippel Lindau disease",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032514685

Furthermore, high nitrogen emissions to the marine environment cause eutrophication with increased algal growth, changes in the biological communities and deoxygenation. Both groundwater protection and eutrophication are significant environmental issues on the European agenda. The main source of nitrogen in Europe is agricultural leaching from fields caused by excess inputs of fertilisers and manure compared to harvested output. This is especially evident in North-western Europe. It is reflected in river concentrations of nitrate, which are significantly highest in Western Europe. Since the late 1970s, nitrate concentrations have increased all over Europe reflecting intensification of agriculture. High concentrations occur in groundwater in most parts of Europe and most coastal areas of Europe show signs of eutrophication. In Denmark the Parliament in 1987 decided on the Action Plan on the Aquatic Environment (I), which included measures in several sectors. For agriculture the target was a 49% reduction of nitrogen emissions in order to improve groundwater quality and reduce marine loading. In the early 1990s monitoring results and modelling documented that the measures taken in 1987 as well as additional measures taken were insufficient to reach the target. In late 1997 Action Plan on the Environment (II) was agreed maintaining the target, which shall be reached by a range of measures including restoration of wetlands, afforestation, groundwater protection areas, improved animal fodder utilisation, more stringent requirements on livestock density (harmony criteria), more stringent nitrogen utilisation requirements for animal manure, and reduced nitrogen standards for crops. At the European level, the Nitrates Directive has as objective to reduce nitrate emissions to groundwater and surface water. The fact that no country yet has implemented the Directive, clearly documents the difficulties in taking efficient environmental measures in agriculture. The recent Danish policy measures show that there is no easy and cheap solution, which is also politically acceptable. Therefore a wide range of measures are needed to reduce a significant European environmental problem.","Eutrophication; Inland waters; Marine waters; Nitrogen enrichment; Policy","fertilizer; ground water; nitrate; nitrogen; sea water; groundwater; nitrate; nitrogen; pollution policy; surface water; water pollution; agriculture; conference paper; Denmark; Europe; eutrophication; leaching; manure; nitrogen balance; policy; river; water quality; Europe; algae; Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032438137

In order to elucidate the mechanism underlying the resistance to such high CO2 levels, we compared the changes in excitation energy distribution between photosystem I (PS I) and photosystem II (PS II) by 77 K fluorescence in cells of the high CO2-resistant C. littorale and the non-resistant Stichococcus bacillaris. Immediately after the cells are transferred from air to 40% CO2, the F714/F687 ratio derived from 77 K fluorescence increases in C. littorale cells, suggesting an increase of transition from state 1 to state 2. During this period, more than 80% of plastoquinone A is in the reduced form and the activity of PS I increases. Eventually the F714/F687 ratio, the concentration of reduced plastoquinone A and PS I activity decrease. However, no significant increase of the F714/F687 ratio is observed after the transfer of S.bacillaris cells from air to 40% CO2. The level of reduced plastoquinone A in S. bacillaris gradually increases and the activity of PS I does not show a large change. During the transient period, the level of the D1 protein is approximately constant in C. littorale cells, but is lowered in S. bacillaris. These results suggest that, under extremely high-CO2 conditions, PS II is protected from photoinhibition by control of the state transition in C. littorale cells, whereas such a protection mechanism does not function in the alga S. bacillaris, non-resistant to CO2.","Chlorococcum littorale; Chlorophyll fluorescence; CO2 concentration; Photoinhibition; Photosystem I; Photosystem II; Plastoquinone A; Quantum yield; State transition","carbon dioxide; plastoquinone; article; fluorescence; green alga; nonhuman; photosystem i; photosystem ii; priority journal; Chlorococcum littorale; Stichococcus bacillaris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032584491

At ≤550°C, CH4 reacted with Si only at the surface without apparent diffusion, and the 4-fold periodic structure toward the [0 0 1] azimuth was formed on the surface. At 600°C, with increasing exposure time, the 4-fold periodic structure was initially formed and then disappeared and the diffraction spots of SiC appeared, which indicates substantial diffusion of the reacted C atom into Si.

The approach implies that terminal electron-accepting processes (TEAP) occur at negative ΔGr values near the thermodynamic equilibrium, and that the fermentative H2 production is overall rate limiting. ΔGr values of TEAPs were calculated, assuming partial equilibrium, using H2 concentrations and redox process reactants and products from the Grindsted Landfill. Combined with a threshold value, the calculated values predict which TEAPs can occur via H2 oxidation.Empirical H2 concentration ranges are currently related to specific redox processes, assuming steady-state conditions at which only one microbiologically mediated redox process occurs due to competetive exclusion of others. Here the first H2 data from a landfill leachate plume are presented, end an alternative partial equilibrium approach is used. The approach implies that TEAPs (terminal electron-accepting processes) occur at negative ΔG(r) values, close to thermodynamic equilibrium, and that the fermentative H2 production is overall rate limiting. It eliminates the steady-state prerequisite and may explain the occurrence of concomitant TEAPs. Concentrations of H2 and redox process reactants and products were measured in 52 sampling points, downgradient of the Grindsted Landfill (Denmark), and used to calculate in situ ΔG(r) values of TEAPs, assuming partial equilibrium. H2 generally ranged from 0.004 to 0.88 nM, with most values around 0.2 nM. Fe reduction was, according to the empirically defined ranges, the most prominent TEAP, but concomitant methanogenesis and sulfate reduction occurred as well. This indicated a need for an alternative approach to explaining the H2 distribution, and the measured H2 concentrations are viewed as being controlled by a partial equilibrium. A derived theoretical relation between H2 concentrations and temperature indicates temperature effects to be more important than currently appreciated. Calculated in situ ΔG(r) values can, combined with a threshold value, predict which TEAPs can occur via H2 oxidation. For our samples, ΔG(r) for methanogenesis was always &gt;-7 kJ/mol, and CO2 reduction should only occur in stagnant porewater at higher H2 concentrations or by direct interspecies transfer. In contrast, sulfate and Fe reduction occur close to or slightly below a threshold of -7 kJ/mol H2 and may occur concomitantly at partial equilibrium.",,"Carbon dioxide; Charge transfer; Fermentation; Gibbs free energy; Hydrogen; Iron; Oxidation; Redox reactions; Reduction; Sulfur compounds; Thermal effects; Thermodynamics; Landfill leachate plume; Methanogenesis; Thermodynamic equilibrium; Leachate treatment; landfill; leachate; redox process; article; biodegradation; electron transport; energy transfer; landfill; leaching; oxidation reduction reaction; soil treatment; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032528296

India's delegations have had a crucial part in the insertion of statements in the UNFCCC that the largest share of historical and current emissions originates in developed countries and that the emissions of developing countries will have to grow, while those of developed countries will have to be reduced. This paper is a policy-making analysis of actors, structures, ideas, interests and powers behind the Indian government's national position on climate change. To this objective interviews and informal talks with a number of Indian high-level federal officers as well as a wide range of researchers, politicians and environmental activists have been carried out through January-March 1997. Four striking features prevail from the investigation of policy-making on climate change in India. First, that domestic experts and activists have had a significant influence in shaping the contours of the national position. Second, that energy concerns remain the main driving force. Third, that the Indian government has been reactive rather than proactive in its policy-making. Fourth, that the Indian research agenda on climate change appears considerably directed by foreign rather than domestic priorities. Fragile domestic research in combination with a rather sparse debate among major domestic stakeholders leaves the contours of the Indian national position to be, by and large, externally determined. This is primarily illustrated by the mainly reactive rather than proactive policy-making of the Indian government when it comes to climate change. The Indian position is mainly a reaction to the agenda of the North. It is furthermore constructed from a domestic scientific community which in its climate-related research caters mainly to foreign concerns. A lack of domestic debate on climate change, the ad-hoc style in the Indian bureaucracy's preparations and its tendency to rely heavily on a domestic scientific community which caters primarily to foreign concerns leaves the Indian government poorly prepared for creating a bargaining room for its national interest. India is left merely to respond to the agendas on climate change of politicians, researchers and industrial interests of the North.","Climate; Environmental degradation; Environmental policy; India; International agreements; National policy; Pollution","climate change; environmental policy; institutional framework; policy making; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032468483

For this reason radiation doses from sources throughout the Netherlands have been analyzed. For sources with well-defined locations and doses that were thought to vary significantly throughout the Netherlands, radiation dose maps were produced. Average dose values were calculated or derived from the literature for doses considered to be evenly distributed throughout the country or for which no information on the geographical distribution of dose was available. Emission, dispersion, and individual dose were modeled for each source using various pathways and exposure routes. Indoor radon and gamma radiation from building materials generate the highest dose values. The highest human induced radiation doses for industries of which the doses showed to be geographically distributed are found in the cement industry, elemental phosphorus production, phosphoric acid production, and iron and steel production. Radiation dose from some of these sources has a very local peak and decreases rapidly with distance. The elemental phosphorus production causes relatively high radiation doses throughout a large part of the Netherlands. Cumulation of doses from various sources occurs, but these are often masked by doses from a few large industries.","Dose assessment; Dose, population; Radioactivity; Risk analysis","carbon; carbon 14; lead 210; phosphorus; polonium; radon; uranium 238; article; environmental exposure; environmental radioactivity; gamma radiation; geographic distribution; human; industrial waste; Netherlands; nuclear power plant; population risk; priority journal; radiation dose; radiation exposure; risk assessment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031966044

Any causal explanation of the health effects of air pollutants must go through exposure, yet no large, population based air pollution exposure studies have been conducted in Europe, and consequently no European database of air pollution exposures of urban populations has existed until now. EXPOLIS is a European multicenter study for measurement of air pollution exposures of working age urban population during workdays. The selected urban areas are Athens, Basel, Grenoble, Helsinki, Milan and Prague. The main objectives of EXPOLIS are: - To assess the exposures of European urban populations to major air pollutants. - To analyse the personal and environmental determinants and interrelationships to these exposures. - To develop an European database for simulation of air pollution exposures. These objectives were pursued by measuring the personal exposures, home indoor and outdoor and workplace levels of particles smaller than 2.5 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2.5), volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and carbon monoxide (CO) of approximately 500 subjects representing the adult population of the selected cities. The field work continued from fall of 1996 to winter of 1997-1998. Identical sampling equipment, operating procedures, time-microenvironment-activity diaries, questionnaires, database and data entry tools were used in each center. To assure comparability of the data from the 6 cities in 6 countries, a strict quality assurance/quality control (QA/QC) protocol was established and the field work was supervised by the QA Unit of KTL. Standard operating procedures SOPs were prepared for all subject, laboratory and field procedures, and the EXPOLIS field teams were trained in three joint workshops. VOC laboratory analyses were intercalibrated by the European Commission/Joint Research Centre (EC/JRC) Environment Institute in Ispra. Other techniques were intercalibrated between the teams. This paper describes the main design features of the European Union 4th Framework RTD Programme funded multicenter study; Air Pollution Exposure Distributions of Adult Urban Populations in Europe (EXPOLIS). The EXPOLIS Centers are KTL-(coordinating center) in Helsinki, University of Athens, University of Basel, University Joseph Fourier in Grenoble, University of Milan, Regional Institute of Hygiene of Central Bohemia in Prague, VTT (Finnish State Technical Research Center) in Helsinki, and RIVM (Dutch National Public Health Institute) in Bilthoven.

The pilot consists of nine inverted (injector-centered) 5-spot patterns covering approximately 320 acres and is located in a mature area of the field where the majority of the wells had been plugged due to high water cuts. The pilot location was selected based on geology and reservoir performance during waterflood. A CO2 pilot was chosen, rather than full-field implementation, to investigate uncertainties associated with the CO2 target oil saturation, the feasibility of re-entering abandoned wellbores, and overall CO2 flood performance. CO2 injection in the pilot commenced in December of 1996. The project benefited from available technology on CO2 flooding and particularly from information on other San Andres CO2 floods. The paper summarizes the methods used in the early project evaluation/design, data acquisition programs, reservoir simulation and CO2 flood predictions, and project implementation. The reservoir management plan, actual performance to date, and future potential are also discussed. The process used (methodology and technical analysis) to evaluate and design the GSAU CO2 pilot are applicable to other potential Permian Basin CO2 floods. © Copyright 1998, Society of Petroleum Engineers, Inc.",,"Carbon dioxide; Data acquisition; Floods; Oil wells; Project management; Reservoir management; Reservoirs (water); Enhanced recovery; Oil bearing formations; Oil field development; Oil fields; Oil well production; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Well flooding; Acquisition programs; Field implementation; Flood prediction; Project evaluation; Project implementation; Reservoir performance; Reservoir simulation; Technical analysis; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Unit operations (oil wells); Goldsmith San Andres unit; Oil water contact; Reservoir management plan",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031619667

Many anthropogenically acidified lakes presently occur in that part of eastern Canada where SO42- deposition is elevated. Terrain sensitivity also influences their spatial distribution. From 1981 to 1994, only 33% of 202 lakes monitored across eastern Canada showed a statistically significant improvement (reduction) in acidity in response to reduced SO42- deposition (11% had increasing acidity and 56% showed no change). Over half of the improving lakes are near Sudbury, Ontario. Several biogeochemical processes are delaying de-acidification. As a result, there has been little biological recovery in eastern waters, except near Sudbury. Steady-state water chemistry modelling suggests that the proportion of ""damaged"" lakes (defined as having pH &lt; 6) will decline in response to both the Canadian and US emission controls. Reductions in biological damage (e.g. fewer lost fish populations) are expected also, but they will lag behind chemical improvement. Significant damage to aquatic ecosystems will remain after all chemical and biological improvements are realized. Further controls will be needed to protect sensitive ecosystems.","Acid rain; Aquatic effects; Assessment; Emission control; Modelling; Trends",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031653018

Stringent mass and power constraints, together with a greater than two year mission life, led to the selection of a TRW miniature pulse tube refrigerator to cool SABER's infrared detectors to the required temperature of 75 K. This paper provides an overview of the SABER thermal management plan and the challenges encountered in matching the refrigerator characteristics with instrument performance requirements under the broadly variant space environments expected for this mission. Innovative technologies were developed to keep heat loads within the limited cooling capacity of the miniature refrigerator, as well as mechanically isolating but thermally connecting the refrigerator cold block to the focal plane assembly (FPA). A passive radiator will maintain the SABER telescope at an average temperature of 230 K while a separate radiator will reject heat from the refrigerator and electronics at approximately 260 K. Significant breadboard tests of various components of the SABER instrument have taken place and the details of one of these will be discussed. The test included attaching a miniature mechanical refrigerator, borrowed from the Air Force, to the SABER FPA. This opportunity gave the SABER team a significant head start in learning about integrating and testing issues related with the TRW miniature pulse tube refrigerator. SABER is scheduled to be launched in January 2000 as the primary instrument of NASA's TIMED (Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics) spacecraft. The TIMED program is being managed by the Applied Physics Laboratory at Johns Hopkins University.","FiST; Infrared telescope; SABER; TIMED; TRW miniature pulse tube refrigerator","Cooling; Infrared detectors; Light emission; Radiators; Refrigerators; Space research; Space telescopes; Thermal load; Miniature pulse tube refrigerators; Radiometry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032401429

Box 808 L 103, Livermore, CA 94550, United States","It is our opinion that over the past 20 years, some atmospheric scientists have used a scientifically incorrect method for finding the contribution of methane to changes in ozone. In any volume element of the atmosphere, the differential equation for ozone D is equal to gross production P minus gross loss L plus transport, which may be written D = P(methane) - L(methane) + P(not methane) - L (not methane) + transport. If both P(not methane) and L (not methane) are effectively zero, then the full differential equation is equal to the differential equation for the effect of methane, D (total) = P(methane) - L(methane) + transport. An approach was introduced around 1980 that has been widely used since then, with the valid assumption that in the lower troposphere the methane smog reactions are the only source of gross ozone production, P(methane). It concluded that the differential rate equation for total ozone change in such regions gives the net ozone change by the methane process (DE method). However, in the lowest troposphere, there are processes not caused by methane that destroy ozone at all altitudes (notably O1D + H2O = 2OH), so that L (not methane) is not zero, and thus D = P(methane) - L(methane) - L(not methane) + transport, making the DE method conceptually wrong everywhere. The object of this paper is to solve for how methane changes ozone in the troposphere and stratosphere. Crutzen [1973] gave the first treatment of ozone formation in the global troposphere via methane photooxidation. He considered radical attack on methane to produce CH3 followed by three reaction sequences that go from CH3 to CO2, referred to here as the sequence (SEQ) method. The present study substantially extends Crutzen's sequence method: There are five significant branching points as methane is consumed and 34 sequences (different reaction paths) between CH4 and CO, and more reactions lead to CO2. A detailed derivation is given here, branching ratios are evaluated, and the results are presented as two complicated, closed, algebraic equations, which are valid from the surface up to the middle stratosphere. The SEQ method contains only ozone changes caused by the presence of methane. This method is implemented with output from the 1997 version of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory two-dimensional model. Assuming we carried out the SEQ method correctly, we find the DE method to be a fairly good numerical approximation in some areas and a poor numerical approximation in other areas. Averaged over the troposphere, the net effect of the methane smog process is to destroy OH at a rate 32% as fast as it is formed by the nonmethane process, O1D + H2O = 2OH. The integral over the global troposphere finds that the net rate of ozone production from methane by the DE is 2.2-fold slower than the SEQ method.

Saturation monitors are non-reference or non-equivalent sampling methods for measuring particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), and nitrogen oxides (NOx). The samplers are small, portable, and relatively easy to set up and operate. Because of their relatively low cost and ease of operation, it is customary to 'saturate' a geographical area with the samplers to assess the air quality in areas where high concentrations of pollutants are possible. The data collected are helpful to control agencies in evaluating their ambient air monitoring networks for consistency with the 40 CFR Part 58 air quality surveillance regulations. The SMR, which was established by EPA in 1993, includes a supply of saturation samplers and support equipment which agencies may borrow to conduct special field studies. The SMR also provides limited services to quality assure the samplers and assist in field studies upon request. Occasionally, State, local, and tribal agencies measure concentrations of particulate matter that exceed or are close to exceeding the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for PM10 and/or PM2.5. In order to understand the nature of the particulate matter contributing to the high concentrations, EPA provides filter analysis service as part of the SMR to agencies requesting such assistance.",,"Carbon monoxide; Monitoring; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Regulatory compliance; Standards; Air monitoring networks; Saturation monitor repository; Air quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032273978

We initiated a long-term experiment in 1994 in moist tussock and dry heath tundra in arctic Alaska in which we increased summer air temperature (ca. 2°C) and increased winter snow accumulation (shortening the growing season approximately 4 wk). During the 1996 snow-free season, we measured ecosystem CO2 flux weekly in order to quantify net carbon gain or loss from these systems. Over the duration of the snow-free season, both dry heath and moist tussock tundra exhibited a net loss of carbon to the atmosphere, ranging from 12 to 81 g C m-2 depending upon experimental treatment. Elevated summer temperatures accelerated net CO2 loss rates over ambient temperatures in both deep and ambient snow treatments, and increased the total amount of carbon emitted during the snow-free season by 26 to 38% in ambient snow plots and by 112 to 326% in deep snow plots. Increased snow accumulation had less impact on CO2 flux than did warming, and snow effects on total carbon loss were not consistent between the two temperature regimes. Ecosystem respiration exceeded assimilation on most sampling dates throughout the season. These data, coupled with winter carbon losses recently demonstrated in the same ecosystems, indicate that the moist and dry arctic ecosystems we examined are currently net sources of atmospheric carbon on an annual basis, and that anticipated global warming may increase carbon losses from these systems.",,"arctic environment; carbon dioxide; environmental change; seasonality; soil emission; tundra; Alaska; Arctic; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032435193

At a certain fuel inlet velocity, the measurements indicate that the flame exhibits local extinction at 20 diameters from the fuel nozzle and subsequent downstream relighting. The objective was to investigate whether the current pdf approach can treat extinction/reignition phenomena and accurately predict the concentrations of species such as CO and H2. Two different mixing models - coalescence- dispersion and linear mean square estimation (LMSE) - were tested, together with two turbulence models (κ-ε and full Reynolds stress). The solution method involved a coupled finite-volume solution of the velocity field and a Monte Carlo simulation of the pdf transport equation. A global hydrocarbon scheme (no radical species present) was employed to represent the chemistry. The predictions demonstrated that in general the mixing and fuel consumption rates were well represented. Other scalars such as H2O and temperature were also satisfactorily predicted for the flame not subjected to local extinction; furthermore, in this particular case, the results obtained were very similar regardless of the mixing models and turbulence closures applied. However, with regard to the intermediate species, H2 and CO, some overprediction was observed. For the flame where extinction was observed experimentally, the predictions showed that with LMSE, extinction with no subsequent relighting was predicted whereas with the coalescence-dispersion model stable burning was reproduced though the low temperatures observed at x/D = 20 were not predicted. In addition the results were sensitive to the predicted spreading rate and hence to the turbulence model.",,"Air; Dispersions; Forecasting; Fuels; Intelligent systems; Mixing; Monte Carlo methods; Probability density function; Reynolds number; Salinity measurement; Turbulence models; Velocity; Dispersion modeling; Finite volume solution; Finite-rate chemistry; Fuel consumption rates; Intermediate specie; Mean square estimation; Probability density function (pdf); Turbulent nonpremixed jet flames; Fighter aircraft; flame; jet; probability density; Turbulence; aircraft; airflow; article; aviation; combustion; priority journal; turbulent flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031778364

The effects of interspecific competition on plant responses to CO2 enrichment were investigated by growing the species in a four-species mixture. The results indicate that the species differ in their ability to respond to elevated CO2. CO2-enrichment had the largest effect on the biomass production of H. lanatus, but substantial stimulations in biomass production were also found for the other three species. The CO2-stimulation of biomass production for H. lanatus was accompanied by increased tillering. In addition, reductions in specific leaf area were found for all species. Exposure to elevated CO2 increased the community biomass of the four-species mixture. This increase can be mainly attributed to a significant increase in the biomass of H. lanatus at elevated CO2. No statistically-significant changes in species composition of community biomass were found. However, H. lanatus did increase its share of community biomass at each of the harvests, with the other three species, mainly L. perenne, suffering losses in their shares at elevated CO2. The results show that: (1) the species varied in their response to elevated CO2; and (2) species composition in natural plant communities is likely to change at elevated CO2, but these changes may occur rather slowly. Much longer periods of exposure to elevated atmospheric CO2 may be required to permit detection of significant changes in species composition.","Agrostis capillaris; Biomass; Carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment; Competition; Cynosurus cristatus; Holcus lanatus; Lolium perenne; Specific leaf area; Tillering","Agrostis; Agrostis capillaris; Agrostis capillaris; Cynosurus cristatus; Cynosurus cristatus; Holcus lanatus; Holcus lanatus; Lolium perenne; Lolium perenne; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031856620

Pointwise, the material is characterized as a linear elastic orthotropic material. The in-plane orientation of the carbon fibers is systematically varied as a function of depth. The influence of fiber orientation as a function of depth on the indentation response is considered along with the relationship between the indenter force vs depth. The fiber orientation profiles considered are those of a continuous linear variation between 90° at the outer surfaces and 0° at the center plane of the laminate, and a cross ply laminate involving alternating 90° and 0° layers through thickness. Experimentally, it is found that for the case of a cross-ply laminate, the indentation produces delaminations localized at the interfaces that separate planes of dissimilar orientation. For this case, stress concentrations at interfaces between plies of dissimilar orientation coincide with the observed sites of delamination. For the graded case, evidence of enhanced nonlinear deformation is found, without the nucleation of cracks. Computations show that for the graded material, tensile stresses perpendicular to fibers are suppressed significantly, possibly explaining the absence of matrix cracks in this material. Measured and computed indenter force-depth variations were found to be in good agreement. Experiments and computations also reveal that the orientation-graded material is more compliant when subjected to indentation than the conventional cross-ply laminate. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The resulting biofilter was fed with air contaminated with toluene, xylene or a mixture of toluene and xylene. The maximum elimination capacities attained were 165 g m-3 h-1 for toluene, 66 g m-3 h-1 for xylene and 115 g m-3 h-1 for the mixture of toluene and xylene.

For a fixed total number of guest molecules, the ratio of xenon to methane is varied in order to examine the special properties of diffusion in a mixture. High xenon concentrations were found to slow the methane diffusivity in the mixture, while the diffusion of xenon is nearly unaffected by high methane concentrations. The reason for the dominance of xenon is the larger local heat of adsorption of xenon and the larger mass of xenon compared to methane in combination with channel size and topology in silicalite. Simulated and experimental data are in very good agreement with each other.

The positions of the 11 disulfide bridges in HIV-2 gp125 were determined by analogy with the experimental position of the disulfide bonds found in the gp120 of HIV-1. Peptides expected to mimic all 11 disulfide-bonded domains containing from 13 to 47 amino acids were synthesized by the solid-phase method according to 9- fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl strategy, except for peptide 5, which was assembled according to t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) strategy. Analysis of all the crude peptides showed that the expected peptides were obtained with good yields, between 75% and 85%. Peptides were purified further by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) on an Aquapore RPC30 C8 column. Peptide homogeneity was more than 90%. For each peptide, linear peptides (L) were SH- iodoacetamidated, whereas cyclization of peptides (C) was performed by air oxidation. Oxidation kinetics was followed with the Ellman test and HPLC. Cyclic peptides were purified by HPLC and characterized by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry. This analysis showed that a small quantity (<10%) of dimeric peptides (2 and 8) and cyclic peptides containing oxidized methionine or tryptophan residues (4, 9 and 10) were formed. To assess the relevance of conformation for the antigenicity of disulfide-bonded loops of HIV-2 gp125, the antigenicity of linear and cyclic peptides was tested against a set of 76 HIV-2 positive human sera by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Peptides 2, 4 and 9, mimicking the V1, V2 and V3 regions of the external envelope glycoprotein (gp 125) of HIV-2, were the most highly reactive with HIV-2 positive human sera tested at the dilution of 1:50. Cyclic peptides generally were recognized more than linear peptides, as shown by their greater inhibition (2 to 10 times more) of antigen-antibody complexes. Structure-antigenicity of peptide V3, the most reactive peptide (75% of the HIV-2 positive sera tested), was analyzed further. Cyclic peptide 9C had a higher affinity for anti-gp125 antibodies than linear peptide 9L. In addition, circular dichroism showed that linear and cyclic peptides 9 had a similar structure, but when analyzed in aqueous solution or in trifluoroethanol (TFE), the structural difference shown with antibodies was not confirmed. No significant difference was observed between the antigenicity of linear and cyclic peptides 1, 8 and 11, mimicking the C1, C2 and C4 regions of HIV-1 gp125. These peptides were weakly reactive with HIV- 2 positive sera. This result agrees with the low immunogenicity of conserved regions.","Antigenicity; gp125ROD; HIV-2; HIV-2 positive sera; Linear and cyclic peptides","cyclopeptide; antigen expression; antigen recognition; antigenicity; article; Human immunodeficiency virus 2; nonhuman; priority journal; protein purification; virus detection; virus envelope",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031953399

Active filtering may also realize higher efficiency than passive filtering. This paper focuses on an active filter topology that significantly reduces the common mode voltage created by voltage source inverters.

Moist easterly winds sweep in from the Indian Ocean during all seasons except winter, producing a balance between evaporative losses and precipitation. The seasonal cycle is unimodal with a peak of rainfall and temperature in the summer months (December to February) with a 1-2 month lag for streamflow and vegetation growth. Rainfall and temperature departures in recent decades exhibit a 3 year cycle and a 3-6 month persistence of cool/wet or warm/dry phases. The predictability of summer rainfall, temperature, crop yield, inflow to dams and malaria incidence is explored. Multivariate linear regression models with lead-times of one season account for two-thirds of the variance in most cases. Climatic signals which enable predictability include winds over the tropical east Atlantic and north Indian Ocean. El Nino signals from tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures and the Southern Oscillation Index are also important predictors for KwaZulu-Natal's climate. These relationships suggest that local circulation responses to large scale tropical-polar temperature gradients govern climatic fluctuations over KwaZulu-Natal.","Climate signal; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; KwaZulu-Natal; Regional climate; Seasonality; South Africa; Statistical analysis; Weather forecasting","climate signal; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; regional climate; seasonality; statistical analysis; weather forecasting; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032466432

A case study of rice straw production in the Sacramento Valley was conducted, which illustrates that 600 tons/day of straw can be accessed at an estimated net delivered cost of about $20-21/dry ton. Gainfully utilizing this residue can ease the problems of disposal facing agricultural operations in the state. Furthermore, the potential environmental benefits of diverting rice straw from open-field burning will be to significantly reduce criteria air pollutants such as VOC, SOx, NOx, and PM10, and also silica emissions, which are not specifically monitored but can be a health hazard.",,"Air pollution control; Cellulose derivatives; Density (specific gravity); Feedstocks; Harvesting; Moisture; Particulate emissions; Storage (materials); Waste disposal; Waste utilization; Lignocellulose; Straw",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032314888

The approach is particularly suitable for the analysis of museum collections, and it combines the data reduction capabilities of multivariate techniques (ordination and classification) with GIS tools for the manipulation of geographically referenced data. The specific steps of the analysis are (1) construction of a grid coveting the study area at an appropriate resolution, (2) overlaying the grid with a data base of spatially referenced species records, (3) determining the number of times each species was recorded in each cell, (4) constructing a matrix of grid cells by species where each entry indicates the number of records of a particular species in a particular cell, (5) removing cells whose total number of records is lower than some threshold (to be determined) from the matrix, (6) analysis of the reduced matrix using ordination and classification techniques, (7) construction of maps representing the results of the multivariate analyses, and (8) analysis of these maps with respect to digital maps of relevant climatological factors. The applicability of this approach was evaluated by analysing the response of the land snail fauna of Israel to regional variation in mean annual rainfall. As was expected, patterns of faunal variation were significantly correlated with underlying variation in rainfall. However, the per-unit effect of rainfall on the composition of the studied fauna was much greater in dry regions than in more rainy areas. Above 450 mm, no relationships could be detected between the observed patterns of faunal variation and rainfall. These patterns were consistent over a wide range of grid cell sizes (5-20 km), and were robust to outliers. The overall results indicate that the integration of GIS tools with standard multivariate techniques may serve as a valuable methodology for the identification and interpretation of regional patterns of faunal variation.","Cluster analysis; Geographical information systems; Ordination; Species composition","climate; environmental gradient; fauna; GIS; modeling; snail; Gastropoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031784073

The bulk contents of U and Th in fine-grained samples are larger than those of coarse-grained ones, and have positive correlations with the abundance of detrital biotite grains. The total amount of U eluted by the leaching reagents was more than half in all divided samples. In particular, a large amount of U was leached by sodium acetate/acetic acid (pH 5.0), and hydroxylamine hydrochloride/acetic acid solutions. It is inferred that carbonate and iron oxide minerals play an important role in U ore genesis. The adsorption density of fine-grained samples is larger than that of the course-grained one, which suggests that the fine U minerals are abundant in fine-grained sample and/or the U concentration around the complexing site of iron oxyhydroxides may have become high. The bulk 234U/238U activity ratio is 0.95 ± 0.05, and the bulk 230Th/234U activity ratio is 1.36 ± 0.06. For most of the sieved samples, 234U/238U activity ratios are &lt;1, and 230Th/234U activity ratios are &gt;1, showing that U is partially removed from the sediments. The uranium nuclides in the matrix of conglomerate are inferred to be not in equilibrium within 300,000 y. The ion exchangeable U, whose 234U/238U activity ratio was &gt;1, is bound weakly and exchangeable with U in the surrounding water such as interstitial water and groundwater with 234U/238U activity ratios &gt;1. The 234U/238U activity ratios of the residue fraction are less than 1 (finer sample) or more than 1 (coarser sample), indicating that the recoil ejection effect of U is advantageous for the fine-grained samples while injection effect is advantageous for the coarse-grained samples. The 234U/238U activity ratios of other fractions are less than 1, which is quite similar to the bulk ratio. The ratio decreases in the order of carbonate &gt; iron oxide &gt; organic/sulfide fractions. The 230Th/234U activity ratios is very low in ion exchangeable fraction and &gt;1 in carbonate, iron oxide, and residue fractions. For the residue fraction, 234U/238U &gt; 1 and 230Th/234U &gt; 1 indicate the elution of U and enrichment of 234U relative to 238U by alpha recoil injection. The organic/sulfide complex fraction is depleted in 230Th compared to 238U and 234U. This fact suggests that U was secondarily enriched over Th. As U was enriched at the surface of pyrites, it is inferred that pyrites adsorbed a portion of the eluted U and helped the secondary fixation of U in modern times.",,"conglomerate; geochemistry; granite; ore deposit; radionuclide migration; thorium; uranium; Honshu; Japan; Tono Mine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032462477

The model communities consisted of four plant species (Cardamine hirsuta, Poa annua. Senecio vulgaris, Spergula arvensis), four herbivorous insect species (two aphids, a leaf-miner, and a whitefly) and their parasitoids, snails, earthworms, woodlice, soil-dwelling Collembola (springtails), nematodes and soil microorganisms (bacteria, fungi, mycorrhizae and Protista). In two successive experiments, the effects of elevated temperature (ambient plus 2 °C) at both ambient and elevated CO2 conditions (ambient plus 200 ppm) were investigated. A 40:60 sand:Surrey loam mixture with relatively low nutrient levels was used. Each experiment ran for 9 months and soil microbial biomass (C(mic) and N(mic)), soil microbial community (fungal and bacterial phospholipid fatty acids), basal respiration, and enzymes involved in the carbon cycling (xylanase, trehalase) were measured at depths of 0-2, 0-10 and 10-20 cm. In addition, root biomass and tissue C:N ratio were determined to provide information on the amount and quality of substrates for microbial growth. Elevated temperature under both ambient and elevated CO2 did not show consistent treatment effects. Elevation of air temperature at ambient CO2 induced an increase in C(mic) of the 0-10 cm layer, while at elevated CO2 total phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) increased after the third generation. The metabolic quotient qCO2 decreased at elevated temperature in the ambient CO2 run. Xylanase and trehalase showed no changes in both runs. Root biomass and C:N ratio were not influenced by elevated temperature in ambient CO2. In elevated CO2, however, elevated temperature reduced root biomass in the 0-10 cm and 30-40 cm layers and increased N content of roots in the deeper layers. The different response of root biomass and C:N ratio to elevated temperature may be caused by differences in the dynamics of root decomposition and/or in allocation patterns to coarse or fine roots (i.e. storage vs. resource capture functions). Overall, our data suggests that in soils of low nutrient availability, the effects of climate change on the soil microbial community and processes are likely to be minimal and largely unpredicatable.","Climate change; Ecotron; Microbial biomass; Microbial community structure; Soil enzymes; Temperature","carbon dioxide enrichment; community response; ecosystem modeling; root; soil microorganism; temperature effect; Cardamine hirsuta; Poa annua; Senecio vulgaris; Spergula arvensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031692496

As discussed in earlier reports, an intermediate (hmc)CoOOH2+ produced by the first two-electron reduction of (hmc)Co3+ in the presence of O2 was further reduced to (hmc)Co2+ and HOOH. This process appeared as a second cathodic wave and represents a barrier in the overall reduction of O2. In relation to these studies, it was found that the second cathodic reduction was greatly affected by the surface states of the carbon electrode. The reduction potential of the (hmc)CoOOH2+ intermediate when it was adsorbed on a pyrolytic edge plane graphite electrode (EPG) surface was more positive than the corresponding value of the dissolved species measured at a glassy carbon (GC) electrode polished with alumina. It was also shown that the reduction potential shifted in a positive direction when the solution pH was lowered or the surface of the glassy carbon electrode was heavily electro-oxidized. It is proposed that a proton transfer is involved in the electro-reduction of the (hmc)CoOOH2+ complex. The EPG surface which has more surface functional groups has a more acidic environment than the GC electrode and the reduction of (hmc)CoOOH2+ was facilitated. The oxidation of the glassy carbon electrode gives the same effect. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

Several features indicate the pre-existence of evaporites, while alternation of dolomites and evaporites consist a very common association in the subsurface. Brecciation took place in two principal brecciation stages. The first brecciation stage started soon after deposition, during a period of subaerial exposure due to periodic seasonal desiccation and small-scale meteoric removal of intrastratal evaporites. During this stage, the carbonate beds suffered in-situ breakage and carbonate mud infiltrated into fractures. Shortly after, a major brecciation event occurred, that affected the still non-well lithified carbonate fragments, due to progressive dissolution of evaporites by meteoric water. Carbonate mud continues to be infiltrated in-between the breccia fragments. In the same time, intensive calichification processes were responsible for further brecciation and reworking of the brecciated carbonate beds locally sediments, testifying a period of temporary regional emergence (paleosoil). The breccia matrix is characterized by microbreccioid appearance, resulting from internal brecciation of the coarser clasts. Due to early calichification, the matrix becomes enriched in oxidized clays and by pronounched calichification tends to assimilate the breccia clasts, being gradually transformed into a calcrete with floating texture. Clasts microfacies types include phytoclasts with strongly impregnanted by Fe-oxides laminae (laminar calcrete), carbonized plant tissue, lime and dolomitic mudstones with evidence of former evaporites (dolomite/calcite pseudomorphs after gypsum and/or void-filling anhydrite cement, molds after evaporite nodules, euhedral quartz crystals etc.), carbonate fragments pseudomorphic after evaporites, pelsparites/intrasparites, recrystallized dolomites and dedolomites. The predominance of shallow intertidal to supratidal carbonate fragments, indicates that the strata that gave birth to the breccia, formed in a very shallow, restricted, hypersaline, lagoonal setting, evolved into sabkha sequences in the frame of a lowstand episode. Sedimentation of dolomite and evaporite is considered that has taken place during arid periods, while meteoric water influx during the wetter intervals. During that lowstand episode, that resulted in a hiatus interval, the breccias have suffered intensive calichification. Circulating pore-fluid brines resulting from evaporation, provoked syngenetic to early diagenetic dolomitization of muds, by increase of molar Mg/Ca ratio and provided ions for evaporite nodules/crystal growth. Post-Pliocene to Recent subaerial exposure of the carbonate breccias, led to intensive soil-forming processes, active till today, that accentuated the brecciated appearance of the formation. These processes are responsible for the formation of porous carbonate breccias, the so-called 'rauhwackes'.",,"breccia; collapse; dissolution; dolomite; evaporite; sedimentary petrology; Triassic; Greece",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032422590

We describe the cloning of a cDNA which encodes the protein. Immunoblot studies with specific antibodies raised against Cah3 demonstrate that the polypeptide is associated exclusively with the thylakoid membrane. The putative transit peptide suggests that Cah3 is directed to the thylakoid lumen, which is confirmed further by the presence of mature sized Cah3 after thermolysin treatment of intact thylakoids. Complementation of the high inorganic carbon concentration-requiring mutant, cia3, with a subcloned cosmid containing the cah3 gene yielded transformants that grew on atmospheric levels of CO2 (0.035%) and contained an active 29.5 kDa α-type carbonic anhydrase. Although, cia3 has reduced internal carbonic anhydrase activity, unexpectedly the level of Cah3 was similar to that of the wild-type, suggesting that the mutant accumulates an inactive Cah3 polypeptide. Genomic sequence analysis of the mutant revealed two amino acid changes in the transit peptide. Results from photosynthesis and chlorophyll a fluorescence parameter measurements show that the cia3 mutant is photosynthetically impaired.

Results showed that decreasing the nozzle hole diameter was an effective way to reduce the initial injection quantity without increasing black smoke. Compared to a three-way type injector, it was found that a two-way type injector can greatly reduce the amount of fuel leakage from the electromagnetic injector control valve and fuel consumption could be further improved by reduction of the driving loss. Furthermore, the increase of driving losses with higher injection pressure was small, and as a result, higher pressure injection was possible. With the two-way type injector, fuel injection pressure was raised and the nozzle hole diameter was reduced as much as possible, so that reduction of exhaust emissions and improvement of performance in the partial load region was possible without degrading high load or high speed performance.

(1988) would be plausible because the fluctuation pattern of such estimates correlates closely with changes in the accumulation rate of biogenic opal in the sediments. The primary productivity in the West Caroline Basin increased during Stage 2, Stage 3, late Stage 6, Stage 6/7 boundary and Stage 8. At a glance, the results are similar to other studies that have reported higher glacial productivity in low-latitude regions. However, some leads and lags are found between the West Caroline Basin and other areas of the equatorial Pacific and Atlantic. The spectral analysis of MAR(Organic) indicates that the western equatorial Pacific reaches a maximum in MAR(Organic), approximately 7000 years before the maxima in the eastern Pacific. A regional variation of the response of MAR(organic) to the orbital forcing climatic condition suggests that the efficiency of the organic carbon pump may vary with longitude in the equatorial Pacific.","Carbon cycle; Late Pleistocene; Primary productivity; Western equatorial Pacific","biogenic deposit; carbon cycle; marine sediment; paleoceanography; primary production; Quaternary; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032146612

Annual mass flux at the shallow trap at Site 1 was 57.10 g m-2yr-1. Generally, the higher flux of organic matter was associated with higher activities of biogenic opal-producing and carbonate-producing plankton communities. In addition, as the organic matter content increases, the organic carbon/carbonate carbon ratio shows a tendency to increase. Carbonate-producing plankton was predominant during periods 1 and 3 (May to July and November to the beginning of December), which could be due to limited silica supply to the euphotic zone. On the other hand, surface sea water was more nutrient-rich during periods 2 and 4 (August to October and the end of December to April) at Site 1. These high total mass fluxes could be stimulated by wind. The amount of biogenic components collected in the sediment traps and the accumulation in surface sediments at Site l could be compared with primary productivity values. Carbonate and biogenic opal fluxes were 99 % and 90 % less, respectively, in the surface sediments compared to those in the shallow sediment trap. This could be due to the reaction of sinking particles with undersaturated deep sea water just above the sea floor, rather than with the water column during sinking. About 20 % of the organic matter was decomposed between the shallow and deep sediment traps and more than 98 % between the deep sediment trap and final burial in the surface sediments. The relative amount of organic carbon preserved in surface sediments was about 0.10 % of annual primary productivity.","Carbon cycle; Seasonality; Sinking particle fluxes; Vertical variations; Western Pacific","marine sediment; organic matter; particulate flux; plankton; seasonality; sediment trap; vertical profile; water chemistry; Pacific Ocean; West Caroline Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032124761

The combined microbotanical data suggest human/environment interaction from at least the Early Holocene to the present. An amelioration of arid Late Pleistocene environments in this region is indicated by the development of herbaceous swamp and swamp forest communities at the core site. Early Holocene vegetation changes reflect the rapid expansion and diversification of mixed-deciduous forests, which may also have been disturbed by anthropogenic burning. The Late Holocene reduction in dry-land forest and the subsequent establishment of secondary-growth forests, suggests a further change to burning regimes. Changes in both human subsistence strategies as well as climate occurred during this period, including the critical transition to rice agriculture. These changing subsistence patterns are reflected in the Kumphawapi record by evidence of shifting burning regimes, including indirect evidence of agricultural activities in the Middle Holocene. The timing and nature of agricultural development indicated by the archaeological data for northeastern Thailand needs to be re-evaluated in order to account for the burning regimes and vegetation changes evident in the 3KUM microfossil record.","Palaeovegetation; Phytoliths; Pollen; Thailand","phytolith; pollen; Quaternary; vegetation history",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032170396

Effects were most severe in the lakes closest to the smelters which historically received very high deposition of both acid and metal particulates. After smelter emissions were greatly reduced in the 1970's, evidence began to emerge of improvements in lake water quality, and some recovery of biological communities, and the emphasis of Sudbury area monitoring programs changed from the assessment of damage to the tracking of recovery patterns. Further reductions in smelter emissions during the 1990's have been accompanied by continuing improvements in aquatic habitat quality, but the evaluation of lake responses to emission controls is complicated by the interaction of lake acidity and metal concentrations with other factors. Weather-related variations in storage and release of sulphur from lake catchments appear to greatly influence chemical recovery. Despite the general water quality improvements observed to date, some lakes are still highly acidic and elevated levels of copper and nickel persist in the water and sediments of many lakes. Severely damaged biological communities have been slow to recover, probably reflecting a combination of continuing habitat quality limitations and restricted opportunities for dispersal.","Acid; Biology; Chemistry; Lakes; Metals; Recovery; Sudbury","lake water; acidification; atmospheric deposition; ecosystem resilience; heavy metal; lake; smelting; water quality; acidity; Canada; ecosystem; industrial waste; lake; priority journal; review; water pollutant; water quality; Canada",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032323822

Large sulphur emission control programs were implemented in Europe and North America with the expectation that many affected aquatic ecosystems would recover. Because of a variety of factors, these positive expectations have been slow to be realized. Only limited evidence of the chemical recovery of acid lakes has emerged from areas other than the Sudbury, Canada region, where sulphur emission reductions were particularly large. Lake response models indicate that when current sulphur emission control strategies in Europe and North America are fully implemented, many lakes will still be acid-damaged even though substantial overall improvements in lake chemistry are expected. An increasing body of evidence indicates that substantial biological recovery, among many groups of organisms, can be expected when chemical conditions improve in lakes. Not all species, however, are capable of unassisted recovery and some lakes can pose biological or physical barriers to colonizers. Thus, stocking may be an important element in management strategies for the restoration of some recovering lakes. Communities in recovered lakes may not achieve predisturbance conditions, but establishment of typical communities appears to be a reasonable recovery target.","Acidification; Biological; Chemical; Lakes; Recovery","lake water; sulfur; acidification; ecosystem resilience; emission control; freshwater ecosystem; lake; restoration ecology; acid rain; Canada; environmental management; lake; model; priority journal; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032321911

Maps of critical loads for freshwaters have been produced in grid form based on water samples of representative sites within each grid square. However, the water chemistry data required to calculate freshwater critical loads are not always readily available at a national level and maps are therefore limited to catchments where such data exist. This paper describes the development of an approach that uses nationally available secondary data to predict freshwater critical loads for catchments lacking the appropriate water chemistry information. An empirical statistical model is calibrated using data from 78 catchments throughout Scotland. Water chemistry for each catchment has been determined. Each catchment is characterized according to a number of attributes. Redundancy analysis of these data shows clear relationships between catchment attributes and the critical load derived from the water chemistry. The key variables that explain most of the variation in critical load relate to soil, geology and land use within the catchment. Using these variables as predictors in a regression analysis, the critical load can be predicted across a broad gradient of sensitivity (R2(adj) = 0.81). The predictive power of the model was maintained when different combinations of explanatory variables were used. This accords the approach a degree of flexibility in that model parameterization can be geared toward availability of secondary data. There are limitations with the model as presently calibrated. However, the approach offers considerable scope for environmental managers to undertake national inventories of catchment sensitivity and specific assessments of individual catchments.","Acidification; Catchments; Freshwater critical loads; Predictive model; Scotland; Statistical modeling","Acidification; Catchments; Acidity; Geology; Land use; Mathematical models; Regression analysis; Sensitivity analysis; Soil pollution; Water analysis; Watersheds; Water pollution control; fresh water; acidification; catchment; critical state; modeling; parameterization; statistical analysis; water chemistry; acidification; article; environmental monitoring; statistical model; united kingdom; water pollution; water sampling; United Kingdom, Scotland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032127846

We make predictions regarding future mammal diversity patterns in Canada, and therefore provide a preliminary indication of where management intervention should be directed in order to conserve mammal diversity as climate changes. We also examine the current distributions of individual mammal species in Canada in order to determine which taxa cannot migrate farther north because of the Arctic Ocean barrier. Of the 25 species that fall into this category, we examine the predicted loss of habitat in one keystone species - Dicrostonyx groenlandicus, the collared lemming - and find that this taxon is likely to lose approximately 60% of its habitat with unpredictable but likely detrimental consequences for the arctic biota.

Usually there is no opportunity of desalination. Experiments with various sources of salts (sodium chloride, calcium chloride, magnesium chloride, sodium sulphate and magnesium sulphate) reduced growth rate and increased mortality in newly hatched chicks. The salt concentration of the experimental diets, however, were considerably higher than in the underground water. Moderate levels of sodium chloride may even increase body weight. Whether this increase is caused by higher levels of water retention in tissue has still to be proved. The response of laying hens to different sources of salts was highly variable, depending on duration of the application, and age of the hens. Extremely high concentration, which normally do not occur in underground water, are required to influence egg production. Effects on hatchability and egg shells defects occur at much lower concentrations. With regard to eggshell quality there are differences among genetic strains in tolerance to high sodium chloride concentrations in the drinking water. Also, hens at the end of the laying period are more susceptible than younger birds. Both young chicks and layers adapt to high salt concentrations by increasing their water consumption and the excretion of sodium and chloride ions through the kidneys.

Also, pH and concentrations of sodium and chloride were increased and the pCO2 and concentrations of bicarbonate and calcium were reduced in the fluid surrounding the egg lumen of the shell gland.

The Institute of Gas Technology (IGT) in the United States has joined the Gas Institute (GI) of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine to demonstrate and commercialize a technology developed by GI - indirect gas-fired, low-interia/ high-efficiency furnace - which is consistent with and meets all five of the criteria above.

Thus by applying this technology, the end user can benefit from increased productivity, improved part quality, reduced fuel consumption, emissions abatement, and reduced capital and operating costs.",,"Cost effectiveness; Fuel consumption; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Gas furnaces; Heat treatment; Industrial emissions; Industrial furnaces; Mathematical models; Thermal efficiency; Heat treating furnaces",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032206054

The SLR model can also be used as a tool in assessing the effectiveness of PM2.5 precursor control in meeting the new federal PM2.5 standards. The SLR assumptions, as well as results of control sensitivity runs, are discussed as an example of the utility of using SLR in PM2.5 attainment planning processes. In the South Coast Air Basin, the VOC emissions in the sensitivity runs were shown to have the least effect on reducing PM2.5 concentrations, while SOx, ammonia, NOx, and primary PM2.5 emissions have the greatest effect. Dairy ammonia emissions controls have a direct effect on the level of NOx reductions needed. The SLR simulation results further illustrate the sensitivity to achieve a PM2.5 air quality benefit of 1 ug/m3. This equates to 114 t/d reduction of NOx emissions, or 18 t/d reduction of SOx emissions, or 1,140 t/d reduction of VOC emissions, or an additional control from full Air Quality Management Plan control levels of 16 percent for dairy ammonia emissions or primary source emissions.

The eddy covariance . technique employing a tunable diode laser spectrometer was used to measure spatially integrated fluxes of methane. Rates of methane emission increased rapidly after sunrise and peaked (at up to 50 mg CH4 m-2 h-1) between midmorning and noon. The emission rates during midday hours were 2 to 5 times higher than the relatively constant rates observed at night. This marked diel variation was attributed to plant-mediated transport of methane by convective throughflow which typically accounted for about 60% of the total methane emission during the daylight hours. Our analysis suggests that the enhanced rate of plant-mediated methane emission during daytime is significantly correlated with changes in photosynthetically active radiation and the temperature difference between the canopy and the ambient air. Data on windy nights showed enhanced methane emission with increasing wind speeds, perhaps indicating an occurrence of Venturi-induced convection and/or enhanced ebullition. When averaged over the study period of 65 days, the methane flux was 25 mg CH4 m-2 h-1 during daytime and 8 mg CH4 m-2 h-1 during nighttime. Changes in the daily averaged methane flux were strongly correlated with sediment temperatures at 0-0.25 m depth.

The model predicted the observed concentrations well. Simulation based on a projected emission scenario in 2010 was performed which suggests that SO2 concentration at all places of central Dhaka will largely exceed 40 ppb in 2010 if no emission abatement measure is taken. A series of control strategy simulations was conducted to find out an appropriate method to reduce pollutant concentrations. Only abatement of traffic emissions by 50% would reduce SO2 concentration in 2010 to just below the air quality standard in the city center of Dhaka. The control scenario simulations also involved reduction of sulfur content (to 0.5%) in diesel fuel for traffic vehicles, and changing fuel type from diesel oil to gasoline and natural gas for vehicles which suggests that any one is sufficient to meet air quality standard for SO2 in downtown Dhaka by 2010, but natural gas technology is most efficient. The NO2 concentration in the city center would be about to exceed and would be well below the standard value in 2010 if the diesel fuel used in motor vehicles is replaced by gasoline and natural gas respectively. The simulation results suggest that industrial emissions have to be cut by 50% together with substituting natural gas for current diesel fuel for vehicles if the air quality standard of SO2 is to be satisfied in the highly polluted south-east industrial area of Dhaka. © Publications Division Selper Ltd., 1998.","Air pollution; Control strategy; Developing country; Dhaka; Simulation","Air pollution; Air quality; Air quality standards; Developing countries; Diesel engines; Diesel fuels; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Industrial emissions; Natural gas; Natural gas vehicles; Natural gas wells; Quality control; Chemical transformations; Control strategies; Dhaka; Emission scenario; Natural Gas Technology; Pollutant concentration; Scenario simulations; Simulation; Air pollution control; diesel fuel; gasoline; natural gas; nitrogen dioxide; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; pollutant transport; air quality; atmospheric pollution; pollution control; air pollution; air pollution control; air quality; air quality standard; article; Bangladesh; city; environmental protection; exhaust gas; industrial area; model; motor vehicle; Bangladesh; Dhaka",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031836227

The method was generally regarded as a reconnaissance tool looking for major structures. Major advances have been made in the last decade in the quality of aeromagnetic data so that low amplitude anomalies arising from magnetic bodies within the sedimentary section can now be measured with sufficient precision to provide information about the geology of the sedimentary rocks associated with hydrocarbon accumulations. This presents a challenge to the interpreter to develop better interpretation procedures to take full advantage of the high quality magnetic data. Recent developments in computer technology, instruments, processing and interpretation of the earth's magnetic field have significantly extended the scope of aeromagnetic surveys as a tool in the exploration for hydrocarbons. The new approach used in the analysis and interpretation of aeromagnetic survey data over sedimentary basins allows interpreters to fully utilise information carried by the magnetic field data. The high quality experimental aeromagnetic survey flown over part of the Eromanga and Cooper basins by Mines and Energy South Australia and Santos, shows that magnetic layers in the sedimentary rocks make this an appropriate area for exploration by detailed aeromagnetic surveys. By applying new interpretation techniques it is now possible to make fuller use of the high quality digital magnetic data. It is possible to delineate major structures within a weakly magnetic basement, to follow magnetic horizons within the sedimentary section, to pick out fault and joint patterns within the sediments, to detect abnormal magnetic regions which may be the result of alterations caused by hydrocarbon seepages and to compute the thickness of the sediments. The aeromagnetic method is very effective for interpolating between widely spaced seismic lines that are used to tie the magnetic interpretation to the stratigraphy. The depth to basement estimates made in this way are comparable with those derived from seismic survey data. Since the completion of the experimental research the methods developed have been successfully applied to several basins including ones in low latitudes, rugged terrains and volcanic provinces. The new approach to interpretation of aeromagnetic survey data is providing petroleum companies with quick, comprehensive and cost-effective tools for first- pass exploration. The non-invasive nature of the surveys makes them ideal for use in difficult terrains and in politically and environmentally sensitive areas. © 1998, CSIRO.

During the fall of 1993, 225 hospitals were surveyed with a response rate of 72.5%. The results reported here focus on infectious waste segregation practices, medical waste treatment and disposal practices, and the operating status of hospital incinerators in these three states. Hospitals were provided a definition of medical waste in the survey, but were queried about how they define infectious waste. The results implied that there was no consensus about which agency or organization's definition of infectious waste should be used in their waste management programs. Confusion around the definition of infectious waste may also have contributed to the finding that almost half of the hospitals are not segregating infectious waste from other medical waste. The most frequently used practice of treating and disposing of medical waste was the use of private haulers that transport medical waste to treatment facilities (61.5%). The next most frequently reported techniques were pouring into municipal sewage (46.6%), depositing in landfills (41.6%), and autoclaving (32.3%). Other methods adopted by hospitals included Electro-Thermal-Deac-tivation (ETD), hydropulping, microwaving, and grinding before pouring into the municipal sewer. Hospitals were asked to identify all methods they used in the treatment and disposal of medical waste. Percentages, therefore, add up to greater than 100% because the majority chose more than one method. Hospitals in Oregon and Washington used microwaving and ETD methods to treat medical waste, while those in Idaho did not. No hospitals in any of the states reported using irradiation as a treatment technique. Most hospitals in Oregon and Washington no longer operate their incinerators due to more stringent regulations regarding air pollution emissions. Hospitals in Idaho, however, were still operating incinerators in the absence of state regulations specific to these types of facilities. © 1998 Air & Waste Management Association.",,"Autoclaves; Land fill; Microwave heating; Sewers; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Hospital incinerators; Medical waste treatment; Hospitals; article; government; hospital; hospital waste; incineration; landfill; microwave radiation; priority journal; sewage; United States; waste disposal; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032104302

Science Department, California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA 91125, United States","A mechanistic air quality model has been constructed which is capable of predicting the contribution of individual emissions source types to the size- and chemical-composition distribution of airborne particles. This model incorporates all of the major aerosol processes relevant to regional air pollution studies including emissions, transport, deposition, gas-to-particle conversion and fog chemistry. In addition, the aerosol is represented as a source-oriented external mixture which is allowed to age in a more realistic fashion than can be accomplished when fresh particle-phase emissions are averaged into the pre-existing atmospheric aerosol size and composition distribution. A source-oriented external mixture is created by differentiating the primary particles emitted from the following source types: catalyst-equipped gasoline engines, non-catalyst-equipped gasoline engines, diesel engines, meat cooking, paved road dust, crustal material from sources other than paved road dust, and sulfur-bearing particles from fuel burning and industrial processes. Discrete primary seed particles from each of these source types are emitted into a simulation of atmospheric transport and chemical reaction. The individual particles evolve over time in the presence of gas-to-particle conversion processes while retaining information on the initial source from which they were emitted. The source- and age-resolved particle mechanics model is applied to the 1987 August SCAQS episode and comparisons are made between model predictions and observations at Claremont, CA. The model explains the origin of the bimodal character of the sub-micron aerosol size distribution. The mode located between 0.2 and 0.3 μm particle diameter is shaped by transformed emissions from diesel engines and meat cooking operations with lesser contributions from gasoline-powered vehicles and other fuel burning. The larger mode located at 0.7-0.8 μm particle diameter is due to fine particle background aerosol that has been further transformed by fog and by other gas-to-particle conversion processes. Smaller contributions to the mode located at 0.7-0.8 μm particle diameter are made by food cooking and by the fine particle fraction of paved and unpaved road dust. Separation of the contributions of particles from different sources helps to visualize the effect that different emissions control programs would have in advance of their adoption.","Air quality modeling; Airborne particles; Externally mixed aerosol; Source contributions","Air pollution source contributions; Air quality model; Urban pollution; Air pollution; Air pollution control; Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Mathematical models; Particle size analysis; Particulate emissions; Precipitation (meteorology); Atmospheric composition; sulfate; aerosol; air quality; atmospheric pollution; model; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; airborne particle; article; atmospheric transport; chemical reaction; combustion; cooking; diesel engine; dust; fog; meat; particle size; pollution transport; prediction; priority journal; united states",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032537886

The chemistry of the lower troposphere over the tropics, however, is poorly understood, in part because of the considerable uncertainties in VOC emissions from tropical ecosystems. Present global VOC models predict that base emissions of isoprene from tropical rainforests are considerably higher than from savannas. These global models of VOC emissions which rely mainly on species inventories are useful, but significant improvement might be made with more ecologically based models of VOC emissions by plants. Ecosystems along a successional transect from woodland savanna to primary rainforest in central Africa were characterized for species composition and vegetation abundance using ground surveys and remotely sensed data. A total of 336 species (mostly trees) at 13 sites were recorded, and 208 of these were measured for VOC emissions at near-optimal light and temperature conditions using a leaf cuvette and hand-held photoionization detector (PID). A subset of 59 species was also sampled using conventional VOC emission techniques in order to validate the PID technique. Results of ecological and VOC emission surveys indicate both phylogenetic and successional patterns along the savanna-rainforest transect. Genera and families of trees which tend to emit isoprene include Lophira, Irvingia, Albizia, Artocarpus, Ficus, Pterocarpus, Caesalpiniaceae, Arecaceae, and Moraceae. Other taxa tend to contain stored VOCs (Annonaceae and Asteraceae). Successional patterns suggest that isoprene emissions are highest in the relatively early successional Isoberlinia forest communities and progressively decrease in the later successional secondary and primary rainforest communities. Stored VOCs appear to increase along the savanna-rainforest succession, but these data are more tentative. These findings are consistent with successional patterns of isoprene and terpene fluxes in North American forests and highlight the feasibility of constructing better predictive models of VOC emissions.

We hypothesized that: (1) maximum rates and annual estimates of soil J(CO2) would be greater in more productive burned sites than in unburned sites, (2) soil J(CO2) would be greater in newly burned sites with a history of fire exclusion than in annually burned sites (consistent with differences in aboveground production), and (3) soil temperature and water availability would be primary abiotic determinants of soil J(CO2) in tallgrass prairie. A preliminary assessment of the effects of large herbivores on soil J(CO2) was included to evaluate the hypothesis that removal of aboveground biomass would reduce soil J(CO2). Results indicated that spring fire increased maximum monthly soil J(CO2) by 20-55% relative to unburned tallgrass prairie, with greatest monthly differences measured in April (fourfold higher in burned sites). In burned sites that differed in fire history, maximum monthly J(CO2) in annually burned prairie was 33% greater than in burned sites with a history of fire exclusion. Soil J(CO2) in these latter sites was still significantly higher than in unburned sites. Soil J(CO2) in sites grazed by bison was reduced by as much as 30% relative to adjacent ungrazed areas. Reduced root biomass and activity in grazed areas, unburned sites, and sites with a history of fire exclusion suggest that plants play a major role in determining soil J(CO2) in this grassland. Soil temperature at 5 cm was related strongly to midday J(CO2) in both annually burned sites (r2 = 0.58) and unburned sites (r2 = 0.71). In contrast, differences in soil moisture among sites, enhanced by comparing irrigated grassland to control areas, increased maximum monthly J(CO2) by only 8%. Thus, soil temperature was the primary abiotic determinant of soil J(CO2) during this study. Maximum monthly estimates of soil J(CO2) in tallgrass prairie ranged from 10.3 μmol CO2·m-2·s-1 in unburned sites to 15.1 μmol·m-2·s-1 in annually burned irrigated sites, whereas annual estimates varied from 4.7 to 7.8 kg CO2/m2. Over the 2-yr period, spring fire increased estimated annual soil J(CO2) by 38-51% relative to unburned sites, while irrigation increased annual soil J(CO2) by 13%. These estimates for tallgrass prairie are much higher than those reported for most temperate ecosystems but are similar to estimates for tropical forests. Characteristics of undisturbed tallgrass prairie that may lead to high levels of soil J(CO2) include: high above- and belowground productivity; a relatively high proportion of C stored belowground; levels of soil microbial biomass and activity that are among the highest in native ecosystems in the United States; and the lack of a single dominant factor such as temperature, moisture, or nutrient availability, that consistently limits biotic processes during the growing season. The sensitivity of soil J(CO2) in tallgrass prairie to different land use practices (fire and grazing) suggests that it is critical to include these factors in the development of grassland C budgets, as well as in regional models that estimate biogeochemical responses to land use change.","Fire; Grassland; Grazing; Land management; Soil CO2 flux; Soil respiration; Tallgrass prairie","carbon dioxide; carbon flux; fire history; grassland; land management; Kansas; Konza Prairie; United States; Bison; Bubalus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031828540

In a case study, 51 western Pacific storm cases under present-day climate conditions were compared with 51 storm cases under high-CO2 conditions. More idealized experiments were also performed. The large-scale initial conditions were derived from a global climate model.

Titania (TiO2) first lowered its oxidation state to Ti3O5 via an unidentified phase (possibly one of the Magneli phases). Then Ti3O5 was further reduced to Ti2O3, followed by the formation of titanium oxycarbide (TiCxOy) phase and its purification toward high purity TiC thereafter. Ti2O3 was the oxide phase with the lowest oxidation state before forming TiCxOy phase. In the isothermal TGA trace, the formation of Ti3O5 showed a diffusion-controlled process; possibly carbon diffusion limited the solid state reaction. The formation of Ti2O3 and TiCxOy was interpreted to be associated with CO gas-assisted reduction reaction, based on constant reaction rate for each process. The activation energy for the formation of Ti2O3 (from Ti3O5) and TiCxOy (from Ti2O3) phase were calculated to be 415.6 and 264.3 kJ mol-1, respectively.

The bombarding ions could traverse the samples but the cluster constituents did not remain in proximity in all cases. The luminescence was registrated by time-correlated single photon counting using either secondary electrons or transmitted clusters for starting the measurement. The relative photon yield obtained with clusters of various size increases linearly with the number of cluster constituents. The increase is less pronounced in case of the thin sample.

In this study, we reconstruct the diets of proboscideans and associated mammals through isotopic analysis of carbonate in tooth enamel apatite in order to test nutritional hypotheses for late Pleistocene extinction. We analyzed specimens from six sites in Florida, ranging from full glacial (&gt; 21,000 BP) to late glacial (14,750 to 10,000 BP) age. The oxygen isotope composition of mammalian apatite covaries with meteoric water composition, which in turn varies with climate. Consequently, oxygen isotope analysis can be used to assess the potential for time-averaging or mixing of specimens from different geographic regions within fossil assemblages. The carbon isotope composition of an herbivore is controlled by the isotopic composition of the plants that it ingests. Carbon isotope analysis reveals that mastodons ate chiefly C3 plants, presumably trees, shrubs and herbs, whereas mammoths consumed chiefly C4 grass. Several nutritional hypothesis for late Pleistocene extinction entail the assumption that extinct taxa had specialized diets. The resource partitioning and focused feeding preferences of Florida's proboscideans corroborate this assumption, but they do not, in themselves, prove that nutritional stress was the cause of the late Pleistocene extinction.","Isotopic ecology; Late Pleistocene mammals; North America","diet; extinction; isotopic analysis; paleoecology; Pleistocene; tooth; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032418524

Total light-scattering ωλ,bsp and backscattering ωλ,sp coefficients at wavelength λ, the hygroscopic growth factors with respect to scattering, f(RH)λ,s, and the backscatter ratio bλ are the parameters considered in the paper. Reference and controlled relative humidity nephelometry measurements were taken at a ground level field sampling station, located near Bondville Illinois (40°03′12″ N, W 88°22′19″ W). Aerosol particle chemical composition and mass particle size distributions were also measured. The target parameters were also estimated from models. The modeling approach involved a two-step process. In the first step, aerosol properties were parameterized with an approach that made use of a modified thermodynamic equilibrium model, published laboratory measurements of single hygroscopic particle properties, and empirical mixing rules. In the second step, the parameterized aerosol properties were used as inputs into a code that calculate ωλ,sp and ωλ,bsp as functions of λ, RH, particle size, and composition. Comparison between the measured and the modeled results showed that depending on the assumptions, the differences between the modeled and observed results were within 5 to 28% for f(RH)λ,s and within 22-35% for bλ at low RH and 0-20% for bλ at high RH. The temporal variation of the particle size distribution, the equilibrium state of the particles, and the hygroscopicity of the material characterized as residual were the major factors limiting the predictive ability of the models.

A series of hypothetical climate change scenarios and GCM-generated IPCC Business-as-Usual scenario estimates of temperature and precipitation changes were used to examine implications of climate change for seasonal changes in actual evapotranspiration, soil moisture deficit, and soil moisture surplus in 13 subregions of the GAP. Of particular importance are predicted patterns of enhancement in summer soil moisture deficit that are consistent across the region in all scenarios. Least effect of the projected warming on the soil moisture deficit enhancement is observed with the IPCC estimates. The projected temperature changes would be responsible for a great portion of the enhancement in summer deficits in the GAP region. The increase in precipitation had less effect on depletion rate of soil moisture when the temperatures increase. Particularly southern and southeastern parts of the region will suffer severe moisture shortages during summer. Winter surplus decreased in scenarios with increased temperature and decreased precipitation in most cases. Even when precipitation was not changed, total annual surplus decreased by 4 percent to 43 percent for a 2 °C warming and by 8 percent to 91 percent for a 4 °C warming. These hydrologic results may have significant implications for water availability in the GAP as the present project evaluations lack climate change analysis. Adaptation strategies - such as changes in crop varieties, applying more advanced dry farming methods, improved water management, developing more efficient irrigation systems, and changes in planting - will be important in limiting adverse effects and taking advantage of beneficial changes in climate.",,"climate change; evapotranspiration; soil moisture; warming; Anatolia; Turkey; Aves; Meleagris gallopavo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031797160

No specific labelling for pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) was observed in the PCK-CAM species. In the ME-CAM species, the patterns of labelling for PPDK differed.

The conversion efficiency, however, depends very strongly on the working temperature. The efficiency of a precious metalcontaining catalyst, for example, declines very steeply for a temperature of below around 350°C, and the conversion efficiency is practically zero for cold engines (starting and warming-up period). Preheating of the catalyst with an electrical power, warming it up with an external combustion chamber, and installation of an auxiliary small capacity catalytic converter, are some of the more successful solutions. Although these methods are quite effective, all employ active means that require an external energy source and a control unit. In the present work, the exploitation of thermal capacitance to keep the catalyst temperature high during a short parking period was studied. The present system consists of a precious metal-containing catalyst imbedded in a special designed phase-change-material (PCM). Under normal engine operation conditions, some of the thermal energy of the exhaust gases is stored in the PCM in which the catalyst is imbedded. During parking, the PCM undergoes partial solidification and the catalyst temperature is thus maintained inside the desired temperature range for maximal conversion efficiency. The unique features of this method are: a) no special energy source is needed to heat the converter, since the energy of the exhaust gas from the engine is stored and used; and b) the operation is simple and no active or control means are required. The main disadvantage of the method is that it is effective only within a specific length period after engine shut off, the time depending on the thermal specifications of the system. An experimental device on which to conduct feasibility studies was designed, built and tested. It was constructed from a commercially available catalytic converter (with a light-off temperature conversion of about 310°C), in which was embedded 3.8kg of a PCM, composed of a eutectic mixture with additives (353°C melting point and 251.5kJ/kg latent heat of fusion). This design included both an insulation jacket and ceramic pipe fittings to reduce heat losses to the surroundings. The results with this experimental tested system showed that after engine shut-off, the catalyst temperature remained above the highest (for HC) light-off temperature for about 4h. These results demonstrate that this method might be effective in reducing pollutant gases from vehicles in large cities, where the average number of re-startings per vehicle per day is high.

Only a 'small' annual increase of this pool could trap the current surplus of atmospheric CO2. The fact that this is not happening already today (after the world has seen a 27% increase in atmospheric CO2 in only 150 years) sets the boundaries of the likely trends to be expected in the future. In contrast to the possibly small overall responses of the tropical forest carbon pool, individual plant responses to CO2 enrichment will be significant. Since species and their genotypes will not respond in identical ways, selective processes will be induced which will lead to new community structures and alterations of numerous plant-plant, plant-animal and plant-microbe interactions. Examples are provided for such subtile CO2 effects; measured both in the greenhouse and in the field. From what is known currently it is concluded that in closed humid tropical forests leaf area index is unlikely to increase, mineral nutrient and water demand may (at least temporarily) become reduced, and leaf tissue quality plus associated consumer behavior will be altered. The big unknown is the behavior of tropical soils and their microflora and fauna. There is a realistic possibility that carbon turnover will be increased in tropical forests in a CO2-enriched world, which would have substantial implications for nutrient cycling.",,"carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; community structure; tropical forest",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031853889

The lifetime of the I1 bound excitons in CdS platelets is found to be initially enhanced with increasing driving amplitude whereas a drop in the lifetime is achieved at sufficiently high drivings. The line shape of the I1 exciton PL lines experiences remarkable broadening in the region of the lifetime decrease and this is accompanied by a reduced light emission in the acoustic phonon wing of the I1 exciton PL line. Additionally, an enhancement of the E1 LO phonon resonant Raman line and an appearance of the A1 LO phonon Raman line, normally forbidden in the employed scattering geometry, are achieved by increasing the driving amplitude. The detailed analysis of the observations is made within the framework of internal electric fields generated by the driving. It is shown that the effects presented can be reasonably well understood by taking into account both the long-range electric fields and nonuniform microfields accompanying acoustic driving. It is shown that the microfields likely arise from variations in the local-crystal environment at the exciton site imposed by the driving. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Optical spectra of this star in its inactive state taken at the Haute Provence Observatory as well as the spectra of late type giant's of the same spectral type have been used. The comparison of the results obtained suggests that the time evolution of the physical parameters of CH Cyg reflect the symbiotic phenomena rather than the intrinsic variability of the cool component. The time behaviour of the Balmer emission line profiles rules out the general validity of the established models. An acceptable model valid at least for the observed period has been proposed. According to it, an envelope of variable optical thickness surrounds the hot component. The development of its inner radius, of Hα and Hβ line profiles and of the λ5007 [OIII] nebular line leads to the conclusion that the inactive state is not stationary, but is gradually evolving in time toward the new activity of the star.","Stars: binaries: symbiotic; Stars: CH Cygni",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10044237152

The results showed that newer engines with electronic engine controls and higher injector pressures produce TPM decreases from the 1988 to 1991 to 1995 engines with the solids decreasing more than the soluble organic fraction (SOF) of TPM. The total number of particles increased while the total volume of particles decreased from the 1988 to 1991 to 1995 engines. Use of EGR significantly reduced NOx emissions. At steady-state modes 9 and 11 at 20% EGR rate, NOx emissions were reduced by 56% and 29%, respectively. The particulate emissions increased as the EGR rate was increased, as was expected since fuel injection and the combustion system were not optimized for EGR. At mode 9, brake specific (BS) TPM emissions have increased by 16% and by 57% at 10.8% and 16.8% EGR respectively. At mode 11, BSTPM emissions decreased by 11% at 10.6% EGR and increased by 3% at 16.2% EGR. The SOL portion of the TPM increased with increased EGR for all modes and EGR rates and the SOF portion generally decreased with increasing EGR. EGR decreases the number and increases the volume of emitted particles. The total polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) emissions (vapor plus particle phase levels for a given compound) for fluoranthene, pyrene, and benz[a]anthracene were increased at Mode 11 with the higher EGR rate compared to the lower rate. At mode 9 there was no change in the total emissions. The particle phase emissions of benzo[b]fluoranthene, benzo[k]fluoranthene, and benzo[a]pyrene were decreased at the higher EGR rate at Mode 11, and below detection limits for either rate at Mode 9. The mutagenic activity of the SOF increased with EGR use, but the activity of the XOC decreased with EGR use. © 1998 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Chemical analysis; Diesel engines; Exhaust gas recirculation; Exhaust gases; Fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Particle size; Pyrene; Sols; Chemical and biologicals; Electronic engine controls; Exhaust gas recirculation (EGR); Heavy-duty diesel engine; Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons; Soluble organic fraction; Steady-state operating conditions; Total particulate matter; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072453740

UV, fluorescence, single-photon counting, and laser flash photolysis were employed as techniques for photophysical characterization. Redox properties were determined using cyclic voltammetry. Detailed steady-state quenching studies of 2-9 with MV2+, OV2+, and MPVS have shown different supramolecular interactions between sensitizer and acceptor in the case of MV2+. These effects may be explained by π-π donor-acceptor attractions as well as hydrophobic interactions. Supporting molecular modeling studies have been done. The suitability as biomimetic model systems was shown by testing the ruthenium complexes 2-9 in artificial photosynthesis systems.

They report three such cases, demonstrating that this complication can occur during treatment of brain tumors. In all patients, consciousness levels deteriorated within 1 to 2 days. Serum lactic acid levels increased to concentrations between 62 and 96.7 mg/dl, resulting in severe metabolic acidosis. A low blood thiamine level (9 ng/ml) was demonstrated at the onset in one case, and high-dose thiamine infusions dramatically improved lactic acidemia as well as impairment of consciousness in two cases. In the other case, hydrocephalus was suspected initially, resulting in a delay in thiamine supplementation. Clinical differentiation Of this form of lactic acidosis from hydrocephalus or tumor progression can be very difficult in a patient undergoing treatment for a malignant brain tumor. Demand for thiamine is thought to be increased in patients with malignant brain tumors, and supplemental thiamine during treatment is necessary to prevent lactic acidosis. When this complication occurs, immediate treatment with sufficient thiamine is essential, together with normalization of pH by using sodium bicarbonate.

Very low NOx emissions, averaging 1.0 g/bhp-hr over hot-start cycles, were attained; at these conditions, reductions in engine-out nonmethane hydro-carbons emissions (NMHC) were approximately 30 percent, and fuel consumption over the cycle was also reduced relative to the baseline. The lowest NOx results obtained were below 0.77 g/bhp-hr. Composite cold-start/hot-start test results were also very good, with NOx at approximately 1.0 g/bhp-hr and engine-out NMHC emissions less than 0.5 g/bhp-hr. Overall, the NO x versus efficiency tradeoff for the engine was improved significantly. Also, in comparison to the California Air Resource Board ultra low-emissions vehicle (ULEV) standards, the composite test results were roughly 60 percent of the ULEV standards for NOx + NMHC, and the results for the lowest NOx cycle were below one half of the NOx + NMHC standard. Carbon monoxide and particulate matter were also well below the ULEV limits, again with no oxidation catalyst being used. © 1998 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Carbon monoxide; Gas engines; Natural gas; Nitrogen oxides; Testing; California Air Resource Board; Engine optimization; Federal test procedures; Heavy duty engines; National Renewable Energy Laboratory; Non-methane hydrocarbons; Particulate Matter; Simultaneous reduction; Gas emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072453168

While the eastern rain forest recedes in the face of swidden cultivators, the highlands demonstrate more constructive transformations. In this paper I present a case study of land-use change in Leimavo, a small village near Ambositra studied in the 1960s by Jean-Pierre Raison. Here, the twentieth century has seen a gradual reduction in irrigated rice cultivation and cattle husbandry, and a boom in market-oriented orange, vegetable, and grain production. In the long term, a historical landscape of grassy hills has been transformed into a productive cultural landscape with woodlots, anti-erosion benching, rice terraces, fruit groves, and diverse crops. Critical factors determining the trajectory of land-use change include regional population pressure, state policies, market incentives, climate variations, and access to land and water resources. These critical factors, or explanations, are linked in the discussion by the use of a simple heuristic device—the range of choice—as a theoretical framework. © 1998 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

The investigations of hypertext form part of a research project on the design and use of multimedia systems, and hypertext in particular, for assessing planning applications for large scale building developments, such as chemical plants which are subject to the Air Pollution Laws (Immissionsschutzgesetz). The key question treated here is whether hypertext makes it easier to read and assess such planning applications for experts (officials of the regional government and advisers to interest groups) and for lay people who may be objectors (such as members of ecology groups or those living in the neighbourhood). The development and testing of a hypertext system for this purpose involves considering the literature in psychology on cognitive differences between reading conventional and hypertext documents and on advantages and disadvantages of hypertext. From the literature review and from interview data, it is concluded that hypertext has fewer benefits in this situation than it appears to promise; while there are some advantages for experts, who nevertheless also need to apply conventional reading strategies to conventional paper texts, it is of limited use to the lay non-experts who have an interest in planning inquiries.

Conceived largely in response to the Bhopal, India disaster in 1984, EPCRA was designed to compel state and local government to plan for unanticipated environmental excursions of hazardous chemicals. The TRI has evolved into a significant tool for regulatory agencies and public interest groups to use in assessing toxic chemical releases to the environment and, by inference, for use as a local indicator of environmental quality. An analysis of the TRI is limited almost exclusively to comparison of the annual discharge of pollutants to different media from year to year. The validity of this type of analysis has been seriously questioned as it fails to address even superficially the toxicity, persistence, and exposure factors arising from the reported releases. This paper explores the use of an adaptive method of scoring the chemical releases taking into consideration human and environmental toxicity and the potential for exposure. The relative risk of typical TRI emissions from the ship building, repair, and maintenance industry are scored and compared to other sources of TRI emissions. A software program for use by the industry to do self-scoring was developed by the Environmental Resources and Information Center (ERIC) at the University of New Orleans.",,"Computer software; Construction industry; Environmental protection; Hazardous materials; Industrial emissions; Laws and legislation; Maintenance; Repair; Risk assessment; Environmental quality; Hazard value method (HVM); Toxics release inventory (TRI); Shipbuilding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031997635

The turn-on voltage decreases with increasing temperature for the P-doped diamond film. On the other hand, there is no variation in the turn-on voltage for the undoped diamond film. It is considered that ionized donor concentration related to P atoms increases with increasing temperature, leading to a reduction of the tunnel barrier width between diamond and cathode. As a result, emission current increases. This indicates that the internal electron emission determines the field emission characteristics. A reduction of the turn-on voltage with increasing P-related donor concentration can be also understood by the internal electron emission.

Absolute photoemission cross sections from threshold to 200 eV and appearance potentials were determined for the Lyman-α and Lyman-β emissions for each of the three targets. The measured apparent emission cross sections at 100 eV impact energy for the Lyman-α lines are 6.0 × 10-19 cm2 for TMS, 6.5 × 10-19 cm2 for HMDSO and 1.1 × 10-18 cm2 for TEOS. The apparent Lyman-α cross sections for all three targets contained significant cascade contributions from the H Balmer series. Detailed studies of the near threshold regions indicated that several break-up mechanisms of the parent molecules contribute to the emissions. The lowest onsets for HMDSO, and TEOS were attributed to the removal of a single excited atomic hydrogen atom in the n = 2 state. Additional onsets at higher energies could not be uniquely correlated in all cases with a particular break-up channel and (or) cascading, since the other fragments in these processes were not identified.

These traditional approaches focus on institutional aspects of policy making rather than environmental considerations. This article will demonstrate that effectiveness cannot be analyzed from an institutional perspective alone because of the complexity of the social context in which international environmental agreements operate. The critical loads approach has long be incorporated in the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP), but only the 1994 protocol on further sulfur reductions uses the critical loads approach as the basis for emission reductions. Critical loads are based on environmental models using scientific knowledge to determine a region's emission threshold above which environmental degradation will occur. For each state, maps have been developed that indicate levels of acid deposition and acid-sensitive areas. These are the bases for calculations that show the sulfur dioxide emission reductions necessary in order to reach an overall 60% reduction target. This means that the role of scientific experts advising on threshold values, emission trajectories, ecosystem tolerance, and the like is becoming more visible in the international enviornmental policy-making process. Using the critical loads approach this article will examine what challenges arise from the study of the environment in IR. In order to do this, existing IR approaches to environmental policy making will be discussed briefly, followed by a study of CLRTAP and the critical loads approach. Then, the consequences for IR theory and challenges for the future will be considered.",,"atmospheric pollution; emission control; environmental policy; international relations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345725990

The analysis demonstrates a gradual change of the projected unit cell dimensions from those of a hexagonal packing of hydrocarbon chains, characteristic of high-temperature monolayer phases, to one of two more dense rectangular packing modes with the projected unit cell dimensions 5.0 × 7.5 Å2 and 4.4 × 8.7 Å2, characteristic of low-temperature phases. The 5.0 × 7.5 Å2 unit cell incorporates the well-known herringbone arrangement, with an ideally 90° dihedral angle between the planes of carbon backbone chains. The 4.4 × 8.7 Å2 cell, almost never observed in 3D structures, is characterized by a 40° dihedral angle. We characterize the packing modes by lattice energy calculations. The distribution of the projected unit cell dimensions for the various Langmuir monolayers reveals no discontinuity in the local molecular order between crystalline phases and mesophases. The local symmetry of the molecular packing, as determined from the X-ray data, is compared with the symmetry deduced from the Landau theory of phase transitions. The symmetry of the local order in the mesophases is not maintained on the long-range length scale. We show that two phases of the same local molecular arrangement, a herringbone-ordered two-dimensional crystal and the corresponding one-dimensional mesophase, possess mutually orthogonal directions of glide symmetry.",,"Condensation; Crystal lattices; Crystal symmetry; Hydrocarbons; Molecular structure; X ray crystallography; Grazing incidence X ray diffraction; Langmuir monolayers; Monolayers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032493249

In 1992, Florida initiated a motor vehicle inspection program for six counties that were identified as nonattainment areas for ozone pursuant to the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. The costeffectiveness of Florida's motor vehicle inspection program in reducing emissions is evaluated, and the results are compared with the costeffectiveness of other MVIP technologies that are available as alternatives to Florida's current program. Five combinations of current MVIP technologies were chosen as the alternatives for analysis that represent the range of options available for a motor vehicle inspection program. The results of the cost-effectiveness analysis indicate that the program including the technology of Accelerated Simulation Mode is the most cost-effective of all of the alternatives presented. This program is much more cost-effective in reducing pollutants than the current inspection program in Florida, an annual idle test. In addition, this program is estimated to eliminate more absolute megagrams (tons) of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides. The legislature of Florida has continually examined the issue of continuing or changing the motor vehicle inspection program in Florida. However, no changes have been made to the program since its inception in 1992. The cost-effectiveness comparisons of MVIPs could be useful to other communities searching for costeffective methods of reducing mobile source emissions.",,"Air pollution; Cost effectiveness; Gas emissions; Inspection; Accelerated simulation mode; Mobile source emissions; Motor vehicle inspection programs; Vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032157533

We focus on a case of hydrocarbon recovery (Lacq, France), well constrained both in terms of production parameters and fracturing pattern, as a result of a 20-year monitoring of induced seismicity. Production, which plays the role of a stressing rate for the rocks surrounding the depleted zones, appears to have profound impact on the fracturing pattern of the reservoir, that ranges from a localized damage with relatively large fractures, to a diffuse damage with relatively small fractures, for high and low values of the production, respectively. As the fracturing pattern has been recently proposed to have far-reaching importance for the permeability and the increase of productivity of the reservoir through time, this study suggests the possibility to use production as a knob, so as to tune the response of the reservoir to a level of most efficient fracturing, in terms of hydrocarbon recovery. A careful monitoring of seismic indexes may help pinpoint the ongoing type of fracturing, and adjust production accordingly.

Deletion constructs with various lengths of the 5' flanking region of the human CAII promoter were ligated to the CAT reporter gene and lipofected in primary cultures of mouse proximal renal tubular cells and in cells of the established porcine proximal tubular cell line, LLC-PK1. The CAT activity was measured 48 hours after gene transfection. The -12000/CAT and -1300/CAT constructs expressed the highest CAT activity in both types of renal tubular cells (143- and 180-fold increase, respectively, in mouse proximal tubular cells; 50- and 70-fold increase, respectively, in LLC-PK1 cells) but not the -420/CAT, -270/CAT, or -180/CAT constructs (9, 12, and 9% of that of -1300/CAT construct, respectively, in mouse proximal tubular cells and, 23, 9, and 8%, respectively, in LLC-PK1 cells, all p &lt;0.01 vs. -1300/CAT construct). No cytotoxicity was detected in the transfected cells. A computer search identified multiple putative transcription factor binding elements including Ap1 and Ap2 binding elements, which are present in the -1300/CAT construct but not in the shorter constructs.

Computer aided models are usually used to generate this emission data because it is not possible to obtain measurements from all sources, and, furthermore, a large amount of data has to be handled. For the development of emission modeling systems, a software tool called CAREAIR has been created. The intention of this paper is to introduce CAREAIR to the international community dealing with emission inventories and air quality improvement strategies. CAREAIR is not just a single emission model but a flexible modeling toolbox. The database contains data and formulas for data manipulation, which is performed by using a set of flexible operators with different specifications. The emission calculation is carried out by combining several data manipulation operators. The CAREAIR modeling toolbox allows model implementation for the calculation of emissions from different pollutants in a high spatial and temporal resolution. The application of CAREAIR within various investigation projects in Germany, Europe, and Nigeria shows that CAREAIR is an appropriate instrument for the development of flexible emission models by meeting the various demands of these projects. The function and the data structures of this modeling toolbox are described and, towards the end of the paper, an example of an emission calculation with CAREAIR is given. © 1998 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"Computer aided analysis; Computer simulation; Computer software; Gas emissions; Ozone; Particulate emissions; Troposphere; Atmospheric modeling systems; Software package CAREAIR; Air pollution control; nitrogen oxide; solvent; volatile organic compound; air pollution; air quality; article; calculation; computer model; computer program; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032374039

Too often, however, analysis of energy and climate policy does not realistically reflect technological conditions and the dynamics of technological change. This tendency unnecessarily associates the decline in energy consumption or carbon emissions with the decline in national economic output or income. But there is ample prima facie evidence to the contrary. Just as in the 19th century when the perceived need to reduce labor inputs as part of the production process spurred labor-saving technological progress, now the need to reduce energy (and pollution) costs could spur innovation and diffusion of efficient and clean energy technologies. This, in turn, can increase overall growth in economic productivity. Energy technology analysts have identified many such existing and near-term commercial technologies, as well as innovations that can be foreseen beyond the immediate technological horizon, which would become widely used if policies were developed to overcome market and institutional barriers. This paper presents a macroeconomic analysis for a set of policies that would induce the adoption of more efficient and low-carbon technologies, and finds that overall employment and economic output could be increased by small amounts while significantly reducing carbon emissions.",,"climate policy; economic growth; economic impact; employment generation; environmental economics; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031855294

This study (Lal et al., 1998) reported our findings on the performance of each of the 17 global climate model experiments in simulating the present-day regional climatology over the Indian subcontinent. The analysis suggested that a few global climate models performed exceptionally well in their control simulation to represent the observed present-day climatological patterns over the region of interest. In this paper, we focus on the development of plausible climate change scenario for the Indian subcontinent based on selected model simulations with enhanced greenhouse gas forcings. Our analysis suggests that, for a 1°C rise in mean annual global temperature, the seasonal surface air temperature increase over the Indian subcontinent is likely to range from 0.7°C to 1.1°C during winter and 0.6°C to 1.0°C during summer. The increase in summer precipitation associated with the projected scaled rise in surface temperature could be between 1.2% to 4.5%. The model results do not suggest any significant change in the winter precipitation over the region. Taking into account the suggested range of climate sensitivity as well as the range of future greenhouse gas-induced global warming in selected general circulation model experiments, a plausible climate change scenario for the Indian subcontinent is developed for the years 2030 and 2070. A rise in mean winter surface air temperature of between 0.4°C to 1.7°C by the year 2030 and between 0.7°C to 3.4°C by the year 2070 is projected. During the summer season, the temperature rise is expected to range between 0.3°C to 1.4°C by the year 2030 and 0.6°C to 3.1°C by the year 2070. The study suggests intense spells of summer monsoon rainfall over the Indian subcontinent due to enhanced convective activity in a warmer atmosphere.","Global Climate Models; Global Warming; Indian Subcontinent; Monsoon; Regional Climate Change",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0037768579

The single tryptophan residue of Rev, Trp45, located within the arginine-rich RNA- binding domain of the protein, was utilized as an intrinsic spectroscopic probe. In addition, five peptides spanning different lengths of the arginine- rich domain, each containing the tryptophan residue, and two C-terminal deletion mutants of Rev, Rev M9Δ14 and Rev M11Δ14, were examined. Rev M9Δ14 lacks residues 68-112 whereas Rev M11Δ14 is missing residues 92-112 of the C-terminus of Rev. The fluorescence decay of Trp45 in wild-type Rev was resolved into four discrete lifetime components, and decay-associated spectra (DAS) were obtained for each component. The fluorescence decays of all five peptides and Rev M9Δ14 were resolved into three lifetime components. The fluorescence decay of Rev M11Δ14 was resolved into four components similar to those found for wild-type Rev. These results indicate that the activation domain (residues 78-93), present in wild-type Rev and Rev M11Δ14, induced a unique tryptophan environment, characterized by a short- lived, blue-shifted emission, attributed to higher order assembly of Rev. In addition, fluorescence anisotropy decay data obtained for wild-type Rev and the two C-terminal deletion mutants also indicate that the activation domain mediates self-association of Rev. Based on the anisotropy decay results for wild-type Rev, the distribution of oligomers is independent of salt concentration. The average fluorescence lifetime of Trp45 was reduced upon complexation of Rev with a 40-mer fragment of the Rev response element containing the minimal element for Rev binding (F8-RRE), and the emission was blue-shifted.

The gelatinous cyanobacterial Collema tenax is a dominant lichen of biotic soil crusts in the western United States. In laboratory experiments, we studied CO2 exchange of this species as dependent on water content (WC), light and temperature. Results are compared with performance of green-algal lichens of the same site investigated earlier. 2. As compared with published data, photosynthetic capacity of C. tenax is higher than that of other cyanobacterial and green-algal soil-crust species studied. At all temperatures and photon flux densities of ecological relevance, net photosynthesis (NP) shows a strong depression at high degrees of hydration; maximal apparent quantum-use efficiency of CO2 fixation is also reduced. Water requirements (moisture compensation point, WC for maximal NP) are higher than that of the green-algal lichens. Collema tenax exhibits extreme 'sun plant' features and is adapted to high thallus temperatures. 3. Erratic rain showers are the main source of moisture for soil crusts on the Colorado Plateau, quickly saturating the lichens with liquid water. High water-holding capacity of C. tenax ensures extended phases of favourable hydration at conditions of high light and temperature after the rain for substantial photosynthetic production. Under such conditions the cyanobacterial lichen appears superior over its green-algal competitors, which seem better adapted to habitats with high air humidity, dew or fog as prevailing source of moisture.","Carbon fixation; Cryptobiotic crust; Cryptogamic crust; Water relations","cyanobacterial; lichen; light; photosynthesis; temperature; water content; USA, Utah",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031862660

The rivers studied, the Blackstone, the Pawtuxet, the Moshassuck, and the Woonasquatucket, constitute the majority of river flow to the estuary. The unfiltered river water samples were extracted and analyzed for total aliphatic hydrocarbons, including natural and petroleum-derived species. The results of the year-long study revealed consistent oil pollution in all of the rivers sampled. Crankcase oil was ubiquitous, but the presence as well of fuel oils and, particularly in the Moshassuck River, gasoline (or kerosene), demonstrate that these rivers are subject to considerable oil pollution stress. The average concentration of hydrocarbons was ≃37 μg l-1 which, according to some toxicologists, indicates that sensitive organisms may be under stress. In addition, most samples showed evidence of small amounts of terrigenous plant wax hydrocarbons. Hydrocarbon concentrations are comparable to those in other urban rivers but are higher than in rivers from rural areas; moreover, they did not vary in any systematic way with season. The mass transport of hydrocarbons in each of the rivers generally mimicked trends in river discharge, thereby emitting the lowest mass to the estuary in the summer and increasing throughout the remainder of the year. Moreover, due primarily to relative discharge differences, the Blackstone and Pawtuxet rivers constitute 90% of the total calculated flux of hydrocarbons from all four rivers. By combining the results from this investigation with those from previous studies, it was possible to obtain an estimate of the total annual inputs of these contaminants to Narragansett Bay. Total annual loads from rivers and wastewater treatment facilities were approximately 240 mt. When sources such as wet weather inputs were included, the total increased to 420 mt yr-1. This value represents direct current inputs to the system and is considerably lower than previously published estimates. The current direct input estimate, while indicative of an improving situation, differs from previous estimates in that the latter were based upon calculations that approximated the long-term loadings from the watersheds, most of which are likely accumulating above the fall-lines of rivers throughout the watershed. Nevertheless, the current loadings represent a significant chronic flux of hydrocarbons to Narragansett Bay. For example, this estimate indicates that an amount equal to approximately 43% of the oil discharged into Narragansett Bay from the recent World Prodigy oil spill enters the estuary from chronic sources every year.",,"hydrocarbon; river discharge; river water quality; Narragansett Bay; Rhode Island; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031890316

The predominant mutation patterns of these tumors also suggest differences in their etiology. We tested the hypothesis that genetic susceptibility to PAHs, as determined by polymorphisms in CYP1A1 and GSTM1, predominantly causes lung SCCs, and susceptibility to nitrosamines, as determined by polymorphisms in CYP2E1, predominantly causes lung ACs. CYP1A1 and GSTM1 play a major role in the metabolic activation and detoxification of PAHs, respectively, and CYP2E1 plays a major role in the metabolic activation of nitrosamines. We conducted a population-based case- control study among 341 incident lung cancer cases and 456 controls of Caucasian, Japanese, or Hawaiian origin. In-person interviews collected detailed information on lifestyle risk factors, and DNA extracted from peripheral leukocytes was used in PCR-based genotyping assays. Logistic regression analyses were used to compute odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for each cell type, adjusting for smoking and dietary variables. The presence of at least one copy of the CYP1A1 MspI variant allele was found to be associated with a 2.4-fold (95% CI, 1.2-4.7) increase in the risk of SCC when this gene was considered singly and a 3.1-fold (95% CI, 1.2-7.9) increase in the risk of SCC when combined with a GSTM1 deletion. No significant association was found between MspI and all lung cancers or other cell types or with the CYP1A1 exon 7 polymorphism. In contrast, the CYP2E1 RsaI and DraI polymorphisms were not clearly related to SCC risk, but these homozygous variant genotypes were associated with a 10-fold (95% CI, 0.0-0.5) decrease in the risk of overall lung cancer (RsaI variant) and AC (DraI variant) compared to the homozygous wild-type genotypes.

The plant communities were grown either at ambient (350 ppm) or elevated (600 ppm) CO2 concentrations. Leaves of T. repens and P. vulgaris grown in elevated atmospheric CO2 had a lower specific leaf area, and leaves of T. repens had lower percentage N on a dry weight basis than leaves grown under ambient CO2 concentration.

The species-specific feeding intensity of juvenile H. pomatia did not differ between the two treatments. The total dry weight of T. repens consumed by the snails was marginally greater (P = 0.06) at elevated CO2, but there were no significant differences in leaf N or leaf area eaten. These findings are similar to numerous other studies showing that invertebrates increase their consumption of plant material to balance reductions in plant N concentrations at elevated CO2.

Helix pomatia that fed on plants grown at elevated CO2 atmosphere showed a larger increase in relative wet weight than those that fed on plants from ambient CO2 conditions. However, the weight gain of H. pomatia was poorly correlated with amount of plant tissue consumed, so we suggest that the effect of CO2 on weight gain in H. pomatia was due to a change in the quality of T. repens leaves.","Elevated carbon dioxide; Food choice; Helix pomatia; Herbivory; Trifolium repens","carbon dioxide enrichment; feeding behaviour; land snail; leaf area; nitrogen; Jura Mountains; Switzerland; Bromus erectus; Bromus erectus; Gastropoda; Helix pomatia; Helix pomatia; Hieracium pilosella; Hieracium pilosella; Prunella vulgaris; Prunella vulgaris; Trifolium repens; Trifolium repens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031896646

Several major classes of POP's, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH's), chlorobenzenes, chlorinated dioxins and chlorinated furans, have been identified as products of incomplete combustion (PIC's) produced in trace levels in combustion systems. A wide variety of combustion processes, ranging from power plants, industrial boilers, industrial furnaces and incinerators, to home heating devices, are believed to be potential sources of POP's. Full-scale combustion facilities can be significant sources of POP's due to the large mass flow of flue gas released from a plant. Total emissions of POP's from small combustion devices, such as wood stoves and residential oil furnaces, can also be significant due to the large numbers of existing units near high population areas. It becomes increasingly important to understand the formation of POP's from different combustion processes to identify sources of POP's and to develop strategies for their prevention and mitigation. Research on POP emissions from combustion sources conducted by EPA is largely driven by the need for regulating the emissions of hazardous air pollutants as required by Title III of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments and by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. This paper provides a summary of EPA's research on emissions and control of POP's from combustion sources with emphasis on source characterization and measurement, formation and destruction mechanisms, formation prevention and flue gas cleaning. Laboratory experiments conducted to examine the PAH emissions from a wide variety of combustion processes, ranging from pulverized coal utility boilers to wood stoves, have shown that they exhibit widely different emission characteristics. Waste incineration research conducted by the National Risk Management Research Laboratory, Air Pollution Prevention and Control Division (NRMRL/APPCD) has also shown that complex mechanisms, including physical mixing and chemical kinetics, are involved in the formation of chlorinated PIC's. Research has also indicated that the formation of ultra-trace levels of chlorinated-dioxins and -furans in combustion/incineration processes includes the complex interaction of several factors including temperature, chlorine content and catalyst. The beneficial effect of sulfur and sorbents for dioxin formation prevention is demonstrated. This Laboratory's effort to develop and evaluate state-of-the-art technologies for on-line measurements of PAH's, volatile PIC's, dioxins and furans is also discussed. The promising potential of applying artificial-intelligence-based control systems for improving combustion processes operating conditions as a POP prevention approach is demonstrated. © 1998 Elsevier B.V.

These diagrams provide a petrogenetic framework for magmatic processes from mantle to deep crust, with particular reference to the melting products of carbonate peridotite and the paths of crystallization of carbonated silicate magmas toward carbonatite magmas, with or without the intervention of silicate-carbonate liquid immiscibility. Three key features control these processes: (1) the liquidus surface bounding the silicate-carbonate liquid miscibility gap, (2) the silicate-carbonate liquidus boundary surface which separates the liquidus volume for primary silicates from that for primary carbonates, and (3) the curve of intersection of these two surfaces (1 and 2) which defines the coprecipitation of silicates and calcite with coexisting immiscible silicate- and carbonate-rich liquids. The geometrical arrangement of the two surfaces varies as a function of both pressure and bulk composition (e.g. with Si/Al, Na/K, Mg/Fe). Surface (2) is the locus of initial liquids from partial melting of carbonate-silicate assemblages, and the limit for residual liquid compositions derived fnm silicate-CO3 liquids. The carbonate liquidus volume is a forbidden region for carbonate-rich magmas derived from silicate magmas at the pressures investigated. The immiscible liquids dissolve no more than 80 wt % CaCO3, and the miscibility gap (MG) becomes smaller with increasing Mg/Ca. Extrapolation of experimental data indicates that the MG disappears with more than ∼50 wt % (MgO + FeO*) at 1.0 GPa for the compositions investigated. The distance between the miscibility gap, surface (1), and the silicate-carbonate liquidus surface, surface (2), increases significantly with increasing (MgO + FeO*). This observation, coupled with knowledge of the phase boundaries in the system, allows comparisons with projected rock compositions, and this permits the following conclusions. Calciocarbonatites and natrocarbonatites are excluded as candidates for primary magmas from the mantle, which must have compositions dominated by calcic dolomite. The formation of (equilibrium) carbonate-rich liquids immiscible with silicate magmas in the mantle is unlikely, which denies the formation of CaCO3 ocelli in mantle xenoliths as immiscible liquids. Immiscible carbonate-rich magmas separated from many silicate magmas may tend to be concentrated mar calciocarbonatite compositions, with maximum CaCO3 75-80 wt %, low (MgO + FeO*), and (Na,K)2CO3 near 15 wt %. Silicate parents with higher Na/Ca and peralkalinity may yield immiscible magmas approaching natrocarbonatite compositions. Exsolution of immiscible carbonate-rich magma occurs without the coprecipitation of calcite except along the limiting field boundary (3). Only after the carbonate-rich magma is physically separated from the parent magma, and cooled with the precipitation of silicates, does it reach the silicate-carbonate field boundary and precipitate cumulate carbonatites, with inevitable enrichment of residual liquids in alkalis. Calciocarbonatite magmas cannot be derived from natrocarbonatite magmas. Dolomitic carbonatite magmas cannot be formed by liquid immiscibiltty, but only by fractionation of calciocarbonatites (according to CaCO3-MgCO3), or as primary magmas.","CaCO3 ocelli; Carbonatite; Liquid immiscibility; Nephelinite","carbonatite; geochemistry; petrogenesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031874134

The last term, unaccounted for in previous studies of surface-air exchanges, becomes important over tall vegetation and at times when the vertical gradient of the atmospheric constituent (̄C(r) - (1/Z(r)) ∫(Zr)/0 ̄cdz) is large, as is the case with CO2 in forests at night. Experimental evidence is presented to support the postulation that the mass flow component is in large part responsible for the large run-to-run variations in eddy fluxes, the lack of energy balance closure and the apparent low eddy fluxes at night under stable stratifications. Three mechanisms causing the non-zero mean vertical velocity are discussed. Of these, drainage flow on undulating terrain is the most important one for long-term flux observations because only a small terrain slope is needed to trigger its occurrence. It is suggested from the data obtained at a boreal deciduous forest that without proper account of the mass flow component, the assessment of annual uptake of CO2 could be biased significantly towards higher values. It is argued that quantifying the mass flow component is a major challenge facing the micrometeorological community.","CO2; Drainage; Forest; Net ecosystem exchange","atmosphere/vegetation interaction; micrometeorology; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031812295

It varies in both time and space. Spatial changes in erosion rates due to variations in lithology are illustrated by contrasting rates of drainage divide migration away from faults of known ages. Time variations in relative sediment supply are extremely complex and vary widely according to the direction and magnitude of climate change. In many parts of the Great Basin and south-western USA, glacial maximum climates were characterized by higher effective moisture and the altitudinal downward spread of woodds and forests. Sparse data from alluvial fans indicate reduced sediment supply, despite the increased runoff evident from higher lake levels. The situation in Mediterranean areas is less clear, with rival climatic scenarios for vegetation ecotypes predicting contrasting runoff. In order to test these latter we run Cumulative Seasonal Erosion Potential [CSEP] experiments for present-day and a variety of full-glacial Mediterranean candidate climates. The results indicate the likelihood of enhanced sediment supply and runoff compared to the present day during full-glacial times for a cool wet winter climate and a reduction in sediment supply and runoff for a full-glacial cool dry winter climate. We then explore the consequences of such phase differences in sediment supply, and sea and lake levels for the stratigraphy of sedimentary basins. Highstands and lowstands of sea or lake may be accompanied by greater or lesser sediment and water supply, as determined by the regional climate and the direction of climatic change. Thus marine lowstands are not necessarily periods of great transfer of coarse clastic sediments to shelves and deep water basinal environments. Unsteady sediment supply has greatest implications for alluvial systems, in particular the effect that changing relative supplies of water and sediment have upon river and fan channel incision.",,"basin analysis; sediment supply; stratigraphy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031692621

Regulations based on demonstrated concentrations of specific chemicals, and risk assessments with inherent limitations and uncertainties, are the current methods of preventing exposure to 'unsafe' emission levels.

This study reports findings from a symptom survey conducted in Midlothian, Texas, which adds to the limited but growing body of knowledge showing that persons living near cement kilns are experiencing increased respiratory effects. This cross- sectional study uses randomized sampling and an extensive health questionnaire, covering 12 physiological systems, to determine differences in reported health symptoms between the study community (Midlothian, Texas, n = 58) and the reference community (Waxahachie, Texas, n = 54). Findings indicate significant elevations in reported respiratory symptoms in the study community (p-value 0.002). Although the comparatively small sample size is a limitation, the fact that only 'respiratory effects' were highly significant supports the efficacy of this investigation. Respiratory effects would be the major anticipated outcome from the known exposures under investigation. This specificity of response (i.e., elevation in respiratory symptoms only), indicates that 'response bias' was not a significant factor in this study.","Cement industry emissions; Community health study; Environmental epidemiology; Hazardous wastes incineration; Particulate pollution; Respiratory health effects","cement; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollution; article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; health; human; incineration; male; questionnaire; randomized controlled trial; respiratory tract disease; risk assessment; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032424709

In contrast to other studies which have been based on a baseline concept, this study proceeds from a base year concept in order to determine emission reductions and their costs. Climate protection expenditure will be calculated as a regionally differentiated, intertemporal trajectory. This results from a macroeconomic extension of a fuzzy optimIzation model including a new climate protection cost function. Climate change impacts are considered implicitly within a boundary concept. Then, a climate stabilization scenario based on a control function will be demonstrated; its economic implications and some policy-making aspects will be discussed.","Climate policy-making; Climate protection expenditure; Fuzzy optimization","climate change; cost function; environmental economics; greenhouse; methodology; policy making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032104566

For example, recurvature is captured poorly by forecast models and can produce excessively large position errors. This study addresses the problem of hurricane track forecasting in three ways. First, the initial conditions for the forecast model are augmented by a dense coverage of high spatial and temporal resolution satellite-derived wind vectors. Second, to gauge the extent to which this additional four-dimensional detail of the atmospheric structure can be exploited, three distinct types of data assimilation methods are examined. These are 1) conventional (intermittent, cycled) 6-h assimilation, 2) nudging over a 12- or 24-h period up to the initial time, and 3) recently developed barotropic and four-dimensional variational assimilation schemes, also over a 12- or 24-h period. The nudging and variational methods are continuous assimilation procedures and incorporate satellite-derived winds, typically at 6-h frequencies, but up to hourly frequencies in trials over the Australian region. Over the Atlantic basin, only a 6-h frequency of high-density satellite-derived wind vectors was available for the 1995 season. Third, a very high-resolution (15 km) semi-implicit. semi-Lagrangian model provided forecasts out to 72 h. The present study describes the direct application to the Atlantic basin, for the specific case of Hurricane Opal, of data assimilation and prediction procedures developed for tropical cyclones over the Australian Pacific basin. A series of forecasts was made, from the two initial times 0000 and 1200 UTC 2 October 1995. respectively. In these cases, where CLIPER (climatology and persistence) and other conventional forecast guidance was poor, the nudging and variational assimilation procedures, which were those that best utilized the high spatial and temporal resolution satellite-derived winds, produced greatly improved forecasts.",,"cyclone; hurricane; satellite sensing; storm track; tropical cyclone; weather forecasting; Atlantic Pacific",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031697782

During that period green area index ranged from 1.8 to 4.5 for the fertilised crop and from 1.0 to 2.7 for the control crop. Excellent agreement was obtained between simulations and measurements for fluxes of net radiation, latent heat and CO2, although sensible heat fluxes were less satisfactory. Uncertainties in estimates for fluxes of water vapour and CO2 from the underlying soil contributed to discrepancies between measurements and simulations. Modelled canopy fluxes of both CO2 and latent heat are highly sensitive to the quantum yield of photosynthesis (μmol CO2 mol-1 quanta). Fluxes of latent heat are more sensitive than CO2 to parameters describing stomatal function, while CO2 flux was more sensitive than transpiration to maximum carboxylation rates. The two-leaf model requires only a few parameters that may vary with plant species. It is computationally 10 times more efficient than an earlier described multilayered model and is suited for incorporation into regional- or global-scale climate models.",,"atmosphere/vegetation interaction; canopy conductance; energy flux; photosynthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031812297

The following fuel feed compositions were examined: 100% coal, 75-25% and 50-50% coal and tire blends, as well as 100% tire. Coal and tire particles were in the size ranges of 63-75 and 180-212 μm, respectively. Combustion of cylindrical streams of particles took place under steady flow conditions, in an electrically-heated drop-tube furnace in air, at a gas temperature of 1150°C and a particle heating rate of ≈ 105°C/s. The bulk equivalence ratio, φ, in the furnace was varied in the range of 0.5 to 2, by varying the particle mass loading. Combustion observations on burning clouds of particles were conducted with simultaneous pyrometry and cinematography. Interparticle flame interactions were visually observed mostly in the near-stoichiometric and fuel-rich regions. Volatile flame interactions were apparent at a lower φ for tire crumb particles than for coal particles and became progressively more intense with increasing φ, until, at sufficiently high φs large group flames formed for tire particles. As particle flame interactions increased, average maximum temperatures in the flame decreased. Coal particles resisted the formation of group flames, even at high φs. Such observations correlated with the trends observed for the PAH emissions of the two fuels, those of tire crumb being much higher than those of coal and commencing at a lower φ. A certain degree of stratification in the combustion of blends of particles of the two fuels was observed. This kept the PAH emissions at levels much lower than those expected based on the weighted average emissions of the two fuels. NOx emissions from tires were much lower than those of coal, while those of the blends were close to the weighted average emissions. Combustion of fuel blends in the two aforementioned particle size cuts, generated the lowest NOx emissions when the small coal particles were combined with either the small or the large tire particles. SO2 emissions from the blends were found to be close to the weighted average emissions of the two fuels. Blending coal with tire reduced the CO2 emissions of coal but increased the CO emissions. CO emissions were significant only in the fuel-rich region. Tire ash was of similar size and shape as the parent tire particles themselves. To the contrary the ash of coal was polydisperse, including large cenospheres and tiny particle fragments. Particulate emissions (soot and ash), measured in the range of 0.4 to 8 μm, increased with φ. Generally, tire produced more mass of submicron particulates than coal.

Stepwise multiple regression revealed that depth, latitude, sediment organic-carbon content and bottom-water oxygen concentration are significant factors that together explained 52-87% of the variation in macrobenthic species richness (E[s100]), the Shannon-Wiener index (H'), dominance (D), and evenness (J'). Percent sand and percent clay were not significant factors. After removal of depth and latitudinal effects, oxygen and organic-carbon concentrations combined accounted for 47, 67, 52 and 32% of residual variation in macrobenthic E(s100), H', D, and J', respectively. Organic carbon exhibited a stronger relationship than oxygen to measures of community evenness, and appeared to have more explanatory power for polychaetes than total macrobenthos. When only stations with oxygen &lt; 1 ml l-1 were considered, oxygen concentration became the dominant parameter after depth. Results suggest existence of an oxygen threshold (&lt; 0.45 ml l-1), above which oxygen effects on macrobenthic diversity are minor relative to organic matter influence, but below which oxygen becomes a critical factor. Our regression results lead us to hypothesize that for bathyal faunas, oxygen at low concentrations has more influence on species richness, while organic carbon regulates the distribution of individuals among species (community evenness). Examination of rarefaction curves for Indo-Pacific stations reveals that total macrobenthos, polychaetes, crustaceans and molluscs all exhibit reduced species richness within oxygen minimum zones (OMZs). However, representation under conditions of hypoxia varies among taxa, with polychaetes being most tolerant. Molluscs and crustaceans often (but not always) exhibit few individuals and species in OMZs, and sometimes disappear altogether, contributing to reduced macrobenthic diversity and elevated dominance in these settings. The linear negative relationship observed between bathyal species richness and sediment organic-carbon content (used here as a proxy for food availability) may represent the right side (more productive half) of the hump-shaped, diversity-productivity curve reported in other systems. These analyses suggest there are potentially strong influences of organic matter and oxygen on the diversity and composition of bathyal macrobenthos, especially in the Indo-Pacific Ocean.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031871172

We estimate that improved agricultural management and wasteland reclamation have the potential to sequester an additional 1.9 Tg CO2-C y-1 or more, largely through increasing productivity and C inputs to soils and conversion of wasteland to agricultural production. We estimate that current forestry activities in the region could sequester about 7 Tg CO2-C y-1. There is also a large potential for increased C sequestration and fossil fuel offsets by conversion of wasteland to fuel wood plantations, on the order of 30-70 Tg C y-1.

K1A 0Y7, Canada","This study addresses the impact of absorbing aerosols on the solar surface radiation budget (SSRB) and on the inference of cloud absorption using multiple global datasets. The data pertain to the radiation budgets at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), at the surface, and to precipitation and tropical biomass burning. Satellite-based SSRB data were derived from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment and the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Program using different inversion algorithms. A manifestation of the aerosol effect emerges from a zonal comparison between satellite-based and surface-observed SSRB, which shows good agreement in most regions except over the tropical continents active in biomass burning. Another indication arises from the variation of the ratio of cloud radiative forcing at the TOA and at the surface, which was used in many recent studies addressing the cloud absorption problem. The author's studies showed that the ratio is around unity under most circumstances except when there is heavy urban/industrial pollution or fires. These exceptions register discrepancy between observed and modeled SSRB. The discrepancy is found to increase with decreasing cloudiness, implying that it has more to do with the treatment of aerosols than clouds, although minor influences by other factors may also exist. The largest discrepancy is observed in the month of minimal cloud cover and maximal aerosol loading. The corresponding maximum monthly mean aerosol optical thickness is estimated to be around 1.0 by a parameterization developed in this study. After the effects of aerosols on SSRB are accounted for using biomass burining and precipitation data, disagreements no longer exist between the theory and observation with regard to the transfer of solar radiation. It should be pointed out that the tropical data employed in this study are limited to a small number of continental sites.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002903547

In the U.S., waste-to-energy plants are called Municipal Waste Combustors (MWCs). Control technologies that were developed in Germany in the 1990's became very elaborate and often uses up to five control stages. In the U.S., simpler systems were developed based on the German experience that incorporated good control technologies on a cost-effective basis. Today in Germany, it is common to find disposal fees at MWCs in the range of $150 to $350/ton. This is due to the high cost of air pollution control systems and the lack of competition from landfills. In the U.S., there are many landfills available with disposal fees less than $32/ton that compete with MWCs for waste. Therefore, U.S. MWCs had to implement control technologies that meet world recognized standards for dioxin and mercury emissions at cost competitive bases as well as considering local economics when selecting control technologies. The use of carbon-based technologies is effective in controlling emissions. In addition, a new technology sodium tetra sulfide, is being considered to reduce mercury emissions.

The driving force behind changes in technologies for the incineration of hazardous and municipal waste is the changing regulatory climate. More stringent regulations create the need for better understanding of all aspects of the combustion process. In this review, case studies are employed to demonstrate how recent advances in combustion have impacted the design and operation of incinerators, with special emphasis on pollutant minimization, process upsets, and system simulations. The three topics covered under pollutant minimization are methods for complying with proposed incinerator emission standards for dioxins and furans, the interaction of NOx and chlorine in incinerators, and the environmental impact of solid residues from incinerators. The topics under process upsets include the failure of trial burns to cover emissions during upsets, such as emergency shutdowns, and estimation and measurement strategies. The final topic provides illustrations of how numerical simulations of combustion systems have advanced to the point where they can be used as engineering tools to design trial burns, optimize facility operation, and study the consequences of extreme operating conditions that cannot be tested in practice. The review concludes with identification of future topics in combustion research as suggested by additional issues of concern to incinerator operators.",,"Air pollution control; Chlorine; Computer simulation; Hazardous materials; Laws and legislation; Nitrogen oxides; Refuse incinerators; Standards; Municipal wastes; Refuse incineration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032274453

Many petroleum refineries blend methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) with gasoline to make oxygenated fuel, which bums cleaner and reduces carbon monoxide emissions from motor vehicle exhaust. MTBE has a low acute toxicity ranking and is only mildly irritating to the eyes and skin. Excessive acute vapor inhalation causes depression of the central nervous system. Limited animal data indicate that MTBE may increase the risk of cancer, although this has not been adequately addressed. This assessment was conducted to monitor airborne MTBE occupational exposure to petroleum refinery and transport loading rack facility employees at one location. The 47 time-weighted average (TWA) and short-term exposure limit (STEL) personal air samples collected did not exceed the American Industrial Hygiene Association workplace environmental exposure level of 100 ppm for an 8-hour TWA. The 38 personal STEL samples collected ranged from <0.896 to 35.012 ppm with a geometric mean of 2.44 ppm. The nine personal TWA samples ranged from <0.042 to 1.750 ppm with a geometric mean of 0.58 ppm. This study found that minimal occupational exposures to MTBE occurred when fugitive emissions from operating equipment were limited, leaks and spills during product transfer were minimized, and mechanical equipment was thoroughly depressurized and purged before allowing the equipment to be repaired. © 1998, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.

As an aid in understanding how these species protect nitrogenase, we have developed an immunofluorescence technique coupled to light microscopy (IF-LM) with which intact cyanobacteria can be immunolabeled and the distribution patterns of nitrogenase and other proteins can be described and semiquantified. Chilled ethanol was used to fix the cells, which were subsequently made permeable to antibodies by using dimethyl sulfoxide. Use of this technique demonstrated that about 3 to 20 cells (mean ± standard deviation, 9 ± 4) consecutively arranged in a Trichodesmium trichome were labeled with the nitrogenase antibody. The nitrogenase-containing cells were distributed more frequently around the center of the trichome and were rarely found at the ends. On average 15% of over 300 randomly encountered cells examined contained nitrogenase. The percentage of nitrogenase-containing cells (nitrogenase index [NI]) in an exponential culture was higher early in the light period than during the rest of the light-dark cycle, while that for a stationary culture was somewhat constant at a lower level throughout the light-dark cycle. The NI was not affected by treatment of the cultures with the photosynthetic inhibitor dichloro 1,3'-dimethyl urea or with low concentrations of ammonium (NH4Cl). However, incubation of cultures with 0.5 μM NH4Cl over 2 days reduced the NI. The IF technique combined with 14C autoradiography showed that the CO2 fixation rate was lower in nitrogenase- containing cells. The results of the present study suggest that (i) the IF- LM technique may be a useful tool for in situ protein localization in cyanobacteria, (ii) cell differentiation occurs in Trichodesmium and only a small fraction of cells in a colony have the potential to fix nitrogen, (iii) the photosynthetic activity (CO2 uptake) is reduced if not absent in N2- fixing cells, and (iv) variation in the NI may be a modulator of nitrogen- fixing activity.",,"nitrogenase; antibody labeling; article; autoradiography; cell differentiation; Cyanobacterium; hypothesis; immunofluorescence; nitrogen fixation; oxygen consumption; photosynthesis; protein localization; statistical analysis; Cyanobacteria; Trichodesmium; Trichodesmium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031927944

With a cost-effectiveness analysis it will be possible to address the question: which measures are the most cost-efficient from the environmental point-of-view, i.e. in this case, which measures yield the highest reductions of the carbon dioxide exhausts per Swedish Krona spent? Many measures, whose costs mainly consist of administrative surveillance costs, yield the highest cost-efficiency - and well below the present target of 0.05 ECU per kg of CO2. Such highly cost-efficient measures are: improved traffic signals (highest cost-efficiency of all studied measures); road pricing schemes (of various types); traffic calming measures; car pooling incentives in terms of High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Cost effectiveness; Environmental impact; Exhaust gases; Gas emissions; Traffic signals; Urban planning; Car pooling; Road pricing; Traffic calming; Motor transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032257788

N2L 3G1, Canada","The most important tin mineralization in Thailand is associated with the Late Cretaceous to Middle Tertiary western Thai granite belt. A variety of deposit types are present, in particular pegmatite, vein and greisen styles of mineralization. A feature common to most of the deposits is that they are associated with granites that were emplaced into the Khang Krachan Group, which consists of poorly sorted, carbonaceous, pelitic metasediments. Most of the deposits contain low to moderately saline aqueous fluid inclusions and aqueous-carbonic inclusions with variable CH4/CO2 ratios. Low salinity aqueous inclusions represent trapped magmatic fluid in at least one case, the Nong Sua pegmatite, based on their occurrence as primary inclusions in magmatic garnet. Aqueous-carbonic inclusions are commonly secondary and neither the CO2 nor NaCl contents of these inclusions decrease in progressively younger inclusions, implying that they are not magmatic in origin. Reduced carbon is depleted in the metasediments adjacent to granites and the δD values greisen muscovites are variable, but are as low as -134 ‰, indicative of fluid interaction with organic (graphitic) material. This suggests that the aqueous-carbonic fluid inclusions represent fluids that were produced, at least in part, during contact metamorphism-metasomatism. By comparing the west Thai belt with other Sn-W provinces it is evident that there is a strong correlation between fluid composition and pressure in general. Low to moderately saline aqueous inclusions and aqueous-carbonic inclusions are characteristic of mineralization associated with relatively deep plutonic belts. Mineralized pegmatites are also typically of deeper plutonic belts, and pegmatite-hosted deposits may contain cassiterite that is magmatic (crystallized from granitic melt) or is orthomagmatic-hydrothermal (crystallized from aqueous or aqueous-carbonic fluids) in origin. The magmatic aqueous fluids (those that were exsolved from granitic melts) are interpreted to have had low salinities. As a consequence of the low salinities, tin is partitioned in favour of the melt on vapour saturation. Thus with a high enough degree of fractionation, the crystallization of a magmatic cassiterite (or different Sn phase such as wodginite) is inevitable. Because tin is not partitioned in favour of the vapour phase upon water saturation of the granitic melts, it is proposed that relatively deep vein and greisen systems tend to form by remobilization processes. In addition, many deeper greisen systems are hosted, in part, by carbonaceous pelitic metasediments and the reduced nature of the metasediments may play a key role in remobilizing tin. Sub-volcanic systems by contrast are characterized by high temperature-high salinity fluids. Owing to the high chlorinity, tin is strongly partitioned in favour of the vapour and cassiterite mineralization can form by orthomagmatic-hydrothermal processes. Similar relationships between the depth of emplacement and fluid composition also appear to apply to other types of granite-hosted deposits, such as different types of molybdenum deposits.",,"granite; metallogenesis; mineralization; mineralizing fluid; terrane; tin; Thailand",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031715271

The objective of the workshop was to prepare a holistic assessment of knowledge gaps and research opportunities for presentation at the penultimate session of the colloquium. The workshop reviewed the research progress made since the first PM colloquium (Irvine, California, January 1994) and the findings of recent major reviews of the PM literature by the World Health Organization-European Region, the U.K. Health Department, the National Institute of Public Health in the Netherlands, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. It then discussed (1) the nature of ambient PM, (2) population segments at special risk, (3) the nature of the health effects of concern, (4) the sources of ambient air PM, and (5) the implications of ambient air PM health effects on occupational exposure limits and occupational cohorts. The workshop concluded that: A primary focus for fuaher research should be on accumulation mode aerosol with the objective of disentangling the roles of its chemical constituents, as well as their interactive effects with each other and with coexisting gaseous criteria pollutants. Research is also urgently needed on the health effects of both the coarse-mode PM10 and the ultrafine particles in the nuclei-mode aerosol. There should be a continued focus on infants, the elderly, and people with preexisting cardiopulmonary diseases. Further development and validation of animal models for human sensitive groups warrants high priority. Validated animal models are needed for target human populations in order to investigate: (1) the roles of specific constituents of PM mixtures, (2) the roles of exposure concentrations and durations on responses, (3) some of the risk factors that predispose individuals to be responsive to PM exposures, and (4) physiological, biochemical, molecular, and pathological correlates of mortality, tissue and organ damage, and chronic disease development. © 1998, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

Due to the finite band gap, the Anderson orthogonality does not occur, and thus spectra near the band edge can be calculated without the shakeup contribution. For semiconductors, and not only for metals, we investigate whether the remaining many-particle dynamic exchange effect of the MND model, or so-called replacement, can significantly alter x-ray spectral shapes near the band edge from those obtained from a straightforward final-state rule. For both emission and absorption, in the absence of shakeup, an exact formulation suitable for materials with band structure is discussed. A numerical model for a semiconductor with a 1-eV band gap demonstrates the band-edge modifications, and shows a 50% effect at the band edge, indicating that this dynamic exchange effect can be significant and should be considered in any specific emission or absorption calculation for a semiconductor. Although the ineffectiveness of the orthogonality theorem in semiconductors is emphasized, a suppression near the band edge also remains a possibility.

Meereschemie, P., Bremen, Germany","Within the framework of the Ocean Margin Exchange Programme (OMEX), benthic carbon mineralisation was determined along the Goban Spur shelf-slope transition (200-4500 m water depth) at the eastern margin of the North Atlantic. Carbon oxidation rates were derived from the pore water distributions of oxygen, nitrate, ammonium, dissolved manganese and dissolved iron in combination with fluxes of solutes across the sediment-water interface. Pore water profiles of oxygen were obtained in situ with a benthic lander and on-deck in sediment cores retrieved by multi-coring. With water depths increasing from 200 to 1500 m benthic carbon oxidation rates decreased from 4.3 to 1.5 mmol C m-2 d-1, while the interfacial organic carbon concentrations increased from 0.2 to 0.7% (wt/wt). At stations deeper than 1500 m, no further trends with depth were found. Carbon burial efficiencies in this low-sedimentation continental margin were not related to water depth and ranged between 0.8 and 2.3%. We conclude from these data that there is no distinct carbon depocenter at the Goban Spur continental slope, this in contrast to the slope at the western North Atlantic margin (Anderson, Rowe, Kemp, Trumbore, and Biscaye (1994). Carbon budget of the Middle Atlantic Bight. Deep-Sea Research 1, 41, 669-703.). Integrated carbon mineralisation rates indicated that oxic respiration accounted for more than 70% of the total carbon oxidation at all stations. Substantial anoxic mineralisation was identified only on the upper slope, while the contribution of denitrification never exceeded 10% along the entire transect. Benthic oxygen fluxes showed no direct response to pulses of organic material settling on the sea floor, as appearing in sediment traps, suggesting that the organic material deposited is dominated by refractory compounds. This finding was supported by steady-state modelling of pore water oxygen profiles which showed that the organic matter being mineralised at stations deeper than 200 m had very low degradation rate constants (&lt; 1 y-1). Comparison of the measured oxygen and nutrient fluxes with the diffusive fluxes calculated from pore water profiles indicated that within the experimental errors there was no significant contribution by bioirrigating organisms to the sediment-water exchange fluxes.",,"Europe; burial (geology); continental margin; mineralization; organic carbon; sediment chemistry; Atlantic Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032409594

The study involves 25 industrial case studies assessing technology options to reduce cO2 emissions. Individual cases are assessed based upon standard project appraisal techniques as well as on global and local environmental benefits associated with the project. It is found that the energy conservation projects considered here typically have high rates of return. Thirteen of the 24 cases for which environmental benefits were calculated had negative costs per ton of cO2 emission reduction. In addition, 19 of 24 cases had a positive net benefit per ton of CO2 emission reduction. The study suggests that targeted investments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can produce a large number of no-regrets outcomes.

Since Venus can be regarded as a planet-wide large igneous province, we can expect large quantities of CO2 being transferred into its atmosphere via volcanic outgassing. We have quantified the maximum possible amount of CO2 that can be outgassed via a single massive episode of resurfacing of the planet. This figure (5.6 x 1019 kg of CO2) is about 8 times smaller than the total CO2 present in the Venusian atmosphere (4.55 x 1020 kg CO2). The lack of planet-wide, efficient mechanisms for the recycling of CO2 on Venus indicates that CO2 has progressively accumulated in the atmosphere.

The project was initiated in response to public concerns regarding the operations of a chemical waste incinerator located in the area and was undertaken by a multidisciplinary team based at the University of East Anglia. Sampling was carried out around a number of industrial facilities in the Panteg district and involved a variety of environmental compartments (e.g. soil, grass, air, milk, eggs, poultry and vegetables). The results provided evidence of some unusual environmental contamination in a strip of land 200 m wide around the eastern boundary of the incineration plant. Fugitive emissions from the site appeared to be substantially responsible for this situation and exposure calculations indicated that eggs were potentially the major source of higher PCB and PCDD/DF intakes. Since the start of the project substantial alterations have been made to the incinerator and, overall, the research does seem to have resolved a number of uncertainties and helped to reduce local concerns.","Dioxins; Exposure assessment; Industrial sources; PCBs; Waste incineration","Dioxins; Exposure assessment; Fugitive emissions; Contamination; Industrial emissions; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Risk assessment; Sampling; Toxic materials; Waste incineration; Chemical wastes; dioxin; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; dioxin; environmental assessment; incineration; industrial district; PCB; pollution monitoring; air pollution; chemical waste; conference paper; egg; environmental monitoring; food contamination; geographic distribution; grass; incineration; industrialization; milk; pollution control; poultry; soil pollution; United Kingdom; vegetable; United Kingdom",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032143981

Clearly the sensitivity of different ecosystems to certain pollutants varies widely across Europe and so it follows that a more cost-effective way of minimising environmental damage is by selectively reducing the emissions in certain countries and regions. To this end integrated assessment models where used to help formulate the second sulphur protocol [UN-ECE EB.AIR/R.84, 1994] which derived cost-effective strategies for reducing SO2 emissions from coal-fired power stations across Europe. In this current work similar methodologies where used to derive abatement strategies for the heavily polluted Black Triangle region of eastern Europe, i.e. the region contained along the mutual borders of Poland, Germany and the Czech Republic. This work was performed at a much finer resolution than that used during the UN-ECE work, such that specific emission sources could be identified for abatement. The integrated assessment models developed for this work used either critical loads maps, land use maps and population data to identify the ecosystems and people most exposed to air pollution. The models where developed so as to be fully integrated within a geographical information system (GIS), so that data inputs and model results could be easily analysed and displayed. Such a system provides a means whereby policy makers can easily devise and compare emission abatement strategies for the Black Triangle region.","Air pollutants; Ecosystems; Emissions","Emission abatement strategies; Integrated assessment models; Air pollution control; Cost effectiveness; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; International cooperation; Mathematical models; Risk assessment; Sulfur dioxide; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; assessment method; atmospheric pollution; emission control; international agreement; policy strategy; pollution policy; sulfur dioxide; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution control; conference paper; czech republic; ecosystem; europe; germany; information system; poland; pollution transport; Czech Republic; Germany; Poland",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032142889

Raman scattering accompanied by the analogous two-exciton recombination (or creation) is also analyzed. The excess momentum equal to the change of the electromagnetic field momentum in these processes can be transferred to phonons or impurities. The processes under consideration take place if there is Bose condensation in the interacting exciton system, and, therefore, can be used as a method to reveal exciton Bose condensation. If the frequency of the incident light (Formula presented) is the frequency corresponding to the recombination of an exciton with p=0), the coherent two-exciton recombination with the excess momentum elastically transferred to impurities leads to the appearance of the spectral line (Formula presented) corresponding to the induced two-photon emission.

Threshold values of these indicator species and ratios, delineating the transition between VOC and NOx sensitivity, were proposed. Subsequently, measurement studies have assumed the unversality of these threshold criteria and have compared local observed indicators with previously established criteria to assess ozone sensitivities. In this study the concept of indicator species is extended to combinations of observable species that are consistently associated with different site characteristics (eg ozone sensitivities and emissions features). The results of SARMAP Air Quality Models (SAQM) simulations in the San Joaquin Valley, California, are used to investigate the applicability of indicators to assess ozone sensitivities and emissions features. The use of three indicator ratios (O3/NOy-NOx), HCHO/NOy and H2O2/HNO3) along with SAQM-derived threshold criteria is found to be effective for identifying VOC-or NOx-sensitive regimes. NOy and (NOy-NOx)/NOy are found to be useful in describing emission features and threshold criteria are derived by SAQM prediction. SAQM-derived threshold criteria for assesing ozone sensitivities are found to differ from threshold critera proposed by previous studies using different models and under different conditions. Such differences suggest that threshold criteria are likely to be dependent on locations and environmental conditions, including emission patterns and rates. Therefore local observed indicator species and ratios can be used to determine ozone sensitivities only if appropriate threshold criteria have been derived for the local conditions.",,"air quality; nitrogen oxides; ozone; California; San Joaquin Valley; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000961759

Higher CO2 accelerates photosynthesis. Forest productivity may increase substantially in some regions. For example, growth rates of well-managed southern pines may increase by 20 percent over the next fifty years if climate doesn't change and if CO2 concentrations continue to increase. Models of climate change and its potential effects on forests include many untested assumptions. Environmental advocacy groups often assert that restrictions on forest management help control atmospheric CO2. They cite studies showing that a no-harvest regime can maximize carbon storage on isolated tracts of unmanaged forest. A more thorough analysis indicates that active management is usually a better strategy than preservation. Prohibiting harvest on selected areas (e.g., on federal lands in the Northwest) may provide no overall increase in forest carbon stocks because harvest activity will shift to other regions. Broad restrictions on harvest would eliminate economic incentives for forest management and encourage conversion of forest lands to other uses. Active forest management can significantly increase the productivity and carbon storage capacity of land. It also provides raw material for essential products that store significant amounts of carbon. Moreover, forest products often require less fossil energy to manufacture than non-renewable alternatives.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Environmental protection; Harvesting; Laws and legislation; Photosynthesis; Renewable energy resources; Abstract only; Carbon storage capacity; Forest management; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031638188

By unamended bioassays containing sediment and groundwater, 37 samples were investigated with respect to methane production, sulfate, iron, and manganese reduction, and denitrification. Methane production was restricted to the most reduced part of the plume with rates of 0.003-0.055 nmol CH4/g dry weight/day. Sulfate reduction was observed at rates of maximum 1.8 nmol SO42-/g dry weight/day along with methane production in the plume, but sulfate reduction was also observed further downgradient of the landfill. Iron reduction at rates of 5-19 nmol Fe(II)/g dry weight/day was observed in only a few samples, but this may be related to a high detection limit for the iron reducing bioassay. Manganese reduction at rates of maximum 2.4 nmol Mn(II)/g dry weight/day and denitrification at rates of 0.2-37 nmol N2O-N/g dry weight/day were observed in the less reduced part of the plume. All the redox processes were microbial processes. In many cases, several redox processes took place simultaneously, but in all samples one process dominated accounting for more than 70% of the equivalent carbon conversion. The bioassays showed that the redox zones in the plume identified from the groundwater composition (e.g. as methanogenic and sulfate reducing) locally hosted also other redox processes (e.g. iron reduction). This may have implications for the potential of the redox zone to degrade trace amounts of organic chemicals and suggests that unamended bioassays may be an important supplement to other approaches in characterizing the redox processes in an anaerobic plume.

It is found that the limiting current obtained from the electrostatic approximation is valid only in the deeply nonrelativistic regime. For injection energy as low as 30 keV, the transients in the injected current may produce an inductive voltage that can significantly lower the limiting current from the classical, electrostatic value. Although the source of the virtual cathode is transient in nature, the virtual cathode formed due to this inductive voltage persists long after the injected current has reached a steady-state value. The selfmagnetic field is unimportant, however, at this low energy. This result has implications for scaling devices with rapid current rise times to weakly nonrelativistic energies as well as for ParticleIn-Cell (PIC) codes which use field emission models with electric field thresholds. © 1998 IEEE.","Inductive voltage; PIC; Space-charge limiting current; Virtual cathode","Approximation theory; Computer simulation; Electric space charge; Electrostatics; Energy gap; Limiters; Mathematical models; Transients; Particle in cell (PIC) codes; Cathodes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032098913

The initial increase in hemolymph bicarbonate is stabilized by dehydration to CO2 presumably catalyzed by Carbonic anhydrase (CA) at the basolateral side of the gill epithelium. Thus, an adequate transbranchial gradient of P(co2) is restored. Inhibition of CA with acetazolamide (Az) reduces the rate of CO2 excretion and elevates P(co2). The respiratory acidosis caused by increased P(co2) is compensated by increase in the difference between Na+ and Cl- concentrations. Az does not affect hemolymph ionic concentrations. (2) Ventilatory control: untreated animals show a significant decrease in scaphognathite frequency (F(sc)) during emersion, while Az treated crabs show a slight increase of this variable.

The physical state of LDL was modulated by varying temperature or the triglyceride content of the core. Normal LDL showed an abrupt increase of CE hydrolysis at 24°C and another deviation occurred close to 36°C. 1H-NMR measurements showed that these temperatures coincide with the onset and end temperatures of the LDL core lipid transition, respectively. Enrichment of LDL with triglycerides abolished the abrupt changes both in the CE hydrolysis and in the physical state of LDL lipids. These findings show that there is a correlation between the physical state of LDL lipids and the rate of LAL-mediated hydrolysis of the CEs in the particle. The relative rates of hydrolysis of different CE species were also compared. With native LDL, increasing the length of a saturated acyl chain from 14 to 20 carbons reduced the rate of degradation of CE modestly, while increasing acyl chain unsaturation increased the rate of degradation markedly. However, cholesterol oleate was hydrolyzed more slowly than cholesterol stearate. Essentially the same order of hydrolytic susceptibility was observed when the CE species were incorporated into triglyceride-enriched LDL, reconstituted high density lipoprotein particles or in detergent/phospholipid micelles. These results indicate that the selective hydrolysis of CE species in LDL is determined mainly by the ease with which the CE molecule can emerge from the surface layer reach the active site of LAL. Slower degradation of the more saturated CEs by LAL could lead, under certain conditions, to their accumulation in lysosomes and eventually, to cell death, lysis and deposition of crystalline, poorly mobilizable lipids to the arterial intima.","Acid lipase; Cholesterol ester; Hydrolysis; LDL; Lysosome; Physical state","acid lipase; low density lipoprotein cholesterol; article; enzyme activity; hydrolysis; in vitro study; lipid composition; lipid metabolism; lysosome; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; phase transition; priority journal; temperature; Binding Sites; Cholesterol; Cholesterol Esters; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Fatty Acids; Fibroblasts; Humans; Hydrolysis; Lipase; Lipoproteins, HDL; Lipoproteins, LDL; Lysosomes; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Micelles; Phospholipids; Substrate Specificity; Temperature; Triglycerides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032518880

The effect of CO2 enrichment on total system carbon content did not diminish with time. Increased carbon accumulation occurred despite the development over time of a lower leaf area index and less carbon in the green leaf fraction at high CO2. The extra carbon accumulated at high CO2 in the soil, senesced leaf and leaf litter fractions at all N levels, and in root at high-N, while at low-and mid-N less carbon accumulated in the root fraction at high CO2. The rate of leaf turnover was increased under CO2 enrichment, as indicated by increases in the carbon mass ratio of senesced to green leaf lamina.

The higher soil water contents at high CO2 have important implications for microcosm function, and may have contributed significantly to the increased carbon accumulation at high CO2.

SB 211475 (4-[2-hydroxyl-3-[[2-(2-methoxy-phenoxy)ethyl]amino]propoxyl]-9H-carbazol-3-ol), a hydroxylated carvedilol analogue, is an even more potent antioxidant in several assay systems. Carvedilol also has neuroprotective capacity with modulatory actions at N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and Na+ channels. In the present study, we demonstrated that in cultured rat cerebellar neurons, SB 211475 has 28-fold greater antioxidant activity than carvedilol, but is 2- to 6-fold less potent, respectively, at inhibiting neurotoxic activities at Na+ channels and at NMDA receptor channels. To determine a biophysical rationale for these differential activities, small angle x-ray scattering data were obtained from model lipid and brain membrane bilayers containing either carvedilol, SB 211475, or dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers. Electron density profiles revealed that the location of SB 211475 was restricted to the glycerol backbone/hydrocarbon interface and significantly reduced membrane width by 5%, whereas the time-averaged location for carvedilol and flunarizine also extended to the hydrated surface of the bilayer. Comparison of carvedilol with several dihydropyridines showed a correlation between high ClogP values (lipophilicity), Na+ channel inhibitory potency, and bilayer localization. The antioxidant activity of SB 211475 could be explained by restricted intercalation into the glycerol phosphate/hydrocarbon interface, creating an increase in volume associated with the phospholipid acyl chains, which would then become resistant to lipid peroxidation. Differential channel modulation may also be explained by these membrane structural results, which indicate that carvedilol and the less spatially restricted dihydropyridine molecules are more likely to inhibit transmembrane receptor channels.

Study sites were identical except for differences in the availability of water owing to physical properties of soil profiles and location of sites within the landscape. 2. Abundance of 13C (expressed as δ13C) in wood of trees growing on the drought-prone site (- 24.8‰± 1.4) was greater than in other trees (- 25.8‰±1.2, P&lt;0.001) throughout the 6 years and, with further development, the δ13C signatures of wood may become useful indices of drought-susceptibility in plantations within a few years of establishment. The seasonal pattern of δ13C of wood appeared to reflect seasonal variation in water availability and duration of cambial activity. 3. Basic density of wood of trees growing on the more drought-prone site (496 ± 14.0 kg m-3) was reduced compared to other trees (554 ±5.3 kg m-3, P&lt; 0.001). δ13C of wood across boundaries of growth-rings suggested that drought stopped cambial activity resulting in less production of late wood and less dense wood. 4. The stand growing on the drought-prone site had reduced growth, wood yield and leaf area but identical specific leaf area. Annual growth was correlated with the previous season's rainfall. Together, these results suggested that within the same evaporative climate, drought reduces growth primarily by reducing leaf area and that there is a lag between onset of drought and reduced productivity.","Basic density; Biomass; Carbon isotope discrimination; Leaf area; Water stress","carbon 13; drought stress; growth; leaf; tree ring; Australia; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus globulus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031690281

Peat is both an indigenous and a locally utilised fuel. Finland has no fossil fuel resources, and the transportation distances of imported fuels into Finland are normally long. In Finland the large peat resources can be utilised locally and peat-burning power plants are situated near the peatlands. Peat production and energy conversion methods are being continuously developed to make use of the environmentally and technically best available technology. In Finland peat formation exceeds peat utilisation and an increase in peat utilisation is therefore sustainable. The life cycle assessment concept gives an opportunity to evaluate and improve the environmental quality of peat utilisation options. The study focuses on an inventory analysis, but some of the most common methods of impact assessment with valuation are also included. The study also includes a comparison of fossil fuels and a discussion part. All the calculated results are based on net emissions. The background emissions of natural peatland are subtracted from the emissions of the utilisation phases. Milled peat and sod peat are reported in this study. Horticultural peat is studied simultaneously, but it will be reported later. The Sod Wave, Haku and Tehoturve methods are studied for the production of peat. The power plants of the study are Kempele heating plant and Rauhalahti cogeneration plant. The functional unit is 1 MWh produced total energy. The temporal boundaries vary from 112 to 128 years, depending on the peat production methods used. The restoration time is 100 years in all of the options. The emissions of greenhouse gases are based on the reports of The Finnish Research Programme on Climate Change. The water emissions are based on control monitoring reports from 1994 and 1995. The water emissions of the restoration phase are, however, poorly known at the moment. The Tehoturve method is today the method most commonly used in the production of milled peat, and it is gradually replacing the traditional Haku method. The Tehoturve method is environmentally better than the Haku method. The new Sod Wave method is the best method from the environmental point of view because the production time is shortest. The carbon dioxide emissions of the energy conversion phase make up the biggest share of the total carbon dioxide emissions: well over 90 % of the total amount. Combined heat and power production also gives environmentally better results than separate heat production. The results of the impact assessment mainly follow the inventory results. The airborne emissions of the energy conversion phase cause the biggest acidification and global warming effects. The water emissions of the peat production phase cause the biggest eutrophication effects. In the life cycle assessment the key factors of the peat utilisation options are the definition of boundaries, the life cycle time, the restoration mode and the peat production method used. This study also shows that the assessed restoration way and time give an opportunity to evaluate peat utilisation from different aspects of sustainability.","Environmental technology; Fossil fuels; Life cycle analysis; Peat; Peat production",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5944261058

The volume fraction of retained austenite and austenite carbon content results were then correlated with microstructural changes and impact toughness results. It is shown that the austenite stability is of great significance with respect to impact toughness, and that ferrite, when present in acicular form, can increase the mechanical stability of the austenite. It is observed that decreasing the austenitising temperature increases the driving force for the stage I transformation reaction in which mother austenite transforms to high carbon austenite plus acicular ferrite. However, the austenitising temperature has only a small effect on the kinetics of the stage II reaction in which high carbon austenite transforms to bainitic ferrite plus carbides. In the low silicon iron, austenitising at 950°C results in a continuous network of intercellular and low carbon austenite which reduces impact properties. Intercellular austenite is attributed to the segregation of manganese and high austenitising temperature which decrease the carbon diffusion rate and delay ferrite nucleation and growth. Decreasing the austenitising temperature to 850°C increases the rate of transformation which results in a more uniform microstructure, stable high carbon austenite, and higher impact toughness. Silicon has the effect of modifying the Fe-C phase diagram such that a higher solution treatment temperature is needed to fully austenitise the iron. Furthermore, a three phase region of austenite-ferrite-graphite is introduced in the Fe-C-Si phase diagram. Consequently, austenitising at low solution treatment temperatures produces structures containing proeutectoid ferrite. Increasing the austenitising temperature to 950°C leads to a more uniform acicular microstructure of stable high carbon retained austenite and ferrite and results in optimum impact properties. Following short austempering times in irons containing 2·02% and 3·31% silicon, the carbon content of the retained austenite is low and on subsequent cooling to room temperature it transforms to martensite, resulting in low impact values. Optimum properties are obtained at intermediate austempering periods when both the amount of retained austenite and the austenite carbon content are maximum. Extending the austempering time causes the high carbon austenite to decompose to ferrite plus carbides, the stage II reaction, leading to a reduction in impact toughness.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001647472

Lakes were typically small (median 4.0 ha, 4.5 m deep), rapid flushing, and acid stressed (median pH 5.58, acid-neutalizing capacity (ANC) 7.1 μequiv.·L-1). Forty percent of the lakes declined significantly in SO4, base cations, and Al levels from 1983 to 1995, but only 12 and 16% increased in ANC and pH, respectively. Chemical trends were influenced by local climate; pronounced improvements occurred in response to drought conditions (1986 and 1987), but rapid deterioration followed the wet year in 1988. With more typical precipitation levels since 1989, a pattern of gradual improvement returned. Connected, rapid-flushing lakes, those on low or moderately sensitive bedrock, and peatlands showed the greatest improvements in pH and ANC whereas glacial headwaters and lakes on highly sensitive bedrock showed the least improvement. These results confirm that some recovery continues to occur following local emission reductions. However, many small Sudbury area lakes remain very degraded and unsuitable for acid-sensitive biota. Further emission reductions, including long-range sources, may be necessary to restore chemical conditions to critical levels sufficient to support further biological recovery.",,"acidification; ecosytem recovery; lake water chemistry; sulphur dioxide emission; water quality; Canada; Ontario; Sudbury; cellular organisms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031900758

All of these thiolato complexes were found to undergo carbon-sulfur bond-forming inductive elimination in high yields to form dialkyl sulfides, diaryl sulfides, alkyl aryl sulfides, alkyl alkenyl sulfides, and alkyl alkynyl sulfides. Reductive eliminations forming alkenyl alkyl sulfides and aryl alkyl sulfides were the fastest. Eliminations of alkynyl alkyl sulfides were slower, and elimination of dialkyl sulfide was the slowest. Thus the relative rates for sulfide elimination as a function of the hybridization of the palladium-bound carbon follow the trend sp2 &gt; sp &gt;&gt; sp3. Rates of reductive elimination were faster for cis-chelating phosphine ligands with larger bite angles.

Systematic changes in the electronic properties of the thiolate and aryl groups showed that reductive elimination is the fastest for electron deficient aryl groups and electron rich arenethiolates, suggesting that the reaction follows a mechanism in which the thiolate acts as a nucleophile and the aryl group an electrophile.

The coal beds studied are from the Main Bituminous field of Pennsylvania (which currently contains 24 coalbed methane pools) and the Northern and Southern Anthracite coal fields. They range from the Middle Pennsylvanian Allegheny Group to the Late Pennsylvanian-Early Permian Dunkard Group. Previous US Bureau of Mines studies revealed gas contents from 0.4 to 13.8 cm3/g at depths of 99 to 432 m for the bituminous coal beds of the Allegheny Group. More recent core data from the Allegheny Group yielded gas contents from 2.2 to 8.9 cm3/g at depths from 167 to 387 m. In the Anthracite region of eastern Pennsylvania, the little data that are available show that gas content is anomalously high or low. Gas yields from test holes in eastern Pennsylvania are low with or without artificial stimulation mainly due to the lack of a good cleat system. Overall estimates of coalbed methane resources indicate there may be 1.7 Tm3 (61 Tcf) of gas-in-place contained in the Northern Appalachian coal basin. The amount of technically recoverable coalbed methane resources is projected by the US Geological Survey National Oil and Gas Resource Assessment Team [US Geological Survey National Oil and Gas Resource Assessment Team, 1996. 1995 National assessment of United States oil and gas resources-results, methodology, and supporting data, US Geological Survey Digital Data Series DDS-30, CD-ROM, Denver, CO, 80 pp.] and Lyons [Lyons, P.C., 1997.

This includes portions of Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, and a small part of Maryland. Consequently, a mapping investigation was conducted to evaluate the regional geology of the bituminous coal-bearing intervals in southwestern Pennsylvania and its influence on coalbed methane potential. Phase I of this study involved the entire Pennsylvanian coal-bearing interval of southwestern Pennsylvania. Phase II focused on a stratigraphic delineation and evaluation of Allegheny Group coal beds and associated sandstones. Several prospective coal beds and associated facies relationships with channel-fill sandstones were determined. Possible non-coal scenarios for coalbed methane include erosional contacts between coal beds and overlying channel-fill sandstones and areas of stacked channel-fill sandstones. Repetitive sequences of coal accumulation are stacked, commonly with shale interburden, and are also potential coalbed methane targets. Additional Pennsylvania Geological Survey drilling/coalbed methane sampling occurred in Armstrong, Beaver, Cambria, Greene, Lawrence, Somerset, and Washington Counties. Raw coalbed methane desorption data tables/graphical displays of gas contents versus depth, thickness, and time, and average composition and heating values from coal beds of the Allegheny Group to the Dunkard Group are available at the Pennsylvania Geological Survey. Further information on cross-sections, isopleth maps, isopach maps, raw drillhole data, and ownership issues can also be obtained from the same source.A mapping of the regional geology of the bituminous coal-bearing intervals in southwestern Pennsylvania reveal several prospective coal beds and associated facies relationships with channel-fill sandstones.

Today, the dynamics (process) responsible for this change are being examined using computer models, especially General Circulation Models (GCM's). Through such work our understanding of the dynamics of the Earth system improves and our ability to predict future trends is enhanced. But, the success of modelling experiments can only be assessed by comparing results with observations (the pattern), which, for palaeoclimate, are drawn exclusively from the geological record. Palaeoclimate interpreted from geological data is invariably based on analogy with the Recent, the validity of which depends on corroboration from multiple lines of evidence. This requires the compilation and investigation of large, global datasets of well-constrained geological climate proxies. This study uses the palaeodistribution of fossil crocodilians to examine the spatial distribution of palaeoclimate during this transition. Fossil crocodilians have a relatively good fossil record and are climatically limited in the Recent. They also provide a manageable global dataset with which to investigate other issues that impinge on the use of geologic data for reconstructing palaeoclimate: taphonomy, sampling effects, time-averaging, tectonics, and, for fossils, palaeobiogeography and evolution. As such this study provides a possible template for examining other climate proxies in order to validate and hone palaeoclimatic interpretations. An analysis of modern crocodilians indicates that temperature is the principal influence on their global distribution, with the Coldest Month Mean temperature (CMM) of ≃5.5°C marking the minimum thermal limit for the group, corresponding today to a minimum Mean Annual Temperature (MAT) of ≃ 14.2°C. The duration of warmth during the year (partly indicated by the Mean Annual Range of Temperature, MART) is also important, as this affects early juvenile development and survival. The presence of standing water provides an essential thermal buffer against temperature extremes. By analogy, the palaeodistribution of fossil crocodilians suggests the following: during the Late Cretaceous and early Palaeogene MAT's in excess of 14.2°C (CMM's > 5.5°C) permeated throughout mid-latitudes and coastal regions in high latitudes; during the Oligocene the restriction of fossil crocodilians to low latitudes suggests high-latitude cooling, as indicated by numerous other lines of evidence - coeval restriction of crocodilians to coastal regions in mid-latitude North America and much of Asia, consistent with increased seasonality and aridification in continental interiors, may reflect local orographic changes as well as global climate change. During the Miocene fossil crocodilians return to the Great Plains of North America, but do not reoccupy the continental interior of Asia; by the Pliocene, crocodilians are again restricted to low-latitudes and coastal regions in mid-latitudes, coincident with further high-latitude cooling, and aridification and cooling of mid-latitude continental interiors. Minor distributional changes during the Holocene may reflect human effects.","Cenozoic; Cretaceous; Crocodilians; Palaeoclimate; Paleobiogeography; Paleobiology","Cretaceous; crocodilian; palaeoclimate reconstruction; Crocodylidae (all crocodiles)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032030855

But this masks a more complex pattern. This is investigated here using a comprehensive database of fossil crocodilians that provides the opportunity to examine spatial and temporal trends, the influence of sampling, and the role of climate in regulating biodiversity. Crown-group crocodilians, comprising the extant families Alligatoridae, Crocodylidae, and Gavialidae, show the following trend: an initial exponential diversification through the Late Cretaceous and Paleocene that is restricted to the Northern Hemisphere until after the K/T boundary; relatively constant diversity from the Paleocene into the middle Eocene that may be an artifact of sampling, which might mask an actual decline in numbers; low diversity during the late Eocene and Oligocene; a second exponential diversification during the Miocene and leveling off in the late Miocene and Pliocene; and a precipitous drop in the Pleistocene and Recent. The coincidence of drops in diversity with global cooling is suggestive of a causal link - during the initial glaciation of Antarctica in the Eocene and Oligocene and the Northern Hemisphere glaciation at the end of the Pliocene. However, matters are complicated in the Northern Hemisphere by the climatic effects of regional uplift. Although the global trend of diversification is unperturbed at the K/T boundary, this is largely due to the exceptionally high rate of origination in the early Paleocene. Nonetheless, the survival of such a demonstrably climate-sensitive group strongly suggests that a climatic explanation for the K/T mass extinctions, especially the demise of the dinosaurs, must be reconsidered. © 1998 The Paleontological Society.",,"Alligatorinae; Crocodylidae (all crocodiles); Dinosauria; Gavialinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056231991

B., Konstanz, Germany","The general stress-induced sigma subunit σ(S) of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase is closely related to the vegetative sigma factor σ70. In view of their very similar promoter specificity in vitro, it is unclear how sigma factor selectivity in the expression of σ(S)-dependent genes is generated in vivo. The csiD gene is such a strongly σ(S)-dependent gene. In contrast to σ(S), which is induced in response to many different stresses, csiD, whose expression is driven from a single promoter, is induced by carbon starvation only. To our knowledge, the csiD promoter is the first characterized promoter which is not only exclusively dependent on σ(S)-containing RNA polymerase (Eσ(S)), but also requires an activator, cAMP-CRP. In addition, leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) acts as a positive modulator of csiD expression. Also in vitro, Eσ(S) is more efficient than Eσ70 in csiD promoter binding, open complex formation and run-off transcription, which might be due to the poor match of the csiD -35 region to the σ70 consensus and to transcription by Eσ(S) being less dependent on contacts in this region. By DNase I protection experiments, a cAMP-CRP binding site centered at -68.5 nucleotides upstream of the csiD transcriptional start site was identified. While cAMP-CRP stimulates Eσ70 binding, it does not promote open complex formation by Eσ70, but does so in conjunction with Eσ(S). With linear templates, cAMP-CRP significantly stimulates Eσ(S)-mediated in vitro transcription, whereas transcription by Eσ70 is negligible and hardly stimulated by cAMP-CRP. These findings may reflect different or less stringent positional requirements for an activator site for Eσ(S) than for Eσ70, and indicate that cAMP-CRP contributes to sigma factor selectivity at the csiD promoter. In vitro transcription experiments with supercoiled templates, however, revealed significant cAMP-CRP-stimulated transcription also by Eσ70. Yet, under these conditions, H-NS was found to restore Eσ(S) specificity by strongly interfering with cAMP-CRP/Eσ70-dependent transcription. Lrp strongly and cooperatively binds to multiple sites located between positions -14 and -102 (in a way that suggests DNA wrapping around multiple Lrp molecules) and moderately stimulates in vitro transcription, especially with Eσ(S). In summary, we conclude that the csiD promoter has an intrinsic preference for Eσ(S), but that also protein factors such as cAMP-CRP, Lrp and probably H-NS as well as DNA conformation contribute to its strong Eσ(S) selectivity. Furthermore, this strong Eσ(S) preference in combination with a requirement for high concentrations of the essential activator cAMP-CRP ensures csiD expression under conditions of carbon starvation, but not other stress conditions.","H-NS; Lrp; Promoter; rpoS; Sigma factor","bacterial DNA; carbon; cyclic AMP; DNA binding protein; regulator protein; sigma factor; article; bacterial gene; controlled study; DNA conformation; Escherichia coli; gene expression regulation; gene induction; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein DNA binding; stress; Bacteria (microorganisms); Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032548903

A simple global risk assessment methodology, employed to determine areas at high, moderate, and low risk crop yield reduction from two major air pollutants (O3 and SO2), gave some indication of the probable magnitude and extent of the threat to agriculture.

However, it is not correct to state that rational use of energy and reduction of CO2-emission are intrinsic to CHP. The amount of energy savings and CO2-reduction by using CHP strongly depend on the performances of the CHP plants (efficiencies, valorization of electricity and heat, number of running hours) and of the characteristics of the reference situation with separate production of heat and power. Especially nowadays, as performances of separate systems for the production of electricity and heat [electricity production by combined cycle plants (efficiency &gt; 50%) and heat production by high efficiency boilers (efficiency &gt; 90%)] are strongly improving, the required performances of CHP plants being preferable to separate systems for the production of heat and power, have to be tightened. In this paper, a calculation methodology for evaluating the primary energy consumption and CO2-emission for both options (CHP and separate production of heat and power) is presented. Based on calculations with this methodology and with practical figures of performances of CHP plants and separate systems for production of heat and power, the boundary conditions that have to be met by CHP systems for being less energy consuming and less CO2-producing are discussed. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

These objects are experiencing intense episodes during which hundreds of massive stars are being formed. These young massive stellar clusters emit the major fraction of their energy in the UV range covered by IUE, but they can also dominate almost all energy ranges. In this contribution the properties of the spectral energy distribution of these galaxies will be reviewed. The influence of different effects on the resulting SED will be discussed, including the shape of the Initial Mass Function, the metallicity, the evolutionary state of the burst and the interstellar extinction by dust grains. The newly formed massive stars are a powerful source of ionizing photons. We would expect therefore strong Lyman α emission at 1216 Å originating in these regions. Nevertheless, IUE showed that in most cases this emission was absent or much weaker than expected. Lyman α photons are resonantly scattered by the neutral gas, and even low amounts of dust can effectively destroy them. We will show that if the neutral clouds are not static with respect to the ionized region, the Lyman alpha emission photons will be partially able to escape, explaining so the properties of some starbursts in which the emission was detected with IUE. These gas flows are powered by the kinetic energy which is released into the surrounding medium via stellar winds and supernova explosions.","Lyman alpha emission; Population synthesis; Starburst galaxies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11744346675

The fluorescence from Trp157, the single tryptophan residue in the primary sequence of IL-6, is altered in IL-6D, where the wavelength maximum is blue-shifted by 3 nm and the emission intensity is reduced by 30%. These data suggest that Trp157 is close to, but not buried by, the dimer interface. Both IL-6D and IL-6(M) are compact molecules, as determined by sedimentation velocity analysis, and contain essentially identical levels of secondary and tertiary structure, as determined by far- and near-UV CD, respectively. IL-6D and IL-6M show the same susceptibility to limited proteolytic attack, and exhibit identical far- UV CD-monitored urea-denaturation profiles With the midpoint of denaturation occurring at 6.0 ± 0.1 M urea. However, IL-6D was found to dissociate prior to the complete unfolding of the protein, with a midpoint of dissociation of 3 M urea, suggesting that dissociation and dimerization occur when the protein is in a partially unfolded state. Based on these results, we suggest that IL-6D is a metastable domain-swapped dimer, comprising two monomeric units where identical helices from each protein chain are swapped through the loop regions at the 'top' of the protein (i.e., the region of the protein most distal from the N- and C-termini). Such an arrangement would account for the antagonistic activity of IL-6(D).

The additional pressure loss of the conical converter is offset by the better quality of the inflow and because of a reduction in size of the main converter by at least the volume of the conical converter. By making use of the entrance cone as converter volume, construction volume can be reduced in comparison to diagonal inflow, for example. Due to the better flow distribution of the diagonal inflow and the variant with conical converter, converter volume can be reduced by approx. 10%. This reduction of overall converter volume offers the potential to compensate at least in part for the additional costs of a system with conical converter. Many theoretical advantages of the conical converter remain to be investigated. These include: improvement of cold-start characteristics (Phases I and II) and the effectiveness of the converter both when new and in an aged state; evening out of flow distribution with regard to the influence of individual cylinders in systems that have manifolds which are optimized for torque and have converter positioned close to the engine; reduction of the noise emission of the inlet cone. Extensive tests still need to be performed on engine test stands and in the vehicle in order to prove longterm mechanical stability and catalytic effectiveness.

The methane + n-hexane system exhibits type V phase behavior, in which partial miscibility of the two components is observed. The phase diagram for the binary mixture is predicted, and we concentrate on the critical region and liquid-liquid immiscibility observed in this system. The upper and lower critical end-points predicted by the SAFT-VR approach are in excellent agreement with the experimental data, as is the theoretical gas - liquid critical line. We treat the n-alkane molecules as chains of united-atom hard-sphere segments with square-well potentials of variable range to describe the attractive interactions. A simple empirical relationship exists between the number of carbon atoms in the alkane molecule and the number of segments in the chain model. The pure component vapor pressure curves and saturated liquid densities are calculated by fitting to experimental data from the triple to the critical point. The optimized parameters are then rescaled to the respective critical points. We use the Lorentz-Berthelot combining rules for the unlike size and energy interactions.

The well-documented economic and environmental benefits of a district energy system utilizing various combinations of simultaneous generation of heat, chilled water, and electricity are discussed briefly in this paper. A simple model for implementing increased utilization of district energy in the U.S. based on the experience in comparable European Union countries is presented. With 100% implementation of district energy serving the heating market sector, the U.S. could achieve an 8.5% reduction in CO2 emissions.

Recent consensus is that the modern city region forms an important focal point for assessment and implementation of energy strategies, facilitating practical solutions to local problems as well as providing beneficial additions to national policies. Reducing the carbon intensity of economies both prevents environmental degradation and supports the regional economy in the medium to long term. The authors look at the construction of a CO2 inventory for the Greater Manchester region, an urban conurbation set for economic growth after recent restructuring and diversification. The authors argue that, by providing an indication of the localised carbon flows specific to the region, it is possible to target problem areas, prioritise carbon-reduction strategies, and recommend policies that will ease the transition to a more sustainable urban settlement. The increased focus on finding 'local' solutions to the reduction of carbon intensity has coincided with privatisation of much of the energy industry. The newly competitive energy market conflicts with the shift to local-scale evaluations and has resulted in energy details as the regional level becoming increasingly harder to obtain. The problems experienced in the construction of this inventory will be common to other cities in the United Kingdom and will have to be addressed if the 'local' approach is to be as effective as is hoped.",,"carbon emissions; environmental planning; policy strategy; urban planning; England; Greater Manchester; Manchester; UK",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031712926

Labs., United States","Methods for decontamination of soil in situ are receiving increased attention, as the requirement to clean these sites has become a national concern. The continual and costly liability is an important corporate incentive to clean contaminated soils. The development of an effective technology for in situ decontamination is a priority issue. Some in situ decontamination processes are similar to enhanced oil recovery schemes and use an integrated heating approach. One such method consists of heating by conduction and convection in conjunction with electrical heating. Advantages of electrical heating are that the energy can be focussed and the soil heated uniformly. The integrated heating approach has been extensively tested in the United States in a joint venture between Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories (LLNL) and the University of California at Berkeley. The most significant test was done at an abandoned Naval Air Base, now named the LLNL Gasoline Spill Site. It has been demonstrated that such an integrated approach can remove hydrocarbon contaminates from in situ at an accelerated rate. The objective of this paper is to present a mathematical model that solves the heat transfer problem for the integrated heating process. The model is also used to investigate the practicality of the process in terms of energy requirements and the time it takes to clean the soil. The mathematical model combines all of the principal heat transfer mechanisms of the process. These are electrical heating, convection, conduction and accumulation of energy. In addition, conductive heat losses from the sides and bottom of the heated volume and the substantial variation of electrical resistivity with temperature are included. Calculations made using the mathematical model developed in this paper are in good agreement with results obtained with the general-purpose reservoir simulator, TETRAD.",,"Decontamination; Electric conductivity; Electric heating; Heat losses; Heat transfer; Hydrocarbons; Mathematical models; Military bases; Hydrocarbon contaminates; In situ decontamination; Naval air base; Soil pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032116568

The objective of this study was to review and describe the usage of fluorine-labeled deoxyglucose (FDG) and positron emission tomography (PET) in the diagnosis and management of head and neck cancer. Methods. Several prospective series, -including 159 newly diagnosed and previously untreated and 23 previously irradiated head and neck squamous cell carcinoma patients initially seen at the Wake Forest University Medical Center and evaluated by clinical examination, conventional computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (CT/MRI) scans, PET scans, and histopathologic studies,- were reviewed and the findings summarized for comparison of the correct differentiation of primary and metastatic cancers and for postirradiation tumor clearance in a subsegment of those cases. Results. Positron emission tomography scanning using a fluorine-labeled deoxyglucose (FDG) radiotracer proved as reliable as conventional scanning for primary and metastatic tumor identification. Compared with clinical examination, PET was better for identification of nodal metastatic tumors but poorer for small primary tumors. For previously irradiated patients treated at least 4 months before the test, PET scanning was clearly superior to clinical examination and conventional imaging in differentiating tumor recurrence from soft-tissue irradiation effects. Conclusions. Fluorine-labeled deoxyglucose-PET scanning is comparable to conventional imaging of head and neck cancers in detecting primary and metastatic carcinoma.

This testing involves operating the engine through the heavy-duty engine transient Federal Test Procedure (FTP). While in-use engine emissions testing would be beneficial in aiding regions to meet standards dictated by the Clean Air Act, the process of removing the engine from the vehicle, fitting it to an engine dynamometer, testing, and refitting the engine in the chassis, combined with costs associated with removing the vehicle from service, is expensive. A procedure for engine emissions testing with the engine in the vehicle using a chassis dynamometer was developed to mimic the FTP.

Surveys indicate that, overall, the condition of hardwood forests has either not changed or has marginally improved. However, stands growing on shallow, poorly buffered soils have a higher frequency and severity of decline symptoms, and some of these stands have continued to decline, in contrast to the general trend. In Ontario on the most sensitive sites (&lt;6 mequiv. exchangeable bases/100 g), decline symptoms increased coinciding with a decrease in B horizon pH and base saturation and with an exchangeable Al increase. On these sites the chemical analysis of foliage, root, xylem, and soils indicate that nutrient deficiencies, nutrient imbalances, or metal/nutrient antagonism are related to stand decline. There is a consistent spatial relationship between white birch decline in the Bay of Fundy area and acidic sea fog. Acid fog injures and leaches foliage and hastens soil acidification, leaving the stands weakened and making them more sensitive to stress, particularly drought. Some recent studies suggest that forest growth rates are declining and that the relationship with climate has deteriorated, implying that the forests are responding to a regional, nonclimatic, nonpathogenic stress. This could be a response to altered forest nutrient cycling associated with acidic deposition and chronic O3 exposure. A study of sugar maple in Ontario estimated that after the mid-1960s growth has declined between 0.66 and 0.96 m3·ha-1·year-1, and that the decline was greatest on poorly buffered soils. Without enhanced forest management and more stringent air pollution regulations, the sustainability of forest productivity in Eastern Canada is likely to be difficult because of air pollution and soil fertility losses. © 1998 NRC.","Acid deposition; Climate change; Dendroecology; Forest decline; Ozone; Sugar maple",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000589720

In this study we assume three scenarios (base, highest, and lowest benefits) based on the SMUD program and apply Best Available Control Technology (BACT) cost analysis to determine if shade trees planted in residential yards can be a cost effective means to improve air quality. Planting and maintenance costs, pollutant deposition, and biogenic hydrocarbon emissions are estimated annually for 30 years with existing deterministic models. For the base case, the average annual dollar benefit of pollutant uptake was $895 and the cost of biogenic hydrocarbon emissions was $512, for a net pollutant uptake benefit of $383 per 100 trees planted. The uniform annual payment necessary to repay planting and maintenance costs with a 10% rate of interest was $749. When high biogenic hydrocarbon emitting tree species were replaced with low-emitters, the base case benefit-cost ratio (BCR) increased from 0.5:1 to 0.9:1. The BCR for the 'highest' and 'lowest' benefit cases were 2.2:1 and - 0.8:1, respectively.

In the summers of 1994 and 1995, SOS implemented the Nashville/Middle Tennessee Ozone Study. This effort, the second SOS urban intensive study, conducted a series of integrated, processoriented airborne and surface measurement experiments to better understand the chemistry and meteorology associated with the production, transport, and impact of tropospheric ozone. Specific technical objectives addressed (1) the role of biogenic VOC and NOx emissions on local and regional ozone production, (2) the effect of urban-rural exchange/interchange on local and regional ozone production, (3) sub-grid-scale photochemical and meteorological processes, and (4) the provision of a high-quality chemical and meteorological data set to test and improve observation- and emission-based air quality forecast models. Some of the more significant findings of the 1994-1995 studies include the following: (1) Ozone production in Nashville was found to be close to the transition between NOx-sensitive and VOC-sensitive chemistry. (2) Ozone production efficiency (OPE) in power plant plumes, molecules of ozone formed per molecule of NOx emitted, was found to be inversely proportion to NOx emission rate, with the plants having the greatest NOx emissions exhibiting the lowest OPE. (3) During stagnant conditions, nighttime winds dominated pollutant transport and represent the major mechanism for transporting urban pollutants to rural areas. Ultimately, results provided by this research will allow improved assessment of existing ozone management strategies and provide better scientific tools for the development of future management strategies.

The networks are first trained on data obtained from a computer simulator of the cell prior to undergoing further on-line learning. Trained to predict the cell resistance and the resistance's trend indicators, the networks are applied to the control of cells in different cell states, with a view to preventing anode effects, the latter being deliberately induced by reducing the alumina feed rate or reducing the feeding frequency and duration. Results show that, with neural-predictive control, anode effects can be avoided, which should result in increased thermal stability, decreased power consumption, and reduced fluoride emissions.

A transition from monomixis to meromixis occurred from 1994 to 1995. Lake-wide surveys of temperature, conductivity, dissolved oxygen, ammonium and chlorophyll profiles, Secchi depth and light attenuation, and Artemia monica abundances conducted throughout 1993, 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1997 document the contrasts between monomixis and meromixis. During the monomictic conditions in 1993 and 1994, the lake thermally stratified in March and mixed to the bottom by December, the hypolimnion became anoxic in late March and the water column was oxygenated to the bottom by December. During meromictic conditions in 1995, 1996 and 1997, the absence of holomixis during winter resulted in persistent anoxic conditions beneath the chemocline, an accumulation of ammonium in the monimolimnion and depletion in the mixolimnion, and low mixolimnetic chlorophyll concentrations in the spring and autumn. A comparison of the density differences between 2 and 28 m due to thermal versus chemical stratification indicated thermal stratification predominated in 1993 and 1994, while in 1995, 1996 and 1997 chemical stratification dominated the density differences. Ammonium, the limiting nutrient in Mono Lake, was lower in the upper mixed layer throughout 1996 and 1997 compared to the monomictic years, 1993 and 1994. During 1996 and 1997, the annual maxima in Secchi depths were among the deepest observed during the past 19 years, and reflected the lower phytoplankton abundance caused by decreased availability of nitrogen as a result of strong chemical stratification and the absence of a period of holomixis.

One method of such estimation is through the use of the Landfill Air Emissions Estimation Model (LAEEM), which was developed and calibrated specifically for municipal solid waste (MSW) landfills. The industry is concerned with the applicability of LAEEM because the nature of materials placed in industry landfills is considered to be so different from those in MSW landfills, that emissions will likely be lower than model predictions. This study examined the basis of LAEEM and its calibration, and explored alternative predictive approaches. It was concluded that LAEEM, when defined in terms of the default AP42 factors, does not accurately represent uncontrolled methane and HAP emissions from industry landfills. It does not account for the attenuating effects of biodegradation and adsorption, nor does it account for the potentially slower migration of landfill gas through a fully saturated landfill zone or the oxidation of methane migrating through landfill covers.

The model is constrained by monthly SST fields (period 1986-1994) and monthly climatological mixed-layer, wind and CZCS-ChlA. We first focus the results on the period 1991-1994 for which seasonal observations are available. Except for January 1994 when a strong anomaly occurred (with high f(CO2) and low SST related to high wind conditions), the seasonal f(CO2) cycle is well reproduced each year: near-equilibrium values in austral summer and undersaturation in winter. Although the oceanic CO2 cycle is believed to be mainly thermodynamically controlled in the subtropics, we obtained better results when mixing and biological processes are included in the model. Compared to observations, residuals of the complete model are about 10 μatm in austral summer and almost zero in winter months when the air-sea flux toward the ocean is large. The simulated yearly air-sea CO2 flux shows the same interannual variations as the observations: the Indian Ocean subtropical sink was twice in 1993 compared to 1991 and 1992. For the period 1986-1994, in response to atmospheric CO2 growth rate (1.4 μatm/yr), the modelled oceanic f(CO2) increased, but at a lower rate (about 0.5 μatm/yr); the oceanic response appears to be faster in summer (0.75 μatm/yr) than in winter (0.4 μatm/yr). Due to the decreasing of Δf(CO2), the model suggests that the Indian Ocean subtropical sink increases progressively from 1986-1987 (0.1 to 0.2 mol/m2/yr) to 1993-1994 (0.5 mol/m2/yr), with a strong anomaly in 1989 (0.4 mol/m2/yr).","Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Indian Ocean; Models; Sea surface; Subtropic","carbon dioxide; sea surface; Indian Ocean",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031901033

Even assuming the Protocol is successfully implemented, the global warming treaty cannot succeed without the near-term participation of developing countries, many of which already or will soon produce excessive carbon emissions as a combined result of large population size and fairly high per capita carbon use.

Global warming would have substantial negative effects on the world environment and economy. Human population and economic growth continue to drive both energy use and carbon emissions. While the developed countries are the largest source of present and past emissions, developing countries are rapidly catching up. China will probably surpass the United States as the largest carbon emitter early in the next century. The global warming treaty signed in Rio in 1992 relies entirely on voluntary emission caps for developed countries and has had little or no apparent effect on emissions. Much stronger steps must be taken to avoid or lessen potential climate change. A globally determined but nationally imposed carbon tax should be adopted to internalize the future costs of carbon emissions into the present cost of fossil fuel and other carbon sources. This would allow the maximum use of free market forces and individual choice to determine how carbon emission reductions are achieved. In addition, national emission caps for all countries should be established. International trade mechanisms can be used to support universal implementation of these measures. Where possible, global warming policy should include strong but equitable incentives for sustainable development and population stabilization, important goals in themselves regardless of the extent of future climate change.",,"climate change; development; economic growth; global warming; population growth; tragedy of the commons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031688816

The steady-state mole fraction of the thioester intermediate was determined to be 0.23 in the presence and absence of ATP and bicarbonate. The kinetics of formation and hydrolysis of the γ-glutamyl thioester intermediate during CPS catalyzed hydrolysis of glutamine were determined. When ATP and bicarbonate are added to CPS and glutamine, the k(cat) for glutamine hydrolysis increases from 0.17 to 150 min-1. The observed rate constant for thioester intermediate formation increases from 18 to 580 min- 1, and the microscopic rate constant for hydrolysis of the intermediate increases from 0.15 to 460 min-1. These results demonstrate the kinetic competence of the thioester intermediate during glutamine hydrolysis.

The correlation filter is used to analyze the spectra of the transmitted and received pulses. We obtained a simple equation for deriving the density of the target molecule from an analogy of the differential absorption method. The measurement method was evaluated by a simulation study to measure methane in the 3 μm region using a solid-state optical parametric oscillator. The result shows that atmospheric methane can be measured by a system using the reflection from a hard target, and that the methane density derived by a simple equation has good linearity in the practical density range in methane measurements. It also indicates that the measurement is not sensitive to fluctuations in the multimode laser spectrum. The measurement system is compact and useful for various field measurements of atmospheric methane.","Atmospheric methan; Infrared laser; Long-path absorption measurement; Remote sensing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0011191352

M. crystallinum is equipped with three SOD isoforms. These isoforms were identified as Mn-, Fe-, and Cu/Zn-SODs, respectively. Mn-SOD was found in the mitochondrial fraction, Fe-SOD in the chloroplast fraction, and Cu/Zn-SOD is probably localized in the cytosol. The Fe-SOD found in M. crystallinum is the first iron-containing SOD enzyme to be characterized in the plant family Aizoaceae. Salt treatment increases the activity of this isoform earlier than the other SODs. Molecular masses of SOD isoforms were determined as 82, 48 and 34 kDa for Mn-, Fe-, Cu/Zn-SODs, respectively. Native Mn-SOD seems to be a tetramer, while Fe-SOD and Cu/Zn-SOD are dimers. All SOD isoforms show high thermal stability. Mn-SOD is active even after short heating at 90°C and FeSOD at 70°C. Moreover, high concentrations of β-mercaptoethanol used as a reducing agent did not destroy the function of all isoforms. With the salinity treatment in M. crystallinum, Crassulacean acid metabolism (CAM) is induced. Build-up of large stationary O2 concentrations in the leaf air spaces is associated with the photosynthetic CO2 reduction behind closed stomata in phase III of CAM. This illustrates why M. crystallinum may require higher antioxidative activities under NaCl stress and also explains earlier findings that CAM plants are more resistant than C3 plants to environmental stress as imposed by, for example, SO2 and O3.","C3-photosynthesis; CAM; Mesembryanthemum crystallinum L.; Oxidative stress; Salt stress; SOD","Mesembryanthemum crystallinum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031970387

When sediments were exposed to the air and subsequently dried, their ability to release P under anaerobic conditions was severely limited relative to sediments that were not exposed. Anaerobic P release in response to the addition of a toxicant (formaldehyde), bioavailable carbon sources (acetate or glucose), available sulfur (sulfate), and sulfide were used to infer possible causes for the decrease in anaerobic P release as a function of desiccation/oxidation. A substantial reduction in P release occurred in sediments that had not been exposed when formaldehyde was added. This suggests that anaerobic P release may be microbially driven. Addition of acetate and sulfate slightly enhanced P release from nondesiccated sediments, suggesting some C and(or) S limitation of the bacterial processes occurring in these sediments. Substantial P was released when sulfide was added to the nonexposed sediments, indicating that there is a significant amount of P associated with sulfide-reducible minerals (e.g. iron oxyhydroxides). Sulfide addition to exposed sediments released only about one-fourth of the P compared with nonexposed sediments. Furthermore, no additional P was released when sulfate was added to exposed sediments, but P was released in the presence of either glucose or acetate. Together these results indicate that the decrease in potential for P release from exposed sediments was caused by a shift in bacterial community structure (specifically the loss of viable sulfate-reducing bacteria), carbon limitation as a result of drying, and aging of minerals with which P is associated.",,"bacteria; desiccation; oxidation; phosphorus; sediment; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031864453

These injectors mix fuel and air and strain their interfaces to differing extents and thus create different local equivalence ratios within flow regions upstream of flame ignition and stabilization. Two of the devices studied are lobed fuel injectors, in which molecular mixing of reactants is associated with streamwise vorticity generation, while the third one is a non-lobed fuel injector. Results show that rapid mixing allowed both lobed injector geometries to produce very lean premixed flame structures, with a lower achievable turn-down or fuel/air mass flux ratio than for the analogous non-lobed injector, which largely produced distinct diffusion flames. All three injectors exhibited some level of sooting near walls and in the far-field region, with the non-lobed injector sooting to the greatest extent. At low fuel flow rates, in which the lobed injectors created locally very lean premixed conditions, there resulted lower NO x emissions as compared with non-lobed injector emissions. Yet at higher fuel-air mass flux ratios, NOx emissions from the lobed injectors were actually higher than for the non-lobed injector, likely due to reduced sooting and hence reduced radiative heat losses associated with enhanced mixing. For both lobed injector geometries examined here, CO emissions became high for low values of the fuel-air mass flux ratio, again consistent with locally premixed combustion behavior, despite the fact that fuel was injected separately from air, directly into the burner test section. The present study demonstrates that, for fuel-air mixing enhancement devices, control of the local equivalence ratio is critical in order to optimize burner emissions.",,"Air; Carbon monoxide; Combustion; Diffusion; Flame research; Fuel injection; Fuel systems; Gas emissions; Heat losses; Heat radiation; Nitrogen oxides; Soot; Equivalence ratio; Fuel burners",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032277339

Steady-state and transient response experiments were performed using a tubular flow reactor. Isotopically labeled methane, 13CH4, was used in studying the transient behavior of the catalytic system. Reactor effluents were analyzed by using gas chromatography, mass spectrometry, and chemiluminescense techniques. Steady-state reaction experiments showed that the catalyst has a high activity for reduction of NO over a wide oxygen concentration range (0-9800 ppm at 500°C). Higher N2 selectivities (less NH3) and higher methane conversion values were obtained at higher O2 concentrations. Experiments also showed that NO conversion was not affected by the presence of water (up to 6%), and higher nitrogen selectivities were obtained at higher H2O concentrations in the feed. On the other hand, significant and irreversible loss of activity was observed in the presence of SO2. The reaction experiments indicated the formation of SO3 and H2S over the catalyst.

Mutants defective in the production of LuxR (D1, D34, and MR1130) were found to be missing PHB, whose synthesis could be restored by complementation with luxR. Triparental mating with a V. harveyi genomic library revealed the presence of three genomic clones (G1, G2 and G3) that could also restore PHB synthesis and luminescence to cells which express low levels of luxR (D1 and D34) but not to luxR- cells (MR1130) suggesting that luxR expression was being stimulated. Analyses of luxR mRNA levels by mRNA dot blot hybridization and by primer extension confirmed that luxR mRNA levels were increased 4 to 7-fold in the D1 and D34 cells by the G1, G2 and G3 fragments and show that expression of a single genomic copy of luxR is sufficient to restore synthesis of PHB. The results demonstrate that V. harveyi LuxR controls the induction of a process not intimately involved in the bioluminescence system and clearly distinguishes its role in V. harveyi from that of LuxR from Vibrio (Photobacterium) fischeri, which has only been associated with regulation of light emission.

The most desirable life for citizens should be both mentally and physically sound, which are the basis of existence for all lives. A multistratal forest is estimated to have 25-30 times the green surface area monostratal grass. With underground organic compounds, multistratal forests also contribute to the reduction of CO2. Building facilities can be completed in short term with economic backing. But it takes biological time to regenerate a multistratal forest using living green construction materials. It is urgent to start the restoration and reconstruction of native green environments immediately. To form green environments of multistructure using plants, it is necessary to systematize the data from field investigations and to follow the scientific scenario based on potential natural vegetation. We propose the restoration of native forests, which function as disaster-prevention and environmental-preservation forests in urban and pre-urban areas. Native forests grow well with no management. With the ecological technique 600 sites have been successfully revegetated in the Japanese Archipelago, in Malaysia, Melaka, Kuala Lumpur, and Bangkok in Southeast Asia, and in Belem, Brazil, and Concepcion, Chile in South America.","Ecological scenario; Ecotechnology; Green environments; Multistratal forests; Potential natural vegetation; Restoration","forest management; greenspace; restoration ecology; urban area",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032192955

By making the emission standards strict step by step, we analyze the feasibility and implementability of the reduction scenario by the numerical simulations. We also analyze impact of assumed technological progress in the air pollutant abatement activities on the feasibility of scenarios. In this paper, it is argued that even if the emission taxes are introduced so as to reflect the social cost of the air pollutants, it has potential to increase the GNP and the welfare. However, the cost of reduction in the emission of air pollutants in terms of GNP is large and the welfare rapidly decreases less than generally tolerable level as the reduction rate increases, at least in the short run. We formulate a model of the total environmental economic system which controls the air pollutants emitted by not only industries but also households. The fundamental of the model is the non-linear dual system of the input-output analysis. The model is applied to the Japanese economy in 1995. Thirty two industries are distinguished, and three types of pollutants, CO2, SOx and NOx are analyzed. From this research, we obtain that, to achieve a great abatement of emission like made in the Kyoto Protocol, the technological progress in the abatement industries is an important key factor. A fairly large amount of R &amp; D investment into the abatement technology and related sciences will more pay than ever thought generally. And, to reduce the air pollutants emission by 15% less than the actual level in 1995 should have been a fairly strict goal at least in the short run. To consider other sources of the gases, it is almost in feasible unless the abatement technology progresses rapidly. © 1998, JAPAN SECTION OF THE REGIONAL SCIENCE ASSOCIATION INTERNATIONAL.

Distance traveled decreased significantly on TC days, with average reductions of 51 person-miles (58%) and 35 vehicle-miles (53%). When weighted by telecommuting frequency, average reductions of 11.9% in PMT and 11.5% in VMT were found over a five-day work week. Person-trips and vehicle-trips increased slightly (but not significantly) on TC days. This was due to statistically significant increases in commute trips by telecommuters (who more often went home for lunch on their TC days), partly counteracted by decreases in non-commute travel. The drive-alone mode share increased on TC days, both for all trips, and for commute trips in particular. Walking and biking shares also increased modestly on TC days, whereas shares of transit and ridesharing declined. Despite the increase in trip rates, TC-day reductions were found for all pollutants analyzed: 15% for total organic gas emissions, 21% for carbon monoxide, 35% for oxides of nitrogen, and 51% for particulate matter.

Moreover, the analysis of spatially resolved spectra shows that the above ratio decreases with increasing cluster radius. We find that, among the various explanations that we consider, the most likely requires the plasma to be optically thick for resonant scattering at the energy of the Fe Kα line. We argue that if this is the case, then measures of the iron abundance made using standard thermal emission codes that assume optically thin emission may significantly underestimate the true iron abundance. In the case of the core of Perseus, we estimate the true abundance to be ∼0.9 solar in a circular region with a radius of ∼60 kpc and centered on NGC 1275.

This decrease resulted from several factors, the most important of which was decreased industrial production and its restructuring. Adopted legislative measures proved positive impacts leading to the energy savings and increase of energy efficiency. Situation turned in 1996, since when the emissions started again gradually increase. The CO2 emission projections till 2005 or 2010 are uncertain, due to the economic transformation and establishment of the new state. Further development projection was based on the assumption, that CO2 emissions in energy shall be decreased, along with decrease of energy demand and energy saving within the whole economy. These goals may be reached through increased energy efficiency, limiting utilisation of fossil fuels and their replacement by renewable energy sources in primary energy sources accompanied with the liberalisation of fuels and energy. There are several options also to decrease non-energy CO2 emissions from industrial production. Two important directions are arising here: reduction of emissions in clinker production in the cement industry and CO2 utilisation for production of urea, which will be used as a semi-product for chemical industry, as well as a denitrification agent. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

At harvest, dry mass predicted from gas exchange data was 102.8 ± 4.7% of the observed dry mass in six trials. Neither radiation capture efficiency nor carbon use efficiency were affected by elevated [CO2], but yield increased by 13% due to a sustained increase in canopy quantum yield.

The xanthophyll-cycle pigments, the early light-inducible proteins, and their mRNA accumulated with increasing PSII excitation pressure irrespective of the way high excitation pressure was obtained (high-light irradiance or decreased CO2 and O2 availability). These findings indicate that the reduction state of electron transport chain components could be involved in light sensing for the regulation of nuclear-encoded chloroplast gene expression. In contrast, no correlation was found between the reduction state of PSII and various indicators of the PSII light-harvesting system, such as the chlorophyll a-to-b ratio, the abundance of the major pigment-protein complex of PSII (LHCII), the mRNA level of LHCII, the light-saturation curve of O2 evolution, and the induced chlorophyll-fluorescence rise.

Diagnosis of the environment revealed an elevated layer of convective instability between 700 and 540 hPa above a well-defined frontal zone. Elevated, upright convection resulted from the release of the convective instability as air parcels, ascending isentropically over the frontal zone, reached saturation. A second case, in which heavy rain (greater than 50 mm in 24 h) fell over parts of Oklahoma, Kansas and Missouri during the period 27-28 April 1994, is also examined. Once again, elevated thunderstorms resulted from the ascent of an elevated layer of convective instability over a strong baroclinic zone. Positive CAPE values are found by lifting air parcels having the maximum equivalent potential temperature in the lower portion of the troposphere, whereas no available energy is diagnosed for surface parcels. While both cases strongly resemble the climatology of elevated thunderstorms, these case studies suggest that convective instability aloft released by isentropic ascent, rather than frontogenetical forcing in the presence of weak symmetric stability, can result in heavy precipitation.",,"Stability; Air parcels; Available energy; Baroclinic zones; Case-studies; Convective instabilities; Frontal zones; Heavy precipitation; Potential temperature; Thunderstorms; baroclinic mode; precipitation intensity; thunderstorm; troposphere; Iowa; Kansas; Missouri; Oklahoma [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000598143

Under 2 x CO2 GCM scenarios, most Canadian peatlands will be exposed to increases in mean annual temperature ranging between 2 and 6°C and increases in mean annual precipitation of 0 to 15 %, with the most pronounced changes occurring during the winter. The increase in CO2 uptake by plants, through warmer temperatures and elevated atmospheric CO2, is likely to be offset by increased soil respiration rates in response to warmer soils and lowered water tables. CH4 emissions are likely to decrease in most peatlands because of lowered water tables, except where the peat surface adjusts to fluctuating water tables, and in permafrost, where the collapse of dry plateau and palsa will lead to increased CH4 emission. There likely will be little change in DOC production, but DOC export to water bodies will decrease as runoff decreases. The storage of C in peatlands is sensitive to all C cycle components and is difficult to predict. The challenge is to develop quantitative models capable of making these predictions for different peatlands. We present some qualitative responses, with levels of uncertainty. There will be, however, as much variation in response to climatic change within a peatland as there will be among peatland regions.","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climatic change; Dissolved organic carbon; Methane; Peatlands","carbon cycle; climate change; peatland; Canada",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031688664

The model should provide an accurate representation of the performance under various operating conditions. However, the performance estimated by previous models has been found to deviate from the measured performance under low oxygen and carbon dioxide cathode partial pressures. To solve this problem, we carried out a systematic analysis of the performance of several bench-scale cells operated under various cathode gas conditions and investigated a model of cathode polarization according to the oxygen reduction mechanism in molten carbonate. As a result, it has been clarified that the behavior of cathode polarization under various conditions is described well by the dependence of mixed diffusion of Superoxide ion O2 and CO2 in the melt on the assumed partial pressures at each total operating pressure.",,"Carbon dioxide; Cathodes; Diffusion in liquids; Electric resistance; Mathematical models; Molten materials; Oxygen; Polarization; Reaction kinetics; Reduction; Molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC); Fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032075198

For the main part of the EEP, reconstructions of soil cover are primarily based on results of actual palcosol profile studies and their geochemical properties. In regions where fossil soils are not well preserved, the reconstructions are based on the correlation between soil characteristics and vegetation cover. The cantgraphic reconstruction of the soil type distribution served as a basis for the estimation of humus carbon stocks in the fossil soils. The humus carbon content in 1-m layer of the soils, which represent modem analogues of palcosols, was used to estimate the carbon content of palcosols. The geographical location of soil zones and their areas differ from the present-day ones in all the cases. Estimations of humus carbon storage in the past soils were made within the limits of the key region (polygon) of the East European plain (between 46°N and 65°N and 25-30°E and 55°E), using an equal-area projection. The key area covers 3.2 x 106 km2. For the present day total quantity of soil humus carbon storage within the limits of the key-region is 41 Gt, that for the Eemian (Mikulino) interglacial maximum 56 Gt (137% of the present day value), for the Last Glacial maximum 6 Gt (15%), and for the Holocene optimum 49 Gt (120%).","Holocene; Organic carbon; Paleosol; Pleistocene","Europe; geochemistry; holocene; humus carbon stock; organic carbon; palcosol; Pleistocene; vegetation; carbon storage; paleosol; Quaternary; Europe, (East)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031809952

During the Hadean Eon between 4.3 and 3.8 Ga BP, major changes in the concentration of atmospheric CO2 and associated temperature changes had a profound influence on the carbonate geochemistry of the Hadean Ocean. Although no rocks are known to have survived prior to the Archean Eon, it is still possible to calculate approximate values for important seawater parameters during the Hadean Eon based on other sources of information and reasonable assumptions about processes such as weathering reactions. Our calculations are based on a linear temperature change from 100°C to 70°C and log P(CO(2)) change from 1 to -1.5 over the Hadean Eon. Over this range in temperature and P(CO(2)), the influence of T is relatively small, but changes in P(CO(2)) result in large compositional variations in the carbonate chemistry of Hadean seawater. In the early Hadean, seawater pH was probably about 5.8± ~ 0.2, DIC may have reached close to 130 mM, and alkalinity was perhaps close to 30 mM. By the late Hadean, seawater pH probably had changed to close to neutral (~6.8), and DIC and alkalinity were closer to present-day values. Even large uncertainties in Na+ + Cl-, K+ and Mg2+ concentrations produce relatively small uncertainties in our calculated values for the carbonic acid system. However, larger uncertainties result from reasonable ranges for Ca2+ concentrations and the saturation state of Hadean seawater with respect to calcite. Our calculations support the hypothesis that a carbonate chemistry of seawater roughly similar to that of modern oceans could have been acquired very early in Earth history. If seawater composition were buffered by reactions involving carbonates and silicates, then the composition of late Hadean-early Archean seawater was not vastly different from that of today. Thus, by the conclusion of the Hadean Eon, if not before, environmental conditions at the Earth's surface, including temperature and seawater composition, were sufficiently equable for the evolution of life, including the Archaebacteria: the extreme halophiles and thermophiles and methanogens. Contrary to the hypothesis of an early Na-bicarbonate ocean, our calculations suggest the possibility that the early oceans of Earth were a NaCl-dominated aqueous solution, with somewhat higher DIC and alkalinity concentrations, higher saturation state, and the possibility of lower calcium concentrations. The time course of approach of Hadean seawater to a carbonate composition closer to that of today is difficult to predict. It is distinctly possible that the concentration of calcium in seawater did not reach levels like that of modern seawater until the late Precambrian and thus constrained the timing of the 'Big Bang' of organic evolution, the emergence of the shelled invertebrates at the beginning of the Phanerozoic.",,"carbonate; early Earth; geochemistry; Hadean; seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032433363

During the past 250 years the atmospheric concentrations of CO2, CH4, and N2O have increased by 30, 145, and 15%, respectively. A doubling of preindustrial CO2 concentrations by the end of the twenty-first century is expected to raise global mean surface temperature by about 2°C and increase the frequency of severe weather events. These increases are attributed mainly to fossil fuel use, land-use change, and agriculture. Soils and climate changes are related by bidirectional interactions. Soil processes directly affect climatic changes through the production and consumption of CO2, CH4, and N2O and, indirectly, through the production and consumption of NH3, NO(x), and CO. Although CO2 is primarily produced through fossil fuel combustion, land-use changes, conversion of forest and grasslands to agriculture, have contributed significantly to atmospheric increase of CO2. Changes in land use and management can also result in the net uptake, sequestration, of atmospheric CO2. CH4 and N2O are produced (30% and 70%, respectively) in the soil, and soil processes will likely regulate future changes in the atmospheric concentration of these gases. The soil-atmosphere exchange of CO2, CH4, and N2O are interrelated, and changes in one cycle can impart changes in the N cycle and resulting soil-atmosphere exchange of N2O. Conversely, N addition increases C sequestration. On the other hand, soil processes are influenced by climatic change through imposed changes in soil temperature, soil water, and nutrient competition. Increasing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 alters plant response to environmental parameters and frequently results in increased efficiency in use of N and water. In annual crops increased CO2 generally leads to increased crop productivity. In natural systems, the long-term impact of increased CO2 on ecosystem sustainability is not known. These changes may also result in altered CO2, CH4, and N2O exchange with the soil. Because of large temporal and spatial variability in the soil-atmosphere exchange of trace gases, the measurement of the absolute amount and prediction of the changes of these fluxes, as they are impacted by global change on regional and global scales, is still difficult. In recent years, however, much progress has been made in decreasing the uncertainty of field scale flux measurements, and efforts are being directed to large scale field and modeling programs. This paper briefly relates soil process and issues akin to the soil-atmosphere exchange of CO2, CH4, and N2O. The impact of climate change, particularly increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, on soil processes is also briefly discussed.","Climate change; Greenhouse effect; IPCC; Land-use change; Ozone destruction","carbon dioxide; climate change; climate; environmental monitoring; greenhouse; soil degradation; soil; atmosphere-biosphere interaction; global change; soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031875013

Sequencing of a 40-kb DNA segment of the FK506 gene cluster from Streptomyces sp. MA6548 has revealed two additional polyketide synthases (PKS) genes fkbB and fkbC which lie upstream of fkbA, a PKS gene recently shown to be responsible for the last four condensation steps of the FK506 biosynthesis [Motamedi, H., Cai, S. J., Shafiee, A. and Elliston, K. O. (1997) Eur. J. Biochem. 244, 74-80]. fkbB and fkbC are contiguous and encode respectively, the first (790129 Da) and the second (374438 Da) components of the FK506 polyketide synthase, a complex of three multidomain polypeptides. The predicted domain structures of FkbB and FkbC are analogous to that of FkbA and comprise 30 fatty-acid-synthase(FAS)-like domains arranged in 6 modules. Each module performs a specific extension cycle in the assembly of the carbon skeleton of the FK506 macrolactone ring. The component activities for the initiation of the polyketide chain consisting of a dihydrocyclohexenylcarbonyl coenzyme A (CoA) synthetase and a dihydrocyclohexenylcarbonyl CoA reductase required for the formation of the dihydrocyclohexylcarbonyl CoA starter unit and an acyl-carrier-protein to which the starter unit is anchored and translocated to the appropriate site on the PKS multienzyme are located at the N-terminal region of the FkbB polypeptide. A third gene, fkbL, lies at one end of the cluster and encodes lysine cyclodeaminase which catalyzes α-deamination and cyclization of the lysine into pipecolate.

In particular, El Niño and its teleconnection in precipitation patterns over Australia, Indonesia, Peru, Ecuador, Northeast Brazil, tropical Africa, and in some cases in western Europe have been observed and well documented. In addition, in part due to international research efforts conducted under the overall umbrella of the World Climate Research Program, particularly the successful 10-year long TOGA program (1985-1994), there is a growing number of studies of other climate patterns connected to Atlantic and Indian Ocean sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies beyond the tropical Pacific alone. Even as the science of climate prediction evolves, current knowledge of short-term climate events such as ENSO can be used to mitigate negative impacts and take advantage of positive ones. Examples in agricultural intervention in Peru (Lagos and Buizer 1991) and Northeast Brazil (Moura 1994) show how decisions can be made to improve production even under environment stress caused by droughts. Studies relating ENSO and corn production in Zimbabwe also reveal tremendous potential for agricultural planning in Africa, allowing for appropriate international actions to be taken to relief potential famine. The impacts over the Peruvian and Chilean fisheries have been extensively studied (Glantz and Feingold 1990). They show a complex physical-biological-societal/economics linkage between a natural phenomenon (El Niño) and the socio-economic activities in these countries, as revealed in the intricate relationship between government, private industries (large and small), artisanal versus large-scale fisheries (Pfaff et al. 1999). Examples in energy applications are also emerging, for example, in the Hydroelectric Power plant of Salto Santiago in the Iguazu River, Brazil, with substantial savings achieved by using the 1996 La Niña, when dry conditions were forecasted over the southern South America region. Appropriate decisions were taken, thus saving over a hundred thousand American dollars in just a simple operation, taken under risky conditions! In this paper we analyze and review existing knowledge concerning climate modeling and prediction on seasonal-to-interannual time scales, particularly the ENSO phenomenon. We discuss the 1997/1998 'El Niño of the century' in terms of its development and devastating impacts, bringing flash flooding in Peru, extensive forest fires in the Amazon and severe droughts in the Brazilian Nordeste. We also discuss applications of climate forecasts in agricultural practices, hydro-electricity generation and infectious disease outbreaks (malaria, dengue, cholera) related to climate in Peru, Brazil, Colombia.",,"climate prediction; El Nino; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032465315

Whereas the needed accuracy and sensitivity is more than an order of magnitude less demanding than that for present state-of-the-art 14C instrumentation, the widespread acceptance of 14C AMS in biomedical research will require AMS spectrometers that are small, simple to operate and capable of handling CO2 samples.

U., Washington, DC 99164-6421, United States","Although agricultural soil management is the predominant anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere, little is known about the effects of alternative soil management practices on N2O emissions. In this study the NGAS model of Parton et al. (1996), coupled with a N and C cycling model, was used to simulate annual N2O emissions from 2639 cropland sites in the US using both no-till and conventional tillage management scenarios. The N2O mitigation potential of returning marginal cropland to perennial grass was also evaluated by comparing simulated N2O emissions from 306 Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) grassland sites with emissions from nearby cropland sites. Extensive soil and land use data for each site was obtained from the Natural Resource Inventory (NRI) database and weather data was obtained from NASA. The initial conversion of agricultural land to no-till showed greater N20 emissions per hectare than conventional tillage. Differences between the two tillage scenarios were strongly regional and suggest that conversion of conventionally tilled soil to no-till may have a greater effect on N2O emissions in drier regions. About 80% of the total emissions were from the Great plains and central regions mainly due to their large cultivated area. Croplands producing soy, wheat, and corn were responsible for about 68% of the total emissions with rice, cotton, and vegetable croplands having the greatest N2O flux (6.5-8.4 kg N2O-N ha-1 year-1) under either scenario. Model simulations estimate that the agricultural lands in the US produce 448 Gg N2O-N year-1 under a conventional tillage scenario and 478 Gg N2O-N year-1 under a no-till scenario. Model estimates also suggest that the conversion of 10.5 million hectares of cropland to grassland has a N2O mitigation potential of 31 Gg N2ON year-1, (8.4 Tg carbon equivalents year-1). This value is similar in magnitude to many of the major greenhouse gas (GHG) emission-reduction strategies currently being considered to help meet US GHG reduction goals. Thus the GHG mitigation potential of this conversion is substantial and may be a viable strategy to help meet GHG reduction goals.","CRP; Denitrification; Greenhouse gases; Nitrification; Nitrous oxide; Tillage","agricultural emission; greenhouse gas; nitrogen; soil management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031852930

Therefore, the main problem remains: how to produce hydrogen from hydrocarbon fuels without CO2 emission. The capture of CO2 from the SR process streams and its sequestration (underground or ocean disposal) are actively discussed in the literature. However, this method is energy intensive, poses uncertain ecological consequences, and still does not completely eliminate CO2 emission. Another approach is to decompose hydrocarbon fuels into hydrogen and carbon. The thermal decomposition of NG is a technologically simple one-step process without energy and material intensive gas separation stages and shows the potential to be a CO2-free hydrogen production process. The experimental results of the thermocatalytic decomposition of gaseous (methane and propane) and liquid (hexane, gasoline and diesel fuel) hydrocarbons over metal-oxide and carbon-based catalysts are presented. Although transition metal catalysts produce gas with high initial hydrogen concentration, their activity rapidly drops because of the surface deposition of carbon. Carbon-based catalysts offer certain advantages over metal catalysts, since there is no need for the carbon separation from the catalyst. Catalytic pyrolysis of light liquid hydrocarbons, including gasoline, over activated carbon yields hydrogen-rich gas (40-50 vol % H2). The decomposition of methane in binary mixtures with saturated and unsaturated hydrocarbons was also studied. It was found that the addition of small amounts of unsaturated hydrocarbons (e.g., acetylene) to methane noticeably increases the steady-state concentration of hydrogen in the effluent gas. The studied process can be the basis for the development of compact catalytic units for on-site production of hydrogen/methane blends from NG and liquid hydrocarbon fuels at gas refueling stations. The concept can also be used for a CO2-free production of hydrogen for fuel cell applications.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002953172

The five litter types are representative of the dominant local vegetation and offer a range of litter qualities. The bags were placed along a gradient, running from Great Basin Desert scrub (1960 m) through a pinyon-juniper woodland (2100 m) and up into a ponderosa pine forest (2280 m). Samples were collected and analyzed over a period of 2 yr. Decomposition was closely correlated with the relative proportion of easily decomposed carbon fractions to recalcitrant fractions for the first year. Litter from G. sarothrae and B. gracilis contained relatively low levels of lignin and high levels of cellulose and carbohydrates, and these litter types exhibited significantly faster rates of decay than the highly lignified pine and juniper litter. The order of the relative rates of decomposition was G. sarothrae >> B. gracilis > J. monosperma > P. ponderosa = P. edulis. There was no correlation between initial litter nitrogen content and the rate of decomposition, suggesting that decomposition is limited by carbon substrates rather than by nutrient content. Decomposition rates were significantly greater at the upper elevation sites, which were colder and wetter. Evidence strongly suggests that decomposition is limited by moisture in these ecosystems. Warmer temperatures resulting from climate change may not increase the rate of decomposition in the Southwest unless accompanied by increases in available moisture.","Bouteloua gracilis; Carbon; Gutierrezia sarothrae; Juniperus monosperma; Lignin; Mass loss; Nitrogen; Pinus edulis; Pinus ponderosa","climate effect; decomposition; elevation; environmental gradient; litter; Arizona; Great Basin Desert; United States; Bouteloua gracilis; Gutierrezia sarothrae; Juniperus monosperma; Pinus edulis; Pinus ponderosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031734852

Our survey covers a wide area (350° ≲ l ≲ 25°, |b| ≲ 3°) with a spatial resolution of 15′. We employed a new observing method called ""fast spectral scanning"" to make large-scale observations efficiently. Strong [C II] line emission was detected from almost all areas we observed. In the general Galactic plane, the spatial distribution of the [C II] line emission correlates very well with that of far-infrared continuum emission, but diffuse components are more prominent in the [C II] line emission; the I[C II]/ IFIR ratio is ∼0.6% for diffuse components but is ∼0.2% for compact sources such as active starforming regions. In the Galactic center region, on the other hand, the distribution of the [C II] line emission is quite different from that of the far-infrared continuum emission, and the I[C II]/IFIR ratio is systematically lower there. The FWHM velocity resolution of our instrument is 175 km s-1, but we determined the central velocity of the line at each observed point very precisely with statistical errors as small as ±6 km s-1. The longitudinal distribution of the central velocity clearly shows the differential rotation pattern of the Galactic disk and also violent velocity fields around the Galactic center.","Balloons; Diffuse radiation; Infrared: ISM: Lines and bands; ISM: Kinematics and dynamics; Surveys",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000463952

Microbially-mediated reduction of NO3- to N2 (denitrification) in the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) appears to greatly affect the natural isotopic abundances. The δ15N of NO3- increases from 6‰ in deep waters (2500 m) to 15‰ within the core of the denitrifying layer (250-350 m); the δ15N of N2 concurrently decreases from 0.6‰ to 0.20‰. Values of the isotopic fractionation factor (ε) during denitrification estimated using simple advection-reaction and diffusion-reaction models are 22‰ and 25‰, respectively. A strong decrease in δ15N of NO3- is observed from ~ 200 m (&gt; 11‰) to 80 m (~ 6‰); this is attributed to the input of isotopically light nitrogen through nitrogen fixation. Isotopic analysis of N2O reveals extremely large enrichments of both 15N and 18O within the OMZ, presumably due to the preferential reduction of lighter N2O to N2. However, isotopically light N2O is observed to accumulate in high concentrations above the OMZ indicating that the N2O emitted to the atmosphere from this region cannot be very heavy. The isotope data from the intense upwelling zone off the southwest coast of India, where some of the highest concentrations of N2O ever found at the sea surface are observed, show moderate depletion of 15N, but slight enrichment of 18O relative to air. These results suggest that the ocean-atmosphere exchange cannot counter inputs of heavier isotopes (particularly 18O) associated with the stratospheric back flux, as proposed by previous workers. This calls for additional sources and/or sinks of N2O in the atmosphere. Also, the N2O isotope data cannot be explained by production through either nitrification or denitrification, suggesting a possible coupling between the two processes as an important mechanism of N2O production.","Arabian Sea; Denitrification; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Stable isotopes","denitrification; diffusion; nitrification; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; isotopic analysis; nitrogen; Arabian Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032459453

In case of magnetic surfaces the information about the spin of the captured electron might be accessed via the polarization of the emitted light. In the grazing incidence mode, the surface sensitivity is highest due to the fact that the particles do not penetrate into the target surface but are scattered well above the uppermost atomic layer. Thus the electrons that neutralize the incoming ion originate from the topmost layer. This implies that the method is very well suited to investigate the properties of magnetic surfaces and multilayer structures. We present data that show the inherent surface sensitivity of this method. By properly choosing the experimental parameters one also assures that the energy deposited by the projectiles in the surface is negligible as well as the number of sputtered particles. We also present the first hysteresis curves recorded with this method, thereby showing that the measured signal follows the magnetic state of the surface. In combination with its surface sensitivity this shows that ion beam scattering is very well suited to investigate not only the surfaces of magnetic materials but also (ultra-)thin films and multilayer systems. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.","Ion-solid interactions; Iron; Low energy ion scattering; Magnetic measurements; Magnetic phenomena; Magnetic surfaces","Ion beams; Iron; Magnetic hysteresis; Magnetic thin films; Magnetic variables measurement; Magnetism; Multilayers; Surfaces; Low energy ion scattering; Ion bombardment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0042094688

The proposed approach is based on a `correction' of emissions calculated from average speed with a `Congestion Correction Factor' (CCF) taking into account the infinite different ways an `average speed' can be experienced by vehicles along a link. Such a correction factor represents the speed variability along the link, and is derived as a function of variables easily available to the file engineers: link length, traffic density, link average speed and percent of green at traffic light.

One important fundamental molecular property of an asphalt, which dictates its temperature-dependent performance, is the nature of the molecular motions associated with the asphalt molecular components. Changes in the rotational motions of the methyl carbons and the segmental motions of the methylene carbons in the 1- to 10-kHz frequency range were studied (via changes in spin-spin dipolar-dephasing relaxation times) as a function of temperature for three Strategic Highway Research Program asphalts using carbon-13 dipolar-dephasing cross polarization with magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance. The data indicate that the rotational motion of the terminal methyl carbons of n-alkanes in the amorphous phase is nearly independent of decreasing temperature until the glass-transition region is reached. Below the Tg, the rotational motion of the methyl carbons decreases slowly with decrease in temperature for asphalts AAA-1 and AAB-1. However, the methyl rotation in asphalt AAM-1 decreases more rapidly. The segmental motions of the methylene carbons in the mobile-amorphous phase for the different asphalts decrease rapidly with decreasing temperature from 20 to -20°C. At temperatures below -20°C, the segmental motions have essentially ceased. The slow, low-frequency motions of the methylene carbons in the interfacial (rigid-amorphous) and crystalline phases were found to be independent of temperature above and below Tg. It is suggested that the methyl rotation and segmental motions of the methylene carbons in the amorphous phase extensively influence the low-temperature rheological properties of asphalts.",,"Amorphous materials; Crystal structure; Glass transition; Low temperature effects; Molecular dynamics; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Paraffins; Phase interfaces; Polarization; Dipolar-dephasing cross polarization; Magic angle spinning (MAS) spectroscopy; Methyl carbons; Methylene carbons; Asphalt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032206848

SO2 emissions in Austria were reduced by 74.6%, which was the highest rate among all signatory states of the 1985 Helsinki protocol. In Linz, SO2 emissions, TSP, and NO2 were reduced from 47,000 ton in 1985 to 23,000 ton in 1990 by cleanup of steel and chemical industries, power plants, and domestic heating. An evaluation of the hypothesis of health benefits from these investments in a study on school children relating ambient air quality changes in elementary school districts to individual lung function growth confirmed and supplemented past cross-sectional results on chronic exposure to urban air pollution and lung function deficits at school-age. Endexspiratory flow rates related to chronic exposure to outdoor NO2 and to passive smoking, were impaired. Higher MEF25-growth related to NO2-decrease but unrelated to initial NO2 was observed. This indicated the importance of the last NO2-concentration that was low in districts where traffic increase did not counterbalance other improvements. The effects of SO2 on FVC was less pronounced than the smoking- and traffic-related effects on endexspiratory flowrates and their growth. The effects of air quality improvements during primary school age can still be proven at the age of 18 yr despite rough classification of exposure in school districts with the possibility of misclassification of individual exposures, indicating sustainable effects and health benefits from investments into clean air.

Geomorphologic changes were derived comparing orthophotocharts, aerial photograph and satellite imagery from 1984 to 1995. Sediment samples were collected in a quadratic mesh with an impact dredge in January/1994. Hydrological, climatological and plankton data were taken from April/1986 to March 1987, in August/1990 and January/1991. A numerical model was used as a tool to trace the modifications in the hydrodynamics as well as to predict trends. The alteration of the course of the Ipojuca River resulted into an estuary that tends to evolves from a classical towards a coastal lagoon type. Presently the Ipojuca estuary is near vertically homogeneous but shows a lateral stratification. Surface sediments had rapidly changed in response to the new circulation pattern imposed by landfilling and entrance constriction. Five different sedimentary facies were identified on the basis of sedimentologic characteristics. Four selected model outputs for tidal range of 2.4m were found before and after the port implantation. Landing, dredging and constructions changed the area geomorphology, hydrodynamism and plankton.

In view of the principle of international ecogeographical regionalization, this study has applied multivariate analysis and GIS method and based on some ecogeographical attributes limited to the distribution of plant and vegetation, including climatic factors, such as minimum temperature, mean temperature of the coldest month, mean temperature of the warmest month, annual average temperature, precipitation of the coldest month, precipitation of the warmest month, annual precipitation, CV of annual precipitation, biological factors such as vegetation types, vegetation division types, NPP, floristic types, fauna types, abundance of plant species, genus and endemic genus; soil factors such as soil types, soil pH; topographical factors as longitude, latitude and altitude etc. The ecogeographical regionalization for biodiversity in China was made synthetically by using fuzzy cluster method. Four classes of division were used, viz., biodomain, subbiodomain, biome and bioregion. Five biodomains, seven subbiodomains and eighteen biomes were divided in China as follows: I Boreal forest biodomain. I A Eurasian boreal forest subbiodomain.

At all four stations a distinct sulfate-methane transition zone was observed several meters below the seafloor in which both sulfate and methane are consumed. Nutrient porewater concentration profiles do not show gradient slope changes at the depths of the transition zones. Flux calculations carried out on the basis of the determined porewater profiles revealed that anaerobic methane oxidation accounts for 100% of deep sulfate reduction within the sulfate-methane transition zone and consumes the total net diffusive sulfate flux. A significant contribution of organic carbon oxidation to the reduction of sulfate at these depths could, therefore, be excluded. We state that porewater profiles of sulfate with constant gradients above the transition zones are indicative for anaerobic methane oxidation controlling sulfate reduction.

Beginning in year 2, plant aboveground C:N ratios were increased by 9% to 22% at elevated CO2 (P &lt; 0.01), depending on year. Total amounts of N removed in biomass harvests during the first 4 years were not affected by elevated CO2 (19.9 ± 1.3 and 21.1 ± 1.3 g N m-2 at ambient and elevated CO2), indicating that the observed plant biomass increases were solely attained by dilution of nutrients. Total aboveground P and tissue N:P ratios also were not altered by CO2 enrichment (12.5 ± 2 g N g-1 P in both treatments). In contrast to non-legumes (&gt;98% of community aboveground biomass), legume C/N was not reduced at elevated CO2 and legume N:P was slightly increased. We attribute the less reduced N concentration in legumes at elevated CO2 to the fact that virtually all legume N originated from symbiotic N2 fixation (%N(dfa)≃90%), and thus legume growth was not limited by soil N. While total plant N was not affected by elevated CO2, microbial N pools increased by + 18% under CO2 enrichment (P = 0.04) and plant available soil N decreased. Hence, there was a net increase in the overall biotic N pool, largely due increases in the microbial N pool. In order to assess the effects of legumes for ecosystem CO2 responses and to estimate the degree to which plant growth was P-limited, two greenhouse experiments were conducted, using firstly undisturbed grassland monoliths from the field site, and secondly designed 'microcosm' communities on natural soil. Half the microcosms were planted with legumes and half were planted without. Both monoliths and microcosms were exposed to elevated CO2 and P fertilization in a factored design. After two seasons, plant N pools in both unfertilized monoliths and microcosm communities were unaffected by CO2 enrichment, similar to what was found in the field. However, when P was added total plant N pools increased at elevated CO2. This community-level effect originated almost solely from legume stimulation. The results suggest a complex interaction between atmospheric CO2 concentrations, N and P supply. Overall ecosystem productivity is N-limited, whereas CO2 effects on legume growth and their N2 fixation are limited by P.","Dinitrogen fixation; Legumes; Nutrient limitation Phosphorus; Plant functional types","calcareous grassland; carbon dioxide enrichment; ecosystem approach; nutrient dynamics; phytochemistry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031683038

The four alkylglucosides are 2-ethylhexyl α- D-glucoside, 2-ethylhexyl β-D-glucoside, n-octyl α-D-glucoside, and n- octyl β-D-glucoside. Two questions are addressed. The first concerns the general influence on surfactant properties of the type of linkage, α or β, between the glucose head group and the surfactant tail. The second question concerns the difference in properties between straight and branched hydrocarbon chains. The binary phase diagrams (temperature vs concentration) and the properties of the one-phase regions have been determined. In the micellar regions, 1H NMR self-diffusion experiments have been performed to determine the micellar sizes in the temperature range from 25 to 55°C. The melting enthalpies of the pure substances have been determined by means of DSC to obtain information about differences in the crystal stability between molecules with α- or β-linkage. A general result of this work is that the α-linkage gives rise to an increased crystal stability and, as a consequence, an increased Krafft boundary. In the two cases with straight hydrocarbon chains several different liquid crystal phases appear, whereas in the two cases with branched hydrocarbon chains there is only a lamellar phase.","1H-NMR self-diffusion; Alkylglucosides; Binary phase diagrams; DSC; Micelles; Straight vs branched chain; α- vs β-linkage","2 ethylhexyl alpha dextro glucoside; 2 ethylhexyl beta dextro glucoside; glucose; glucoside; hydrocarbon; n octyl alpha dextro glucoside; n octyl beta dextro glucoside; surfactant; unclassified drug; article; enthalpy; micelle; physical chemistry; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032128070

Two approaches, based on diffusion, to relate the present-day shape of a scarp to its age are used here. The first assumes a model of scarp degradation based on a diffusive process (D method). The second evaluates the state of scarp degradation using the slope distribution along a topographic profile (SD method).-Based on an anthropic scarp of known age, we have obtained a mass diffusivity close to 1.5 m2/ka, a reasonable value for areas characterized by a continuous .vegetation cover and a temperate climate. We show that the SD method requires an age correction, since it does not take into account the earliest stage for which the mid-height point is not yet affected by erosion. However only the SD method reveals that at several profiles a later scarp reactivation event has occurred. Such information can be important when trying to identify the recent geological or environmental events that have affected a region.

Using recent case studies, we examine air pollution policy at three regional scales: within states, among states, and across national borders. Each scale has a 'policy regime' that best operates within its jurisdictional boundaries. As spatial scale increases, policy making becomes more difficult and the resultant policies are less equipped to deal with air pollution or similar environmental problems capable of traveling across human-designated jurisdictions.","Air quality; Environmental policy; OTC; SCAQMD; Spatial scale; Transboundary pollution; US-Canada air quality agreement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040088744

The photoreaction proceeds by the quenching of the excited singlet of anthracene by the indoles. Bimolecular quenching rate constants in acetonitrile follow a Rehm-Weller type correlation In the nonpolar solvent n-heptane, the rate constants are of the same order of magnitude than those in acetonitrile. However, methyl substitution at the N heteroatom of the indole greatly reduces the quenching in this solvent. In these cases, exciplex emission was observed. These differences in quenching capacity may be explained by a charge transfer interaction followed by proton transfer in the excited state, when it is available at the N-H bond. A nonreactive decay route and exciplex emission is operating in the case of the N-CH3 derivatives. Photobleaching quantum yields were also determined in heptane. The substitution by methyl or cyano groups at 9 and 10 positions on the anthracene ring decreases the reaction quantum efficiency. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

Recent advancements in the area of portable emissions analyzers enable them to be an effective tool to accomplish this task. Coupling these advancements with proper testing techniques in the areas of sample conditioning and instrumentation has been accepted in some states as a viable means for conducting protocol emissions testing. This paper will outline some of the advancements associated with portable emissions analyzers as compared to traditional protocol analyzers, and in addition, emphasize proper instrumentation and test procedures to be utilized to achieve the desired results. This paper takes a macro approach to testing with a portable analyzer, and does not get into specific testing detail since much of the legwork in this area has been accomplished and published in a form similar to 40 CFR subpart 60 (Code of Federal Regulations) in a document labeled CTM-022 (EPA's Conditional Test Method).

The combination of logging, smelting, fires and erosion resulted in an unusual anthropogenic ecosystem of denuded barren land with lifeless lakes, or a micro-desert. Since the 1970s, however, the concerted efforts made to reduce the emissions and rehabilitate parts of the degraded ecosystem have resulted in improvements in water quality, and recoveries in phytoplankton, zooplankton, zoobenthos and fish communities but have had little impact on toxic metal concentrations in many lakes. We show that most of the catchments in the Sudbury basin have become saturated with Cu and Ni, and some with Zn and Pb. It is estimated that mobilization of metals stored in soils and glacial overburden by surface runoff, groundwater drainage and wind re-working of tailings can sustain the high concentrations of Cu and Ni in many lakes for well over 1000 years. Strategies to immobilize the pollutant metals in the watershed rather than further emission controls may be required for dealing with high levels of toxic metals in surface waters of the saturated ecosystems.

Since an underlying community structure could not be revealed by analyzing the total eubacterial rDNA, we first fractionated the DNA on the basis of guanine-plus-cytosine (G+C) content by using bisbenzimidazole and equilibrium centrifugation and then analyzed the bacterial rDNA amplified from a fraction with a high biomass (63% G+C fraction) and an fraction with a low biomass (35% G+C fraction). The rDNA clone libraries were screened by amplified rDNA restriction analysis to determine phylotype distribution. The dominant biomass reflected by the 63% G+C fraction contained several dominant phylotypes, while the community members that were less successful (35% G+C fraction) did not show dominance but there was a very high diversity of phylotypes. Nucleotide sequence analysis revealed taxa belonging to the groups expected for the G+C contents used. The dominant phylotypes in the 63% G+C fraction were members of the Pseudomonas, Rhizobium-Agrobacterium, and Rhodospirillum assemblages, while all of the clones sequenced from the 35% G+C fraction were affiliated with several clostridium assemblages. The two-step rDNA analysis used here uncovered more diversity than can be detected by direct rDNA analysis of total community DNA.

If and how these extremes are connected with global warming due to an increasing greenhouse effect is an open question. However, we feel justified, both for theoretical and practical reasons, in making the following recommendations for future research: Continued observation and information on extreme erosional events and natural hazards are important in order to clarify their climatic links and for safer environmental management for the benefit of people who work or are tourists in the mountains and downstream areas. It is also necessary to improve our knowledge of the connections between local weather extremes and regional climatic trends, e.g. through reconstruction of the former frequency of events during periods of rising temperatures. Two kinds of erosional processes and natural hazards, which may increase in frequency during a climatic warming, are discussed: i) snowmelt-triggered floods and slushflows in spring; and ii) rainstorm-triggered floods and debris flows in summer and autumn.",,"erosion; extreme event; flood; landslide; mountain region; natural hazard; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031847026

The thermal evolution of these powders was studied up to zircon crystallisation and the colour properties of the resulting pigments were evaluated and related to the nature and localisation of the chromophore in the zircon matrix. The effects of the addition of a flux agent (NaF) on the colour properties of the pigments was also investigated. It was found that green Cr-doped pigments can only be obtained by heating the starting powders at 1300° C in the presence of NaF, since in the absence of the flux, the whole amount of the Cr ions was volatilised during zircon formation (1500°C). This colour was mainly due to Cr3+ ions located out of the zircon lattice, probably forming a sodium chromium (III) silicate. In Co doped zircon, the addition of NaF had no influence on the temperature of zircon formation (1100°C), although it affected the colour properties of the resulting pigments. Thus, the colour observed in the absence and the presence of the flux was green and blue, respectively. Although the only Co phase detected in both cases was Co2SiO4, the green colour was tentatively attributed to the presence of a small amount of unreacted CoO, whereas the blue one, to the formation of a certain amount of a sodium cobalt (II) silicate. © 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

The design of the exhaust gas turbine generator was based on a conventional turbocharger for a direct-injection diesel engine. Data from steady-state bench tests using air indicates about 50% of the turbine input energy can be converted to electric energy. Turbine generator output averaged 3 kW, while a maximum of about 6 kW was observed. Based on this data, we estimate that energy consumption in a vehicle could be reduced between 5% and 10%. Engine tests were conducted under both steady-state and transient conditions. These tests revealed that optimal performance occurred under high-speed, high-load conditions, typical of highway or uphill driving, and that performance at low-speed, low-loads was relatively poor. The efficiency at low engine speeds could be improved by controlling the inlet flow to the turbine generator.

Then we proposed the effective system of the external EGR for a spray combustion system such as a gas turbine combustor. In this paper, we tried to obtain various combustion characteristic related to the EGR effect. The EGR ratio was defined by the O2 concentrations of the EGR gas and the total inlet gas to which EGR gas was added. The combustion characteristics at 0 % to 20 % of the EGR ratio were measured to investigate the effect of the external EGR. The total inlet gas was the mixture, in which a fresh air was mixed with a hot burned gas recirculated externally. The O2 concentration in the total inlet gas decreased from 21 % to 19 %. The temperature of the total inlet gas increased from room temperature to about 110°C. The results showed that the combustion characteristics were improved by the EGR. At a high level of the EGR ratio, hot EGR gas promoted to vaporize the kerosine spray. This kerosine vapor and combustion air formed a homogeneous mixture gas which stabilized high intensity flame. It resulted flame stabilization in wide range of the EGR. Flame which was filled up fully in the combustion chamber was non-luminous flame like a gaseous fuel combustion. Also, the level of NO concentration in the exhaust gas was reduced. In the flame of high EGR ratio, hot spots which caused NO formation in the flame were highly reduced. And the residence time in the combustion chamber was also reduced, because of the average sectional velocity increased with an increase of the recirculating gas flow in the system. So the maximum values of NO concentration in the combustion chamber were reduced in all cases of experimental conditions with EGR. The level of NO concentration in the exhaust gas was suppressed to about 60 % compared with no EGR combustion states.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3743128625

The amounts of NOx chemisorbed on In/H-ZSM-5 were well proportional to the catalytic activities for NOx reduction. Pd/H-ZSM-5, on the other hand, hardly chemisorbed NO2, while the catalytic activity for NO2 reduction with CH4 is very high. Furthermore, Pd loaded on SiO2 showed comparably high catalytic activity for NO2 reduction with CH4 at 400°C in the absence of oxygen as Pd/H-ZSM-5. CH4 combustion during NOx reduction with CH4 in the presence of oxygen significantly occurred over PdO on SiO2, while less over Pd/H-ZSM-5.

H-mordenite, H-ZSM-5, and H-beta gave higher activities with In2O3 for reduction of NO2 than in the absence of In2O3. This indicates that InO+, formed by the solid state ion exchange between In2O3 and protonic acid sites of zeolites, is active for this reaction. The level of solid state ion exchange was well correlated to the strength of zeolitic acidity; the sequence of the catalytic activity was on the order of H-mordenite &gt; H-ZSM-5 &gt; H-beta ≫ H-Y &gt; SiO2-Al2O3. The size of H-ZSM-5 particles made a difference in the catalytic activity for NO2-CH4 reaction; the activity decreased with increasing particle size. There exists a particle structure effect on the creation of InO+ on the zeolite structure: mesopores are needed for the dispersion of In2O3 into ZSM-5 zeolite structures, while the In2O3 is not always used for the creation of InO+ sites. In/H-ZSM-5 having larger amounts of In on the external surface of ZSM-5 showed lower catalytic activities for NO2-CH4 reaction in the case that the same ZSM-5 grains are used. The decrease of the In/Si ratio on the outer surface of zeolite corresponds to the decrease in the amount of NH3 desorbed during TPD measurements, that is, the increase in the number of InO+ sites. There might be a diffusion limitation on In/H-ZSM-5 during NO2-CH4 reactions in the reaction conditions studied. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The network aims at providing validation material for satellite radiometry and climate models. It further aims at detecting long-term variations in irradiances at the earth's surface, which are believed to play an important role in climate change. The network and its instrumentation are designed 1) to cover major climate zones, 2) to provide the accuracy required to meet the objectives, and 3) to ensure homogenized standards for a long period in the future. The limits of the accuracy are defined to reach these goals. The suitable instruments and instrumentations have been determined and the methods for observations and data management have been agreed on at all stations. Measurements of irradiances are at 1 Hz, and the 1-min statistics (mean, standard deviation, and extreme values) with quality flags are stored at a centralized data archive at the WCRP's World Radiation Monitoring Center (WRMC) in Zurich, Switzerland. The data are quality controlled both at stations and at the WRMC. The original 1-min irradiance statistics will be stored at the WRMC for 10 years, while hourly mean values will be transferred to the World Radiation Data Center in St. Petersburg, Russia. The BSRN, consisting of 15 stations, covers the earth's surface from 80°N to 90°S, and will soon be joined by seven more stations. The data are available to scientific communities in various ways depending on the communication environment of the users. The present article discusses the scientific base, organizational and technical aspects of the network, and data retrieval methods; shows various application possibilities; and presents the future tasks to be accomplished.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842740233

Methods: Subjects were 27 previously sedentary pregnant women (exercised group, EG). A sedentary control group (CG, N = 20) was also studied. Subjects were tested at rest and during upright cycle ergometry at three steady-state power outputs (~20, 45, and 65 W) at the start of the second TM (ENTRY), at the end of the second and third TMs (post-training), and 3 months postpartum (PP, nonpregnant control). Results: Significant reductions in exercise HR were observed in the EG at each exercise level, confirming achievement of an aerobic conditioning effect. In both groups the ventilatory equivalent for oxygen (V(E)/VO2) was significantly higher at all work rates during pregnancy compared with that during PP. This effect was caused by significantly higher exercise tidal volumes (Vτ) at each work rate in both groups during pregnancy versus PP. Respiratory sensitivity as reflected by the ventilatory equivalent for carbon dioxide (V(E)/VCO2) and calculated arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2) was significantly increased at all three work rates in late gestation versus PP and increased slightly with advancing gestational age in both groups. The main effects of physical conditioning were attenuation of increases in V(E)/VO2 observed at all exercise levels between the end of TM2 and TM3 and reductions in respiratory perception of effort (RPEr) between ENTRY and the end of TM3. Attenuation of increases in V(E)/VO2 during TM3 in the EG was attributed to the combined effects of enhanced fat versus carbohydrate utilization (resulting in reduced CO2 output and drive to ventilate) and attenuation of pregnancy-induced increases in dead space ventilation in late gestation. Conclusion: The study results support the hypothesis that physical conditioning reduces both ventilatory demand and respiratory perception of effort in late gestation.","Chronic exercise; Human gestation; Pulmonary ventilation; Respiratory control","carbohydrate; carbon dioxide; fat; oxygen; adult; article; bicycle ergometry; controlled study; exercise; female; fitness; heart rate; human; lung ventilation; normal human; pregnancy; respiration control; second trimester pregnancy; third trimester pregnancy; Adult; Carbon Dioxide; Dyspnea; Exercise Test; Exercise Therapy; Female; Heart Rate; Humans; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, Second; Pregnancy Trimester, Third; Pulmonary Ventilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031896071

There are various reasons for this trend: Physical models allow deeper insights compared to heuristic functions, controllers can be designed faster and more accurately, and the possibility of obtaining an automated application scheme for the final engine to be controlled is a significant advantage. Another reason is that if physical effects can be separated, higher order models can be applied for different subsystems. This is in contrast to heuristic functions where the determination of the various maps poses large problems and is thus only feasible for low order models. One of the most important parts of an engine management system is the air-to-fuel control. The catalytic converter requires the mean air-to-fuel ratio to be very accurate in order to reach its optimal conversion rate. Disturbances from the active carbon filter and other additional devices have to be compensated. Emission-optimal warm-up strategies require the engine to be run slightly lean without misfires. All these tasks cannot be fulfilled with the feedback controller only but also need a very good feedforward strategy. Such a feedforward strategy usually inverts the known plant dynamics. One important part of the fuel dynamics is the wall-wetting dynamics, i.e., the fact that not all the fuel injected enters the cylinder during the following intake valve opening. First-order approximations of these dynamics are frequently used. Their advantage is that they are easy to implement in an inverse dynamic feedforward strategy and that the parameters can be determined quite simply. However, the wall-wetting dynamics are not sufficiently described by first-order approximations. New engine management systems increasingly are fitted with wide-range sensors. Due to a smaller time constant, these sensors allow the detection of higher-frequency phenomena and also yield quantitative information on the air-to-fuel ratio (lambda). Mounted closely to the exhaust valve, these sensors also allow a better identification of the wall-wetting dynamics. A second-order model shows very good performance. It can be fitted into the frequency response measurements with a nonlinear optimization routine. The scheme for the parameter identification presented here does two things: It highlights certain problem areas which require special attention and it describes the parameter maps for the operating region at two different cylinders of an SI engine. Finally, some measurements taken on the cold engine are shown and interpreted. © Copyright 1997 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Catalytic converters; Controllers; Dynamics; Frequency response; Fuel purification; Fuels; Heuristic algorithms; Inverse problems; Nonlinear programming; Wetting; Automated applications; Engine control applications; Engine management systems; First-order approximations; Frequency response measurement; Model-based control schemes; Non-linear optimization; Quantitative information; Engine cylinders",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072481072

Existence of the problem for vertical cavities has been previously demonstrated in connection with electron beam pumped lasers [2] and LED [3]. The effect results in increasing threshold and a reduction of efficiency of the devices [2]. Prilimenary estimation shows importance of the problem for large diameter VCSEL as well [4]. Thus, suppression of the in-plane emission gives a way of improvement of VCSEL operational characteristics. Features of the spontaneous emission (SE) pattern is a basis for simulation and modelling of the effect. In this paper the SE is considered for both λ- and λ/2- cavities in the framework of a planar multilayer structure model taking into account the QW optical spectrum. The model is suitable for large diameter VCSELs with weak radial boundaries and allows the consideration of both in-plane and vertical propagating modes. Results of calculation show that, for a λ/2- cavity, all in-plane propagating modes have weak coupling to a dipole of the active region (QW), unlike the λ- cavity case where there is a mode having a field maximum in the position of QW and thus strong dipole coupling. This leads to a 2-4 times reduction of spontaneous emission in the in-plane direction for the λ/2- cavity. However, this is still comparable with the SE in ""vertical"" modes and therefore can not be neglected, as is usually assumed. The ""vertical"" modes in general propagate at different angles to the ""pure vertical direction"" and hence have an in-plane component of the propagation constant. Analysis shows the ""pure"" vertical part of the SE to be extremely small compared to the total. Thus, the in-plane component of the SE should be taken into account to improve VCSEL design.",,"Electron beams; Emission spectroscopy; Modal analysis; Optical materials; Optical multilayers; Optoelectronic devices; Paper; Photonics; Pumping (laser); Semiconductor quantum wires; Surface emitting lasers; Active regions; Dipole couplings; Emission distributions; Large diameters; Multilayer structures; Operational characteristics; Optical spectrums; Plane directions; Propagating modes; Propagation constants; Simulation and modelling; VCSEL designs; Vertical cavities; Vertical directions; Weak couplings; Spontaneous emission",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57649085949

Data from chemical and microbial tracers and controls indicate that the interiors of some sidewall cores contained microorganisms indigenous to the rock formation. The cultured microorganisms were composed primarily of saline-tolerant, thermophilic fermenting, Fe(III)-reducing, and sulfate-reducing bacteria (1 to 104 cells/g). The physiological capabilities of the cultured microorganisms are compatible with the temperature (76°C), pressure (32 MPα), and salinity (≈0.8 wt.% NaCl equivalent) in the sampled interval. The petrological data indicated that the strata contain intercrystalline pores of micrometer size, that occur between late diagenetic cement in siltstone and within cross-cutting, mineralized fractures in shale. These pores made up only 0.04% of the rock volume, were mostly gas-filled, and were interconnected by pore throats with diameters &lt;0.04 μm. Because the pore throats are smaller than known bacteria, the cultured microorganisms were probably trapped within the larger pores containing alkaline, brackish, formation water. The total phospholipid fatty acid concentration of the rock samples yielded a cellular concentration equivalent to 4 × 105 cells/g, much greater than had been determined by enumeration of the cultured bacteria. This may have resulted from either inhibition of dephosphorolation reactions within pores filled with reduced gases, such as methane, or the inability to culture &gt;0.1% of the viable bacteria.

This model describes the steady state as well as the transient behavior of the flow and heat transfer during the trap regeneration processes. The trap temperature profile was determined by numerically solving the 2-D unsteady energy equation including the convective, heat conduction and viscous dissipation terms. The convective terms were based on a 2-D analytical flow field solution derived from the conservation of mass and momentum equations (Opris, 1997). The reaction kinetics were described using a discretized first order Arrhenius function. The 2-D term describing the reaction kinetics and particulate matter conservation of mass was added to the energy equation as a source term in order to represent the particulate matter oxidation. The filtration model describes the particulate matter accumulation in the trap. This model includes the diffusion, direct interception, and inertia mechanisms, and are linked together to capture the overall filtration characteristics of the trap (Opris and Johnson, 1998). The effect of trap material proper-ties on trap regeneration behavior was studied with and without a Cu fuel additive for controlled and uncontrolled regeneration tests. The theoretical results compared well to the experimental data. The regeneration model indicated that the fundamental difference between SiC and Cordierite is to be found in the trap design (wall thickness = 0.8 mm for the tested SiC vs. 0.43 mm with Cordierite), and trap material properties (thermal conductivity, density and specific heat where 11 W/m/K, 1600 kg/m3, and 750 J/kgK with SiC, and 0. 1 W/m/K, 1000 kg/m3 and 600 J/ kgK with Cordierite). These differences are largely responsible for the regeneration behavior difference. Using the regeneration model, it was determined that the temperature gradients (dT/dt) for similar conditions, were up to five times larger with Cordierite, when compared to SiC. The regeneration times with SiC were more than twice as long for the tested conditions. These results were also confirmed experimentally (Gantawar et al., 1996 and Awara et al., 1996), and are consistent with the difference in trap design and material properties. For all tested conditions (SiC and Cordierite, with and without the fuel additive, controlled and uncontrolled regeneration tests), the computed results indicated that the regeneration process is driven by the local exhaust gas temperature. Since all regeneration processes were initiated by ramping the engine (flow rates and temperatures) from a low reaction rate condition (∼300°C) to a higher reaction rate condition (&gt;450-500°C), the regeneration process was always initiated at the trap inlet. However, as the local reactions increased the local gas temperatures, and as some of the released energy was convected downstream in the channel, the maximum temperatures were always calculated (and measured) towards the end of the inlet channel indicating a local energy storage. Consequently, the reaction rates increased locally even more, yielding a local particulate oxidation rate higher than the rest of the inlet channel. For all tested cases, the particulate matter was first oxidized towards the end of the inlet channel. As regions of the inlet cell were partially or completely oxidized, the reaction front moved to upstream regions where there was availability of particulate matter. Consequently, the reaction front moved from downstream to upstream locations. The parametric study performed in this research indicated that an optimum trap configuration can be achieved by changing the material properties (e.g. thermal conductivity similar to SiC's and density and specific heat similar to Cordierite's). From a filtration/trap pressure drop point of view, the trap pore size could be increased to approximately 30 μm and a trap porosity of approximately 45%.

This model describes the steady state trap loading, as well as the transient behavior of the flow and filtration processes. The theoretical model includes the effect of a copper fuel additive on trap loading and transient operation. The convective terms were based on a 2-D analytical flow field solution derived from the conservation of mass and momentum equations. The filtration theory incorporated in the time dependent numerical code included the diffusion, inertia, and direct interception mechanisms. Based on a measured upstream particle size distribution, using the filtration theory, the downstream particle size distribution was calculated. The theoretical filtration efficiency, based on particle size distribution, agreed very well (within 1%) with experimental data for a number of different cases. The filtration model was used to predict the overall as well as individual (particulate layer and porous wall) filtration efficiency. These results indicated that the first 30-45 minutes of trap loading represent a transient state for the filtration characteristics of the trap. In the beginning, when the trap is clean, the filtration efficiency is based on the filtration characteristics of the clean wall. As particles are being deposited on the wall surface, as well as within the wall, the filtration characteristics change to the point where the particulate layer (or filter cake) becomes the dominant filtration medium. While the mass model gives a bulk analysis of the particulate matter in the trap, the developed filtration model was used to determine the change in porous wall porosity and permeability as a function of particles retained in the wall, and on the wall surface. This analysis allows for a better description of where the particulate matter is deposited, which in turn is crucial for the discrete definition of the reaction (source) term in the energy equation. A general semiheuristic power law approach for determining the particulate matter properties was developed. This relationship relates the particulate layer porosity to the amount of mass present in the trap and the trap pressure drop. Based on the calculated particulate layer porosity, analytical relationships can be used to determine the particulate layer permeability and density. A general analytical solution for the trap pressure drop was developed. This analytical relationship can be used to determine the clean trap pressure drop. The loaded trap pressure drop can also be determined using this analytical relationship in conjunction with knowledge about the trapped particulate matter and its properties as given by the power law relationship for particulate layer porosity. The parametric study indicated that the trap wall porosity, pore size, and wall thickness are the main parameters controlling the trap pressure drop and filtration processes. The particulate layer permeability was determined using the Rumpf and Gupte's analytical relationship, which relates the permeability of a porous layer to its porosity and pore size. Results obtained with this model indicated that the particulate layer permeability follows a similar trend as its porosity, and, on average, is approximately 3 orders of magnitude lower than the permeability of a clean trap. This finding indicates that the pressure drop across the trap is extremely sensitive to the amount of particulate matter in the trap. The particulate layer porosity during steady state loading was on average 45-50%, but varied nonlinearly from 20% to approximately 65% with the copper fuel additive and from 10% to approximately 60% without the fuel additive. Based on these values, it was determined that the particulate layer density ranges from 1600 kg/m3 (initially, when the trap is clean) to 700 kg/m 3 with the fuel additive, and from 1800 kg/m3 to 800 kg/m3 without the copper fuel additive.

These expressions are inefficient, however, for forward pumping, when the parameter q approaches unity (typical for single clad fibres). An alternative form of the expressions is presented, which is also useful in that region. Furthermore, the analysis is extended to include systems such as Yb3+ doped fibres, for which the pumping efficiency is reduced due to stimulated emission at the pump wavelength of λp. © IEE, 1998.","Fibre amplifiers; Pump efficiency; Pump wavelength; Signal amplification","Amplification; Approximation theory; Computer simulation; Light emission; Optical pumping; Strongly pumped fiber amplifiers; Fiber lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032045646

To alleviate this problem, a low atomic number (Z) target was implemented on our Siemens MXE linear accelerator. This investigational system was used to assess the performance of various target materials by filming an aluminum contrast object. Beryllium, carbon and conventional target materials were studied. The bremsstrahlung spectra of these materials were simulated using Monte Carlo techniques. These spectra were used to calculate the dependence of narrow beam contrast on phantom thickness for verification of the data measured from film. A Monte Carlo simulation of the beryllium spectrum in a wide beam geometry was used to evaluate the effect of phantom-to-film distance on contrast. Although the same degree of contrast improvement with distance was not realized in practice, the improvement in image quality rivaled that achieved using a scatter reduction grid. A comparison of conventional localization images of the head and neck of an anthropomorphic phantom with images produced with a beryllium or carbon target and a mammography film and screen system supports earlier suggestions that the technique is clinically useful.","Contrast; Portal imaging; Scatter; Stereotactic radiotherapy","Atoms; Beryllium; Carbon; Monte Carlo methods; Phantoms; Radiotherapy; Scattering; Anthropomorphic phantoms; Contrast; Contrast improvements; Mammography films; Megavoltage imaging; Monte Carlo techniques; Portal imaging; Stereotactic radiotherapy; Image enhancement; aluminum; beryllium; carbon; article; image quality; linear accelerator; mammography; mathematical analysis; megavoltage radiation; phantom; priority journal; radiation scattering; radiosurgery; stereotaxic surgery; system analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031790999

Current national standards are set for PM10 (particles less than 10 μm in diameter) and new standards have been promulgated for PM2.5 (particles less than 2.5 μm in diameter). Both particle sizes have been associated with mortality and morbidity in studies in the United States and elsewhere and an unambiguously safe level of ambient PM has been difficult to identify. PM10 concentrations have been reduced significantly in U.S. cities over the past two decades and relatively few locations continue to exceed national PM10 standards. However, the new PM2.5 standards will require further reductions in PM concentrations and additional expenditures for emission controls. Information about the health and economic benefits of achieving lower PM concentrations is important because: (1) expected costs of further PM reductions rise after the least-cost options are exhausted, and (2) there is uncertainty about the existence of a threshold safe level for PM. This paper develops and applies a methodology for quantifying the health benefits of potential reductions in ambient PM. Although uncertainties exist about several components of the methodology, the results indicate that the annual nationwide health benefits of achieving the new standards for PM2.5 relative to 1994-1996 ambient concentrations are likely to be between $14 billion and $55 billion annually, with a mean estimate of $32 billion.",,"air pollution; health impact; medical geography; pollution control; acute respiratory tract disease; air pollution; air quality standard; ambient air; article; asthma; chronic bronchitis; emergency ward; health economics; hospital admission; human; morbidity; mortality; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; public health; United States; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032006291

The disk specimen is made by quenching the pre-formed specimen into water after heating it in an Ar flow. The area ratio of the amorphous region is measured by image processing of the image given by an optical microscope. The ratio depends on the temperature before quenching of the alloy and on the added amounts of boron or carbon. In the case of B addition, the area ratio of the amorphous region sensitively depends on the quenched temperature and the amount of the addition. In the case of C addition, the ratio becomes almost 100% at the quenching temperature from 953 to 1113 K with the addition from 1.5 to 5 at%.

We have developed geographically-resolved estimates of annual average mercury emission rates from current anthropogenic sources in the 48 contiguous United States. These estimates were made by applying emission factors to individual facility operating data and to county-wide source activity levels. We apportioned the emissions to an Eulerian modeling grid system using point source coordinates and the fractions of county areas in each grid cell. Point sources account for about 89% of the 48-state total mercury emissions of 146.4 Mg/yr. Most of the emissions in the inventory are from combustion of mercury-containing fossil fuels and municipal waste, located primarily in the mid-Atlantic and Great Lakes stares as well as in the Southeast. The major uncertainties in the emission estimates are caused by uncertainties in the emission factors used to develop the estimates. This uncertainty is likely a result of variability in the mercury content of the combusted materials and in the removal of mercury by air pollution control devices. The greatest research need to reduce uncertainties in mercury emission estimates is additional measurements to improve emission factors.","Emission factor; Emissions; Inventory; Mercury; Operating rate; Sources; Uncertainty","Emission factors; Eulerian modeling grid system; Industrial emissions; Mathematical models; Mercury (metal); Particulate emissions; Air pollution; fossil fuel; mercury; antropogenic activity; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; emissions inventory; mercury; mercury emissions; pollution monitoring; air pollution; air pollution control; article; geographic distribution; model; united states; USA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031933045

Monolithic organic resorcinol-formaldehyde aerogels (carbogels) can easily be made using the sol to gel method accompanied by the supercritical drying process using liquid CO2 (critical temperature = 31°C). Thereafter, these copolymer monolithic carbogels are pyrolysed in an atmosphere of N2 at 1050°C for 3 hours, in order to obtain monolithic carbon carbogels. The carbon carbogels are impregnated by H2PtCl6 to obtain a weight % of metal equal to 0.44.

We observed near-IR H2 (1, 0) S(1), (2, 1) S(1), and (5, 3) O(3) lines and the 12CO J = 1 → 0 line from 30 Doradus and N159/N160 in the Large Magellanic Cloud and from DEM S 16, DEM S 37, and LI-SMC 36 in the Small Magellanic Cloud. We find that the H2 emission is UV-excited and that (weak) CO emission always exists (in our surveyed regions) toward positions where H2 and [C II] emission have been detected. Using a PDR code and a radiative transfer code, we simulate the emission of line radiation from spherical clouds and from large planar clouds. Because [C II] emission and H2 emission arise on the surface of the cloud and because the lines are optically thin, these lines are not affected by changes in the relative sizes of the neutral cloud and the CO-bearing core, while the optically thick CO emission can be strongly affected. The sizes of clouds are estimated by measuring the deviation of CO emission strength from that predicted by a planar cloud model of a given size. The average cloud column density, and therefore its size, increases as the metallicity decreases. Our result agrees with the photoionization-regulated star formation theory of McKee. © 1998.

The ratio of photoacoustic signals obtained from diseased and healthy leaves in the UV region was higher, as compared to that in the visible region. In fungal infections, the higher PA signal was attributed to non-radiative de-excitation (heat emission). In case of viral infection, the signal appears affected by both 02 evolution and heat emission. The PA spectra of leaves show that the heat emission due to non-radiative de-excitation exceeds the 02 evolution.

A regular grid of 800 measuring points has been incorporated into a cuvette to observe the spatial and temporal distribution of PAR incident on the needles of a twig along with simultaneous measurements of the CO2 exchange in order to determine the dependence of photosynthesis on PAR. It was shown that large errors can result if the photosynthetic rate is estimated using the mean value of PAR instead of the instantaneous values of PAR detected at given points in the region of the needles. The results demonstrate that the obtained regression between the CO2 exchange rate estimated using the multipoint PAR measuring system and the measured CO2 exchange rate is as good within a canopy as in unshaded conditions.","Carbon dioxide; Instrumentation; Measurement; Photosynthetically active radiation","canopy; carbon dioxide; instrumentation; measurement method; photosynthetically active radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032449935

The chosen system consisted of europium(III) nitrate and 1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane (cyclam) in a 4:1 mixture (v/v) of methanol and dimethylsulfoxide. The complex formed is reduced at glassy carbon electrodes at -1.4V vs. the reference electrode used. The complex stoichiometry is 1:1. The formation constant in the presence of supporting electrolyte (0.1M tetrabutylammonium perchlorate), logβ=3.3, has been determined in the usual manner using a glassy carbon electrode.Under the conditions of the absence of excess supporting electrolyte, reduction wave height of the Eu3+ ion depends on concentration of electroinactive ions in the way predicted by the Myland-Oldham theory.The complex stoichiometry (1:1) and the complex formation constant (logβ=3.2), in the absence of supporting electrolyte, have been determined by nonlinear curve-fitting of the steady-state currents measured at a gold microelectrode for various concentrations of the ligand. A good agreement of these two values supports the theoretical model presented in the previous paper of this series.

The deduced papA coding region was 1278 nucleotides long, interrupted by a single 71 bp intron. The corresponding amino acid sequence presented a high degree of similarity to other aspartyl proteases. Sequence analysis and proteolytic activity measurement suggested that the podosporapepsin could be intracellular rather than secreted. The papA gene was expressed under carbon starvation, but not under nitrogen starvation conditions. Its disruption led to a slight decrease in the growth rate of the mutant strain when bovine serum albumin was the sole carbon source in the medium. Disruption or overexpression of papA gene had no obvious consequence on vegetative incompatibility. Transcription of papA induced by carbon starvation was strongly reduced in the presence of a suppressor of vegetative incompatibility. This result suggests a relationship between adaptation for starvation and vegetative incompatibility.","eapA; papA; Transcriptional regulation; Vegetative incompatibility","aspartic proteinase; bovine serum albumin; carbon; amino acid sequence; article; enzyme activity; fungal genetics; fungus; fungus mutant; gene disruption; gene induction; growth rate; intron; molecular cloning; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; protein degradation; sequence homology; transcription regulation; Amino Acid Sequence; Aspartic Endopeptidases; Base Sequence; Cloning, Molecular; Culture Media; Fungal Proteins; Fungi; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sequence Homology, Amino Acid; Transcription, Genetic; Bovinae; Fungi; Podospora anserina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032571557

The keys to successfully meeting these challenges and responsibilities are education, cooperation, and the ability to be creative in the quest for solutions to problems of ever-increasing complexity. Experience in detecting and analyzing test results, which is gained over time, enhances the skills that clinical engineering professionals bring to this challenge. Attention to EMI risks has been influenced by a number of factors, including a spirit of cooperation between manufacturers and users, concerns over patient care and perceived product efficacy, and an increasing number of regulations by European and U.S. regulatory agencies. As a result, device emissions are being reduced and device immunity to EMI is improving. Further improvements in device immunity are still needed. The radio spectrum with regard to intentional radiators is in a continual state of flux. As industry attempts to improve labor efficiency through the use of radio communications, new and higher-powered sources of RF - both internal and external to the physical plant - appear each day in the clinical environment. Since the distance between intentional radiators and potentially susceptible devices is usually beyond the control of an institution, industry must continue to reduce device susceptibility. There should be a stronger dialogue between institutions (even if they do not have proactive EMI reduction programs) and manufacturers to identify ways to improve device immunity to EMI and to increase product designers' and users' awareness of potential problems.",,"biomedical engineering; electromagnetic field; microprocessor; patient monitoring; reliability; review; Biomedical Engineering; Cooperative Behavior; Electromagnetic Fields; Electromagnetics; Electronics, Medical; Electrostatics; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure; Equipment Safety; Europe; Humans; Interdepartmental Relations; Maintenance and Engineering, Hospital; Materials Management, Hospital; Patient Care; Radio Waves; Risk Factors; Telemetry; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031897985

Under displacement controlled quasi-static loading the response is characterized by a relatively sharp rise to a load maximum followed by a drop down to an extended load plateau which is then terminated by a sharp rise in load. In the initial rising part of the response, the deformation is essentially uniform throughout the specimen. Following the load maximum, the deformation localizes in a narrow zone of cells. These cells collapse in a shear-type mode until contact between cell walls arrests their deformation and causes spreading of the deformation to the neighboring rows of cells where the process is repeated. This propagation of the collapsed zone occurs at a relatively constant load and continues until all the rows of cells have collapsed. As a result of the rate dependence of the material, the initiation and propagation stresses increase as the rate of crushing of the honeycomb is increased. This process of crushing has been simulated numerically using appropriately nonlinear kinematics. An elastic-powerlaw viscoplastic constitutive rule, calibrated to uniaxial experiments spanning strain rates of six decades, is used to model the behavior of the polycarbonate. In addition, the model is capable of treating contact between cell walls which result from crushing. Results from analyses involving a characteristic cell and from full scale simulations of the experiments are presented which are shown to be in excellent agreement with the experimental results. © Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Compression testing; Deformation; Elasticity; Kinematics; Mathematical models; Polycarbonates; Structural analysis; Viscoplasticity; In-plane crushing; Quasi-static loading; Honeycomb structures",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031623448

Since one can experimentally control the two delay times as well as the two IR field frequencies, it is possible to extract vital information on the vibrational relaxation in time domain as well as the intra- and intermolecular vibrational mode couplings in frequency domain.

During this state, there was only marginal effect on K(m) for PEP, while the affinity of PEPC to Mg2+ increased by &gt;2 fold. In contrast, the sensitivity of PEPC to malate decreased with increasing concentration of HCO3. Similarly, the stimulation by glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P) at optimal concentration (10 mM) of HCO3/- was much less than that at suboptimal concentration (0.05 mM). K(i) for malate increased by about 3 fold and K(a) for G-6-P rised by fourfold as bicarbonate concentration was rised from 0.05 to 10 mM. These results suggest that HCO3/- desensitizes PEPC to both malate and G-6-P. Further, these changes were manifested in both dark- as well as light-forms of the enzyme. Similar results were obtained with PEPC in leaf extracts or in purified form. We therefore propose that bicarbonate-induced changes are independent of phosphorylation and possibly through a significant change in the conformation of the enzyme. This is the first detailed report indicating marked modulation of regulatory and catalytic properties of PEPC by bicarbonate, one of its substrate.","Amaranthus hypochondriacus; Bicarbonate; Malate sensitivity; Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; Regulatory properties","bicarbonate; enzyme activity; enzyme conformation; enzyme kinetics; enzyme phosphorylation; enzyme substrate; glucose 6 phosphate; malic acid; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; Amaranthus hypochondriacus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032455205

Hydrocarbon reactivity was successfully incorporated into the LEV/CF regulation by developing RAF's. The RAF's definition allows for reduction of many of the uncertainties associated with the hydrocarbon reactivity estimates. Other categories of compounds may not allow for similar reductions in uncertainties and it will be more difficult to use their reactivities in developing regulations with the current state of the science. This is the case with the consumer product regulations currently being developed. To aid the ARB in appropriately incorporating hydrocarbon reactivity into the regulatory process, expert panels have been formed and further research into reactivity is underway.

These mixtures have been found to be very effective in increasing the tissue oxygen tension, especially at high oxygen partial pressures, and many experimental observations exist in the literature in support of this fact. The explanations for these observations are still speculative and unquantified, however. In this work, models have been developed to describe oxygen transport in uniform and nonuniform mixtures of blood and PFCs. For the latter case, the extreme situation of central migration of erythrocytes is considered, wherein the erythrocytes occupy the central core region of the vessel surrounded by a plasma annulus. The predictions of the proposed models have been examined using a fixed wall oxygen tension, and the oxygen transport characteristics of mixtures have been presented with reference to blood alone. It was found that at high oxygen tensions the addition of PFCs significantly increases the oxygen wall flux into the tube. This increased flux, coupled with effects of competing oxygen sinks (erythrocytes and PFC droplets), leads to an anomalous increase in the average oxygen tension for short distances from the tube entrance. It has been shown that a near wall excess of PFC droplets is not necessary to cause this increase, as mentioned by Vaslef and Goldstick. For longer distances, however, the addition of PFCs leads to a decrease in the average oxygen tension.The oxygen transport in uniform and non-uniform mixtures of blood and perfluorocarbon (PFC) emulsions was studied. At high oxygen tensions, the addition of PFCs increased the oxygen wall flux in the vessels.

Several aspects of the metal/ion bonding such as the adsorbate binding energy, charge transfer to/from the metal and the relaxation of the adsorbates upon adsorption are investigated. On the hollow site of Ag(110) bicoordinated carbonate has a binding energy of 226.9 kcal/mol. The highest binding energies for carbonate are obtained on Ag(110) while on Ag(111) and Ag(100) comparable binding energies are observed. The bicarbonate ion has a binding energy of 74.0 kcal/mol bicoordinated on the hollow site of Ag(100). The binding energy of bicoordinated CO3 is 117 kcal/mol on Ag(100). There is a charge transfer towards the metal of 0.5 electrons in the case of carbonate and 0.25 electrons for bicarbonate. On the other hand, CO3 adsorption leads to a charge transfer of 1.5 electrons from the metal to the adsorbate. Adsorbed carbonate and carbon trioxide have the same formal charge of -1.5 electrons and the same geometry, which is very close to that of carbonate compounds.

Eclipse, a product of the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company (RJR), was commercialized in June of 1996. Eclipse is unlike conventional cigarettes in that, like its predecessor Premier, it is designed to heat and not burn tobacco. The purpose of Eclipse was to simplify the chemical composition and reduce the biological activity of the mainstream and sidestream smoke and to achieve a significant reduction of environmental tobacco smoke. In Eclipse, tobacco pyrolysis is reduced by a carbon fuel rod that serves as a heat source for generating an aerosol having nicotine and tobacco flavor. The carbon rod, at the tip of the cigarette, is insulated and bound with two wrapping mats of glass fibers. Recently, Eclipse has been modified to address consumer complaints of burdensome draw and off-taste. The redesigned Eclipse, which we have termed the NEW Eclipse, has an unconventional filter-appearing mouthpiece that consists of a cellulose acetate cylindrical bundle with a central hollow tunnel. In our analysis of Eclipse, glass fibers (length:width aspect ratio, ≥3:1) were: (a) observed protruding from the tip; (b) identified on the white cigarette wrapping paper; (c) viewed on the surface of the cork-appearing tipping paper; (d) found in the pack residue; (e) discovered lying freely on the cut surface of the filter by both light and electron microscopy; (f) harvested from the filter with adhesive tape; and (g) displaced when Eclipse was smoked mechanically. In a study of Eclipse that had not been removed from carefully opened packs, we observed that ≥95% of the filters were contaminated with glass fibers (Eclipse: Regular, n = 114/120, 95%; Milds, n = 118/120, 98%; Menthol, n = 120/120, 100%). Likewise, 99% of NEW Eclipse had glass fibers on the redesigned filter (Regular, n = 119/120). In contrast, glass fibers were never observed on the filters of conventional United States filter cigarettes that had been used as controls (n = 0/120, 0%). In a study of Eclipse (n = 60), the number of glass fibers contaminating the filter surface ranged from 5 to 55. Glass fibers as well as fiber fracture items [aspect ratio, <3:1 (e.g., particles, fragments, bits, chips, flakes, specks, and dust)] were discovered in the pack residue. The average number of glass fibers in the residue of a pack of Eclipse was 7,548 (SE ± 3443; range, 1,164 to 26,725 glass fibers/pack; n = 7 packs). The thin and fragile glass fibers of the insulation mats had most likely been broken and fragmented in the high-speed multiple-step Eclipse manufacturing operation. Invariably, puffing on Eclipse discharged glass fibers and glass particles from the filter into the smoker's month. Subsequently, the bioresistant glass fibers and microscopic glass dust are inhaled and/or ingested. Contamination of Eclipse filters with glass fibers and glass dust poses a potential and unnecessary health hazard to uninformed consumers. Eclipse is a paradigm of the health danger that may be imposed by technically complex tobacco articles and nicotine delivery devices promoted by an unregulated industry to smokers worldwide, many of whom are addicted to nicotine and who seek a less hazardous cigarette.",,"glass fiber; aerosol; article; chemical composition; cigarette smoking; filter; health hazard; pollution; priority journal; pyrolysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031762054

Also included are special topic papers relating to soil C sequestration and results from other experiments on management effects on SOM. Together, the papers integrate results from more than 50 long-term field experiments, providing a unique information base on the impacts of management practices on SaM across different sets of climate and soil conditions. This information is of great value not only for addressing long-standing issues of soil fertility and agroecosystem sustainability, but also for its use in assessing the potential for soils to act as a C sink to mitigate increasing CO 2 emissions to the atmosphere.","Agricultural field experiments; C sequestration; Crop management; Long-term agricultural experiments; Mitigation of CO 2 emissions; Soil C storage; Soil organic matter; Tillage","assessment method; carbon sequestration; organic matter; soil; sustainability; tillage",Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032490668

Yet there are major opportunities for mitigation of CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions through changes in the use and management of agricultural lands. Agricultural mitigation options can be broadly divided into two categories: (I) Strategies to maintain and increase stocks of organic C in soils (and biomass), and (ii) reductions in fossil C consumption, including reduced emissions by the agricultural sector itself and through agricultural production of biofuels to substitute for fossil fuels. Reducing the conversion of new land to agriculture in the tropics could substantially reduce CO2 emissions, but this option faces several difficult issues including population increase, land tenure and other socio-political factors in developing countries. The most significant opportunities for reducing tropical land conversions are in the humid tropics and in tropical wetlands. An important linkage is to improve the productivity and sustainability of existing agricultural lands in these regions. Globally, we estimate potential agricultural CO2 mitigation through soil C sequestration to be 0.40.9 Pg C y-1, through better management of existing agricultural soils, restoration of degraded lands, permanent 'set-asides' of surplus agricultural lands in temperate developed countries and restoration of 10-20% of former wetlands now being used for agriculture. However, soils have a finite capacity to store additional C and therefore any increases in C stocks following changes in management would be largely realized within 50-100 years. Mitigation potential through reducing direct agricultural emissions is modest, 0.01-0.05 Pg C y-1. However, the potential to offset fossil C consumption through the use of biofuels produced by agriculture is substantial, 0.5-1.6 Pg C y-1, mainly through the production of dedicated biofuel crops with a smaller contribution (0.2-0.3 Pg C y-1) from crop residues. Many agricultural mitigation options represent 'win-win' situations, in that there are important side benefits, in addition to CO2 mitigation, that could be achieved, e.g. improved soil fertility with higher soil organic matter, protection of lands poorly suited for permanent agriculture, cost saving for fossil fuel inputs and diversification of agricultural production (e.g. biofuels). However, the needs for global food production and farmer/societal acceptability suggest that mitigation technologies should conform to: (I) The enhancement of agricultural production levels in parts of the world where food production and population demand are in delicate balance and (ii) the accrual of additional benefits to the farmer (e.g., reduced labor, reduced or more efficient use of inputs) and society at large.","Agriculture; Biofuels; C-sequestration; Mitigation potential; Soil C","agricultural emission; agricultural management; biogeochemical cycle; carbon dioxide; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031713260

The analyses were made on data sets from a collaborative project using literature values for the rates of production of heat, moisture and carbon dioxide. For heat and moisture production, it was found that the balance equations could be improved by including a correction for evaporation of water from fresh food, faeces and urine in livestock buildings, and by adjustment of the equations for partitioning total heat into sensible and latent heat for pigs and poultry. The correction, which is valid for climatic regions and production schemes that exist in Northern Europe, was calculated for each building in such a way that the heat and moisture balances gave the same ventilation rate. The three methods gave reliable results on a 24 h basis, except when there were small hourly differences between indoor and outdoor temperature (less than 2°C), absolute humidity (less than 0.5 × 10-3 kg of water/m3) and carbon dioxide concentration (less than 200 p.p.m.). On a 24 h basis the correlation coefficient (r2) between the ventilation rate based on carbon dioxide and on heat and moisture was 0.67 (p &lt; 0.01) for fattening pigs and 0.90 (p &lt; 0.001) for laying hens and dairy cows. For periods shorter than 24 h, a correction was needed for diurnal changes in animal heat, moisture and carbon dioxide production to achieve good agreement between calculated and measured ventilation rates. © 1998 Silsoe Research Institute.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001780047

Responses from a sample of 441 individuals to statements drawn from the public discourse on environmental issues are used to classify respondents according to the cultural types posited by CT. Analysis indicates that most respondents mix elements of CT's egalitarianism, hierarchy, and individualism, though many individuals clearly lean toward one or another of the cultural types. There seems to be a melding of individualistic and hierarchic elements in opposition to egalitarian elements. Definitions of what is natural, fair and right - of equity - are fundamental issues between cultures, and non-coercive resolution of issues may be promoted by exploring cultural interstices, where cosmological boundaries are weakest.

The results show that the simulated average aboveground biomass and net N mineralization were consistent with observed data. The modeled estimates for soil carbon were consistent with those from regional-scale empirical regression models. High correlation (R2 = 0.92) with data was obtained for the simulation of soil carbon dynamics of the boreal forest, but the model overestimated soil carbon (O-20 cm) by 2-8% for fine-textured soil and underestimated soil carbon by 5-18% for sandy soil. The effects of climatic variation on temporal changes in biomass and soil carbon storage over the past century were found to be very different for southern and northern sites but relatively insensitive to site-specific soil texture. The main discrepancies between observed data and CENTURY 4.0 results are associated with the effects of soil texture and an inadequate representation of fire disturbance on C dynamics of boreal forests. Further improvements, particularly in the representation of disturbance regimes and in the simulation of slow pool C dynamics, are suggested to enhance its predictive capability.

The importance of wrack disturbance in northwest Atlantic salt marshes has been a topic of recent debate. The importance of wrack disturbance in southwest Atlantic salt marshes, which experience a very different climate regime than do northern marshes, has rarely been examined. Working in a Georgia salt marsh, we documented a pattern of positive association between wrack and Batis maritima biomass, and conducted experiments that indicated that wrack was beneficial to Batis maritima. Sampling indicated that natural wrack deposition was correlated with areas of vigorous Batis growth and mild soil conditions. Natural wrack deposition occurred primarily at the highest elevations occupied by Batis maritima (the high Batis zone). Batis plants in the high zone were taller, with more and larger leaves, and contained several times the biomass/unit area than Batis plants at lower elevations. High zone soils had lower salinities, better percolation rates, and a lower organic content than did soils from lower elevations. Experimental manipulations demonstrated that deposition of wrack was partially responsible for these patterns. In each of two experiments, soil salinities were lower and plants taller and larger in the presence of wrack compared to in its absence. Although wrack lowered salinities and enhanced plant growth, the effects were not large enough to completely explain the differences between Batis zones. Instead, wrack probably reinforced pre-existing gradients in flooding and salinity caused by differences in elevation and terrestrial runoff. Our results contrast with previous studies from northern marshes. Because of geographic differences in climate and plant phenology, northern marshes are more likely than southern marshes to receive patches of wrack thick enough to kill underlying vegetation. Plants covered by thin layers of wrack, as commonly occurs in southern marshes, may often grow through the wrack rather than suffer mortality. Also because of climatic differences, wrack is more likely to benefit plants by ameliorating salinity stress in southern marshes, where soil salinities are often hypersaline, than in northern marshes where soils are rarely hypersaline. Although ecological processes may differ between northern and southern salt marshes, these differences may be predictable based on an understanding of geographic variation in climate.",,"growth response; plant burial; salinity; saltmarsh; seaweed; Atlanta; United States; algae; Batis maritima; Batis maritima",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032434290

Methods for accurately and efficiently quantifying carbon storage and annual carbon fluxes are needed to determine what role urban forests may have in reducing levels of atmospheric CO2. This will require the development of techniques for estimating foliar and woody biomass of individual trees. In this study, 2 sampling methods and 2 regression formulas for estimating foliar and above-ground woody biomass were tested against the actual above-ground biomass of 8 open-grown deciduous trees (2 species). There was no significant difference between one of the subsampling methods and actual foliar, woody, and total above-ground biomass. There were indications that the method's precision in estimating foliar biomass could be improved by modifying the sampling method.The second sampling method predicted foliar biomass of heavily pruned trees within 8% of actual measurements. For unpruned or lightly pruned trees, one of the regression equations showed no significant difference between estimates of foliar biomass and actual biomass.","Allometry; Carbon; Crown; Subsampling; Surrogate; Urban forest","biomass; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; estimation method; forest ecosystem; urban area",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032231962

By using only NOAA/AVHRR data at hands the proposed method seems able to detect eruptive volcanic clouds as well as long-period trends in stratospheric aerosol loading related to major eruptive events. Several examples of application to different events of volcanic emission are presented; some cases of Etna and Stromboli volcanoes have been investigated and an historical analysis has been performed in order to recognize stratospheric aerosols produced by Mount Pinatubo's eruption. In all cases the technique was able to detect anomalous particle loading in atmosphere, in an automatic way, without need of any specific transmittance model for the atmosphere or ancillary ground-based measurements. The main merit of this new approach is its effectiveness in recognizing field anomalies also in the presence of a highly variable background as well as its intrinsic exportability ensured by the use of thresholds which are local but automatically generate by using only satellite data at hands. By this way the proposed technique can be numbered among the others environmental applications of RAT approach in which it finds its origin. ©2003 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering.","AVHRR; Change detection; Clouds discrimination; RAT; Volcanic aerosols","Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospherics; Clouds; Remote sensing; Satellites; Signal detection; AVHRR; Change detection; Environmental applications; Eruptive events; Ground-based measurements; Historical analysis; New approaches; NOAA/AVHRR; Particle loadings; Pinatubo; Satellite datum; Satellite remote sensing; Stratospheric aerosols; Trends in stratospheric aerosols; Volcanic aerosols; Volcanic clouds; Volcanic emissions; Volcanoes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-60849133041

It is further regarded as having formed at an early stage, by which it is associated with many stratiform lead-zinc ore deposits throughout the world. Examination of the fine-grained stratiform pyrite at the Cu-Pb-Zn mine at Mount Isa, Queensland, however, indicates that at least at this locality, it formed at a much later stage. A textural characteristic of the Mount Isa pyrite is that it normally overprints two generations of carbonaceous cleavage planes. The first of these (S2) is subparallel to bedding and the second (S3) is axial plane to the mesoscopic folds in the mine. The density of pyrite deposition is controlled by zones defined by these cleavages, commonly in association with neomorphic dolomite in adjacent laminae. In correlated finely laminated sequences, the pyrite appears to have overprinted the near bedding-parallel cleavage after complete compaction of the laminite. Most of the fine-grained pyrite is closely associated with other sulfides (sphalerite, galena, and chalcopyrite), although it generally forms in layers adjacent to them. Where there is an overprinting relationship shown between the fine-grained pyrite and other sulfides, the pyrite is paragenetically earlier and either overgrown, or replaced, by the economic sulfides. The overall distribution of fine-grained pyrite not only suggests a strong spatial association with the Cu-Pb-Zn system, but it continues outward, both in the southerly and northerly direction, to form a halo to it. The gross distribution of fine-grained pyrite strongly crosscuts the stratigraphy, with its maximum development around the center of the mine and a progression of concentration to higher stratigraphic levels in the north. This is the same crosscutting direction as the silica-dolomite boundary, the terminations of the lead-zinc ore-bodies, and the copper ore. In addition, a pyrite envelope occurs around the 3000/3500 copper orebodies in the northern footwall. Distribution of sulfur isotope ratios in fine-grained pyrite, on both the microscopic scale using the ion microprobe and also on the scale of deposits using conventional methods, has been used as a major argument for early diagenetic deposition. In particular, the large spread of δ34S values at the HYC deposit, McArthur River, is presumed to result from biogenic sulfate reduction, necessitating depositional processes operating during early diagenesis. This spread is not greatly different from that of the associated economic sulfides, which were interpreted as hydrothermal, suggesting that the fine-grained pyrite was itself hydrothermal. This alternative interpretation may also apply at Mount Isa, where a similar relationship is observed between the sulfur isotope systematics of pyrite and other sulfides. Mount Isa fine-grained pyrite is therefore interpreted to have formed late in the main deformational event that produced mesoscopic structures in the mine sequence, probably by abiogenic sulfate reduction. Thus pyrite formation was ultimately controlled by the same structures as those that controlled the Pb-Zn ores during formation of the S3 cleavage, which are the Paroo-Basement fault system and shear along bedding in well-laminated carbonaceous siltstones.",,"cleavage; geochronology; mineralization; Proterozoic; pyrite; stratiform deposit; Australia; Mount Isa; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032437192

No agreement could be reached on a joint EU target before the distribution of the burden of emission reductions among Member States had been agreed upon. This paper presents a sectoral approach to burden sharing, which incorporates important national circumstances. The three categories distinguished are the power sector, the internationally operating energy-intensive industry and the remaining domestically oriented sectors. Emission allowances are calculated by applying rules, such as a limitation of coal use for power production, minimum requirements for renewable energy, and minimum energy efficiency improvement rates in industry. For the domestic sectors a per capita emission allowance approach is used. The approach is applied to EU Member States to show the distribution of emission reductions for 2010. Also a comparison with other burden differentiation approaches is made. Results of the analysis played an important role in internal EU discussions, resulting in a better understanding among negotiators of differences in national circumstances and their role in emission levels. This improved understanding led to a political agreement on emission reduction targets that are substantially higher than targets Member States had been prepared to accept earlier. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Coarse particle mass concentrations were typically between 10 and 30% of PM-2.5 concentrations. The chemical composition of emissions from power plants, residential space heating, local factories, and motor vehicles was also characterized. The ambient monitoring and source characterization data were then used in receptor modeling calculations, the results of which indicate that residential space heating and power plant emissions accounted for most of fine particle mass concentrations observed during winter air pollution episodes. Motor vehicles, incinerators, and windblown dust contributed to the balance of the fine particle mass.

CH4 is second to carbon dioxide (CO2) the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas. In this article the methodology and results from a study on the reduction potential of alternative waste treatment strategies in mitigating the greenhouse impact are presented. The objective is to provide information to decision makers so that the greenhouse issue can be included in the decision making on waste management strategies. The potential cost-effectiveness of reducing the greenhouse impact of alternative waste treatment strategies in three communities of different size in Finland is assessed. The estimation of the green-house impact includes estimates of the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the amount of carbon (C) stored at landfills (Csink) and the emission savings that can be achieved by using waste for energy production (assumed decrease in the use of fossil fuels). Landfill gas recovery with energy production was found to be the most cost-efficient way in reducing the greenhouse impact from large landfills. Burning of all the waste or the combustible fraction in municipal solid waste (MSW) was also an efficient method to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, especially if the energy produced can reduce the burning of fossil fuels. Emissions from transportation of waste are small compared with the emissions from landfills. Even if the transportation mileage is doubled due to increasing separation and recycling the greenhouse impact of transportation would be only 3 percent of the impact of landfilling the waste. © 1998 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Landfills; Mitigation; Waste",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0010490756

Today, the diesel car plays an important role in Europe; in France, for instance, it is achieving a remarkable market share of about 42 percent, while in the US its market penetration can be neglected. Many questions are expressed concerning the future of diesel powered cars. The question affecting market acceptance is as follows: can the significantly better fuel efficiency of a diesel car outweigh perceived detrimental characteristics? Such unfavorable properties are thought to be low specific power, objectionable noise, higher exhaust emissions (including smoke), and higher vehicle price. These features are closely influenced by the state of passenger car diesel engine technology. This technology state and its potential must be evaluated with respect to current and future demands, for instance, tighter exhaust emission regulations. In addition, the commercial value and consumer acceptance of high fuel economy must be evaluated. It is clear that the ultimate result of weighing the pros and cons will depend not only on technological factors, but also on political factors such as fuel taxation. Regarding the state of technology, the diesel car is very promising. First, by employing a direct injection combustion system, the fuel efficiency can be improved by about 15 percent over current swirl chamber engines. Furthermore, the specific power (hp/ltr) can be increased by efficient supercharging to achieve values of today’s gasoline engines. By tuning the combustion system, low noise engine design features and incorporation of careful noise reduction measures on the vehicle, the noise behavior of a spark ignited vehicle can be reached. Exhaust emissions can currently be reduced to a level to satisfy today’s European and US Tier 1 emission limits. However, significant development effort remains. More stringent emission levels (California US, Tier 2 ULEV, and Stage 3 in Europe) require further advancements in diesel combustion. The strong development potential of 4-valve engines and new unique injection systems is evident. In addition, there are promising developments with lean NOx catalysts and regenerative particulate filters. These technologies offer the potential to meet the very stringent future emission standards. It is anticipated that the sophisticated technology needed to meet these standards will make the future diesel car more expensive compared to a gasoline fueled vehicle. This raises the issue of what price will the consumer pay for the higher fuel economy of a diesel car. In light of the worldwide rapid increase in passenger car population and of the dwindling oil reserves and their global distribution, the fuel efficient diesel engine will play an important role in the future of passenger cars. © 1998 by ASME.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84991691161

In the Seibert analysis, the pH data of the Morvan station were converted to free H+ concentration. The Seibert model, in which it is necessary to relate both samples with the meteorological data, was employed by superimposing the EMEP grid (150 km x 150 km cell size) to the whole geographic region covered by the trajectories. A mean pH was calculated for each grid cell according to a given formula. It was shown that the Seibert model is well suited for identifying source areas of acidity in precipitation. These areas were the ″Black Triangle″ region (where the Czech Republic, Poland, and the former East Germany meet), a region including the Atlantic Ocean and a large part of Western Europe, and an area around the Mediterranean basin (from the south of France until North Africa). A good agreement was seen between the emission inventory and the identified source areas. Analysis of quantitative relationships between the pH and emissions seemed to show that SO2 emissions (&gt; 100 ppm) mainly cause acid rain, demonstrating the strong impact of long-range transport effect on acidity in precipitation.

An overview of the objectives, measurements and major results of this campaign is presented. Measurements of a set of relevant atmospheric trace compounds, including the hydroxyl radical, along with meteorological data were performed to increase the understanding of OH radical chemistry and photo-oxidant formation. Additionally, plant emissions and the exchange of trace gases between a maize field and the atmosphere were investigated. Budgets of selected trace gases were calculated to assess the relative importance of local sources, chemistry or transport. Intercomparisons between measurement techniques were a central issue of POPCORN and included measurements of OH, hydrocarbons, formaldehyde, photolysis frequencies and vertical fluxes. OH radical concentrations were measured simultaneously by LIF (Laser Induced Fluorescence) and DOAS (Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy). Both methods showed good agreement. Maximum OH concentrations were around 107 cm-3 and the diurnal cycles closely followed the rate of primary production via ozone photolysis. Generally, the trace gas composition during POPCORN was characterized by relatively low concentrations of most compounds, e.g. CO: 85-200 ppb, ethane: 0.6-2 pph, and moderate NO(x) levels: 0.5-5 ppb (at noontime). Concentrations of individual biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOC) were mostly well below 100 ppt. However, formaldehyde and acetaldehyde which partly originate from biological sources were observed at mixing ratios of some ppb.","Field campaign; Photo chemistry","formaldehyde; hydrocarbon; hydroxyl radical; ozone; volatile organic compound; atmospheric chemistry; biogenic emission; comparative study; hydroxyl radical; photochemistry; absorption spectroscopy; air pollution; biogenesis; circadian rhythm; fluorescence; Germany; maize; photochemistry; photolysis; review; Germany",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032439935

While there exist many forms of vehicle emissions abatement policies and others have been proposed, formal measures and methods for assessing the relative efficiency and effectiveness of these alternatives are needed. This is particularly the case given the fact that the methods of externality-control most favored by economics (effluent or Pigouvian charges, or the direct taxing of pollutant volume) are generally not feasible for vehicle emissions. In many cases, vehicle pollution control belongs to the realm of the search for the 'best among the second-best' policy alternatives. In this paper the range of policy alternatives used for controlling vehicle emissions is reviewed. A formal methodology for assessing the relative efficiency of alternative policies is proposed, with formal measures that lend themselves to relatively easy quantification for empirical application. It is shown that the most important components of these efficiency assessments are the elasticity of emissions with respect to the 'travel activity' taxed or subsidized by an abatement policy (such as fuel taxes, vehicle taxes, subsidies for public transit, etc.), the impact of the policy upon travel consumer surplus, and the 'noisiness' or the stochastic uncertainty of the relationship between the emissions level and the 'activity' being taxed or subsidized. This last factor makes the abatement policy 'noiser' and less efficient.",,"economic instrument; emissions control; environmental economics; policy evaluation; pollution policy; vehicle emissions; Air pollution; Air pollution control; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Public policy; Regional planning; Vehicles; Pollution abatement; Vehicle emissions; Exhaust gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031594042

The treatments were: open- top chambers with ambient CO2 concentrations (OTC350), open-top chambers with 700 ppm CO2 (OTC700) and ambient air plots without open-top chambers (AA). Measurements of N2O emissions were made weekly starting at anthesis. The measurements continued for ten weeks, until two weeks after the harvest of the mature crop. During the first eight weeks the N2O emissions were higher in the OTC350 treatment compared to OTC700. At the last two measurements, after the plants were harvested, the N2O emissions of the chamber treatments were similar to each other and higher than during the preceding period. The accumulation of grain protein per unit area was higher in OTC700 compared with OTC350. These results suggest that a competition for soil nitrogen exists between plants and the microbial community. The AA plots emitted less N2O during the green canopy period compared with the chamber treatments. After harvest, the emissions from AA increased up to the same magnitude as the chamber treatments. The lower emissions of the ambient air plots during the pre-harvest period can be explained partly by lower ambient temperatures and drier soil.","Carbon dioxide; Nitrogen; Nitrous oxide; Soil; Wheat","carbon dioxide; nitrous oxide; agricultural soil; carbon dioxide enrichment; emission; nitrous oxide; biomass; carbon dioxide measurement; conference paper; denitrification; greenhouse effect; nitrification; pollution; wheat; Triticum aestivum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032428168

The flame shows a distinct triple flame structure in the stabilization region. It is investigated experimentally by PIV for the velocity field, OH-LIPF imaging, C2H(x)-LIF imaging, and a 1D-Raman technique for major species concentrations, combined with a Rayleigh technique for temperature. This is complemented by numerical simulations solving the two-dimensional axisymmetric Navier-Stokes equations in the zero Mach number limit on an adapted mesh, coupled with balance equations for temperature and species. A simplified model for molecular transport properties was used with constant, but non-unity, Lewis numbers for all species. Chemistry is represented by a ten-step reduced mechanism for methane oxidation, which was derived starting from a 61-step elementary mechanism that includes the C1 and C2 chains. The agreement between the measured and the predicted flow field is very satisfactory. Owing to gas expansion, the velocity decreases immediately ahead of the flame and increases strongly at the flame front. Further downstream acceleration due to buoyancy is dominant and is predicted accurately. There is a good agreement between measurements and computations for flame shape and flame length. The measured OH-LIPF image and the computed OH concentrations indicate that OH is concentrated in the vicinity of stoichiometric mixture. The results from a newly developed C2H(x)-LIF method are also supported by calculations. While these measurements were only qualitative, the temperature and mole fractions of the major species could be measured quantitatively with the combined Raman-/Rayleigh technique along a line and were found to agree well with the numerical predictions.

Some of these districts rely upon private sector management and voluntary compliance of employers, employees, and residents in transportation demand management actions that serve to reduce reliance on the single occupant vehicle. The original TMD utilizes public sector management and selected mandatory employer requirements. For subsequent TMDs, the county extensively involves the community throughout the creation process to enhance the chances for long-term success of the initiative. Public acceptance has been good, including support for revenue measures that would make the district self-sufficient. Evaluating the TMD as an effective tool for reducing energy consumption, lowering emissions from mobile sources, and changing travel behaviours rests on two factors. First, the TMD concept must receive the support of elected officials and the community to create and fund it. Second, the TMD must convince private employers to cooperate with it to produce measurable mode share shifts away from the single occupant vehicle.",,"Air pollution control; Energy conservation; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Motor transportation; Social aspects; Taxation; Single occupant vehicles; Transportation management districts; Urban planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031649818

Monterey Bay, Seaside, CA 93955, United States","Interannual variability in flux rates of biogenic trace gases must be quantified in order to understand the differences between short-term trends and actual long-term change in biosphere-atmosphere interactions. We simulated interannual patterns (1983-1988) of global trace gas fluxes from soils using the NASA Ames Research Center version of the Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model in a transient simulation mode. This ecosystem model has been calibrated for simulations driven by satellite vegetation index data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer over the mid-1980s. The predicted interannual pattern of soil heterotropic CO2 emissions indicates that relatively large increases in global carbon flux from soils occurred about 3 years following the strong El Nino-Southern Oscillation event of 1983. Results for the years 1986 and 1987 showed an annual increment of +1 Pg (1015 g) C-CO2 emitted from soils, which tended to dampen the estimated global increase in net ecosystem production with about a 2-year lag period relative to plant carbon fixation. Zonal discrimination of model results implies that 80-90% of the yearly positive increments in soil CO2 emission during 1986-1987 were attributable to soil organic matter decomposition in the low latitudes (between 30°N and 30°S). Soils of the norhtern middle-latitude zone (between 30°and 60°N) accounted for the residual of these annual increments. Total annual emissions of nitrogen trace gases (N2O and NO) from soils were estimated to vary from 2 to 4% over the time period modeled, a level of variability that is consistent with predicted interannual fluctuations in global soil CO2 fluxes. Interannual variability of precipitation in tropical and subtropical zones (30°N to 20°S) appeared to drive the dynamic inverse relationship between higher annual emissions of NO versus emissions of N2O. Global mean emission rates from natural (heterotrophic) soil sources over the period modeled (1983-1988) were estimated at 57.1 Pg C-CO2 yr-1, 9.8 Tg (1012 g) N-NO yr-1, and 9.7 Tg N-N2O yr-1. Chemical fertilizer contributions to global soil N gas fluxes were estimated at between 1.3 to 7.3 Tg N-NO yr-1 and 1.2 to 4.0 Tg N-N2O yr-1.",,"atmosphere-biosphere interaction; biogenic emission; carbon dioxide; ecosystem modeling; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; soil gas; temporal variation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032448534

The results have been obtained from nanoclusters produced deep inside a single crystal diamond irradiated with MeV He ions. The deep implantation creates amorphous sp3 bonded C clusters along the ion tracks, within a largely intact diamond matrix. The matrix maintains the clusters under high pressure, preventing the relaxation to sp2 bonded structures. Sharp peaks associated with defect structures unique to MeV ion implantation are observed at 1422, 1447, 1467, 1496, 1540, 1563, 1631, 1649, 1683 and 1726 cm-1.

The frequency of such events, however, markedly declined in the mid-1970s. To explain this shift, various hydrometeorological conditions that control the severity of river ice break-up were analysed. Specific emphasis was placed on the roles of flow regulation and climate variability. Flow regulation seems to have produced only minor changes in factors such as ice thickness and strength, and not to have reduced the flow at the time of break-up. Moreover, regulation has actually led to an increase in spring flow originating from the headwater region. Since the mid-1970s, however, spring runoff has declined in the downstream portions of the basin unaffected by regulation. This has been linked to a decrease in the magnitude of the winter snowpack. Elevated ice levels and winter flows resulting from regulation have further reduced the potential of tributary rainfall to produce severe break-up floods. Thus the absence of a high-order event between 1974 and 1992 seems to be related to a combined effect of flow regulation and the vagaries of climate.",,"Hydrometeorology; Ice-jam flooding; Climate change; Floods; Flow control; Flow of water; Ice; Meteorology; Rivers; Runoff; Hydrology; climate forcing; delta; flood; ice movement; Canada, Peace-Athabasca Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032147783

Plants fed 1.6 mM NO 3 - had nitrate reductase activity (NRA) comparable to plants fed 16 mM NO 3 - but did not sustain maximum NRA, and had reduced growth. Nitrate reductase (NR) and sucrose phosphate synthase (SPS) activities were not related to year of hybrid release. However, the activation states of NR under low nitrate, and of SPS under high nitrate increased up to 1970 and then leveled off. This suggests a trend towards increased efficiency for both NO 3 - reduction in love nitrate plants, anti sucrose synthesis in high nitrate plants. Chloroplastic glutamine synthetase (GS2) protein did not respond to NO 3 - supply and was not related to year of hybrid release. However, cytosolic glutamine synthetase (GS1) protein was higher in low nitrate plants compared to high nitrate plants. Furthermore, in low nitrate plants, GS1 protein correlated negatively to NRA, indicating that its role was to remobilize N compounds. Phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) activity responded to increased NO 3 - supply and increased up to 1970's, declining thereafter. In most hybrids, PEPC specific activity (activity mg -1 protein . s -1) was higher in the high nitrate plants. The specific activities of NR, SPS and glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) tended to be lower in high nitrate plants, although SPS and GDH activities, expressed on a g fresh weight basis, responded to increased nitrate supply. These observations support the hypothesis that PEPC protein is preferentially increased during the establishment of the C4 syndrome. GDH activity declined over the last 70 years in the low nitrate plants. A negative correlation was found between GDH specific activity and GS2 protein in the high nitrate plants. When trends in enzyme activities were examined over time, it was observed that from the 1930's to the 1970's, breeding for increased grain yield indirectly selected plants with increased PEPC activity and more activated NR and SPS. This trend was not observed in hybrids released during the 1980's and 1990's, indicating that increments in grain yield observed during these last two decades were not due to additional enhancements in nitrate reduction, primary carbon fixation and sucrose metabolism.","Era hybrids; GDH; GS; Maize; NRA; PEPC; SPS","breeding; chloroplast; enzyme activity; glutamate ammonia ligase; maize; nitrate reductase; nitrate; nitrogen assimilating enzyme; nitrogen metabolism; nitrous oxide; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; plant genetics; plant growth; sucrose phosphate synthase; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031857864

The ceria films on YSZ were highly reducible, reacting with CO adsorbed on Rh particles to produce CO2 during TPD. After reduction of the ceria, however, the CO TPD results contained two features: a low-temperature state resulting from desorption of molecular CO and a high-temperature state resulting from the recombination of C and O atoms produced by CO dissociation at lower temperature. The fraction of CO which dissociated on YSZ-supported Rh/ceria increased with the extent of reduction of the ceria surface. TPD studies with isotopically labeled CO demonstrated that the O atoms produced by CO dissociation undergo exchange with oxygen from the ceria lattice.

Faunal, geochemical, and sedimentological evidence shows that the black mats formed in several microenvironments related to spring discharge, ranging from wet meadows to shallow ponds. Small land snails such as Gastrocopta tappaniana and Vertigo berryi are the most common mollusk taxa present. Semiaquatic and aquatic taxa are less abundant and include Catinellids, Fossaria parva, Gyraulus parvus, and others living today in and around perennial seeps and ponds. The ostracodes Cypridopsis okeechobi and Scottia tumida, typical of seeps and low-discharge springs today, as well as other taxa typical of springs and wetlands, are common in the black mats. Several new species that lived in the saturated subsurface also are present, but lacustrine ostracodes are absent. The δ13C values of organic matter in the black mats range from -12 to -26‰, reflecting contributions of tissue from both C3 (sedges, most shrubs and trees) and C4 (saltbush, saltgrass) plants. Carbon-14 dates on the humate fraction of 55 black mats fall between 11,800 to 6300 and 2300 14C yr B.P. to modern. The total absence of mats in our sample between 6300 and 2300 14C yr B.P. likely reflects increased aridity associated with the mid-Holocene Altithermal. The oldest black mats date to 11,800-11,600 14C yr B.P., and the peak in the 14C black mat distribution falls at ∼10,000 14C yr B.P. As the formation of black mats is spring related, their abundance reflects refilling of valley aquifers starting no later than 11,800 and peaking after 11,000 14C yrB.P. Reactivation of spring-fed channels shortly before 11,200 14C yr B.P. is also apparent in the stratigraphic records from the Las Vegas and Pahrump Valleys. This age distribution suggests that black mats and related spring-fed channels in part may have formed in response to Younger Dryas (YD)-age recharge in the region. However, the inception of black mat formation precedes that of the YD by at least 400 14C yr, and hydrological change is gradual, not rapid. © 1998 University of Washington.",,"black mat; late glacial; organic matter; Pleistocene (late); spring; USA, Great Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031823527

In particular we stressed the results obtained at the continuous geochemical monitoring station (GMS I, BAR site), designed by ING for geochemical surveillance of seismic events. The 12/6/1995 (M=3.6-3.8) Roma earthquake together with the 3/11/1995 (M=3.1) Tivoli earthquake was the most energetic events within the Colli Albani - Roma area, after the beginning of the continuous monitoring (1991) up today; strict correlation between these seismic events and fluid geochemical anomalies in groundwater has been discovered (temperature, Eh, 222Rn, CO2, NH3). Separation at depth of a vapour phase, rich in reducing-acidic gases (CO2, H2S, etc...), from a hyper-saline brine, within the deep geothermal reservoir is hypothesised to explain the geochemical anomalies: probably the transtensional episodes accompanying the seismic sequences caused an increasing and/or triggering of the phase-separation process and fluid migration, on the regional scale of the Western sector of the Colli Albani, beyond the seismogenic depth (2-4 Km) up to surface.

Complutense 22, 28040 Madrid, Spain","The present work focuses on the seasonal evolution of suspended particles (TSP and PM10) around the Teruel power station in NE Spain. The specific objectives are the determination of the spatial and time variability of levels of suspended particles, and their relationship with the power plant emissions and other natural or anthropogenic (local or external) particulate sources. The results show a marked seasonal trend, along the study period (July 1995-August 1996) which is characterized by particulate levels that were higher in spring-summer and decreased progressively towards winter. This trend may be related to (a) higher summer oxidation which increased levels of secondary particles, (b) higher convective circulation in summer which raised levels of soil-related particles and anthropogenic particles, (c) higher frequency of intrusion episodes of Sahara air masses in summer and spring, and (d) lower aerosol scavenging potential in summer. The similarity between the seasonal evolutions of daily mean levels of SO2 and particulates is due to the fact that both are partially controlled by the solar cycle. The long range transport particulate inputs affecting this area of the Mediterranean Basin (mainly Sahara air mass intrusions) account for major particulate peaks recorded at the monitoring stations. The influence of the emissions from the power plant in the PM10 and TSP levels is evidenced only in periods with a low background particulate levels. The results demonstrate that even PM10 levels are still highly influenced by the Saharian and European particulate inputs. Therefore, for an accurate environmental assessment, probably PM2.5 should be monitored instead of TSP or PM10, in order to quantify the influence of the power plant emissions on the bulk atmospheric particulate levels. The results obtained from the air back-trajectory analysis and their comparison with the time series of daily PM10 levels allowed the classification of the major external particulate inputs as a function of the particulate levels.","Atmospheric particulates; Mediterranean Basin; Sahara air mass intrusions; Seasonal trend","Atmospheric particulates; Mediterranean basin; Sahara air mass intrusions; Seasonal trend; Suspended particles; Climate change; Coal combustion; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Particulate emissions; Power plants; Suspensions (fluids); Particles (particulate matter); coal; sulfur dioxide; coal; particle; pollution; power station; suspended load; atmospheric pollution; suspended particulate matter; air monitoring; airborne particle; article; desert; electric power plant; priority journal; seasonal variation; spain; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032101857

The specimens were examined for changes in microstructure, and tensile properties. A specimen was also subjected to thermal-ageing under identical conditions to facilitate comparison and resolve the effects of sodium-exposure from mere thermal-ageing. The investigations revealed that, exposure to sodium caused surface morphological changes. A modified layer of 10-15 μm thickness was formed on the surface. This layer was observed to contain ferrite which was attributed to the preferential leaching of nickel. The bulk matrix revealed the generation of a continuous carbide precipitate at the grain boundaries (ditch structure). The thermally-aged specimen also revealed a ditch structure. Tensile tests showed that both the sodium-exposed and thermally-aged materials increased their yield strengths. Analysis of the carbon profile by Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS) indicated that the sodium-exposed surface was depleted in the carbon (to a thickness nearly corresponding to that of the degraded layer). The austenite phase inside the surface degraded region was carburized and a maximum content of the carbon (0.135 mass%) was noticed at a depth of 43 μm from the surface. From the data on the carbon profile, the effective diffusion coefficient of the carbon in the steel was evaluated to be 3.75 × 10-18m2·s-1 (at 823 K). Analysis indicated that the bulk carbon content increased to 0.089 mass% from 0.054 mass%. Based on the results obtained in the present investigation and data available in the literature, the consequences of corrosion by sodium on long-term exposure [(946.7 Ms (30 years), the normal design life of reactor components)] were analyzed. The carbon profile for long duration of exposure to sodium was evaluated by the application of equations based on diffusion laws. The average bulk carbon content after exposure to sodium for 946.7 Ms was estimated to be 0.125 mass%. The influence of carburization on ductility was estimated. The room temperature ductility of 316 Stainless Steel was estimated to be reduced to 39% (from 69% for the as-received material). At elevated temperature (850 K), the ductility was estimated to be reduced to 18%.","Carbon profile; Corrosion; Ductility; Leaching; Liquid sodium; Microstructure; Tensile test; Yield strength","Aging of materials; Ductility; Grain boundaries; Leaching; Microstructure; Morphology; Sodium; Stainless steel; Tensile properties; Tensile testing; Thermal effects; Yield stress; Stainless steel AISI 316; Steel corrosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032026315

This has been variously explained as due to (1) change in the relative mixing proportions of the marine (δ13C = -2O‰) and terrestrial (δ13C = -26‰) organic matter; (2) reduction in the pCO2 of the surface oceans accompanying that in the atmosphere (Rau et al., 1991) and (3) change in the oxic/anoxic conditions in the deep sea environment induced by changes in the surface ocean productivity. While these interpretations may have some merit, we suggest an alternative possibility, viz., a reduced availability of dissolved CO2 in the surface ocean for photosynthesis during glacial times due to (a) a reduction in the atmospheric CO2 concentration (Barnola et al., 1987) and (b) enhanced rates of photosynthesis due to a more vigorous atmospheric circulation in some regions (e.g., Pacific, Pedersen, 1983) or (c) reduced rates of air-sea exchange of CO2 due to the failure of monsoons in the northern Indian Ocean (Duplessy, 1982; Prell, 1984; Sarkar et al., 1990; Krishnamurthy, 1990). These would result in an increased use of dissolved bicarbonate (Hayes, 1993)-enriched in 13C by 9‰ relative to dissolved CO2, thereby enriching the glacial organic matter in 13C and causing an increase in oceanic pH. Using data reported for the northern Indian Ocean, we calculate such pH changes to be in the range of 0.01 to 0.13, consistent with recent estimates based on boron isotope analysis (Sanyal et al., 1995).",,"carbon isotope; marine sediment; organic matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031822539

However, NH3 would not have been a significant component of the neutral or mildly reducing (N2, CO2, H2O) atmosphere which characterized the Hadean earth (&gt; 3.8 Gyr ago), especially in view of the u.v. lability of NH3, the greater u.v. output of the young sun than pertains today, and the absence of an atmospheric u.v. screen. Heterogeneous phase reactions, following atmospheric chemistry, have been proposed as a prebiotic NH3 source. Lightning, or bolides (meteorites and comets), generated NO(x)., and Fe2+ in the sea could have reduced NO2- resulting from the NO(x). to NH4+; this disequilibrium NH4+ level could have supported the production of the nitrogenous organic building blocks of life. NO(x). and NH(y) thus could both have had important roles in the origin and evolution of life. Burgeoning biota could soon have depleted abiotically generated NH4+, and biological N2 fixation could have evolved in its present Fe-demanding, O2-sensitive forms in the Archaean O2-free, Fe2+-rich environment. Organic matter could have driven biological denitrification reactions based on NO2- and NO3- generated abiologically using some redox components which evolved in earlier chemolithotrophs and photolithotrophs, regenerating atmospheric NO(x). and producing N2O. Any atmospheric NH3 leaking from oceanic biology would have been subject to u.v. breakdown and rain-out. Although O2-evolving photosynthesis probably began in the Archean some 3.5 Gyr ago, any O2 accumulation was local until 2.0 Gyr ago (Proterozoic) due to consumption by oxidation of Fe2+ and S2-. However, localized O2 accumulation before 2.0 Gyr ago could account for the observed early evolution of cytochrome oxidase and the possibility of O2-consuming chemolithotrophic and chemoorganotrophic nitrification, with further possibilities of NO(x). production. Oxygen accumulation globally from 2.0 Gyr onwards coincided approximately with the evolution of eukaryotes, which contributed phagotrophy to the reactions of the N cycle as well as the nutrification-like aerobic production of NO. by nitric oxide synthetase, while lightning and bolides could now generate NO. from N2 and O2. Evidence for terrestrial ecosystems is found from 1.0 Gyr onwards; NO(x). and NH2 generated by terrestrial biota stands a greater chance of escaping to the atmosphere than do these compounds generated in the sea where recycling within the water body is likely. As CO2 levels fell and O2 levels rose, NH3 cycling in the photorespiratory carbon oxidation cycle might have been evident as early as 1 Gyr ago, although this does not seem to be a major contributor to atmospheric NH3 today. Embryophyte evolution on land 450 Myr ago, together with symbionts and biophages, increased primary productivity and N cycling on land, with greater quantitative possibilities for NO(x). and NH3 escape to the atmosphere. The evolution of lignin (and related phenylpropanoids) at least 400 Myr ago, with associated NH3 recycling in vascular land plant, does not seem (on present evidence) to increase NH3 loss to the atmosphere significantly. Biomass burning occurred at least 350 Myr ago with lightning as the likely ignition source; such burning yielded NO., NH3, N2O and N2 from organic N. As in earlier times, the existence of terrestrial embryophyte vegetation has been punctuated by major bolide impacts, with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary impact generating perhaps 104 as much NO. as a year's thunderstorms do today, although the toxicity of NO(x). per se to vegetation might not have been the major effect of the NO(x). on biota. Terrestrial plants suffered fewer extinctions at this time than did many other major taxa. Despite such very significant generators of atmospheric combined N as major bolide impacts, the mean levels of NH(y), NO(x). and N2O (and O3) in the atmosphere during the 450 Myr existence of embryophyte vegetation was lower than the current, globally averaged, anthropogenically influenced values. Current globally averaged levels of atmospheric combined N are thus not without precedent in the history of life, globally for NO(x)., and locally for NH(y), so vegetation has had evolutionary experience of high atmospheric combined N. However, this should not make us complacent about the impact of current wide-spread and continuing anthropogenic inputs of combined N, in view of the rate and extent of the inputs, and their combination with other aspects of local anthropogenic influence (e.g. SO2 from burning of high-S coal), stratospheric O3 depletion, and global environmental change (increasing CO2, temperature and sea-level).","Ammonium; Atmosphere; Biogeochemistry; Evolution; Nitric acid; Nitrogen oxides; Palaeoecology","ammonia; evolution; nitrogen metabolism; biogeochemical cycling; global ecology; nitrogen; plant evolution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642646223

Such magmas may get modified by simultaneous wall rock assimilation and fractional crystallization during the liquid immiscibility in a crustal magma chamber. The element and isotope effects of such a process are likely to be reflected in the final products. To treat these effects and to understand the evolution of the immiscible liquids, a model has been developed modifying the assimilation-fractional crystallization (AFC) model of DePaolo (1981). I demonstrate the applicability of this model by an example using Sr isotope systematics of silicate-carbonate melt immiscibility. The initial 87Sr/86Sr ratio and Sr concentration variation in the silicate rocks of some alkaline-carbonatite complexes of Deccan Province are found to be a result of lower crustal contamination (up to 5%) of the parent carbonated silicate magma, while the 87Sr/86Sr of the carbonate melt separated out of the parent remained unaffected. Though the data on silicate rocks could also be explained by the conventional AFC model, the processes treated by the model do not include liquid immiscibility, needed for explaining the evolution of the cogenetic carbonatites. It appears from this study that the slightly higher initial 87Sr/86Sr (than that of the coexisting carbonatites) shown by the alkaline silicate rocks could be due to crustal contamination of the carbonated silicate parent magma during concurrent fractional crystallization of silicates and exsolution of carbonate melt. Though the model has been applied to a very specific case-that of carbonate-silicate melt immiscibility-it can be applied to any case in which both assimilation and immiscibility occur together.",,"fractional crystallization; immiscibility; isotope; magma chemistry; trace element",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032467611

Preliminary calculations of the flow pattern in the vortex finder using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) indicate that it is possible to collect a certain fraction of the escaped particles utilizing the swirl present. The collection of the particles occurs in a so-called 'Post Cyclone' (PoC) in which the diameter of the vortex finder is broadened slightly. The particles in the effluent air from the cyclone enter the PoC region through a narrow slit where they are collected in a bleed stream. Different mechanisms such as impact on walls and agglomeration aid in the collection. Initial experiments performed with a cyclone of dimensions greater than the usual laboratory range (diameter = 0.4 m) indicate a reduction in emission of particles of 1-3 μm by around 30%. Experiments were conducted with different configurations of the PoC and also under different operating conditions in order to characterize the system.

Similar variability has also recently been observed for the interval 340500 thousand years ago. These dramatic climate shifts, expressed most strongly in the North Atlantic region, may be linked to - and possibly amplified by -alterations in the mode of ocean thermohaline circulation. Here we use sediment records of past iceberg discharge and deep- water chemistry to show that such millennial-scale oscillations in climate occurred over one million years ago. This was a time of significantly different climate boundary conditions; not only was the early Pleistocene epoch generally warmer, but global climate variations were governed largely by changes in Earth's orbital obliguity. Our results suggest that such millennial-scale climate instability may be a pervasive and long-term characteristic of Earth's climate, rather than just a feature of the strong glacial-interglacial cycles of the past 800,000 years.",,"ice; climate instability; glacial cycle; palaeoclimate; Pleistocene; article; astronomy; atlantic ocean; boundary layer; climate; geography; history; oscillation; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032537123

Soybean (Glycine max var. Essex) was grown in open-top field chambers in either charcoal-filtered air (CF, 20 nmol mol-1) or non-filtered air supplemented with 1.5 x ambient [O3] (c. 80 nmol mol-1) at ambient (AA, 360 μmol mol-1) or elevated [CO2] (700 μmol mol-1). Sampling period significantly affected all the variables examined. Changes included a decrease in the activity and content of Rubisco during seed maturation, and increased nitrogen (N), leaf mass per unit area (LMA) and total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC, including starch and sucrose) through the reproductive phases. Ontogenetic changes were most rapid in O3-treated plants. At ambient [CO2], O3 decreased initial activity (14-64% per unit leaf area and 14-29% per unit Rubisco) and content of Rubisco (9-53%), and N content per unit leaf area. Ozone decreased LMA by 17-28% of plants in CF-AA at the end of the growing season because of a 24-41% decrease in starch and a 59-80% decrease in sucrose. In general, elevated [CO2], in CF or O3-fumigated air, reduced the initial activity of Rubisco and activation state while having little effect on Rubisco content, N and chlorophyll content, per unit leaf area. Elevated CO2 decreased Rubisco activity by 14-34% per unit leaf area and 15-25% per unit Rubisco content of plants in grown CF-AA, and increased LMA by 27-74% of the leaf mass per unit area in CF-AA because of a 23-148% increase in starch. However, the data suggest that, at elevated [CO2], increases in starch and sucrose are not directly responsible for the deactivation of Rubisco. Also, there was little evidence of an adjustment of Rubisco activity in response to starch and sucrose metabolism. Significant interactions between elevated [CO2] and [O3] on all variables examined generally resulted in alleviation or amelioration of the O3 effects at elevated CO2. These data provide further support to the idea that elevated atmospheric CO2 will reduce or prevent damage from pollutant O3.","Carbohydrate metabolism; Non-structural carbohydrates; O3 x CO2 interaction; Rubisco; Sugars","Glycine max; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031773968

Calcination of [Pd(NH3)4]2+-exchanged mordenite at 350°C in O2 results in decomposition of the amine complex and formation of square-planar Pd2+ oxo species within the mordenite pores. Reduction of these species at 150°C in H2 yields Pd clusters with an average nuclearity of 3. On an average two 2.22 Å Pd-O bonds are associated with each Pd3 cluster; we infer that this interaction serves to anchor the clusters within the pores. After reduction at 150°C, the FTIR spectrum of irreversibly adsorbed CO is indicative of a mixture of Pd+, Pdδ+, and Pd0 carbonyl species. Reduction at 350°C produces larger intrazeolitic Pd clusters (average nuclearity of 6) that exhibit only a weak interaction with the mordenite, as evidenced by their facile aggregation in the presence of CO at 30°C.

The experimental results demonstrate the utility of using multiple or split fuel injections in combination with EGR for giving significant emissions reduction over the entire engine operating range. The mechanisms of emission reduction have been revealed by means of combustion visualization and CFD modeling. Soot is reduced due to the fact that the soot producing regions at the tip of the sprays are not replenished with fresh fuel when each injection is terminated and then restarted. The large reduction in soot possible with multiple injections allows the use of higher levels of EGR than is possible with single injections, so that NOx can be reduced significantly while soot levels are simultaneously kept low.","Diesel engine; EGR; Emissions; Multiple injection; Split fuel injection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0542373721

The case is advanced that freshwater ecologists need to champion the relevance of their work to the development of ecological theory and to the understanding of ecosystem function and behaviour, not least for its importance in addressing pressing applications to the stewardship of the biosphere. An essential step is to review, and update where necessary, the paradigms of aquatic ecology. 2. It is proposed that the major constraint on the organisms, their attributes and adaptations are related first to the physical properties of the medium in which they live. The drives to grow and reproduce relate to the trophic transfer of reduced carbon with important microbial interventions. General principles of 'emergy' apply. The supportive capacities of given environments may be set by chemical constraints, but it is suggested that, with the exception of chronically resource-deficient waters, population dynamics relate to opportunities incumbent upon system variability and the consequent pulsation of resources. 3. Variability affects diversity, through frequent revision of the thermodynamic base. Frequent structural change promotes species diversity and, because function is maintained, it appears that efficient function is dependent upon high diversity. Caution is necessary because high productivity and high diversity are both products of the disturbances consequent upon external forcing and manifestly non-equilibrium conditions. 4.

Soil moisture was adjusted to -0.5 MPa potential, and East Texas crude oil was added to each soil to provide 8% oil on a dry soil weight basis. Incubation temperature was either 10°or 30°C during the 7-day period. Volatile hydrocarbons were analyzed using gas chromatography. At 30°C, soil reduced volatilization by 17%, compared with oil alone, but there was no significant difference between the two soils. Addition of peat or hay reduced oil volatilization further. Activated carbon reduced volatilization losses by 28%. Decreasing the temperature from 30°to 10°C reduced volatilization by approximately 20% for most treatments. Significant amounts of volatile hydrocarbons were lost within the first 4 h after addition of oil to the soil; therefore, it may not be practicable, in many situations, to add bulking agents quickly enough to reduce volatilization significantly.","Bulking agents; Crude oil; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Soil; Sorbents; Volatilization","bermuda grass; bioremediation; gas chromatography; hydrocarbon; petroleum; sawdust; soil; soil degradation; soil pollution; United States; volatilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031945214

It is not an absolute either in terms of psychology nor biology but rather it is a sodai and historical construct. Childhood is also a lived experience related to changes in formalized perceptions of who the young are and who they should or can become according to definitions of appropriate or inappropriate behavior, normal and abnormal development. Class and race influence how a child's age-status is perceived. This paper examines the idea of childhood in the United States as an emergent concept as it was socially constructed afier the Civil War in the mid-nineteenth century up to the present construction of a youth crisis in die 1990s. Three shifts in the meaning of childhood as shaped by the policies and practices of adults are described. First, children of low status came under public supervision. The southern states during Reconstruction after the Civil War ended in 1865 up to the First World War are used as a case study where children are divided by class and race. Second, the child became the subject of scientific investigation in the inter-War period. The influence of the mental hygiene movement in establishing middle class Anglocentric standards as a norm is used as a focus. Third, childhood became a “thing-in-itself’ in the last half of the twentieth century both as an object of hope and despair. The discussion begins with an overview of the climate which fostered social policies directed toward controlling children. © 1998 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064025266

Urban, biomass burn, electrical power plant and paper mill plumes are examples of sources encountered during these flights, and some of their characteristics are described. For example, in the urban plume from Mobile, Alabama, an upper limit to the ozone production efficiency was 6-7 parts per billion by volume (ppbv) of O3 per ppbv of NOx oxidized. Emissions from several biomass fires had lower efficiencies of 2-4 ppbv ppbv-1, but the average rate of production of ozone was as high as 58 ppbv hr-1 for one fire where the plume was isolated from mixing to the surface. Close encounters with paper mill and power plant emissions showed chemical consumption of O3, while far-field encounters with power plant plumes showed enhanced O3 due to photochemical production. Observations made in early morning, below a nocturnal inversion provide indirect evidence of significant nighttime oxidation of freshly emitted NOx to reservoir constituents.

Samples containing differing total percent deuteration, as determined from mass spectral data, were extracted during the reaction. Using a simulation program, the hydrogen-deuterium exchange was deemed to be a statistically random process. The optically detected magnetic resonance spectrum showed multiple traps in these partially deuterated samples. Seven well-resolved peaks were observed in one of the transitions, while in the other, deconvolution of the spectra assuming Gaussian line shapes yielded all seven lines. In 2-indanone, the third transition is not observed. Correlations were made between the seven peaks in the two transitions by electron-electron spin double resonance, and the zero-field splittings of each of the multiple traps were determined. The seven molecular species generated in the deuteration were correlated to specific zero-field transitions by analyzing the ODMR of samples which had a higher concentration of specific partially deuterated molecules. An analysis of these energies indicated that the shift was the result of a change in the D value which was about 8.1 MHz per additional deuterium. The E value changed little, - 2.6 MHz per added deuterium. In addition, the analysis of the integrated intensities indicated that one of the two out-of-plane geometries of the carbonyl group in 2-indanone was favored over the other. Difference in the zero-point energies of the double minimum potential surface was postulated to be the cause. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The plants were exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2 and soil nutrient enrichment in a complete factorial experiment. The response of root-inhabiting non-mycorrhizal and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi to the altered resource base depended strongly on the plant species. Elevated CO2 and fertilization altered the ratio of non-mycorrhizal to mycorrhizal fungal colonization for some plant species, but not for others. Percent root infection by non-mycorrhizal fungi increased by over 500% for Linanthus parviflorus in elevated CO2, but decreased by over 80% for Bromus hordeaceus. By contrast, the mean percent infection by mycorrhizal fungi increased in response to elevated CO2 for all species, but significantly only for Arena barbara and B. hordeaceus. Percent infection by mycorrhizal fungi increased, decreased, or remained unchanged for different plant hosts in response to fertilization. There was evidence of a strong interaction between the two treatments for some plant species and non-mycorrhizal and mycorrhizal fungi.

Sea surface temperatures are increased/decreased in the tropics and polar regions, with little change in the global average surface air temperature. Then the experiments are repeated with colder/warmer conditions globally. Expectations generated from these runs are compared with the resulting climate changes in a doubled CO2 experiment and show overall agreement. Results show that the latitudinal temperature gradient governs the Hadley cell intensity, eddy energy properties, and eddy transports other than latent heat. The global mean temperature governs moisture and cloud cover, Hadley cell extent, and total rainfall. The degree of tropical and subtropical moisture changes depend on both the latitudinal gradient and the mean temperature. The Aleutian low is particularly sensitive to gradient changes, while the Icelandic low (and therefore the Greenland ice core region) is not, possibly due to orographically induced constraints in the North Atlantic. The results are then compared with paleoclimate evidence to deduce what has happened to latitudinal gradients and climate in the past. It is estimated that low-latitude temperature gradients similar to today's may have occurred in the Mesozoic and in the Little Ice Age; reduced gradients were more likely in the Pliocene, Eocene, Younger Dryas, and Last Glacial Maximum. At higher latitudes, warm climates likely had reduced temperature gradients, and cold climates increased gradients. Observed equator to pole gradients were increased in the 1980s relative to the 1950s, and the simulated climate changes consistent with observations include warming of Alaska and Asia, drying in the subtropics, and moisture variability in the US. Assignment of causes to past latitudinal gradient changes is problematic due to uncertainties concerning CO2 and ocean heat transports, but tentative conclusions based on this analysis support the likelihood of a future, higher-CO2 climate exhibiting a large low-latitude gradient and ample precipitation at middle latitudes.",,"carbon dioxide doubling; climate change; GCM; sea surface temperature; temperature; (North); Atlantic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032571207

This work provides a sensitivity analysis linking climate, streamflow, and planning decisions. Water resource planners want reliable time series of streamflow in the basin. Sacramento basin hydrological models do well at simulating monthly streamflow time series from the observed station precipitation and temperature data. However, climate models poorly simulate the large scale processes and features that are ultimately important in determining precipitation and streamflow in the Sacramento Basin region. Observational data for the Sacramento Basin indicates that basin streamflow is sensitive to precipitation changes of the size indicated by GCM 2×CO2/1×CO2 studies. We devised a broad range of plausible scenarios for basin streamflow changes and carried out a qualitative examination of the consequences of planning on any one of the scenarios should any of the different scenarios actually come to pass. For the problem of maintaining basin water deliveries, some of the possible long range planning decisions in the Sacramento Basin depend on choice of climate scenario. This dependance will be influenced by demand changes and normative decision criteria. Thus, basin streamflow is sensitive to uncertainty in the range of GCM simulated basin precipitation, and long range supply planning decisions for the basin are potentially sensitive to the choice of streamflow scenario; contingent upon the range of scenarios assessed and on normative decisions related to risk aversion and the evaluation of impacts. This contingent result runs counter to recent quantitative climate impact studies that have adopted the convenient fiction that current GCM regional climate scenarios provide comprehensive estimates of potential regional changes. The challenge is to find robust planning options that smooth out the sensitivity to a wide variety of different climate realizations.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002823916

Studies have shown that the ongoing coordination of transit schedules, fares and transfer facilities can improve system connectivity and reliability, making transit a more attractive alternative to the automobile. Furthermore, they have shown that better use of transit and non-motorized transportation can effectively reduce automobile emissions and improve regional mobility. In turn, improved mobility can facilitate increased access to key employment, housing, shopping and recreational opportunities. This paper tracks past efforts to integrate transit services in the case cities through a literature search. Regardless of the regulatory environment, transit planners agree that one way to improve efficiency and reduce travel times is for a regional authority to promote integration as part of a comprehensive urban mobility plan. Ideally, this arrangement will yield improvements in the quality and affordability of alternative travel modes, intraurban mobility and access to transit centers.",,"International cooperation; Scheduling; Transportation; Transportation charges; Urban planning; Regional mobility; Transit integration; Regional planning",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031676979

Carbon enters the peatlands in groundwater, precipitation, and primary productivity. Carbon leaves the peatlands by groundwater and surface water outflow and by the outgassing of methane. Results of the simulations of the carbon budget show that the peatland is now probably a sink for carbon, supported by field data showing peat is, in fact, accumulating at the rate of about 1 mm yr-1 [Glaser et al., 1997]. Excluding extreme values, Monte Carlo simulation results indicate that the Rapid River Peatland stores between -28.98 g C m-2 yr-1 (release) and 50.38 g C m-2 yr-1 (storage) with a mean accumulation of 12.74 g C m-2 yr-1 over the 1,506,200 m2 watershed.

Two PEPC isoforms with respective native molecular masses of 400 (PEPC1) and 650 (PEPC2) kDa have been purified from Chlamydomonas reinhardtii CW-15 cc1883 (Chlorophyceae). SDS/PAGE, immunoblot and CNBr peptide-mapping analyses indicate the presence of the same 100 kDa PEPC catalytic subunit in both isoforms. PEPC1 is a homotetramer, whereas PEPC2 seems to be a complex between the PEPC catalytic subunit and other immunologically unrelated polypeptides of 50-70 kDa. Kinetic analyses indicate that these PEPC isoforms are (1) differentially regulated by pH, (2) activated by glutamine and dihydroxyacetone phosphate and (3) inhibited by glutamate, aspartate, 2-oxoglutarate and malate. These results are consistent with the current model for the regulation of anaplerotic carbon fixation in green algae, and demonstrate that green algal PEPCs are uniquely regulated by glutamine. Several techniques were used to assess the structural relationships between C. reinhardtii PEPC and the higher plant or prokaryotic enzyme. Immunoblot studies using anti-(green algal or higher plant PEPC) IgGs suggested that green algal (C. reinhardtii, Selenastrum minutum), higher plant (maize, banana fruit, tobacco) and prokaryotic (Synechococcus leopoliensis, Escherichia coli) PEPCs have little or no immunological relatedness. Moreover, the N-terminal amino acid sequence of the C. reinhardtii PEPC subunit did not have significant similarity to the highly conserved corresponding region in enzymes from higher plants, and CNBr cleavage patterns of green algal PEPCs were distinct from those of higher plant and cyanobacterial PEPCs. These results point to significant evolutionary divergence between green algal, higher plant and prokaryotic PEPCs.",,"2 oxoglutaric acid; aspartic acid; cyanogen bromide; dihydroxyacetone phosphate; enzyme antibody; glutamine; isoenzyme; malic acid; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; amino acid sequence; amino terminal sequence; article; chlamydomonas reinhardtii; enzyme activation; enzyme analysis; enzyme inhibition; enzyme kinetics; enzyme purification; enzyme regulation; enzyme structure; enzyme subunit; higher plant; immunoblotting; molecular weight; nonhuman; peptide mapping; ph; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; prokaryote; sequence homology; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Immunoblotting; Isoenzymes; Kinetics; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Weight; Phosphoenolpyruvate Carboxylase; Sequence Alignment; Species Specificity; Substrate Specificity; algae; Chlamydomonas reinhardtii; Chlorophyceae; Chlorophyta; Cyanobacteria; Embryophyta; Escherichia coli; Eukaryota; Nicotiana tabacum; Prokaryota; Rickettsiales; Selenastrum minutum; Synechococcus leopoliensis; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032055053

As part of this program, the United Technologies Research Center has assembled e seven member team to identify and develop the technology fora High Performance Power Systems (HIPPS) that will provide in the near term, 47% efficiency (HHV), and meet emission goals only one-tenth of current New Source Performance Standards for coal-fired power plants. In addition, the team is identifying advanced technologies that could result in HUTS with efficimcies approaching 55% (HHV). The HIPPS is a combined cycle that uses a coal-fired High Temperature Advanced Furnace (HITAF) to preheat compressor discharge air in both convective and radiant heaters. The heated air is then sent to the gas tuibine where additional fuel, either natural gas or distillate, is burned to raise the temperature to the levels of modem gas turbines. Steam is raised in the HITAF and in a Heat Recovery Steam Generator for the steam bottoming cycle. With state-of-the-art frame type gas turbines, the efficiency goal of 47% is met in a system with more than two-thirds of the heat input furnished by coal. By using advanced aeroderivative engine technology, HIPPS in combined-cycle and Humid Air Turbine (HAT) cycle configurations could result in efficiencies of over 50% and could approach 55%. The following paper contains descriptions of the HIPPS concept including the HITAF and heat exchangers, and of the various gas turbine configurations. Projections of HIPPS performance, emissions including significant reduction in greenhouse gases are given. Application of HIPPS to repowering is discussed.

A state-of-the-practice regional travel demand model is used to simulate the travel effects of the APTS technologies in the Sacramento region for the year 2015. A method of obtaining consumer welfare is applied to the mode choice models in the travel model. It was found that APTS technologies, which were simulated in this study to act as feeder service for light rail and bus transit, did not significantly reduce congestion and emissions in the region. This was primarily because the Sacramento region lacks extensive penetration by light rail and bus service. The consumer welfare evaluation, however, showed that all the APTS technology scenarios yielded an economic benefit and were generally equitable even when capital, operation, and maintenance costs were included in the analysis. Further, the analysis showed that advanced transit information service alone produced the greatest increase in consumer welfare. The total yearly difference in benefits among the scenarios would be significant. Thus, it is concluded that the method of obtaining consumer welfare used in this study is a useful analytical tool for identifying optimal bundles of APTS technologies.",,"advanced public transport system; emissions control; transport economics; travel demand; California; Sacramento; USA; Computer simulation; Advanced public transportation systems (APTS); Travel demand modeling; Intelligent vehicle highway systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031597043

These occurrences are associated with two primary large-scale circulation patterns. Most commonly, the midlatitude westerlies are split across North America, with downstream confluence of the northwesterly polar and the southwesterly subtropical jet streams. A second, less frequent, pattern features an amplified westerly jet across North America, with a correspondingly rapid progression of weakly developed cyclones through the region. In the case of the split flow pattern, composite surface high pressure is established, occasionally disrupted by the emergence from either stream of relatively weak cyclones. These systems act to moisten the affected region at low levels through horizontal transport of moisture and, to a lesser extent, moisture convergence. Subsidence inversions established following the passage of these systems act to slowly erode the depth of the surface-based moist layer but are insufficient in combination with the weak solar radiative input to dissipate the cloud. The properties of the event structure, from the large scale down to that of the cloud layer itself, are stable. Under such conditions, the mechanism that finally removes the cloud is the passage of a relatively well-developed baroclinic wave and its associated forcing (subsidence, dry air advection, moisture divergence). Correspondingly, the difficult act of forecasting the end of such periods requires an accurate assessment of the sufficiency of that forcing to remove the low-level cloud. It is suggested that a relatively simple one-dimensional boundary layer model employed for the time to be critically tested in conjunction with the standard forecast model guidance (forecast vertical motion, profiles of temperature and moisture, Model Output Statistics cloud cover and ceiling) would provide additional information regarding forecast uncertainty.",,"Boundary layers; Climatology; Flow patterns; Mathematical models; Statistics; Storms; Persistent low overcast event; Weather forecasting; atmospheric circulation; cloud cover; weather forecasting; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032172939

The PEACE study has shown that in the winter of 1993-1994, large gradients in particles with a 50% cut-off aerodynamic diameter of 10 μm (PM10) levels across Europe existed from north to south. The difference in PM10 level between urban and control locations was in most study areas quite small. Overall, no clear association between changes in peak expiratory flow and changes in air pollution or between changes in incidence or prevalence of respiratory symptoms and changes in air pollution could be detected. Possible explanations of this lack of effect are discussed. In some of the locations, air pollution levels may have been too low to result in demonstrable, acute effects on respiratory health. Children with nightly coughing as their only screening symptom may not react to air pollution, reducing the association for the whole panel to insignificance. Respiratory infections could have obscured or even reversed the association between air pollution and respiratory health indicators.

Eggs of specimens from the greater area of the city of São Luis in the State of Maranhão, Brazil, yielded approximately 300 nymphs. These nymphs were placed in labelled Barrel glasses, in which they were weekly fed on rats (Rattus norvegicus), until reaching the stage to be observed. The experiments were conducted in a climatic chamber regulated at 29 ± 1°C, 70% relative humidity and 12 hr photoperiod. The resistance to starvation increased according to the stage of development, except for adult bugs, whose results were similar to the 3rd stage nymphs. In all these development stages there was an abrupt loss of weight in the first week, followed by a gradual loss until death. Comparing this work with those of other authors, it was observed that T. rubrofasciata is among the less resistant triatomine species.","Resistance to starvation; Triatoma rubrofasciata","Hemiptera; Rattus norvegicus; Reduviidae; Triatoma rubrofasciata; Triatominae; animal; article; growth, development and aging; life cycle; parasite vector; physiology; rat; starvation; time; Triatoma; weight reduction; Animals; Arthropod Vectors; Life Cycle Stages; Rats; Starvation; Time Factors; Triatoma; Weight Loss",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032109205

While its estimates of long-term average yields are accurate for most purposes, additional model development is desirable to fully reflect year-to-year variability. We tested the precision of EPIC (version 5300) in estimating mean yields and in replicating yearly yield variability as influenced by the potential evapotranspiration (PET) method, using field data from a 27-yr crop rotation experiment at Swift Current, Saskatchewan. Rotations tested ranged from continuous wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) to fallow-wheat-wheat. Mean estimated yields were compared with measured yields (MY) and detrended yields (DY). Estimated yields and MYs were further compared by regression, ratio of variances due to lack-of-fit and to experimental errors (R), and model efficiency (EF). Mean yields estimated using the Penman-Monteith and the Priestly-Taylor PET methods resulted in significant underestimations, associated with high annual PET values, and were not analysed further. The Hargreaves (H) and Baler-Robertson (BR) PET methods resulted in mean yields not different than MY or DY for most cases, especially the BR method. EPIC with the H method accounted for 18 to 66% of the variability in annual yield estimation, whereas the BR method accounted for 29 to 60%. These were slightly, but not significantly, lower than results obtained with regionally derived statistical crop models. Overall EPIC with the BR PET method provided yield estimates accurate and precise enough for long term studies. The relatively high R and low EF values obtained, though, suggest further improvements in EPIC are necessary to better replicate yearly yield variability. Analysis of yield residuals indicated that EPIC may not be simulating accurately enough the water balance and its effects throughout the off-season and in the early part of the growing season.","Crop model; Potential evapotranspiration; Semiarid temperate climate","Apus apus; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031773833

Previous tests of the model have determined that it is suitable for long-term yield estimation, but it is less precise in assessing annual yield variability. To determine the reasons for the discrepancies between estimated and measured yields, we tested the ability of EPIC version 5300 to predict soil water and soil nitrogen dynamics, using data from a long-term spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) rotation experiment in the semiarid prairie region of Canada. Potential evapotranspiration (PET) estimates varied among methods tested: Priestley-Taylor and Penman-Monteith methods resulted in PET means that were about twice those obtained with the Hargreaves and Baler-Robertson methods. The higher PET means were associated with an excessive estimation of net radiation. We used the Baler-Robertson method to generate the other estimates reported herein. EPIC generally overestimated total soil water, but it still allowed clear differentiation among rotation phases and times of the year, and provided adequate estimates of water during the critical shot-blade stage. Water estimates by soil layer were also generally overpredicted, especially at depths from 0.15 to 0.60 m, but we were able to differentiate among rotation phases and times of the year. Precision of these latter estimates was generally low, accounting at most for 27% of the variability, and varied by soil layer, rotation phase and time of the year. Nitrate-N estimates tended to be lower than measured values, especially at depths below 0.3 m and during vegetative growth phases. However, the estimates also allowed us to distinguish among the rotation phases and times of the year. Total N and organic C were satisfactorily estimated by EPIC. In general, EPIC provided adequate long-term estimates of the environmental quality indicators tested.","Environmental modelling; Environmental quality; Fallow; Potential evapotranspiration methods; Spring wheat; Sustainability","carbon; model; nitrogen; semiarid region; soil water; temperate environment; Canada; Triticum aestivum; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031773535

In view of the potential costs and risks involved, it is vital that the effectiveness of these policies be monitored and managed. As part of Eskom's environmental research programme, extensive air quality monitoring has been undertaken on a regional basis since the late 1970s, in order to assist management in assessing environmental impacts and to facilitate appropriate control strategies. Due to the strategic location of the monitoring sites, trends in air pollution related to domestic and industrial expansion, emission control strategies and electrification programmes may be identified. This paper provides data from Eskom's monitoring network situated in the Gauteng, Free State and Mpumalanga regions of South Africa, presents trends, and identifies the sources where possible. Recorded concentrations for 1994 are compared with the Department of Environmental Affairs and Tourism (DEAT) guidelines. In general, concentrations fell well below the DEAT guideline values, the exception being fine particulate matter at the site Bedworth Park in the Vaal Triangle, where the daily mean guideline was exceeded on 10 occasions.

The ecosystem responses were assessed by comparing the whole-system net gas exchange (NEE) upon changing CO2 levels from 900 to 450 ppmV. The day-NEE was significantly higher in the elevated CO2 treatment. In both experiments, the NEE rates were similar to values observed in natural analogue systems. Variations in night-NEE, reflecting both soil CO2 efflux and plants respiration, covaried with temperature but showed no clear correlation with atmospheric CO2 levels. After correcting for changes in CO2 efflux we show that the rain forest net photosynthesis increased in response to increasing atmospheric CO2. The photosynthetic enhancement was expressed in higher quantum yields, maximum assimilation rates and radiation use efficiency. The results suggest that photosynthesis in large tropical trees is CO2 sensitive, at least following short exposures of days to weeks. Taken at face value, the data suggest that as a result of anthropogenic emissions of CO2, tropical rain forests may shift out of steady state, and become a carbon sink at least for short periods. However, a better understanding of the unique conditions and phenomena in Biosphere 2 is necessary before these results are broadly useful.",,"Biosphere 2; carbon budget; carbon dioxide enrichment; mesocosm; rainforest; USA, Arizona, Oracle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031824741

This was evidenced by the increase in V(max) for [3H]MTX (methotrexate) influx and a commensurate increase in the amount of the 46 kilodalton (kDa) transport protein and reduced folate carrier (RFC-1) mRNA. The variant is resistant to lipophilic antifolates, but shows collateral sensitivity to classical folate analogues. Karyotype analysis of L1210/R83 cells revealed the presence of several new chromosome abnormalities. One of these was a large, submetacentric marker chromosome comprising a normal 10 and a longer, abnormally banded arm of uncertain origin which exhibited an interstitial, palely staining, HSR-like segment. The results of Southern and Northern blotting showed that the RFC-1 gene copy number and RNA transcript level were markedly increased (30-35 fold) in L1210/R83 cells. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that the HSR-like segment in these cells was the site of amplified RFC-1 genes. Independent revertant subclones, obtained following growth in the absence of selection pressure, showed four- to 12-fold decreases in [3H]MTX influx V(max) and in amount of NHS [N-hydroxysuccinimide)-[3H]MTX affinity labeled one-carbon, reduced folate transporter compared to L1210/R83 cells. RFC-1 gene copy number also decreased, and the mean length of the HSR in these revertants declined 1.6- to 5-fold.

The model has also been used for calculating the energy consumption for a standard farm set-up, one weather location and the average actual glasshouse climate to determine the separate effects. The results pointed out that the individual farm set-up and the individual glasshouse climate had the main impact on the differences in energy consumption between farms (30 and 16%, respectively). A relatively constant ratio was found between the simulated energy consumption in the individual situation and the simulated energy consumption in a standard situation (standard farm set-up and average weather). This ratio can be used for eliminating the effects of individual farm set-up and local weather on energy consumption. A ratio figure is calculated with which the actual energy consumption can be adjusted.

(Hymenophyllaceae) is unique in possessing both extensive sexual (sporophyte and gametophyte generations present) and asexual (gametophyte only) ranges. It was first discovered in central Europe in 1993 and is represented in this area only by its perennial, vegetatively propagating gametophyte generation. Genetic variation has been investigated at 35 sites. Allozyme diversity is partitioned primarily between, not within, sites. Although genetic variation exists at a fine scale (< 5 m) within some populations, the results suggest that clones were not intimately associated in these cases. The majority of sites support unique multilocus phenotypes. Where phenotypes were present at more than one site they tended to recur at the next closest site. However, similar phenotypes link eastern and western Pfälzerwald sites up to c. 70km apart. This pattern of diversity suggests that colonisation was not solely of a ""stepping stone"" or ""leading edge"" type. We suggest that during a climatically favourable period, probably the Atlantic hypsithermal, there may have been an explosive colonisation by long-distance dispersal from refugial areas. This was followed by a short period during which sporophyte production, sexual reproduction and local spread were possible. With climatic change, reduction in the available habitat and the loss of the sporophyte generation, different individual genets became fixed within small, favourable, but scattered, sites. The possibility that some central European sites north of the Alps acted as periglacial refugia cannot be discounted, but would appear less likely than (re-)colonisation from the Atlantic fringe.","Allozymes; Clonal organism; Independent gametophytes; Postglacial migration; Tertiary relict","population structure; climate effect; colonization; population structure; sexual behavior; Trichomanes speciosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032443406

Enzyme samples were titrated under equilibrium conditions using various partial pressures of CO in Ar and CO2 atmospheres. EPR signal intensities from each cluster were analyzed as a function of potential using the Nernst equation. The presence of CO2 raised the reduction potentials of the A-, B- , and C-clusters, and it appeared to increase the strength of CO (substrate for acetyl-CoA synthesis) binding to the reduced A-cluster. Carbon dioxide also appeared to stabilize an intermediate EPR-silent state of the C-cluster and alter the saturation/relaxation properties of the reduced B-cluster.

Box 10940, Pittsburgh, PA 15236, United States","The conversion of municipal solid waste (MSW) to energy can conserve more valuable fuels and improve the environment by lessening the amount of waste that must be landfilled and by conserving energy and natural resources. The importance of utilizing MSW was recognized in the 1991 U.S. National Energy Strategy, which sought to ""support the conversion of municipal solid waste to energy."" One route to utilizing the energy value of MSW is to burn it in a steam power plant to generate electricity. Coal has long been the predominant source of energy for electricity production in the U.S.; therefore, a considerable science and technology base related to coal combustion and emissions control can be, and has been, applied with substantial benefit to MSW combustion. This paper compares the combustion of coal and MSW in terms of fuel characteristics, combustion technology, emissions, and ash utilization/disposal. Co-combustion of coal and MSW is also discussed. MSW issues that can be addressed by research and development are provided. The major environmental issues that designers of MSW combustion systems have had to address are emissions of trace organic compounds, particularly polychlorinated dioxins and furans, and trace elements such as mercury, lead, and cadmium. Emission of trace organics is generally the result of a poorly designed and/or operated combustion system; modern MSW systems use good combustion practices that destroy organic compounds during the combustion process. Proper control of air/fuel mixing and temperature, and avoidance of ""quench"" zones in the furnace, help to ensure that potentially harmful organics are not emitted. Computer codes and other design and troubleshooting tools that were developed for coal combustion systems have been applied to improve the performance of waste-to-energy systems. Trace element emissions from both coal and MSW combustion result primarily from vaporization of elements during the combustion process. Most of the trace elements that are vaporized condense on fly ash as the combustion products cool downstream of the furnace and can be effectively controlled by using an efficient particulate removal device. However, volatile elements, particularly mercury, are emitted as a vapor. Several mechanisms are available to capture mercury vapor and some are in use. The development of satisfactory control technology for mercury is a topic currently of high interest in coal burning. The potential for leaching of trace elements and organics from MSW residues after disposal raises issues about the classification and management of ash. Results of laboratory leaching tests, especially for lead and cadmium, have not been consistently supported by field experience. Careful interpretation of the available test protocols is needed to make sure that residues are properly managed. Because of the large scale of coal-fired boilers for electricity production, co-firing of MSW with coal in such boilers could consume large quantities of waste. Several short-term demonstrations have shown that co-firing is feasible. The issues involved in co-firing are emissions of trace elements, trace organics, and acid gases; boiler slagging and fouling; and long-term effects, such as corrosion and erosion of boiler tubes. Areas where research and development has contributed to improved MSW combustion include (a) the formation mechanisms of polychlorinated dioxins/furans, especially low-temperature, catalytic mechanisms, (b) methods of combustion air distribution in incinerators that result in better combustion and reduced emission of organic compounds, (c) the use of gas reburning to control NOx and reduce emission of organic compounds, (d) practical methods for removing organic compounds and mercury from MSW flue gas, (e) the performance of electrostatic precipitators in removing MSW fly ash, particularly when co-firing MSW and coal in existing coal-fired boilers, and (f) burning MSW in fluidized beds or of pulverizing refuse-derived fuel and firing it in suspension-fired, pulverized coal boilers. © 1998 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.","Coal combustion; Emissions; Incineration; Municipal solid waste; U.S. DOE programs","Air pollution control; Coal; Coal ash; Fly ash; Particulate emissions; Refuse disposal; Solid wastes; Waste incineration; Waste utilization; Emission control; Municipal solid waste; Coal combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032317759

W38) and transgenic tobaccos with antisense DNAs directed against the Rubisco small subunit (anti-SSu plants) or the chloroplast glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (anti-GAPDH plants). High ribulosebisphosphate (RuBP) pools were generated in leaves by exposing them briefly to very low CO2, after which they were transferred to varying CO2 concentrations, and transient CO2 assimilation rates were measured within the first 2-3 s. Comparison of the transient (RuBP-saturated) and steady-state rates confirmed that the CO2 assimilation rate in anti-SSu plants was RuBP-saturated (i.e. Rubisco limited) at all intercellular CO2 partial pressures (C1), and that, in anti-GAPDH plants, the transition from RuBP-saturation to RuBP-limitation occurred at lower assimilation rates and lower C, as GAPDH activity was decreased. In addition, we investigated whether the integrated post-illumination CO2 uptake could be used as a non-destructive means of estimating RuBP pools in leaves. In wild-type plants there was generally a good agreement between RuBP pools extracted from leaves after rapid freeze-clamping and estimates made from post-illumination CO2 uptake. However, in the anti-SSu plants, the post-illumination CO2 uptake underestimated the actual RuBP content and the discrepancy became larger as the Rubisco content decreased.

An aircraft study provided data from which power plant emissions removal rates and measurement-based estimates of OPE are estimated. This study was performed as part of the Southern Oxidants Study-1995 Nashville intensive and focuses on the evolution of NOx, SO2, and ozone concentrations in power plant plumes during transport. Two approaches are examined. A mass balance approach accounts for mixing effects within the boundary layer and is used to calculate effective boundary layer removal rates for NOx and SO2 and to estimate net OPE. Net OPE is more directly comparable to photochemical model results than previous measurement-based estimates. Derived net production efficiencies from mass balance range from 1 to 3 molecules of ozone produced per molecule of NOx emitted. A concentration ratio approach provides an estimate of removal rates of primary emissions relative to a tracer species. This approach can be combined with emissions ratio information to provide upper limit estimates of OPE that range from 2 to 7. Both approaches illustrate the dependence of ozone production on NOx source strength in these large point source plumes. The dependence of total ozone production, ozone production efficiency, and the rate of ozone production on NOx source strength is examined. These results are interpreted in light of potential ozone control strategies for the region.

Several measures have been proposed to control styrene exposure, but only a few of them are capable of keeping the styrene concentration below 20 ppm. The present study was carried out to evaluate current ventilation systems in reinforced plastic plants and to develop new, effective ventilation systems for controlling styrene exposure. The roles of styrene-suppressed resin and styrene emission during different phases of the moulding process were also studied. Styrene exposure and the performance of current ventilation systems were measured in 17 reinforced plastics plants. Better styrene control was sought experimentally by investigating the effects of unidirectional airflow on a worker's exposure, by testing local exhaust and local air supply ventilation methods in controlling laminator's exposure and by examining the possibilities to improve local ventilation using an automatically moving ventilation unit. The characteristics of styrene emission during hand lay-up and the effect of a rolled area on styrene evaporation were also determined. Dilution ventilation systems are common in Finnish reinforced plastics plants. In many cases, the ventilation system was incorrectly dimensioned and workers were exposed to high styrene concentrations. High dilution airflow rates, over 850 m3 kg-1, may be needed before a concentration level below 20 ppm is achieved with the resin consumption rates common today. In order to meet the present exposure limit, local ventilation techniques should be used in combination with other control measures. Well-designed zonal ventilation methods (e.g., a horizontal airflow tunnel) produced a favourable airflow pattern for controlling styrene vapours in the lamination area. However, work practices must be synchronized with the airflow pattern before low styrene exposure levels are reached. A worker standing in a unidirectional airflow facing downstream may also receive significant exposure due to contaminant transporting eddies formed downstream of the body. It is possible to control this type of exposure with a local air supply unit located over the worker. Styrene control during hand lay-up moulding is also possible with the use of several local exhaust hoods. It was estimated that adequate styrene control can be achieved when the control velocity at the edge of the mould is 0.15-0.2 m s-1 and the exhaust airflow rate per laminate area is between 0.1 and 0.2 m3 s-1 m-2, depending on the shape of the mould. An automatically moving local ventilation unit, equipped with local exhaust and a local air supply, was able to keep the styrene concentration near or below 20 ppm when medium-size products were laminated with the hand lay-up method. A styrene concentration of below 20 ppm was also obtained when a new type of spray booth, equipped with automatically moving curtains, was used and when the control velocity was at least 0.3 m s-1 during the spray-up of gelcoat resin. The use of vapour-suppressed resin reduced the total styrene emission by 30-60%, but the reduction was much lower during active lamination. After rolling, the emission from the vapour-suppressed resin was found to be very low, and, therefore, the emission rate was dependent on the size of the surface area rolled simultaneously. The use of these resins is beneficial, especially when large products are laminated.","Air quality; Indoor air; Local ventilation; Occupational health; Occupational safety; Plastics industry; Styrene; Ventilation (air conditioning)",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347649452

This data will be extremely valuable to geochemists and modelers interested in the global carbon cycle. Nevertheless, it will still be necessary to interpolate measurements both temporally and spatially to incorporate the results into global circulation models. This paper presents a new method that attempts to quantify the processes known to influence surface ocean CO2 fugacity. The method is tested using data collected along a Pacific WOCE section (P17E) across the Southern Ocean. These calculations offer more insight into the factors controlling f(CO2) than published analysis/interpolation schemes in that individual effects are quantified without resorting to empirical relationships. The procedure works extremely well for spatial interpolation along section P17E and sheds insight into physical processes (mixing and air-sea gas exchange) where model results differ from observations. If the method proves to be robust when applied to other areas, it will be a significant step toward interpolation of sparse ocean CO2 measurements in order to calculate either regional or global CO2 fluxes.","Anthropogenic; Carbon dioxide; p(CO2); Pacific; Southern Ocean","carbon dioxide; fugacity; sea surface; surface water; (South); Pacific",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031899541

The contemporary occurrences in relation to present-day climate and to predicted changes in climate (and hence annual accumulated respiration equivalents) are used to predict possible future immigrations and extinctions within each grid square. The percentage of potential change in species richness for each grid square is estimated from these predictions. Results from this study suggest a mean increase in species richness per grid square of 26%. Increases in species richness are greatest in the southern parts of the alpine/boreal regions in Fennoscandia.

Several other 2,3,7, 8-substituted PCDD and PCDF and non-ortho substituted PCB also bind to the Ah receptor and induce toxic responses similar to those for TCDD. Moreover, for these HAH there is a rank order correlation between their structure-Ah receptor binding and structure-toxicity relationships, and this supports a role for the Ah receptor in mediating these responses. Thus, the toxic equivalency factor (TEF) approach for HAH is based on the common mechanism of action for TCDD and related compounds in which a TEF value for a ""dioxin-like"" congener is defined as the potency of the individual (i) congener relative to TCDD ([EC50 [TCDD]/EC50 [test compound]). The toxic or dioxin equivalent (TEQ) for a mixture of HAH is defined by the following equation: TEQ = ∑ [PCDDi] · TEFi + ∑ [PCDFi] · TEFi. Industrial emissions and environmental and food residues contain complex mixtures of HAH (exodioxins) and the TEF/TEQ approach is used to regulate emissions and estimate the potential exposure and possible adverse health effects of exodioxins. The TEF approach for risk assessment of exodioxins makes a number of assumptions, including response additivity for individual compounds in a mixture of HAH. This review documents some of the following problems and limitations of the TEF approach: 1) environmental and food residues of HAH contain ""non-dioxin-like"" PCB that exhibit ""antidioxin"" activity for some responses; 2) the human diet contains endogenous Ah receptor ligands (endodioxins) such as polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), aromatic amines in cooked foods, indole3-carbinol (I3C), and related hetero-PAH in cruciferous vegetables. Mass balance and mass potency estimates for human dietary intakes suggest that for some responses the effects of natural or endodioxins may be greater than those of exodioxins; and 3) I3C, a weak Ah receptor agonist, also exhibits Ah receptor antagonist activity, and interactions between I3C and endodioxins may inhibit or inactivate some toxic responses and decrease TEQExodioxin.","Dioxins; Halogenated Hydrocarbons; Risk Assessment","aromatic hydrocarbon; benzofuran derivative; dioxin; polychlorinated biphenyl; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; polymer; animal; animal disease; biological model; diet; eating; food contamination; government; human; pollution; reproducibility; review; risk assessment; United States; Animals; Benzofurans; Diet; Dioxins; Eating; Environmental Pollution; Food Contamination; Humans; Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Models, Biological; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polymers; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031606297

The transcription of IME1 is repressed in the presence of glucose, and a low basal level of IME1 RNA is observed in vegetative cultures with acetate as the sole carbon source. Upon nitrogen depletion a transient induction in the transcription of IME1 is observed in MATa/MATα diploids but not in MAT-insufficient strains. In this study we demonstrate that the transcription of IME1 is controlled by an extremely unusual large 5' region, over 2,100 bp long. This area is divided into four different upstream controlling sequences (UCS). UCS2 promotes the transcription of IME1 in the presence of a nonfermentable carbon source. UCS2 is flanked by three negative regions: UCS1, which exhibits URS activity in the presence of nitrogen, and UCS3 and UCS4, which repress the activity of UCS2 in MAT-insufficient cells. UCS2 consists of alternate positive and negative elements: three distinct constitutive URS elements that prevent the function of any upstream activating sequence (UAS)under all growth conditions, a constitutive UAS element that promotes expression under all growth conditions, a UAS element that is active only in vegetative media, and two discrete elements that function as UASs in the presence of acetate. Sequence analysis of IME1 revealed the presence of two almost identical 30- to 32-bp repeats. Surprisingly, one repeat, IREd, exhibits constitutive URS activity, whereas the other repeat, IREu, serves as a carbon-source-regulated UAS elements. The RAS-cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase cAPK pathway prevents the UAS activity of IREu in the presence of glucose as the sole carbon source, while the transcriptional activators Msn2p and Msn4p promote the UAS activity of this repeat in the presence of acetate. We suggest that the use of multiple negative and positive elements is essential to restrict transcription to the appropriate conditions and that the combinatorial effect of the entire region leads to the regulated transcription of IME1.",,"transcription factor; transcription factor ime1; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; controlled study; gene activation; gene control; gene deletion; gene repression; meiosis; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein analysis; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; sequence analysis; transcription initiation; transcription regulation; Animalia; Fungi; Myxogastria; Saccharomyces cerevisiae; Saccharomyces cerevisiae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031948847

It is mentioned in the literature that there is either a cooling tendency or cessation of warming after the late 1950s at most of the Indian industrial cities. A case study of Nagpur, a centrally located city in India, is done to understand and the possible cause of cooling. Nagpur is the only city in India for which a long-term record of temperature, for urban (Mayo Hospital) and relatively suburban (Sonegaon Airport) area, is available.

On the local level the problem is associated with matters such as noise and air pollution, while on the global level the problems are associated with acid rain, ozone layer depletion and the greenhouse effect (global warming). The transport sector is a major contributor in this respect. The use of appropriate decision-making tools to assist in the assessment of alternative transport policies is required urgently. One such tool is the TEMIS program which was described in Part 1 of this investigation, where the methodology for the enhancement of TEMIS was reported. The enhanced version of TEMIS has subsequently been used to model the effects of different transport scenarios in order to improve future fuel economy and the adverse effects of air emissions as well as the greenhouse gases. In the present paper, three main case studies have been considered to test the effect of different scenarios (in terms of alternative fuels and technical advances) on energy consumption and emissions: firstly, the switch to alternative fuels, through investigating the effects of switching from petrol to diesel, secondly, the effects of switching from diesel to bio-diesel (for buses) and, finally, the effects of technical advances (three-way catalytic converters) and the effects on fuel consumption and emissions are considered. © IMechE 1998.","Emissions; Fuel consumption; Transport policies","Air pollution; Computer simulation; Exhaust gases; Fuel economy; TEMIS code; Transport policies; Vehicle emissions; Fuel consumption; emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032412379

This model divides the cylinder charge into two zones, namely the unburnt zone (surrounding air) and the burnt zone (fuel spray with entrained air). The burnt zone is subdivided into 16 concentric sprays, instead of only eight sprays as in previous work, each one with its own temperature and composition. Liquid fuel, fuel vapour, air and products of combustion are assumed to be present in each zone. Real gas relations are used to calculate the properties of the mixture while products of combustion are assumed to be in chemical equilibrium at local temperature. The extended Zeldovich mechanism is used to predict the NOx formation. The cylinder pressure, temperature, heat release rate, NOx rate and concentration are calculated. For different injection pressures, injection advance angles and different fuel orifice hole diameters, the results show that the model can predict the measured cylinder pressure with high accuracy but it predicts the measured heat release rate and NOx emission rate with moderate accuracy. In addition, the effect of injection parameters on the NOx emission and engine power is predicted and it has been shown that NOx emission can be reduced without noticeable loss of engine power. This can be done by appropriate choice of injection pressure, injection advance angle and fuel nozzle hole diameters. © IMechE 1998.","Burning quality; Combustion; Diesel engine; Injection parameters; Multizone model; NOx emission","Combustion; Exhaust gases; Fuel injection; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Nozzles; Pressure; Temperature; Direct injection diesel engines; Injection pressures; Multizone models; Diesel engines; diesel engine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032429210

As a partial inhibition of active CO2 transport by glycolaldehyde under steady-state C(i) flux conditions has been recently suggested, in this paper, using mass spectrometry, we investigate in detail the relationship between glycolaldehyde concentration ([GLY]) and CO2 transport both during the initial period following illumination of a cyanobacterial cell suspension and during the so-called steady state when an internal C(i) pool has been allowed to develop. Carbon dioxide uptake following illumination of a cyanobacterial cell suspension was progressively reduced by increasing [GLY] in the medium, both in the absence or in the presence of carbonic anhydrase. The same features were found when either C(i) in the form of bicarbonate was injected to a pre-illuminated cell suspension in the presence of carbonic anhydrase in the medium or a pulse of CO2 was provided to the cells in the light without carbonic anhydrase in the extracellular medium. Although photosynthesis was completely abolished with 10 mM glycolaldehyde, CO2 uptake was only inhibited 20% but was decreased further by higher [GLY]. Double reciprocal plots of CO2 uptake versus initial [CO2] determined with a range of [GLY] showed the inhibition to be noncompetitive. To simultaneously study CO2 uptake and CO2 efflux, H13C18O3 was used with cells in which CO2 transport alone, or both CO2 and HCO3- transport system were allowed to proceed. Cells were inhibited with either iodoacetamide or glycolaldehyde and the time course of the various CO2 species in the medium demonstrated that CO2 uptake was inhibited partially with glycolaldehyde resulting in a greater CO2 efflux from the cells. When the cell suspension was again illuminated, in the presence of glycolaldehyde, initial CO2 uptake was greatly reduced, and the extracellular [CO2] eventually rose to a level higher than that which would be expected to be in equilibrium with the amount of C(i) present in the medium. Results are discussed in terms of glycolaldehyde use in C(i) transport mechanism studies in cyanobacteria.","Blue-green algae; C(i) concentrating mechanism; CO2 efflux; COL transport; Cyanobacteria; HCO3- transport; Inhibitor; Synechococcus UTEX 625","bacterial metabolism; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide fixation; carbonate dehydratase; cell suspension; culture medium; glycoaldehyde; illumination; inorganic carbon; iodoacetamide; mass spectrometry; photosynthesis; statistical analysis; transport kinetics; algae; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chlorophyta; Cyanobacteria; Synechococcus; Synechococcus; Synechococcus sp.

After complete recrystallization, however, a steady increase in γ and almost no changes in α were observed with increasing strain.

While λi, was determined by the deformation texture and the thicknesses of the deformed grains/bands and naturally decreased with increasing strain, estimations of parameter (2) were obtained from the so-called nucleation factors (Ni, defined as the number of recrystallized i grains per i band - as measured/estimated along the ND).

This article provides a perspective on the epidemiologic evidence on particulate air pollution and health. It addresses the evolution of methods for investigating air pollution and mortality and morbidity and the interpretational framework for the findings of the studies. Our work at the Johns Hopkins University School of Hygiene and Public Health, fimded by the Health Effects Institute as part of its Particle Epidemiology Evaluation Project, provides the foundation, data are from public-use resources and are analyzed using Poisson regression. Data from previous analyses were replicated, and a detailed analysis for Philadelphia 1974-1988 was conducted to explore the sensitivity of the findings to key modeling assumptions. Our findings show that the association of total suspended particles with mortality persisted, an effect of ozone was also noted that remained unchanged as other pollutants were considered. Varying measures of air pollution are associated with mortality in diverse communities and have been robust to choices of analytic methods. Similar analyses with single locations will contribute little to our understanding of air pollution and mortality unless there are special pollution patterns. Nonetheless, the weight of evidence from single locations indicates an adverse effect of air pollution.

Our first objective was to measure the CO2 regime during summer in a wide range of small alkaline Danish streams subject to wide variation in temperature, O2 and CO2 during the day. The second objective was to determine the effect of these variations on daily changes in light-saturated photosynthesis in water of a homophyllous and a heterophyllous amphibious species that only used CO2, and an obligately submerged species capable of using both HCO3/- and CO2. We found that the median CO2 concentrations of the streams were 11 and 6 times above air saturation in the morning and the afternoon, respectively, but stream sites with dense plant growth had CO2 concentrations approaching air saturation in the afternoon. In contrast, outlets from lakes had low CO2 concentrations close to, or below, air saturation. The amphibious species showed a reduction of photosynthesis in water from morning to afternoon along with the decline in CO2 concentrations, while increasing temperature and O2 had little effect on photosynthesis. Photosynthesis of the obligately submerged species varied little with the change of CO2 because of HCO3/--use, and variations were mostly due to changes in O2 concentration. Independent measurements showed that changes in temperature, O2 and CO2 could account for the daily variability of photosynthesis of all three species in water. The results imply that CO2 supersaturation in small lowland streams is important for the rich representation of amphibious species and their contribution to system photosynthesis.","Aquatic plants; CO2; Photosynthesis Streams","aquatic plant; carbon dioxide; photosynthesis; stream; submerged vegetation; Denmark",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032420859

Yet, little is known about intraspecific variation in this trait. Among three populations in the northern range of E. farinosa, which span a very broad precipitation gradient, both leaf absorptance variation and differences in the timing of drought-induced leaf loss were broadly associated with climatic variability. Where mean annual rainfall was greatest, drought-induced leaf loss was earliest, but these plants also had higher population-level mean leaf absorptance values. Higher absorptance increases the relative dependence on latent heat transfer (transpirational cooling), but it also provides greater instantaneous carbon assimilation. Plants at the driest site reached lower leaf absorptance values and maintained leaves longer into the drought period. Lower leaf absorptance reduces water consumption, and extended leaf longevity may buffer against the unpredictability of growing conditions experienced in the driest site. These observations are consistent with a trade-off scenario in which plants from wetter regions might trade off water conservation for higher instantaneous carbon gain, whereas plants from drier regions reduce water consumption and extend leaf longevity to maintain photosynthetic activity in the face of unpredictable growing conditions.","Desert plant adaptation; Drought response; Leaf longevity; Leaf pubescence and absorptance; Water use trade-offs","adapation; brittlebush; desert shrub; leaf loss; phenotypic variation; pubescence; rainfall; Asteraceae; Encelia farinosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031890040

A pressure chamber was used to determine the needle water potential (MPa). Climatic parameters were measured in the forest for the computation of the potential transpiration (T(p)) by means of the Penman-Montheith equation. During the rainy period, the transpiration (T) rate was maintained at a level between 1 and 2 mm day-1, which then dropped after the last rain; the decrease of T in small trees (diameter at breast height [DBH] &lt; 12 cm) was much faster than that in larger trees (DBH &gt; 12 cm).

One category of heavy-duty vehicles, urban transit buses, constitutes a highly visible source of pollutant emissions and must meet even more stringent standards. In response, engine manufacturers have produced diesel engines that produce virtually no black smoke and emit several times less particulate matter (PM) than older engines. The tighter PM emissions standards that apply to urban transit buses only were found to be cost-effective ($4,600 to $6,300 per Mg of PM reduced) compared with other control strategies. The Urban Bus Retrofit/Rebuild Program was found to be somewhat less cost-effective ($6,900 to $42,000 per Mg). Both of these programs could be extended to other heavy-duty vehicles. However, the use of compressed natural gas (CNG) in transit buses was found to have a costeffectiveness of $0.9 million to $1.8 million per Mg of PM. Replacing older diesel engines with low-emission diesels is the most cost-effective way to reduce transit bus emissions. By purchasing more clean diesels instead of fewer cleaner CNG buses, transit agencies can produce greater reductions in fleetwide emissions. In fact, the transit agency in this study with the most alternative-fuel buses has the highest fleetwide PM emissions rate. It is premature to expand the alternative-fuel transit bus fleet beyond the experimental level. Regulatory policy should be reassessed as the understanding of the link between diesel emissions and health effects improves.",,"Air quality; Buses; Carbon monoxide; Hydrocarbons; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Public policy; Regulatory compliance; Vehicles; Compressed natural gas; Heavy duty vehicles; Particulate emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032157904

This enzyme displays a high catalytic efficiency for a common AKR substrate 9,10-phenanthrenequinone (9,10-PQ). Surprisingly, Y55F and Y55S mutants of 3α-HSD reduced 9,10-PQ with high k(cat) values. This is the first report whereby the invariant catalytic tyrosine of an AKR has been mutated with retention of k(cat) values similar to wild-type enzyme. The Y55F and Y55S mutants displayed narrow substrate specificity and reduced select aromatic quinones and α-dicarbonyls. k(cat) versus pH profiles for steroid oxidoreduction catalyzed by wild-type 3α-HSD exhibited a single ionizable group with a pK = 7.0-7.5, which has been assigned to Tyr 55. This group was not evident in the k(cat) versus pH profiles for 9,10-PQ reduction catalyzed by either wild-type or the Tyr 55 mutant enzymes, indicating that the protonation state of Tyr 55 is unimportant for 9,10-PQ turnover. Instead, wild-type and the active-site mutants Y55F, Y55S, H117A, D50N, K84R, and K84M showed the presence of a new titratable group with a pK(b) = 8.3-9.9. Thus, the group being titrated is not part of the tetrad. All the mutants decreased k(cat)/K(m) considerably more than they decreased k(cat). Thus, the K84R mutant demonstrated a 30- fold decrease in the pH-independent value of k(cat) but 2200-fold decrease in the pH-independent value of k(cat)/K(m). This suggests that all the tetrad residues influence quinone binding and that Lys 84 plays a dominant role in maintaining proper substrate orientation. Using-wild-type enzyme, the energy of activation (E(a)) for 9,10-PQ reduction was ~11 kcal/mol less than steroid oxidoreduction. The E(a) for 9,10-PQ reduction was unchanged in the Tyr 55 mutants, suggesting that the reaction proceeds through the same low- energy barrier in the wild-type enzyme and these mutants. The retention of quinone reductase activity in this AKR in the absence of Tyr 55 with k(cat) versus pH rate profiles and activation energies identical to wild- type enzyme suggests that quinone reduction occurs via a mechanism that differs from 3-ketosteroid reduction. In this mechanism, the electron donor (NADPH) and acceptor (o-quinone) are bound in close proximity, which permits hydride transfer without formal protonation of the acceptor carbonyl by Tyr 55. This represents a rare example where one enzyme can catalyze the same chemical reaction (carbonyl reduction) by either acid catalysis or by a propinquity effect and where these two mechanisms can be discriminated by site-directed mutagenesis.",,"oxidoreductase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) dehydrogenase (quinone); reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; amino acid substitution; article; catalysis; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; enzyme substrate complex; priority journal; reaction analysis; structure activity relation; 3-Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Animals; Catalysis; Energy Transfer; Enzyme Activation; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutagens; NAD(P)H Dehydrogenase (Quinone); NADP; Oxidation-Reduction; Phenanthrenes; Rats; Substrate Specificity; Tyrosine; Felis catus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032483038

The city of Mendoza is located in a semi-arid region at the eastern edge of the Cordilleres. In Mendoza the high concentration of ozone precursors and the strong solar radiation may contribute to high levels of summersmog. Series of continuous ambient tropospheric ozone, temperature and wind measurements were taken for a period of one year starting in November 1995 and analyzed in terms of diurnal and annual variation. Indications were found of the strong impact of the mountain-valley circulation system, which ventilates and considerably cleans the air in Mendoza. The low level jet is mainly active during the summer. It lowers the peak mid-day ozone concentration and produces a temporary concentration increase at night. The WHO standard of 0.113 mg ozone/m3 (56.5 ppb) is only rarely exceeded during winter. Thanks to the existing natural ventilation, ozone pollution is not expected to have any critical adverse health effects. Nevertheless, the elevated ozone concentrations during calm periods in winter highlight the necessity of reducing precursors from vehicle emissions.

U.S. policy circles are enamored with cost/benefit analysis via integrated assessment models, but even within that conventional analytic paradigm, uncertainties in climate effects, climate change damages and abatement policy costs have been formally treated by statistical distributions. Results suggest some ten percent subjective probability that climatic change would prove economically beneficial, a comparable likelihood of catastrophe climate surprises, and the 'best guess' being a small cost to the economy from carbon policies like a modest carbon tax, tradable permit system or low carbon technology development subsidies. More problematic in the U.S. is a polarized media debate which pits 'good for you' versus 'catastrophic' advocates in continuous - and confusing - contention. This confusion, coupled with an elliptical fossil fuel industry media campaign, organized labor union fears of lost jobs, and conservative ideological opposition to most anything 'governmental' has rendered climate policy making in the U.S. problematic, despite the many opinion polls in the U.S. suggesting the public is overwhelmingly in favor of some emissions restraints and the passions of the Vice President to satisfy that large constituency.

The kinematics of photoionized electrons in the intense laser fields (10 18- 10 19 W cm -2) and the Coulomb-driven expansion of the electron distribution photoionized from the atomic cluster both indicate that the strong pump-laser wavelength scaling in the production of kilovolt x-rays from Xe clusters results from the more localized and controlled electron-cluster interactions afforded by a shorter optical period.",,"Approximation theory; Electron energy levels; Infrared radiation; Kinematics; Laser pulses; Photoionization; Pumping (laser); Ultrafast phenomena; Ultraviolet radiation; X rays; Born approximation; Electron-atom collisions; Xenon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345817319

For example, sediment records of organic carbon, opal and biogenic barium have been used to reconstruct past variations in production in different oceanic regimes, but these tracers cannot be used to discriminate between the relative contributions of different phytoplankton groups. Such a discrimination would provide greater insight into the operation of the biological 'pump' transporting material down out of surface waters, and into the possible influence of the structure of oceanic food chains on carbon fluxes. Several organic biomarker compounds have now been established for tracing the contribution of different planktonic groups to organic carbon in sediments. Here we show that four such biomarkers - dinosterol, alkenones, brassicasterol and chlorins, which represent dinoflagellates, prymnesiophytes, diatoms and chlorophyll-producers, respectively - have concordant concentration maxima that coincide with organic carbon maxima over the past 200,000 years in a sediment core from the northeastern Arabian Sea. Not only do these organic tracers track changes in ocean production in this region, but the similar distributions of dinosterol and brassicasterol indicate that the relative contributions of the dominant members of the phytoplankton community (diatoms and dinoflagellates) to production were roughly uniform on time-scales greater than 3,000-4,000 years over the past 200,000 years.",,"brassicasterol; dinosterol; oxygen; surface water; unclassified drug; bioindicator; carbon cycle; community structure; organic carbon; paleoceanography; phytoplankton; article; asia; geographic distribution; global climate; phytoplankton; pressure gradient; priority journal; sediment; spectroscopy; taxonomy; Arabian Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032490994

The mixture formation process is influenced considerably by the spray-wall interaction. Stringent exhaust gas emission regulations and growing demands for fuel economy are leading to the application of high-pressure fuel injection systems, e.g. common-rail. The trend towards downsized engines with smaller piston displacements leads to reduced distances between nozzle and wall. Higher injection pressures and smaller nozzle-wall distances both increase the significance of spray-wall interaction and near-wall mixture formation. In the present study the influence of governing parameters like injection pressure and wall temperature on the characteristics of the impinged spray was investigated. The measurements have been performed in an optical accessible high-pressure high-temperature combustion chamber, in which air pressures and air temperatures up to 5 MPa and 500 °C can be realised under steady state conditions. A flat wall with adjustable wall temperature was placed at a distance of 20 mm from the nozzle hole. A passenger car common-rail injector with a mini-sac-hole-nozzle was applied to the combustion chamber. The spray axis of the investigated nozzle hole was oriented perpendicular to the wall. Commercially available diesel fuel was used. Locally resolved simultaneous measurements of droplet velocity (axial and radial velocity component) and droplet diameter at several positions 2 mm above the wall inside the impinged and deflected spray were performed with phase Doppler velocimetry (PDV).

The use of conductive plastics eliminates the need for the priming step, and improves paint transfer efficiency and first pass yield. The conductivity is provided via graphite nanotubes. Graphite nanotube technology provides advantages over other technologies such as conductive carbon black. In order to reach the percolation threshold for conductivity in carbon black containing resins, the loading of carbon black required tends to embrittle the resin. Fibrils are more effective at establishing percolation at lower loadings, so a significant loss in toughness is avoided.

A further year's survey of six sites has been collected for 1994/95 and amendments/revisions to the databases have been completed (1998). This is relatively straight-forward and non-controversial. The challenge for the project is to distribute the survey findings to the various agencies and local authorities to help shape management policies, strategies and development plans. Important progress has already been made with several training days on accessing the information, as well as presentations across Wales with the Countryside Council for Wales. The Steering Group, comprising the regional bodies implementing and shaping policy, have a key role in this process. Its first priority has been to try to link new grant aid structures through the Countryside Council for Wales, with defined targets requiring partners to follow the approved methodology outlined in this paper. This co-ordinated and strategic approach provides the basis for the continuation of extensive market research to feed into the policy-making process (Fig. 3). The fundamental problem to overcome, however, is the establishment of new mechanisms to enable survey information to be fed directly into the statutory planning process. The improved status of countryside strategies as a statutory requirement and planning tool is seen as necessary to secure viable and long term funding for strategic recreation surveying and to break down the barriers caused by entrenched agency insularity and perceived competition. Furthermore, the Countryside Council for Wales has an important role to play in guiding their partners to consider a more regional dimension in their policy-making processes. The members of the South Wales Steering Group have recognized the benefits of co-operation within this project. Many other agencies and individuals have contributed to the data collection aspects of the project but it will take time to bring in new organizations such as the National Trust, Wildlife Trusts and the new unitary authorities. This becomes all the more important in the current climate of ad hoc strategy formation, particularly as evidenced by recent local government reorganization in 1996. The strategy response again represents a further missed opportunity. Short term political and financial interests have still prevailed in the new authorities, and strategies have been hastily produced and localized without reference to the wider regional pattern, data and public involvement. Empirical data were not used even though they now exist. This has a negative effect on the development plan process which, increasingly, has to address issues of amenity, recreational needs and provision as primary matters for consideration (Department of the Environment, 1991). The combined use of databases and survey evidence from this project and its translation to other regions of Wales (Mid and North) will help the management and planning for such purposes. The production of a South Wales regional strategy is still in its formative stages but the principal point made in this article is that a strategic approach is now being adopted by the South Wales region of the Countryside Council for Wales to address the nature of recreation provision and demand. The challenges of establishing collaboration and improved communication to achieve joint agreements on aims, objectives and resultant policies, particularly in the new local authorities, could be a protracted and difficult process. There is evidence of a spirit of co-operation and purpose among the Steering Group guiding this project, which suggests that the institutional barriers may not be insurmountable.",,"recreational policy; regional planning; rural planning; strategic approach; (South); United Kingdom; Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032456002

By decomposition of the spectra, the Stark splitting scheme is established for 7F6, 7F5, and 5D4 multiplets of Tb3+ ions in TbAlO3 together with the peak energies in the Fourier transform infrared spectrum at liquid-nitrogen temperature. The multiplets are split into their maximum number of levels, which shows that the point symmetry is low for the Tb3+ ion site in TbAlO3, An induced emission cross section is estimated using the results of decomposition at liquid-nitrogen temperature to be 3.55X 10-19 cm2. This value is comparable to the cross sections reported for Nd:Y3Al5O12, which is a well known solid-state laser material. The population inversion threshold is also estimated for TbAlO3 in comparison with Nd:Y3Al5O12. It is found that the threshold value for TbAlO3 is only about three times larger than that for Nd:Y3Al5O12. This TbAlO3 may have the potential to be a laser material with a visible wavelength at least at low temperature. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001764431

In this new combustion system, a lean burn system using early injection was employed to reduce NOx emission and an auto-ignition DI engine system was employed to achieve the low energy consumption. Methanol was used as the fuel for reducing NOx emission. The objective of this study is to clarify the possibility of the system for the auto-ignition of a premixed lean mixture of methanol fuel. This study shows that the gas temperature at ignition, Tig, is the predominant factor affecting auto-ignition. Auto-ignition occurs when Tig exceeds approximately 1000K. The methanol lean burn system in an auto-ignition DI engine drastically decreased NOx emission with almost the same brake specific energy consumption as a diesel engine in the middle load region. In particular, a NOx emission of 2 g/kWh or less was achieved at the brake specific energy consumption in the range from 10.5 MJ/kWh to 11MJ/kWh in the middle load region.

Concerning the thermal utilization of wood/waste wood the gasification is advantageous compared to the combustion, because of the possibility to generate electric current in a gasmotor or a gasturbine. To optimize the utilization of the caloric value under economical and technical aspects decentral concepts and fixed bed gasifiers should be applied.

Unfortunately none of the existing gasification concepts can guarantee a safe and efficient, much less a continuous operation.

The calculated results agreed with the experimental results very well.

Allelopathy is one mechanism involved in plant competition. Experiments were conducted in a controlled-environment chamber to determine if the concentration of atmospheric CO2 altered the dose- response relationship between an allelopathic phenolic acid and tomato seedling biomass. Seeds of Lycopersicon lycopersicum were planted in quartz sand in styrofoam cups and allowed to germinate and grow for 15-17 days. During the next 14 days, seedlings were watered twice daily with nutrient solution amended with p-coumaric acid (4-hydroxycinnamic acid, HOC6H4CH = CHCO2H; ranging 0-0.85 mg mL-1; 5 concentrations in each experiment) and exposed 24 hr day-1 in continuous-stirred tank reactors (CSTRs) to ambient air (335-375 ppm CO2) or ambient air to which 350 ppm CO2 was added (i.e., approximately twice-ambient CO2; two CSTRs per CO2 concentration in each experiment). Dose-response data relating p-coumaric acid concentration and shoot, root, and total biomass were fit to a flexible decay function. In all three experiments, twice-ambient CO2 significantly increased the y-intercept for the dose-response model for the p-coumaric acid effect on shoot biomass by 25-50% but had negligible effects on other aspects of the models. Results suggest that if CO2 affects plant competition, mechanisms involving allelopathic phenolic acids may not be involved.","Community ecology; Global change; Interference","Allelopathy; Continuous-stirred tank reactors (CSTR); Coumaric acid; Phenolic acid; Atmospheric composition; Biomass; Bioreactors; Carbon dioxide; Carboxylic acids; Composition effects; Ecosystems; Phenols; Plants (botany); Seed; Air pollution; carbon dioxide; para coumaric acid; phenolic acid; unclassified drug; allelochemical; carbon dioxide enrichment; growth; plant; ambient air; article; biomass; controlled study; nonhuman; plant growth; plant seed; tomato; Lycopersicon esculentum; Spermatophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032145076

Many aldehydes, in particular, are cytotoxic. They may react with primary amine groups to form Schiff bases, which may subsequently rearrange into more chemically stable structures. In biological systems, such reactions may disrupt normal oligonucleotide structure, may interfere with the biological activity of numerous structural or enzymatic polypeptides, and may covalently cross-link proteins' and lipids (eg, phosphatidylethanolamine). Once thought to be largely epiphenomenal, such events are now known to be central to the etiologies of a spectrum of neurodegenerative diseases, chronic inflammatory diseases, and pathophysiologically related disorders. Opportunities exist for therapeutic intervention in these disease states by use of certain water-soluble, small- molecular-weight drugs that contain primary amine groups. Such pharmaceutical agents, administered orally, can form Schiff-base derivatives with toxic carbonyl substances and thus protect cellular components. Future studies of such carbonyl-trapping agents may include their use in combination with other classes of drugs, such as antioxidants, anti-inflammatory products, or neuroactive agents. This conceptually simple approach may offer new opportunities for improved clinical management of many chronic disease states.","Aging; Aldehydes; Alzheimer's disease; Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; Arthritis; Carbonyl trapping; Cross- linking reagents; Diabetes mellitus; Lipid peroxidation; Muscular dystrophy; Oxidative stress; Parkinson's disease; Reactive oxygen species","aldehyde; aldose reductase inhibitor; amine; aminoguanidine; antioxidant; beta1 interferon; carbonyl trapping agent; chitin; chitosan; cholinesterase inhibitor; donepezil; epalrestat; glatiramer; imirestat; intercellular adhesion molecule 1; interferon beta serine; interleukin 1; ketone; levodopa; monoclonal antibody; nitric oxide synthase; ponalrestat; reactive oxygen metabolite; Schiff base; sorbinil; superoxide dismutase; tacrine; tolrestat; troglitazone; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; zenarestat; zopolrestat; aging; Alzheimer disease; amyotrophic lateral sclerosis; arthritis; chemical structure; chronic disease; cross linking; degenerative disease; diabetes mellitus; drug activity; inflammatory disease; lipid peroxidation; muscular dystrophy; oxidative stress; Parkinson disease; priority journal; reaction analysis; review",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031657299

Two centuries later, Lind and Bass in a classical study which was carried out under hot/dry climatic conditions (49°C and 20% rh) demonstrated that the adaptation to heat may be described as the series of physiological adjustments that occur when a person who is accustomed of living in a cool environment is transferred to a hot climate. This adaptation is a process which is fully achieved after 10 to 14 days of exposure to heat, but two thirds or even 75% of the adaptation is obtained already within 5 days (1).

The CUSP (Convective Upwind and Split Pressure) scheme is used to provide necessary artificial dissipation without contaminating the solution. This explicit method yields excellent parallel speedups, thus enabling the calculation of reactive flows with detailed chemical kinetics including large numbers of species and reactions. Results indicate good multigrid speedups and adequate resolution of the reaction zone in inviscid and viscous two-dimensional hydrogen/air and methane/air test cases.","Fluid dynamics; Numerical simulation; Reacting flows","Air; Algorithms; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Hydrogen; Mathematical models; Methane; Reaction kinetics; Supersonic flow; Viscous flow; Explicit multigrid algorithm; Inviscid flow; Hydrocarbons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032308729

PG-P synthase activity is regulated by factors affecting mitochondrial development and through cross- pathway control by inositol. The molecular mechanism of this regulation was examined by using a reporter gene under control of the PGS1 gene promoter (P(PGS1)-lacZ). Gene expression subject to carbon source regulation was monitored both at steady-state level and during the switch between different carbon sources. Cells grown in a non-fermentable carbon source had β- galactosidase levels 3-fold higher than those grown in glucose. A shift from glucose to lactate rapidly raised the level of gene expression, whereas a shift back to glucose had the opposite effect. In either a pgs1 null mutant or a rho mutant grown in glucose, P(PGS1)-lacZ expression was 30-50% of the level in wild type cells. Addition of inositol to the growth medium resulted in a 2-3-fold reduction in gene expression in wild type cells. In ino2 and ino4 mutants, gene expression was greatly reduced and was not subject to inositol regulation consistent with inositol repression being dependent on the INO2 and INO4 regulatory genes. P(PGS1-lacZ expression was elevated in a cds1 null mutant in the presence or absence of inositol, indicating that the capacity to synthesize CDP-diacylglycerol affects gene expression.

The synthesis involves the adsorption of metal carbonyl species or metal ion exchange into zeolite cages followed by reductive carbonylation under a mixed CO and H2 atmosphere. The characterization of the structure and properties of these samples was based on a multianalytical approach, including FT-IR, UV-vis, EXAFS spectroscopies, CO/H2 gas chemisorption, and 13CO isotopic exchange. Methane homologation was carried out on the zeolitic ruthenium clusters using a two-step process. The research encompassed several key points as follows. (i) [Ru3(CO)12] guests in Na56Y zeolite were thermally activated in a hydrogen atmosphere, generating intrazeolitic [H4Ru4(CO)12]. (ii) Hexammineruthenium(III) complexes in Na56X zeolite were thermally activated progressively in a mixed CO and H2 atmosphere. The generation process was considered to occur through conversion of the intermediate [Ru(NH3)5(CO)]2+ and RuI(CO)3 to [Ru6(CO)18]2-. (iii) Internal and external confinements of ruthenium carbonyl clusters were compared. (iv) A rapid 13CO/12CO isotopic exchange was found to reversibly occur for [Ru6(CO)18]2-/Na56X under H2 coexistence. (v) Oxidation fragmentation under an O2 atmosphere and reductive regeneration under a mixed CO and H2 atmosphere were found to reversibly occur for the intrazeolite anchoring of [Ru6(CO)18]2-. (vi) Comparison of the orbitally degenerate ground state for free Ru carbonyl clusters versus the intrazeolitic anchoring site provides a theoretical indication of the symmetry distortion. (vii) Surface carbonaceous fragments were generated by CH4 dissociation on the activated ruthenium clusters based on the analysis of TPD, FT-IR, and mass spectroscopies. These fragments are the precursors for hydrocarbon formation. (viii) The catalytic properties of the intrazeolitic ruthenium clusters showed cluster size dependence.

(1) In contrast to the ΔpsbU mutant which is capable of autotrophic growth in the absence of Ca2+ or Cl- at a reduced rate, the ΔpsbV mutant lacking cytochrome c-550 could not grow at all without Ca2+ or Cl-. (2) The ΔpsbV mutant had a significantly reduced thermoluminescence emission intensity and flash oxygen yield, whereas the ΔpsbU mutant showed slight decreases in thermoluminescence intensity and flash oxygen yield, indicating corresponding decreases in the concentrations of O2-evolving centers in these mutants. (3) The ΔpsbV and ΔpsbU mutants exhibited elevated peak temperature for the thermoluminescence B- and Q-bands indicative of more stable S2 states. (4) The rise time of the O2 signal during the S3-[S4]-S0 transition was increased slightly in the ΔpsbV mutant but not in the ΔpsbU mutant.

Greenhouse gases warm the Earth's surface but cool the stratosphere radiatively and therefore affect ozone depletion. Here we investigate the interplay between projected future emissions of greenhouse gases and levels of ozone-depleting halogen species using a global climate model that incorporates simplified ozone-depletion chemistry. Temperature and wind changes induced by the increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations alter planetary-wave propagation in our model, reducing the frequency of sudden stratospheric warmings in the Northern Hemisphere. This results in a more stable Arctic polar vortex, with significantly colder temperatures in the lower stratosphere and concomitantly increased ozone depletion. Increased concentrations of greenhouse gases might therefore be at least partly responsible for the very large Arctic ozone losses observed in recent winters. Arctic losses reach a maximum in the decade 2010 to 2019 in our model, roughly a decade after the maximum in stratospheric chlorine abundance. The mean losses are about the same as those over the Antarctic during the early 1990s, with geographically localized losses of up to two- thirds of the Arctic ozone column in the worst years. The severity and the duration of the Antarctic ozone hole are also predicted to increase because of greenhouse-gas-induced stratospheric cooling over the coming decades.",,"climate change; greenhouse gas; ozone; polar region; stratosphere; antarctica; arctic; article; environmental impact assessment; greenhouse effect; ozone layer; priority journal; season; stratosphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032499232

During the startup phase, which is the focus of this paper, the ammonia concentration of the leachate was artificially and incrementally increased from about 200 mg N/L ('base') to 1200 mg N/L ('target') to simulate higher strength wastes. The initial attempt to reach the target ammonia concentration resulted in the accumulation of ammonia in both systems, with eventual nitrification failure. The second attempt was successful, with the only difference in procedures being the rate at which an external carbon source (methanol) was added to support anoxic denitrification. Preliminary data obtained from both systems, during the startup phase, indicated that the addition of external carbon to the anoxic reactor could significantly affect system performance during initial startup and operation. Firstly, the simultaneous increase in carbon loading with ammonia loading, to enable high rates of anoxic denitrification, was found to result in greater heterotrophic assimilation of ammonia in the anoxic reactor (i.e. 30% vs 10%) compared to the case when carbon loadings were not increased to match NOx production. The higher rate of anoxic ammonia assimilation, during the second attempt, was sufficient to supplement nitrification ammonia removal and prevent the accumulation of ammonia within the systems. Secondly, during the first attempt, it was found that increasing anoxic carbon loadings, after ammonia had accumulated in the systems, with the intent of increasing denitrification and assimilating excess ammonia, ultimately resulted in complete failure of nitrification. The increased denitrification returned additional alkalinity to the systems and resulted in reactor pH levels increasing by about 1 pH unit. The increase in pH raised the 'free' ammonia fraction, of 'total' ammonia, by almost an order of magnitude. It is believed that increases in aerobic 'free' ammonia levels, resulting from the existing 'total' ammonia levels and the increased pH, caused the nitrification failure.The total nitrogen removal capabilities of two pre-denitrification systems treating methanogenic municipal landfill leachate were studied. During the startup phase, which is the focus of this paper, the ammonia concentration of the leachate was artificially and incrementally increased from about 200 mg N/L ('base') to 1200 mg N/L ('target') to simulate higher strength wastes. The initial attempt to reach the target ammonia concentration resulted in the accumulation of ammonia in both systems, with eventual nitrification failure. The second attempt was successful, with the only difference in procedures being the rate at which an external carbon source (methanol) was added to support anoxic denitrification. Preliminary data obtained from both systems, during the startup phase, indicated that the addition of external carbon to the anoxic reactor could significantly affect system performance during initial startup and operation.","Ammonia; Carbon; Denitrification; Free ammonia; Leachate; Nitrification","Alkalinity; Ammonia; Bioreactors; Carbon; Denitrification; Nitrification; Nitrogen removal; pH; Ammonia leachate; Anoxic denitrification; Biological denitrification; Biological nitrification; Free ammonia; Methanogenesis; Leachate treatment; ammonia; carbon; methanol; nitrogen; alkalinity; article; denitrification; landfill; leaching; nitrification; pH; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032146024

The two-photon spectra for all of these complexes have circular/linear polarization ratios of absorptivity (Ω-values) that show that excitation is to the 1Lb state. Analysis of the Franck-Condon (FC) patterns of the dispersed fluorescence for these indole-polar solvent complexes show that emission is also from the 1Lb state in each case. In the emission spectra, the intensity ratios of the origin and ν26 lines are about 2:1, which is the value expected for 1Lb emission. The ν26 vibration is the most intense nonorigin vibronic line, as expected for 1Lb emission. Finally, there is little or no intensity from the ν8, ν9, and ν10 vibrations, which would be strongly active with emission from the 1La state. These results show unequivocally that for these indole-polar solvent complexes the 1La state does not shift in energy below the 1Lb state - contrary to the interpretation of several recent papers. Further support is given to the assignment of 1Lb emission by spectral simulations. The jet-cooled complexes do not exhibit excited state complex (exciplex) characteristics, wherein the solvent is much more strongly bound in the excited state than in the ground state. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001466344

A 7″ × 13″ portion of the nebula was mapped at a resolution of 6000 in the ν = 1-0 S(1) emission line of molecular hydrogen, revealing the morphology and kinematics of the H2 emission. These spectra show large velocity shifts in the H2 line across the nebula. Comparison with single-dish CO observations show significant velocity differences between the peaks of H2 emission and CO emission. Such differences are unexpected for a photodissociation region (PDR), since PDRs are supposed to form in the surface of the cold gas (as is the case for NGC 7027). A single long-slit spectrum which includes the peak of the H2 emission and covers the entire K band at a resolution of 1000 is analyzed. Fourteen molecular hydrogen emission lines are detected in a 2″ × 0″.5 region covering the bright northeastern H2 lobe. The line ratios indicate that the H2 emission is radiatively excited, but that the gas density is large enough (no 104.5-105 cm-3) for collisions to thermalize the lowest vibrational states. The measured ratio of ortho-hydrogen to para-hydrogen is 2.51 ± 0.22, slightly smaller than the equilibrium value of 3. Spatial variations of the ν = 2-1 vibrational temperature and the ν = 1 ortho/para ratio are consistent with a decrease in the relative proportion of collisional excitation as distance from the central star increases. © 1998.

Different size classes of each species were sampled to evaluate life cycle changes in foliar N and phenolic chemistry and their corresponding influence on insect herbivory. Oak trees had consistently higher foliar N and hydrolyzable tannin concentrations, and they experienced greater herbivore damage than did red maple trees; maple trees had higher condensed tannin levels. Foliar chemistry and herbivore damage were usually quite similar for all size classes. However, condensed tannins, and occasionally total phenolics, were higher in well-insolated mature trees than in shaded understory conspecifics, fitting the pattern expected through plant carbon/nutrient balance relationships. Rainfall fluctuations during 1992-1994 significantly influenced plant-herbivore processes. Foliar N and phenolic concentrations were reduced in all species during the much drier summer of 1993, relative to 1992. The summer drought in 1993 was apparently severe enough to restrict carbon allocation to plant phenolics. In contrast, foliar N levels in oaks were somewhat elevated by the end of the wet 1994 growing season. Total phenol and hydrolyzable tannin levels remained quite low in 1994, when carbon may have been preferentially allocated to growth rather than differentiation, as N uptake increased during the wet summer following drought. Nevertheless, carbon allocation to condensed tannins was quite high for all species during the wet summer. Insect herbivore damage was directly correlated with rainfall totals over the 3-yr period. Herbivore damage on oaks was reduced during the 1993 drought, principally because of less impact by leaf skeletonizers. Insect feeding on oaks and maples was elevated during the wet 1994 summer, when strip feeding by lepidoptera larvae was at its highest. Our findings suggest that herbivore damage at Walker Branch appears to be largely dependent on the response of specific insect feeding guilds to moisture-related changes in foliar N and plant phenolics.","Feeding guilds; Foliar chemistry; Forests; Herbivory; Insects; Maples; Nitrogen; Oaks; Phenolics; Plant defenses; Rainfall; Tannins","forest; nitrogen; phytochemistry; plant-herbivore interaction; rainfall; Tennessee; United States; Walker Branch Watershed; Acer; Acer rubrum; Acer rubrum; Animalia; Hexapoda; Insecta; Lepidoptera; Quercus; Quercus alba; Quercus alba; Quercus alba; Quercus montana; Quercus prinus; Quercus prinus; Quercus prinus; Sapindaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031823047

This review concentrates on plant-bacteria interactions that increase the degradation of hazardous organic compounds in soil. Plants and bacteria can form specific associations in which the plant provides the bacteria with a specific carbon source that induces the bacteria to reduce the phytotoxicity of the contaminated soil. Alternatively, plants and bacteria can form nonspecific associations in which normal plant processes stimulate the microbial community, which in the course of normal metabolic activity degrades contaminants in soil. Plants can provide carbon substrates and nutrients, as well as increase contaminant solubility. These biochemical mechanisms increase the degradative activity of bacteria associated with plant roots. In return, bacteria can augment the degradative capacity of plants or reduce the phytotoxicity of the contaminated soil. However, the specificity of the plant-bacteria interaction is dependent upon soil conditions, which can alter contaminant bioavailability, root exudate composition, and nutrient levels. In addition, the metabolic requirements for contaminant degradation may also dictate the form of the plant-bacteria interaction i.e., specific or nonspecific. No systematic framework that can predict plant-bacteria interactions in a contaminated soil has emerged, but it appears that the development of plant-bacteria associations that degrade contaminants in soil may be related to the presence of allelopathic chemicals in the rhizosphere. Therefore, investigations into plants that are resistant to or produce allelopathic chemicals is suggested as one possible method of identifying plant-bacteria associations that can degrade contaminants in soil.","Bacterial inoculants; Mechanisms; Phytoremediation; Rhizosphere","Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0002503662

The LHC II aggregates showed a typical band at 697-700 nm (F699) in low-temperature emission spectra. Its excitation spectrum corresponded to that of detergent-solubilized LHC II. Formation of F699 in stressed plants was not reversed in the dark and leaves did not contain any zeaxanthin showing that neither a light-induced transthylakoid pH gradient nor zeaxanthin was required for LHC II aggregation. The CO2-stressed plants showed clear signs of photodamage: depression of the potential yield of photosystem II photochemistry (Fv/ FM) by 50-70% and a decline in chlorophyll content by 10-15%. Therefore, we propose that the photodamage to the photosynthetic apparatus is the cause of the LHC II aggregation in plants. The F699 exhibited a reversible decrease of its intensity upon irradiation of leaves with intensive light. There was no or only slight decrease around 700 nm in unstressed plants. The nonphotochemical quenching of chlorophyll fluorescence showed the opposite relation, being higher before than after the strong CO2 deficit.

In this perspective the CALGRID modelling system has been applied to Milan metropolitan area, located in the Po Valley, the most industrialised and populated area in Italy. For the first modelling exercise, a simulation domain of 100 x 100 km2 has been considered and a summer period, characterised by high photochemical activity, has been selected. Hourly emissions have been derived by spatially and temporally disaggregating national inventories data, while standard upper-air and ground-based meteorological data have been used as input to the CALMET pre-processor. A careful analysis of simulation results versus local network monitoring data has revealed some critical points, related to both modelling assumptions and practical data availability. A satisfactory reproduction of daytime ozone behaviour has been, in fact, accomplished, both in urban and suburban sites, while nighttime primary pollutants accumulations and consequent ozone consumption simulated by the model have not found correspondence in the measurements. Nitrogen dioxide has been also successfully modelled, mostly in city surroundings, whereas higher discrepancies have been found in some urban stations. Possible explanations of these facts are discussed in the paper, giving an insight for further work.","CALGRID; Eulerian modelling; Milan; Urban ozone","Italy; Milan metropolitan area; Photochemical grid model; Computer simulation; Geographical regions; Impurities; Nitrogen compounds; Ozone; Particulate emissions; Photochemical reactions; Air pollution; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; air pollution; modeling; pollutant transport; urban area; atmospheric pollution; metropolitan area; modelling approach; ozone; pollution monitoring; urban environment; urban pollution; air monitoring; air pollution; article; italy; model; photochemistry; priority journal; urban area; Italy, Lombardy, Milan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032101858

Two complementary in situ techniques, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM), were used in this work to study the gasification of an activated charcoal catalyzed by the two metal oxides, their eutectic alloy and the binary mixture with the eutectic composition. Gasification experiments were carried out at relatively low temperatures (300-650°C) in an XRD cell (1 atm) and ESEM (2.2 Torr) to monitor phase transformations and morphological changes of oxide catalysts, respectively. The experimental results showed that MoO3 and V2O5 particles in contact with active carbon surfaces are reduced to oxides with lower oxidation states, e.g. MoO2 and V6O13, respectively. The reduction of MoO3 to MoO2 on the carbon surface prevents the sublimation of MoO3 which takes place readily on a quartz surface under the same conditions. The formation of V6O13, on the other hand, causes more extensive spreading of the catalyst on carbon surfaces, since V6O13 has a lower melting point than V2O5. Based on the XRD and ESEM observations, it is clear that phase transformations of metal oxides during gasification depend on their interactions with carbon surfaces. The phase transformations of the metal oxides, play, in turn, a significant role in carbon gasification, as evident from the kinetic data obtained for the catalytic gasification of the activated charcoal sample. The synergy observed between the components of the eutectic mixture is discussed, comparing the XRD and ESEM observations. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.","A.

A chemical evolution code follows the star formation rate, the gas fraction, and the metallicity, basic ingredients for the stellar population synthesis. The latter is performed with a grid of integrated spectra of simple stellar populations (SSP) of different ages and metallicities, in which the effects of dusty envelopes around asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are included. The residual fraction of gas in the galaxy is divided into two phases: the star-forming molecular clouds and the diffuse medium. The relative amount is a model parameter. The molecular gas is subdivided into clouds of given mass and radius: it is supposed that each SSP is born within the cloud and progressively escapes it. The emitted spectrum of the star-forming molecular clouds is computed with a radiative transfer code. The diffuse dust emission (cirrus) is derived by describing the galaxy as an axially symmetric system, in which the local dust emissivity is consistently calculated as a function of the local field intensity due to the stellar component. Effects of very small grains, subject to temperature fluctuations, as well as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are included. The model is compared and calibrated with available data of normal and starburst galaxies in the local universe, in particular new broadband and spectroscopic Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) observations. It will be a powerful tool to investigate the star formation, the initial mass function (IMF), supernova rate (SNR) in nearby starbursts and normal galaxies, as well as to predict the evolution of luminosity functions of different types of galaxies at wavelengths covering four decades. © 1993 The American Astronomical Society.

The corresponding ground states were determined according to four BORT models. In the first three models a diagonalisation of the Hückel-type Hamiltonian was performed in the bases of Kekulé, of Kekulé and mono-Claus and of Kekulé and Claus resonance structures, respectively. In the fourth model a simple BORT ansatz was used. According to this ansatz, the ground state is a linear combination of the positive Kekulé structures, all with equal coefficients. It was shown that π-electron energies and bond orders obtained by these models correlate much better with the PPP energies and bond orders than with the Hückel energies and bond orders. This indicates that a simple BORT approach is quite reliable in predicting the more sophisticated PPP results. Concerning the relative performance of the four BORT models, the best results were obtained with the BORT ansatz. The performance deteriorates with the expansion of the basis set. This is attributed to the fact that in these models the improvement of the basis set is not accompanied with the corresponding improvement of the Hamiltonian. Comparing the BORT-ansatz bond orders with the Pauling bond orders, it was shown that BORT-ansatz bond orders correlate much better with the PPP bond orders.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032355174

To assess whether sodic soils reclaimed by tree plantations can be used for growing agricultural crops, a greenhouse pot trial was conducted during winter of 1994-95 (November-April) at the Central Soil Salinity Research Institute, Karnal, India. Wheat (Triticum aestivum, L; cultivar HD 2329) and oat (Avena sativa, L. cultivar local) plants were grown in topsoils (30 cm) collected from 24-year-old plantations of Prosopis juliflora, Acacia nilotica, Eucalpytus tereticornis, Terminalia arjuna and Albizia lebbek that had been established in 1970 on a highly sodic soil (pH2 10.2-10.5), and a reclaimed sodic soil from a farm field adjacent to the plantations. The organic carbon content and nutrient status of the soil under the 24-year-old plantations was much higher than that of a reference farm soil reclaimed through gypsum in 1974. Soil amelioration was highest under Prosopis canopies (pH 7.4 and organic carbon 0.89 per cent) in topsoil and minimum in Eucalpytus canopies (pH 8.6 and organic carbon 0.56 per cent). Reduced sodicity and improved fertility resulted in much better growth reference and productivity of the wheat and oat test crops grown on the five plantation soils, than in the reference farm soil. Grain and straw yields of wheat and oats were maximum in Prosopis soil (wheat 61.7 g grains and 87.5 g straw and oats 87.9 g grains and 111.1 g straw per pot) and minimum in Eucalpytus soil (32.3 and 25.3 g, and 42.7 and 58.5 g per pot). Grain yields of both wheat and oats obtained in the Prosopis soil were 4.5 and 3.5 times more, respectively, than obtained in the reference farm soil. The phosphorus concentration in whole plant tissues of wheat and oats was highest in Prosopis soils reflecting the prevailing phosphorus status and better restoration processes of the soils. Potassium concentration was little affected due to different soil treatments. The study clearly indicated that prolonged afforestation of sodic soils by tree plantations, particularly by Prosopis and Acacia trees, may restore the productivity of abandoned soils to much above the present agricultural production levels. The results further suggest that 24 years' occupation of sodic soils by trees, such as Prosopis, Acacia, Eucalyptus, Terminalia and Albizia, did not result in a build-up or accumulation of toxic allelochemicals which could be injurious to wheat and oats cultivation on such soils. © 1998 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.","Bioamelioration; Fertility; Oat; Productivity; Sodicity; Soil restoration; Tree plantations; Wheat","afforestation; crop production; sodic soil; soil fertility; soil remediation; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032420098

This technology has now been extended to diesel powered vehicles and a number of manufacturers are fitting oxidation catalysts as standard. This work presents experimental data to show the effectiveness of oxidation catalyst technology in reducing exhaust HC emissions from a modern high speed diesel engine. It tested the ability of the catalyst to reduce HC emissions at a range of steady state speed and load combinations to assess the controlling factors in catalyst efficiency. The work found that exhaust gas temperature is the most significant controlling factor in determining catalyst efficiency. This is significant because at low speed and load the exhaust of a diesel engine is below the light off temperature of the catalyst. This brings into question the effectiveness of this catalyst application as the cost of applying it may outweigh the potential benefits.

Near-infrared images, spectra, and optical rotation curves were presented in Smith et al. In this paper, we use these data and published radio data to assess the stellar populations, dust contents, ionizing conditions, and dynamics of the starbursts. Certain properties of the star formation occurring in these galaxies differ from those observed locally. The infrared excesses (IREs) are lower than and span a narrower range of values than those of Galactic H II regions. The starbursts appear to produce a higher proportion of ionizing photons than most Galactic H II regions. Consequently, the initial mass functions (IMFs) of the starbursts may be more strongly biased toward high-mass star formation. The starbursts may also contain fewer old H II regions than the Milky Way. Furthermore, the starburst IRE is likely to be influenced by the presence of large reservoirs of gas that absorb a larger fraction of the Lyman continuum photons. The OB stellar and far-infrared luminosities imply that the upper mass range of the starburst IMF (M &gt; 10 M⊙) is characterized by a slope of 2.7 ± 0.2. The starburst IMF thus bears a strong similarity to that observed in Magellanic OB associations. Optical line ratios indicate that a range of excitation conditions are present. We conclude that the near-infrared light from many of the starbursts is dominated by a heavily obscured mixture of emission from evolved red stars and young blue stars with small contributions (≈5%) from thermal gas and hot dust, under the assumptions that a Galactic or SMC extinction law can be applied to these systems and that the true reddening curve follows one of the models currently existing in the literature. In some cases, larger amounts of emission from blue stars or hot dust may be required to explain the observed near-infrared colors. The amount of dust emission exceeds that predicted from comparisons with Galactic H II regions. The near-infrared colors of some of the systems may also be influenced by the presence of a low-luminosity active galactic nucleus (AGN). Emission from blue stars and hot dust, if present, dilutes the observed CO index. The activity in the redder, more luminous systems is strongly peaked. The galaxies hosting the starbursts exhibit a wide range of morphological and star-forming properties. While all of the host galaxies are interacting systems, the nuclear separations of the interacting nuclei range from &lt;1 kpc to &gt; 1 Mpc. The dynamical behavior ranges from relaxed to strongly perturbed. The off-nuclear regions of the galaxies are sites of active star formation and are characterized by a range of excitation conditions. Spatially extended LINER emission is consistent with shock excitation produced by superwinds or galaxy-galaxy collisions. Violent star formation activity occurs over a larger physical scale in the most active starbursts. Systems containing mergers and widely separated nuclei possess similar colors and luminosities. The burst properties are most likely regulated by the internal structures of the interacting galaxies and not the separations of the interacting galaxies. © 1998. The American Astronomical Society.

A corresponding reduction in CO emissions from 810 to 190 ppm (0% O2 basis) and an increase in carbon burnout from 84 to 92% were achieved without any increase in NOx emissions, which were in the region of 85-100 ppm (0% O2). © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The reacting experiments, conducted in a 130-kW rotary kiln simulator, showed that flame ignition distance is reduced by more than a factor of 2 compared to a monochannel flame by use of a precessing jet of air to enlarge the scale of mixing in the emerging coal jet. NOx emissions are reduced from more than 200 ppm to 80 ppm (0% O2) by using precessing jet burners. Qualitative cold-flow visualization studies demonstrated that precessing airflows break up the surrounding annular flow, simulating a coal transport flow, into much larger turbulent flow structures, causing increased residence times in the pre-ignition region. Particle-imaging techniques in a nonreacting flow show that, in the pre-ignition region, the motion of the smaller particles (&lt;30 lm) are affected by the large flow structures and form clusters with long residence times. Flame stability improvements are attributed to increased particle heating rates in the clusters by radiation due to increased absorptivity and increased residence time in the near burner zone. The NOx reduction can be explained by the generation of large-scale particle clusters that provide local instantaneous fuel-rich combustion environments. This work demonstrates that the production of large-scale clustering effects has the potential to provide an alternative means to simultaneously control NOx and improve flame stability relative to existing staging techniques, which control the mean stoichiometry of various flame zones.",,"Flame stabilization; Pulverized fuel flames; Coal combustion; Flow visualization; Gas emissions; Jets; Nitrogen oxides; Rotary kilns; Stoichiometry; Turbulence; Flame research",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032272147

Cogeneration, the combined generation of steam and electricity, is an efficient and cost-effective means to save energy and reduce pollution. Many studies around the world have identified sugar mill cogeneration as an attractive low-cost power option. Most studies estimate the cogeneration potential of India's sugar mills at around 3500 MWe. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has implemented a Greenhouse Gas Pollution Prevention (GEP) Project to assist in the direction and pace of India's power sector development. This seven-year, US$19 million effort is funded through the United States' contribution to the pilot phase of the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). The GEF's mission is to assist developing countries in investing in environmental protection initiatives that yield global benefits in terms of reduced or avoided greenhouse gas emissions. Technical aspects of the GEP Project are being managed by the United States Department of Energy's Pittsburgh Energy Technology Center. The objective of the Advanced Bagasse Cogeneration (ABC) Component of the GEP Project is to promote year-round cogeneration in Indian sugar mills with power export using only biomass as a fuel. The structure of the ABC Component, which is implemented through technical assistance and investment subcomponents, and the status of various activities are reviewed. Also, sugar production and economics are reviewed from both a global and local perspective to reveal how they impact the potential for cogeneration projects in Indian sugar mills. Progress in the Indian sugar industry should pave the way for cogeneration projects in other industrial sectors, such as paper, chemicals, and textiles. Contributions from these sectors are important if India is to meet its huge power generation needs.","Biomass cogeneration; India; Sugar industry","Cogeneration plants; Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Electric power generation; Sugar factories; Sugar industry; Biomass cogeneration; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032025331

The jets entrain substantial quantities of product gases that have cooled by furnace heat transfer. Thus fuel and oxidant enter the subsequent combustion zone much diluted by cooled products, depressing reaction temperatures and reactant concentrations and so greatly reducing NO(x) emissions. In the present realization, FODI is implemented in a patented unitary burner providing a plurality of oxidant jets surrounded by a plurality of fuel jets, suitable for retrofit as well as new installations and particularly advantageous for applications with air preheat. We here present results of experimental investigation and theoretical analysis of the burner performance. Characteristic of FODI, NO(x) reduction is won at an expense to combustion stability, confining steady-state operation to furnace refractory temperatures above about 870°C and exhaust gas temperatures above about 1000°C. The NO(x) emissions vary strongly with the temperature of the recirculating furnace gases; when the furnace load is substantial, that temperature falls much below the adiabatic combustion level and NO(x) is very low. By appropriate choice of burner design parameters, reasonably small combustion zones are obtained, avoiding wall impingement and enhancing stability. The analysis given of burner behavior, particularly in respect to combustion aerodynamics, is revealing in respect to mechanisms and provides a basis for assessing effects of variations in design, including scaleup. The present is the first systematic investigation of a system employing FODI, and the general analysis is pertinent to other FODI implementations. This is a new and challenging field for combustion research, involving complex mixing processes coupled with nonadiabatic reaction at unusually low temperatures and concentrations. Much work remains to be done on the detailed mechanisms of mixing and reaction and on the development of appropriate mathematical modeling.",,"Combustion; Direct injection; Fuel burners; Fuels; Furnaces; Heat transfer; Mixing; Oxidants; Combustion aerodynamics; Combustion stability; Exhaust gas temperatures; Experimental investigations; Furnace refractories; Performance characteristics; Reactant concentrations; Steady-state operation; Fighter aircraft; fuel; airflow; article; combustion; furnace; heat transfer; heating; oxidation; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031746488

We use a single data set comprising oxygen, nitrate, ammonium and organic carbon versus depth profiles from a slope station in the Goban Spur area (1034 m, Northeast Atlantic). Based on an extensive sensitivity analysis, it appears that (1) when using all data, the total mineralization rates can be determined with reasonable precision; bioturbation and degradability are less well constrained and (2) total mineralization rates can be determined based on nitrate and oxygen profiles only; estimates of organic matter mixing rates and degradability are refined when including the solid phase organic carbon profile. The bulk mixing rates obtained for organic carbon are one order of magnitude higher than mixing rates previously estimated from 210Pb profiles, lending validity to the hypothesis that organic particles are mixed faster than inert particles. The degradability of the organic carbon prior to its incorporation in the sediment is in the order of 10-30 yr-1, indicating that mineralization in this slope station of the Goban Spur area is fueled mainly by freshly deposited organic matter.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031718797

This trend is epitomized by the federal Acid Rain Program and the RECLAIM program for smog control in the Los Angeles basin. The adoption of these programs for attainment of the ozone standard is problematic, because of vexing issues of geography, atmospheric chemistry, source coverage, and monitoring and enforcement. These issues are especially salient in the use of emission reduction credit (ERC) trading systems. Cap and trade programs circumvent some of these difficulties by limiting total emissions and increasing source coverage but may still face monitoring challenges. Finally, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is currently proposing that states use another incentive program, known as Open Market Trading. Michigan and Illinois have both developed new market incentive programs for ozone compliance. Michigan adopted an ERC model for NOx and VOCs, while Illinois opted for a cap and trade program to reduce VOCs in the Chicago area. Though these programs are fairly young, their strengths and weaknesses can be identified. Problems with the Michigan program are so serious that it has been initially disapproved by the EPA out of concern that down-state areas could backslide into non-attainment status. Among the concerns are pre-enactment ERCs and counting ERC generation from facility shutdowns and curtailments. Although the Illinois program is more promising, it has problems of its own, such as low emission source coverage. Nonetheless, it is only through experimentation with market programs that their ultimate utility for ozone compliance can be determined. © 1998 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"Cost effectiveness; Environmental protection; Industrial emissions; Laws and legislation; Ozone; Public policy; Strategic planning; Cap and trade programs; Emission reduction credit (ERC) trading systems; Open market trading systems; Air pollution control; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air pollution; article; environmental protection; law; model; priority journal; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032374038

The model should describe the cycling of oxygen, nitrogen, and phosphorus in both water and sediment, and should be compatible with the ASM to support the development of integrated emission reduction strategies. The model should be particularly well suited to handle problems characterized by significant temporal and spatial influences (e.g. CSOs and NPSs). It should serve for research, education, improved communication, knowledge transfer, regulatory applications such as catchment planning, and improved data collection. Anticipated results of the Task Group effort include: (i) standardized conversion sub-models; (ii) a decision support tool to guide model construction and usage; and (iii) case study applications.

The report focuses on municipal wastewater treatment for three reasons: an analysis of economic scenarios and associated environmental consequences indicates that emissions of BOD and several other water pollutants decline only at a small extent as a result of economic transformation, even if large reductions indudstrial emissions occur. Households and small sources dominate the discharge of these water pollutants. The investment requirement to improve the existing situation would be an enormous burden even for stable eocnomies. As described below, the current state of water supply and sewerage collection is generally adequate. In some countries, new investments in water supply are proposed mostly for industrial purposes rather than improving the quality of water resources.

The composition and the structure of the surface region were investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), ion scattering spectroscopy (ISS) and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The results show that exposing the amorphous alloys to 500 mbar O 2 at 523 K led to oxidized surfaces consisting of zirconia and different oxidic nickel species. On the oxidized Ni 24 Zr 76 surface, only small amounts of NiO and Ni 2 O 3 were found, while Ni 2 O 3 was detected as the major Ni-containing species on the oxidized Ni 36 Zr 64 surface. Oxidation of Ni in the alloys appeared to be inhibited by the presence of metallic Zr and started only after complete oxidation of the surrounding Zr. Annealing the oxidized alloys to 773 K led to a reduction of the surface oxides. The liberated oxygen atoms presumably diffused into the bulk, releasing metallic Ni. At the topmost layer, zirconia was reduced by carbon atoms originating from the bulk to form a ZrC-like surface compound. The exchange of Ni and Zr atoms between the surface and the bulk was enhanced by the oxidation and the annealing. The preferential oxidation of zirconium, which attracts Zr atoms from the bulk to the surface, provides the driving force for such processes. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

During the past fifteen years this industry has changed in many aspects: California cultivars were replaced in about 50% of the total commercial fields by new short-day Israeli cultivars grown mainly for early winter production and export. The traditional open field growing on raised beds has been partially replaced by walk-in constructions, thus decreasing exposure of plants to fluctuations in climatic conditions and improving working conditions for farmers. Research on strawberry viruses was begun in the early eighties and resulted in numerous publications and research reports. A virus indexing system based primarily on selected Fragaria indicators was established and applied to imported cultivars and advanced lines from the local breeding program. Intensive searches for aphids indicated that the major aphid vectors of strawberry viruses are very rare. Based on these observations we decided to focus virus testing on pre-nuclear and nuclear stock plants. Regulations concerning strawberry propagation stock were established in Israel and made compulsory. The potential of fresh fruit export has not yet been exhausted and can still be expanded. However, the recent growing involvement of the private sector in breeding programs, the shortage of research funds and the low priority given to labor-intensive agriculture indeveloped countries are affecting research activities, a prerequisite for progress in this and other crops. In my opinion, a change in funding strategy as well as a close cooperation among plant breeders, research scientists, plant protection services, extension service staff and growers will ensure long-term, successful strawberry growing industry in Israel.",,"Aphididae; Fragaria; Fragaria x ananassa",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879236482

On this day, instruments onboard the helicopter separately sampled air from within a plume emanating from a nearby coal-fired power plant and air from the Nashville urban plume. Using SO2 concentrations and latitude to discriminate between the plumes, we compare the effects on O3 production of only adding NOx to the background air (i.e., the power plant plume) to that of adding both NOx and VOC (i.e., the urban plume). Our analysis indicates that NOx was the prime anthropogenic precursor causing the generation of O3 during the experiment, with anthropogenic VOC perhaps playing a secondary but significant role. The addition of VOC emissions from the urban area had no appreciable effect on peak O3 concentrations, clearly demonstrating that anthropogenic NOx emissions by themselves can produce elevated O3 concentrations in the Nashville area. Anthropogenic VOC emissions, however, may have enhanced the ozone production efficiencies and the rate at which O3 reached its peak values. While not conclusive, the data also suggested that the highest O3 concentrations in the Nashville area on July 11, 1995, appeared within embedded plumes that combined the effects of both urban and power plant precursor emissions.

In steady state, the etch rate and the surface modifications of silicon do not change as a function of time. The surface modifications were characterized by in situ ellipsometry and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The contribution of direct ion impact on the silicon substrate to the etching mechanism is reduced with increasing fluorocarbon layer thickness. Therefore, we consider that the silicon etch rate is controlled by a neutral etchant flux through the layer. Our experimental data show, however, that ions play an import role in the transport of silicon etching precursors through the layer. A model is developed that describes the etch kinetics through a fluorocarbon layer based on a fluorine diffusion transport mechanism. The model is consistent with the data when one or two of the following roles of the ions on the etching process are assumed. The first role is an enhancement in the diffusivity of fluorine atoms through the fluorocarbon layer and an enhancement in the reaction probability of fluorine in the fluorocarbon layer. In this case the fluorine is assumed to originate from the gas phase. The second role includes ion fragmentation and dissociation of the fluorocarbon surface molecules. © 1998 American Vacuum Society.",,"Atoms; Diffusion; Ellipsometry; Fluorine; Fluorocarbons; Ions; Mathematical models; Molecular dynamics; Reaction kinetics; Silicon; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Ion fragmentation; Neutral etchant flux; Plasma etching",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031672938

In the case of (deoxy)ribosephosphates the six-membered transition state is possible for transfer of the hydrogen at C4 to the phosphate group at C5 as well as at C3. In DNA, the resulting C4'-radical will undergo a rapid β-elimination of the phosphate-ester group, this step representing the DNA chain break.

But it is unlikely, that the high flux observed in the energy band 3 - 10 MeV during Phase II of the COMPTEL observations, is due to a significant contribution of this source.

Here we study the fundamental process of the development of this volcanic radiative forcing, focusing on the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines on June 15, 1991. We develop a spectral-, space-, and time-dependent set of aerosol parameters for 2 years after the Pinatubo eruption using a combination of SAGE II aerosol extinctions and UARS-retrieved effective radii, supported by SAM II, AVHRR, lidar and balloon observations. Using these data, we calculate the aerosol radiative forcing with the ECHAM4 general circulation model (GCM) for cases with climatological and observed sea surface temperature (SST), as well as with and without climate response. We find that the aerosol radiative forcing is not sensitive to the climate variations caused by SST or the atmospheric response to the aerosols, except in regions with varying dense cloudiness. The solar forcing in the near infrared contributes substantially to the total stratospheric heating. A complete formulation of radiative forcing should include not only changes of net fluxes at the tropopause but also the vertical distribution of atmospheric heating rates and the change of downward thermal and net solar radiative fluxes at the surface. These forcing and aerosol data are available for GCM experiments with any spatial and spectral resolution.

There are two states of the world: one in which climate policy is purely based on intrinsic motivation in the sense of intergenerational altruism; one in which agents distrust voluntary cooperation, but have agreed to provide an extrinsic stimulus for greenhouse gas abatement through a system of tradable carbon rights. The main results can be summarized as follows: First, a high degree of intergenerational altruism might support 'sustainable' atmospheric carbon concentration, but imposes high welfare losses on current generations. Second, if agents realize that greenhouse policy is an alternative to investing into physical capital, then even without integenerational altruism a pareto-efficient internalization of the external effect of climate change will stabilize the atmospheric carbon concentration at ecologically sustainable levels, but at significantly lower economic costs.",,"carbon emissions; discount rate; emissions control; environmental economics; greenhouse gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0345367914

Stn., Three Rivers, CA 93271-9700, United States","Correlative approaches to understanding the climatic controls of vegetation distribution have exhibited at least two important weaknesses: they have been conceptually divorced across spatial scales, and their climatic parameters have not necessarily represented aspects of climate of broad physiological importance to plants. Using examples from the literature and from the Sierra Nevada of California, I argue that two water balance parameters-actual evapotranspiration (AET) and deficit (D)-are biologically meaningful, are well correlated with the distribution of vegetation types, and exhibit these qualities over several orders of magnitude of spatial scale (continental to local). I reach four additional conclusions. (1) Some pairs of climatic parameters presently in use are functionally similar to AET and D; however, AET and D may be easier to interpret biologically. (2) Several well-known climatic parameters are biologically less meaningful or less important than AET and D, and consequently are poorer correlates of the distribution of vegetation types. Of particular interest, AET is a much better correlate of the distributions of coniferous and deciduous forests than minimum temperature. (3) The effects of evaporative demand and water availability on a site's water balance are intrinsically different. For example, the 'dry' experienced by plants on sunward slopes (high evaporative demand) is not comparable to the 'dry' experienced by plants on soils with low water-holding capacities (low water availability), and these differences are reflected in vegetation patterns. (4) Many traditional topographic moisture scalars-those that additively combine measures related to evaporative demand and water availability are not necessarily meaningful for describing site conditions as sensed by plants; the same holds for measured soil moisture. However, using AET and D in place of moisture scalars and measured soil moisture can solve these problems.","Bioclimatology; Climate; Climatic indices; Forest physiognomy; Moisture scalars; Sierra Nevada; Water balance","biogeography; climate; evapotranspiration; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032419602

In this study, five functionally related annual native species were exposed to different combinations of ambient and elevated [CO2] and temperatures in order to assess their response in terms of growth and allometry. Fast-growing annuals were selected for the study because their growth responses could be assessed over a major portion of the plant's life cycle and in as short a period as 8 wk. Plants were grown in eight hemi-spherical glasshouses, programmed to track outside ambient conditions and provide a replicated experimental design. Treatments comprised (i) current ambient [CO2] and temperature, (ii) elevated [CO2] (ambien + 34 kPa), and ambient temperature (iii) ambient [CO2] and elevated temperature (ambient+3 °C) and (iv) elevated [CO2] and elevated temperature (T °C(elev)). All five species responded positively to [CO2](elev), although the response was statistically significant for only one, Poa annua L. Averaged over all five species, [CO2](elev) increased total plant biomass by 25 % (P = 0.005) at 56 d, reflecting a proportionally greater increase in leaf and stem mass relative to root weight. Elevated [CO2] had no effect on leaf area, either at the individual species level or overall. Elevated T °C, by contrast, had little effect on shoot growth but increased root mass on average by 43 % and leaf area by 22%. Few interactions between elevated [CO2] and T °C were observed, with the CO2 response generally greater at elevated than ambient T °C. Both [CO2](elev) and T °C(elev) resulted in a transient increase in relative growth rate, (RGR), during the first 14 d exposure and a 3 °C increase in temperature had no effect on the duration of the response. CO2 stimulation of growth operated through a sustained increase in net assimilation rate. (NAR), although the potential benefit to RGR was offset by a concurrent decline in leaf area ratio (LAR), as a result of a decrease in leaf area per unit leaf mass (SLA). The response to T °C(elev) was generally opposite of that to [CO2](elev). For example, T °C(elev) increased LAR through an increase in SLA and this, rather than any effect on NAR, was the major factor responsible for the stimulation of RGR. Allometric analysis of CO2 effects revealed that changes in allocation observed at individual harvests were due solely to changes associated with plant size. Elevated T °C, by contrast, had a direct effect on allocation patterns to leaves, with an increase in leaf area expansion relative to whole plant mass during the initial stages of growth and subsequent increased allocation of biomass away from leaves to other regions of the plant. No change in the allometric relation between roots and shoots were observed at either elevated [CO2] or T °C. We conclude, therefore, that allocation of biomass and morphological characteristics such as SLA, are relatively insensitive to [CO2], at least when analysed at the whole-plant level, and where changes have been observed, these are the product of comparing plants of the same age but different size.","Allometry; Carbon dioxide; Growth; Partitioning; Temperature","allometry; carbon dioxide enrichment; growth response; plant; temperature effect; Poa; Poa annua; Poa annua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031757128

Respiratory-modulated neuronal activities were recorded in this region in decerebrate, vagotomized, paralyzed, and ventilated cats, having bilateral carotid sinus nerve sections. As end-tidal partial pressures of carbon dioxide were reduced to hypocapnic levels, all neuronal activities which were tonic or expiratory-inspiratory ( 'pre-inspiratory') either ceased or lost respiratory-modulation. Similarly, most expiratory and inspiratory-expiratory activities did not maintain a phasic discharge. Half of the inspiratory neuronal activities did continue a phasic discharge, which commenced after phrenic activity or became independent of the phrenic rhythm. Results do not support a fundamental role of the 'pre-Botzinger' complex in the neurogenesis of eupnea. Some neuronal activities can establish a phasic discharge in hypocapnia which is independent of the central respiratory rhythm. At normocapnia, this independent discharge is superseded and incorporated into the ponto-medullary respiratory neuronal circuit which generates eupnea.

Biogenic emissions would be expected to contribute an even larger fraction of the VOC emissions on the regional scale than within urban areas. We used a new atmospheric chemistry mechanism, the Regional Atmospheric Chemistry Mechanism (RACM), to perform ozone reactivity calculations to investigate the effects of biogenic emissions on the production of photooxidants in the atmosphere.

Separate preparations of vegetable oil and polybutene were used, emulsified with nonionic polysaccharide surfactants. Rather large contrast variations were found between the oil and water phases, with water always appearing brighter whether it was in the dispersed or continuous phase. The observed contrast is attributed to variations in the secondary electron emission characteristics arising from the dielectric response function of water compared with hydrocarbons. We propose that delocalized electrons in π-bonds provide an energy absorbing mechanism that leads to a reduction in secondary electron emission from unsaturated hydrocarbon oils, relative to that of water, by lowering the energy gap.

Data is obtained from the University of Waterloo entry in the 1997 Propane Vehicle Challenge. A key feature of the design strategy is its focus on testing and emissions while preserving low engine speed power for drivability. Major changes to the Dakota truck included the following: installation of a custom shaped fuel tank, inclusion of a fuel temperature control module, addition of a vaporizer and a fuel delivery metering unit, installation of a custom vapour distribution manifold, addition of an equivalence ratio electronic controller, inclusion of a wide range oxygen sensor, addition of an exhaust gas recirculation cooler and installation of thermal insulation on the exhaust system. A competition provided natural gas catalyst was used. LARGE URBAN CENTERS around the world are faced with the challenge of reducing overall air pollution. With this task in mind, it is evident that automotive exhaust causes a large percentage of hazardous emissions in the environment we live in [1]. The efforts made by large automotive distributors towards reducing emissions should be commended but the problem will continue to increase as population increases [2]. Consequently, this interest in emissions has stimulated the search for alternative fuels to power motorized vehicles. Therefore, a competition amongst North American universities and colleges was issued as a way to meet this challenge with new and innovative ideas [3]. The 1997 Propane Vehicle Challenge (PVC) is designed to allow post-secondary institutions to embark on a current real world engineering problem. The objective of the competition is to successfully convert a 1995 Dodge Dakota pickup truck to dedicated propane, while improving exhaust emissions, and maintaining the original drivability and performance of the vehicle [4]. This paper details the approach used by the University of Waterloo team in achieving a successful propane conversion. From the beginning, the propane conversion team decided to make exhaust emissions reduction their main focus, possibly at the expense of other driving characteristics. This decision was based on the heavy weighting given to emissions reduction. Despite the small number of team members, modifications were made to the fuel storage, fuel delivery, engine, controls, and exhaust emissions systems. The PVC represents the first time a University of Waterloo team has competed in a fuel conversion competition. This paper outlines the following topics related to the conversion of the truck to dedicated propane use: team structure, sponsorship, team strategies, modifications undertaken, and summary results.

Geophysical Research Institute, Hyderabad 500 007, India","Geochemical, Sr-isotopic and geochronological data on the major granitic activity in the south Indian shield suggest a. significant event of intracrustal melting and differentiation processes, particularly at middle- and lower crustal levels, resulting in irreversible geochemicat differentiation of the crustal column into a large ion lithophile (LIL) element - depleted anhydrous lower crust and an upper crust characterised by copious granitic activity, marking the Archean-Proterozoic boundary. A perceptible link between the formation of granulites in the lower crust and the granitic activity in the upper crust is recognised in this region. Major element geochemistry of the granites suggests an anatectic origin for these granites. The geochemical signatures of the granites in the Closepet, Hampi (Kamataka), Lepakshi, Kadiri, Tanakallu and Hyderabad regions (Andhra Pradesh) suggest that the source regions for the granitic melts were mainly the juvenile crustal additions of the tonalilte-trondhjemite-granodiorite (TTG) types at lower crustal levels. Sources which had little crustal residence time are indicated by relatively low initial strontium isotopic ratios. This granitic activity was mostly of the granodiorite, quartz-monzonite and granite types which exhibit I-type character. These granites usually have highly fractionated REE patterns, mostly with negative Eu anomalies, implying significant fractionation of palgioclase into the residue and the strong effects of intracrustal differentiation processes. The heat required for melting might have been provided by crustal thickening and radioactive decay processes, with possible involvement of minor amounts of mantle input at times. CO2,- streaming, which reduces considerably the melting temperatures and helps in the removal of LILE into the melt, may also have played an important role. Most of the granites have geochemical characteristics of origins in volcanic arc or syn-collisional settings, suggesting the operation of plate tectonic processes and crustal accretion mechanisms during the Archaean-Proterozoic transition in the south Indian shield. Proterozoic crustal accretion and the granitic crustal differentiation contributed to relative stability of the continental crust and resulted in cratonisation process.","Archaean-proterozoic transition; Crustal evolution; Granites; Intracrustal processes; LIL elements","differentiation; geochronology; granite; igneous geochemistry; melting; Proterozoic; strontium isotope; trigger mechanism; Indian Shield",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000609432

The results confirmed that the oxidation of isopropanol obeys the same reaction mechanism on the basal planes (S.-G. Sun, Y. Lin, Electrochim. Acta 41 (1996) 693) as well as on the stepped surfaces. It was determined that acetone (characterized by IR bands around 1698, 1430, 1368, 1238 and 1157 cm-1) and carbon dioxide (depicted by an IR band near 2345 cm-1) are the main product species involved in isopropanol oxidation. The production rate of acetone (represented by kC=O) and carbon dioxide (denoted by kCO2) in isopropanol oxidation at different potentials and on different Pt single crystal electrodes has been evaluated quantitatively from in situ time-resolved FTIR spectroscopic data. The different variations of kC=O and kCO2 demonstrated that the kinetics of the oxidation varies significantly with the Pt single crystal electrode orientation. It was shown that on all five Pt single crystal electrodes the maximum value of kC=O is always larger than that of kCO2, signifying that the production of acetone is faster than that of carbon dioxide in isopropanol oxidation. From the values of kC=O and kCO2, the activity of Pt single crystal electrodes for producing both acetone and carbon dioxide has been classified. It has been found that Pt(610) is the most active surface for yielding carbon dioxide. The order of activity for producing carbon dioxide of the five electrodes is Pt(610)&gt;Pt(111)&gt;Pt(100)&gt;Pt(211)&gt;Pt(110). Two potential regions are distinguished for the production of acetone in isopropanol oxidation, one between 0.20 and 0.80 V/SCE and the other from 0.80 to 1.20 V. The activity of the five Pt single crystal electrodes in the first potential region is Pt(100)&gt;Pt(610)&gt; Pt(211)&gt;Pt(111)&gt;Pt(110), and in the second potential region it is Pt(110)&gt;Pt(111)&gt;Pt(211)&gt;Pt(100)&gt;Pt(610).

Specifically, the phenomena tested include perfectly stirred reactor responses, autoignition and shock-tube ignition delay times, laminar flame propagation speeds, and ignition-extinction limits of counterflowing systems, whereas the thermodynamical parametric variations include those of temperature, pressure, and composition.

The purpose of the present study is how to reduce lead absorption in children. The main objectives are environmental health assessment of lead in the Copsa-Mica area, and communication and risk management strategies. The study population comprised 197 children aged 7 to 11 years living in two localities, Copsa-Mica and Axente-Sever. Exposure assessment was mainly based on blood lead, as the most specific biomarker of exposure. Lead contamination of the subjects proved a really serious situation, all of them having blood lead concentrations above 10 μg/dl, with a mean value and standard deviation of 28.12 ± 7.13 μg/dl. The prevalence of children with blood lead levels equal or higher than 20 μg/dl was very high (86.4%), especially in Copsa-Mica 93.75%). Blood lead concentrations were significantly associated with several risk factors such as parental exposure to lead at the workplace and vegetables/fruits. Comparison of blood pressures with the National Standard values revealed significant increases of diastolic blood pressure along with significant decreases of systolic blood pressure. The relationship between blood pressure and blood lead levels has been examined in a multiple linear regression model. After adjustment for locality, age, gender, parental hypertension history, height and weight, the association of distolic blood pressure with the blood lead level was statistically significant. The findings of our study reflect the necessity to develop a programme of certain technical and medical measures to reduce the lead exposure and its impact on the children's cognitive and physical development in the Copsa-Mica area. Reduction of emissions from smelter should be implemented, along with control of exposure from soil and dust that may require restriction of the children's access to soil, promotion of personal hygienic practices and dust control measures at home. Blood lead levels should be measured regularly in children, as well as indicators of its toxicity such as intelligence coefficient (IQ) and growth rates. In order to achieve these goals, a social marketing activity should be implemented.","Communication; Exposure; Health risks; Lead","lead; child development; child growth; conference paper; diastolic blood pressure; environmental exposure; female; food contamination; human; lead blood level; male; metallurgy; normal human; prevalence; risk factor; risk management; Romania; school child; workplace",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031794660

The assumed commitments would produce a substantial reduction in industrial output and employment in the US and in other participating countries.

It involves changes in land use, vegetation cover, species translocations and even the climate of the planet. The consequences for the biosphere are uncertain. Past research emphasis has been on the science of climate change as the major driver of policy. The present priority in the global-change community is to define the likely nature and extent of those impacts on biodiversity and the functioning of ecosystems. In addition, increasing consideration is now being given to adaptation measures. The way in which that is being initiated is to develop adaptation measures to respond to medium-term climate variability in the form of altered El Nino and similar cycles, and changes in the frequency of extreme events. Given the large number of stakeholders in agriculture, human health and the environment, there is a need for great efficiencies if the scientific community is going to be able to respond in a meaningful way with foreseeable resources. The plethora of problems means that generic approaches are needed. The present situation, with parasitologists each doing their own thing in terms of developing and using software tools, is like the tower of Babel. Parasitologists need common tools and languages to facilitate communication and collaboration. Advances in computing, with object-oriented programming languages and seamless exchange of information between different packages and platforms, are providing some exciting opportunities to overcome these problems.","Climate; CLIMEX; DYMEX; El Nino; Global change; Integrated impact assessment; Modelling","climate variability; disease impact; global change; impact assessment; medical geography; methodology; vector-borne disease; australia; biodiversity; computer model; conference paper; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; global climate; human; parasitosis; Adaptation, Biological; Animals; Australia; Climate; Disease Vectors; Ecosystem; Humans; Models, Biological; Parasitic Diseases; Software; Travel; World Health",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031862780

Japan's annual CO2 emissions (fiscal 1994) amounted to 343 million tons of carbon. Although CO2 emissions caused by fossil-fuel power generation accounted for 29.4% of total, on a sector basis, those directly from the energy conversion sector accounted for only 7.7%. Most CO2 emissions (21.7% of total) resulted from electric power use in the industrial, commercial and domestic sectors. Thus, the reduction of CO2 emissions caused by the use of electricity is a nationwide subject. Understanding that both supply side and demand side approaches are necessary, Kansai Electric has been deploying ""New ERA Strategy"" as a comprehensive strategy to seek a potential for CO2 reduction more broadly and deeply. Among a number of action items are the promotion of nuclear power generation, and improvement of overall energy efficiency, besides such demand side measures as leveling off the peak load. The effectiveness of action items of the New ERA Strategy was evaluated in terms of CO2 reduction. As a result, estimated CO2 reduction related to nuclear power amounted to 88% of the total for fiscal 1995 in comparison with 1990, and that expected in 2000 is 84%. These results reconfirm that nuclear power is always the key to practical CO2 reduction at present and in the future. Comparison with candidate technology alternatives revealed that photovoltaic power generation needed 7 times greater rated capacity and 280 times larger area than nuclear power, so it is not realistic as a central power station alternative. The comparison also clarified that if wind power stations were constructed at all feasible sites in the Kansai region, they would not be a viable alternative to a single nuclear unit from CO2 reduction viewpoint. © 1997 Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon dioxide; Electric power systems; Electricity; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Power generation; Wind power; Fossil fuel power generation; Nuclear power generation; Photovoltaic power generation; Wind power stations; Nuclear energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032308455

The consequence of these factors is that, in addition to the effects of long-range pollutant transport, ammonia has major effects at a local scale, with emission and receptor areas often closely located in the rural landscape. There is a substantial local spatial variability that needs to be considered in effects assessments, while variations in local deposition may affect the amount of ammonia available for impacts further afield. The wide-ranging UK programme ADEPT (Ammonia Distribution and Effects ProjecT) has addressed these issues through a combination of measurement and modelling activities concerning the distribution of emissions, atmospheric transport, deposition and effects assessment. The results are illustrated here by summarizing the findings of a joint experiment at Burrington Moor, Devon, and wider modelling contrasting the variability at a field scale with 5 km resolution estimates for the UK. The fraction of emitted NH3 deposited locally is shown to depend critically on the downwind land-cover, with fluxes being dependent on interactions with the ammonia compensation point. This will restrict deposition back to agricultural land, but may mean that non-conservation woodlands could be of benefit to recapture a significant fraction of emissions. The generalized models demonstrate the high spatial variability of ammonia impacts, with a case study being used to show the consequences at a field scale. In source regions substantial variability occurs at sub-1 km levels and this will have major consequences for the emission reduction targets needed to protect ecosystems.","Ammonia; Compensation point; Critical loads; Emission; Inventory; Mapping; Modelling","ammonia; ammonia; methodology; nitrogen oxides; pollution monitoring; spatial analysis; agriculture; atmospheric dispersion; atmospheric transport; conference paper; diagnostic approach route; environmental impact assessment; quantitative diagnosis; rural population; United Kingdom",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032442380

Pinyons growing in ash and cinder soils experienced much greater water and nutrient stress than pinyons growing nearby in sandy-loam soils. Over a one year period, we obtained monthly measurements of ECM colonization, root zone soil moisture and temperature, and air temperature and precipitation. Four major patterns emerged. Firstly, although climate as measured by ambient temperature and precipitation did not vary between the two sites, soil temperature was significantly higher and soil moisture significantly lower at the cinder site than at the sandy-loam site. Secondly, ECM colonization was significantly higher at the cinder site for 5 of 12 months. Thirdly, although nearly 70% of the variation in ECM colonization of pinyons growing in cinder soil was predicted by a combination of soil moisture and soil temperature, these same variables had little predictive power for pinyons growing in sandy-loam soils. Air temperature and precipitation were also significantly correlated with ECM colonization at the cinder site but not the sandy-loam site. Fourthly, a watering experiment showed that ECM colonization significantly increased with supplemental water at the cinder site, but not at the sandy-loam site. Thus, in two sites that did not differ in plant community or climate, ectomycorrhizas in cinder soils were far more sensitive to changes in moisture and temperature than ectomycorrhizas in sandy-loam soils.","Cinder-ash soils; Ectomycorrhizal colonization; Ectomycorrhizal fungi; Environmental stress; Temporal variation","colonization; mycorrhiza; rainfall; temperature; temporal variation; Pinus edulis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031668996

A major component of PM2.5 at locations in Illinois is secondary (NH4)2SO4 that forms from the oxidation of SO2 downwind of the emission sources. Another major component of PM2.5 in Illinois is generally unmeasured, but is likely to be mostly organic and elemental carbon. The secondary oxidation of SO2 and gas-phase organic compounds is greatest during summer, and the highest concentrations of PM2.5 also occur then. Analyses of available ambient PM2.5 in Illinois indicates that the annual standard of 15 μg m-3 would likely be exceeded in the Chicago and East St. Louis metropolitan areas. Given the preponderance of secondary material in the PM2.5, such exceedances would probably be widespread. The data indicate that the 24 h standard of 65 μg m-3 would not likely be exceeded at these locations. At rural and suburban locations statewide neither standard is likely to be exceeded, but current annual means in these locations are within about 10% of the proposed standard. Future reductions in SO2 emissions may lower PM2.5 concentrations in Illinois, barring offsetting increases in other PM2.5 components and precursors.","Compliance; Fine particles; Particulate matter; Standards","carbon; nitrate; organic compound; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; atmosphere; atmospheric pollution; oxidation; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; sulphate; sulphates; air monitoring; airborne particle; article; oxidation; priority journal; rural area; seasonal variation; standard; summer; united states; USA, Illinois; Air quality; Oxidation; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Standards; Sulfur dioxide; Airborne particulate matter; Air pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032021980

The results are used to predict the fluctuations in OH intensity and rotational temperature, Na abundance, and the centroid heights of the OH and Na layers. The OH model depends critically on the assumed form for the atomic oxygen profile. In this study the O profile is modeled as a Chapman layer, which is in excellent agreement with MSIS-90. We also neglect the wave-induce redistribution of O3 because the chemical lifetime of ozone in the mesopause region is short compared to most gravity wave periods. Under these conditions the OH response is 8DV/Vu 9A -3[1 - (z zOH)/hOH + (z - zOH)2/8s12] 8D 8r/8ru, where 8DV/Vu are the relative emission rate fluctuations, 8D 8r/8ru are the relative atmospheric density fluctuations, zOH 9A 89 km is the layer centroid height, hOH 9A 3.6 km, and 8s1 9A 8.0 km. By using these results, we show that cancellation of the induced perturbations in emission intensity and rotational temperature is significant for short verical wavelengths. The amplitude attenuation in both parameters is proportional to exp(-m2 8s 2OH/2), where m = 2 8p/8lz and 8sOH 9A 4.4 km is the rms thickness of the OH layer. For example, at 8lz = 15 km, the predicted rotational temperature perturbation is only 20% of the atmospheric temperature perturbation. Because the most sensitive instruments are only capable of accuracies approaching 9p 2 K, there are few reported observations of waves with 8lz 9V 15 km. The cancellation effects are not as limiting in OH intensity observations because the relative intensity perturbations are larger than the relative temperature perturbations, and intensities can be measured more accurately than temperature, especially with broadband instruments. Fluctuations in the emission rate are largest on the bottomside of the OH layer, 9a 3.75 km below the layer peak (9a 89 km), where the effects due to the redistribution of atomic oxygen dominate. Fluctuations in rotational temperature are largest near the peak of the OH layer, where the volume emission rate is largest. The 9a 3.75 km separation between the maxima of the intensity and rotational temperature perturbations is largely reponsible for the phase differences observed in the fluctuations of these parameters. Rotational temperature and Krassovsky's ratio are found to be very sensitive to the form of the background temperature profile. Wave-induced OH layer centroid height fluctuations coupled with the mean lapse rate of the background temperature profile can contribute significantly to the observed rotational temperature fluctuations, especially for the shorter wavelength waves 8lz 9V 15 km. The OH intensity fluctuations are relatively insensitive to the temperature profile as well as variations in atomic oxygen density and therefore appear to be excellent tracers of gravity wave dynamics. OH temperature observations are best suited for studying long-period waves, including tides, with 8lz 9V 15 km.",,"gravity waves; hydroxyl; mesosphere; sodium layer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032571199

Two pathways are considered. In the direct pathway, a reduction in cooling energy use translates into reduced demand for generation capacity and, thus, reduced precursor emissions from electric utility power plants. In the indirect pathway, reduced air temperatures can slow the atmospheric production of ozone as well as precursor emission from anthropogenic and biogenic sources. The simulations suggest small impacts on emissions following implementation of cool communities in the SoCAB. In summer, for example, there can be reductions of up to 3% in NOx emissions from in-basin power plants. The photochemical simulations suggest that the air quality impacts of these direct emission reductions are small. However, the indirect atmospheric effects of cool communities can be significant. For example, ozone peak concentrations can decrease by up to 11% in summer and population-weighted exceedance exposure to ozone above the California and National Ambient Air Quality Standards can decrease by up to 11 and 17%, respectively. The modeling suggests that if these strategies are combined with others, such as mobile-source emission control, the improvements in ozone air quality can be substantial. © 1998 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Computer simulation; Data reduction; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Photochemical simulations; Air pollution; ozone; air pollution; air quality; air temperature; control system; electric power plant; photochemistry; precursor; priority journal; review; urban area; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032168793

Eight male subjects volunteered for the study and breathed both normal air and 3% carbon dioxide with both low and high breathing resistance during moderate steady-state exercise. The high breathing resistance produced a pressure level that was almost the same as the upper permitted limit for SCBA in the JIS. Increasing the breathing resistance did not cause any significant effect on the human body while breathing normal air but, in the case of 3% carbon dioxide, the high resistance increased end-tidal carbon dioxide significantly and caused strong distress in the test subjects. Based on these results, it is recommended that carbon dioxide levels be kept low to improve human performance while wearing SCBAs.","Breathing resistance; Carbon dioxide; Japan Industrial Standard (JIS); Self-contained self-rescuer","carbon dioxide; oxygen; adult; airway pressure; airway resistance; article; breathing; breathing apparatus; breathing rate; controlled study; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; exercise; human; human experiment; Japan; male; steady state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031828129

Increment cores were collected at breast height from white pine, red oak, and American beech from the study woodlot on Cornwall Island and at a control site in Long Sault Provincial Park. Tree-rings were analyzed for eight elements (fluorine, aluminum, manganese, magnesium, calcium, sodium, chlorine and potassium) and some major organic compounds (total extractives, lignin and holocellulose). All three species from the study woodlot showed significant chemical compositional changes during the peak pollution and post-abatement periods. There was a substantial increase of the levels of total extractives (up to 167%), lignin (up to 38%), fluorine, aluminum and manganese and a significant decrease of holocellulose content (up to 17%) in the stem tissues during the period of HF exposure, compared to the pre-pollution period. In contrast, trees from the control site showed no significant change in chemical composition in any of the three periods. Lower cellulose and higher lignin and extractives concentrations potentially makes the wood weaker and less suitable for dimension lumber and pulping.","Extractives; Holocellulose; Hydrogen fluoride; Lignin; Trace elements",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031898816

It was established that the disorder is manifested by broadening (smearing) of the nonequatorial reflections having 0kl indices and a decrease in their integral intensity. The smearing of the reflections is most pronounced in the first stage of disordering, where the longitudinal shifts of the chain segments possess a correlated character and lead to deviations of the (0kl) planes. The second stage of disordering, related to the loss of correlation in the longitudinal motions of neighboring chains, is accompanied predominantly by a loss of the reflection intensity. An expression is obtained for the Fourier coefficients of the 00l type reflection intensity distribution along the layer planes in the reciprocal space, which allows the mutual displacements of the neighboring chains in the longitudinal direction to be determined in the first stage of disordering. In addition, a relation is derived that determines the magnitude of independent chain displacements in the second stage of disordering, A method, called the ω-2θ scanning, is proposed for recording the X-ray diffraction intensity distribution along the layer planes, which provides convenient experimental intensity profiles for the Fourier analysis. The experimental results reported previously for the longitudinal disorder in PTFE and polycarbonate crystallites during a transition to the mesomorphous state are analyzed from the standpoint of new concepts. The structural methods proposed are applied to the study of disordering in crystallites of an equimolar copolymer of tetrafluoroethylene and ethylene. It is demonstrated that similar to the case of PTFE and polycarbonate, the passage from the first to second stage of longitudinal disordering in the copolymer crystallites is observed in the region of a high-temperature α0 transition featuring a sharp decrease in the strength of interchain interactions.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032220801

Various ceramic materials (alumina, silicon carbide and calcium carbonate) were examined in order to establish a general relationship among solid loading of the starting suspension, particle packing in green state and drying behaviour. The Bigot's curves indicated that the shrinkage decreases with increasing solids' concentration, whereas the critical moisture content (CMC) shows an initial decrease followed by a trend towards a constant value at higher solid loading. The slope of the straight lines corresponding to the first stage of drying first increases with augmenting solid concentration, but decreases again for high solid loading. For all materials tested, good relationships were found between the CMC and slip cast density (correlation coefficients higher than 0·98) as well as between the shrinkage during the first stage of the drying process and solid loading (correlation coefficients higher than 0·99). Finally, Bigot's curves revealed to be a very simple yet effective tool to characterise the porous microstructure of slip cast bodies. In contrast, evaluation of the pore size distribution in relative dense slip cast bodies by Hg-porosimetry was found to be a less reliable method. © 1998 Elsevier Science Limited.

This precipitation commonly falls on areas that are distant from the basin; evaporative losses in the desert climate are substantially reduced when runoff is concentrated in channels or when it infiltrates to the groundwater system and is delivered (long after the precipitation event) to a closed basin. Mountain glaciers may both dam desert drainage systems and provide meltwater, and continental ice sheets are known to have impounded vast areas of water in arid regions during the Pleistocene. Increased aridity may actually lead to the formation of freshwater lakes in arid regions through basin deflation, mammal excavation, dune impoundment, reorganization of stratified groundwater systems, and changes in lake surface area/volume ratios. Importantly, that part of the sedimentary and biological record that was deposited during the drying phase of a desert lake - which is one of the most important proxies for establishing an arid paleoclimate - may be missing. This absence may be the result of removal by re-solution or deflation, or be related to the fact that life in highly saline lakes consists mainly of soft-bodied microorganisms that are easily destroyed during subsequent oxidation of the sediments. Thus, the record of a lake basin in an arid region may only leave a history of its fresh and brackish water phases, and this may suggest that the regional climate was relatively wet, even over long periods.

Methods - Ecological study with time series data and application of Poisson regression. Associations between number of daily emergency visits in a city's hospital and concentrations of air pollutants were analysed taking into account potential confounding factors by the standardised protocol of the air pollution and health: a European approach (APHEA) project. Results - Mean (range) daily number of emergency room visits for asthma was 1 (0-5). Concentrations of all pollutants studied remained within current air quality standards. The association between an increase of 10 μg/m3 in ambient air pollution and asthma, measured as a relative risk (RR) of emergency visits, was significant for NO2 24 hour mean lag 0, RR 1.076, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 1.020 to 1.134), NO2 hour maximum (lag 0, RR 1.037, 95% CI 1.008 to 1.066), and O3 hour maximum (lag 1, RR 1.063, CI 95% 1.014 to 1.114). The association was not significant for SO2 or for black smoke during the period analysed. The effects were not significantly different for the time of year, cold months (November to April), or warm months (May to October).

The ideal fuel would eliminate local air pollution, substantially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and oil imports, cost no more than current transportation fuels per mile driven, and require little investment in new infrastructure. In addition, the fuel used for future fuel cell vehicles should be suitable for near-term hybrid electric vehicles using internal combustion engines, to avoid the need for introducing more than one new motor fuel in the 21st century. All three primary FCV fuels have limitations: gasoline is the most difficult to reform to produce hydrogen and produces the least improvement in the environment and yields the least oil import reductions. Methanol is cleaner, easier to reform onboard the FCV, eliminates oil imports, but requires some new infrastructure. Hydrogen provides the best environmental and oil import improvements, but requires the largest infrastructure investment. This paper will provide a comprehensive comparison of FCV fuels and their societal impact on local air pollution, greenhouse gases and oil imports. In addition, we will estimate the likely infrastructure costs for each fuel, and compare their societal impact if used as a fuel for hybrid electric vehicles. © 1998 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Air pollution; Automotive fuels; Cost benefit analysis; Economic and social effects; Fuel cells; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen production; Internal combustion engines; Investments; Methanol; Petroleum transportation; Comprehensive comparisons; Fuel cell vehicles; Infrastructure costs; Infrastructure investment; Local air pollutions; Primary fuels; Societal impacts; Transportation fuels; Hybrid vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072468992

In addition to natural climatic change, climatic changes may occur in the near future due to increased concentrations of carbon dioxide and other trace gases in the atmosphere that are the result of human activities. International research efforts using atmospheric general circulation models (AGCM's) to assess potential climatic conditions under atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations of twice the pre-industrial level (a ""2xCO2"" atmosphere) conclude that climate would warm on a global basis. However, it is difficult to assess how the projected warmer climatic conditions would be distributed on a regional scale and what the effects of such warming would be on the landscape, especially for temperate mountainous regions such as the Western United States. In this report, we present a strategy to assess the regional sensitivity to global climatic change. The strategy makes use of a hierarchy of models ranging from an AGCM, to a regional climate model, to landscape-scale process models of hydrology and vegetation. A 2xCO2 global climate simulation conducted with the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) GENESIS AGCM on a grid of approximately 4.5° of latitude by 7.5° of longitude was used to drive the NCAR regional climate model (RegCM) over the Western United States on a grid of 60 km by 60 km. The output from the RegCM is used directly (for hydrologic models) or interpolated onto a 15-km grid (for vegetation models) to quantify possible future environmental conditions on a spatial scale relevant to policy makers and land managers.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0003334220

There are four major controls on the occurrence of these landslides: structure, climate, topography and erosion. The tectonic control is though the structure and lithology of phyllites and mica-schists with strong lineations providing preferred seepage and failure planes. Climate controls the long-term, seasonal and short-term water-pressure heads. Topography controls the localised head-pressure gradients as a result of seepage and erosion controls the incidence of slope undercutting by fluvial action. The effects of these controls are tested using a hydrological budget model for percolation to ground water, a finite-element model for ground water flows and stability analysis for modelling the actual failures. The results suggest that in this mountainous terrain while climate may be very important for shallow failures, the erosional history and the consequent morphology are in general much more important except for the trimming induced by occasional very large run-off events.",,"landslide; mass movement; mountain region; Mediterranean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032122441

The forests account for about 10 per cent of the world's terrestrial primary productivity and for a similar fraction of the carbon stored in land ecosystems, and short-term field measurements suggest that these ecosystems are globally important carbon sinks. But tropical land ecosystems have experienced substantial interannual climate variability owing to frequent El Nino episodes in recent decades. Of particular importance to climate change policy is how such climate variations, coupled with increases in atmospheric CO2 concentration, affect terrestrial carbon storage. Previous model analyses have demonstrated the importance of temperature in controlling carbon storage. Here we use a transient process-based biogeochemical model of terrestrial ecosystems to investigate interannual variations of carbon storage in undisturbed Amazonian ecosystems in response to climate variability and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentration during the period 1980 to 1994. In El Nino years, which bring hot, dry weather to much of the Amazon region, the ecosystems act as a source of carbon to the atmosphere (up to 0.2 petagrams of carbon in 1987 and 1992). In other years, these ecosystems act as a carbon sink (up to 0.7 Pg C in 1981 and 1993). These fluxes are large; they compare to a 0.3 Pg C per year source to the atmosphere associated with deforestation in the Amazon Basin in the early 1990s. Soil moisture, which is affected by both precipitation and temperature, and which affects both plant and soil processes, appears to be an important control on carbon storage.",,"carbon sequestration; temporal variation; tropical environment; article; carbon dioxide fixation; climate; ecosystem; forest; greenhouse effect; land use; priority journal; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032542301

This feature has been explained by the formation of more isolated carbonyl groups in the case of this sample, which would result from a deeper penetration of active species created by the plasma discharge, or a larger fraction of amorphous regions associated with a larger proportion of oxygen in the bulk.

However, international agreement on a conversion factor for tC.years per tC emission and the time limit for crediting the effect of a given project will be required. (2) The development of forest sector greenhouse gas bubbles may be required to establish a credible and equitable supply of carbon offsets in countries without binding national limits on emissions.

The data were extracted from both single decay curves and time-resolved emission spectra and analyzed by the exponential series method. The results strongly suggest the existence of a tri-modal decay time distribution with peak decay time values centred around 0.7, 3 and 10 ns. The relative amplitudes of the decay time distributions were shown to depend on the emission wavelength, indicating a three-species mixture with slightly different emission maxima and widths. As sustained by time-resolved emission spectra the same species of fluorophores are responsible for the fluorescence kinetics behaviour of fulvic acid at all excitation wavelengths used in the experiments. For the first time these techniques and methods were applied in investigating the effects of the Eu3+ complexation upon fluorescence kinetics of the fulvic acid. Single decay analysis indicates that the peak decay time values are not affected by Eu3+ addition at all emission and excitation wavelengths used in the experiments. On the contrary, the dependency of relative amplitudes on emission wavelength was greatly reduced in comparison with the uncomplexed fulvic acid. This effect is further evidenced by analysing the barycenter transients of time-resolved emission spectra. Finally, it is also indicated that within the temporal resolution of the experimental set up used the singlet states play no role as donor states in intramolecular energy transfer from the organic fulvic acid ligands to the Eu3+ energy levels.","Europium ion; Fulvic acid; Time-resolved fluorescence",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001408042

More specifically, scholars often hold that the development of foundations in Germany is largely hampered by an administrative and regulatory climate that weakens rather than strengthens the foundation community. Two main arguments are brought forth in this context: First, the expansion of the state bureaucracy into traditional activity fields of foundations ""crowds out"" the foundation sector; second, the structure of tax regulations is detrimental to a ""sound"" development of foundations. However, while these arguments figure prominently in the policy debate, they have neither empirically nor analytically been substantiated as of yet. Borrowing from organizational theory, this article critically evaluates the arguments in the light of available evidence in an effort to contribute to a better understanding of foundations in an international context.","Crowding out; Foundations; Germany; Legal regulation and incentives; Role of foundations; United States",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342580825

We compared two indigenous Quercus species, Q. ilex and Q. pubescens, growing in a natural CO2 spring located in central Italy and at a nearby control site. In May, 1995 photosynthetic rate at least doubled when measured with supplemental CO2 in both species and sites. Dark respiration was much higher at the CO2 spring site in both species. Foliar sugar and starch concentrations in Q. ilex exhibited significant site and diurnal differences (May and September). In July, 1995 there was little difference in the water potential values of the measured trees at the different sites over the diurnal period. Photosynthetic rate was higher for both species in the CO2 spring, particularly in the early morning and late afternoon. Mid-day stomatal closure reduced photosynthesis to similar levels. In the morning leaf conductance and transpiration were generally lower in the CO2 spring trees, contributing to higher instantaneous water use efficiency for both species. Isoprene emission rates were higher in Q. pubescens trees growing in the CO2 spring. The maximum difference between control and CO2 spring trees occurred in late afternoon. In contrast, Q. ilex exhibited isoprene emission near background level. Foliage and branch carbon and nitrogen status showed increased concentrations of starch and tannins in Q. ilex and of soluble sugars in Q. pubescens in the elevated CO2 environment, while nitrogen concentration decreased in both species. Wood gravity increased 6 and 3% in Q. ilex and Q. pubescens, respectively, growing in the CO2 spring. Q. ilex exhibited afternoon recovery of water potential compared to Q. pubescens which had better night-time recovery. Q. ilex and Q. pubescens exposed to elevated CO2 for prolonged periods exhibit different mechanisms for dealing with additional reduced carbon and do maintain an altered carbon physiology, even in midst of the region's characteristic summer drought.","Elevated CO2; Gas exchange; Natural CO2 springs; Quercus; Secondary compounds","adaptation; carbon dioxide; dark respiration; diurnal period; emission; foliar metabolism; isoprene; italy; photosynthesis; starch; stomatal closure; sugar; transpiration; Quercus ilex; Quercus pubescens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031852540

Among these technologies, carbon dioxide (CO2) flooding is a highly attractive possibility. At the same time, a large amount of CO2 is being produced by coal-fired power plants in this region. The CO2 is currently discharged into the atmosphere and could be a major contributor to the so-called greenhouse effect, which would lead to global warming. Thus, the concept of capturing CO2 and utilizing it as a flooding agent in EOR processes is currently generating much interest among oil, utility and coal companies. This paper describes how cogeneration concepts, together with process optimization strategies, help to reduce the CO2 production cost by utilizing low-pressure steam and waste heat from various sections of the power generation process. Based on these concepts and strategies, results from this study show that the recovery cost of CO2 from a coal-fired power plant can range between $0.50 - 2.00/mscf. If the cost is approximately $1.25/mscf, the production cost of a barrel of incremental oil would be less than $18. Therefore, at modest oil prices, there is room for profit to be made operating a CO2 flood with flue gas extracted CO2. The technical and economic feasibility of the concepts are evaluated and practical implications for the Saskatchewan resources are discussed.",,"Coalfired power stations; Economic feasibility study; Carbon dioxide; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Oil well flooding; Enhanced recovery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032202986

Although soil microorganisms are affected by topography and grazing, little is known about how these two variables may interact to influence microbial processes. Even less is known about how these variables influence microorganisms in systems that contain large populations of free-roaming ungulates. In this study, we compared microbial biomass size and activity, as measured by in situ net N mineralization, inside and outside 35- to 40-year exclosures across a topographic gradient in northern Yellowstone National Park. The objective was to determine the relative effect of topography and large grazers on microbial biomass and nitrogen mineralization. Microbial C and N varied by almost an order of magnitude across sites. Topographic depressions that contained high plant biomass and fine-textured soils supported the greatest microbial biomass. We found that plant biomass accurately predicted microbial biomass across our sites suggesting that carbon inputs from plants constrained microbial biomass. Chronic grazing neither depleted soil C nor reduced microbial biomass. We hypothesize that microbial populations in grazed grasslands are sustained mainly by inputs of labile C from dung deposition and increased root turnover or root exudation beneath grazed plants. Mineral N fluxes were affected more by grazing than topography. Net N mineralization rates were highest in grazed grassland and increased from dry, unproductive to mesic, highly productive communities. Overall, our results indicate that topography mainly influences microbial biomass size, while mineral N fluxes (microbial activity) are affected more by grazing in this grassland ecosystem.","Grazing; Microorganisms; Nitrogen mineralization; Topography; Yellowstone","grassland; herbivory; microbial biomass; mineralization; mirobial biomass; nitrogen; soil microorganism; USA, Wyoming, Yellowstone National Park",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031839109

The review encompasses observations, empirical studies, theory and modeling of the extratropical teleconnections with a focus on developments over the Tropical Oceans-Global Atmosphere (TOGA) decade and the current state of understanding. In the tropical atmosphere, anomalous SST force anomalies in convection and large-scale overturing with subsidence in the descending branch of the local Hadley circulation. The resulting strong upper tropospheric divergence in the tropics and convergence in the subtropics act as a Rossby wave source. The climatological stationary planetary waves and associated jet streams, especially in the northern hemisphere, can make the total Rossby wave sources somewhat insensitive to the position of the tropical heating that induces them and thus can create preferred teleconnection response patterns, such as the Pacific-North American (PNA) pattern. However, a number of factors influence the dispersion and propagation of Rossby waves through the atmosphere, including zonal asymmetries in the climatological state, transients, and baroclinic and nonlinear effects. Internal midlatitude sources can amplify perturbations. Observations, modeling, and theory have clearly shown how storm tracks change in response to changes in quasi-stationary waves and how these changes generally feedback to maintain or strengthen the dominant perturbations through vorticity and momentum transports. The response of the extratropical atmosphere naturally induces changes in the underlying surface, so that there are changes in extratropical SSTs and changes in land surface hydrology and moisture availability that can feedback and influence the total response. Land surface processes are believed to be especially important in spring and summer. Anomalous SSTs and tropical forcing have tended to be strongest in the northern winter, and teleconnections in the southern hemisphere are weaker and more variable and thus more inclined to be masked by natural variability. Occasional strong forcing in seasons other than winter can produce strong and identifiable signals in the northern hemisphere and, because the noise of natural variability is less, the signal-to-noise ratio can be large. The relative importance of tropical versus extratropical SST forcings has been established through numerical experiments with atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). Predictability of anomalous circulation and associated surface temperature and precipitation in the extratropics is somewhat limited by the difficulty of finding a modest signal embedded in the high level of noise from natural variability in the extratropics, and the complexity and variety of the possible feedbacks. Accordingly, ensembles of AGCM runs and time averaging are needed to identify signals and make predictions. Strong anomalous tropical forcing provides opportunities for skillful forecasts, and the accuracy and usefulness of forecasts is expected to improve as the ability to forecast the anomalous SSTs improves, as models improve, and as the information available from the mean and the spread of ensemble forecasts is better utilized.",,"atmosphere-ocean coupling; sea surface temperature; teleconnection; TOGA",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032577959

Many countries are hard-pressed to protect their coastal resources against present-day hazards, let alone any increased threat in the future. Moreover, the threat posed by climate change is uncertain making the increased costs of protection difficult to justify. Here, we examine one management strategy, based on the rehabilitation of the mangrove ecosystem, which may provide a dual, 'winwin' benefit in improving the livelihood of local resource users as well as enhancing sea defences. The strategy, therefore, represents a precautionary approach to climate impact mitigation. This paper quantifies the economic benefits of mangrove rehabilitation undertaken, inter alia, to enhance sea defence systems in three coastal Districts of northern Vietnam. The results of the analysis show that mangrove rehabilitation can be desirable from an economic perspective based solely on the direct use benefits by local communities. Such activities have even higher benefit cost ratios with the inclusion of the indirect benefits resulting from the avoided maintenance cost for the sea dike system which the mangrove stands protect from coastal storm surges.",,"climate change; coastal zone management; mangrove; remediation; resource management; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032047259

Laboratory experiments have shown that some surfactants generate `smart' foam that selectively reduces mobility of CO2 by a greater fraction in higher than in lower permeability cores. The occurrence of such an exciting property in foam displacement and its application to improving oil recovery in heterogeneous porous media are discussed in this paper. In our latest work that experimentally simulated the heterogeneous characteristic of reservoirs, we used composite cores that contain coaxial zones of high and low permeability either in capillary contact or isolated from each other. Experiments were performed on core systems both with and without oil saturation. Smart foam was injected into these core systems and its performance was determined by the breakthrough time of CO2 and fluid recovery in each well-defined permeability region. Our results demonstrate that smart foam is useful in correcting nonuniform frontal displacement due to the heterogeneity of a reservoir formation. Smart foam is also very effective in displacing the oil - a benefit frequently overlooked by researchers testing the foam aspects of mobility control.",,"Brines; Carbon dioxide; Core analysis; Crude petroleum; Enhanced recovery; Foams; Mechanical permeability; Porous materials; Saturation (materials composition); Surface active agents; Smart foams; Petroleum reservoir evaluation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031653865

OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the respiratory functions of children from three schools situated at a different distance from the major sources of air pollution--an asbestos-cement plant, a fertilizer plant and a steam-power plant which utilize brown coal as a main source of energy. METHODS: Comprehensive functional investigation of breathing (FIB) was performed on 97 children from the town of Dimitrovgrad--mean age 10.4 +/- 0.1 years and height 145 +/- 0.6 cm (mean +/- Sx) in a special university medical center laboratory. The characterization of the degree of air pollution was based on the analysis of the mean yearly concentrations of particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, ammonia and hydrogen sulphide in the three zones of exposure in the town on the basis of the criteria outlined in the Uniform National System for Control of Air Pollution in Bulgaria. RESULTS: The mean yearly concentrations of particulate matter up to 0.19 mg/m3, of hydrogen sulphide--up to 0.07 mg/m3, of nitrogen dioxide--up to 0.025 mg/m3, of ammonia--up to 0.16 mg/m3, of hydrogen sulphide--up to 0.13 mg/m3 and lead aerosols--up to 0.00012 mg/m3 recorded at the different stations reached statistical significance at some of them. No significant differences were found in the values of lung function parameters of the healthy children from all three zones. MEF50% (94 +/- 2%) and the Single Breath Transfer Factor (TLCO = 93 +/- 1.5%) showed a tendency towards lower values.

We collected extensive driving cycle data and proposed a methodology to develop a Taipei motorcycle driving cycle (TMDC). The characteristics of TMDC are high average acceleration and deceleration, high acceleration - deceleration changes and low average travel speed. Forty-five motorcycles were tested in a laboratory by using the ECE-40 and TMDC test procedure. The emissions of motorcycles tested by TMDC are higher than ECE, whether they are two-stroke or four-stroke engines. Furthermore, the CO and HC emissions of two-stroke engine motorcycles are higher than four-stroke engine motorcycles, and the NOx emission of two-stroke engine motorcycles are lower than four-stroke engine motorcycles, whether they are tested by TMDC or ECE. The fuel economy of two-stroke engine motorcycles tested by TMDC is lower than ECE, but the fuel economy of four-stroke engine motorcycles tested by TMDC is higher than ECE. A linear regression of TMDC in terms of ECE emissions shows them to be highly correlated, as is fuel economy. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Measurements in the upper Humber during March 1995 showed DO in the range 82% to 87% of saturation. Suspended particulate matter concentrations were &lt;5000 mg l-1 and salinity was in the range 0.5 to 12. In contrast, a pronounced DO sag occurred in the upper reaches of the Ouse during medium and spring tide, summer conditions. The DO minimum was essentially an anoxic level and was associated with the location of the turbidity maximum, at salinities between about 0.4 and 1.5. SPM concentrations at 1 m beneath the surface reached 25,000 mg l-1 in the turbidity maximum, between about 20 km and 40 km from the tidal limit. Suspended particulate matter concentrations were much lower at neap tides, although dense suspensions of SPM (&gt;60,000 mg l-1) occurred within 1 m of the bed in the turbidity maximum region. A spring-neap record showed a dramatic and tidally controlled decrease in DO at very low salinities as the tides progressed from neaps to springs. An anchor station located down-channel of the turbidity maximum showed that about 95% of the variance in DO, which varied from 28% at low-water slack to 67% at high-water slack, could be explained in terms of salinity variation. At the up-channel margins of the turbidity maximum, DO increased from zero (anoxia) near high water to 60% near low water slack, in contrast to the behavior down-channel of the turbidity maximum. About 82% of the variance in DO could be explained in terms of salinity variations alone. Only 43% of the DO variance could be explained in terms of SPM alone. Up-channel of the turbidity maximum, SPM concentrations were relatively low (&lt;3000 mg l-1) and DO levels varied from 48% of saturation near high water to 83% near low water slack. About 76% of the variance in DO could be explained in terms of salinity variations alone. Within the turbidity maximum region, DO varied from &lt;2% saturation on the early flood and late ebb and maximized around 7% at high water slack. About 63% of the variance in DO could be explained in terms of salinity variation alone. This increased to 70% when suspended particulate matter was taken into account. Only 29% of the DO variance could be explained in terms of suspended particulate matter alone. Because bacteria were likely to have been the cause of the observed reduction in DO, the numbers of bacteria, both free-living and attached to particles, were measured in the turbidity maximum region. Numbers of free-living bacteria were low and most of the bacteria were attached to sediment particles. There was a linear correlation between total bacterial number and suspended particulate matter concentration, suggesting that the strong DO demand was exerted locally as a result of bacterial activity associated with increased suspended particulate matter concentrations. An order of magnitude analysis of DO consumption within the Ouse's turbidity maximum, based on the premise that DO depletion was directly related to suspended particulate matter concentrations and that DO addition was due to reaeration, indicates that complete deoxygenation could have occurred with an oxygen depletion rate of ~0.01 mg DO h-1/g suspended particulate matter during the residence time of waters within the turbidity maximum (~7 d). This rate was sufficiently fast that anoxic to aerobic conditions were able to develop a spring-neap periodicity within the turbidity maximum, but too slow to generate substantial intratidal fluctuations in DO. This is in accordance with the observations, which show that relatively little of the intratidal variance in DO could be explained in terms of suspended particulate matter fluctuations, whereas most of the variance could be explained in terms of salinity, which behaved as a surrogate measure for the proximity of the turbidity maximum.",,"dissolved oxygen; estuarine chemistry; microbial activity; suspended particulate matter; turbidity; England; Humber Estuary; United Kingdom; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032467298

Using the computer steered 'end-tidal forcing system', 2 min of steady state ventilation were followed by a step increase in PE'(CO2) (1-1.5 kPa). This level was maintained for 8 min, followed by a step decrease to the original value for another 8 min. Each hypercapnic response was separated into a fast, peripheral component and a slow, central component, characterized by a time constant, carbon dioxide sensitivity, time delay and off-set. We studied 25 healthy volunteers; they performed 2-3 studies without and 2-3 studies during inhalation of the anaesthetic agent. Level of sedation was scored using a subjective seven-point scale from 0 (= alert and awake) to 6 (unrousable). In the isoflurane (16 subjects, 33 control, 37 drug studies) and sevoflurane (15 subjects, 40 control, 41 drug studies) studies, peripheral carbon dioxide sensitivity was reduced by approximately 45% and approximately 27% (ANOVA, P &lt; 0.05 vs control), respectively, without affecting central carbon dioxide sensitivity or apnoeic threshold. In the desflurane study (16 subjects, 36 control, 37 drug studies), no significant effect was observed for any of the variables measured. A significant relation was observed between sedation score and change from control in central carbon dioxide sensitivities in the isoflurane and desflurane studies and in the change in the ratio peripheral carbon dioxide sensitivity over total carbon dioxide sensitivity in the sevoflurane studies. At the highest level of sedation observed (score 3 - arousal state comparable with 'light sleep' - in three subjects) these latter variables differed significantly from those in the other observed sedation levels (scores 1 and 2 - a state of drowsiness). We conclude that 0.1 MAC of isoflurane and sevoflurane depressed the peripheral chemoreflex loop, without affecting the central chemoreflex loop. Desflurane at the same MAC showed no effect on peripheral and central carbon dioxide sensitivity. When the level of sedation was considered, our data suggested that at levels of sedation comparable with sleep, a depressive effect of all three anaesthetics was observed on the central chemoreflex loop.","Anaesthetics volatile, desflurane; Anaesthetics volatile, isoflurane; Anaesthetics volatile, sevoflurane; Hypoxaemia; Ventilation, hypoxic response","carbon dioxide; desflurane; isoflurane; sevoflurane; adult; apnea; arousal; article; breathing mechanics; chemoreceptor reflex; clinical trial; computer; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; drowsiness; female; human; human experiment; hypercapnia; inhalational drug administration; male; minimum lung alveolus concentration; normal human; priority journal; respiration control; sedation; sleep; steady state",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031915207

Obviously, the ammonia concentrations are higher close to the source, but at this short distance vegetation has no special value in terms of nature conservation, as it mostly consists of ammonia-resistant agricultural crops. However, three crop categories include relatively sensitive species (fruity culture, glasshouse crops and arboriculture). This paper presents an estimation of the risk of ammonia damage to sensitive crops as related to the distance to the source, based on the mean and variation in emission, dispersion, regional background concentration, landscape characteristics and plant sensitivity. Some attention is paid to damage of natural vegetation and to risk-reducing measures (elevation of emission point, wind fence around the source). The goal is to provide information for regional and local officials and farmers who are dealing with risk evaluation, claims for damages, and environmental policy matters like stable reallocations etc.","Ammonia; Atmospheric dispersion; Plant damage; Risk evaluation","ammonia; ammonia; crop damage; emission control; nitrogen oxides; agriculture; atmospheric dispersion; conference paper; crop; environmental protection; landscaping; nonhuman; policy; risk assessment; vegetation; Netherlands; Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032433358

The lifetime of P+. is determined by measuring the decay of the EPR signals following relaxation of the initial spin polarization. All samples except one of the RC fractions show evidence of light induced charge separation and formation of chlorophyll triplet states. The lifetime of P+. is found to be biexponential with components of 1.5 ms and 30 ms for C. tepidum and 1.0 and 4.5 ms for Hc. mobilis at 100 K. In both cases, the rates are assigned to recombination from F-(X). The spin polarized radical pair spectra for both species are similar and those from Hc. mobilis at room temperature and 100 K are identical. In all cases, an emission/absorption polarization pattern with a net absorption is observed. A slight narrowing of the spectra and a larger absorptive net polarization is found at K-band. No out-of-phase echo modulation is observed. Taken together, the recombination kinetics, the frequency dependence of the spin polarization and the absence of an out-of-phase echo signal lead to the assignment of the spectra to the contribution from P+. to the state P+.F-(X). The origin of the net polarization and its frequency dependence are discussed in terms of singlet-triplet mixing in the precursor. It is shown that the field-dependent polarization expected to develop during the 600-700 ps lifetime of P+.A-.0 is in qualitative agreement with the observed spectra. The identity that the acceptor preceding F(X) and the conflicting evidence from EPR, optical methods and chemical analyses of the samples are discussed.

The Electricity Supply Industry has serious reservations about the strategy. This will be discussed together with a case study for the Netherlands. It will be shown that RAINS is not an appropriate tool for quantitative allocation of emission reduction goals to the Member States of the European Community. A strategy is preferred that proceeds by successive stages, accompanied by monitoring of the environmental improvements.

We show how the maintained consensus about the quantitative estimate of a central scientific concept in the anthropogenic climate-change field - namely, climate sensitivity -operates as an 'anchoring device' in 'science for policy'. In international assessments of the climate issue, the consensus-estimate of 1.5°C to 4.5°C for climate sensitivity has remained unchanged for two decades. Nevertheless, during these years climate scientific knowledge and analysis have changed dramatically. We identify several ways in which the scientists achieved flexibility in maintaining the same numbers for climate sensitivity while accommodating changing scientific ideas. We propose that the remarkable quantitative stability of the climate sensitivity range has helped to hold together a variety of different social worlds relating to climate change, by continually translating and adapting the meaning of the 'stable' range. But this emergent stability also reflects an implicit social contract among the various scientists and policy specialists involved, which allows 'the same' concept to accommodate tacitly different local meanings. Thus the very multidimensionality of such scientific concepts is part of their technical imprecision (which is more than just analytical lack of resolution); it is also the source of their resilience and value in bridging (and perhaps reorganizing) the differentiated social worlds typical of modern policy issues. The varying importance of particular dimensions of knowledge for different social groups may allow cohesion to be sustained amidst pluralism, and universality to coexist with cultural distinctiveness.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032368111

In the Netherlands 70% of the nitrogen losses occur in agriculture; mainly (70%) in soil and groundwater. Where measurements on emissions to the different environmental media are laborious and costly, calculations are made with models or statistics. This paper describes two methods to determine the total nitrogen surpluses from agriculture using statistical information: the farmgate and the soil surface method. Surpluses are defined as the difference between the nitrogen inputs into and outputs from the agricultural system. The methods described are used to monitor the effectiveness of nitrogen reduction measures taken on account of the EU Nitrate Directive and the OSPARCOM agreements. The methods of calculation described here are also used by OECD and EUROSTAT to compute indicators of nutrient use. Results from the Netherlands over a ten-year period indicate that so far little progress has been made in reducing nitrogen surpluses. Ammonia emissions have been reduced at the expense of an increased loss of nitrogen to the soil. Estimating nitrogen surpluses calculated as the difference between the inputs of nitrogen to the soil and the withdrawal by crops (soil surface method) requires consistent data on the feed-animal-manure balance. When comparing data on agricultural surpluses between different countries this consistency is a major concern.","Agriculture; Balance sheets; Nitrogen; Statistics; Validation","agricultural emission; ammonia; methodology; nitrogen; pollution monitoring; agriculture; conference paper; environmental impact assessment; nitrogen balance; pollution; statistical analysis; Netherlands; Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032417539

Under conditions of relatively high light intensity and low CO2 availability, the pH of the apoplast and unstirred layer becomes acid at one side of the leaf and alkaline at the other. In the acid region, bicarbonate is converted into CO2, which diffuses into the leaf where it is fixed. Previous experiments on the light-dependent reduction of extracellular electron acceptors led to the hypothesis of redox regulation. Under conditions of high light and low CO2, excess reducing power in the chloroplast was supposed to be shuttled to the cytoplasm where it can upregulate the plasma membrane proton pump, leading to activation of polarity. Chlorophyll a fluorescence is an indicator for photosynthetic electron transport, the energization of thylakoids, and the reoxidation of chloroplast NADPH. It was used therefore to test redox regulation in vivo in Potamogeton lucens L. leaves. The fluoresence parameter, q(p), an indicator for photochemical quenching and NADPH reoxidation, appeared to be rather insensitive to the inorganic carbon concentration and to the presence or absence of polarity.

The panel operation is based on controlled electron (`hop') transport in vacuum through insulating structures, enabling the use of mechanical supports inside the envelope to withstand the atmospheric pressure. The resulting flat panel has a thickness of about 1 cm for any panel size, a relatively low mass, and a reduced number of outside connections. The `hop'-transport process is based on a self-regulating secondary-emission process. This process involves charge deposition by electrons landing on insulating surfaces. These modify the potential distribution until a steady state is reached in which exactly one electron leaves the surface for each electron impinging on the insulator. This process is used throughout the panel to guide the electrons from the cathodes to the addressed dots at the phosphor screen. The techniques and the processes used for making the panels are described. These include a refined powder-blast process for three-dimensional structuring of thin glass plates, a wet-chemical process for realizing metal tracks on glass plates, and a low-cost process for depositing thin MgO layers. System aspects concerning the application of the flat panel in TV sets are discussed, and some of the electronic circuitry, including newly developed ICs needed for driving the panel, is described. A two-step addressing system allows the implementation of a novel multiplexing scheme, which leads to a more than three-fold reduction in the number of outside connections. Experimental 17-in. panels show good performance in terms of luminance, contrast, color purity, luminous efficacy, and viewing angle. Picture-uniformity aspects deserve further investigation, but already some good results have been obtained. The same can be said for the lifetime of the panel.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Cathodes; Deposition; Electrons; Flat panel displays; Image analysis; Image quality; Integrated circuit layout; Magnesia; Phosphors; Secondary emission; Flat cathode ray tubes (CRT); Thin cathode ray tubes (CRT); Cathode ray tubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032274526

For ground-state Ti+ reacting with propane, dehydrogenation and demethanation both occur at thermal energy with reaction efficiencies of 17% and less than 1%, respectively. For ground-state V+, dehydrogenation occurs at thermal energy with an efficiency of less than 1% whereas demethanation occurs with a 0.70 ± 0.06 eV threshold. Deuterium-labeling studies indicate that β-H(D) transfer to form the metal ethene dihydride complex or a multicenter elimination of H2 is the rate-limiting step for dehydrogenation, while reductive elimination of methane is shown to be rate limiting for demethanation. The product kinetic energy release distributions (KERDs) for H2 loss from Ti+(C3H8) and V+(C3H8) are both statistical. Modeling the experimental KERDs using statistical phase space theory yields D0°(Ti+- C3H6) = 34.5 ± 3 kcal/mol and D0°(V+-C3H6) = 30.7 ± 2 kcal/mol. To explain differences in the reactivity of Ti+ and V+, the potential energy surfaces of the reactions are discussed in some detail with an emphasis on the importance of spin-orbit-coupled crossings between surfaces of different spin.",,"carbon; deuterium; ethylene; methane; propane; titanium; article; chemical reaction; energy; hydrogenation; model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032540652

The fraction of the earth's surface covered by each vegetation type according to BATS is obtained for each latitude belt. In the control experiment, the mean annual zonally averaged climate is well simulated when compared with observations. Deforestation and desertification experiments are performed. In the deforestation experiment, the evergreen broadleaf tree in the Amazonian region is substituted by short grass; in the desertification experiment the semidesert, and the tall grass and deciduous shrubs are substituted by desert and semidesert in the African continent, respectively. The results show that in both the experiments there is a reduction in evapotranspiration and precipitation in the perturbed region and an increase in the soil surface temperature, the temperature of the foliage air layer, and the foliage temperature. Also, the latent heat flux decreased in the perturbed cases relative to the control case. To partially compensate for the decrease in latent heating, sensible heat flux increased in the perturbed cases compared with the control case. The changes in the deforestation case are greater in the latitude belt centered at 5°S, where in most part the Amazonian forest is situated. Otherwise, the changes in the desertification are greater in the latitude belt centered at 15°N. When there is also degradation of the African tropical forest (substitution of evergreen broadleaf trees by short grass), the greatest changes occur southward from that region (in the latitude belt centered at 5°N), and the magnitude of the changes are also increased. This shows the important role of the modification of tropical forest when there is degradation of the vegetation in the African region from 20°N to 0oo. The results regarding the changes in the temperature and in the energy fluxes are in agreement with those of earlier experiments carried out with sophisticated general circulation models, which shows the usefulness of this kind of simple model.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542398197

The weathering rate induced by volcanic acid fluxes, of which the CO2 flux is the most important, can be expressed as an average release rate of dissolved silica, based on a model feldspar-weathering scheme, and the ratio of carbonate-to-silicate rock weathering. The theoretically predicted flux of silica from chemical weathering is slightly smaller than the estimated global riverine silica flux. After adjustment for carbonate weathering, the riverine dissolved bicarbonate flux is larger than the volcanic carbon degassing rate by a factor of about three. There are substantial uncertainties associated with the calculated and observed flux values, but the modern system may either not be in steady state, or additional, ""unknown"" carbon sources may exist. The closure errors in the predicted budgets and observed riverine fluxes suggest that continental weathering rates might have had an impact on atmospheric CO2 levels at a time scale of 103-104 years, and that enhanced weathering rates during glacial periods might have been a factor in the reduced glacial atmospheric CO2 levels. Recent anthropogenic emissions of carbon and sulfur have a much larger acid-generating capacity than the natural fluxes. Estimated potential weathering budgets to neutralize these fluxes are far in excess of observed values. A theoretical scenario for a return to steady state at the current anthropogenic acidity emissions (disregarding the temporary buffering action of the ocean reservoir) requires either significantly lower pH values in continental surface waters as a result of storage of strong acids, and/or higher temperatures as a result of enhanced atmospheric CO2 levels in order to create weathering rates that can neutralize the total flux of anthropogenic and natural background acidity. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Calculated concentration values were compared to concentrations measured continuously at a site near Amsterdam and corrected for background concentrations.

The background corrected outdoor concentrations are a factor of twenty higher than the calculated outdoor concentrations. The most probable sources for this discrepancy are uncertainty in background concentration and the choice of the roughness length in modelling.Within the Dutch National Research Programme on Climate Change, the emission of methane from urban areas was considered to be one of the uncertain sources in the national methane budget. Amsterdam was chosen to be a representative urban area for methane emission assessment. An emission inventory was made and concentration fields were calculated using the Danish OML model. Calculated concentration values were compared to concentrations measured continuously at a site near Amsterdam and corrected for background concentrations. The methane emission of the Amsterdam area is low. Main sources are traffic emissions (1.3 ktons y-1) and the gas distribution network (0.44 ktons y-1). The background corrected outdoor concentrations are a factor of twenty higher than the calculated outdoor concentrations. The most probable sources for this discrepancy are uncertainty in background concentration and the choice of the roughness length in modelling.","Emission; Gas distribution; Methane; Model; Traffic","Climate change; Climatology; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Methane; Motor transportation; Gas distribution; Air pollution; methane; emission inventory; methane; traffic emission; air monitoring; air pollution; article; gas analysis; mathematical analysis; mathematical model; Netherlands; pollution control; urbanization; Amsterdam; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032192704

This direction based on the creation of 3D models from the resin's powder. The physical processes of the new technique similar with STL- process. In spite of the phase state of the initial material (powder) the mechanism of solidification has many skills of STL with viscous digomer. There are many new possibilities in the process with powder polymerization. One can use not mechanical devices (which are very complex) for powder deposition but electrostatic and so on. Some physical phenomena of powder solidification under the CO2-laser action are studied, as speed of the process, which is much higher than under the conventional heating and so on. The experimental results of the process investigation are discussed. In particular the chemical analysis of the solidificated model is made which confirm that initial powder under laser treatment gave perfect resin.

Our results are in clear disagreement with the predictions of a rate-equation model accounting for collisional l mixing. On the other hand, good agreement is found with a model taking solely into account a wake field-induced Stark mixing of degenerate n, l, j substates. Within this model, the values obtained for the electric field agree well with those deduced from measured total stopping power, which indicates that the effect of core electrons must be considered. Furthermore, off-diagonal density matrix elements of the initial capture process to the n = 3 states are inferred from the experimental intensities.

In particular Tyr159 and, in part, Cys42 turned out to be the amino acids which are responsible for the strong dynamic quenching of flavin fluorescence, because two picosecond fluorescence lifetime components <150 ps are clearly present in the wild-type enzyme and in the Cys42 mutants, while only one picosecond lifetime <150 ps is present in the Tyr159 mutant This observation is corroborated by the distance information obtainable from the known three-dimensional structure of the wild-type enzyme. Steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy indicated that the Tyr159 mutant has the same fluorescence yield both Cys42 mutants suggesting that static fluorescence quenching prevails in the tyrosine mutant. Cys42 is the amino acid which is probably responsible for the static quenching in the wild-type enzyme and Y159A mutant. The time-resolved fluorescence anisotropy data showed a dependence on the emission wavelength. In case of proteins with Tyr159 present, less rapid depolarization is observed when the emission wavelength is at 526 nm, while depolarization of a few nanoseconds is more clearly visible at 568 nm. The rapid depolarization process was absent in the Y159A mutant irrespective of emission wavelength. The latter protein only showed a minor component of relatively long correlation time (>10 ns) which can be attributed to energy transfer among the flavins in the tetramer. The rapid ns depolarization is due to excited-state charge transfer between Tyr159 and flavin, which leads to a change of transition moment out of the plane of the isoalloxazine ring. The latter process contributes to a major extent to the observed fluorescence anisotropy decay and can be considered as an unusual source of fluorescence depolarization.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000235660

The project was established in 1992 by nine international organizations. A short description of the DECADES project objectives, structure and main components is given. The technology inventory databases, which are a major part of the project, address all the levels of different energy chains, from fuel extraction through electricity generation to waste disposal. These databases support comparative assessment in the power section, by providing generic information as well as country or region specific information on existing technologies and on those expected to enter the market in the next two to three decades. The paper further touches on the types of assessment that can be carried out using the methodology and databases developed. It points out in this regard the possibilities and limitations of comparative assessments performed at the level of power plant, full electricity supply chain and country or region electricity generation system. Illustrative results are presented for comparisons performed at all these levels. Case studies, workshops and seminars are some of the main activities carried out until now for validation and dissemination of the DECADES Computer Tools. In those studies where it was considered, nuclear power appears to be cost effective for reducing emissions of CO2, SO2, NOx and other greenhouse gases. Finally, the paper briefly introduces the activities envisaged for phase II of the DECADES project, which will focus on disseminating current computer tools, providing training in the use of the tools and supporting country studies and on the development of new analytical capabilities. The paper concludes with some findings and remarks pointing out the usefulness of the integrated framework for comparative assessment developed within the DECADES project in support of decision making.

IAQ issues that can be identified are “building-related illnesses” that may include problems of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). IAQ issues that cannot be identified are termed “sick building syndrome.” Frequently, microorganism-caused illnesses are difficult to confirm. Engineers who provide professional services that directly or indirectly impact IAQ face significant potential liability to clients and third parties when performing these duties. Potential theories supporting liability claims for IAQ problems against engineers include breach of contract and various common law tort theories such as negligence and negligent misrepresentation. Furthermore, an increasing number of federal, state, and local regulations affect IAQ issues and can directly increase the potential liability of engineers. A duty to disclose potential or actual air quality concerns to third parties may apply for engineers in given circumstances. Such a duty may arise from judicial precedent, the Model Guide for Professional Conduct for Engineers, or the Code of Ethics for Engineers. Practical strategies engineers can use to protect themselves from liability include regular training and continuing education in relevant regulatory, scientific, and case law developments; detailed documentation and recordkeeping practices; adequate insurance coverage; contractual indemnity clauses; contractual provisions limiting liability to the scope of work performed; and contractual provisions limiting the extent of liability for engineers' negligence. Furthermore, through the proper use of building materials and construction techniques, an engineer or other design professional can effectively limit the potential for IAQ liability. © 1998 Air and Waste Management Association.",,"Air quality; Insurance; Laws and legislation; Product liability; Engineers' liability; Indoor air quality; Indoor air pollution; volatile organic compound; air conditioning; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; article; engineering; negligence; occupational safety; priority journal; public health; sick building syndrome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032191550

No toxicokinetic studies have been found in the available literature. The acute toxicity of PAN is less than that of ozone, similar to NO2 and higher than SO2. The LC50 in mice and rats were 718-743 mg/m3 (for 2 h) and 470 mg/m3 (for 4 h), respectively. Following acute exposure, severe lung lesions and, at the higher levels, damage to the epithelium of upper parts of the respiratory tract were found in animals. It seems that concentrations of 1.19-1.49 mg/m3 lie not far from the threshold required for pulmonary function effects in sensitive individuals. However, these PAN concentrations are well above the maximum ambient concentrations usually experienced within the USA and Canada (0.003-0.078 mg/m3). It appears unlikely that present ambient PAN concentrations would affect pulmonary functions responses to ambient ozone. In human, the lowest level causing eye irritations was 0.64 mg/m3 for 2 h. Concentrations of 0.99 and 4.95 mg/m3 were identified as no-observed-effect level (NOEL) and no-observed-adverse-effect level (NOAEL) for pathological and histological changes in the respiratory system (nasal passages) of rats during subchronic exposures to PAN, but were not considered to be relevant to derivation of a RfC for chronic inhalation exposure. PAN is a weak point mutagen or clastogen. The data are not sufficient to evaluate its carcinogenicity. No study was found which could be used for the derivation of a RfC for acute or chronic inhalation exposure to PAN.","Animals; Human; Peroxyacetyl nitrate; Review; Toxicology","ozone; peroxyacetylnitrate; air pollutant; article; carcinogenicity; lung function; lung toxicity; priority journal; respiratory system; toxicokinetics; Administration, Inhalation; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Animals; Canada; Carcinogens; Disease Susceptibility; Female; Humans; Male; Mice; Middle Aged; Mutagenicity Tests; No-Observed-Adverse-Effect Level; Peracetic Acid; Rats; Respiratory Function Tests; Respiratory System; Respiratory Tract Diseases; Sunlight; United States; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031781799

These measurements include stress orientations measured from anelastic strain recovery (ASR) tests on core, oriented acoustic log data and 2 micro-frac tests with pre- and post fracture imaging log runs. Micro-fracture tests yield values of 5218 psi to 5326 psi for the minimum horizontal stress and 6904 psi to 7154 psi for the maximum horizontal stress. This represents a relatively large stress anisotropy which, in turn, could result in a sizeable permeability anisotropy. A numerical simulation study was conducted to investigate the impact of horizontal permeability anisotropy and completion strategy on hydrocarbon recovery.

But, it is not clear if management practices have an effect on winter and spring thaw emissions, or if measurements conducted over several years would reveal different emission patterns depending on winter conditions. In this study, we present N2O fluxes obtained using the flux-gradient approach over four winter and spring thaw periods, spanning from 1993 to 1996, at two locations in Ontario, Canada. Several agricultural fields (bare soil, barley, soybean, canola, grass, corn) subjected to various management practices (manure and nitrogen fertilizer addition, alfalfa ploughing, fallowing) were monitored. Nitrous oxide emissions from these fields from January to April over four years ranged between 0 and 4.8 kg N ha-1. These thaw emissions are substantial and should be considered in the nitrous oxide budgets in regions where thaw periods occur. Our study indicates that agricultural management can play a role in mitigating these emissions. Our data show that fallowing, manure application and alfalfa incorporation in the fall lead to high spring emissions, while the presence of plants (as in the case of alfalfa or grass) can result in negligible emissions during thaw. This presents an opportunity for mitigation of N2O emissions through the use of over-wintering cover crops.","Flux-gradient method; Gaseous losses from manure applications; Nitrogen cycle; Spring thaw N2O emissions","emission control; nitrous oxide; soil emission; spring (season); winter; Canada",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031728494

Stable isotopic measurements of methane [δ13C(CH4) and δD(CH4)] can often fingerprint different sources of methane (natural vs. anthropogenic) and help identify the bacterial processes involved in methane production. Landfill microbial communities are complex and diverse, and hence so too is the biogeochemistry of methane formation. To investigate the influence of (1) the methane formation pathway (acetoclastic methanogenesis and CO2 reduction), and (2) δD of water on the stable isotopic composition of landfill methane, two model butyrate-degrading landfill systems were established. The systems were inoculated with domestic refuse from a landfill and incubated in the laboratory for 92 days. Both systems were identical except δD of water initially added to system 2 was 118% heavier than system 1. Between days 39 and 72 the systems were resupplemented with butyrate. Production of CH4 and CO2 and changes in volatile fatty acid concentration confirmed that active methanogenic populations had been established. CH4 became13C enriched in both incubations with time. Interpreting changes in acetate, butyrate, and propionate concentration during incubation is complicated, but these observations and other information suggest that the dominant methanogenic substrate changed front CO2/H2 to acetate as the experiment progressed. This is also consistent with the observed13C enrichment of CH4, as13C discrimination during methane production from acetate is less than from CO2. In contrast, δD(CH4) remained relatively constant, suggesting that this measurement may not provide a reliable basis for distinguishing between CH4 from CO2 reduction and acetoclastic methanogenesis, as has previously been suggested. © 1998 Taylor &amp; Francis.","Acetoclastic methanogenesis; Batch culture enrichment; CO2 reduction; Stable isotopes; VFA analyses","carbon; hydrogen; isotopic composition; landfill; methane; microbial community",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032431809

A small hand held device can be used to assess exhaled CO (ECO) in parts per million. This device is often used in smoking cessation clinics to confirm that a person has abstained from smoking. CASE SUMMARY: A 47-year-old white male became dizzy and had a near syncopal episode while working on his boat in the local marina. He was brought to the ER and was found to have an exhaled CO level of 180 ppm. The presence carboxyhemoglobin (HbCO) was confirmed later by an independent reference laboratory and the result was 26% HbCO. DISCUSSION: The patient's exhaled CO level dropped slower than expected while breathing oxygen delivered by a non-rebreather mask. This could be due to inadequate compliance to oxygen therapy and a fiO2 somewhat less than 1.0. Another limitation of the technique is the calibration gas (50-ppm CO). This concentration may be too low to assess ER patients. Therefore a confirmatory ABG with cooximetry should be obtained if available. Clinicians are cautioned that there is no safe level of HbCO (6). There is a simple formula to convert ECO to HbCO. The use of exhaled CO monitoring may be a promising alternative that is relatively less expensive than cooximetry in the ER setting, but more research is clearly indicated.",,"carbon monoxide; article; blood; breath analysis; carbon monoxide intoxication; case report; human; male; middle aged; Breath Tests; Carbon Monoxide; Carbon Monoxide Poisoning; Humans; Male; Middle Aged",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032039411

A procedure is outlined by which the number densities of ground-state CH (X2P), excited-state CH (A2D, denoted CH*), and excited-state OH (A2R, denoted OH*) are measured and modeled. CH* and OH * number densities are deconvoluted from line-of-sight flame-emission measurements. Ground-state CH is measured using linear LIF. The computations are done with GRI Mech 2.11 as well as an alternate hydrocarbon mechanism. In both cases, additional reactions for the production and consumption of CH* and OH* are added from recent kinetic studies. Collisional quenching and spontaneous emission are responsible for the de-excitation of the excited-state radicals. As with our previous investigations, GRI Mech 2.11 continues to produce very good agreement with the overall flame length observed in the experiments, while significantly under predicting the flame liftoff height. The alternate kinetic scheme is much more accurate in predicting lift-off height but overpredicts the overall flame length. Ground-state CH profiles predicted with GRI Mech 2.11 are in excellent agreement with the corresponding measurements, regarding both spatial distribution and absolute concentration (measured at 4 ppm) of the CH radical. Calculations of the excited-state species show reasonable agreement with the measurements as far as spatial distribution and overall characteristics are concerned. For OH*, the measured peak mole fraction, 1.3 × 10-8, compared well with computed peaks, while the measured peak level for CH*, 2 × 10-9, was severely underpredicted by both kinetic schemes, indicating that the formation and destruction kinetics associated with excited-state species in flames require further research.",,"Fluorescence; Hydrocarbons; Laminar flow; Laser applications; Mathematical models; Quenching; Raman spectroscopy; Reaction kinetics; Axisymmetric laminar diffusion flame; Laser-induced fluorescence (LIF); Flame research",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032270360

Methane emissions from natural wetlands, which constitute the biggest methane source at present and the major non-anthropogenic one, depend highly on the climate. In order to investigate the response of methane emissions from natural wetlands to climate variations, a 1-dimensional process-based climate-sensitive model to derive methane emissions from natural wetlands is developed. In the model the processes leading to methane emission are simulated within a 1-dimensional soil column and the three different transport mechanisms diffusion, plant-mediated transport and ebullition are modeled explicitly. The model forcing consists of daily values of the soil temperature, the water table and the Net Primary Productivity. Tests of the methane model using observed data obtained at 15 field stations within 6 wetlands, representing a large variety of environmental conditions, show good agreement. For the use of the 1-dimensional methane model on the global scale, global data sets for all model parameters are generated, derived from the output of a biosphere model and existing data sets of vegetation and soil properties. Furthermore, a simple hydrological model is developed in order to simulate the position of the water table in wetlands. Tests of the 1-dimensional hydrological model, forced by ECMWF re-analyses with observed water table levels from different wetlands, show a good agreement between model results and observations in general. A global run of the methane model is performed using high-frequency atmospheric forcing fields from the ECMWF re-analyses of the period from 1988 to 1993. The comparison of the simulated global methane emissions from natural wetlands agree surprisingly well with results obtained by an inverse modeling approach, considering the uncertainties of both methods. The modeled methane emissions show high regional, seasonal and interannual variability. The seasonal cycle of simulated global methane emissions is dominated by the seasonal cycle of methane emissions from the higher northern latitudes. The anomalies of the simulated methane emissions are compared to the observed anomalous methane growth rate. This comparison is limited, because we do not take atmospheric transport and the other methane sources and sinks into account and because the observational data do not reflect the true zonal average. The agreement is particularly good in 1992 and 1993 and the results suggest that reduced methane emissions from northern wetlands in 1992, caused by decreased temperatures due to the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo in June 1991, contribute considerably to the observed growth rate minimum in 1992.",,"emission; greenhouse effect; methane; modeling; wetland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344178069

The models have been produced by fitting to experimental neutron diffraction data and by applying various constraints consistent with chemical and physical knowledge of the material. In particular, three different carbon atom types (tetrahedral, planar and linear) have been defined and a new approach to applying coordination number constraints has been developed. The models were generated from an initial random distribution of 3000 atoms and from these we have determined ring number and coordination number distributions that are statistically averaged over the whole structure. We are able to look in detail at the distribution of different types of carbon bonding sites within the box and at the effects of incorporating 5 at.% H into the structure. The new models show that atoms with sp2 bonds tend to cluster and form polymer-like chains, which interlink the regions of sp3 or diamond-like bonding. Also, the relative flexibility of these polymeric chains results in more porous, less dense regions of the network. A comparison with other models for ta-C is also made. © 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

Interwell information required for reservoir characterization can be recovered from low-frequency seismic data by inversion. The stratigraphic features of upward-shoaling sequences can be modeled in stochastic realizations constrained by the high-frequency cycles and rock-fabric flow units. Simulations show that waterflooding performance depends strongly on geometry and stacking pattern of the rock-fabric units and on the location of injection.In part I of this paper, we discussed the rock-fabric/petrophysical classes for dolomitized carbonate-ramp rocks, the effects of rock fabric and pore type on petrophysical properties, petrophysical models for analyzing wireline logs, the critical scales for defining geologic framework, and 3-D geologic modeling. Part II focuses on geophysical and engineering characterizations, including seismic modeling, reservoir geostatistics, stochastic modeling, and reservoir simulation. Synthetic seismograms of 30 to 200 Hz were generated to study the level of seismic resolution required to capture the high-frequency geologic features in dolomitized carbonate-ramp reservoirs. At frequencies <70 Hz, neither the high-frequency cycles nor the rock-fabric units can be identified in seismic data because the tuning thickness of seismic data is much greater than the average thickness of high-frequency cycles of 6 m. At frequencies >100 Hz, major high-porosity and dense mudstone units can be better differentiated, while the rock-fabric units within high-frequency cycles can be captured at frequencies higher than 200 Hz. Seismic inversion was performed on the 30- to 200-Hz synthetic seismograms to investigate the level of seismic resolution required to recover the high-resolution inverted impedance logs. When seismic data were noise free, wavelets were known and sampling rates were high; deconvolution techniques yielded perfect inversion results. When the seismic data were noisy, the inverted reflectivity profiles were poor and complicated by numerous high-frequency spikes, which can be significantly removed using the moving averaging techniques. When wavelets were not known, the predictive deconvolution gave satisfactory inversion results. These results suggest that interwell information required for reservoir characterization can be recovered from low-frequency seismic data by inversion. Outcrop data were collected to investigate effects of sampling interval and scale-up of block size on geostatistical parameters. Semivariogram analysis of outcrop data showed that the sill of log permeability decreases and the correlation length increases with an increase of horizontal block size. Permeability models were generated using conventional linear interpolation, stochastic realizations without stratigraphic constraints, and stochastic realizations with stratigraphic constraints. The stratigraphic feature of upward-shoaling sequences can be modeled in stochastic realizations constrained by the high-frequency cycles and rock-fabric flow units. Simulations of a fine-scale Lawyer Canyon outcrop model were used to study the factors affecting waterflooding performance.

Descriptions of rock-fabric facies stacked within high-frequency cycles provide the most accurate framework for constructing geologic and reservoir models. This is because petrophysical properties can be better grouped by rock fabrics than depositional facies. The permeability-thickness ratios among these rock fabric units can then be used to approximate fluid flow and recovery efficiency.Major issues in characterizing carbonate-ramp reservoirs include geologic framework, seismic stratigraphy, interwell heterogeneity including rock fabric facies and permeability structure, and factors affecting petrophysical properties and reservoir simulation. The Seminole San Andres unit, Gaines County, West Texas, and the San Andres outcrop of Permian age in the Guadalupe Mountains, New Mexico, were selected for an integrated reservoir characterization to address these issues. The paper is divided into two parts. Part I covers petrophysical and geologic characterization, and part II describes seismic modeling, reservoir geostatistics, stochastic modeling, and reservoir simulation. In dolomitic carbonates, two major pore types are interparticle (includes intergranular and intercrystalline) and vuggy. For nonvuggy carbonates the three important petrophysical/rock fabric classes are (I) grainstone, (II) grain-dominated packstone and medium crystalline dolostone, and (III) mud-dominated packstone, wackestone, mudstone, and fine crystalline dolostone. Core data from Seminole showed that rock fabric and pore type have strong positive correlations with absolute and relative permeabilities, residual oil saturation, waterflood recovery, acoustic velocity, and Archie cementation exponent. Petrophysical models were developed to estimate total porosity, separate-vug porosity, permeability, and Archie cementation exponent from wireline logs to account for effects of rock fabric and separate-vug porosity. The detailed and regional stratigraphic models were established from outcrop analogs and applied to seismic interpretation and wireline logs and cores. The aggradational seismic character of the San Andres Formation at Seminole is consistent with the cycle stacking pattern within the reservoir. In particular, the frequent preservation of cycle-based mudstone units in the Seminole San Andres unit is taken to indicate high accommodation associated with greater subsidence rates in this region. A model for the style of high-frequency cyclicity and the distribution of rock-fabric facies within cycles was developed using continuous outcrop exposures at Lawyer Canyon. This outcrop model was applied during detailed core descriptions. These, together with detailed analysis of wireline log signatures, allowed construction of the reservoir framework based on genetically and petrophysically significant high-frequency cycles. Petrophysical properties of total and separate-vug porosities, permeability, water saturation, and rock fabrics were calculated from wireline log data. High-frequency cycles and rock-fabric units are the two critical scales for modeling carbonate-ramp reservoirs. Descriptions of rock-fabric facies stacked within high-frequency cycles provide the most accurate framework for constructing geologic and reservoir models. This is because petrophysical properties can be better grouped by rock fabrics than depositional facies.

For γ-ray pulsars with accelerators very many stellar radii above the neutron star surface, 100 MeV curvature γ-rays from e- or e+ flowing starward out of such accelerators are converted to e± pairs on closed field lines all around the star. These pairs strongly affect X-ray emission from near the star in two ways. (1) The pairs are a source of synchrotron emission immediately following their creation in regions where B ~∼1010 G. This emission, in the photon energy range 0.1 keV ̈ EX ̈ 5 MeV, has a power-law spectrum with energy index 0.5 and X-ray luminosity that depends on the backflow current and is typically ∼1033 ergs s-1. (2) The pairs ultimately form a cyclotron resonance ""blanket"" surrounding the star except for two holes along the open field line bundles that pass through it. In such a blanket, the gravitational pull on e± pairs toward the star is balanced by the hugely amplified push of outflowing surface-emitted X-rays wherever cyclotron resonance occurs. Because of it, the neutron star is surrounded by a leaky ""hohlraum"" of hot blackbody radiation with two small holes, which prevents direct X-ray observation of a heated polar cap of a γ-ray pulsar. Weakly spin-modulated radiation from the blanket together with more strongly spin-modulated radiation from the holes through it would then dominate observed low-energy (0.1-10 keV) emission. For non-γ-ray pulsars, in which no such accelerators with their accompanying extreme relativistic backflow toward the star are expected, optically thick e± resonance blankets should not form (except in special cases very close to the open field line bundle). From such pulsars, blackbody radiation from both the warm stellar surface and the heated polar caps should be directly observable. In these pulsars, details of the surface magnetic field evolution, especially of polar cap areas, become relevant to observations. The models are compared to X-ray data from Geminga, PSR 1055-52, PSR 0656 + 14, PSR 1929 + 10, and PSR 0950 + 08. © 1998. The American Astronomical Society.

Almost all of the previous and current research and development for reducing emissions bas focused, however, on flow, heal transfer, and combustion behavior in the combustors or on the uniformity of fuel injection without placing strong emphasis on the flow uniformity entering the combustors. In response to the incomplete understanding of the combustor's inlet air flow field, experiments were conducted in a 48% scale, 360° model of the diffuser-cotnbustor section of an industrial gas turbine. In addition, the effect of air extraction fnr cooling or gasification on the flow distributions at the combustors' inlets was also investigated. Three different air extractioa rates were studied: 0% (baseline), 5% (airfoil cooling), and 20% (for coal gasification). The flow uniformity was investigated for two aspects: (a) global uniformity, which compared the mass flow rate} of combustors at different locations relative to the extraction port, and (b) local uniformity, which examined the circumferential flow distribution into each combustor. The results indicate that even for the baseline case with no air extraction there was an inherent local flow aonuniformity of 10 ∼20% at the inlet of cacb combustor due to the complex flow field in the dump diffuser and the blockage effect of the cross-flame tube. More flow was seen in the portion further away from tha gas turbine center axis. The effect of 5% air extnctioa was small. Twenty-percent air extraction introduced approximately 35% global flow asymmetry diametrically across the dump diffuser. The effect of air extraction on the combustor's local flow uniformity varied with the distances between the extraction port and each individual combustor. Longer top hats were installed with the initial intention of increasing flow mixing prior to entering the combustor. However, the results indicated that longer top hats do not improve the flow uniformity; sometimes, adverse effects can be seen. Although a specific geometry was selected for this study, the results provide sufficient generality to benefit other industrial gas turbines.

The coordinated dafo-ketal ligand readily forms by the direct reaction of [Ru(bpy)n(dafo)3-n]2+ complexes with ethylene glycol or by reaction of the appropriate ruthenium precursors with the correct stoichiometric amount of the dafo ligand in ethylene glycol. In each series, the visible absorption band associated with the MLCT transition shifts to the blue and the electrochemical oxidation associated with the Ru(III)/Ru(II) couple becomes more positive as n decreases. Coordinated dafo undergoes a one-electron reduction at potentials &lt;-1 V and a second one-electron reduction at ∼-1.2 V vs SSCE. The first reduction can be associated with reduction of the carbonyl group; the second, with reduction of the bipyridine portion. Coordinated dafo-ketal only reduces at potentials &lt;-1.2 V. The emission properties place the emitting state of the complexes on the bipyridine portion of the dafo ligand, not the carbonyl group. At 77 K in a 4:1 ethanol-methanol glass, the emission lifetimes fall in a range of 5-2 μs as n decreases. In fluid solution, the emission lifetimes are temperature dependent with activation energies that vary from 1400 to 500 cm-1 as n decreases.

Variation in natural CO2 concentrations occurring over 103-105 years are set by oceanic processes, and in particular by conditions in the Southern Ocean, so it is to this region that we must look to understand the glacial-interglacial changes in CO2 concentrations. It seems likely that marine productivity in the Southern Ocean is limited by a combination of restricted iron supply to the region and insufficient light. Plankton-produced DMS is thought to influence climate by changing the numbers of cloud condensation nuclei available in remote regions; the efficiency of this mechanism is still unknown, but calculations suggest it may be a powerful influence on climate. It has a much shorter time-scale than the CO2 effect, and as a consequence may well be a player on the 'global change' time-scale. The direction of both the CO2 and the DMS mechanisms is such that more marine productivity would lead to lower global temperatures, and we speculate that the overall effect of the marine biota today is to cool the planet by ca. 6 C as a result of these two mechanisms, with one-third of this figure being due to CO2 effects and two-thirds due to DMS. While the marine biota influence climate, climate also influences the marine biota, chiefly via changing atmospheric circulation. This in turn alters ocean circulation patterns, responsible for mixing up subsurface nutrients, and also influences the transport of nutrients, such as iron, in atmospheric dust. A more vigorous atmospheric circulation would be expected to increase the productivity of the marine biota on both counts. Thus during glacial time, the colder and drier climate might be expected to stimulate greater marine productivity than occurs today. Since more production leads to greater cooling by reduction in CO2 and increase in DMS, the marine biota-climate system appears to have been in positive feedback in the glacial-interglacial transition, with the changes in the climate system being reinforced by changes in the marine biota. In the context of anthropogenic change, we cannot at present say what sign the feedback on climate will have, because we have no clear idea whether circulation will become more or less vigorous in the future.","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Dimethyl sulphide; Palaeoclimate; Phytoplankton","atmospheric circulation; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; climate; marine biota; ocean circulation; sulphur cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032576669

We have then discriminated AGNs from H II region-like galaxies (hereafter H II galaxies) in the manner developed by Veilleux & Osterbrpck using the additional information provided by Hα and [N II] 6583 Å or Hα and [S II] 6716 + 6731 Aα emission, in order to test the reliability of the selection criteria used by Dressier and coworkers. We find that before we discriminate AGNs from H II galaxies, our sample is very similar to that of Dressier and coworkers and it leads to similar conclusions. However, we find that their method inevitably mixes H II galaxies with AGNs, even for the most luminous objects in our sample. We estimate a contamination of at least 38% at a formal 90% confidence level. Since the study of Dressier and coworkers, other authors have attempted to quantify the relative fraction of cluster-to-field AGNs and have reached similar conclusions, but they have used criteria similar to Dressier and coworkers to select AGNs (or have used the [O III] 5007 Å/Hβ flux ratio test that also mixes H II galaxies with AGNs). Our sample of true AGNs remains too small to reach statistically meaningful conclusions, therefore a new study with a more time-consuming method that includes the other lines will be required to quantify the true relative fraction of cluster-to-field AGNs. © 1998.

The World Climate Research Programme's (WCRP) Global Ocean-Atmosphere-Land System (GOALS) program seeks to explore predictability of the global climate system through investigation of the major planetary heat sources and sinks and interactions between them. The Asian-Australian monsoon system, which undergoes aperiodic and high amplitude variations on intraseasonal, annual, biennial and interannual timescales is a major focus of GOALS. Empirical seasonal forecasts of the monsoon have been made with moderate success for over 100 years. More recent modeling efforts have not been successful. Even simulation of the mean structure of the Asian monsoon has proven elusive and the observed ENSO-monsoon relationships has been difficult to replicate. Divergence in simulation skill occurs between integrations by different models or between members of ensembles of the same model. This degree of spread is surprising given the relative success of empirical forecast techniques. Two possible explanations are presented: difficulty in modeling the monsoon regions and nonlinear error growth due to regional hydrodynamical instabilities. It is argued that the reconciliation of these explanations is imperative for prediction of the monsoon to be improved. To this end, a thorough description of observed monsoon variability and the physical processes that are thought to be important is presented.

Nonoxidative methane activation is characterized by an induction period prior to the formation of benzene, toluene, and naphthalene. During this induction period the supported metal oxide is reduced and CO, CO2, and H2O are formed. Optimum catalytic performance was obtained for CO-prereduced 2-4 wt% TMI/H-ZSM-5 zeolites, and their activities decreased in the order: Mo (18.3) &gt; W (10.8) &gt; Fe (5.7) &gt; V (3.9) &gt; Cr (1.5).

Heavy vehicles are defined as Class 7 & 8 trucks (> 118,000 pounds GVW), and transit buses that have a fuel usage greater than 10,000 gallons per year and driving range of more than 300 miles. The key in making LNG market-competitive with all types of diesel fuels is in improving energy efficiency and reducing costs of LNG technologies through systems integration. This paper integrates together the three LNG technologies of: (1) production from landfills and remote well sites; (2) cryogenic fuel delivery systems; and (3) state-of-the-art storage tank and refueling facilities, with market end-use strategies. The program's goal is to develop these technologies and strategies under a ""green"" and ""clean"" strategy. This ""green"" approach reduces the net contribution of global warming gases by reducing levels of methane and carbon dioxide released by heavy vehicles usage to below recoverable amounts of natural gas from landfills and other natural resources. Clean technology refers to efficient use of energy with low environmental emissions. The objective of the program is to promote fuel competition by having LNG priced between $ 0.40-$ 0.50 per gallon with a combined production, fuel delivery and engine systems efficiency approaching 45%. This can make LNG a viable alternative to diesel. © 1998 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Carbon dioxide; Commerce; Cryogenics; Diesel fuels; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; Fuel storage; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Liquefied natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Brookhaven national laboratory; Clean technologies; Department of Energy; Efficient use of energy; Environmental emissions; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Liquid natural gas; Systems integration; Natural gas vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072470552

One of the examples studied, the landslide in the valley of Birahi Ganga (Northern India), is one of the most impressive examples of recent hazards in alpinotype high mountain regions. This study was complemented by a study of the Ghatta Khola landslide (Western Nepal). In both cases, lithotectonic and climatic conditions led to the destabilisation and failure of carbonate bedrock. The occurrence of lakes, dammed over long periods behind the barriers, is of great importance, because after the sometimes fatal landslide event itself, one is confronted and has to cope with a secondary natural hazard, the possibility of a major flood due to the failure of the dam. That is why the preparatory causal factors of the origin of the two lakes (by damming up the river due to the landslide) and their stepwise disappearance (by secondary landslides within the barrier and sedimentation into the basin) were additionally focused upon. It is shown that due to very special circumstances (availability of sediments, heavy rainfall) in the Himalayas there is a progressive decrease in the potential hazard to the landscape and to human beings lower down the main valleys over a period of only a few decades.",,"dam; hazard assessment; lake; landslide; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032418158

We report nitrous oxide (N2O), nitric oxide (NO), and methane (CH4) fluxes from secondary forest soils prior to and during deforestation, and throughout the first agricultural cropping. Annual average nitrogen oxide emissions from forest soils were 1.5 ng N cm-2 h-1 for N2O and 0.9 ng N cm-2 h-1 for NO. Forest clearing increased the level of extractable nitrate in soils and average nitrogen oxides fluxes (2.7 ng N cm-2 h-1 for N2O, and 8.1 ng N cm-2 h-1 for NO). Immediately after biomass burning, short-term peaks of N2O and NO (123 ng N cm-2 h-1 for N2O, and 41 ng N cm-2 h-1 for NO) were superimposed on generally increased fluxes. Peak emissions declined within 3 days after burning. Postburn fluxes stayed higher than measured on adjacent forest sites for 3-4 months (averages for postburn fluxes were 17.5 ng N cm-2 h-1 for N2O, and 19.2 ng N cm-2 h-1 for NO). Increased N2O and NO emissions after clearing and until cropping were probably due to a combination of increased rates of nitrogen cycling and higher gaseous diffusion in drying soils. Compared to emissions from young pastures in the region, fluxes of nitrogen oxides from unfertilized agricultural areas were low (3.9 ng N cm-2 h-1 for N2O and 3.4 ng N cm-2 h-1 for NO), probably due to nitrogen uptake by fast growing corn plants and losses by leaching with draining soil water in the wet season. Variation in CH4 fluxes was high for all land use periods. Forest soils consumed an average of 1.0 mg CH4 m-2 d-1, which slightly increased in drier soils after clearing (1.2 mg CH4 m-2 d-1). Postburn CH4 consumption by soils was slightly reduced (0.8 mg CH4 m-2 d-1) compared to forest soils. Unfertilized agricultural soils consumed less CH4 than forest soils.

In the Extrap T1 RFP, the anisotropic, parallel heat flux in the edge region measured by calorimetry was typically several hundred MW m-2. To gain more insight into the origin of the hot electron component and to achieve time resolution of the hot electron flow during the discharge, a target probe with a soft x-ray monitor was designed, calibrated and implemented. The x-ray emission from the target was measured with a surface barrier detector covered with a set of different x-ray filters to achieve energy resolution. A calibration in the range 0.5-2 keV electron energy was performed on the same target and detector assembly using a LaB6 cathode electron gun. The calibration data are interpolated and extrapolated numerically. A directional asymmetry of more than a factor of 100 for the higher energy electrons is observed. The hot electrons are estimated to constitute 10% of the total electron density at the edge and their energy distribution is approximated by a half-Maxwellian with a temperature slightly higher than the central electron temperature.

The model is based on semiempirical quantum molecular orbital calculations using the Austin method AM1. The fracture of three-, four-, five- and six-member silica rings is modelled in four cases to determine the reaction pathways under strain in vacuum, carbon monoxide, water and nitrogen (N2). A low-energy reaction path was found for the fracture event through a ring contraction mechanism in the case of vacuum, carbon monoxide and nitrogen. Ring opening through hydrolysis was found to be the lowest-energy pathway in the case of water-enhanced fracture. The calculated transition-state energy barriers were used to estimate the crack velocity V as a function of stress intensity K I for all four environmental effects in amorphous silica assuming a Bell—Dean distribution of ring sizes. The quantum mechanics fracture model and experimental V—K I curves exhibit the same sequence of environmental effects. The contractions of the ring during fracture are related to the fractal nature of the fracture surface.

Over a 6-month period, simulated landfill cells filled with raw waste generated 66 liters methane per kg of dry refuse, while cells containing composted SW produced 31 liters methane per kg of dry compost. Per unit weight of the original dry raw SW, composted SW placed in a simulated landfill environment produced only 15 liters methane per kg dry raw SW which is 23% of the methane that was generated when the raw SW was placed directly in the simulated landfill cells.Methane contributes approximately 20% to the annual increase in global warming, and is explosive at concentrations of 5 to 15% in air. Landfills are the origin of approximately 15% of the total global methane emissions. This study was conducted to determine the potential decrease in methane production from municipal landfills if the organic components of solid waste (SW) are composted prior to landfilling. The quantities and rates of methane production were measured using simulated landfill cells containing composted and raw simulated SW.

The closed setting was a water-filled passage in a cave. Samples of groundwater and of a solid that appeared to be suspended in the relatively fresh region of saline-freshwater mixing zone were collected. The solid was determined to be aragonite. Based on the analyses of the composition and saturation state of the groundwater, the mixing of fresh and saline water and precipitation of aragonite are the controlling geochemical processes in this mixing zone. We found no evidence of sulfate reduction. Thus, this mixing zone is similar to that observed in Caleta Xel Ha, Quintana Roo, also a system that is closed with respect to input from the land surface. The open setting was an unconfined aquifer underlying the coastal plain along which four hand-dug wells are located. Two wells are at the downgradient ends of inferred flowpaths and one is along a flowpath. The composition of the groundwater in the downgradient wells is sulfide-rich and brackish. In contrast, at the well located along a flow line, the groundwater is oxygenated and brackish. All groundwater is oversaturated with respect to calcite, aragonite, and dolomite. The composition is attributed to mixing of fresh and saline groundwater, CO2 outgassing, and sulfate reduction.

Reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the US Department of Energy note that buildings account for 25-30% of total energy-related carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. This means building energy use contributes 10-12% of the increasing net radiative forcing that is inducing global warming. On average, between 1980 and 1990, CO2 emissions from buildings have grown by 1.7% per year with rates of growth four times greater in developing countries. The high growth in developing countries is mainly due to changes in structural factors (demographics, economic growth) and increases in the amount of energy services demanded by energy consumers. Experience in OECD countries has shown that technologies and policies exist to significantly reduce energy demand in buildings. Some of the main policy instruments to reduce energy demand include energy efficiency standards for buildings and appliances, voluntary agreements, financial/economic incentives, and market transformation programs. When converted to carbon emissions, energy forecasts of the World Energy Council suggest that business-as-usual trends will result in building CO2 emissions growing by 2.6% a year to the year 2020, with the vast majority of the growth taking place in non-OECD countries. Significant opportunities to help raise building energy efficiency at home and abroad exist, should countries begin to more fully commit to mitigating greenhouse gases. Commitments by countries to contain the growth of greenhouse gas emissions in an economically sound manner is likely to induce significant increases in the investment in energy-efficient technologies.","Buildings; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon savings; Climate change; Developing countries; Eastern Europe and former Soviet Union; Energy efficiency; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Impact of mitigation policies; Industrialized countries",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0040585562

Climate change first became a major subject of scientific inquiry in the early 1980s, and real political interest in the issue was awakened towards the end of that decade. In the last few years, the dialogue between the scientific community and the political sector has increased considerably. As a result, climate change is today one of the most significant areas in environmental research and international environmental policy alike. This paper examines the emergence and consolidation of international climate change regime. The theory of regime building is used as discussed by Young (1989). International Cooperation.

Biogenic emissions are particularly interesting since they are highly uncertain, and they are unaffected by traditional anthropogenic control measures. Yet, biogenic emissions impact air quality especially the effectiveness of controls on volatile organic compounds. Therefore, it is prudent to investigate the impact that uncertain biogenic emissions estimates (and in general, all emissions estimates) have on emissions control scenarios. First, new biogenic emissions estimates are prepared for the 27-29 August 1987 episode in the South Coast Air Basin (SoCAB) of Los Angeles, California using current state-of-the-science biogenic emissions estimates models.

There is less agreement about just how much warming is likely in any particular region, such as the Canadian Plains, and the situation with regard to future rainfall and wind climates is even more uncertain. But we need to make the best guesses we can about the range of possibilities and the likely impacts, particularly on agriculture, if we are to react intelligently to the changing climate. Many climate impact studies estimate how warming due to carbon dioxide doubling might affect a specific crop, ignoring the probable changes in crops as the climate warms, for instance from spring wheat to winter wheat or corn, and disregarding possible adverse effects like more frequent dust storms. In this article we look at Saskatchewan under several different warm climate scenarios, and see how these might affect biomass in general, rather than a particular crop, and what they might do to wind erosion. Apparently, warming over the next few decades could be expected to reduce biomass productivity in the agricultural zone, although it would increase it in the Canadian Shield areas. Throughout Saskatchewan the peak growth season would arrive earlier, and there would be more risk of wind erosion in midsummer. More rain would help offset the adverse impacts. Our results also indicated that with further warming, trends in biomass potential would reverse themselves, in fact more than once: for example, in the south they would stop declining and begin to rise, but later on they would go down again.",,"biomass; climatic change; crop yield; wind erosion; Canada, Saskatchewan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031693881

Community settings were superior to hospital wards in providing more privacy for the residents and were better equipped with physical amenities and safety features. There were relatively small differences between the way staff perceived the social climate in community homes and in hospital. The former were regarded as encouraging greater independence. Care staff in the hospital were more likely to express dissatisfaction with pay, working conditions and social status, while community staff were more dissatisfied with the quality of cooperation between staff members. Clients transferred to Social Services facilities had a higher level of functioning and needed less on-site medical care. This was further reflected by the lower frequency of nursing care tasks being performed by staff in community facilities.

These are the world's first liquid-fueled, fuel cell powered road vehicles. This paper describes the emissions testing of one of these buses on a heavy duty chassis dynamometer at West Virginia University (WVU). The tested bus was driven by a 120 kW DC motor and utilized a 50 kW phosphoric acid fuel cell (PAFC) as an energy source with a 100 kW battery for supplemental power. A methanol/water fuel mixture was converted by a steam reformer to a hydrogen rich gas mixture for use in a fuel cell stack. Emissions from the reformer, fuel cell stack and startup burner were monitored for both transient and steady-state operation. It was concluded that this first-generation fuel cell bus offers an attractive approach to reducing emissions of particulate matter (PM), oxides of nitrogen (NOx), hydrocarbons (HC) and carbon dioxide (CO2) relative to conventional drivetrain transit buses operating on both diesel and alternative fuels. Carbon monoxide (CO) emissions were similar to existing alternative fuel buses, and further analysis revealed the cause of this unexpected result was linked to the flow of methanol into the reformer burner. Alternative operating strategies are being incorporated into the next generation fuel cell buses resulting in greatly reduced carbon monoxide emissions.

We found under moderate conditions of temperature and photosynthetic flux density (PFD) (26°C and 700 μmol quanta m-2 s-1, similar to growth conditions) photosynthesis in the flag leaf of rice during heading and grain filling saturated at near ambient levels of CO2, with a concomitant loss of O2 sensitivity, when a high stomatal conductance was maintained by high humidity (low vapor pressure deficit). Under 18°C there was near complete loss of O2 sensitivity of photosynthesis at normal ambient levels of CO2. This is in contrast to the large enhancement of photosynthesis by supra-atmospheric levels of CO2 and sub-atmospheric levels of O2 by suppression of photorespiration when there is no limitation on utilizing the initial product of CO2 assimilation (triose-P) as predicted from Ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) kinetic properties. Thus, loss of sensitivity to CO2 and O2 has been previously explained as a limitation on utilization of triose-P to synthesize carbohydrates. Under high PFD at 25°C, the rate of photosynthesis in rice declined over a period of hours around midday, while the intercellular levels of CO2 remained constant suggesting a limitation on utilization of photosynthate. Short-term fluctuations in climatic factors including temperature, light and humidity could result in a feedback limitation on photosynthesis in rice which may be exacerbated by rising CO2.","Photosynthesis; Rice","carbon dioxide; enzyme kinetics; gas exchange; humidity; oxygen; photorespiration; photosynthesis; photosynthetic flux density; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; temperature; triose phosphate; Oryza sativa; Oryza sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031667061

For purely substitutional carbon, a strong nonlinearity in the dependence of the bulk-alloy lattice constant on the concentration is found. In the linear regime of small carbon concentrations, this leads to a much more rapid decrease of the lattice constant with carbon concentration than predicted by Vegard’s law. A comparison of our dependence of the lattice constants in (Formula presented) and (Formula presented) alloys on the concentrations suggests a germanium-carbon strain compensation ratio of (Formula presented):1. This ratio is found to decrease when interstitial carbon is present. These results are compared with recent experiments, where the strain as well as the fraction of interstitial carbon have been measured. We also examine the band structure of (Formula presented) alloys in the technically interesting concentration range of a few percent carbon. We find that the carbon-induced states are highly localized, and can form a deep level in the band gap of silicon. We show that these findings are an important step toward an understanding of recent experimental photoluminescence spectra. © 1998 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0001018052

As the heterodyne receiver basically employs the beating effect, such intricate questions as “is there still a beating between the (many) local oscillator photons and the few return photons?” or “how can a single photon produce an intermediate frequency?” arise. We show that the semiclassical theory, which provides exact results as long as optical fields with an adequate classical description are used, is capable of answering those questions.

METHODS: A total of 219 patients with disease visualized on computed tomographic scan (recurrent or metastatic disease) or with negative or equivocal computed tomographic scan and rising carcinoembryonic antigen serum levels (occult group) received technetium Tc 99m-labeled 88BV59 intravenously. Planar and single photon emission computed tomographic images were obtained 14 to 20 hours postinfusion, before surgery. The ability of computed tomographic and HumaSPECT®-Tc imaging to define the extent of disease and to predict resectability was evaluated based on surgical and histopathologic results. RESULTS: In patients with recurrent or metastatic disease (170 evaluable patients), the accuracy of predicting nonresectability of disease was significantly greater (P < 0.001) for HumaSPECT®-Tc than for computed tomography (60 vs. 29 percent). Computed tomography understaged 41 percent of patients believed to have resectable disease compared with 27 percent for HumaSPECT®-Tc (P < 0.001). In occult disease patients (29 computed tomographic and 28 HumaSPECT®-Tc evaluable patients), the overall accuracy of predicting resectability/nonresectability was 68 percent for HumaSPECT®- Tc compared with 24 percent for computed tomography. Administration of HumaSPECT®-Tc had no effect on monoclonal antibody-based in vitro diagnostic assays. Only a single patient demonstrated an anti-antibody response (90 ng/ml) at nine weeks postinfusion. CONCLUSION: HumaSPECT®-Tc was more accurate than computed tomography in determining disease resectability in patients with metastatic, recurrent, or occult cancer. The addition of HumaSPECT®-Tc imaging can play a significant role in patient management decisions.","88BV59; Colorectal cancer; Human monoclonal antibody; HumaSPECT®-Tc; Monoclonal antibody imaging; Technetium","humaspect tc; monoclonal antibody; technetium 99m; unclassified drug; article; cancer recurrence; cancer scintiscanning; clinical protocol; clinical trial; colorectal cancer; computer assisted tomography; diagnostic accuracy; human; immunoscintigraphy; intravenous drug administration; major clinical study; metastasis; occult cancer; phase 3 clinical trial; preoperative evaluation; single photon emission computer tomography; Adult; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Colorectal Neoplasms; Female; Humans; Male; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Radioimmunodetection; Safety; Technetium; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; Whole-Body Counting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031824063

Design/setting/participants - This study examined the changes, one and two years after the introduction of the intervention, in airway hyperreactivity of non-asthmatic and non-wheezing, primary 4, 5, and 6, school children aged 9-12 years living in a polluted district compared with those in a less polluted district. Bronchial hyperreactivity (BHR) (a 20% decrease in FEV, provoked by a cumulative dose of histamine less than 7.8 μmol) and bronchial reactivity slope (BR slope) (percentage change in logarithmic scale in FEV, per unit dose of histamine) were used to estimate responses to a histamine challenge. The between districts differences after the intervention were studied to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Main results - In cohorts, comparing measurements made before the intervention and one year afterwards, both BHR and BR slope declined from 29% to 16% (p = 0.026) and from 48 to 39 (p = 0.075) respectively in the polluted district; and from 21% to 10% (p = 0.001) and 42 to 36 (p > 0.100) in the less polluted district. Comparing measurements made in 1991 (one year after intervention) with those in 1992 (two years after intervention), only the polluted district showed a significant decline from 28% to 12% (p = 0.016) and from 46 to 35 (p = 0.014), for BHR and BR slope respectively, with a greater decline in both responses (p = 0.018 and 0.073) than in the less polluted district. Conclusion - Bronchial hyperresponsiveness tests can be used to support the evaluation of an air quality intervention. The demonstrated reduction in bronchial hyperresponsiveness is an indication of the effectiveness of the intervention.",,"fuel; histamine; sulfur; air pollution; child health; medical geography; pollution control; respiratory disease; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; article; bronchus hyperreactivity; bronchus reactivity; comparative study; controlled study; forced expiratory volume; Hong Kong; human; major clinical study; primary school; provocation test; rating scale; school child; statistical analysis; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031692065

No significant differences in egg hatching or chick fledging rates were observed between these groups and nests left unmanipulated at both reference areas (group C) and the contaminated area (group D). Mass increase rates of chicks differed significantly (p = 0.03), with the highest rates from group C and the lowest rates from group B. This difference cannot be easily attributed to differences in parental nest attentiveness or food provisioning, which were greater at the contaminated area.

Single crystal X-ray diffraction reveals that MOP is a planar molecule. The binding of the above two complexes, Ru(bpy)2NOP2+ and (NOP=2-(4-nitrophenyl)imidazo[4,5-f][1,10] phenanthroline) to calf thymus DNA is investigated using various photophysical methods. Considerable absorption, hypo-and bathochromicity, as well as enantiomeric selectivity demonstrate that the complexes bind to DNA through intercalation of MOP, DMNP or NOP into the base pairs. The absorption change, regarding the DMNP or NOP localized transition, provides a unique 'direct' criterion. Steady-state emission enhancement, reduced accessibility to ferrocyanide quencher, and an excited-state lifetime increase are also observed for Ru(bpy)2MOP2+ and Ru(bpy)2DMNP2+ once bound to DNA. The monoexponential emission-decay profiles infer that the perpendicular intercalation might be the sole binding mode. Owing to a relatively low sensitivity to collision-quenching by neighboring molecules, the emission change of Ru(bpy)2DMNP2+ is lower than that of Ru(bpy)2MOP2+. No emission is observed for Ru(bpy)2NOP2+ due to intramolecular electron transfer caused by -NO2, which is unaffected by DNA. © 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

It has been found in both fast-and slow-growing plants and is largely independent of the duration of exposure. Changes in leaf quality are thus to be expected, irrespective of other plant responses to atmospheric CO2 enrichment. However, there is no experimental evidence from tropical forests, the biome with the largest biomass carbon pool. Here we report in situ mesophyll responses of mature tropical trees to a doubling of CO2. Individually CO2-enriched leaves on 25 to 35-m-tall forest trees living at 26-35°C can be assumed to experience little sink limitation, and so, may be expected to exhibit no or very little carbohydrate accumulation. We tested this hypothesis using the leaf cup method on leaves accessible via the canopy crane of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in a semi-deciduous tropical forest in Panama. We also investigated the influence of the leaf-specific light regime, another possible environmental determinant of leaf carbon gain and mobile leaf carbohydrates. Total non-structural carbohydrates (TNC) reached a new steady state concentration after less than 4 days of exposure to twice ambient CO2 concentration. Against expectation, all four tree species investigated (Anacardium excelsum, Cecropia longipes, C. peltata, Ficus insipida) accumulated significant amounts of TNC (+41 to +61%) under elevated CO2. The effect was stronger at the end of the daylight period (except for Ficus), but was still significant in all four species at the end of the dark period. In contrast, neither artificial nor natural shading affected leaf TNC. Taken together, these observations suggest that TNC accumulation reflects a mesophyll-bound tissue response specific to elevated CO2, presumably unrelated to sink limitations. Thus, leaves of tropical forests seem not to be an exception, and will most likely contain more non-structural carbohydrates in a CO2-rich world.","Anacardium; Cecropia; Elevated CO2; Ficus; Light climate","carbon dioxide enrichment; leaf; response analysis; tropical forest; Panama; Anacardium excelsum; Cecropia longipes; Cecropia peltata; Ficus inspidia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0031710814

Their emission properties are presented here and compared with those of normal pulsars. Although we demonstrated in Paper I that millisecond pulsars exhibit the same flux density spectra and a similar profile complexity, the results presented here suggest that millisecond pulsar profiles do not comply with the predictions of classification schemes based on normal pulsars. The frequency development of a large number of millisecond pulsar profiles is abnormal when compared with the development seen in normal pulsars. Moreover, the polarization characteristics suggest that millisecond-pulsar magnetospheres might not simply represent scaled versions of the magnetospheres of normal pulsars, supporting the results of Paper I. However, phenomena such as mode-changing activity in both intensity and polarization are recognized here for the first time (e.g., for J1730-2304). This suggests that while the basic emission mechanism remains insensitive to rotational period, the conditions that regulate the radio emission in the canonical pulsar model might be satisfied at different regions in millisecond pulsar magnetospheres. At least three types of model have been proposed to describe the millisecond pulsar magnetospheres, ranging from distorted magnetic field configurations resulting from the recycled nature of these sources to traditional polar-cap emission and emission from outer gaps. A comparison of the predictions of these models with observations suggests that individual cases are better explained by different processes. However, we show that millisecond pulsars can be grouped according to common emission properties, a grouping that awaits verification with future multifrequency observations. © 1998.

Quantitative determination of the surface coverage and qualitative assessment of the physisorption strength of 2,6-AQDS adsorption on each of these electrodes were done. The diamond and HGC surfaces are nonpolar and relatively oxygen-free, with the surface carbon atoms terminated by hydrogen. The polar 2,6-AQDS does not adsorb on these surfaces, and the electrolysis proceeds by a diffusion-controlled reaction. Conversely, the GC and HOPG surfaces are polar, with the exposed defect sites terminated by carbon-oxygen functionalities. 2,6-AQDS strongly physisorbs on both of these surfaces at near monolayer or greater coverages, such that the electrolysis proceeds through a surface-confined state. Less than 40% of the initial surface coverage can be removed by rinsing and solution replacement, reflective of strong physisorption. The results show the important role of the surface carbon - oxygen functionalities in promoting strong dipole - dipole and ion - dipole interactions with polar and ionic molecules such as 2,6-AQDS. The results also support the theory that diamond electrodes may be less subject to fouling by polar adsorbates, as compared to GC, leading to improved response stability in electroanalytical measurements.

Previous work showed that selective extraction techniques developed for base metals are ineffective for Au extraction. The mobile forms of Au in overburden occur not only as ionic or complex forms but also as ultrafine particles (submicron to nanometer) dispersed in, or bound onto, water-soluble salts, colloidal particles, organic matter, iron and manganese oxides or clay minerals. The conventional approach of partial leach methods, developed for base metals, involves using appropriate extractants to attack the host materials and release the trapped mobile forms of metals into solution. But the ultrafine Au particles thus released from the host are either insoluble in the mild extractant or reabsorbed by colloids. Therefore a two-stage selective leaching scheme has been developed for Au, a sequential leaching procedure to destroy the host materials, followed by a second treatment to place the Au released from the first stage into solution for analysis. This method has been used widely in detailed, regional and strategic exploration in overburden terrains. Case studies from different climatic and geographic settings show that selective leaching of optimum mobile forms of metals in different settings can be effective in finding indications of mineralization. In temperate alluvial terrains, water-extractable and adsorbed or exchangeable forms of metals give the most prominent expression. In arid sandy desert terrains, water-extractable metals and metals in oxides are the best indicators. In cold grasslands, organically bound and water-extractable metals are the most effective indicators of mineralization of depth.Sequential leaching of mobile forms of metals in overburden (MOMEO) was developed for Au.

The results are compared with those obtained over Cu-ZSM-5, which is known to possess very high activity for the direct decomposition. When propene was added as reductant, Fe-ZSM-5 showed very high activity even in the low-temperature region and at low propene concentrations, whereas Cu-ZSM-5 was strongly deactivated. In the case of Fe-ZSM-5, no significant deactivation in the presence of water vapor or oxygen has been detected in the transient responses compared with the values of Cu-ZSM-5. Furthermore, in the case of Fe-ZSM-5, the oxidation of C3H6 is directly correlated to the conversion of N2O, indicating that the selective catalytic reduction is the preferred reaction.

In order to decrease such air pollutant, it is necessary to clarify the mechanism of waste combustion which consists of very complex phenomena. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to predict the characteristics of combustion in waste layer of stoker-type incinerator which is used widely, and to propose a model of combustion in waste layer. In this model, we consider interactions between solid and gas, assuming that waste layer is porous media. Additionally, we also consider chemical reactions on the basis of coal combustion. Especially, the model is made by considering the emissions of CO and NOx, because CO concentration is related with the emission of dioxin proportionally, and NOx emission is a source of air pollution. In this paper, the model of combustion in waste layer of stoker-type incinerator is described in detail, and the calculation results are reported.",,"Air pollution control; Carbon monoxide; Coal combustion; Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Porous materials; Stokers; Stoker-type incinerators; Waste layers; Refuse incinerators",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12844251570

The actual growth varies from conditions of local climate which is a much more important consideration in flower production. This research studied climatic effects on plant height, aboveground dry weight, and days to flowering of two Asiatic and two Oriental hybrid lilies in the experimental farm of Taiwan Agricultural Research Institute (TARI), Taichung during 1995-1996. The weather data were collected from weather station located at TARI. It was shown that plant height was significantly correlated with the accumulated irradiance, but not others, of the growing season. Although with different sowing dates, plant elongation was gradually increased as solar radiation accumulated. Patterns of aboveground dry weight were quite similar to that of plant height and were also significant in second order regression equations. For all cultivars, time from sowing to flowering had linear relationships with the average temperature, cumulative irradiance, and cumulative sunshine hour of the growing periods. A negative correlation was found with the average temperature of the growing period, time to flowering decreased as the average temperature increased and Oriental hybrid lilies needed more time to reach flowering than those of Asiatic lilies. On the other hand, Oriental hybrids needed more cumulative irradiance and sunshine hour to anthesis than those of Asiatic ones. By stepwise regression analyses, results showed that each cultivar has different climatic factors as prevailing element(s). To minimize the risk of climatic hazard in growing hybrid lilies in the central part of Taiwan, it is not recommended to plant these hybrid lilies from April to August.","Climatic effect; Environment; Flowering; Growth; Hybrid lily; Yield",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33748634337

The AF in benzene solution showed substantial red-shiftings of its fluorescence following addition of alcohol. Fluorescence decay analysis revealed that two different relaxed hydrogen-bonded states exist: an emissive state and a nonemissive state. These different states are due to the microscopic anisotropy of the hydrogen bond around the carbonyl oxygen. In the emissive state, the hydroxy group of the alcohol interacts through an in-plane mode with the carbonyl oxygen of AF, while the alcohol interacts through an out-of-plane mode in the nonemissive state. The out-of-plane mode was shown to be more common with cumene hydroperoxide and diols than with ethanol owing to their steric hindrance in the in-plane mode.

But for Single-quantum-well (SQW) lasers, because of the large increase of the leakage current, the threshold current increases with n-type doping.","Doped lases; Quantum well; Quantum-well lasers; Semiconductor device modeling; Semiconductor lasers; Spontaneous emission; Visible lasers","Computational methods; Leakage currents; Light emission; Semiconducting aluminum compounds; Semiconducting gallium compounds; Semiconductor device models; Semiconductor doping; Strain; Tensile properties; Single quantum well (SQW) lasers; Tensile-strained quantum well lasers; Threshold currents; Quantum well lasers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032163678

This will increase the demand for irrigation because irrigation gives a higher potential yield per unit area than non-irrigated agriculture, together with more yield stability. The demand for irrigation will be especially focused in semi-arid regions supporting a large population, such as the Mediterranean basin and the Indo-Gangetic plain of northern India and Pakistan. The 'hot/warm semi-arid' agro-climatic zone is the one projected most to expand in relative proportion as a consequence of climate change brought about by the increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration. Irrigation in semi-arid climates is a major cause of secondary salinisation (that due to human activity) which already affects 1 ha in five of the irrigated lands. Increased demand for irrigation in semi-arid climates, as a result of both population increase and climate change, will tend to increase the extent of secondary salinisation. Any increase in the extent of secondary salinisation could be offset by positive effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on crop yield per unit area and per unit input of water. In protected environments, or where CO2 is the only experimental variable, elevated CO2 usually enhances plant growth and water-use-efficiency in the short-term and can also do so in the longer term. However, for crop production in the field world-wide, elevated CO2 per se is not a factor that can be viewed separately from the climate change that it will bring about. Neither the anticipated 'CO2-fertilisation' nor the 'water-use-efficiency' benefits to the plant of elevated CO2 is certain to outweigh the climatic effects of elevated CO2 on temperature, water availability and evaporative demand. Climate change is expected to cause a net increase in the proportion of land classed as semi-arid. Raised temperatures may benefit some crops in some places but disadvantage others through increased evapotranspiration and thermal damage. Increased water-use-efficiency may not reduce leaf salt concentration in a saline environment. Buffering and feedback effects in both agricultural and ecological systems conspire to moderate or even to confound the anticipated gains in net assimilation and water-use-efficiency found in experimental systems. Elevated CO2 may not, therefore, provide the anticipated decrease in water-use, decrease in leaf salt concentration, and increase in fixed carbon available for re-allocation: factors that might enhance crop performance under salinity stress. If these benefits are not realised then elevated atmospheric CO2 will exacerbate rather than moderate the problems of secondary salinity in agriculture.","Acclimation; Atmosphere circulation models; Canopy transpiration; Carbon allocation; Crop production models; Elevated CO2; Global climate change; Irrigation; Leaf temperature; Photosynthesis; Salinity; Salt uptake; Scaling effects; Stomatal conductance; Water-use-efficiency","climate change; crop production; prediction; salinity",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0344527924

The main objective of this project is the development and refinement of a venturi supported exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) system for a turbocharged and intercooled heavy-duty (HD) diesel engine enabling map controlled cooled EGR rates which are high enough to achieve future low NO x emission standards at acceptable fuel consumption level. In addition to EGR, further technologies have been investigated, which may be required to meet future exhaust emission standards. As a result of these investigations it was found that for EURO 3 standards (NOx / PM = 5/0.1 g/kWh in the new european steady state cycle - ESC) cooled EGR alone leads to the required NOx reduction without worsening fuel consumption from EURO 2 levels. However, for meeting indicated EURO 4 standards (NO x / PM = 3/0.1 g/kWh in new european transient cycle - ETC), the use of a particulate trap will most probably be required with today's diesel fuel qualities in spite of only modest increase of soot due to EGR. Therefore, two different particulate filter systems as potential candidates have been tested, and their pros and cons compared. INCREASINGLY STRINGENT exhaust emission regulations, which are expected to come into force around the turn of the century and thereafter worldwide in industrialized countries will require NOx and particulate emisson standards to be reduced by up to 60% from today's (1998) levels, see Fig. 1. To meet these future emission standards, the application of new technologies including exhaust gas aftertreatment systems will be indispensable, especially in view of maintaining or even improving the thermal efficiency of HD diesel engines. Two different routes for meeting the future european standards are currently under discussion, Fig. 2. The application of SCR systems using urea-water solution as a NOx reducing agent (SCR = selective catalytic reduction) is assessed as the most effective NOx reduction technology in the long range /1,2,3,4/, with the benefit of allowing combustion to be optimized for best fuel efficiency and lowest particulates. However, logistics for urea-water solution is a prerequisite, and on vehicles space for dosage system, urea tank, SCR catalyst and a modified exhaust muffler must be foreseen. Furthermore, durability and on-board-diagnostic (OBD) issues of the system need to be solved. Alternatively, fig. 2 also suggests that cooled Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) is offering a similar NOx reduction potential as does the SCR approach. Only moderate EGR rates would be necessary to meet EURO 3 standards with fuel consumption being equal to EURO 2 level and with minor effects on particulates /5,6,7/, whereas for EURO 4 at current status of development the use of a soot trap for reducing particulates seems to be a must due to the higher EGR rate requirements. In either case, a variety of potential problems have to be investigated and solved before EGR can be accepted in the heavy-duty diesel engine environment. More specific, major concerns are related to the durability of EGR components, EGR control requirements for transients, engine fouling (EGR cooler, intake ducts), and increased wear due to increased soot-in-oil and/or accelerated oil degradation. In general, brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is of utmost importance to the truck user, and in the future it is expected to be improved continuously. Conducive measures, already in use today on a variety of engines, are the application of multi valve (3V &amp; 4V) cylinder heads instead of two-valve heads, the use of fuel injection systems with increased fuel pressures in conjunction with reduced swirl levels, improved lube oil control, and the use of electronic engine management, especially for injection timing. Thus, fuel consumption for a given NOx level could be improved by up to 5 %. However, the magnitude of improvement depends also on the type of the test cycle. The change of the european certification test cycle /8/ from the current 13-Mode ECE R49 to the new 13-Mode ACEA/OICA (or new european steady state cycle - ESC) for EURO 3 and finally to the FIGE transient test (or european transient cycle - ETC) for EURO 4, as shown in Fig. 3, makes the assessment of test cycle fuel consumption and emission results more complicated due to the different load/speed operating modes and weightings factors as well as due to transient effects. The influence of the various test cycles on emissions and fuel consumption of a given EURO 2 engine is shown in Fig. 4. For NOx emissions being nearly at the same level (approx. 6.5 g/kWh) for all three test cycles, particulates and cycle fuel consumption decrease in the ESC due to the higher load factor and operation shifted to the mid speed range in this cycle, whereas in the ETC both fuel consumption and particulates increase, mainly as a result of transient operation. In view of this background and the development directions discussed previously, a joint research project named EFFLED (EFFicient Low Emission Diesel, EUREKA No. 1593) was initiated by AVL List GmbH in cooperation with companies DAF Trucks N.V., Serck Heat Transfer, Robert Bosch GmbH, and the Community of the City of Rotterdam. The main objective of this project is the development and refinement of a venturi supported EGR system for a turbocharged and air/air intercooled HD diesel engine enabling map controlled cooled EGR with EGR rates high enough to achieve the NOx emission levels required beyond 2000 at competitive fuel consumption level. Since with current diesel fuel qualities particulates inevitably tend to increase with the required high EGR rates, also the use of particulate trap oxidizers is considered within the EFFLED project. In the following sections, achievements of the still ongoing project are presented, with emphasis on both, the EGR system and its performance, and the behaviour of two different particulate trap systems being envisaged for future field operations of the engine, which finally is to be built into a DAF container vehicle and operated within the Community Vehicle Fleet of the City of Rotterdam.

For demonstration purpose, a trap protection strategy was developed with the aim to minimize the trap loading and thus the consequent fuel consumption penalty that can be observed for worst-case low speed driving scenarios. Measures to temporarily increase the exhaust gas temperature during inner-city driving and therefore to initiate the start of regeneration were successfully applied. MAJOR EFFORT IS BEING currently undertaken to develop and apply advanced aftertreatment systems to meet future proposed exhaust gas emission standards for passenger cars, LDT and HD diesel engines. Fig. 1 shows as an example the potential of HSDI engines with respect to achieving different US emission standards depending on vehicle weight. With advanced HSDI diesel engines, the emission standards for NOx and particulate could be met when using electronically controlled EGR and oxidation catalysts up to certain vehicle weights. Further improvements may be expected by new technology elements currently being pursued/1/such as improved fuel injection equipment, highly dynamic EGR systems, cooled EGR etc. However, since emission levels generally increase proportional to the vehicle weight, the introduction of advanced exhaust gas aftertreatment systems besides the oxidation catalysts will primarily be a necessity of heavier vehicles. In addition to the beneficial effects of improved fuel quality on emissions, possible strategies to reduce NOx and particulates (as the main pollutants in diesel exhaust) are summarized in Fig.2. By the application of electronically controlled EGR together with oxidation catalyst and the further improvement of the combustion process, in some cases the legislative emission targets could be met. However, as emission standards of NOx and particulate will be tightened further in the future, additional measures besides in-cylinder control and oxidation catalyst will be needed. Both particulate trap system and DENOx catalyst are seriously considered as additional strategies to reduce NO x and particulates/2/. In order to meet the fictitious emission targets, basically two routes may be adopted: Reduction of particulate emissions to the target level by measures on the engine (e.g. fuel injection with high pressure) and the application of a DENOx catalyst requested to offer high NOx efficiency (e.g. SCR or NOx storage catalyst with more than 60% reduction. However, such systems are not yet proven to offer such an high efficiency. Reduction of NOx emission to the target level by engine measures (e.g. cooled EGR with high rates) and application of particulate trap/3/. Which of these strategies could be applied as a serial solution in the future is a currently still open question. Considering only the use of particulate traps in the following, it is worth noting that it would be beneficial not only for achieving future standards or even current regulations/4/, but also as a retrofit solution to improve the environmental situation in inner cities-application to busses/5,6,7/and/or vans transporting goods-resulting in the reduction of visible and therefore disturbing black smoke. However, many problems must be overcome. Only particulate trap systems which are cost-effective and therefore self-regenerating without any external and costly measures and durable might be used on a large scale. One of the possible ways how to manage such an application is being described in this paper. © 1998 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.",,"Bandpass filters; Catalysts; Cerium; Cost effectiveness; Diesel engines; Efficiency; Environmental regulations; Exhaust gases; Exhaust systems (engine); Fuel additives; Fuel consumption; Fuel injection; Fuel storage; Laws and legislation; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Sintering; Trucks; Aftertreatment systems; Exhaust gas temperatures; Fuel injection equipments; Fuel-borne catalysts; NOx storage catalysts; Oxidation catalysts; Particulate trap regeneration; Protection strategy; Particulate emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072461502

Sludge is heated rapidly to reaction temperature (up to about 220°C) and quenched after 10 to 30 s. This process reduces the amount of biosolids requiring land disposal by increasing its biodegradability and dewaterability. Rapid thermal conditioning may be incorporated into a wastewater treatment plant where, combined with anaerobic digestion, it would reduce the quantity of biosolids requiring disposal, eliminate the need for polymer coagulant, improve dewaterability, increase methane production, and further reduce the concentration of pathogens. Also, the odor problem associated with traditional thermal conditioning processes is largely minimized. Pilot scale equipment was used to assess the process and provide design parameters for scale-up. Introduction of the process into an existing municipal wastewater treatment plant was then evaluated using the Wards Island Water Pollution Control Plant of New York City as an example. Two alternative flow sheets are shown together with preliminary engineering designs.

The resonance Raman spectra have most of their Raman intensity in features that may be assigned as fundamentals, overtones, and combination bands of three Franck-Condon active vibrational modes (the nominal C-I stretch, the nominal CCC bend, and the nominal CCI bend) for the trans and gauche conformations of 1-iodopropane. The resonance Raman and absorption cross sections of the trans and gauche conformations of 1-iodopropane were simulated using a simple model and time-dependent wave packet calculations. The results of the simulations were used in conjunction with the vibrational normal-mode coefficients to find the short-time photodissociation dynamics of trans and gauche conformers of 1-iodopropane in terms of internal coordinate changes. The trans and gauche conformers display significantly different Franck-Condon region photodissociation dynamics, which indicates that the C-I bond breaking is conformational dependent. In particular, there are large differences in the trans and gauche short-time photodissociation dynamics for the torsional motion (xGBx) about the GB carbon-carbon bond and the GBC angle (where C=α-carbon atom attached to the iodine atom, B=β-carbon atom attached to the α-carbon atom.

The major differences in the trans and gauche A-band short-time photodissociation dynamics can be mostly explained by the position of the C-I bond in the trans and gauche conformers relative to the plane of the three carbon atoms of the n-propyl group of 1-iodopropane. © 1998 American Institute of Physics.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0000348759

There are about 400,000 scooters in the city, and the number will not significantly decrease for several years. In order to manage the pollution caused by scooter emissions, many new catalytic instruments and additives were developed. In this paper, the effect of two new lubricants on the emission of scooter exhaust particulate matter was evaluated using gas chromatography/mass spectrometer (GC/MS), in vitro Salmonella/microsomal assay and the in vivo mouse micronucleus assay. The purpose was to learn if these new lubricants could have the ability to reduce the exhausts of particulate matter, and decrease the mutagenicity of exhaust particles. The domestic Jinniao (TN36L) vehicle was chosen as the test vehicle. The results showed that the two new lubricants reduced the emission of scooter exhaust particulate matter, including the quantity of particulate matter and the organic substances adsorbed onto the particles. Compared with the control oil, the two new lubricants reduced the emission of particulate matter by 33% and 36%. When using the two new lubricants, only 20 and 23 kinds of compounds were identified separately in the organic extracts of the exhaust particulate matter by GC/MS, while 45 kinds of compounds were detected in the organic extracts of the exhaust particulate matter when the control oil was used. Mutagenicities of the extracts of scooter exhaust particulate matter were significantly reduced when the two new lubricants were used, including the number of histidine-independent colonies over the background in TA98 with and without S9 mix in the Salmonella test (F2 sample); and the frequencies of bone marrow micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes in the mouse micronucleus assay (both F1 and F2 samples). These results seem to indicate that these new lubricants can effectively reduce the pollution of scooter exhaust particulate.","GC/MS; Lubricant; Micronucleus assay; Mutagenicity; Salmonella; Scooter exhaust particulate matter","lubricating agent; air pollution; article; china; exhaust gas; motorcycle; mutagenicity; nonhuman; particulate matter; priority journal; salmonella; Animals; China; Lubrication; Mice; Micronucleus Tests; Mutagenicity Tests; Mutagens; Salmonella typhi; Vehicle Emissions; Salmonella",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032507620

Various candidate fuel preparation concepts for lean hydrogen combustion with and without fuel/air premixing have been evaluated in a generic can type combustor at Pratt and Whitney Canada (PWC). Significant reduction in NOx emissions at simulated representative engine conditions has been achieved. Two concepts were then selected for further investigation in a research type combustion chamber which represents a typical 60° sector of a modern annular combustor. A test rig has been built by MTU especially for these tests. Steady state testing is being performed at Daimler-Benz Aerospace. Further tests to study the transient behaviour have been conducted by United Technologies Research Centre (UTRC). In addition, kinetic modelling was performed at Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Luft-und Raumfahrt (DLR) and PWC to provide a useful design tool for low-NOx hydrogen combustors. © 1997 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.",,"Combustion; Combustors; Computer simulation; Fuels; Hydrogen; Kinetic modelling; Aircraft engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032036108

Possible relaxation mechanisms considered include proton-proton and 13C-proton interactions. The influence of depyritization on relaxation parameters is estimated. Depyritization prolongs the T1H relaxation time constant by about five times. However, depyritization has no significant influence on relaxation in the rotating frame (&lt;5%). The probable explanation is that there is a certain motion of structural units with spectral density in the kHz region, which averages dipolar interactions between protons and pyrite. The repetition delay is found to be 150 ms for kerogen concentrate and 1-2 s for depyritized kerogen concentrate. The favourable value of contact time is identical for both samples, i.e., 1 ms. At the same time there are no significant changes observed in the CP/ MAS spectra of Aleksinac oil shale kerogen due to depyritization treatment, except for a small band (≈60 ppm) assigned to alcoholic groups which appeared as a result of the partial reduction of carbonyl groups. Use of the pyrite-containing B6 sample in solid-state NMR investigations is found to be more favourable because of its shorter T1H relaxation time and, consequently, shorter (by a factor of about five) experimental time. © 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The ISC model is currently the most popular dispersion model approved for use by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). A new dispersion model, the Fritz- Zwicke Model (C), has been developed by the authors to more accurately predict the ambient concentration downwind from a pollutant emission source. Both models are based upon the Gaussian diffusion equations; however, the parameters of the Gaussian model are applied differently in each. The ultimate goal of this project is to have the Fritz-Zwicke Model (C) approved by EPA Region VI for future use in the regulation of air pollution from agricultural operations, including cotton gins.",,"air; cotton; ginning; model; pollution; regulations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032449868

Also, we compile data on new facilities and proposed projects that are in the planning or permitting stage. Based on this information, we then provide a picture of the maturing commercial hazardous waste management industry. Our coverage of 1997 trends and changes include the 50 US states, and District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, Canada, and Mexico. The amount of information available regarding hazardous waste management facilities in Mexico remains limited. Also, the regulatory climate in Mexico is still evolving, making it difficult to stay completely attuned to the hazardous waste market. Hopefully, as the effects of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and other multinational agreements begin to take full effect, the management of hazardous waste in Mexico should become more routine.",,"annual review; waste facility; waste management; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0032443879

But, a report on ""Population Change, Resources, and the Environment"" indicated that high levels of resource consumption in developed countries are a problem also, as are the complex environmental consequences of rapid population growth in developing countries. Global population is expected to include at least another 2 billion people by the mid-21st century. This growth will occur mostly in countries that lack the resources to invest in sound environmental policies and that may not adopt economic growth with little environmental impact. Additional population requires additional food, water, and shelter. The links between the environment and population include social structures, political systems, and lifestyles. Population is increasing the fastest in countries with the least efficient food production and distribution systems. Access to safe drinking water is constrained by poverty, poor infrastructure, and pollution of waterways and groundwater. A major share of economic growth will occur in cities. Population shifts to cities will create demand for health care and education, and encroach on surrounding farmland. Global marine fish stocks are being depleted. Logging and agriculture threaten forest resources. The report stresses that government policies that minimize the environmental impact of humans should promote recycling, eliminate subsidies that distort environmental costs of scarce resources, and implement better forest and fishery management.
