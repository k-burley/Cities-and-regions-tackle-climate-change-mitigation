A Mississippian aged CO2-H2S reservoir in LaBarge Field, Wyoming, USA is an ideal study site to investigate mineral and fluid reactions related to gaseous H2S and CO2. We conducted two reaction path models based on mineralogical, fluid, gas, and stable isotope compositional data to discern the role of CO2 influx upon the generation of H2S through thermochemical sulphate reduction (TSR). We discriminate between two models-one in which TSR is triggered by temperature at a given burial depth and one where TSR is triggered by ingress of CO2. The reaction path model based upon burial-controlled TSR and later CO2 influx is consistent with mineralogical observations and stable isotope measurements from drill cores. The models show that CO2 influx leads to calcite precipitation which is only limited by the calcium concentration in the fluid. This modelling approach is useful in constraining the timing of fluid flux in the reservoir and gives further insight into the mineralogical consequences of the gas, water, and rock interactions occurring in the reservoir. In terms of geologic co-sequestration this implies that the addition of CO2 into a reducing carbonate system can result in calcite precipitation, instead of anhydrite as previously thought. Furthermore, it is only limited by the availability of Ca2+ and will therefore not diminish the amount of H2S in the system. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Calcite; Carbon dioxide; Core drilling; Isotopes; Sulfur compounds; Calcite precipitation; Calcium concentration; Chemical interactions; Compositional data; Reaction path modeling; Rock interaction; Sequestration of CO2; Sulphate reduction; Lanthanum compounds; calcite; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbonate system; chemical reaction; hydrogen sulfide; Mississippian; modeling; precipitation (chemistry); reduction; reservoir; stable isotope; water-rock interaction; La Barge Creek; United States; Wyoming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070820479

Our study attempted to address the following objectives: To measure indoor infiltration factor (Finf of PM2.5 from outdoor fine particles and to determine the building parameters that modifies the indoor PM2.5. We collected indoor/outdoor 1-min PM2.5. from 50 daycare environments. We noted high indoor and outdoor concentrations of fine particles due to the presence of regional haze pollution. Indoor and outdoor fine particle concentrations are significantly highest for daycares located near highways while indoor to outdoor ratios were significantly lower for air-conditioning use in daycares. Mean Finf SD of 0.650.19 in daycare rooms which are naturally ventilated and lower Finf SD values of 0.46-0.22 for those that are air-conditioned. The penetration coefficients and air exchange rates were higher in naturally ventilated daycares (0.78 vs 0.61 and 1.47 vs 0.86 h-1 respectively).

This study assesses the potential environmental impacts of IH2 process fuels manufactured in Ontonagon, Michigan, to determine their environmental impacts and if these manufactured fuels will meet Renewable Fuel Standards (RFS) requirements. The energy return on investment (EROI) is also calculated for comparison to other renewable fuels. Methods: A cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment was conducted using regional forestry, timber harvest, and transportation data from the region. Regional geographic data was used to determine service areas that may provide woody biomass. The service areas were then developed into inventory data based upon the type and distribution of potential woody biomass feedstocks. Survey data from loggers in the region were used to ensure that harvest types were allocated in accordance with regional activity. Remaining inventory items were derived from existing data in the literature or existing life cycle inventory databases. This study uses a functional unit of one megajoule of gasoline or diesel produced using the IH2 process and assessed several environmental indicators as well as EROI. Results and discussion: Fuels produced generate approximately 88% less greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to petroleum fuels given RFS assumptions. Manufacturing and transportation of feedstocks accounts for 92.19% of energy used in production giving a calculated EROI of 4.19 and 4.31 per kilogram of diesel and gasoline, respectively. Pessimistic estimates of soil organic carbon (SOC) loss result in GHG emissions that are approximately 83% lower. If a 1:0.5 displacement ratio of IH2 fuels is considered, the GHG emissions are about 76% lower without SOC loss and 66% lower with. This study demonstrates that while environmental impacts and EROI are sensitive to site selection and SOC estimates, there is a sufficient GHG emission reduction such that IH2 fuels are capable of meeting regulatory requirements. Conclusions: Fuels produced at the facility result in a reduction in GHG emissions, but better site selection may result in less fuel being used in transportation. Reducing the quantity of electricity needed in n-th–generation facilities would also reduce environmental impacts while improving the EROI. The energy mix used to supply IH2 facilities should also be considered during the planning process. Finally, future research may be needed to ensure feedstocks recovered from logging operations match expectations. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biofuels; Carbon footprint; Diesel; Energy return on investment; Gasoline; Hydropyrolysis; Woody biomass","biodiesel; gasoline; organic carbon; petroleum derivative; Article; biofuel production; biomass; calculation; carbon footprint; chemical reaction; controlled study; data base; energy; energy return on investment; environmental factor; environmental impact assessment; forest; geography; harvest; integrated hydropyrolysis and hydroconversion; investment; life cycle assessment; Michigan; nonhuman; priority journal; renewable energy; soil; standard; timber; traffic and transport; wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064243231

In this framework, this paper explores the efficacy of applying different scenarios, for reducing construction costs of new nearly zero energy multi-family houses in a life cycle perspective. Conversely to the standard cost-optimal approach, a real Italian case study building was chosen. Alternative and unconventional combinations of solutions for envelope and technical systems were adopted. Calculations were performed in two Italian cities (Rome and Turin). Three types of analysis were developed thermal comfort, energy performance and financial calculation. Results of the thermal analysis show that the installation of active cooling to prevent summer overheating can be avoided by applying low-cost passive strategies. All the proposed low-cost scenarios (4 alternative scenarios in Rome and 5 in Turin)reached the highest grade of energy performance, with a reduction of the non-renewable primary energy consumption up to 46% compared to the base case in Rome and 18% in Turin. From the economic perspective, all the scenarios in the two climate zones allow both reductions in the construction costs, up to 26% in Rome and 15% in Turin, and a Net Present Value after 50 years up to 163 €/m2 in Rome and 158 €/m2 in Turin. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy technologies; Construction cost; Life cycle cost; Nearly zero energy buildings","Artificial life; Construction; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Life cycle; Thermal comfort; Thermoanalysis; Building energy; Construction costs; Economic perspective; Indoor environmental quality; Life cycle perspectives; Lifecycle costs; Optimal approaches; Primary energy consumption; Zero energy buildings; building; cost analysis; energy market; energy planning; household energy; life cycle analysis; residential energy; standard (reference); Italy; Lazio; Piedmont [Italy]; Roma [Lazio]; Rome; Torino [Piedmont]; Turin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066280175

As adaptation moves from theory to implementation, there is a need for positive case studies to use as benchmarks. Building from literature on actionable science this paper presents one such positive case—the development of a hydropower and reservoir decision-support tool. The focus of this history is on the multiple phases of interaction (and non-interaction) between researchers and a semidefined community of stakeholders. The lessons presented from the Integrated Forecast and Reservoir Management (INFORM) system project stress that collaborations between managers and researchers were crucial to the success of the project by building knowledge networks, which could outlast formal processes, and by incorporating policy preferences of end users into the model. The history also provides examples of how even successful collaborative projects do not always follow the usual expectations for coproduced science and shows that, even when those guidelines are followed, external circumstances can threaten the adoption of research products. Ultimately, this paper argues for the importance of building strong knowledge networks alongside more formal processes—like those in boundary organizations—for effective collaborative engagement. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.",,"benchmarking; climate change; decision support system; forecasting method; governance approach; hydroelectric power; water planning; water use efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073540173

However, the relatively weak field enhancement resulted from large optical losses associated with aluminum nanostructures in combination with the difficulties in controlling the emission polarization pose as a challenge for SH enhancement and tuning. In this paper, we show that the SH emission of aluminum nanostructures can be efficiently enhanced with the polarization properties simultaneously tunable by using metal-insulator-metal (MIM) nanostructures, constituting of Al cross nanoantenna arrays on top of Al mirrors with a SiO2 spacing layer. Specifically, femtosecond laser beam with a linear polarization parallel to one arm illuminates on the structure while the orthogonal arms were physically modified by the laser-induced photothermal reshaping technique to control the SH radiation by the plasmonic resonances. Under the resonance at the SH wavelength, we observed one order of magnitude larger emission enhancement compared to that at the off-resonant condition. Interestingly, the polarization states can be well manipulated simultaneously by controlling the resonances of the orthogonal arms. The enhanced SH conversion and tunable polarization states pave the way for the development of nonlinear optical sources and advanced functional metasurfaces. © 2019 Optical Society of America.",,"Laser beams; Metal insulator boundaries; MIM devices; Nanostructures; Nonlinear optics; Plasmonics; Polarization; Semiconductor insulator boundaries; Silica; Emission enhancement; Linear polarization; Metal insulator metals; Plasmonic nanostructures; Plasmonic resonances; Polarization properties; Resonant condition; Second-harmonic emission; Aluminum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073631807

The proposed model based on interval two-stage credibility-constrained full-infinite programming (ITFP) method and Gaussian diffusion model. The method was integrated by interval two-stage stochastic programming (ITSP), fuzzy credibility constrained programming (FCCP) and interval full-infinite programming (IFIP), which can tackle multiple uncertainties in terms of probability distribution, possibility distribution, crisp intervals and functional intervals. In addition, Gaussian diffusion model can be used to predict pollutant concentrations under different wind velocities. Then, IEM-UGOM was applied for the administration of industry-environment system (IES) in Yulin City, a typical ecologically vulnerable coal-dependent city in China, by considering 7 key industries, 3 pollutants, 5 periods, 7 credibility satisfaction levels and 4 wind velocity levels. Meanwhile, retreatment efficiency and transfer factors are considered as well. Results of system benefits, production reduction, pollutants excess emission amounts and penalties, pollutants retreatment amounts and costs under various credibility satisfaction levels and wind velocities are generated.

Then, future CCSM4 projections under high and low emission scenarios were downscaled and compared with CCSM4 projections. Observations showed a marked upward trend in temperature and precipitation since 1979. The spatiotemporal distribution of temperature and precipitation in the TP were well represented by the reanalysis data. Downscaled simulations of ERA-Interim and CCSM4 were able to reproduce the spatial distribution of temperature in the TP; however, a cold bias was apparent in the central and western regions. Compared with precipitation observations, the downscaled CCSM4 simulation showed markedly different precipitation trends. Future climate projections indicated that temperatures will increase markedly in the TP, especially under the high emission RCP8.5 scenario. Under RCP4.5, both CCSM4 and the downscaled simulation projected a 1.5 °C increase in annual temperatures during 2006–2050, while under RCP8.5, the downscaled simulation projected an increase greater than 2.5 °C, and CCSM4 projected an increase of 2.0 °C.

Here, we present a potentiostatic pulse-electrodeposition of high-aspect-ratio CuxAuy nanowire arrays (NWAs) as high-performance electrocatalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The surface electronic structure related to the Cu:Au ratio in the CuxAuy NWAs could be facilely modulated by controlling the electrodeposition potential and the as-fabricated CuxAuy NWAs could be directly used as the catalytic electrode for the CO2RR. The morphology of the high-aspect-ratio nanowire array significantly lowers the onset potential of the alcohol formation due to the diffusion-induced enhancement of the local pH and CO concentration near the nanowire surface. Besides, the properly adjusted surface electronic structure of the CuxAuy NWA enables the adsorption of CO and facilitates the subsequent CO reduction to ethanol via the C-C coupling pathway. Owing to the synergistic effect of morphology and electronic structure, the optimized CuxAuy NWA selectively reduces CO2 to ethanol at low potentials of −0.5–−0.7 V vs. RHE with a highest Faradaic efficiency of 48%. This work demonstrates the feasibility to optimize the activity and selectivity of the Cu-based electrocatalysts toward multicarbon alcohols for the CO2RR via simultaneous adjustment of the electronic structure and morphology of the catalysts. © 2019 Science Press and Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences","CO2 reduction; Cu-based catalyst; Electrocatalysis; Nanowire array; Selectivity","Aspect ratio; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrodeposition; Electrodes; Electrolytic reduction; Electronic structure; Ethanol; Nanowires; Selective catalytic reduction; CO2 reduction; Cu-based catalyst; Electrochemical reductions; Electrodeposition potential; Nanowire arrays; Potentiostatic pulse electrodeposition; Structure and morphology; Surface electronic structures; Morphology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063762907

In this paper, the pulverized char combustion characteristics and NOx emission characteristics in the air conditions, the local oxygen-enriched air conditions in the CFB and the overall oxygen-enriched air conditions were studied. The results show that when the primary air oxygen concentration increased from 21.0% to 24.6% and to 28.2%, the ratio of fuel-nitrogen converted to nitrogen in the CFB increased from 39.7% to 45.0% and to 50.8%, respectively. This finding indicates that the preheating process in the CFB was one of the important reasons why the preheating combustion technology could significantly reduce NOx emissions. Compared with the air combustion conditions, the NO emissions decreased to almost half of the original emissions when only the primary air oxygen concentration increased. On this basis, the NO emissions increased slightly when the air oxygen concentration was also increased in the DFC. Under these conditions, the variations in the char combustion efficiency were consistent with the variations in the temperature distribution.

Surprisingly from a negligible level in early 2000s, the country has also become a global leader in solar PV utilization. In the past two decades of renewable energy development, wind power dominated before 2012, while annual solar PV installation quickly caught up afterwards. This article explains the solar PV trajectory as China followed the comparative advantage of wind power and solar PV, contingent upon their relative costs, for achieving renewable energy goals. We further explore why China with a tradition of central planning could approach the least-cost, market-oriented roadmap. Several factors were effective in enabling the “comparative advantage strategy” without central planning but mainly bottom-up decision making, including cost-conscious state-owned electric grid corporations, policy and goal evolution by implementation selection, and constrained solar lobby.

The results indicate that (1) China's provincial energy efficiency is olive-shaped, and there is a significant spatial imbalance. (2) Most central provinces and a small number of eastern and western provinces need to adopt a one-way breakthrough path for their weak links. Most western provinces should adopt a step-by-step progressive or leap-forward path to improve energy efficiency.

During this event, vertical profiles of particulate matter (PM) and meteorological parameters within the lower troposphere (0–1000 m) were collected using a tethered balloon. This study assessed the evolution of the PM2.5 profile with the planetary boundary layer (PBL) structure and the effects of fog on the PM2.5 concentration. The results showed the following: (1) At the surface, the average diurnal variation in Aitken mode, accumulation mode and coarse mode particles had bimodal patterns before fog formation and was mainly influenced by diurnal variation in the mixing level depth (MLD). The aerosol number concentrations decreased remarkably, and the PM2.5 was strongly scavenged from 150 μg/m3 to 45 μg/m3 during the fog process. (2) In the vertical direction, the PM2.5 distribution was affected by the PBL height and the vertical fog structure. At 05:00 LT (local time) (i.e., early morning before the fog event), the PM2.5 concentration was slightly higher in the stable layer (260 μg/m3) than in the residual layer (200 μg/m3). At 14:00 LT (haze period), PM2.5 was well mixed below 500 m, with a concentration of 310 μg/m3. After 20:00 LT, when fog formed, PM2.5 was scavenged from the surface to the upper layers, and the scavenging height was controlled by the fog top height. (3) The vertical development of fog was promoted by turbulent mixing and radiation cooling at the fog top. Turbulent mixing enhanced the particle scavenging efficiency of fog droplets by the collision-coalescence process. The PM2.5 scavenging height was corresponded to the turbulence height. Therefore, turbulence development in the fog was the essential dynamic factor driving PM2.5 reduction. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Planetary boundary layer structure; PM2.5 profile; Radiation fog; Scavenging of PM2.5; Turbulence","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Mixing; Shock tubes; Turbulence; Turbulent flow; Coarse mode particles; Meteorological parameters; Number concentration; Planetary boundary layers; PM2.5 concentration; PM2.5 profile; Radiation fog; Yangtze river delta; Fog; boundary layer; concentration (composition); diurnal variation; fog; haze; particulate matter; radiative forcing; rural area; scavenging (chemistry); turbulent mixing; Article; bioaccumulation; China; concentration (parameter); environmental impact assessment; fog; human; humidity; meteorology; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; rural area; scavenging system; surface area; Anhui; China; Yangtze Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066842521

The carbon emissions of the road transportation industry in six Asia-Pacific countries (Australia, Canada, China, India, Russia, and the United States) accounts for more than 50% of this in the global transportation industry. Therefore, it is of great significance to study driving factors of carbon emissions of the road transportation industry in six Asia-Pacific countries for controlling global carbon emissions. In this paper, the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) decomposition method is adopted to analyze driving factors on carbon emissions of the road transportation industry in six Asia-Pacific countries from 1990 to 2016. The results show that carbon emissions of the road transportation industry in these six Asia-Pacific countries was 2961.37 million tons in 2016, with an increase of 84.43% compared with those in 1990. The economic output effect and the population size effect have positive driving influences on carbon emissions of the road transportation industry, in which the economic output effect is still the most important driving factor. The energy intensity effect and the transportation intensity effect have different influences on driving carbon emissions of the road transportation industry for these six Asia-Pacific Countries. Furthermore, the carbon emissions coefficient effect has a relatively small influence. Hence, in order to effectively control carbon emissions of the road transportation industry in these six Asia-Pacific countries, it is necessary to control the impact of economic developments on the environment, to reduce energy intensity by promoting the conversion of road transportation to rail and water transportation, and to lower the carbon emissions coefficient by continuously improving vehicle emission standards and fuel quality. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; Driving factors; Logarithmic mean Divisia index; Road transportation industry","Carbon; Economic and social effects; Motor transportation; Population statistics; Quality control; Roads and streets; Asia-pacific countries; Carbon emissions; Decomposition methods; Divisia index; Driving factors; Global carbon emission; Road transportation industry; Transportation industry; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075583694

However, controlling the amount of growth is costly. Therefore, in this Article, we focus on urban warming and investigate whether climate-conscious urban growth planning (CUGP), that is, urban growth with the same magnitude but optimized spatial arrangements, brings significant mitigation effects. First, the classical spatial multiobjective land-use optimization (SMOLA) model is improved by integrating the spatially, diurnally, and compositionally varying associations between land-use and their warming impacts. We then solve the improved model using the nondominated genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) to generate urban growth plans with minimal warming impacts and minimal cost of change without reducing the amount of urban growth. Results show that climate-conscious urban growth brings 33.3 ± 4.6% less warming impacts as compared to unplanned urban growth in Shenzhen, China, and suggest a compact and spatially equalized development pattern. This study provides evidence that spatial planning tools such as the CUGP can help mitigate human impacts on the environment. Meanwhile, the improved SMOLA model could be applied to balance urban development and other environmental consequences such as air pollution.

As a case study of Wuhan, this paper identified the statistical regularity between PM2.5 concentration and adsorption of representative trees through field sampling and measurement, simulated the influence of different afforestation plans on PM2.5 concentration based on Geographic Information System (GIS), judged the significance of the difference of the plans, and proposed a greening distribution strategy. The results show that different forest layouts had no significant impact on PM2.5 in the administrative region, and the concentration reduction rate was only 1-2%. Targeted planting of trees in heavily polluted areas in the city center would have achieved better air quality improvement, with a reduction rate of 3-5%. In Wuhan construction areas, trees should be planted to increase the forest coverage rate to 30%. The edge of the urban metropolitan development zone needs to be strengthened with trees to form a forest belt 10 km-20 km wide, with a forest coverage rate of at least 60%. In general, the capability of trees to reduce PM2.5 concentration is weak. The fundamental way to improve air quality is to reduce emissions; planting trees is only an auxiliary measure. More ecological forest functions should be considered in city-wide afforestation distribution. © 2019 by the authors.

Their tighter integration decreases not only the emissions, but also the energy consumption of buildings and transportation. Energy integration and interactions between buildings and vehicles are dependent on the type of building, vehicle, and renewable energy system, as well as the local climatic conditions. The current academic literature does not provide a systematic analysis of this topic. In the study, different energy management systems and advanced energy control strategies have been formulated to study such interactions both from a building and a vehicle perspective. Furthermore, technical solutions have been systematically reviewed in terms of the enhancement of energy interaction capabilities, in particular from the standpoint of renewable energy systems, energy/fuel charging facilities, and control strategies. Assessment criteria employed in the review of solutions include grid interaction, annual operational cost, annual net CO2 emissions, and annual matching capability. The literature review identifies several technical challenges that need further consideration such as capacity expansion and power fluctuation of the electric grid, low efficiency of heat recovered from electricity generation, and depreciation of vehicles.

Findings: The results indicated that both information quality and service quality affect trust in community, whereas both informational support and emotional support affect trust in other members. Both types of trust and privacy risk determine users’ sharing intention, which in turn affects sharing behaviour. Research limitations/implications: The results imply that service providers need to improve their community platforms and create a supportive climate in order to facilitate users’ trust and their knowledge sharing behaviour.

Now, an amorphous Ag-Bi-S-O decorated Bi0 catalyst derived from Ag0.95BiS0.75O3.1 nanorods by electrochemical pre-treatment was used for catalyzing eCO2RR, which exhibited a formate FE of 94.3 % with a formate partial current density of 12.52 mA cm−2 at an overpotential of only 450 mV. This superior performance was attributed to the attached amorphous Ag-Bi-S-O substance. S could be retained in the amorphous region after electrochemical pre-treatment only in samples derived from metal-S-O composites, and it would greatly enhance the formate selectivity by accelerating the dissociation of H2O. The existence of Ag would increase the current density, resulting in a higher local pH, which made the role of S in activating H2O more significantly and suppressed H2 evolution more effectively, thus endowing the catalyst with a higher formate FE at low overpotentials. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

An understanding of water use in Mongolian pine plantations is critical for effective vegetation restoration. To determine water sources in a Mongolian pine plantation, we investigated the stable isotopic ratios of δ18O and δD in precipitation, groundwater, in soil water in different soil layers, and in tree xylem at different tree ages along a precipitation gradient and in different micro-landforms. The results indicated that the main water sources for Mongolian pine were precipitation-derived shallow soil water in semi-humid regions and that the contribution proportion decreased with an increase in tree age. With reduced precipitation in semi-arid and arid regions, contribution of deep soil water to Mongolian pine water use gradually increased, and differences in soil water contribution among trees due to tree age also significantly increased. Water use patterns in trees planted in different micro-landforms (e.g. sand dune crest or inter-dune lowland) became more distinct as precipitation gradually decreased across humid to semiarid and arid regions. Moreover, Mongolian pine, including 15-, 20-, 25-, and 45-year-old trees, similar height and DBH without groundwater in semi-arid climate (in Ejin Horo banner), while trees planted in extremely arid climate (Linze) relied on irrigation for survival despite abundant and available groundwater at that study site. These results indicated that groundwater may be beyond reach to be a main water source for Mongolian pine trees. Soil water conditions determined the survival and sustainable growth of planted trees, especially at depths less than 1 m where soil layers were recharged mainly by precipitation. Although Mongolian pine exhibits strong ecological adaptability, a trait that makes it ideally-suited for controlling desertification in sandy regions of northern China, water stress, crown dieback, or even tree mortality are likely to occur under conditions of extremely low precipitation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Asian summer monsoon precipitation; Mongolian pine plantation; Sandy soils; Stable isotopes; Water extraction depth","Arid regions; Geomorphology; Groundwater; Isotopes; Landforms; Restoration; Soil moisture; Value engineering; Vegetation; Asian summer monsoons; Mongolian pine plantations; Sandy soils; Stable isotopes; Water extraction; Forestry; arid region; coniferous tree; desertification; dune; landform; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); sandy soil; semiarid region; shallow soil; soil water; stable isotope; summer; water depth; water uptake; Asia; China; Gansu; Linze; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068986492

Clay minerals such as montmorillonite processed with bacteria can imitate the microbial interactions occurring in more complex natural environmental media such as soil and atmospheric particulates. Here, we characterize OMs in multiple phases for bacteria-inoculated montmorillonite clay and atmospheric particulates collected in China. In addition to the traditional 13C cross-polarization magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (CPMAS NMR) experiments, this study, for the first time, applies both one- A nd two-dimensional comprehensive multiphase (CMP) NMR to these critical environmental issues. The CMP NMR experimental spectra show that the main OM components in these samples are aliphatics, carbohydrates, and aromatics. These CMP NMR spectra also reveal the biochemical interactions between microbes and clay minerals by identifying the metabolites. CMP NMR can further investigate the states, interfacial/surficial interactions, and dynamics at the molecular/atomic levels since diffusion/relaxation (T2)-edited experiments can distinguish OM with differing sizes and mobilities. Therefore, the mechanism at the atomic/molecular level for environmental biogeochemical interactions can be efficiently probed by CMP NMR experiments. This paper concludes that CMP NMR is a powerful and innovative tool for crucial environmental studies at the molecular/atomic scale, providing not only the composition, phase, and structural identifications but also the interfacial/surficial interaction dynamics involved in environmental geochemical processes.

Using the administrative job contract records of all graduates from Tsinghua University from 2005 to 2016, we find that air pollution significantly reduces the probability of elite graduates accepting job offers in a polluted city. Specifically, all else equal, if a city’s PM2.5 level increases by 10 μg/m3, the share of Tsinghua graduates choosing that city will decrease by 0.23 percentage point (9% of the mean value). This “crowding-out” effect is larger for master’s and doctoral graduates, but insignificant for undergraduates. A placebo test finds this effect does not exist for individuals who had signed a job contract prior to university admission, which strengthens our finding. Heterogeneity analysis indicates that males, students who grew up in cleaner provinces, and students graduating from school of the environment are more sensitive to air pollution.

A multi-dimensional framework is developed in this study to better understand the policies related to low carbon city development in China. These state-level policies are classified into six aspects: planning guidance, building energy conservation, industrial development regulation, energy industry development and energy mix, economic measures, and supervision measures. The evolution of these policies is examined in this study. Results show that national policies play a significant role in guiding low-carbon development of cities while the practicability of these national policies is improved. In addition, the development of low carbon city clusters is actively promoted by the Chinese government and linked to other strategic initiatives such as “The Belt and Road”.

Results showed that N addition promoted tree growth (stem increment), reduced soil microbial biomass carbon (C) and N in the Mongolian pine plantation, but did not affect those in the Simon poplar plantation, and these N addition effects were not interacted by P addition. P addition significantly increased microbial biomass C and N in the Simon poplar plantation. N addition elevated soil phosphatase activities and reduced net N mineralization rate, and these N addition effects were alleviated by simultaneous P addition in both plantations. N addition decreased soil labile inorganic P concentration in both plantations and elevated labile organic P in the Mongolian pine plantation, but only the decrease in labile inorganic P with N addition in the Mongolian pine plantation was counteracted by P addition. N addition significantly reduced soil pH, with a greater extent in the Mongolian pine plantation than in the Simon poplar plantation. Moreover, soil pH response explained most of the microbial and nutrient transformation response. Above results indicated that short-term N addition impacts on tree growth and soil microbial biomass were more strongly influenced by tree species identity than by P addition, while N addition effects on soil N and P transformations were strongly influenced by P addition. Drought resistance of trees and acid buffering capacity of soils are key traits influencing the short-term N addition impacts on the growth of trees and microorganisms in this semiarid region. © 2019","Nitrogen addition; Nutrient availability; Phosphorus addition; Pinus sylvestris var. mongolica; Populus simonii; Soil microbial biomass","Arid regions; Biomass; Forestry; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Soils; Value engineering; Nitrogen additions; Nutrient availability; Phosphorus addition; Pinus sylvestris; Populus simonii; Soil microbial biomass; Ecology; belowground biomass; buffering; coniferous tree; fertilizer application; forest soil; growth response; mineralization; nitrogen; nutrient availability; phosphorus; soil microorganism; soil property; Biomass; Forestry; Nitrogen; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Pinus Sylvestris; Pinus sylvestris; Populus simonii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068823376

Over the last two decades, China's severe air pollution has led atmospheric chemists to devote substantial efforts to investigate the contribution of carbonyl compounds to the observed phenomena. This study reviews the major findings with regard to the gas-phase atmospheric chemistry of carbonyls in China, including their chemical compositions, temporal and spatial distributions, source apportionments, photochemical formation mechanisms, and impact on tropospheric oxidative capacity, air quality, and human health. Extremely high levels of carbonyls have frequently been observed in China's most rapidly developing regions, such as the North China Plain, the Yangtze River Delta, and the Pearl River Delta, but observational data from other regions are relatively scarce. Primary emissions and photochemical formation are major sources of carbonyls. Alkenes, aromatics, and isoprene have been identified as major precursors on a national scale. In addition, an increasing number of studies has focused on the effects of carbonyls on O3 formation, radical chemistry, the formation of secondary organic aerosols, and human health. The photolysis of oxygenated volatile organic compounds was recognized as a dominant pathway to ROx production, which further influences O3 formation, mainly via HO2+NO or RO2+NO. Dicarbonyls (such as glyoxal and methylglyoxal) make important contributions to secondary organic aerosol formation via irreversible uptake by aqueous particles. Indoor and outdoor carbonyls often pose a significant threat to human health. This review also includes recommendations from the perspective of emissions, observations, photochemical formation mechanisms, and the effects of carbonyls to guide future research and provide scientific support for the formulation of mitigation policies to address photochemical air pollution. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbonyls; Human health; Ozone; Photochemical formation; Secondary organic aerosol","Aerosols; Air quality; Carbonyl compounds; Health; Health risks; Ozone; Photochemical forming; Photolysis; River pollution; Spatial distribution; Troposphere; Volatile organic compounds; Carbonyls; Chemical compositions; Human health; Photochemical air pollution; Photochemical formation; Secondary organic aerosols; Temporal and spatial distribution; Tropospheric chemistry; Atmospheric chemistry; alkene; carbonyl derivative; glyoxal; isoprene; methylglyoxal; ozone; volatile organic compound; aerosol formation; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbonyl compound; ozone; photochemistry; pollution exposure; public health; spatial distribution; temporal distribution; volatile organic compound; air pollution; air quality; atmosphere; chemical composition; circadian rhythm; gas chromatography; health hazard; high performance liquid chromatography; human; photochemistry; photooxidation; priority journal; Review; seasonal variation; secondary organic aerosol; China; Guangdong; North China Plain; Yangtze Delta; Zhujiang Delta",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069832993

Experiments were conducted based on a heavy chassis dynamometer, and a laboratory activity test as well as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS)test were applied to evaluate the changes of the aged CCRT catalyst. Results showed that the CCRT could reduce the CO by 71.5% and the total hydrocarbons (THC)by 88.9%, and meanwhile promote the oxidation of NO. However, the conversion rates for CO and THC dropped to 25.1% and 55.1%, respectively, after the CCRT was used for one year (~ 60,000 km), and the NO oxidation was also weakened. For particulate emissions, the CCRT could reduce 97.4% of the particle mass (PM)and almost 100% of the particle number (PN). The aging of the CCRT resulted in a reduced PM trapping efficiency but had no observable effect on the PN; however, it increased the proportion of nucleation mode particles. The activity test results indicated that the deterioration of the CCRT was directly relevant to the increase in the light-off temperatures of the catalyst for CO, C3H8 and NO2. In addition, the decreased concentrations of the active components Pt2+ and Pt4+ in the catalyst are also important factors in the CCRT deterioration. © 2019","Catalyzed continuously regenerating trap (CCRT); Deterioration; Diesel bus; Durability; Emissions","Catalysis; Catalysts; Deterioration; Diesel engines; Durability; Dynamometers; Emission control; Oxidation; Particles (particulate matter); X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Catalyzed diesel particulate filters; Continuously regenerating traps; Diesel bus; Diesel oxidation catalyst; Durability performance; Light-off temperatures; Nucleation mode particles; Trapping efficiencies; Particulate emissions; catalyst; concentration (composition); diesel; durability; emission control; oxidation; performance assessment; trap (equipment); carbon monoxide; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; analysis; catalysis; devices; evaluation study; exhaust gas; filtration; particulate matter; prevention and control; Carbon Monoxide; Catalysis; Filtration; Hydrocarbons; Nitrogen Oxides; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065833084

While we know that the costs associated with PM2.5-related health outcomes are not uniform geographically, a few researchers have considered the geographical variations in these costs because of a lack of high-resolution data for PM2.5 and population density. Satellite remote sensing provides highly precise, high-resolution data about how PM2.5 and population density vary spatially, which can be used to support detailed health-related assessments. In this study, we used high-resolution PM2.5 concentration and population density based on remote sensing data to assess the effects of PM2.5 on human health and the related economic costs in the Beijing– Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region in 2016 using exposure-response functions and the relationship between health and economic costs. The results showed that the PM2.5-related economic costs were unevenly distributed and as with the population density, the costs were mainly concentrated in urban areas. In 2016, the economic costs of PM2.5-related health endpoints amounted to 4.47% of the total gross domestic product in the BTH region. Of the health endpoints, the cost incurred by premature deaths accounted for more than 80% of the total economic costs associated with PM2.5. The results of this study provide new and detailed information that could be used to support the implementation of national and regional policies to reduce air pollution. © 2019 by the authors.

Therefore, it is important to evaluate the impact of these crop rotation systems on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Field experiments were conducted with three different rotation systems, and the DeNitrification–DeComposition (DNDC) model was applied to monitor and estimate crop yields and GHG emissions during three rice-upland crop rotational periods (from June 2013 to May 2016). Low methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions were observed in rice-Chinese milk vetch and single rice rotation systems. The simulated crop yields fit the observed data very well (d ' 0.80, EF ' 0.70) after the model was calibrated by adjusting the crop parameters. The model-simulated daily and annual CH4 emissions agreed well with the field measurements (d ' 0.7, EF = 0.41–0.98). The simulated N2O (d = 0.01–0.70, EF ' 0 or close to 0) of accumulated emissions and daily fluxes (d = 0.07–0.14, EF ' 0) showed low levels of accuracy with field observations. The GHG emissions in Shanghai rice paddy were different under various rotation systems, with the following order: single rice rotation system ' rice-Chinese milk vetch rotation system ' baseline rotation system of Shanghai paddy ' 1/3 (rice-Chinese milk vetch + single rice + rice-winter wheat rice-winter) rotation system ' rice-winter wheat rotation system under the same nitrogen loading. The DNDC was able to predict rice yields and GHG emissions under different crop rotation systems. The results provide positive reliable indications that crop rotation systems have the potential to reduce GHG emissions; e.g., the rice-Chinese milk vetch rotation system could mitigate the CH4 and N2O emissions.

The dynamic model shows the possible impacts of these policies on China's economic structure, carbon emissions, and social welfare from 2020 to 2030. Simulations show that a carbon tariff changes the structure of China's exports and promotes trade diversion from the USA to other countries and regions. A domestic carbon tax and subsidy policy can dampen the adverse impacts of carbon tariffs on trade.

Any novel strategy to make cement plants more efficient would increase the annual revenue while significantly reducing local and global emissions. In this paper, an energy audit in a cement plant (Kerman, Iran) is presented in order to introduce more viable potential solutions to push this industry towards a more sustainable status. Various parameters, such as temperature and system dimensions, were measured, and raw materials and product analyses were conducted. Then, using the measured and analyzed data, an energy balance analysis was performed. A novel framework based on a well-known global optimizer algorithm and a multi-criteria decision method is presented for integrated energy optimization. This proposed framework is then tested for the audited cement plant at two major steps. First, an efficient metaheuristic optimization approach is employed to optimize the compounds of clinker to reduce the consumption of energy in the cement industry. Second, a decision-making procedure, namely analytic hierarchy process, is used to make right decisions to reduce energy losses after completing an energy audit program. Results of the present study indicate the effectiveness of the proposed framework based on metaheuristic algorithm and decision-making approach. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cement industry; Decision-making procedure; Energy audit; Optimization; Quality of cement","Cement plants; Cements; Decision making; Energy conservation; Energy dissipation; Global optimization; Optimization; Decision making procedure; Energy audit; Energy balance analysis; Industrial case study; Materials and products; Meta heuristic algorithm; Meta-heuristic optimizations; Multi-criteria decision methods; Cement industry; algorithm; cement (construction material); decision making; energy balance; energy use; optimization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069703491

Recently, several above ground biomass (AGB) maps have been produced using a variety of approaches to assess the carbon stock of the subtropical forest in China. However, due to the lack of reliable ground observations and the limitations of AGB mapping methods at regional scales, estimates of the spatial distribution of AGB vary greatly, leading to large uncertainties in the carbon stock estimations. In this study, we produced a new 1-km spatial resolution AGB map by synthesizing an unprecedented number of ground AGB observations from published studies, and developed an AGB mapping method using a combination of ground observations, MODIS data, forest cover/gain/loss maps based on Landsat, GLAS forest canopy height, and climatic and terrain data. In addition, we validated our estimates using independent testing data and compared our estimates with three previous AGB maps. The results indicate that the total AGB stock in the subtropical forest of China is (266 ± 9.1) × 106 Mg, with an average AGB of 123.2 Mg/ha. Based on sixteen explanatory variables, our ensemble mean model explains 75% of the variance in forest AGB, with an RMSE of 45.5 Mg/ha. Comparison using all observation data shows that our map has a significantly lower RMSE and bias than previous maps, where the RMSE and bias tended to vary with forest type. This study not only improved the accuracy of AGB estimation for the subtropical forests but also highlighted the importance of forest type for regional AGB estimation. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Aboveground biomass; Carbon stock; Ground data; Remote sensing; Subtropical forest","Biomass; Carbon; Forestry; Remote sensing; Tropics; Uncertainty analysis; Above ground biomass; Carbon stocks; Explanatory variables; Global carbon cycle; Ground data; Ground observations; Spatial resolution; Subtropical forests; Mapping; aboveground biomass; accuracy assessment; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; comparative study; estimation method; GLAS; ground-based measurement; Landsat; mapping method; MODIS; remote sensing; satellite data; spatial resolution; subtropical region; terrain; tropical forest; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069819838

For this purpose, we use a global non-radial distance function to examine the efficiency and abatement cost of carbon emissions and take China's Poyang Lake Ecological Economics Zone (PLEEZ), one of China's national strategy for sustainable development, as an empirical study. By using the non-radial efficiency model, the carbon emissions efficiency indicator can be constructed. By employing the dual model of the non-radial directional distance function, the shadow prices of carbon emissions, which is interpreted as marginal abatement cost can be derived. County level data from 2009 to 2013 of the PLEEZ is used as the empirical investigation. Empirical results show that the CO2 emissions of the PLEEZ are not performing efficiently and the CO2 emissions efficiency remains at a very low level with an average value of 0.279. Meanwhile, the shadow prices of CO2 emissions are calculated, with a mean value of 11.867 yuan per ton, which is relatively low compared with other previous studies of different regions or industry and indicate that carbon emissions are not strictly regulated. Moreover, significant heterogeneities in the carbon efficiency and abatement cost are found among three major functional zones in the PLEEZ remain. Major agriculture production zone shows better carbon efficiency than key ecological function zone, but lower than key economic development zone. It is also found carbon abatement cost of major agriculture production zone is lower than key economic development zone indicating the less pressure under climate change mitigation. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions efficiency; Major agriculture production zone; Marginal abatement cost; Poyang lake eco-economic zone","Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Ecology; Economic and social effects; Economics; Efficiency; Lakes; Planning; Agriculture productions; Carbon emissions; Climate change mitigation; Directional distance function; Ecological function zones; Empirical investigation; Marginal abatement costs; Poyang lake eco-economic zones; Climate change; abatement cost; agricultural production; carbon emission; climate change; economic development; environmental economics; national strategy; sustainable development; China; Jiangxi; Poyang Lake",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85037567658

The in-depth analysis of geothermal resources in China, including their distribution and breakdown by shallow, hydrothermal, and hot dry rock (HDR) resources, is made in this study. Using the recent economic reports and state-of-the-art technological solutions, this survey outlines the latest trends in the geothermal power generation in China. The application of geothermal power generation in China is still at an early stage, with the total installed capacity of 27.78 MW. The geothermal power generation technologies, such as dry steam technology, flash technology, binary cycle technology, and enhanced geothermal system (EGS), are briefly discussed and linked to their lucrative implementation sites. In particular, Tibet's Yangbajing is considered to be the most lucrative site for the EGS pilot project. The comparative analysis of low-cost/large-scale geothermal power generation technologies, such as low- to medium-temperature one, solar-geothermal hybrid one, and geothermal power generation in mines, was made, whose results strongly indicated the EGS technical and economical advantages. The concentration of 96% of China's population in the area to the east of Hu line affects the perspectives of high-cost geothermal projects and has to be accounted in the comprehensive analysis of available data. Based on the revealed trends of geothermal resources’ development in China, the following guidelines are strongly recommended: comprehensive incorporation of geothermal energy generation into China's national energy and climate improvement plans, the rapid implementation of HDR technology, as well as comprehensive adaptation of the geothermal-related projects to the local conditions/biased distribution of power consumers and state-of-the-art challenges of power consumption. © 2019 The Authors.

The bacterial diversity of many urban parks around the world has been reported; however, the role of fungi is often ignored. There are only one or two published reports of fungal community composition analysis from urban parks. In the present study, we investigated soil fungal diversity in 24 urban parks in Shanghai using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. At the taxonomic level, 540,657 effective fungal sequences were acquired from the soil from 24 urban parks. Other than some unclassified phyla, the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) collected from all 24 urban park soils were distributed into five fungal phyla; of these, Ascomycota was the most dominant phylum, followed by Zygomycota and Basidiomycota. Many fungi identified in the present study are known to play key roles in the environment, with particularly important roles in maintaining sustainability in the soil ecosystem. The identified mycorrhizal fungi may play a major role in the biogeochemical cycle, as these fungi obtain carbon from their host plants and allocate it to the soil ecosystem; they also participate in mineralisation of various inorganic substances, helping with the growth of plants. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Biogeochemical cycle; Fungi; Soil; Urban parks; Urbanisation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072229147

The BA removal ratios reached to 81.7%, 70.1%, and 55.2% in the three UV-A/AHA/Fe(II)/PMS processes within 600 s. The removal ratios were higher than those in UV-A/EDTA/Fe(II)/PMS and UV-A/oxalic/Fe(II)/PMS (16.2% and 14.4%, respectively). The enhancement effect of oxidation was attributed to the continuous activation of PMS by the regeneration of Fe(II)from the photolysis of Fe(III)-AHA complexes. The degradation of BA was classified into two stages based on the degradation kinetics. In the first stage, 15.2%, 18.4% and 11.0% of BA was removed by HO[rad] and SO4[rad]− generated from the reaction of PMS with the addition of Fe(II)in UV-A/citric/Fe(II)/PMS, UV-A/tartaric/Fe(II)/PMS, and UV-A/malic/Fe(II)/PMS, respectively. In the second stage, most of BA (44.2%-66.5%)was oxidized by HO[rad] and SO4[rad]− produced from the reaction between PMS and the regeneration of Fe(II)from the photolysis of Fe(III)-AHA complexes. Both steady-state concentrations and oxidation contributions of HO[rad] and SO4[rad]− in the second stage were determined according to the degradation dynamics of BA and nitrobenzene. The degradation of BA in the three UV-A/AHA/Fe(II)/PMS processes was pH dependent at near-neutral pH (pHini = 5.0–7.0). In the presence of anions, the BA removal ratios decreased with the order of bicarbonate &gt; chloride &gt; sulfate. In the presence of humic acid (HA), the oxidation capabilities of UV-A/AHA/Fe(II)/PMS decreased due to the inner filter effect on the photolysis of Fe(III)-AHA complexes. The acute toxicity assay indicated that the UV-A/AHA/Fe(II)/PMS processes efficiently eliminated the toxicity of BA degradation products. With the fast radicals generation at near-neutral pH and high oxidation capabilities at different environmental factors, the three UV-A/AHA/Fe(II)/PMS processes exhibit potential to be a strong peroxymonosulfate activation method. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Alpha hydroxy acids; Benzoic acid degradation; Fenton-like system; Peroxymonosulfate; UV-A irradiation","Benzoic acid; Chemical activation; Chlorine compounds; Degradation; Irradiation; Oxidation; Photolysis; Sulfur compounds; Toxicity; Acid degradation; Alpha hydroxy acids; Degradation kinetics; Environmental factors; Fenton likes; Peroxymonosulfate; Peroxymonosulfate activations; Steady state concentration; Iron compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065261264

Accurate estimations of changes in aboveground biomass are critical for understanding forest carbon cycling and promoting climate change mitigation. Southwest China is characterized by complex topographic features and forest canopy structures, complicating methods for mapping aboveground biomass and its dynamics. The integration of continuous Landsat images and national forest inventory data provides an alternative approach to develop a long-term monitoring program of forest aboveground biomass dynamics. This study explores the development of a methodological framework using historical national forest inventory plot data and Landsat TM time-series images. This method was formulated by comparing two parametric methods: Linear Regression for Multiple Independent Variables (MLR), and Partial Least Square Regression (PLSR); and two nonparametric methods: Random Forest (RF) and Gradient Boost Regression Tree (GBRT) based on the state of forest aboveground biomass and change models. The methodological framework mapped Pinus densata aboveground biomass and its changes over time in Shangri-la, Yunnan, China. Landsat images and national forest inventory data were acquired for 1987, 1992, 1997, 2002 and 2007. The results show that: (1) correlation and homogeneity texture measures were able to characterize forest canopy structures, aboveground biomass and its dynamics; (2) GBRT and RF predicted Pinus densata aboveground biomass and its changes better than PLSR and MLR; (3) GBRT was the most reliable approach in the estimation of aboveground biomass and its changes; and, (4) the aboveground biomass change models showed a promising improvement of prediction accuracy. This study indicates that the combination of GBRT state and change models developed using temporal Landsat and national forest inventory data provides the potential for developing a methodological framework for the long-term mapping and monitoring program of forest aboveground biomass and its changes in Southwest China. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Forest biomass change; Gradient Boost Regression Tree; Landsat multi-temporal images; Permanent sample plots; Pinus densata; Shangri-La, China","aboveground biomass; canopy architecture; carbon sequestration; climate change; coniferous forest; coniferous tree; estimation method; forest inventory; Landsat; mitigation; regression analysis; sampling; satellite imagery; time series analysis; China; Yunnan; Pinus densata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048692758

This paper tries to analyze this issue from the perspective of industrial sub-sectors at the provincial level. We first calculate the carbon emissions of 37 individual industrial sub-sectors in each of China's 26 provinces from 2005 to 2015, covering both direct and indirect emissions. Cautiously identifying the industrial sub-sectors covered by China's pilot ETSs, we explore the causal impact of China's pilot ETSs on reducing carbon emissions at the initial stage (2013–2015) and analyze the paths of achieved emission reductions, applying a difference-in-difference (DID) model and a combination of DID estimator and propensity score matching technique. Our results yield robust evidence that China's pilot ETSs have significantly promoted carbon emission reductions of the covered industrial sub-sectors, and this impact has presented an overall enhanced trend according to year-by-year analysis. The results also show that the pilot ETSs have failed to enable covered industrial sub-sectors to effectively cut carbon intensity and the impact on carbon intensity is not obvious in any of the first three years, and the carbon emission reductions have mainly been achieved through the decreased outputs of industrial sub-sectors. China's policy makers should tighten the free allowance allocation approaches in order to facilitate low-carbon technology innovations and reduce carbon intensity of industrial sectors. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission reduction; Causal impact; China; Emissions trading scheme","Carbon; Commerce; Decision making; Allocation approach; Carbon emission reductions; Causal impact; China; Difference-in-differences; Emissions Trading Scheme; Low-carbon technologies; Propensity score matching; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068080361

This study focuses on projections of future moisture flux changes over the Tibetan Plateau (TP). First, the downscaling results for the historical period (1980–2005) are evaluated for precipitation P, evaporation E, and precipitation minus evaporation P 2 E against Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) data. The mechanism of P 2 E changes is analyzed by decomposition into dynamic, thermodynamic, and transient eddy components. Whether the historical period changes and mechanisms continue into the future (2010–2100) is investigated using the WRF and CCSM model projections under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios. Compared with coarse-resolution forcing, downscaling was found to better reproduce the historical spatial patterns and seasonal mean of annual average P, E, and P 2 E over the TP. WRF projects a diverse spatial variation of P 2 E changes, with an increase in the northern TP and a decrease in the southern TP, compared with the uniform increase in CCSM. The dynamic component dominates P 2 E changes for the historical period in both the CCSM and WRF projections. In the future, however, the thermodynamic component in CCSM dominates P 2 E changes under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 from the near-term (2010–39) to the long-term (2070–99) future. Unlike the CCSM projections, the WRF projections reproduce the mechanism seen in the historical period—that is, the dynamic component dominates P 2 E changes. Furthermore, future P 2 E changes in the dynamical downscaling are less sensitive to warming than its coarse-resolution forcing. © 2019 American Meteorological Society.",,"Dynamics; Evaporation; Moisture; Dynamical downscaling; Global climate model; High-resolution datasets; Historical periods; Land data assimilation systems; Regional climate modeling; Regional climate models; Spatial variations; Climate models; climate modeling; data assimilation; decomposition analysis; downscaling; future prospect; global climate; moisture flux; regional climate; thermodynamics; weather forecasting; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074630217

Understanding their impacts on household emissions is crucial for designing mitigation policies for household carbon emissions. By integrating Chinese older household survey data with an unconditional quantile regression model, this paper examines the heterogeneous impacts of household characteristics on indirect carbon emissions of older Chinese households. There are three main findings: (1) The effects of urbanization on emissions at different quantiles of carbon emissions appear to be inverted U-shaped, which means that the rise of urbanization level increases carbon emissions more at the middle than at the bottom or the top, and helps to alleviate carbon emission inequality, (2) though carbon emissions rise with the increase of income, there is a clear urban-rural divide in the effects of income on carbon emissions, and (3) the rise in the share of well-educated people contributes to the increase in carbon emissions. The higher the degree of education is, the larger the impact is. These findings contribute to understanding the determinants of carbon emissions and are helpful for policymakers to design targeted policies in reducing carbon emissions from the consumption-side. © 2019 by the authors.","Indirect carbon emissions; Low carbon policy; Older households; Unconditional quantile regression","aging; carbon emission; education; emission control; fuel consumption; heterogeneity; household survey; mitigation; policy making; regression analysis; rural-urban comparison; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073933282

Micro-structural changes were identified pre- and post-experiment using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD) analysis for powdered coal (mineralogical changes), optical microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) for polished thin sections (surface feature changes) and micro-CT scanning for a small core (porosity and permeability changes). XRD analysis revealed that carbonic acid leaches out mineral matters in coal, including carbonates (calcite) and silicate minerals (albite, illite and kaolinite). Optical microscopy, SEM and CT images confirmed that the interaction of coal with ScCO2–water causes an abundance of micro-cracks to open or propagate in unconfined coal samples. Most micro-cracks preferably propagated along maceral–mineral and maceral–maceral interfaces, which demonstrates that the micro-cracking was caused by differential swelling of different coal lithotypes. Wormhole formation was observed in coal caused by mineral dissolution and hydrocarbon mobilization, which significantly increases coal porosity compared with swelling-induced cracking. 3-D pore network models extracted from CT images show that ScCO2–water treatment enlarges the pore and throat size, increases the numbers of pores and throats and improves pore network connectivity. Overall, CO2–water–coal interactions under unconfined conditions enhance coal porosity, connectivity and permeability, which can be attributed to the combined effect of micro-cracking, mineral dissolution and hydrocarbon mobilization. © 2019, International Association for Mathematical Geosciences.","Connectivity; Micro-CT; Pore network model; Supercritical CO2",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060979784

Our framework was applied to Chinese provincial data from 2000 to 2016. We identified nine factors to explain changes of regional CO2 emissions. Results demonstrate that economic scale, energy technology efficiency, and output technology efficiency increased CO2 emissions in Eastern, Central, and Western regions of China, with the economic scale being the largest contributor. Energy structure, energy intensity, energy technology progress, and output technology progress decreased regional CO2 emissions, with the energy technology progress playing the strongest role. Energy technology gap and output technology gap led to an increase in CO2 emissions in Central China and, to a lesser extent, in Western China.

In this study, the characteristics of ambient AHs were investigated at an urban site (Ziyang, ZY) and a suburban site (Jiangxia, JX) in Wuhan, Central China, in 2017. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) model was used to investigate the sources of AHs, and a health risk assessment was applied to estimate the effects of AHs on human health. The concentrations of total AHs at ZY (2048 ± 1364 pptv) were comparable (p &gt; 0.05) to that (2023 ± 1015 pptv) at JX. Source apportionment results revealed that vehicle exhaust was the dominant source of both, total AHs, and toluene, contributing 51.9 ± 13.1% and 49.3 ± 9.5% at ZY, and 44.7 ± 12.6% and 43.2 ± 10.2% at JX, respectively. Benzene was mainly emitted from vehicle exhaust at ZY (50.2 ± 15.5%), while it was mainly released from biomass and coal burning sources at JX (50.6 ± 16.7%). The health risk assessment results indicated that AHs did not have a significant non-carcinogenic risk, while the carcinogenic risks of benzene exceeded the regulatory limits set by the USEPA for adults (1 × 10-6) at both sites. Hence, controlling the emissions of vehicular and biomass/coal burning sources will be an effective way to reduce ambient AHs and the health risk of benzene exposure in this region. These findings will enhance our knowledge of ambient AHs in Central China and be helpful for local governments to formulate air pollution control strategies. © 2019 by the authors.","Aromatic hydrocarbons; Central China; Emission sources; Health risk assessment; Spatiotemporal pattern","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Aromatization; Benzene; Factorization; Health; Health risks; Mineral oils; Risk perception; Urban growth; Benzene exposures; Carcinogenic risk; Central chinas; Emission sources; Hazardous air pollutants; Positive matrix factorization models; Source apportionment; Spatiotemporal patterns; Risk assessment; aromatic hydrocarbon; atmospheric pollution; emission; health risk; risk assessment; spatial variation; suburban area; temporal variation; urban atmosphere; China; Hubei; Wuhan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074073951

Gaining fundamental knowledge on the origin and behavior of flow phenomena such as global cells and planetary waves is interesting not only from a meteorological perspective. Understanding the interaction between atmospheric circulation and a planet’s climate, be it Earth, Mars, Jupiter, or a distant exoplanet, contributes to various fields of research such as astrophysics, geophysics, fluid physics, and climatology. AtmoFlow aims to observe flows in a thin spherical gap that are subjected to a central force-field. The Earth’s own gravitational field interferes with a simulated central force-field with the given parameters of the model which makes microgravity conditions of g &lt; 1 0 − 3g (e.g. on the ISS) necessary. Without losing its overall view on the complex physics, circulation in planetary atmospheres can be reduced to a simple model of a central gravitational field, the incoming and outgoing energy (e.g. radiation) and rotational effects. This strongly simplified assumption makes it possible to break some generic cases down to test models which can be investigated by laboratory experiments and numerical simulations. Varying rotational rates and temperature boundary conditions represent different types of planets. This is a very basic approach, but various open questions regarding local pattern formation or global planetary cells can be investigated with that setup. A concept has been defined for developing a payload that could be installed and utilized on-board the International Space Station (ISS). This concept is based on the microgravity experiment GeoFlow, which has been conducted successfully between 2008 and 2016 on the ISS. This paper addresses the scientific goals, the experimental setup, the concept for implementation of the AtmoFlow experiment on the ISS and first numerical results. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Atmospheric flows; Dielectric heating; Dielectrophoresis; Microgravity conditions; Rotating convection","Astrophysics; Climatology; Dielectric heating; Earth (planet); Electrophoresis; Gravitational effects; Microgravity; Microgravity processing; Planets; Radiation effects; Space stations; Atmospheric circulation; Atmospheric flows; Gravitational fields; International Space stations; Laboratory experiments; Microgravity conditions; Microgravity experiments; Rotating convection; Flow of fluids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068238826

Common spruce was the most resistant to environmental factors: its photosynthetic activity was 1.4 times higher than that of Douglas fir. Calculations revealed that the level of CO2 assimilation was 3.6 and 2.7 times higher than the light respiration level for common spruce and Douglas fir, respectively, which indicates a positive carbon dioxide exchange and an important role of coniferous trees in regulating the carbon balance of an urban ecosystem. © 2019, Allerton Press, Inc.","air temperature; carbon dioxide exchange; coniferous trees; illumination; photosynthesis; respiration; urban environment",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086227573

This study analyzes the effects of policy changes on coal transportation routes on transportation (traffic congestion) and environmental economics (air pollution, noise, loss value). The research method involved literature reviews and field surveys. The results indicated that after the 2017 policy, there was a decrease in the volume of coal transportation passing public roads by 92.4%, a decrease in speed and traffic congestion of 13% and 0.2 points. The noise level decreased to 4.87 dB (A). CO2 emissions reduced by 44.30%, CO by 48.82%, HC by 46.22%, Nox by 22.03%, SOx by 22.01% and PM10 by 25.66%., the value of losses due to the burden of vehicle emissions decreased by 24.3%. Visually, pedestrians and road users become more comfortable and safe in traffic.

Current field observations across the Neotropics suggest that liana abundance is rising as a result of forest disturbance, increasing atmospheric CO2, and more frequent extreme climate events. Lianas can cause mechanical stress on their host trees, thus increasing mortality, in addition to potentially reducing carbon storage capacity. Furthermore, previous studies have suggested that liana leaves have an overall higher temperature than tree leaves, which presents the question of whether these differences can be extended from the leaf to the canopy. In this context, the ability to detect these temperature differences from a remote sensing platform has so far not been put into test, despite the importance such knowledge can have in large-scale land surface modeling studies and liana extent monitoring. To partially fill this knowledge gap, we acquired thermal infrared data using an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) system over an intermediate tropical dry forest in Costa Rica, Central America. Classification results from a previous study in the same area were used to subset the thermal infrared images into liana-infested areas, non-liana infested areas, and forest gaps. The temperature differences between these three image components were then investigated using the Welch and Games-Howell post-hoc statistical tests. Our results suggest that liana-infested areas have, on average, a statistically significant higher temperature than non-liana infested areas. Shadowed forest gaps, used as reference, have a cooler temperature than forest canopies. Our findings onthe temperature differences between liana-infested and non-liana infested areas support previous leaf-level observations and open the door to the use of new approaches for the classification and modeling of liana infestation in tropical ecosystems. © 2019 by the authors.

Many studies have checked the relationship between short-term exposure to particulate matter (PM) and stroke, but few have focused on the effect of long-term exposure to PM2.5 (particulate matters with an aerodynamic diameter of ≤2.5 μm). This study aimed to quantitatively examine the relationship of long-term exposure to PM2.5 with stroke incidence and mortality. Methods: We identified relevant studies by searching the PubMed, EMBASE and MEDLINE. After the systematical review of pertinent studies, random-effect meta-analysis was conducted to investigate the association between long-term exposure to PM2.5 and stroke. Results: Our meta-analysis included 16 cohort studies with more than 2.2 million people and above 49 149 endpoint events (incident stroke and death from stroke). The pooled hazard ratio (HR) for each 5 μg/m3 increment in PM2.5 was 1.11 (95% CI: 1.05, 1.17) (CI for confidence interval) for incidence of stroke and 1.11 (95% CI:1.05, 1.17) for mortality of stroke. In the region-specific analysis, significant association between PM2.5 and incidence of stroke was found in North America (HR=1.09, 95% CI:1.05, 1.14) and Europe (HR=1.07, 95% CI:1.05, 1.10), while the pooled result of Asia showed no significance (HR=2.31, 95% CI:0.49, 10.95). Conclusions: Long-term exposure to PM2.5 is an important risk factor for stroke.

On-chip, tailorable capacitive sensors integrated with metal–organic framework (MOF) films are presented, in which abundant coordinatively unsaturated metal sites are available for gas detection. The in situ growth of homogeneous Mg-MOF-74 films is realized with an appropriate metal-to-ligand ratio. The resultant sensors exhibit selective detection for benzene vapor and carbon dioxide (CO2) at room temperature. Postsynthetic modification of Mg-MOF-74 films with ethylenediamine decreases sensitivity toward benzene but increases selectivity to CO2. The reduced porosity and blocked open metal sites caused by amine coordination account for a deterioration in the sensing performance for benzene (by ca. 60 %). The enhanced sensitivity for CO2 (by ca. 25 %) stems from a tailored amine–CO2 interaction. This study demonstrates the feasibility of tuning gas sensing properties by adjusting MOF–analyte interactions, thereby offering new perspectives for the development of MOF-based sensors. © 2019 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

They are believed to have revolutionized the conventional CO2 chemisorption process by largely improving CO2 capture kinetics and reducing the energy requirement for solvent regeneration. Two classes of nanomaterial-based CO2 capture absorbents, amine-based nanoparticle suspensions (nanofluids) and nanoparticle organic hybrid materials (NOHMs), have been developed, with significant progress achieved in recent decades. This review addresses two key questions for these two state-of-the-art nanomaterials: how are the physical and chemical properties of the prepared liquid nano-absorbents transformed relative to those of the base fluids? And how does the transformation of the properties affect the CO2 capture behavior? While the current synthesis procedure for liquid nano-absorbents is quite straightforward, more advanced synthesis methods for long-term nanoparticle stability have been suggested for the future. Nanofluids have been shown to increase the CO2 uptake by over 20% and the CO2 capture rate by 2-93% compared with the values observed with neat amine solvents. Nanoparticles with catalytic effects on CO2 capture can significantly increase the CO2 desorption rate by as high as 4000%. NOHMs exhibit the interesting feature of enhanced mass transfer in CO2 capture because of the unique pathway network that is created in them for CO2 to reach specific functional groups. NOHMs promise an effect of combined CO2 capture and conversion, and can be used especially as electrolytes for CO2 electro-reduction.

Oil-source correlation is of great importance in the study of the petroleum system, for it contributes to the selection of favorable exploration sites. Previously, much attention has been paid to the study of the third member of the Shahejie Formation (E2s3 Fm.). The contribution of the fourth member of the Shahejie Formation (E2s4 Fm.) to the petroleum accumulation often failed to get adequate attention, which resulted in some difficulties in exploiting this area. In view of this, in our research, in the light of the theory of molecular organic geochemistry, the geochemical characteristics of 19 crude oil and 8 source rock samples (cuttings) from the study area are analyzed by means of gas chromatography (GC) and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). On the basis of the analysis of oil composition and 16 biomarker parameters of saturated fractions, the following findings are generated: (a) the crude oil of Laizhou Bay Sag can be classified into three oil families: oil family A, oil family B, and oil family C. (b) the E2s4 source rocks were deposited in a low-alkalinity, hypersaline lacustrine environment under heavily reducing condition in which carbonates or evaporites were being precipitated and the organic matter is planktonic-organism-sourced (e.g., dinoflagellate-sourced); (c) oil family A, with medium maturity, is generated from the E2s3 FM. Oil family B, with low maturity, is generated from the E2s4 FM. Oil family C is the mixtures of oil family A and B oil. (d) A set of specific system has been established for the effective evaluation of the source and properties of the oil from the study area. © 2019, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","E2s4 Fm. source rocks; Hypersaline lacustrine environment; Laizhou Bay Sag; Oil-source correlation; Planktonic-organism-sourced organic matter","alkalinity; biomarker; crude oil; gas chromatography; geochemistry; hydrocarbon exploration; lacustrine environment; mass spectrometry; organic matter; petroleum hydrocarbon; source rock; Bohai Sea; Bohaiwan Basin; China; Laizhou Bay; Shandong; Dinophyceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073559429

Therefore, nitrogen-doped porous carbons (NPCs) were prepared through a facile carbonization/activation strategy by treating different mass ratios of melamine-urea-formaldehyde resin and KOH. It is clearly demonstrated that because of the introduction of KOH, the resulting NPCs were shown to have increased specific surface area and a rich pore structure, and the best sample possessed a large specific surface area of 2248 m2 g-1 and high N content, which contributed to the good electrochemical performance for supercapacitors. Accordingly, a three-electrode system assembles NPCs as an electrode using aqueous KOH solution; the specific capacitance was 341 F g-1 under the current density of 1 A g-1 and retained a specific capacitance of almost 92% after 5000 cycles. The maximum energy output for a symmetrical solid-state supercapacitor with NPCs as the electrode material was 9.60 W h kg-1 at 1 A g-1.

The significance of aerosols in regional and global climate change assessment has become a pressing topic in recent climate discussions. Two different approaches are used in measuring AOT; satellite imagery and ground measurement approaches. However, the satellite approach is deemed the best way for monitoring the patterns and transport of aerosols largely due to its extensive spatial coverage and reliable repetitive measurements. The data in this study were obtained from a Sea-viewing Wide Field-of-view Sensor (SeaWiFS), a Multi-angle Imaging Spectroradiometer (MISR), and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors based on a NASA-operated Giovanni portal. Ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) datasets from two sites over the study area were also used. The results show that the highest AOT ground values of 1.93 and 2.00 were recorded in September 2015, at USM station and Kuching station, respectively. Throughout the 15 years of recorded data, the monthly average value of AOT reached its highest values in September, October, and November. In these months, the value of AOT went above 0.40, unlike in other months of the year. Significantly, the results indicate that Malaysian air quality can be evaluated based on AOT values, as these show the variation in optical properties of aerosol. © 2019, Universiti Putra Malaysia Press.

While scientists have suggested that results could be relevant for climate adaptation policy, this has had little empirical investigation, particularly in developing regions. Taking the case of Senegal, the national adaptation policy context regarding extreme precipitation and flooding in urban areas, and the scientific information needed to support this policy is investigated using key informant interviews, a workshop and document analysis. Flooding in Senegal was found to be viewed primarily as an urban planning concern rather than a climate change issue, with actions to address the impacts focussing on current vulnerabilities of urban communities without considering changing climate risks. While stakeholders thought event attribution might be useful to inform about climate change impacts and future risks of extreme events, it is unclear whether there would be an opportunity for this at present, due to the limited role climate information has in adaptation decision-making. While addressing vulnerability to extremes is necessary whether or not the risk is climate change-related, if long-term planning is to be resilient then knowledge about future changes in risks of extremes will need to be considered, even if individual events are not attributed to climate change. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

The study of BNF in non-leguminous plants has been difficult compared to nodule-localized BNF in leguminous plants because of the diverse sites of N2 fixation in non-leguminous plants. Identification of the involved N2-fixing bacteria has also been difficult because the major nitrogen fixers were often lost during isolation attempts. The past 20 years of molecular analyses has led to the identification of N2 fixation sites and active nitrogen fixers in tissues and the rhizosphere of non-leguminous plants. Here, we examined BNF hotspots in six reported non-leguminous plants. Novel rhizobia and methanotrophs were found to be abundantly present in the free-living state at sites where carbon and energy sources were predominantly available. In the carbon-rich apoplasts of plant tissues, rhizobia such as Bradyrhizobium spp. microaerobically fix N2. In paddy rice fields, methane molecules generated under anoxia are oxidized by xylem aerenchyma-transported oxygen with the simultaneous fixation of N2 by methane-oxidizing methanotrophs. We discuss the effective functions of the rhizobia and methanotrophs in non-legumes for the acquisition of fixed nitrogen in addition to research perspectives. © 2019 by the authors.

However, studies pertaining to the haze in Changzhou are very limited, which makes it difficult to understand the characteristics and formation of winter haze in this area, and develop effective control measures. In this study, we carried out continuous online observation of particulate matter, chemical components, and meteorology in Changzhou in February 2017. Our results showed that haze pollution occurred frequently in Changzhou winter and exhibited two patterns: dry haze with low relative humidity (RH) and wet haze with high RH. Water-soluble inorganic ions (SO42−, NO3−, and NH4+) accounted for ∼52.2% of the PM2.5 mass, of which sulfate was dominant in wet haze periods while nitrate was dominant in other periods. With the deterioration of haze pollution, the proportion of nitrate in PM2.5 increased, while sulfate proportion increased under wet haze and decreased under dry haze. Dry haze and wet haze appeared under slow north wind and south wind, respectively, and strong north wind or sea breeze scavenged pollution. We found that formation of nitrate occurred rapidly in daytime with high concentrations of odd oxygen (Ox = O3 + NO2), whereas formation of sulfate occurred rapidly during nighttime with high RH, indicating that photochemistry and heterogeneous reaction were the major formation mechanisms for nitrate and sulfate, respectively. Through the cluster analysis of 36-h backward trajectories, five sources of air masses from three directions were identified.

The main focus is the investigation of effects of seven design variables, including swirl ratio, the first and second start of injections (SOI1 and SOI2), and four injection rate-shape parameters, on the objective parameters, namely, gross indicated efficiency, the second-law efficiency, ringing intensity, and emissions. The results show that in the low swirl ratio range (swirl ratio < 1), the emissions decrease by either increasing boot length or decreasing boot velocity. The physical analysis reveals that this is due to the penetration of the high-reactivity fuel vapor in whole squish area and a large portion of the crevice. This is because the more uniform mixture in the squish region slightly mitigates the formation of hot spots and NOx, and the propagation of reaction deeper into the crevice considerably reduces carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons there. The sensitivity analysis manifests that swirl ratio has the strongest effect on all objectives, and besides swirl ratio, SOI2 has the greatest impact on gross indicated efficiency and emission, while SOI1 has the strongest influence on second-law efficiency and ringing intensity. The optimal case with an advance of SOI1 and a slight retard of SOI2, that is, a longer duration between the two injections, a lower swirl ratio (of 0.5) with respect to the base case, and appropriate injection rate-shape parameters (a high boot length and low boot velocity), achieves the gross indicated efficiency of 54% and merit function of 615. © IMechE 2018.","boot injection rate-shape; emission; multi-objective optimization; OpenFOAM; Reactivity controlled compression ignition","Air engines; Carbon monoxide; Efficiency; Microemulsions; Multiobjective optimization; Neutron emission; Parameter estimation; Sensitivity analysis; Compression ignition; Compression ignition engine; Indicated efficiency; Injection rates; Objective parameters; OpenFOAM; Second law efficiencies; Unburned hydrocarbons; Diesel engines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053420339

This paper builds a RER (renewable energy consumption rate) index to represent the energy structure of a country and proposes a U-shaped RKC (renewable energy Kuznets Curve) hypothesis between RER and economic growth. We also examine the dynamic relationship between RER and the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) hypothesis using two panel data sets of 17 major developing and developed countries as well as six geo-economic regions of the world during 1990–2014. Panel co-integration tests indicate that a long-run relationship exists among economic growth, RER and carbon emission. We employ the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) and the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) techniques to estimate the co-integration coefficients of the panels and individual countries/regions respectively. The results verify both the EKC and RKC hypotheses, indicating that a 10% rise in RER would to a 1.6% carbon emission reduction. It is also found that the RKC turning points of individual countries and the entire samples in general take place before the turning points of the respective EKCs. It suggests that promoting renewable energy consumption to make RKC cross its turning point earlier can accelerate EKC to reach its turning point more quickly. This finding has important policy implications with respect to the development and utilization of renewable energy and environmental protection. © 2019","Carbon emission; Economic growth; Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC); Renewable energy; Renewable energy Kuznets Curve (RKC)","Carbon; Emission control; Energy utilization; Public policy; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon emissions; Development and utilizations; Economic growths; Environmental Kuznets curves; Ordinary least squares; Renewable energies; Renewable energy consumption; Economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068711732

Various hazardous compounds containing in wastes might be enriched in the particulate matter (PM) emitted during the waste disposal and cause adverse environmental consequences. In order to evaluate the potential environmental issues caused by the PM emission from the cement kiln for co-processing wastes, the chemical characteristics and formation mechanism of the PM was investigated for the first time by using a laboratory-scale tube furnace to simulate this process. PM was collected to analyze the major components (heavy metals, inorganic and organic components) and morphologies. The results reveal that volatile heavy metals in municipal sewage sludge (MSS) can be enriched in PM. The process can elevate the levels of sulfate and the organic contents in PM, and the existence of organic moieties such as CN+ and CHN+ suggest that the co-processing of MSS can affect the PM organic compositions. Single particle imaging analyses indicate that PM can be classified into nine types based on their elemental compositions. Further analysis reveals that most particles usually mix with other types of particles and those mixed particles may cause a more serious impact on the environment. Based on the TEM observation, a two-step formation mechanism of PM is proposed. Our findings point out the potential environmental adverse effects and call attentions to a full environment assessment of this new type of cement production process, and also indicates stringent measures should be taken to reduce PM emissions during this process. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cement kiln; Heavy metals; Municipal sewage sludge; Waste","Cements; Heavy metals; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Satellites; Sewage sludge; Sulfur compounds; Waste disposal; Waste utilization; Wastes; Cement kiln; Chemical characteristic; Elemental compositions; Environment assessments; Environmental consequences; Impact on the environment; Integrated utilization; Municipal sewage sludge; Kilns",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068045107

However, little research focusing on carbon dioxide reduction and resource utilization has been done in the field of disassembly line balancing. For the purpose of being environmentally friendly, the disassembly line balancing should aim at low carbon emission, low energy consumption and cost reduction during the disassembly process. Considering this, this study proposes a multi-objective disassembly line balancing fruit fly optimization algorithm (MDFOA) for the disassembly sequence of obsolete agricultural machinery considering low-carbon design. We try to optimize the disassembly line balancing model using the fruit fly optimization algorithm. To satisfy the stability of MDFOA, the olfactory operation is cross-operated, and the Pareto non-dominated sorting method is adopted in the visual operation stage. In order to avoid falling into local optimum, a global cooperation mechanism is added to screen individuals with different degrees of dissimilarity. An illustrative example of the disassembly line of corn harvester cutting table is provided in this work. Comparison between our proposed MDFOA and other four frequently-used algorithms is conducted in this work. The results show that our method performs better than other algorithms for the disassembly line balancing problem (DLBP), thus verifying the practicability and feasibility of it. In the end, 12 Pareto solutions are obtained through MDFOA and we evaluated and selected the most satisfactory solution among them using Fuzzy AHP, for the determination of the optimal disassembly sequence. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Disassembly; Low-carbon; MDFOA; Remanufacturing","Agricultural machinery; Carbon dioxide; Cost reduction; Energy utilization; Fruits; Hierarchical systems; Machine design; Optimization; Pollution control; Carbon dioxide reduction; Disassembly; Disassembly line balancing; Low carbon; Low energy consumption; MDFOA; Remanufacturing; Satisfactory solutions; Balancing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067576643

In this study, using a three-dimensional numerical model [nested air quality prediction modeling system (NAQPMS)] coupled with an on-line source apportionment module, the contribution of different source regions and source categories to the O3 concentration in the PRD region was quantified. A comparison with observation data confirmed that the NAQPMS adequately reproduced surface O3 concentrations in different seasons. Compared with biogenic emissions, anthropogenic precursors play a dominant role in O3 production. In Guangzhou city, among different source categories, mobile emission is the largest contributor (accounting for approximately 40%), followed by industry emissions (20%–24%). Regional control measures for solvent use and mobile emissions are effective for reducing O3 concentration. In the PRD region, self-contribution is more significant in daytime (∼40%) than in nighttime (∼10%) on average. Among the source regions outside PRD, the northern part of Guangdong province, Jiangxi province, and Fujian province are important contributors. Within the PRD region, the self-contribution of each city increases by 12%–32% during O3 episodes (&gt;80 ppbv) compared with the annual mean contribution. The contribution of the entire PRD region and the entire Guangdong province is 46%–63% and 63%–74% in PRD cities during O3 episodes. These results indicate that regional collaboration on emission control within PRD or Guangdong province is effective for reducing O3 episodes in the PRD region. In addition, because long-range transport from regions outside Guangdong province played an important role in the O3 concentration in the PRD region, long-term emission control measures throughout China in subsequent years should be propitious to further reduce the annual O3 level and improve air quality in the PRD region. © 2019 Elsevier LtdCapsule: In the PRD region, long-range transport is important in general; however, the local and neighboring areas are significant contributors during episodes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","O3; Pearl river delta; Source apportionment","Air quality; Emission control; Gems; Ozone; Quality control; Regional planning; Rivers; Air quality prediction; Emission control measures; Fine particulate matter; Long range transport; Pearl River delta; Regional collaboration; Source apportionment; Three-dimensional numerical modeling; River pollution; ozone; ozone; air quality; concentration (composition); emission control; long range transport; modeling; ozone; particulate matter; source apportionment; air pollution control; air quality; Article; carbon footprint; China; climate change; concentration (parameter); mathematical model; ozone layer; prediction; river ecosystem; seasonal variation; air pollutant; air pollution; blood; chemical model; city; environmental monitoring; industry; particulate matter; procedures; river; season; theoretical model; China; Guangdong; Guangdong; Zhujiang Delta; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Industry; Models, Chemical; Models, Theoretical; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Rivers; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068994100

If environmentally-friendly catalysts capable of efficient operation at lower temperatures could be developed that used a reductant other than NH3, the issues with current state-of-the-art SCR could be significantly lessened. To address this, activated carbon (AC) supported copper oxide-based catalysts for SCR while using C2H4 as a reductant was developed. Reaction testing of catalysts demonstrated high initial NO conversion with steeply declining activity over 2 hr of testing when C2H4 was used as the reductant. In comparison, with the same catalyst and NH3 as the reductant, stable, long-term NO conversion was observed, but at a lower rate than the initial reactivity with C2H4. Catalyst characterization studies were performed to assess deactivation mechanisms when C2H4 was the reductant. The analytical results showed the surface area and porosity of the catalyst remained unchanged and the initially highly-dispersed Cu species became agglomerated and more crystalline during reaction testing. Also, carbon black was detected on the catalyst surface after testing, presumably formed during the decomposition of C2H4. Both agglomeration of the active Cu species and blockage by carbon deposits would decrease the availability of active sites and lead to decreased catalytic activity.","activated carbon; catalytic activity; deactivation mechanism; hydrocarbon reductant; SCR","Activated carbon; Agglomeration; Ammonia; Carbon black; Catalyst deactivation; Catalyst poisoning; Copper oxides; Porosity; Scanning electron microscopy; Steam generators; Surface testing; Thyristors; Waste heat; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Activated carbon supported; Catalyst characterization; Deactivated catalysts; Deactivation mechanism; Heat recovery steam generators; Lower temperatures; Reductants; Temperature-programmed reduction; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069827687

Recent advances through catalyst development have significantly improved selectivity and activity. However, drawing potential dependent structure-activity relationships has been complicated, not only due to the ill-defined and intricate morphological and mesoscopic structure of electrocatalysts, but also by immense concentration gradients existing between the electrode surface and bulk solution. In this work, by using in situ surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and computational modeling, we explicitly show that commonly used strong phosphate buffers cannot sustain the interfacial pH during CO2 electroreduction on copper electrodes at relatively low current densities, &lt;10 mA/cm2. The pH near the electrode surface was observed to be as much as 5 pH units higher compared to bulk solution in 0.2 M phosphate buffer at potentials relevant to the formation of hydrocarbons (-1 V vs RHE), even on smooth polycrystalline copper electrodes. Drastically increasing the buffer capacity did not stand out as a viable solution for the problem as the concurrent production of hydrogen increased dramatically, which resulted in a breakdown of the buffer in a narrow potential range. These unforeseen results imply that most of the studies, if not all, on electrochemical CO2 reduction to hydrocarbons in CO2 saturated aqueous solutions were evaluated under mass transport limitations on copper electrodes. We underscore that the large concentration gradients on electrodes with high local current density (e.g., nanostructured) have important implications on the selectivity, activity, and kinetic analysis, and any attempt to draw structure-activity relationships must rule out mass transport effects. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Alkalinity; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Copper; Electrocatalysts; Electrolytic reduction; Hydrocarbons; Hydrogen production; Implants (surgical); Infrared spectroscopy; Light absorption; Pollution control; Carbon dioxide reduction; Concentration gradients; Mass transport limitation; Polycrystalline copper; Production of hydrogen; Situ infrared spectroscopy; Structure activity relationships; Surface enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy; Electrochemical electrodes; carbon dioxide; alkalinity; Article; carbon dioxide electroreduction; controlled study; electrochemical analysis; infrared spectroscopy; simulation; surface property",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073082709

However, in order to implement the stricter target of sulfur dioxide emission reduction during the 13th “Five-Year Plan” period, it is necessary to find a new solution as quickly as possible. Thus, it is of great practical significance to identify driving factors of regional sulfur dioxide emissions to formulate more reasonable emission reduction policies. In this paper, a distinctive decomposition approach, the generalized Divisia index method (GDIM), is employed to investigate the driving forces of regional industrial sulfur dioxide emissions in Jiangsu province and its three regions during 2004–2016. The contribution rates of each factor to emission changes are also assessed. The decomposition results demonstrate that: (i) the factors promoting the increase of industrial sulfur dioxide emissions are the economic scale effect, industrialization effect, and energy consumption effect, while technology effect, energy mix effect, sulfur efficiency effect, energy intensity effect, and industrial structure effect play a mitigating role in the emissions; (ii) energy consumption effect, energy mix effect, technology effect, sulfur efficiency effect, and industrial structure effect show special contributions in some cases; (iii) industrial structure effect and energy intensity effect need to be further optimized. © 2019 by the authors.

Characterized by discrete patches of high-elevation montane habitat, these “sky islands” serve as stepping stones across a “sea” of desert scrub/grassland. Over this coming century, the region is expected to shift towards a warmer and drier climate. We used species distribution modelling to predict how the spatial distribution of montane habitat will be affected by climate change. Location: Madrean Sky Island Archipelago, south-west United States and north-west Mexico (latitude, 29–34°N; longitude, 107–112°W). Methods: To approximate the current distribution of montane habitat, we built species distribution models for five high-elevation species (Ceanothus fendleri, Pinus strobiformis, Quercus gambelii, Sciurus aberti, and Synuchus dubius). The resulting models were projected under multiple climate change scenarios—four greenhouse gas concentration trajectories (RCP 2.6, 4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) for each of three climate models (CCSM4, MPI-ESM-LR, and NorESM1-M)—to generate predicted distributions for the years 2050 and 2070. We performed chi-squared tests to detect any future changes to total montane habitat area, and Conover–Iman tests to evaluate isolation among the discrete montane habitat patches. Results: While the climate models differ with respect to their predictions as to how severe the effects of future climate change will be, they all agree that by as early as year 2050, there will be significant montane habitat loss and increased montane habitat patch isolation across the Madrean Archipelago region under a worst-case climate change scenario (RCP 8.5). Main conclusions: Our results suggest that under 21st-century climate change, the Madrean Sky Islands will become increasingly isolated due to montane habitat loss. This may affect their ability to serve as stepping stones and have negative implications for the region's biodiversity. © 2019 The Authors.

Ice core and ocean sediment data have shown that atmospheric carbon dioxide, Antarctic temperature, deep ocean temperature, and global ice volume correlated strongly with each other in the 100k world2–6. Between about 2.8 and 1.2 million years ago, glacial cycles were smaller in magnitude and shorter in duration (‘40k world’7). Proxy data from deep-sea sediments suggest that the variability of atmospheric carbon dioxide in the 40k world was also lower than in the 100k world8–10, but we do not have direct observations of atmospheric greenhouse gases from this period. Here we report the recovery of stratigraphically discontinuous ice more than two million years old from the Allan Hills Blue Ice Area, East Antarctica. Concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane in ice core samples older than two million years have been altered by respiration, but some younger samples are pristine. The recovered ice cores extend direct observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide, methane, and Antarctic temperature (based on the deuterium/hydrogen isotope ratio δDice, a proxy for regional temperature) into the 40k world. All climate properties before eight hundred thousand years ago fall within the envelope of observations from continuous deep Antarctic ice cores that characterize the 100k world. However, the lowest measured carbon dioxide and methane concentrations and Antarctic temperature in the 40k world are well above glacial values from the past eight hundred thousand years. Our results confirm that the amplitudes of glacial–interglacial variations in atmospheric greenhouse gases and Antarctic climate were reduced in the 40k world, and that the transition from the 40k to the 100k world was accompanied by a decline in minimum carbon dioxide concentrations during glacial maxima. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"carbon dioxide; ice; methane; atmospheric gas; concentration (composition); glacial-interglacial cycle; ice core; magnitude; methane; paleoatmosphere; paleoclimate; proxy climate record; Antarctica; Article; climate; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; glacial period; greenhouse gas; interglacial; Pleistocene; Pliocene; priority journal; stratigraphy; temperature; Allan Hills; Antarctica; East Antarctica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074204520

Despite the progress in energy efficiency, the growth in energy demand still exceeds the efficiency improvements. This study adopts nonparametric methods to estimate the total factor energy efficiency (TFEE) of 105 resource-based cities covering the period 2010–2016 in China and analyzes the spatiotemporal characteristics of changes in energy efficiency. Furthermore, panel quantile regression is applied to analyze the multiple impacts of economic level, industrial structure, resource endowment, energy price, government intervention and degree of openness on energy efficiency. The main findings are as follows. (1) Each determinant has a different influence on TFEE at different levels; among them, the influence of the fuel and energy price index show an inverted U-shaped distribution as the quantile increases, and that of the GDP per capita shows a stronger heterogeneity than those of other factors. (2) Resource-based cities with lower efficiency are more sensitive to government intervention than are cities with higher efficiency. (3) A city's openness has a negative effect on TFEE, which partly supports the pollution haven hypothesis: the more foreign investment a resource-based city receives, the lower its energy and technology efficiency. Finally, some practical suggestions for the sustainable development of resource-based cities are discussed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Nonparametric analysis; Quantile panel regression; Resource-based city; Urban sustainability","Environmental management; Investments; Pollution; Regression analysis; Sustainable development; Environmental pollutions; Non-parametric analysis; Pollution haven hypothesis; Quantile panel regression; Resource-based city; Spatiotemporal characteristics; Total factor energy efficiencies; Urban sustainability; Energy efficiency; fuel; energy efficiency; energy market; industrial structure; regression analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; state role; sustainability; sustainable development; Article; China; economic development; energy conservation; energy resource; environmental sustainability; nonparametric test; priority journal; regression analysis; resource management; sustainable development; urbanization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067195856

Thus, there is a need to incorporate multiple-channel distribution in the network design of supply chains (SCs). Design/methodology/approach: A multiple-channel distribution supply chain network (MCDSCN) has been proposed under omnichannel environment. This proposed model integrates online giants with local retailer’s distribution network in an uncertain environment with sustainability. To incorporate sustainability, an objective function is added to reduce carbon content along with other objectives of minimization of SC cost. The model turns out to be mixed-integer linear programming model which is coded in GAMS and solved using CPLEX solver. Findings: The proposed MCDSCN model is compared with conventional SCN. Furthermore, it was found that the proposed MCDSCN model has achieved significant saving in SC cost and is also more sustainable than conventional SCN. The proposed model also enables online giants to integrate their distribution network with local retailer’s distribution network. Practical implications: Through proposed model, customers are free to access product and services as per their choice of channels which increases their convenience, reach and satisfaction. Originality/value: The proposed MCDSCN model is a novel approach to design flexible distribution systems. This would significantly help organizations to design their distribution network more effectively to meet global competition. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Distribution channels; Optimization; Supply chain management; Supply networks; Uncertainty","Customer satisfaction; Integer programming; Optimization; Sales; Supply chain management; Bi-objective optimization; Design/methodology/approach; Distribution channel; Mixed integer linear programming model; Supply networks; Sustainable supply chains; Uncertain environments; Uncertainty; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85054011213

Environmental changes require to minimize the measure of CO2 in air. The capture, storage and utilization of carbon based on photochemical, biochemical and electrochemical processes are the innovative proposed methods to decrease utilization of nonrenewables such as coal and oil. CO2 can be reduced chemically through either homogeneous or heterogeneous pathway. In general, photochemical transformation of CO2 involves formation of carrier charges followed by its separation, transportation and finally reduction of CO2 using generated photoelectrons. Photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide is a rising territory of research. Beginning from the premise of photocatalytic reduction, the investigations about different semiconducting frameworks like oxides, sulfides, and phosphides are considered in this review. Biochemical transformation deals with enzymatic conversion of CO2 and electrochemical reduction uses electrical energy for converting CO2 into its reduced form. The enzyme catalytic carbon dioxide change gives an eco-accommodating approach to make carbon-based chemical products. A few favorable circumstances related with enzymatic change incorporate high selectivity, high return, less quantity of waste, less response conditions however certain downsides, for example, staggering expense of catalysts and cofactors, and longer response times as contrasted and normal strategies. Some products obtained as a result of CO2 reduction includes methanol, formic acid, CO, methane, ethylene and gasoline.

This study distinguishes the interannual variations of the mid- to high-latitude and low-latitude components of SAH to obtain further understanding of SAH variations. By means of composite analysis, this study investigates the characteristics of the northern and southern mode of SAH variation (N-SAH, S-SAH). When the SAH is regarded as an entirety (E-SAH) based on numerous previous studies, it strengthens distinctly and expands toward both meridional and zonal directions in strong E-SAH comparing to weak E-SAH. The geopotential height (HGT) and tropospheric temperature (TT) anomalies related to the E-SAH are concurrently observed over the low-latitude and mid- to high-latitude regions. In contrast, when N-SAH and S-SAH are defined in this study, the SAH is distinctly strengthened only over its northern (southern) side and expands northward (southward) in strong N-SAH (S-SAH) comparing to the weak group. The HGT and TT anomalies related to the N-SAH (S-SAH) cases are limited over the mid- to high-latitude (low-latitude) regions. Possible impacted factors related to E-SAH, N-SAH, and S-SAH are further analyzed. The N-SAH is closely associated with precipitation anomalies over Indian Peninsula, meridional circulation over Tibet Plateau (TP), land surface temperature (LST) anomalies over Indian Peninsula and northern TP, meridional LST gradient between Indian Peninsula and northern TP, and circumglobal teleconnection (CGT). For instance, positive rainfall anomalies together with obviously ascending motion over Indian Peninsula contributes to a decreased LST anomalies via cloud-radiation feedback here, which forms a north-to-south LST gradient. The LST gradient will reduce the climatological south-to-north LST gradient here, which in turn contributes to a northward meridional circulation over northern TP, and finally contribute to a strong N-SAH existing over north of 25°N. Furthermore, the positive rainfall anomalies over Indian Peninsula tends to inspire a strong CGT over mid-high latitude through atmospheric response to condensation latent heating source, which in turn contributes to a strong N-SAH. In contrast, the meridional circulation associated with S-SAH is exhibited by southward shifting over southern TP (south of 30°N) due to atmospheric response to heating source generated by significant SST anomalies over Indian Ocean. Obviously warm center is observed in low-upper troposphere from tropical region to southern TP, which finally result in a strong S-SAH, accompanied by shifting southward. However, variation of E-SAH is a result of the combined action of rainfall anomalies over Indian Peninsula and SST anomalies over Indian Ocean. These differences indicate that it is necessary and of scientific significance to distinguish the northern and southern mode of the SAH. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CGT; ENSO; LST; Meridional circulation; Northern and southern mode; Rainfall; South Asian High","annual variation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; geopotential; land surface; meridional circulation; rainfall; surface temperature; temperature anomaly; troposphere; China; India; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066487947

We narrow this knowledge gap by modelling adaptation as a three-stage process where a farmer sequentially decides: (i) whether there is a need for adaptation; (ii) whether there are constraints that prevent adaptation; and (iii) whether such constraints are removed through government support. We develop a triple-hurdle model to describe this decision-making process and empirically estimate the impact of government support using a rural household survey from Guangdong Province, China. It is found that government support is positively associated with raising the odds of adaptation by about one quarter. This magnitude is larger than the estimates in recent literature, suggesting government support is more effective for farmers bound by constraints. Therefore, for cost-effective policy outcomes there is a need to identify the constraints and the farmers facing them. © 2019 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.","China; climate change adaptation; constraint; governmental support; triple-hurdle model","adaptive management; climate change; decision making; modeling; smallholder; state role; China; Guangdong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068513162

To better understand this biotransformation route under different geochemical conditions, the influence of sulfate on dechlorination in sediments from the Hudson River and the Grasse River spiked with two PCB mixtures (PCB 5/12, 64/71, 105/114 and 149/153/170 in Mixture 1 and PCB 5/12, 64/71, 82/97/99, 144/170 in Mixture 2) was investigated. The results showed that PCB dechlorination was partially inhibited in the sulfate-amended sediment microcosms. The rate, extent and preference of dechlorination were mainly controlled by the indigenous differences (sulfate, carbon content etc.) in sediment, but also affected by the PCB mixture composition. An increase of Dehalococcoides 16S rRNA genes coincided with the resumption of dechlorination. Dechlorination preferences were identified using a modified dechlorination pathway analysis approach. The low carbon content and high background sulfate Hudson sediment exhibited more para dechlorination targeting flanked para chlorines. The high carbon content and low background sulfate Grasse sediment preferentially removed more para-flanked meta chlorines than flanked para chlorines. The supplementation of fatty acids (acetate or a mixture of acetate, propionate and butyrate) dramatically increased PCB dechlorination in the Grasse sediment by resuming ortho-flanked meta dechlorination. Rare ortho removals were found in the Grasse sediment after adding fatty acids. This study suggests that supplementary fatty acids might be used to stimulate PCB dechlorination under sulfate reducing conditions, but the effectiveness largely depends on sediment geochemistry. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon source; Dehalococcoides; Electron acceptor; Ortho removal; Pathway; PCB dechlorination","Chlorine; Dechlorination; Geochemistry; Mixtures; Organic pollutants; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Rivers; RNA; Sulfur compounds; Volatile fatty acids; Carbon source; Dehalococcoides; Electron acceptor; Fatty acid supplementation; Pathway; Polychlorinated biphenyl (PCBs); Sediment geochemistries; Sulfate-reducing conditions; Sediments; acetic acid; biphenyl; butyric acid; carbon; chlorine; fatty acid; polychlorinated biphenyl derivative; propionic acid; RNA 16S; sulfate; fatty acid; polychlorinated biphenyl; sulfate; bacterium; biotransformation; dechlorination; electron; fatty acid; fluvial deposit; inhibition; PCB; reduction; sediment chemistry; sulfate; aquatic environment; Article; bioremediation; biotransformation; dechlorination; dredging; geochemistry; microcosm; river; sediment; chemistry; Chloroflexi; ecosystem restoration; genetics; halogenation; metabolism; microbiology; New York; procedures; river; sediment; water pollutant; Grasse River; Hudson River; New York [United States]; United States; Dehalococcoides; Biodegradation, Environmental; Chloroflexi; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Fatty Acids; Geologic Sediments; Halogenation; New York; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Rivers; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sulfates; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067042935

Given that many traditional static planning strategies are not working with unpredictable future conditions, the possibility of system failure, and the lock-in effects, the Adaptation Pathway (AP) approach was adopted for dynamically robust and cost-effective planning in this paper. In order to increase optimization accuracy of multi-staged planning, a continuous definition of the AP optimization problem was raised by improving the simplified versions in existing studies. A case study in Suzhou, a provincial pilot Sponge City in China undergoing increasing annual rainfall and severe water environment deterioration, was included by integrating Long-Term Hydrologic Impact Assessment-Low Impact Development model with optimization methods, aiming to persistently control the non-point source total phosphorus loading below an acceptable amount in the following unforeseen 20 years via multi-staged low-impact development (LID) construction. A novel optimization method developed by the authors in a companion paper, namely marginal-cost-based greedy strategy (MCGS), was successfully applied to efficiently solve the continuous version of the AP optimization problem. The popular genetic algorithm (GA) was used as a contrast. A weather generator was elaborated based on four Representative Concentration Pathway scenarios and 17 spatial downscaled general circulation models to simulate the unforeseen future annual rainfalls that helped with evaluating cost effectiveness of each prospective LID plan. Results showed that the adaptation pathways optimized by MCGS could save the whole life net present cost of an LID plan by 1%–60% compared with those optimized by GA, and the computational efficiency of MCGS was over 13 times faster than GA. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation pathway; Climate change; Deep uncertainty; Greedy strategy; Low-impact development; Robust decision making","adaptive management; climate change; decision making; environmental impact; genetic algorithm; optimization; planning process; sustainable development; uncertainty analysis; adaptation; Article; China; climate change; genetic algorithm; sustainable development; city; prospective study; social aspect; uncertainty; China; Cities; Climate Change; Prospective Studies; Social Planning; Uncertainty",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069433590

In this study, various techniques such as cointegration analysis, vector autoregression, and decoupling elastic function methods are applied to analyze the sequential collaborative relationship between economic development and carbon emissions in the process of urbanization in terms of the time-series lag relationship and the decoupling relationship. The main findings are as follows: (1) urbanization and carbon emissions displayed a temporal correlation relation with a lag of order 4, according to stability tests, and (2) the development of urbanization, economic growth, and changes in land use may be responsible for the time lag in carbon emissions. Furthermore, the mechanisms behind the effect of urbanization on carbon emissions are investigated to assist future carbon emissions reduction efforts. (3) From 1990 to 2014, carbon emissions and economic development showed a temporal evolution trend of “weak decoupling–expansionary coupling–weak decoupling” in the Pearl River Delta region, and there was an overall weak decoupling state: carbon emissions increased with growth in economic development, but the emissions growth rate was lower than the speed of economic development. (4) From 1990 to 2014, economic development showed a trend of sustained growth in the Pearl River Delta region, and differences were detected in the decoupling status between carbon emissions and economic development at different times. The overall decoupling status of the nine cities in the region was one of weak decoupling; however, the decoupling index, carbon emissions, and economic development levels displayed differences, whereby cities with high carbon emissions and high economic development levels were not necessarily the cities in which environmental pressures from economic development were the most severe.

We use scenario analysis and the InVEST model to assess individual or combined impacts of climate and land cover on water retention in the Upper Yangtze River Basin. Water retention decreased from 1986 to 2015 at a rate of 2.97 mm/10a in response to increasing precipitation (3.94 mm/10a) and potential evapotranspiration (16.47 mm/10a). The rate of water retention change showed regional variability (from 68 to -18 mm/a), with some eastern regions experiencing an increase and most other regions experiencing a decrease. Farmland showed the highest decrease (10,772 km2), with land mainly converted into forest (58.17%) and shrub land (21.13%) from 2000 to 2015. The impact of climate change (-12.02 mm) on water retention generally was greater than the impact of land cover change (-4.14 mm), at the basin scale. Among 22 climate zones, 77.27% primarily were impacted by climate change; 22.73% primarily were impacted by land cover change. Our results demonstrate that both individualistic and integrated approaches toward climate and vegetation management is necessary to mitigate the impacts of climate change on water resources. © 2019 by the authors.","InVEST model; Regional differences; Relative contribution; Scenario analysis; Water yield","climate change; climate effect; ecosystem service; evapotranspiration; land cover; precipitation (climatology); scenario analysis; shrubland; water budget; water resource; water retention; China; Yangtze Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073411166

Previous ‘city-scale studies’ have investigated consumption-based emission accounting for demand-side mitigation analysis. However, to date very few studies have presented income-based emissions accounting for supply-side mitigation strategies at the level of an urban agglomeration. To fill this gap, this research begins by accounting for the income-based carbon footprint of the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) urban agglomeration. The 14 cities that make up the BTH region were grouped into 4 types in order to analyse the emission patterns of each and to identify both labour-intensive and carbon-efficient sectors. The results from this analysis are presented in a number of heatmaps, which show emission patterns, labour-capital ratios and carbon efficiencies. The industry relocation among the 14 cities is then discussed with regards to the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Coordinated Development Strategy. The results indicate that the service sector of Beijing, several mining sectors of resource-oriented cities and the electricity production for all of the cities are the most carbon-intensive sectors from an income-based perspective; the labour-intensive sectors are typically carbon-efficient, and the combination of supply-side carbon emissions, carbon efficiency and labour-to-capital ratio helps identify the key sectors for providing policy-makers the direction of industrial adjustment and relocation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region; Ghosh model; Input-output analysis; Supply-side emissions; Urban agglomeration","carbon; agglomeration; carbon footprint; climate change; electricity generation; emissions trading; environmental economics; income distribution; input-output analysis; mining industry; relocation; urban area; Article; carbon footprint; China; city; economic development; income; mining; urban area; China; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin; Beijing; Carbon; Carbon Footprint; China; Cities",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068989559

A carbon-tungsten mixed target material is used for both inter-and intra-ELM simulations. The OEDGE results reveal that the inter-ELM tungsten gross erosion rate is not sensitive to the carbon fraction on the tungsten surface layer; a wider range of carbon fractions from 0.3 to 0.6 gives similar tungsten gross erosion profiles and matches the diagnostic data, which is consistent with the simple analytical model. However, the intra-ELM simulation indicates that the value of the surface carbon fraction can be as low as 0.3 to reproduce the measured tungsten gross erosion during ELMs, based on the effective ionizations/photon (S/XB) value of WI emissions. For both inter-and intra-ELM cases, carbon is predicted to dominate the tungsten erosion. However, in contrast to the inter-ELM tungsten erosion, which is dominated by locally redeposited C2+, the energetic C6+ originating from the pedestal can contribute substantial tungsten erosion in the near-separatrix region during ELMs, and the width of this C6+ dominated region exhibits a negative correlation with the heat flux density carried by ELMs. © 2019 IAEA, Vienna.","ELM; fusion; plasma materials interaction; tungsten erosion","Carbon; Erosion; Fusion reactions; Heat flux; Plasma theory; DIII-D H-mode discharges; Edgelocalized modes; Heat flux densities; Impurity distribution; Negative correlation; Performance discharges; Plasma-materials interaction; Tungsten erosion; Tungsten",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076745268

China is experiencing rapid urbanization and facing huge inequality in regional development and then shrinking cities generate. This study, for the first time, discusses long-term CO2 emission patterns of shrinking cities with comparisons of growing cities. 55 cities in Northeast China and the Yangtze River Delta are selected as cases. We first categorize these cities into three groups of shrinking cities and three groups of growing cities with a population index. Each group's emission patterns in terms of energy, employment and industry structures are then examined. We find that CO2 emissions in the rapidly shrinking group presented a continuously increasing trend, while the other five groups reached their emission peaks in 2011–2013. For slightly and moderately shrinking groups, CO2 emission mitigation was a positive sign but occurred with the decline of secondary industry, especially for resource-based or heavy manufacturing cities, such as Daqing and Anshan in Northeast China. In the case of three types of growing cities, cities were capable of mitigating CO2 emissions and maintaining economic growth. The slightly growing group was the optimal type among these six groups. Its CO2 emissions experienced a decline with an annual rate of −1.47% during 2013–2015, while the economy still soared (increased by 7.27% annually). New economic growth points should be fostered to mitigate further shrinkage and achieve sustainable development for shrinking cities. The cities’ categorization rules, research thinking, and results offered in this study could provide a reference for other cities or developing countries at similar industrialization/urbanization phases to abbreviate their path towards a low-carbon economy. © 2019 The Authors","China; CO2 emissions; Growing city; Population; Shrinking city; Urbanization","Carbon dioxide; Developing countries; Regional planning; China; CO2 emissions; Population; Shrinking city; Urbanization; Industrial economics; carbon emission; developing world; economic growth; environmental economics; manufacturing; population growth; regional development; sustainable development; urban growth; urban population; urbanization; China; Yangtze River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066297282

Recent studies suggest that soil microbial communities may mediate the impacts of resource availability on plant performance, yet little is known about the net effect of conspecific soil microorganisms for tree seedling light responses. Here we examined the interactive effects of light availability and presence of conspecific soil microorganisms on tree seedling growth, morphology and nutrient content for two congeneric tropical tree species. The two Bauhinia tree species with contrasting shade tolerance were grown in sterilized or unsterilized soil medium, under either high (50%) or low (10%) light conditions in a greenhouse experiment. Plant light responses and soil feedback effects were determined after 12 weeks. Results showed that the light-demanding tree species was generally more responsive to both light and soil microbes compared with its shade-tolerant congener. Presence of soil microbes enhanced plant growth and biomass responses to increased light availability for the light-demanding species alone, driven by positive soil feedback effects in high light. Six plant traits (leaf mass fraction, stem mass fraction, specific stem length, leaf phosphorus concentration, leaf nitrogen: phosphorus ratio and root nitrogen: phosphorus ratio) showed significant interactive effects between light and soil treatment. Observed changes to leaf biomass allocation in response to light in the presence of conspecific soil microorganisms were consistent with optimality theory and adjustments to maximize resource acquisition under different light conditions. In addition, presence of soil microbes decreased the average plasticity of plant nutrient content and stoichiometry in response to light for the light-demanding Bauhinia species. Together these results highlight the importance of conspecific soil microbes for plant-light relations, with implications for plant-plant interactions and species coexistence. © 2019","Bauhinia brachycarpa; Bauhinia variegata; Functional traits; Growth rates; Light intensity; Nitrogen; Phosphorus; Plant-Soil feedback; Seedling morphology","biomass allocation; community dynamics; dicotyledon; forest ecosystem; growth rate; light intensity; microbial community; morphology; nitrogen; phosphorus; plant community; seedling; shade tolerance; soil microorganism; soil-vegetation interaction; tree; tropical environment; Bauhinia; Bauhinia variegata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069567081

Herein, a 0D hematite quantum dots/2D ultrathin g-C3N4 nanosheets hybrid (Fe2O3 QDs/g-C3N4 NS) is developed via a facile chemical reaction and subsequent low-temperature calcination. As expected, the specially designed 0D/2D structure shows remarkable catalytic performance toward the removal of p-nitrophenol. By virtue of large surface area, adequate active sites, and strong interfacial coupling, the 0D Fe2O3 QDs/2D g-C3N4 nanosheets establish efficient charge transport paths by local in-plane carbon species, expediting the separation and transfer of electron/hole pairs. Simultaneously, highly efficient charge mobility can lead to continuous and fast Fe(III)/Fe(II) conversion, promoting a cooperative effect between the photocatalysis and chemical activation of H2O2.

Applying gradient boosting decision trees to the data from the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area, this study addresses two gaps in the literature by identifying critical built environment determinants of CO2 emissions, and more importantly, illustrating threshold effects of built environment elements. The results show that three neighborhood-level built environment factors have the strongest influences on CO2 emissions: distance to the nearest transit stop, job density, and land use diversity. The distance to downtowns also has a substantial impact. This study further confirms that built environment variables are effective only within a certain range. These threshold effects offer valuable implications for planners to achieve desirable environmental benefits efficiently. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions; Machine learning; Travel behavior; Urban form","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Decision trees; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Learning systems; Planning; Trees (mathematics); Urban planning; Built environment; Carbon dioxide emissions; Environmental benefits; Gradient boosting; Land use diversity; Metropolitan area; Travel behaviors; Urban form; Sustainable development; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; greenhouse gas; land use planning; machine learning; metropolitan area; threshold; transportation planning; urban transport; Minneapolis; Minnesota; Saint Paul; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070996679

The system is most efficient for manure with less than 12% total solids content. Results also show that the liquid region above the cooling pipes features one-dimensional transient heat transfer formed by unique flow patterns. A simplified analytical model is derived to predict the surface temperature of liquid manure. The analytical solution shows that the manure surface temperature can be reduced by 7.4 and 12 °C after 2 and 5 h, respectively.

In addition, the surface properties were also investigated to determine ability to adsorb aqueous ammonium ion. The micropore volume was always the lowest amongst pore diameters, but increasing pyrolysis temperature remarkably increased micropore volume in concentration by 1000 folds when temperature was raised to 700 °C. This supported the surface area increase with associated loss of surface functional groups. It was also accompanied with 50% and 33% reduction in condensable liquid hydrocarbon content in OSR and SWP biochars, respectively. This further reflected on the reduction in liquid hydrocarbon content and total PAH content from 0.5 to less than 0.1 mg Kg−1 in OSR and from 4.4 to 0.2 mg Kg−1 in SWP biochar, Nevertheless, OSR showed higher surface functionality compared to SWP biochars by adsorbing higher concentrations of ammonium ion within the mesopore region.

Although the Nigerian energy policy (2005) stipulated increased deployment of renewable energy technologies, concern remains about the implementations and public acceptance of the technologies. Unless the factors that constitute barriers to public adoption are identified and addressed, successful deployment of these technologies will be unattainable. This paper discusses the technical barriers to acceptance of RETs in the understanding of the Nigerian populace. The study was carried out in Oyo State of Nigeria. Using a convergent parallel mixed-method research approach, data was collected via a survey (quantitative) and focus group interviews (qualitative). There was a survey of 600 participants and four focus group interviews conducted including 23 participants. Four common technical themes emerged from the data: accessibility, complexity, maintenance, and durability. Unless the factors that constitute barriers to public adoption of the technologies are identified and addressed, successful deployment of these technologies will be unattainable.

However, only a limited number of studies to date have investigated intrinsic brain network organisation in people with Down's syndrome, none of which addressed the links between functional connectivity and Alzheimer's disease. In this cross-sectional study, we employed 11C-Pittsburgh Compound-B (PiB) positron emission tomography in order to group participants with Down's syndrome based on the presence of fibrillar beta-amyloid neuropathology. We also acquired resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data to interrogate the connectivity of the default mode network; a large-scale system with demonstrated links to Alzheimer's disease. The results revealed widespread positive connectivity of the default mode network in people with Down's syndrome (n = 34, ages 30–55, median age = 43.5) and a stark lack of anti-correlation. However, in contrast to typically developing controls (n = 20, ages 30–55, median age = 43.5), the Down's syndrome group also showed significantly weaker connections in localised frontal and posterior brain regions. Notably, while a comparison of the PiB-negative Down's syndrome group (n = 19, ages 30–48, median age = 41.0) to controls suggested that alterations in default mode connectivity to frontal brain regions are related to atypical development, a comparison of the PiB-positive (n = 15, ages 39–55, median age = 48.0) and PiB-negative Down's syndrome groups indicated that aberrant connectivity in posterior cortices is associated with the presence of Alzheimer's disease neuropathology. Such distinct profiles of altered connectivity not only further our understanding of the brain physiology that underlies these two inherently linked conditions but may also potentially provide a biomarker for future studies of neurodegeneration in people with Down's syndrome. © 2019 The Authors.

However, the majority of the subsurface storage capacity is in saline aquifers, for which there is relatively little information. Published estimates of the potential storage capacity of such formations, based on limited data, often give no indication of the uncertainty, despite there being substantial uncertainty associated with the data used to calculate such estimates. Here, we test the hypothesis that the uncertainty in such estimates is a significant proportion of the estimated storage capacity, and should hence be evaluated as a part of any assessment. Using only publicly available data, a group of 13 experts independently estimated the storage capacity of seven regional saline aquifers. The experts produced a wide range of estimates for each aquifer due to a combination of using different published values for some variables and differences in their judgements of the aquifer properties such as area and thickness. The range of storage estimates produced by the experts shows that there is significant uncertainty in such estimates; in particular, the experts' range does not capture the highest possible capacity estimates. This means that by not accounting for uncertainty, such regional estimates may underestimate the true storage capacity. The result is applicable to single values of storage capacity of regional potential but not to detailed studies of a single storage site. © 2019 American Institute of Physics Inc..

The aim of California contemporary energy policy in general, and the state's building codes and standards in particular, is the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The state has identified residential designs that ""bring value to the grid"" as a key constituent of this effort. This research quantifies the marginal costs that code requirements add to new residential construction, the quantity of carbon emissions and abatement expected at a statewide level, and the marginal abatement cost of homes built under the new 2019 standards relative to those built under the prior code. We model hourly energy consumption and emissions (2020-2050) for seven residential building types representative of California production housing for each of California's 16 climate zones. Costs and benefits of each housing type are analyzed under a 30-year timeframe. Our results indicate that the 2019 code allows for a wide range of emission profiles, including very high long-term emissions resulting from the use of natural gas and under high leak rates. The significant and previously unreported impact of pre-meter natural gas leaks emphasizes the challenges that natural gas creates with respect to meeting California's long-term GHG reduction goals. Marginal abatement costs are dependent on natural gas leak rates, but consistently indicate that all-electric homes represent the first-best policy option for residential sector GHG abatement in California.

Geographic variations in PM may explain the lack of consistent associations with breast cancer. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to evaluate the relationship between air pollution, PM components, and breast cancer risk in a United States-wide prospective cohort. METHODS: We estimated annual average ambient residential levels of particulate matter &lt;2:5 lm and &lt;10 lm in aerodynamic diameter (PM2:5 and PM10, respectively) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) using land-use regression for 47,433 Sister Study participants (breast cancer–free women with a sister with breast cancer) living in the contiguous United States. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for risk associated with an interquartile range (IQR) increase in pollutants. Predictive k-means were used to assign participants to clusters derived from PM2:5 component profiles to evaluate the impact of heterogeneity in the PM2:5 mixture. For PM2:5, we investigated effect measure modification by component cluster membership and by geographic region without regard to air pollution mixture. RESULTS: During follow-up (mean = 8:4 y), 2,225 invasive and 623 ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) cases were identified. PM2:5 and NO2 were associated with breast cancer overall [HR = 1:05 (95% CI:0.99, 1.11) and 1.06 (95% CI:1.02, 1.11), respectively] and with DCIS but not with invasive cancer. Invasive breast cancer was associated with PM2:5 only in the Western United States [HR = 1:14 (95% CI:1.02, 1.27)] and NO2 only in the Southern United States [HR = 1:16 (95% CI:1.01, 1.33)]. PM2:5 was associated with a higher risk of invasive breast cancer among two of seven identified composition-based clusters. A higher risk was observed [HR = 1:25 (95% CI: 0.97, 1.60)] in a California-based cluster characterized by low S and high Na and nitrate (NO3−) fractions and for another Western United States cluster [HR = 1:60 (95% CI: 0.90, 2.85)], characterized by high fractions of Si, Ca, K, and Al. CONCLUSION: Air pollution measures were related to both invasive breast cancer and DCIS within certain geographic regions and PM component clusters. © 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

We then estimate potential GHG reduction if the program was expanded nationwide. Materials and Methods: Travel distances in miles were calculated for each avoided patient transfer using hospital location data and ArcGIS® tools. Potential GHG reductions from program expansion were calculated based on state and national stroke Diagnosis-Related Groups (DRGs). Along with average flight distance from a rural hospital to closest level one trauma center. Results: Participation in the Access to Critical Cerebral Emergent Support Services (ACCESS) from May 2015 to July 2017 resulted in 2,020 consultations. Of these consultations, there was a 70% (1,414) reduction in patient transfers. Emission reduction totaled 618,772 kg of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) (618.77 metric tons) or 0.306 metric tons of CO2e per patient. Expanding the program across New Mexico and similar U.S. areas resulted in potential reductions of 4,307 (IQR 3,386-5,274) and 213,279 (IQR 169,320-263,570) metric tons of CO2e. Conclusion: Transport accounts for 26% of global CO2 emissions and is one of the few industrial sectors where emissions are still growing. What makes this study more impactful is that aviation's emissions are not part of the Kyoto Protocol and little is being done in this sector. GHG reduction was not the main intention of the ACCESS program, but it has shown to be a significant by-product. © 2019, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers.","e-health; emergency medicine/teletrauma; telemedicine; teleneurology","Carbon dioxide; Diagnosis; Emission control; Gas emissions; Hospitals; Program diagnostics; Telemedicine; Diagnosis related groups; Emergency medicine; Emission reduction; Greenhouse gas reductions; Industrial sector; Potential reduction; Support services; teleneurology; Greenhouse gases; air pollution; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; greenhouse gas; New Mexico; patient referral; prevention and control; rural population; telemedicine; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Gases; New Mexico; Referral and Consultation; Rural Population; Telemedicine; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072950575

The results of clustering and the decomposition are as follows: (1) the 18 prefecture-level cities in Henan were divided into five categories by spectral clustering, and there are similar development patterns within each category, so they can learn from each other to improve their own defects of development; (2) this paper utilizes the two-layer LMDI method to divide the factors affecting each cluster of carbon emissions into four types, which includes energy structure, energy intensity, per capita GDP, and population, and calculates the contribution value of each factor. It was concluded that the contribution value of per capita GDP dominantly drove up carbon emissions, while energy intensity played a significant role in offsetting them. Therefore, it is important for Henan’s low-carbon development to control the expansion of economic activity and improve energy efficiency in the future. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Emissions reduction strategy; Henan; Spectral cluster; Two-layer LMDI","carbon emission; cluster analysis; decomposition analysis; economic activity; emission control; energy efficiency; energy intensity; Gross Domestic Product; spectral analysis; strategic approach; carbon; air pollution; China; city; cluster analysis; energy resource; greenhouse gas; gross national product; prevention and control; theoretical model; Air Pollution; Carbon; China; Cities; Cluster Analysis; Energy-Generating Resources; Greenhouse Gases; Gross Domestic Product; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070634195

As such, the phase rarely appears on phase diagrams of the group VB transition metal carbides. There is currently renewed interest in this phase, as tantalum carbide composites exhibit high fracture toughness in the presence of this phase. This work extends the initial computational study using density functional theory of the phase stability of the zeta phase in the tantalum carbide system, where the tantalum carbide zeta-phase crystal structure and stability were determined, to the niobium and vanadium carbides. It is shown that the zeta phases in the three systems share the same crystal structure and it is an equilibrium phase at low temperatures. The carbon atom ordering in the three different phases is explored and it is demonstrated that the zeta phase in the tantalum carbides prefers to order carbon atoms differently than in the niobium and vanadium carbide zeta phases. Finally, the properties of this crystal are computed, including elastic constants, electronic densities of states and phonon dispersion curves, to illustrate that this crystal structure is similar to other transition metal carbides. © 2019 International Union of Crystallography.","density functional theory; phase equilibria; transition metal carbides; ultrahigh temperature ceramics (UHTCs)","Carbides; Carbon; Computation theory; Density functional theory; Fracture toughness; Niobium compounds; Phase equilibria; Phase stability; Tantalum compounds; Transition metals; Vanadium compounds; Carbide composites; Computational investigation; Computational studies; Electronic density; Equilibrium phase; Phonon dispersion curves; Transition metal carbide; Ultra-high-temperature ceramics; Crystal structure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074372801

Climate change may affect agricultural production and possibly influence the grain self-sufficiency of some countries, threatening their food security. This article provides an updated integrated assessment of the impact of climate change on grain self-sufficiency at the country level. The study links climatic variables projected by global climate models to economic variables simulated by a global multiregion multisector economic model. Although climate change may considerably reduce land productivity, our simulation results show that climate change in the long term modestly impacts regional grain self-sufficiency, as the direct effects on yield are largely canceled out by changes in grain production via adaptation measures taken by producers in response to market signals. Behavioral changes of consumers also contribute modestly to cancel out the adverse impact on land productivity. In the RCP8.5 climate change scenario, the adverse impact of climate change on land productivity in 2100 may reach to 25% of the current level, but declines to 5% when changes in production and consumption are considered, thus indicating the role of long-term adaptation by economic agents. © 2019 The Authors.

This project evaluated the performance of a prototype solar-powered air monitoring system known as a Village Green Project (VGP) system with wireless data transmission that was deployed on a school rooftop in Hong Kong and operated for over one year. The system provided highly time-resolved and long-term data utilizing mid-tier cost ozone, PM2.5 and meteorological instruments. It operated with very minimal maintenance but shading by a nearby building reduced solar radiation, thus battery run time, over the 16-months measurement period, approximately 330,000 1-min observations were recorded (data completeness of ~62%). The monitoring data were evaluated by comparison with a nearby Hong Kong Environment Protection Department (EPD) station and exhibited good performance for 1-h resolution (R2 = 0.74 for PM2.5 and R2 = 0.76 for ozone). Furthermore as a demonstration, a nonparametric regression (NPR) model was applied for identifying the location of pollution source, combining air pollution and meteorological measurements. In addition, based on the high time-resolution wind data, local-scale back-trajectories were calculated as an input for receptor-oriented Nonparametric Trajectory Analysis (NTA) model. The combination of the VGP air monitoring system and NTA model identified apparent local sources in urban area. The demonstration was largely successful and operational improvements are clearly suggested to insure better siting and configurations to insure adequate power and air flow. © 2019","Air qualtiy; Community monitoring; Cost-effective; Pollution source","Air quality; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Meteorological instruments; Ozone; Pollution detection; Quality control; Solar energy; Tropics; Air qualtiy; Cost effective; Environment protection; Meteorological measurements; Non-parametric regression; Operational improvements; Pollution sources; Wireless data transmission; Monitoring; ozone; air quality; instrumentation; meteorology; monitoring system; particulate matter; performance assessment; pollutant source; subtropical region; urban area; urban pollution; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; airflow; Article; Hong Kong; particulate matter; priority journal; solar energy; solar radiation; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068857077

The adoption of lentil in production systems and in plant-based diets is a food system solution that can support the environmental, socio-economic, and human health dimensions of sustainability. The purpose of this study is to evaluate producer and consumer perceptions of the sustainability profile of the lentil system in Montana (USA), and the surrounding region that includes Idaho (USA), North Dakota (USA), Washington (USA), and Canada, in the context of global change. Surveys were conducted with lentil producers (n = 63; conventional n = 42, organic n = 15, and mixed management n = 6) and consumers (n = 138) in the rural state of Montana (USA). The most prevalent agronomic reason for including lentil in production systems reported by producers is to diversify crop rotation (92%). The most prevalent economic reasons for including lentil in rotation reported by producers is to capitalize on dryland production (95%) and to serve as a cash crop (87%). With respect to lentil consumption, the most prevalent health-related perceptions were that eating lentils helps to improve nutrition (88%), feel satiated or full (85%), and support a plant-based diet (81%). Consumers and non-consumers of lentils alike reported they would increase lentil consumption based on environmental (78%), economic (75%), and health and nutrition (72%) information contrasting lentils and animal-based protein sources. Overall, findings highlight how the lentil system supports multiple dimensions of sustainability based on the perspectives of study informants. Additionally, findings elucidate barriers and opportunities for promoting lentil in agricultural systems and diets. Impacts of market, policy, and climate change on lentil production, and lack of consumer knowledge on benefits of lentils to help meet food security through a sustainable diet, challenge sustainability dimensions of lentil in the food system. © Copyright © 2019 Warne, Ahmed, Byker Shanks and Miller.","consumption; food security; lentil; management practices; sustainability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077595596

Still, it will affect the competitiveness of specific industries, economic activity and employment across countries. This paper assesses short-term economic shocks following the introduction of a global carbon price that would be in line with the Paris Agreement. Based on the World Input-Output Database (WIOD), we trace the carbon content of final output through global supply chains. This allows us to estimate how prices of the final output would react to the introduction of a global carbon price. We find that impacts on industrial competitiveness are highly heterogeneous across regions and economic sectors.

Unfortunately, these methods scale quite unfavorably with the size of the system and are getting too time consuming—and too expensive—for larger molecules. In order to be able to treat larger organic molecules, we propose a novel scheme for a quick and reliable estimate of molecular correlation energies, which we call ESCAPE (EStimation of CorrelAtion energies by Pair Energies). It is based on the pair correlation energies for localized molecular orbitals that have been generated by CCSD[T] and fitted to suitable functional forms. All fit parameters are stored in a large parameter file. Aiming at chemical accuracy (±1 kcal/mol), we have first limited our approach to aliphatic hydrocarbons. The total molecular CCSD[T] correlation energies of a training set of 41 aliphatic hydrocarbons could be reproduced with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.56 kcal/mol or 0.11%. A similar accuracy could be obtained for a test set of 11 additional hydrocarbons with up to eight carbon atoms (MAE of 0.65 kcal/mol or 0.09%). In a more critical test, we checked the small energy differences for a set of 13 isomerization reactions. The comparison with experimental data showed that we could reach chemical accuracy as well. Our estimate (MAE of 0.55 kcal/mol) is slightly inferior to the CCSD[T] result (MAE of 0.17 kcal/mol), but superior to SCF, DFT/B3LYP, and DFT/B3LYP + D3. Moreover, in all cases, we obtained the correct sign, that is, the correct equilibrium structure. A similar accuracy could be reached in an application to the three lowest isomers of the C60 molecule. Using the example of a set of eight alcohols, we were able to proof the method's ability for molecules including heteroatoms. Three fast steps are necessary for the application to any aliphatic hydrocarbon or alcohol: (1) An SCF calculation at the selected molecular geometry; it can be fast since a medium size basis set is generally sufficient. (2) The localization of the occupied molecular orbitals and determination of their properties (center of charge and spatial extent).

This study aims to upscale the forest carbon estimates using GeoEye-1 image and small footprint lidar data from small areas to a landscape level using RapidEye image. Species stratification was carried out based on the spectral separability curve of GeoEye-1 image, and comparison of mean intensity and mean plot height of the trees from lidar data. GeoEye-1 image and lidar data were segmented using region growing approach to delineate individual tree crowns; and the segmented crowns (CPA) of tree were further used to establish a relationship with field measured carbon and total trees’ height. Carbon stock measured from field, individual tree crown (ITC) segmentation approach and area-based approach (ABA) was compared at plot level using one-way ANOVA and post hoc Tukey comparison test. ITC-based carbon estimates was used to establish a relationship with spectral reflectance of RapidEye image variables (NDVI, RedEdge NDVI, PC1, single band of RedEdge, and NIR) to upscale the carbon at landscape level. One-way ANOVA resulted in a highly significant difference (p-value &lt; 0.005) between the mean plot height and lidar intensity to stratify Shorea robusta and Other species successfully. ITC carbon stock estimation models of two major tree species explained about 88% and 79% of the variances, respectively, at 95% confidence level. The ABA estimated carbon was highly correlated (R2 = 0.83, RMSE = 20.04) to field measured carbon with higher accuracy than the ITC estimated carbon. A weak relationship was observed between the carbon stock and the RapidEye image variables.

The conventional alloy catalysts however lack precise control over the local atomic structures of active sites. Here we report on an investigation of the active-site ensemble effect in bimetallic Pd-Au electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction. A series of Pd@Au electrocatalysts are synthesized by decorating Au nanoparticles with Pd of controlled doses, giving rise to bimetallic surfaces containing Pd ensembles of various sizes. Their catalytic activity for electroreduction of CO2 to CO exhibits a nonlinear behavior in dependence of the Pd content, which is attributed to the variation of Pd ensemble size and the corresponding tuning of adsorption properties. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Pd@Au electrocatalysts with atomically dispersed Pd sites possess lower energy barriers for activation of CO2 than pure Au and are also less poisoned by strongly binding *CO intermediates than pure Pd, with an intermediate ensemble size of active sites, such as Pd dimers, giving rise to the balance between these two rate-limiting factors and achieving the highest activity for CO2 reduction.

The results indicate that the business registration reform has contributed to PM2.5 air pollution, with above-average impacts in central areas, but insignificant effects in western China. Furthermore, the treatment effects are stronger in cities with larger entry of small and medium enterprises and greater pressure to achieve targets for local GDP growth.

Regretfully, the impact of power-generating capacity and its utilization on carbon emissions in the power sector has not yet been addressed. In this study, we incorporate the interaction between capacity and utilization of power sector into the dynamic spatial Durbin model, and estimate the specific impact on carbon dioxide emissions from the power sector based on the panel data set of China’s provinces during 1991–2015. The results show that both installed capacity and utilization rate have positive effects on CO2 emissions. Interestingly, the estimation coefficient of their interaction term is negative, implying that the carbon emission reduction effect derives from the conflicting performance of capacity governance and utilization efficiency. Besides, the advantage of the emerging econometric method, the dynamic spatial Durbin model (SDM) with provinces and time-period fixed effects, is that it can estimate spatial interaction effects among the provinces and neighboring provinces and decompose those effects into two parts: long-term and short-term. However, the estimates indicate that only capacity has roughly significant spatial spillovers. As a result, dissolving overcapacity of thermal power generation and a necessary interprovincial coordination will promote carbon emission reduction rather than investing in coal-fired power plants, and the power authority should turn to alternative investment in cleaner power generation technologies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Capacity utilization; CO2 emissions; Dynamic spatial Durbin model; Overcapacity; Thermal power generation","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; data set; environmental effect; panel data; power generation; power plant; spatial analysis; thermal power; carbon dioxide; coal; air pollutant; China; electric power plant; electricity; energy resource; environment; theoretical model; Air Pollutants; Carbon Dioxide; China; Coal; Electricity; Energy-Generating Resources; Environment; Models, Theoretical; Power Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071450475

Based on the three perspectives of decomposition, decoupling, and prediction, this paper studies the feasibility of carbon emission peaks in eight major regional power sectors in China. First, the generalized Divisia index model (GDIM) is used to decompose the carbon emissions of the eight regional power sectors, and the driving factors and their effects on carbon emissions in the power sector of each region are compared. Then, the decoupling index based on the generalized Divisia index model (GDIM-D) is used to study the decoupling relationship between the carbon emissions of the eight regional power sectors and economic growth. Finally, the carbon emissions and decoupling indices of the power sector from 2017 to 2030 are predicted. The results show the following. First, the gross domestic product (GDP) and output scale are the main factors contributing to the carbon emissions of the eight regional power sectors. The carbon intensity of the power sector in GDP (C/G) and output carbon intensity(C/E) are the main factors that contribute to the reduction. Second, the carbon emissions of the southern coast, the middle Yellow River, and the Southwest peaked in 2013 and have been decoupled from economic growth, while those in the other regions have not peaked or decoupled. Third, if the carbon emissions of the power sector in the Northeast, northern coast, eastern coast, middle Yangtze River, and Northwest reach a peak in 2030, they will face many emission reduction pressures. This paper provides a reference for studying the carbon emissions of China’s regional power sectors and their relationship with economic growth and has important implications for peak carbon emissions at the national level. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emission peak; China; Economic decoupling; Factor decomposition; Power sector; Predictive assessment","assessment method; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; economic growth; emission control; feasibility study; Gross Domestic Product; index method; prediction; China; Yangtze River; Yellow River; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; energy resource; feasibility study; greenhouse gas; gross national product; theoretical model; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Energy-Generating Resources; Feasibility Studies; Greenhouse Gases; Gross Domestic Product; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070281390

At the same time, energy hub is the key to coupling different energy networks. Therefore, from the optimization of the output of the energy hub to the optimization of the coordinated operation state of the multi-energy network is the core of the regional integrated energy system operation optimization research. This paper focuses on the operation optimization of regional integrated energy systems based on modeling of Electricity-Thermal-Natural Gas Network. Firstly, a general model of Electricity network, Natural Gas network, and Thermal network is established, on this basis, according to the coupling mechanism of multi-energy network, a comprehensive model of Electricity-Thermal-Natural Gas coupling system is established. Secondly, considering the constraints such as energy balance and transmission power of external network, an economic dispatching model of regional integrated energy system considering ladder carbon trading mechanism is established with the objective of minimizing economic cost. Thirdly, Fruit Fly Optimization Algorithm is used to solve the economic dispatch model, and the optimization results of the energy hub are obtained. Combined with the general energy network model, the optimization results of each energy network are further obtained according to the characteristics of energy balance and energy flow transmission of the system, including equipment output, gas turbine efficiency, thermal medium velocity, etc. Finally, in order to illustrate the advantages of this method, “Following power load”, “Following heat load”, and “Optimal scheduling” are set up in the simulation, and the simulation results show that the total operation cost of “Optimal scheduling” mode is reduced by 8.44% and the environmental emission is reduced by 15.03% compared with the other two modes, and the technical and economic characteristics of “Optimal scheduling” mode have strong advantages in the three modes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon trading; Economic cost; Energy hub; Energy network; Operation optimization; Regional integrated energy system","Costs; Electric power system interconnection; Emission control; Energy balance; Gases; Natural gas; Scheduling; Vehicle transmissions; Carbon trading; Economic costs; Energy hubs; Energy networks; Integrated energy systems; Operation optimization; Electric load dispatching; cost; electricity; emissions trading; energy; energy balance; energy flow; integrated approach; modeling; natural gas; optimization; thermal power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067244964

The results of the conditional logit model provide compelling evidence that environmental regulations do affect the location choice of firms in polluting industries. Instead of supporting the pollution haven effect, our results consistently confirm the Porter effect at the country level. This result is robust when taking endogeneity problem into account, adopting various model specifications and estimation strategies, using alternative measurements of environmental regulation and location choices, and subsampling excluding international political events. However, the results also show divergent effect of environmental regulation on location choices for heterogeneous firms. Speciﬁcally, polluting firms in eastern region prefer to invest in provinces with stringent environmental policies but those in other regions, especially in northeastern region, choose to locate in provinces with lax environmental regulation. While water-dependent polluting firms with a low level of footlooseness are more likely to enter locations with loose environmental regulation, air pollution-intensive firms tend to locate in provinces with tight environmental legislation.

In this work, we investigate the decoupling states and driving factors of decoupling states in the transport sector of China’s four municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Chongqing) through combining the Tapio decoupling approach with the decomposition technique. The results show that (i) the decoupling state of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin improved; Beijing stabilized in weak decoupling; Shanghai and Tianjin appeared to have strong decoupling, but the decoupling state of Chongqing deteriorated from decoupling to negative decoupling. (ii) The energy-saving effect was the primary contributor to decoupling in these four municipalities, promoting transport’s economic growth strongly decouple from carbon emission. The economic scale effect was not optimized enough in Chongqing, facilitating expansive coupling, and expansive negative decoupling emerged. But it had a rather positive impact on decoupling process in Beijing, Shanghai and Tianjin, promoting economic growth to weakly decouple from carbon emission. (iii) The carbon-reduction effect promoted strong decoupling, which emerged in Shanghai’s transport sector, more so than in the other three municipalities, in which weak decoupling emerged. Finally, several relevant policy recommendations were offered to promote the decoupling of carbon emission from economic growth and low-carbon transport. © 2019 by the authors.

Climate change and its impacts on agriculture, especially grain production, is one of the major challenges for food security and sustainable development. From the perspective of natural flow, climate change directly affects plant growth via water circulation, such as droughts and floods. Although the covariation of surface temperature and CO2 concentration will to some extent benefit crop photosynthesis, grain production may fluctuate according to the grain market, which is also affected by its erratic provisioning. We then determine how climate change affects grain production and efficiency using an input distance function and technical inefficiency model. First, we discover a significant relationship between surface temperature and grain production, although this impact is marginal; the coefficient is 0.0037 in the estimated model. Second, we find that surface temperature influences grain production not only through its photosynthesis but also its production efficiency in major grain production areas. And grain production efficiency is in a decreasing trend from 2000 to 2010, the average efficiency in 2010 is 0.75 on the whole.

In this study, we determined the spatial pattern of soil C density of grasslands in Southern China as well as its underlying driving forces based on 317 field-sampled grasslands throughout Southern China. Our results indicated that soil C density in grass-forb meadows (GM) was significantly higher than that of temperate grasslands (TG) and subtropical grasslands (SG), mainly due to its lower organic matter decomposition rate. Moreover, we found that the main controls over soil C density shifted among different grassland types, with climate factors (mean annual air temperature and precipitation) being the main regulators in TG and SG, but vegetation condition was more important for meadows. This implied that soil C in TG and SG was more sensitive to climate change than C stored in GM. We estimated the total soil C stock to 100 cm depth of all grasslands in Southern China as 2.12–2.32 Pg C, accounting for ˜6-14% of soil C storage in China, conﬁrming the importance of grasslands in Southern China in land C budget in monsoon-inﬂuenced regions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate regulation; Regional estimation; Shifting controls; Soil carbon; Spatial pattern","carbon sequestration; climate change; estimation method; grassland soil; meadow; soil carbon; soil organic matter; spatial analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067883787

Some problems within the market include insufficient incentives, inefficient emissions reduction, and inequitable distribution. While previous studies adopted a state or provincial level perspective to examine such issues, little research has focused on enterprises at a business level. This article proposes a new incentive model that aims to resolve these problems. This model was developed while considering the carbon emission intensity of enterprises and cooperative game theory. According to the advanced value and average value of carbon emission intensity, the model classifies enterprises into three regions. The quota in the second year is related to its own emission intensity and the number of enterprises located in the region, which not only stimulates the enthusiasm of the enterprise to reduce emissions, but also serves to encourage more enterprises to participate in emission reductions. This article presents a study of 16 textile enterprises in Shandong Province. Depending on the model's calculation, the quota can be redistributed. Different emission intensity brings different emission reduction costs, which can intuitively show different responsibilities. The result is fairer and more reasonable than distributions that are based on a historical emissions quota. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission intensity; Cooperative game; Emission reduction cost; Incentive model","Carbon; Commerce; Cost reduction; Emission control; Carbon emission intensities; Cooperative game; Cooperative game theory; Emission intensity; Emission reduction; Emissions reduction; Historical emissions; Incentive models; Game theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068668446

A reliable warning system can provide valuable information to protect mankind from the effects of pollution and can act as a tool that allows regulators to implement corresponding measures to reduce air pollution. However, the previous most valuable research studies were focused on pollution forecasting and the extent to which pollution affects health, and the aim of only a few studies was to analyze pollution from an application perspective and to construct a reasonable early warning system. In this study, an air pollution early warning system was constructed, which comprises two modules: an air pollution forecasting module and an air quality evaluation module. In the forecasting module, two denoising methods and a multi-objective optimization algorithm are integrated into a novel hybrid forecasting model. In the evaluation module, fuzzy synthetic evaluation is used to evaluate air quality objectively. To verify the performance of the proposed early warning system, hourly pollutants concentration data were used in a case study of three metropolises in China and three numeric simulation experiments were conducted. The simulation results show that the forecasting performance of the L2,1RF-ELM model used in this study is better than the traditional neural network, and the forecasting model proposed in this paper is better than the traditional statistical model ARIMA.

Hebei Province is a high haze area and one of the key areas of China’s “Blue Sky Defense” policy. As carbon emission is one of the most important factors causing haze, it is necessary to screen the influencing factors effectively to make quantitative analysis and predict carbon emissions in different degrees of coordination. Faced with the new situation of Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei coordinated development and more environmental constraints, this paper designs a system for predicting carbon emissions in Hebei Province innovatively using the data during 1990–2016. In the first step, 7 influence factors are determined by “graded screening.” Then, this paper improved the traditional support vector machine (SVM) by improved gray wolf optimizer (IGWO), and established IGWO-SVM model. Finally, the carbon emissions in Hebei Province from 2017 to 2025 are predicted under three stages of different cooperative development speed of 7 influence factors by the improved intelligent algorithm model.

Further, it reduces emissions, which is an advantage that is being extensively studied. In SC-CO2 fracturing, fracturing pump injection parameters, physical property changes of fracturing fluid, and the geometry size of fractures influence the temperature–pressure field. Based on an experimental regression, the calculation formula of SC-CO2 friction coefficient in fractures is obtained. Considering the physical characteristics of SC-CO2, the change in internal energy and flow work of fracturing fluid, and filtration and fracture characters, the unsteady temperature–pressure field model of SC-CO2 in wellbores and fractures is established. The model is applicable for any known fracture geometry. For a fixed position in the wellbore, with the increase of fracturing time, the temperature of the fracturing fluid rapidly drops and the pressure gradually increases; for a fixed position in the fracture, the temperature of the fracturing fluid gradually drops and the pressure gradually increases. The temperature difference between the fracturing fluid and the filtration zone gradually decreases from the fracture opening to end. As the fracturing time and fracturing fluid flow rate increases, the rock cooling distance of SC-CO2 fluid increases with fracturing time and flow rate of the fracturing fluid. By incorporating the unsteady temperature–pressure field model in wellbores and fractures with SC-CO2 fracturing, theoretical guidance for the phase state control in SC-CO2 fracturing fractures and the hydraulic parameter design of SC-CO2 fracturing is attained. © 2019","Cooling distance; Fracture; Pressure field; SC-CO2 fracturing; Temperature field","Boreholes; Drops; Economic and social effects; Flow of fluids; Fracture; Fracturing fluids; Friction; Hydraulic fracturing; Oil field equipment; Reservoirs (water); Supercritical fluid extraction; Temperature distribution; Water pollution; Friction coefficients; Hydraulic parameters; Injection parameters; Physical characteristics; Pressure field; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Temperature differences; Unsteady temperatures; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066068182

Converting urban wastes into energy has been recognized as a promising way to achieve circular economy. In this study, combustible waste, food waste, industrial organic wastewater, and breeding-farm manure are considered to be utilized for energy recovery through waste-to-energy (WtE) technologies. Accordingly, four WtE sectors for power generation are formed and introduced into the socioeconomic activities. A methodological framework is established by combining econometrics, physical input-output model and baseline method of clean development mechanism to evaluate the energy and environmental benefits in China's 31 provincial regions during the period 2016–2025. The results reveal that the regions with more waste generation and power generation are Guangdong (11.82 billion kWh in 2025) and Jiangsu (11.43 billion kWh in 2025). Hebei has the largest accumulative mitigation potentials for the emissions of greenhouse gases, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and soot and dust (577.57 Mt carbon dioxide equivalent, 1.79 Mt, 0.89 Mt and 16.22 Mt, respectively), followed by Guangdong and Zhejiang. Less developed regions in northwestern China such as Gansu, Qinghai and Ningxia have less energy recovery and mitigation potentials. Meanwhile, the changes in industrial structure contribute to more mitigations in the sectors of power and heat, coal mining, and oil and gas extraction. The quantification of the energy and environmental benefits and revelation of the features and disparities of waste utilization for energy recovery across regions can provide insights and managerial implications for better policy-making regarding regional waste management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental benefits; Physical input-output model; Power generation; Waste; Waste-to-Energy","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Emission control; Energy conversion; Energy policy; Energy security; Fertilizers; Food waste; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Oils and fats; Power generation; Recovery; Statistics; Sulfur dioxide; Waste treatment; Wastes; Clean Development Mechanism; Environmental benefits; Managerial implications; Methodological frameworks; Physical Input-Output models; Regional waste management; Waste to energy; Waste to energy technologies; Coal industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070232597

Exploring the driving forces of urban CO2 emissions is necessary to gain a better understanding of the spatial patterns, processes, and mechanisms of environmental problems. Thus, the purpose of this study was to quantify the driving forces of urban CO2 emissions from 2000 to 2015 in China, including explicit consideration of a comparative analysis between national and urban agglomeration levels. Urban CO2 emissions with a 1-km spatial resolution were extracted for built-up areas based on the anthropogenic carbon dioxide (ODIAC) fossil fuel emission dataset. Six factors, namely precipitation, slope, temperature, population density, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and gross domestic product (GDP), were selected to investigate the driving forces of urban CO2 emissions in China. Then, a probit model was applied to examine the effects of potential factors on urban CO2 emissions. The results revealed that the population, GDP, and NDVI were all positive driving forces, but that temperature and precipitation had negative effects on urban CO2 emissions at the national level. In the middle and south Liaoning urban agglomeration (MSL), the slope, population density, NDVI, and GDP were significant influencing factors. In the Pearl River Delta urban agglomeration (PRD), six factors had significant impacts on urban CO2 emissions, all of which were positive except for slope, which was a negative factor. Due to China’s hierarchical administrative levels, the model results suggest that regardless of which level is adopted, the impacts of the driving factors on urban CO2 emissions are quite different at the national compared to the urban agglomeration level. The degrees of influence of most factors at the national level were lower than those of factors at the urban agglomeration level.

An afforestation experiment with different tree species (Pinus massoniana, Erythrophleum fordii [N-fixing species], and mixed P. massoniana and E. fordii) was conducted in clear-cut sites of P. massoniana-planted forests in a subtropical region. Topsoil organic C quality and microbial diversity were assessed after eight years of afforestation. Referring to the species diversity index in the community, Pielou's evenness index was used for estimating the evenness of distribution of various organic C compositions in the total organic C of soil, litter, and fine roots. The proportions of alkyl C and carbonyl C in SOC, as well as the alkyl C/O-alkyl C (A/O-A) ratios and the distributed evenness of the four main SOC chemical compositions were higher in the monospecific E. fordii and mixed-species-planted forests than in the monospecific P. massoniana-planted forest. Positive relationships of the A/O-A ratio and the evenness of distribution of various SOC chemical compositions in the litter as well as fine root C quality were observed. Microbial biomass C was positively correlated with the labile SOC (O-alkyl C). Multivariate analysis showed that the fine roots had a closer correlation with the chemical composition of SOC than the litter. These results highlight that introducing native N-fixing broadleaf tree species and mixing N-fixing species into conifer forests probably enhances the SOC chemical stability. It also minimizes the risk of C decomposition posed by any one soil organic matter (SOM) constituent having a huge impact during climate change through increasing the proportion of recalcitrant C components and even distribution of various SOM chemical compositions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Litter quality; Organic carbon chemical composition; Planted forests; Soil microbial biomass and diversity; Tree species","Chemical analysis; Chemical stability; Climate change; Decay (organic); Mixing; Multivariant analysis; Nitrogen; Nitrogen fixation; Organic carbon; Reforestation; Soils; Chemical compositions; Litter quality; Planted forests; Soil microbial biomass; Tree species; Population distribution; afforestation; biomass; carbon; climate change; coniferous tree; correlation; diversity index; fine root; litter; plantation forestry; root; soil organic matter; species diversity; Chemical Analysis; Distribution; Fixing; Formulations; Mixing; Nitrogen; Reforestation; Soil; Coniferophyta; Erythrophleum fordii; Pinus massoniana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069693914

With production fragmentation among provinces inside China, domestic value chains (DVCs) have become increasingly important to both economic growth and CO2 emissions of the country. Thus greening domestic value chains is crucial for China to achieve its climate goal. A fundamental question behind this issue is to assess the role of DVCs in China’s emission intensity and quantify the underlying drivers. To this end, a multi-region structural decomposition analysis (MR-SDA) model is proposed in this study. A change in national emission intensity is explained by two divisions of effects, i.e. local effects and DVC effects. From a forward linkage perspective, this study further disentangles the DVC production links and captures its impact on emission intensity. Applying the proposed MR-SDA model to study China’s CO2 emission intensity change in 2002–2012 shows that the DVCs hindered further emission intensity reduction of China during this period. The main determinant was the deteriorated DVC forward linkages in the central and western regions of China.

Since the urban form is directly related to the spatial distribution of urban land use, it is necessary to investigate the relation between carbon emission and different land use categories. In this paper, the city of Eindhoven (230,000 inhabitants) was used as a case study. According to the main road network, the entire city is divided into 6754 irregular patterns. Agglomerative cluster analysis was conducted to classify the patterns into 14 valid land use categories based on their land use function and land cover composition namely: agriculture, transport, retail trade, green space (with 3 sub-categories), residential (with 7 sub-categories), and others. The random forest algorithm was applied to select the significant features and to measure the relation between land use and carbon emission. The results have shown the importance of various landscape metrics on the carbon emission in each land use category. The most significant landscape metric is selected to describe the impact of spatial attributes on carbon emission. The outcomes show the carbon emission distribution of each land use category in the city. The retail trade and residential land use categories contribute a large proportion of carbon emission, terrace houses produce more carbon emission than other residential building categories. The combination of mid-rise buildings and low-rise buildings has a higher probability to produce more carbon emission. The assessment results can provide important support for the low carbon city spatial planning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emission; Eindhoven; Features selection; Hierarchical clustering on principal components; Land use; Landscape metrics","carbon; assessment method; carbon emission; climate change; environmental assessment; global climate; greenhouse gas; land cover; land use change; landscape; principal component analysis; urban area; Article; building; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; cluster analysis; global climate; land use; landscape; morphology; Netherlands; random forest; residential area; urban area; agriculture; city; city planning; Eindhoven; Netherlands; North Brabant; Agriculture; Carbon; Cities; City Planning; Netherlands",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067896189

It is necessary to explore methods to improve the efficiency of energy consumption and minimize carbon emissions that accompany economic development and rapid urbanization. In this paper, we quantitatively measure the total factor carbon emission performance (TFCP) and the carbon emission mitigation potential (CMP) of 39 industrial sectors in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region from 2010 to 2016 by employing a stochastic frontier approach. The results show that the average TFCP value of the 39 industrial sectors in the BTH region was relatively low (0.7733). From 2010 to 2016, the TFCP increased in Beijing, decreased in Tianjin and held steady in Hebei. The entire level of TFCP in Hebei was the greatest, followed by Tianjin and Beijing. The CMP in the BTH region increased slightly during the period 2010–2016. The total CMP of the 39 industrial sectors in the BTH region was 11.03 × 108 t from 2010 to 2016. The industrial sectors were divided into four categories according to the relationship between TFCP and CMP. Belonging to the low TFCP–high CMP quadrant, the Manufacture of Nonmetallic Mineral Products sector and the Production and Distribution of Electric Power and Heat Power sector should attract more attention when formulating carbon reduction policies and related regulations. According to the results, we also present suggestions to strengthen green economic growth and regional sustainable development. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei; Carbon emission mitigation potential; Carbon emission performance; Industrial sector; Stochastic frontier approach","Carbon; Economics; Electric power distribution; Energy utilization; Manufacture; Stochastic systems; Sustainable development; Carbon emissions; Distribution of electric power; Global environmental problems; Industrial sector; Nonmetallic minerals; Regional sustainable development; Stochastic frontier approaches; Tianjin; Industrial emissions; carbon emission; economic growth; emission control; stochasticity; sustainable development; total factor productivity; air pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; China; economic development; electric power plant; energy cost; environmental policy; industrial production; measurement; mining; priority journal; sustainable development; Beijing [China]; China; Hebei; Tianjin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067632153

With the economic development and the desire for a better life, public participation is of central importance to air pollution control. This study investigates public perception and the willingness to pay in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, one of the typical heavy smog polluted areas in China, through a combination of online questionnaire survey and field investigation. A multi-parameter quantitative regression model is employed to explore the drivers of the willingness to participate in air pollution treatment. The results suggest that the willingness to participate is influenced by personal income level and occupation, the awareness of air pollution in daily life, and governmental credibility regarding air pollution prevention, which are quantified by the causal relationships with willingness to pay for addressing air pollution. There are large differences in the public perception of the causes of air pollution, the satisfaction with present air pollution control and the ways to become personally involved in actions for pollution source control. Although the present willingness to pay for air pollution treatment is weak and substantially varies across the region, it would be higher if more satisfactory measures were enacted and practiced. The results sketch the residents’ desired clean air plans and practicable clean production actions.

For the full carbon-isotopic dataset (n = 309), δ13Cp ranges from −20.3‰ to −30.5‰ with a mean of −25.5‰, similar to values for modern C3 land plants. In addition to a secular trend, δ13Cp exhibits both intra- and intergeneric variation. Intrageneric variation is expressed as a small (mean 0.45‰) 13C-enrichment of leaves and spines relative to stems that may reflect differential compound-specific compositions.

The resultant ASTO nanocomposites possess the broad plasmonic resonance absorption for visible light, achieving the obvious visible light photocatalytic CO2 reduction and H2 evolution performance. CO, CH4 and H2 were detected for CO2 reduction, but the photocatalytic system exhibits a high CO selectivity. The A0.5STO achieves the largest CO generation amount of 80.24 μmol·g-1. Moreover, the ASTO nanocomposite also shows an enhanced visible light photocatalytic H2 evolution rate of 264.5 μmol·g-1·h-1. The remarkable photocatalytic reduction performance should belong to the improved visible light absorption capacity benefitted from the localized surface plasmon resonance, and the improved electron extraction and transfer between Ag and STO in ASTO nanocomposite. Admittedly, the abundant reactive electrons over ASTO nanocomposites achieved efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction and H2 evolution performance under visible light.

An unresolved problem with all of these approaches, however, is the instability of the Cu2O caused by its tendency to undergo an irreversible redox disproportionation reaction. Here, we report a way to circumvent this troublesome behaviour of Cu2O by driving the CO2 reduction in the gas-phase via heterogeneous photocatalytic hydrogenation. To this end, Cu2O nanocubes with surfaces comprising mixed oxidation-state copper Cu(0,I,II) sites, oxygen vacancies [O] and hydroxyl OH groups were synthesized. These surfaces enable heterolysis of H2 and adsorption of CO2 under mild conditions; they facilitate the reverse water–gas shift reaction, while rendering the redox disproportionation reaction reversible. This synergism provides Cu2O nanocubes with high photocatalytic activity and stability. © 2019, Crown.",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalytic oxidation; Hydrogenation; Metals; MOS devices; Oxide semiconductors; Photocatalytic activity; Reduction; Adsorption of CO2; Catalytic hydrogenation; Disproportionation reactions; ELectrochemical methods; Gas shift reaction; High photocatalytic activities; Metal oxide semiconductor; Photoelectrochemicals; Copper oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073515960

Vascular plants play a key role regulating wetland CH4 emissions through multiple mechanisms. They often contain aerenchymatous tissues which act as a diffusive pathway for CH4 to travel from the anoxic soil to the atmosphere and for O2 to diffuse into the soil and enable methanotrophy. Plants also exude carbon from their roots which stimulates microbial activity and fuels methanogenesis. This study investigated these mechanisms in a laboratory experiment utilizing rootboxes containing either Carex aquatilis plants, silicone tubes that simulated aerenchymatous gas transfer, or only soil as a control. CH4 emissions were over 50 times greater from planted boxes than from control boxes or simulated plants, indicating that the physical transport pathway of aerenchyma was of little importance when not paired with other effects of plant biology. Plants were exposed to 13CO2 at two time-points and subsequent enrichment of root tissue, rhizosphere soil, and emitted CH4 was used in an isotope mixing model to determine the proportion of plant-derived versus soil-derived carbon supporting methanogenesis. Results showed that carbon exuded by plants was converted to CH4 but also that planted boxes emitted 28 times more soil-derived carbon than the other experimental treatments. At the end of the experiment, emissions of excess soil-derived carbon from planted boxes exceeded the emission of plant-derived carbon. This result signifies that plants and root exudates altered the soil chemical environment, increased microbial metabolism, and/or changed the microbial community such that microbial utilization of soil carbon was increased (e.g. microbial priming) and/or oxidation of soil-derived CH4 was decreased (e.g., by microbial competition for oxygen). © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; Methane; Microbial priming; Root exudates; Wetlands","carbon emission; climate change; exudation; methane; microbial activity; microbial community; rhizosphere; root system; wetland; Carex aquatilis; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074187589

There is a growing literature examining the psychological determinants of various climate adaptation strategies among smallholder farmers but little attention to how psychological factors vary across adaptation decisions and the underlying motivations for these decisions. We assess climate adaptation in terms of five risk management categories outlined by Agrawal (2009). Using a sample of farming households in Kenya (N = 494), we find that while 98% of smallholders believe that various dimensions of climate change pose a significant threat to their livelihood, these beliefs do not necessarily translate into climate actions. Results show that environmental concerns are not salient motivators for or against adaptation strategies, but food insecurity and household expenses are, suggesting a disconnect between climate beliefs and actions. Future research on decision-making related to climate adaptation within semi-arid agroecosystems should consider that while perceptions of climate change are important in shaping climate adaptive actions, they are not necessarily a salient motivator. Climate change is predicted to have significant negative impacts on food security but concerns about food security are what motivate farmers to adopt practices that will prepare them for climate change. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Agriculture; Decision making; Drought; Ecosystems; Food supply; Motivation; Risk assessment; Risk management; Adaptation decisions; Adaptation strategies; Environmental concerns; Food insecurity; Psychological determinants; Psychological factors; Smallholder farmers; Sub-saharan africa; Climate change; agricultural ecosystem; climate change; decision making; drought stress; farmers attitude; farmers knowledge; food security; psychology; semiarid region; smallholder; Kenya; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069452435

With the increased use of plantation practices, it is important to understand the influence that forest plot characteristics have on the likelihood of where these practices are occurring. Depending on the goals of a policy or program, increasing forest planting could be a desirable outcome or something to avoid. This study estimates a spatially explicit logistical regression function to assess the likelihood that forest plots will be planted based on physical, climate, and economic factors. The empirical results are used to project the potential spatial distribution of forest planting, at the intensive and extensive land-use margins, across illustrative future scenarios.

This is limited not only to developing, but also developed nations, with cities in particular struggling to meet air quality limit values to adequately protect human health. Total exposure to air pollution is often disproportionately affected by the relatively short amount of time spent commuting or in the proximity of traffic. In this exploratory work, we conducted measurements of particle number concentrations using a DiscMini by bicycle. Eighteen tracks with accompanying video footage were analyzed and a suite of factors classified and quantified that influence exposure to air pollution. A method was developed to account for variations in the ambient average concentrations per trip that allowed for comparison across all tracks. Large differences in ultra-localized air pollution levels were identified and quantified for factors such as street type, environmental surroundings, and vehicle type. The occurrence of one or more non-passenger car vehicles, including e.g., buses, mopeds, or trucks, result in an increase in particulate concentrations of 30% to 40% relative to the average ambient level. High traffic situations, such as traffic jams or cars waiting at traffic lights, result in increased particulate concentrations (+47% and +35%, respectively). Cycling in residential neighborhoods decreased particulate number concentrations by 17% relative to the ambient average level, and by 22% when cycling through green spaces or parks. Such information is valuable for citizens who may want to reduce their air pollution exposure when moving through a city, but also for policy makers and urban planners who make or influence infrastructure decisions, to be able to reduce exposure and better protect human health, while progress is made to reduce air pollution levels overall. © 2019 The Authors","Air pollution; Exposure; Infrastructure; Particle number concentration; Policy; Urban","Air pollution; Air quality; Automobiles; Motorcycles; Public policy; Street traffic control; Traffic congestion; Air pollution exposures; Average concentration; Exposure; Infrastructure; Number concentration; Particle number concentration; Residential neighborhoods; Urban; Particles (particulate matter); air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); health risk; particulate matter; pollution exposure; traffic emission; urban area; air and air related phenomena; air pollution; ambient air; Article; city planning; controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental planning; environmental policy; highway; human; motor vehicle; particle number concentration; particle size; pollution monitoring; priority journal; traffic; urban area; videorecording; air pollutant; air pollution; city; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067847541

One reason is that carbon taxes can aggravate poverty by increasing prices of basic goods and services such as food, heating and commuting. Meanwhile, cash transfer programmes have been established as some of the most efficient poverty-reducing policies used in developing countries. We quantify how governments could mitigate negative social consequences of carbon taxes by expanding the beneficiary base or the amounts disbursed with existing cash transfer programmes. We focus on Latin America and the Caribbean, a region that has pioneered cash transfer programmes, aspires to contribute to climate mitigation and faces inequality. We find that 30% of carbon revenues could suffice to compensate poor and vulnerable households on average, leaving 70% to fund other political priorities. We also quantify trade-offs for governments choosing who and how much to compensate. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"Developing countries; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Environmental protection; Heating; Taxation; Thermal processing (foods); Carbon taxes; Climate mitigations; Environmental policy; Latin America and the Caribbean; Political priorities; Social consequences; Trade off; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073516263

However, it is unclear which biological features of fungi give rise to this pattern. We tested a longstanding hypothesis that fungal succession depends on the evolutionary history of species, such that different fungal phyla prefer different decay stages. To test this hypothesis, we performed a meta-analysis across studies in 22 different ecosystem types to synthesize fungal decomposer abundances at early, middle and late stages of plant litter decay. Fungal phyla varied in relative abundance throughout decay, with fungi in the Ascomycota reaching highest relative abundance during early stages of decay (P < 0.001) and fungi in the Zygomycota reaching highest relative abundance during late stages of decay (P < 0.001). The best multiple regression model to explain variation in abundance of these fungal phyla during decay included decay stage, as well as plant litter type and climate factors. Most variation in decay-stage preference of fungal taxa was observed at basal taxonomic levels (phylum and class) rather than finer taxonomic levels (e.g. genus). For many finer-scale taxonomic groups and functional groups of fungi, plant litter type and climate factors were better correlates with relative abundance than decay stage per se, suggesting that the patchiness of fungal community composition in space is related to both resource and climate niches of different fungal taxa. Our study indicates that decomposer fungal succession is partially rooted in fungal decomposers' deep evolutionary history, traceable to the divergence among phyla. © 2019 FEMS 2019.","decomposer fungi; evolution; fungal communities; phylogenetic signal; plant litter; succession","community composition; decomposition; divergence; evolution; fungus; hypothesis testing; litterfall; meta-analysis; patchiness; relative abundance; Ascomycota; Fungi; Zygomycota; bioremediation; classification; ecosystem; evolution; fungus; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; mycobiome; phylogeny; plant leaf; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biological Evolution; Ecosystem; Fungi; Mycobiome; Phylogeny; Plant Leaves; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072847616

We used stakeholders' visions of sustainable lifestyles across Europe to build 19 scenarios of sufficiency (net reductions) and 17 of green consumption (shift in consumption patterns). We applied Environmentally Extended Multi-Regional Input-Output analysis to model scenarios by assuming widespread adoption of the proposed lifestyles changes. Finally, we estimated the domestic and foreign implications for land, water, carbon and human toxicity potential. We distinguish the options with most potential from those that are seemingly fruitless or present backfire risks. While our method allows for testing a large number scenarios under a consistent framework, further work is needed to add robustness to the scenarios. However, we do find a range of indicative results that have strong potential to contribute to mitigation efforts. Services: We find that a local and sharing service economy has a maximum reduction potential of 18% of the European carbon footprint (CF). Clothing & Appliances: Sharing and extending lifetimes of clothes and devices could diminish CF by approximately 3%. Transport: Reducing motorized transport by remote work and active travel could mitigate between 9 and 26% of CF. Food: Vegan diets could spare 4% of the land and reduce up to 14% of CF. Bio-economy: Switching to biomaterials and bioenergy tend to reduce carbon and toxic emissions at the risk of increasing water and land use. Housing: Passive housing and decentralized renewable energy reduces carbon emissions up to 5 and 14%, respectively.

They use no fuels and cost, nothing to operate; they reduce air pollution and deforestation. This device works on the principle of converting sun's light energy into heat energy, which is retained for cooking and sterilizing the medical equipment. It reflects the sun light through a parabolic trough which surface is covered with a reflective film and concentrates it on the evacuated tube, which is fitted on the focus point of the parabolic trough. Parabola with a diameter of 600mm and depth 150mm is used to manufacture a parabolic trough. The evacuated tube's inner surface is coated with aluminium, which generates heat inside the hollow region. Aluminium foil is used as a reflecting film to reflect sun light, which has a reflectivity of 90%. So that the heat generation increases inside the evacuated tube.

The objective of this study is to demonstrate how and to what extent the local removal of PM2.5 can lead to reduced exposure for the children and teachers in the naturally ventilated courtyard of the American Embassy School (AES) high school building in Delhi. The study is performed by computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with the 3D steady Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations in combination with the realizable k-ε turbulence model on a very high resolution grid. First, CFD validation is performed using wind-tunnel experiments of the flow pattern in and above a generic single street canyon. Next, the case study is conducted where four commercially available electrostatic precipitation (ESP) units are installed at different positions inside the courtyard and the resulting performance is evaluated. PM2.5 dispersion is modeled with an Eulerian advection-diffusion equation. It is shown that the best ESP positions yield overall volume-averaged PM2.5 concentration reductions up to 34.1% in the courtyard's corridors, demonstrating the proposed mitigation strategy to be effective.

Carbon sequestration is a regulating ecosystem service important for climate regulation. Soils are also home of a large biodiversity whose participation in soil processes is critical for their sustainable use. Evaluating these functions to assess the provision of ecosystem services is an important challenge for which simple and accurate tools and methodologies are requested. In this work, the relationship of the soil macro-fauna with some soil-based ecosystem services was evaluated in three different regions of Colombia, Brazil and Nicaragua with rather contrasted conditions of soils and management options. In each country, we calculated a set of sub-indicators of physical quality, chemical fertility, organic matter accumulation, soil macro aggregation and macro-invertebrate communities abundance and diversity. The combination of these sub indicators in a General Indicator of Soil Quality (GISQ) provided an overall assessment of the quality of the soil and associated ecosystem services. The strong relationship observed between macrofauna indicators and soil physical, chemical and organic matter characteristics makes it a powerful tool for evaluating and monitoring soil quality. © 2019","Biodiversity; Indicators; Morphology; Soil quality","agricultural land; biodiversity; bioindicator; ecosystem service; physicochemical property; soil management; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; soil quality; Brazil; Colombia; Nicaragua; Invertebrata",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072345903

Exploring interactions between stressors is particularly important for understanding plant responses in urban environments where elevated temperatures can be associated with air pollution. Accordingly, 3-year-old spruce seedlings were exposed for 2 weeks to aerial cadmium oxide (CdO) NPs of environmentally relevant size (8–62 nm) and concentration (2 × 105 cm−3). While half the seedlings were initially acclimated to high temperature (35 °C) and vapour pressure deficit (VPD; 2.81 kPa), the second half of the plants were left under non-stressed conditions (20 °C, 0.58 kPa). Atomic absorption spectrometry was used to determine Cd content in needles, while gas and liquid chromatography was used to determine changes in primary and secondary metabolites. Photosynthesis-related processes were explored with gas-exchange and chlorophyll fluorescence systems. Our work supports the hypothesis that atmospheric CdO NPs penetrate into leaves but high temperature and VPD reduce such penetration due to stomatal closure. The hypothesis that atmospheric CdO NPs influences physiological and metabolic processes in plants was also confirmed. This impact strengthens with increasing time of exposure. Finally, we found evidence that plants acclimated to stress conditions have different sensitivity to CdO NPs compared to plants not so acclimated.

Both original and plasma-modified surfaces were studied by FTIR, AFM, XPS and contact angle measurements. It was found that the remote treatment 1) results in increasing PET surface hydrophilicity, but in decreasing contact angles (by ∼ 3 times compared with the original sample); 2) leads to the destruction of ester groups as well as to the formation of new C-O groups; and 3) causes an increase in average surface roughness (from 1.4 nm for untreated PET to 2.2 and 4.4 nm for PET modified by air and argon afterglows, respectively). The set of experimental techniques together with plasma modeling provided the information on plasma emission properties, gas temperature, reduced electric field strength, discharge geometry and densities of plasma active species. Based on these data, the modification mechanism involving UV photons and O atoms was proposed. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Argon; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric pressure; Contact angle; Deposition; Ethylene; Flow of gases; Hydrophilicity; Polyethylene terephthalates; Protective coatings; Surface roughness; Temperature; Atmospheric pressure discharge; Average surface roughness; Discharge geometry; Electric field strength; Experimental techniques; Modification mechanism; Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET); Surface hydrophilicity; Electric discharges",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076229271

In the early stages of the reaction pathway, a selectivity-determining step dictates if the pathway leads to formate (a dead-end) or to CO (and on to multi-carbon products). Therefore, controlling the adsorption of key intermediates, in order to steer the reaction pathway as desired, is critical for selective CO2 electroreduction. Alloying copper is a strategy in which the composition and electronic properties of the alloy surface can be finely tuned to alter the reaction intermediate adsorption behavior. Herein, through in situ Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we investigate a composition-dependent selectivity toward CO and formate during CO2 electroreduction on a range of Cu-Sn alloy catalysts. We find that the selectivity shifts from CO to formate generation as the Sn content in the alloy catalyst increases because of a shift in adsorption preference from the C-bound *COOH intermediate to the O-bound *OCHO intermediate. Theoretical DFT calculation results indicate that this selectivity shift is due to a gradual weakening of *COOH adsorption and strengthening of *OCHO that occurs with increasing Sn content. A combination of theoretical Bader charge analysis and experimental X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the origin of such transformation: upon alloying, charge is redistributed from Sn to Cu, which creates regions of localized positive charge on the Sn sites. Therefore, with increasing tin content, these localized positive sites hinder the nucleophilic attack of the CO2 carbon, making *COOH adsorption (and the CO pathway) less favorable. © 2019 American Chemical Society.","carbon dioxide reduction; copper alloys; density functional theory; Raman spectroscopy; selectivity control","Adsorption; Alloying; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Density functional theory; Electrolytic reduction; Electronic properties; Pollution control; Raman spectroscopy; Reaction intermediates; Tin alloys; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Adsorption behavior; Carbon dioxide reduction; Charge redistribution; Electro reduction; In-situ Raman spectroscopy; Nucleophilic attack; Reaction pathways; Selectivity control; Copper alloys",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073265260

India, having the potential terrestrial ecosystem dynamics to absorb the atmospheric carbon dioxide to some extent, is one of the least-explored regions in terms of carbon monitoring studies. The current study evaluates the applicability of a newly developed, quantum yield–based, remote sensing data–driven diagnostic model called the Southampton Carbon Flux (SCARF). This model was used to estimate the annual and seasonal variability of the terrestrial GPP over the Indian region with a spatial resolution of 1 km during 2008. This modified version of the conventional production efficiency model successfully predicted GPP using meteorological variables (PAR, air temperature and dew point temperature), the fraction of photosynthetically active radiation and quantum yield of C3 and C4 plants as the key input parameters. The annual GPP values were in the range from 0 to 4147.55 g C m−2 year−1, with a mean value of 1507.32 g C m−2 year−1. The maximum and minimum GPP were during the summer monsoon and pre-monsoon, respectively. The seasonal and annual distributions of GPP over the study area obtained using the SCARF model, and the MODIS GPP product (MOD17A2H) were similar. However, MODIS was found to underestimate the GPP in all regions and an overestimation in eastern Himalaya region. The study reveals that environmental scalars, specifically water stress, are the pivotal controlling variables responsible for the variation of GPP in India. The estimates of the GPP in different regions of the study area were made using SCARF, and an eddy covariance technique was similar. The SCARF model can be used to estimate GPP on a global scale. SCARF appears to be a better model in terms of the simplicity of the algorithm, performance and resolution. Thus, it may give higher accuracy in carbon monitoring studies. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","C3 & C4 photosynthetic pathways; Photosynthetically active radiation; Quantum yield; Vapour pressure deficit","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Forestry; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Quantum yield; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Eddy covariance technique; Fraction of photosynthetically active radiations; Gross primary productivity; Meteorological variables; Photosynthetic pathways; Photosynthetically active radiation; Vapour pressure deficits; Atmospheric temperature; carbon; carbon; carbon dioxide; algorithm; annual variation; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; MODIS; photosynthetically active radiation; primary production; remote sensing; seasonal variation; spatial resolution; terrestrial ecosystem; vapor pressure; air temperature; algorithm; Article; C3 plant; C4 plant; climate change; environmental temperature; gross primary productivity; India; mathematical model; measurement accuracy; monsoon climate; photosynthetically active radiation; quantum yield; remote sensing; seasonal variation; water stress; atmosphere; carbon cycle; chemistry; crop production; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; photosynthesis; physiology; plant; procedures; season; temperature; India; Atmosphere; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Crop Production; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; India; Photosynthesis; Plants; Remote Sensing Technology; Seasons; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072169866

Ambient temperatures have been associated with an increased risk of occupational injuries but it is unknown how the relationship can vary by weather, location and climate. Objectives: To examine the relationship between ambient temperatures and work-related injury and illness compensation claims in three Australian cities: Melbourne and Perth (temperate climate) and Brisbane (subtropical climate) in order to determine how hot and cold weather influences the risk of occupational injury in Australia. Methods: Workers' compensation claims from each city for the period 2005 to 2016 were merged with local daily weather data. A time-stratified case-crossover design combined with a distributed lag non-linear model was used to quantify the impacts of daily maximum temperature (Tmax) on the risk of work-related injuries and illnesses. Results: Compared to the median maximum temperature (Tmax), extremely hot temperatures (99th percentile) were associated with a 14% (95%CI: 3–25%) increase in total workers' compensation claims in Melbourne, but there were no observed effects in Brisbane or Perth, with the exception of traumatic injuries that increased by 17% (95%CI: 3–35%) during extreme heat in Perth. For extremely low temperatures (1st percentile), there was a protective effect in Brisbane (RR 0.89; 95%CI: 0.81–0.98), while no effects were observed in Melbourne or Perth. Conclusion: The relationship between injury and ambient temperature appears to be variable depending on location and climate. In general, work-related injuries and illnesses appear to be more common at higher temperatures than lower temperatures. Adopting adaptation and prevention measures could reduce the social and economic burden of injury, and formulating effective measures for dealing with high temperatures should be prioritised given the predicted increase in the frequency and intensity of hot weather. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Attributable risk; Case-crossover design; Distributed lag non-linear model; Injuries; Occupational Health; Temperature","Diseases; Health risks; Industrial hygiene; Nonlinear systems; Temperature; Attributable risks; Case-crossover designs; Injuries; Non-linear model; Occupational health; Occupational risks; design; geographical variation; public health; risk assessment; temperature effect; adult; Article; Australia; case study; climate; controlled study; environmental disease; environmental impact; environmental temperature; female; geography; high temperature; human; low temperature; major clinical study; male; occupational accident; occupational hazard; priority journal; risk assessment; risk factor; risk reduction; temperature sensitivity; urban area; weather; workman compensation; city; occupational accident; occupational disease; occupational exposure; temperature; workplace; Australia; Brisbane; Melbourne; Perth [Western Australia]; Queensland; Victoria [Australia]; Western Australia; Australia; Cities; Humans; Occupational Diseases; Occupational Exposure; Occupational Injuries; Temperature; Workplace",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067341073

We present the first pre-Holocene lake sediments from Arctic Svalbard. Radiocarbon dating of terrestrial plant fossils reveals that the investigated catchment was unglaciated and vegetated between 30 and 20 ka B.P. during the global Last Glacial Maximum. The presence of volcanic ash from a contemporaneous Azorean eruption also provides evidence for ice-free conditions. Indicators of sediment compaction and a depositional hiatus suggest subsequent coverage by nonerosive ice until 11 ka B.P. Comparison with regional paleoclimate data indicates that sea ice variability controlled this pattern of ice sheet evolution by modulating moisture supply. Facing rapid regional sea ice losses, our findings have implications for the future response of the Arctic's cryosphere, a major driver of global sea-level rise.

We used a two-trophic model community consisting of the aphid Dysaphis plantaginea feeding on the forb Plantago lanceolata, and a grass competitor Lolium perenne that does not experience herbivory by the aphid. Monocultures and mixtures were exposed to the herbivory treatment and to three relevant simulated environmental changes as prevalent under current climate change (increased temperature, CO2, and increased temperature and CO2) Elevated CO2 reduced the nitrogen content of P. lanceolata, while simultaneous increases of CO2 and temperature modified the plant metabolic component and the magnitude of these responses in different directions. Elevated CO2 enhanced defence systems in P. lanceolata, but these effects were not altered by warming. Interspecific plant competition did, however, neutralize these responses. There were no indirect effects of climate change on aphid population growth despite changes in plant defence, nutritional quality and biomass induced by our environmental change scenarios. We thus demonstrate interactions between abiotic and biotic processes on plant metabolite profiles, but more importantly, that climate change effects on a selection of the metabolic pathways are altered by herbivory and competition. Our experiment under semi-natural conditions thus demonstrates the non-additive and often neutralizing effects of biotic interactions on plant metabolism and species performance under climate-associated environmental change.

Its production has emerged from the need to decarbonize our economy in order to mitigate climate change and to restrain depletion of fossil resources. In this study a literature review on the current status and emerging technologies for second generation bioethanol production from waste has been implemented. Specifically, the examined feedstocks included lignocellulosic streams, industrial food processing waste streams and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste. The study revealed that the sustainable production of second-generation ethanol is highly dependent on the ability to overcome substantial technological barriers. In recent years, major research efforts have focused toward this direction, bringing cellulosic bioethanol through bioconversion and thermochemical pathways to commercial production.

We describe the protocols used for each technique and discuss the positive and negative results, as well as their implications for interpreting the VIL sequence and for dating similar terrestrial records. In spite of the negative results of some techniques, particularly due to the absence of adequate sample material or insufficient analytical precision, the multi-technique strategy employed here is essential to maximize the chances of obtaining robust age models in terrestrial sequences. The final Bayesian age model for VIL sequence includes 16 AMS 14C ages, 9 single-grain quartz OSL ages and 5 previously published polymineral fine-grain IRSL ages, and the accuracy and resolution of the model are improved by incorporating information related to changes in accumulation rate, as revealed by detailed sedimentological analyses. The main paleohydrological and vegetation changes in the sequence are coherent with global Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 6 to 1 transitions since the penultimate Termination, although some regional idiosyncrasies are evident, such as higher moisture variability than expected, an abrupt inception of the last glacial cycle and a resilient response of vegetation in Mediterranean continental Iberia in both Terminations. © 2019","Bayesian age model; Continental sequences; IRSL; Last glacial cycle; Mediterranean; OSL; Radiocarbon","Bayesian analysis; Last Glacial; luminescence dating; marine isotope stage; numerical model; paleohydrology; radiocarbon dating; vegetation dynamics; Mediterranean Region; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070885424

Carbon emissions have been found to be a major catalyst for climate change and the energy sector one of the highest emitters globally. Thus any significant reduction in energy related emissions would have a significant impact on global carbon emissions and consequently global warming. UN-Habitat estimates that approximately 56% of energy produced in most African nations is consumed in buildings. There is a need for energy efficiency and possibly conservation in buildings since they represent the single largest consumer of energy on the continent. Net Zero Energy Buildings (NZEBs), a possible solution for reducing the energy footprint of buildings, represents the evolution of buildings in the near future. The Zero energy concept has a major impact on the design and construction of future buildings. This paper focuses on the review and development of existing Load Match Indicators for zero energy buildings. Four indicators are provided and discussed (i.e. self-consumption, self-production, loss of load probability, and coverage rate indicators). For the purpose of this paper, Predis-MHI (a platform of G2ELab) was used as a case study. Data was collected from the platform's living lab and was used in the calculation and evaluation of these indicators. The results indicate the relevance of each indicator in evaluating the energetic performance of a building and also highlight the practical difficulties faced in evaluating the platform. © 2019 IEEE.","building energy performance; indicators; NZEB; Positive Energy Buildings","Buildings; Carbon; Energy efficiency; Global warming; Historic preservation; Loss of load probability; Smart city; Structural design; African nations; Carbon emissions; Design and construction; Energy sector; Energy-related emissions; Global carbon emission; Net-zero energy buildings; Zero energies; Zero energy buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084639906

By initiating false commands and/or injecting false data into power grid controls, attackers can perturb a variety of system state and dynamics. With a rapidly evolving energy landscape and aggressive carbon reduction goals in many locations [1], distributed energy storage systems are likely to be broadly deployed in the future. Energy storage can be used for balancing power demands and managing increased variability from solar and wind resources, as well as increasingly widespread electric vehicle charging stations. In this paper, we study the impact of attacks on emerging power grids with widespread energy storage. Based on a theoretical analysis and numerical simulations, we find that grids using widespread storage can lead to increased system vulnerabilities if not managed intelligently. Finally, we propose an approach for managing storage such that the overall grid is more resilient to attacks. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Computer crime; Crime; Digital storage; Electric power transmission networks; Energy storage; Network security; Smart power grids; Storage management; Wind power; Balancing power; Carbon reduction; Cyber-attacks; Distributed energy storage systems; Electric vehicle charging; Energy landscape; Solar and winds; System vulnerability; Electric power system control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076403070

As a result of coal exploitation, large amounts of coal enter the natural environment mainly through ventilation systems. Since methane is a greenhouse gas, its emission has a significant impact on global warming. Nevertheless, methane is also a high-energy gas that can be utilized as a very valuable energy resource. These different properties of methane prompted an analysis of both the current and the future states of methane emissions from coal seams, taking into account the possibilities of its use. For this reason, the following article presents the results of the study of methane emissions from Polish hard coal mines between 1993-2018 and their forecast until 2025. In order to predict methane emissions, research methodology was developed based on artificial neural networks and selected statistical methods. The multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network was used to make a prognostic model. The aim of the study was to develop a method to predict methane emissions and determine trends in terms of the amount of methane that may enter the natural environment in the coming years and the amount that can be used as a result of the methane drainage process. The methodology developed with the use of neural networks, the conducted research, and the findings constitute a new approach in the scope of both analysis and prediction of methane emissions from hard coal mines. The results obtained confirm that this methodology works well in mining practice and can also be successfully used in other industries to forecast greenhouse gas and other substance emissions. © 2019 by the authors.

H/C is a major source of energy consumption in residential buildings around the world. Studies revealed that the thermal properties of building materials are converted into the same unit as thermal resistance (R) in the USA, Canada, The UK, Australia, and other countries. However, none of the previous studies have considered the adaptation of national insulation codes to reduce electricity cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with the correlations of energy consumption (Q) to thermal resistances (R) of the building envelop (A). Therefore, this study attempts to review the optimum energy consumption of a selected house due to H/C at different choices of national code standardized R values. Accurate envelop areas (A) of the selected house components are estimated by applying the Autodesk Revit Building Information Model (BIM) to use in the energy model. The case study critically evaluates the variation of electricity cost, GHG emissions, and selection of the optimized thermostat settings for energy savings in different climatic regions and seasons of a year. Different correlations are obtained using risk analysis software on energy consumptions with code recognized arrays of insulations. This sensitivity analysis result shows that the corelation coefficient of energy consumption with medium-low insulated building envelop (r = 0.44) is more significant than improved, maximum, medium-high, and minimum insulations (r = 0.14–0.29) which indicates the insulation range where more emphasis should be put to get an optimized solution. Thus the developed analytical framework supports inclusive decision-making by selecting appropriate kinds of insulation for the design of a sustainable house. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Correlation coefficient; Electricity cost; Energy consumption; Greenhouse gas emissions; Heating-cooling; Thermal resistance","Architectural design; Binary alloys; Codes (symbols); Costs; Decision making; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heat resistance; Heating; Houses; Potassium alloys; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Thermal insulation; Uranium alloys; Building Information Model - BIM; Co-relation coefficients; Correlation coefficient; Electricity costs; Optimized solutions; Residential building; Risk analysis software; Sustainable decision makings; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067357799

Two consistent future emissions pathways are used within the composition-climate model HadGEM3-UKCA: one is a reference pathway of future economic growth and development (REF), whilst the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5) assumes the same development pathway but stabilises anthropogenic radiative forcing at 4.5 W m-2 in 2100. Implementing greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation measures in RCP4.5 reduces global mean air pollutant emissions by up to 30% in the 2050s, in addition to mitigating climate. Annual mean surface concentrations of ozone and PM2.5 decrease by 10%-20% from the combined reductions in emissions and climate change. The number of days exceeding the World Health Organization's (WHO) daily mean air quality standards are reduced by up 47 days for ozone and 15 days for PM2.5 over different world regions. The air quality co-benefits from mitigation measures are mainly achieved from reductions in anthropogenic emissions, although benefits can be offset due to changes in climate. In terms of anthropogenic climate forcing, while the reduction in global mean effective radiative forcing (ERF) in 2050, relative to the 2000s, due to enacting carbon dioxide mitigation measures (-0.43 W m-2) is enhanced by decreases in tropospheric ozone (-0.26 W m-2) and methane (-0.2 W m-2), it is partially offset by a positive aerosol ERF from reductions in aerosols (+0.35 W m-2). This study demonstrates that policies to mitigate climate change have added co-benefits for global and regional air quality on annual to daily timescales. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the GHG policies in reducing anthropogenic climate forcing is enhanced in the near-term by reductions in ozone and methane despite the increased forcing due to reductions in aerosols. © 2019 Crown copyright.

Numerous studies have demonstrated that the presence of trees and urban nature can improve people's mental and physical health, children's attention and test scores, the property values in a neighborhood, and beyond. Trees cool our urban centers. Trees are essential for healthy communities and people. The benefits that trees provide can help cities and countries meet 15 of the 17 internationally supported United Nations Sustainable Development Goals. This critical review provides a comprehensive argument that trees should be considered an important part of the equation by project managers and civic leaders as we collectively work toward reaching these sustainability goals. Summary: We live in an era influenced by humans to the point that the Earth's systems are now altered. In addition, a majority of the world's population live in cities. To meet the needs of people in a changing world, The United Nations General Assembly created the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDG) to improve the quality of life for people. These broad goals outline the greatest challenges of our time. An effective strategy to assist in meeting these goals is to plant and protect trees, especially in cities where the majority of people live. This paper serves as a critical review of the benefits of trees. Trees promote health and social well-being by removing air pollution, reducing stress, encouraging physical activity, and promoting social ties and community. Children with views of trees are more likely to succeed in school. Trees promote a strong economy and can provide numerous resources to the people that need them. While cities are getting hotter, trees can reduce urban temperatures. They provide habitat and food for animals. Finally, trees are valuable green infrastructure to manage stormwater. Money spent on urban forestry has a high return on investment. As we navigate this human-dominated era, we need skilled people who understand the nuances of the built environment and trees as we strategically plan the cities of the future. The overwhelming evidence from the scientific literature suggests that investing in trees is an investment in meeting the UN SDG, and ultimately an investment for a better world. © 2019 The Authors, Plants, People, Planet © New Phytologist Trust","benefits of trees; cities; climate change; ecosystem services; human health; sustainability; United Nations Sustainable Development Goals; urban forest",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106279440

Watershed-wide impacts of climate change under uncertain future scenarios are modeled with the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) for the Connecticut River Watershed of northeastern USA. Changes in watershed flows are quantified for at subbasin scale. The results show that uncertainty in climate change, primarily through variability in precipitation and temperature can lead to spatial and temporal uncertainty in hydrologic processes in the watershed system. In general, the results show that uncertainty in climate can significantly impact the spatial and temporal characteristics in runoff, infiltration, evapotranspiration, and water yield of watershed systems. Strategies to enhance watershed resilience to climatic uncertainty need dynamic information on the vulnerability. Spatial and temporal strategies for adaptation to climatic change conditions could include forest cover and management practices in sensitive locations at local and regional scales. © 2019","Climate change; Hydrology; Spatiotemporal change; SWAT; Uncertainty; Watershed systems","Hydrology; Water supply; Watersheds; Hydrologic uncertainty; Management practices; Soil and water assessment tool; Spatio-temporal changes; SWAT; Temporal characteristics; Temporal uncertainty; Uncertainty; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; hydrological response; hydrology; soil and water assessment tool; spatiotemporal analysis; uncertainty analysis; water flow; watershed; Article; climate change; ecosystem resilience; environmental impact; environmental planning; environmental temperature; evapotranspiration; forest management; hydrology; precipitation; priority journal; river ecosystem; runoff; statistical model; United States; water flow; watershed management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067249074

The delayed timing of urban railway introduction could contribute to a negative spiral of motorization, which could provoke a severe increase in CO2 emissions from transportation sector. In this paper, we attempt to evaluate the timing of urban railway station development based on the level of automobile share and an analysis of the CO2 emissions in the catchment areas of newly introduced urban railway stations in Asian metropolitan areas; Japan, Malaysia and Indonesia. The result quantitatively reveals that the earlier development of the stations in comparison to the progress of motorization tended to result in a statistically significant reduction of CO2 emissions from transportation year-by-year in the catchment areas. In addition, this study demonstrates statistically that urban development harmonized with urban railway systems with a higher service frequency should be a key factor on the strategic realization of low-carbon urban forms along public transportation corridors. © 2018 International Association of Traffic and Safety Sciences","CO2 emissions; East Asia; Transit-oriented development (TOD); Urban railway; Urban sustainability","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Railroad stations; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Runoff; Timing circuits; Urban growth; CO2 emissions; East Asia; Transit oriented development; Urban railway; Urban sustainability; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062030912

Electricity generation in South Africa is heavily dependent on fossil fuels for its energy needs. Hence, it is a necessity to shift to renewable energy sources for electricity production in order to mitigate carbon emissions. This paper discusses the potential for electricity generation through small-scale wind energy conversion (WEC) systems in Port Elizabeth that is considered to be South Africa's windiest city. A wind energy study was conducted through analyses of the local weather data. The study shows that Port Elizabeth has an annual wind power density of 138 W/m2. The area studied has great wind power potential, especially for small-scale wind energy production. The Weibull method has been applied to predict wind power potential in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. Furthermore, the Weibull method was applied to model the probability function of the wind speed due to its user friendliness and flexibility. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Electric power generation; Energy conservation; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Weibull distribution; Wind; Carbon emissions; Electricity generation; Electricity production; Probability functions; Renewable energy source; Small-scale wind energies; User friendliness; Wind power density; Wind power",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076093029

However, this trend has not been uniform across all sectors or regions of the economy. We use integrated assessment models (IAMs) to compute marginal damages for PM2.5-related emissions for each county in the contiguous United States and match location-specific emissions with these marginal damages to compute economy-wide gross external damage (GED) due to premature mortality. We note 4 key findings: First, economy-wide, GED has decreased by more than 20% from 2008 to 2014. Second, while much of the air pollution policies have focused to date on the electricity sector, damages from farms are now larger than those from utilities. Indeed, farms have become the largest contributor to air pollution damages from PM2.5-related emissions. Third, 4 sectors, comprising less than 20% of the national gross domestic product (GDP), are responsible for ∼75% of GED attributable to economic activities. Fourth, uncertainty in GED estimates tends to be high for sectors with predominantly ground-level emissions because these emissions are usually estimated and not measured. These findings suggest that policymakers should target further emissions reductions from such sectors, particularly in transportation and agriculture. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

Different climate change phenomena in recent years have affected resilience of smallholder farmers in Vietnam and ecosystems where they live. The importance of ecosystem services in climate change adaptation was investigated in surveys, focus group discussions, meetings and interviews with key district and commune staff, male and female farmers of Son Tho commune in rural North Central Region of Vietnam. In conjunction with surveys an Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) pilot was conducted in 2016 and 2017 with a group of 26 smallholder households. All survey respondents acknowledged that they depend on ecosystems and services for their livelihoods. Extreme weather events are predicted to increase with climate change. Smallholder farmers and ecosystems were most vulnerable to the effects of droughts and heat waves that limited supplies of clean water and impacted crop harvests, and by storms, whirlwinds and cold spells. The EbA pilot identified that all ecological patches provided direct and indirect benefits through multiple goods and services generated for provision, regulation, supporting and cultural services. The pilot demonstrated that ecosystem services supported smallholder farmers to adapt to extreme events and climate change, in particular, by mitigating the effects of droughts. Management of ecosystem services can provide joint benefits for both climate change mitigation and adaptation, particularly where the spatial distributions of carbon, hydrological services or biodiversity are positively correlated. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Climate change adaptation; Ecosystem services; Ecosystem-based adaptation; Smallholder farmers; Vulnerability assessment","adaptation; biodiversity; climate change; drought; ecosystem service; extreme event; nature-society relations; smallholder; vulnerability; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056145866

NOx, SOx, PM and VOCs (Volatile Organic Compounds) are emitted by ships during manoeuvring in ports at arrival or departure and during hotelling when moored at wharves. Several methods exist to estimate emissions in function of ships’ activity and engine parameters. However, there is still a significant uncertainty in these calculations. This is a severe limitation to develop effective plans of mitigation of air pollution in port cities. In this paper data of NOx and PM10 emitted in port and traffic of passenger and commercial ships have been reviewed and critically analysed. All vessels are lumped into three categories: cruise, passenger ships other than cruise and commercial ships. Emissions have been correlated with traffic data per year: passengers, hours at hotelling and manoeuvring, calls and tons of goods transported. The result is a summary of regression equations that can be used for the estimation of ship emissions in ports based on traffic data. The analysis does not consider emissions of all the ancillary activities that take place at land inside a port like: upload and download of goods, vehicular traffic, manipulation of containers and others. © 2019 The Author(s)","NOx; PM10; Ports; Regression; Ship emissions; Traffic data","Air quality; Nitrogen oxides; Volatile organic compounds; Waterway transportation; PM10; Ports; Regression; Ship emissions; Traffic data; Ships; fuel; nitric oxide; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; air quality; atmospheric pollution; correlation; nitrous oxide; port; regression analysis; traffic emission; uncertainty analysis; volatile organic compound; air quality; carbon footprint; combustion; comparative study; exhaust gas; particulate matter; priority journal; Review; ship; shipping; traffic",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074110372

Neither the Global Financial Crisis nor the impending ecological crisis has significantly impacted its status as a ‘laggard’ country when it comes to implementation of EU legislation and policies in the field of climate change and environment. The reasons suggested for this are similar to those in other EU states where European environmental law has been inadequately implemented: lack of institutional capacity on accession, mismatch between national and supranational regulatory structures, significant veto players, and rapid economic growth. In the field of climate policy, Ireland repeatedly tops lists for worst performance among EU member states, though there has been some success in the field of renewable energy. While Brexit represents a new crisis for both Ireland and the EU, and the UKs departure may well have implications for EU climate policy, we argue that it is unlikely to impact on the approach taken in Ireland.

Here, this coupling is rigorously tested and the absolute lake level curve is compared with a variety of globally distributed climate archives and used to deconvolve the processes controlling regional climate and hydrology. Considering that different archives are based on different sampling resolutions, and hence might have inherently different recording sensitivities, each of the chosen archives was interpolated and then smoothed at varying temporal resolutions. The synthetic curves, ranging between temporal smoothing resolutions between 10 years and 15 kyrs were compared to the similarly processed lake level record over the last 60 kyrs. The best fit to the Dead Sea lake level was found to be with Antarctica temperatures and atmospheric CO2 levels. Greenland temperatures and proximal archives such as the Soreq Cave and the Dead Sea lithological record, all yielded weaker correlations to the lake level curve. An exception to the strong correlation between Levant climate and atmospheric CO2 concentrations, is observed during Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5e, at a time when the Dead Sea watershed was exposed to very weak Mediterranean westerly systems that imposed hyperarid conditions, and a superposition of southern derived systems that delivered short but intense precipitation to the region. At this time, Antarctic temperatures cross a temperature threshold beyond 1 °C above present. It is suggested that this exceptional warming phase induces a reorganization of global and regional climate systems influencing the Levant. These results have two important implications. The first is the understanding that global temperatures and atmospheric CO2 concentrations impose the first order control over Levant climate. The second, is that the Antarctic records can be used as synthetic lake level proxies, extending the absolute lake level curve to ca. 800 ka, compared with its current span of 70 kyrs. Considering the importance of the Dead Sea lake level curve as a regional paleo-climatic-hydrologic recorder, the new synthetic curve provides a prominent proxy of Levant hydro-climate history. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Carbon dioxide; Curve fitting; Hydrology; Lakes; Lithology; Seawater; Water levels; Global temperatures; Intense precipitation; Marine isotope stages; Northern Hemispheres; Recording sensitivity; Sampling resolution; Temperature thresholds; Temporal resolution; Atmospheric temperature; climate cycle; global climate; historical perspective; lake level; lithology; marine isotope stage; paleoclimate; paleohydrology; smoothing; water level; watershed; Arctic; Dead Sea; Greenland; Israel; Jerusalem [Israel]; Levant; Mediterranean Region; Soreq Cave",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070866890

F. Gaertn.) is a major parkland species occurring across Africa from East to West. Its fruits, butter, and further products from shea butter play key roles in the Sustainable Development Goals of poverty eradication, hunger elimination, and gender equity in many African regions. The inter-play of abiotic conditions (e.g. rainfall patterns, drought periods) and biotic interactions (grazing by large herbivores) shape parklands because they influence vital processes like photosynthesis, transpiration and biomass production of common plant species including shea. We measured gas exchange of shea seedlings grown under ambient and elevated atmospheric CO2 (eCO2), with and without competition of the C4 grass Cenchrus pedicellatus, and under different water availabilities in greenhouse chambers. We hypothesized that eCO2 will generally increase seedling growth in shea via increases in photosynthesis. When growing together with C4 grass at low water availability, we expect an improved competitiveness of shea under eCO2, beacuse eCO2 is reported to augment water use efficiency (WUEi) of C3 plants more than C4 plants. Increased CO2 caused a 10% (p &lt; 0.001) increase in maximum light-saturated photosynthesis (Amax), 22% (p &lt; 0.001) increase in WUEi and 13% (p &lt; 0.001) increase in stem mass fraction (SMF) of shea. Grass competition significantly reduced Amax by 9% (p &lt; 0.001), SMF (p &lt; 0.001) by 19%, with a corresponding reduction in all biomass parameters, but also significantly increased the C/N ratio (by 3%, p &lt; 0.001). Interactive effects of eCO2 and competition were recorded for maximum electron transport rate, dark respiration, stomatal conductance, CO2 compensation point and the leaf area ratio. The control of grasses in the early stages of shea development is therefore recommended. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Biomass; CO2; Competition; Photosynthesis; Shea; Water use efficiency","abiotic factor; biotic factor; C4 plant; carbon dioxide; competition (ecology); dicotyledon; drought; gas exchange; grass; growth; photosynthesis; seedling; water use efficiency; Cenchrus; Poaceae; Vitellaria paradoxa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052970684

A system of equations formulated based on earlier experimental data indicating possible emission of cathode material (thorium) into the discharge gap has made it possible to determine the electric field strength, plasma temperature, and concentration of thorium atoms as well as thorium and xenon ions in the plasma. The problem has been solved for a model discharge between planar electrodes. The results indicate the key role of thorium atoms in the cathode region. Thorium atoms determine the ionization balance and other electrokinetic properties of plasma. Emission of thorium atoms reduces the plasma temperature at the cathode, which turns out to be noticeably lower than the plasma temperature near the anode; this is a new result that agrees with experimental data.

Human and experimental studies have shown that diesel exhaust (DE) particles are associated with worsening of allergic asthma. Biodiesel (BD), a cleaner fuel from renewable sources, was introduced in the eighties. Because of the reduction in particulate matter (PM) emissions, BD was expected to cause fewer adverse pulmonary effects. However, only limited data on the effect of BD emissions in asthma are available. Objective: Determine whether BD exhaust exposure in allergic sensitized mice leads to different effects on inflammatory and functional responses compared to DE exposure. Methods: Balb/C mice were orotracheally sensitized with House Dust Mite (HDM) or a saline solution with 3 weekly instillations. From day 9 until day 17 after sensitization, they were exposed daily to filtered air (FA), DE and BD exhaust (concentration: 600 μg/m3 PM2.5). Lung function, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cell counts, cytokine levels (IL-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-17, TNF-α, TSLP) in the BALF, peribronchiolar eosinophils and parenchymal macrophages were measured. Results: HDM-sensitized animals presented increased lung elastance (p = 0.046), IgG1 serum levels (p = 0.029), peribronchiolar eosinophils (p = 0.028), BALF levels of total cells (p = 0.020), eosinophils (p = 0.028), IL-5 levels (p = 0.002) and TSLP levels (p = 0.046) in BALF. DE exposure alone increased lung elastance (p = 0.000) and BALF IL-4 levels (p = 0.045), whereas BD exposure alone increased BALF TSLP levels (p = 0.004). BD exposure did not influence any parameters after HDM challenge, while DE exposed animals presented increased BALF levels of total cells (p = 0.019), lymphocytes (p = 0.000), neutrophils (p = 0.040), macrophages (p = 0.034), BALF IL-4 levels (p = 0.028), and macrophagic inflammation in the lung tissue (p = 0.037), as well as decreased IgG1 (p = 0.046) and IgG2 (p = 0.043) levels when compared to the HDM group. Conclusion: The results indicate more adverse pulmonary effects of DE compared to BD exposure in allergic sensitized animals. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",,"Air quality; Air quality standards; Biodiesel; Biological organs; Diseases; Macrophages; Mammals; Allergic asthma; Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; Diesel exhausts; Different effects; Functional response; Particulate matter emissions; Renewable sources; Saline solutions; Diesel engines; biodiesel; diesel fuel; immunoglobulin G1; interleukin 17; interleukin 2; interleukin 4; interleukin 5; sodium chloride; thymic stromal lymphopoietin; tumor necrosis factor; allergen; biofuel; cytokine; IL17A protein, human; interleukin 17; air quality; allergy; asthma; biofuel; comparative study; diesel; exhaust emission; experimental study; health risk; adult; allergy; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; asthma; bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; cell count; chemical composition; concentration (parameter); controlled study; Dermatophagoides; environmental exposure; eosinophil; exhaust gas; immunoglobulin blood level; inflammation; lung alveolus macrophage; lung function; lung parenchyma; lymphocyte; male; mouse; nonhuman; particulate matter; sensitization; adverse event; analysis; animal; Bagg albino mouse; disease model; exhaust gas; human; immunology; inflammation; lung; neutrophil; toxicity; toxicity testing; Animalia; Mus; Pyroglyphidae; Allergens; Animals; Asthma; Biofuels; Bronchoalveolar Lavage Fluid; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Inflammation; Interleukin-17; Lung; Mice; Mice, Inbred BALB C; Neutrophils; Particulate Matter; Toxicity Tests; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069568526

In naturally aspirated DI diesel engine, combustion process coupled with low pressure mechanical fuel injection systems set different requirements for inlet port performance. In-cylinder swirl needs to be optimized for efficient combustion to meet emission levels and fuel consumption targets. Thus, intake port design optimization process becomes a vital requirement. In the present paper intake port design optimization is carried out for single cylinder naturally aspirated engine using mechanical fuel injection systems. The objective is to investigate in-cylinder flow field developed by intake port designs, study the effects of geometrical details of various port cross sections on flow velocity and pressure fields and establish a relationship with intake port performance parameters i.e. swirl and flow coefficient. CFD analysis is carried out for port performance study at various valve lift positions. The design variants are experimentally validated on steady state test rig using paddle wheel principle. Further, the impact of these new intake port designs on single cylinder diesel engine emissions and performance is evaluated. Engine out emission levels are achieved at a very good margin along with improved fuel consumption. Thus the focus is given to create design guidelines for optimizing intake port performance which in turn required for efficient combustion system development and emission reduction. © 2019 SAE International.

Development of diesel engines for off-highway application for different power segments need different intake port design solutions to optimise in-cylinder flow structure for efficient combustion. With adaptation of low pressure mechanical fuel injection system, intake port development becomes an important stage for reduction of emission formation at the source and improvement in fuel economy. In this paper, intake port design and development process is elaborated for two different power ratings of 75 hp and 120 hp of off-highway engine. 2-valve and 4-valve configurations are deployed for the same cylinder bore size. Considering the legislative emission limits for these two power segments of engines, intake port are designed for target swirl and flow performance within the same constraints of cylinder head bolting pattern and valve train actuation mechanism. Intake port designs are experimentally evaluated on steady state flow test rig using AVL paddle wheel method for swirl and flow coefficient performance.

The Amazon countries still have limited national policies on how to adapt and have failed to cooperate to promote adaptation plans at the regional level. Most studies have focused on adaptation policies at a local or national level, but overlook how these interact with the necessary regional cooperation required in transboundary ecosystems. This article assesses regional and national plans for climate adaptation in Amazonia, asking whether these provide a basis for regional adaptation policies. Have countries addressed climate adaptation in their NDCs and are there any synergies between countries? Are the Amazon countries currently implementing adaptation policies through the regional framework Amazon Cooperation Treaty Organization, and if so how? The analysis is then contrasted with the regional adaptation policies promoted in Central America, a region that faces similar challenges. The analysis finds that regional adaptation governance in the Amazon region is still incipient, and requires a holistic view that integrates a multi-stakeholder approach to climate adaptation. This article makes a vital contribution to the impact and contribution of Amazonia to climate governance, which is still poorly understood. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Amazonia; Climate adaptation; National Adaptation Plan; Regional cooperation","adaptive management; climate change; environmental policy; governance approach; policy implementation; rainforest; strategic approach; Amazonia; Central America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066472465

Plant growth stimulation and alterations of fungal community composition and functions are the main mechanisms driving soil C gains following N deposition in N-limited temperate forests. In N-rich tropical forests, however, N deposition generally has minor effects on plant growth; consequently, C storage in soil may strongly depend on the microbial processes that drive litter and soil organic matter decomposition. Here, we investigated how microbial functions in old-growth tropical forest soil responded to 13 years of N addition at four rates: 0 (Control), 50 (Low-N), 100 (Medium-N), and 150 (High-N) kg N ha−1 year−1. Soil organic carbon (SOC) content increased under High-N, corresponding to a 33% decrease in CO2 efflux, and reductions in relative abundances of bacteria as well as genes responsible for cellulose and chitin degradation. A 113% increase in N2O emission was positively correlated with soil acidification and an increase in the relative abundances of denitrification genes (narG and norB). Soil acidification induced by N addition decreased available P concentrations, and was associated with reductions in the relative abundance of phytase. The decreased relative abundance of bacteria and key functional gene groups for C degradation were related to slower SOC decomposition, indicating the key mechanisms driving SOC accumulation in the tropical forest soil subjected to High-N addition. However, changes in microbial functional groups associated with N and P cycling led to coincidentally large increases in N2O emissions, and exacerbated soil P deficiency. These two factors partially offset the perceived beneficial effects of N addition on SOC storage in tropical forest soils. These findings suggest a potential to incorporate microbial community and functions into Earth system models considering their effects on greenhouse gas emission, biogeochemical processes, and biodiversity of tropical ecosystems. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biogeochemical cycling; C and N turnover; global climate change; microbial functional community; N deposition; tropical forest","biodiversity; carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate change; forest ecosystem; global change; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrogen; tropical forest; carbon; nitrogen; carbon cycle; forest; soil; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Forests; Nitrogen; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070086202

The baseline scenario refers to the traditional way of energy planning and the community energy planning scenario seeks to apply community energy planning within the zone. Energy consumption and CO2 emission are forecast in two scenarios with the driving factors including GDP growth, changes in population size, energy structure adjustment, energy technology progress, and increase of energy efficiency. To improve accuracy of future GDP and population data prediction, an ARIMA (Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model) (1,1,1) model is introduced into GDP prediction and a logistics model is introduced into population prediction. Results show that compared with the baseline scenario, energy consumption levels in the community energy planning scenario are reduced by 140% and CO2 emission levels are reduced by 45%; the short-term and long-term driving factors are analyzed.

However, there has been limited analysis of adaptation planning documents in the region to assess their quality and content. This study assesses adaptation planning documents from Caribbean SIDS, focusing on inclusion of key stages of adaptation planning that were identified from international and regionally specific adaptation guidance instruments. Eighty-nine Caribbean adaptation planning documents—including policies, strategies, programs, and projects—were assessed, revealing that they differ considerably from guidance instruments. Key areas for improvement include the need for (i) more direct linkages between identification of adaptation options and assessments of climate hazards, impacts, vulnerability, and risk; (ii) identification and appraisal of a range of adaptation options; and (iii) increased inclusion and usage of quantitative information about hazards and impacts. Addressing these deficiencies may help to improve the status of adaptation planning in the region and ultimately aid in reducing the high vulnerability of these island nations to the impacts of climate change. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation appraisal; Adaptation planning; Caribbean; Small island developing states",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069704162

By contrast, this study jointly compares the potential impacts of climate change and the effects of mitigation policy on farming systems in the central region of Western Australia’s grainbelt, using the results of several biophysical models integrated into a whole-farm bioeconomic model. In particular, we focus on the potential for interactions between climate impacts and mitigation activities. Results suggest that, in the study area, farm profitability is much more sensitive to changes in climate than to a mitigation policy involving a carbon price on agricultural emissions. Climate change reduces the profitability of agricultural production and, as a result, reduces the opportunity cost of reforesting land for carbon sequestration. Nonetheless, the financial attractiveness of reforestation does not necessarily improve because climate change also reduces tree growth and, therefore, the income from sequestration. Consequently, at least for the study area, climate change has the potential to reduce the amount of abatement obtainable from sequestration – a result potentially relevant to the debate about the desirability of sequestration as a mitigation option. © 2019 Australasian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society Inc.","adaptation; agriculture; climate-change impacts; economics; emissions; interaction; mitigation; sequestration","adaptive management; agricultural emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; environmental economics; environmental policy; farming system; pollution tax; Australia; Western Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071747547

In this systematic literature review, we investigated the geographic, methodological, and conceptual characteristics of case studies in climate change science to evaluate the extent they provide policy recommendations to answer the questions: how can researchers best gather and report policy-relevant information for climate change adaptation, resilience, and/or recovery? What are the current themes within the literature, and how can these areas best advance as policy-relevant fields within climate change science? Findings highlight that policy recommendations were more robust, and significantly more likely, in case studies that employ participatory research methods; and geographic characteristics and use of theoretical frameworks are associated with providing policy recommendations. On the other hand, studies that focus on biophysical parameters of climate change offered weak or no policy recommendations. Thus, we conclude that local-level case study research can serve as validation and calibration data for large-scale models as long as they accurately represent the local values and perceptions of the people in the study area. We elaborate on the opportunities that exist in non-human, biophysical, research for communicating findings to policy-friendly audiences. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Adaptation; Case study research; Climate change; Resilience; Systematic review","Biophysical parameters; Case study research; Climate change adaptation; Geographic characteristics; Participatory research; Policy recommendations; Systematic literature review; Theoretical framework; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100755598

The fields were divided into 2 treatments: 2 fields with a rotation of annual crops (corn, faba bean, spring wheat, rapeseed, barley, spring wheat, corn, soybean, spring wheat, soybean, soybean); while 2 fields had a four-year period with a leguminous perennial crop in the rotation (corn, faba bean, alfalfa/grass, alfalfa/grass, alfalfa/grass, alfalfa/grass, corn, soybean, spring wheat, soybean, soybean). Nitrogen fertilizer was applied according to local practice, and was typically not applied in years when a legume was planted. N2O was emitted from the field in episodes during spring thaw and following nitrogen fertilizer application. Emissions were less during the perennial phase of the comparison (mean 1 kg N ha−1 y−1 from perennial fields; 4.7 kg N ha−1 y−1 from the annual fields; P &lt; 0.001). However, over the 11-year period, the treatments were not different (P = 0.3), averaging 5 kg N ha−1 y−1 because of large emissions of about 20 kg N ha−1 y−1 in the year following termination of the perennial crop. Nitrogen fertilizer application rate explained 69% of the variability in emissions (P &lt; 0.001), with only a marginal advantage including other environmental variables such as soil nitrate exposure or soil ammonium concentrations. The N2O flux data were combined with carbon dioxide flux measurements, fertilizer N manufacturing, and potential product end uses to estimate the net greenhouse gas budget. Net emissions were a source of 1.7 Mg CO2 equivalents ha−1 y−1, driven by 3 Mg CO2 equivalents ha-1 y-1 source from N2O emissions, net carbon exchange of 3 to 5 Mg CO2 equivalents ha-1 y-1 sink, and a consumption source of 6 to 7 Mg CO2 equivalents ha-1 y-1. High inter-annual variability in fluxes resulted in no significant difference (P = 0.87) in overall greenhouse gas emissions between treatments over the full period including N fertilizer inputs and end uses of crop products. © 2019","Annual crops; Crop rotation; Flux gradient; Greenhouse gas; Life cycle analysis; Micrometeorology; Nitrogen; Perennial crops; Prairie","agricultural management; carbon dioxide; crop plant; crop rotation; environmental factor; fertilizer application; flux measurement; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; management practice; micrometeorology; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; prairie; Canada; Manitoba; Brassica napus; Glycine max; Hordeum; Triticum aestivum; Vicia faba; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068028930

First of all, the combustion process and emission performance of diesel engine with internal exhaust re-circulation were studied by genetic algorithm, and the genetic algorithm model was constructed. Then, the genetic algorithm program was written based on Matlab. In addition, taking the NOx emission as the target, and the Soot emission and the output torque of the original machine as constraints, through the joint simulation of Matlab and GT-Power, the EGR parameters and fuel injection parameters of the 10% to 50% load conditions were optimized at the speed of 1500 r/min and 2000 r/min.

A project sustainability assessment framework was structured to support the initiative. First, an on-campus solar photovoltaic (PV) system was designed. The project performance in terms of financial cost and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions was assessed using life cycle cost analysis (LCC) and a life cycle assessment (LCA), respectively. Then, we explored the incorporation of positive social impacts on the local community in the context of natural disaster-prone Japan. Indicators for improving the disaster resilience of the residents were defined based on the Sendai Framework. Our results showed that the proposed solar PV system could provide an electricity self-sufficiency rate of 31% for the campus. Greenhouse gas emissions of 0.0811 kg CO2-eq/kWh would decrease the annual emissions from campus electricity use by 27%. Considering the substituted daytime electricity purchase, a payback period of 12.9 years was achievable. This solar PV system could serve as an emergency power source to 4666-8454 nearby residents and 8532 smart city residents.

This is relevant in natural forests, where conflict can occur between water provision and industrial logging. As a result, conversion of old forests to young, fast-growing stands through logging can dramatically reduce streamflow and water yield. We modelled changes in stream run-off and hence water yield from a forest catchment in response to clearcut logging and compared this with projected climate change (using a Representative Climate Futures [RCFs] approach). We focused on the Thomson Catchment, which is the largest single catchment for the city of Melbourne, south-eastern Australia. Within this catchment, we targeted our analysis at montane ash-type eucalypt forests, as these receive the most rainfall and are subject to clearcutting. We used several forest management scenarios to model changes in water yield over time. For our analysis of projected climate change, we employed a range of RCFs that represent ‘consensus’, ‘wettest’ and ‘driest’ scenarios to model the impacts of multiple Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Our initial spatial analysis revealed that 42% of the ash-type eucalypt forests in the Thomson Catchment have been logged. Under historical and continued logging, stream runoff decreases by 40,211 ML by 2090 compared with a hypothetical baseline if logging had ceased in 1995 and 34,059 ML if logging continues beyond 2019. These losses exceed the projected impacts of climate change under the consensus and wettest scenarios, but the driest scenarios are projected to exceed these losses, consisting of 49,998 ML and 69,474 ML for RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5, respectively. We suggest logging be excluded from the Thomson Catchment because of decreasing stream flows due to climate change and an increasing water demand due to human population growth. This study provides a quantitative approach for highlighting how resource conflicts can be magnified under climate change. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Clearcutting; Climate change; Forest policy; Montane ash forest; Resource conflict; South-eastern Australia; Watersheds","Catchments; Climate models; Forestry; Human resource management; Population statistics; Rivers; Runoff; Stream flow; Watersheds; Clearcutting; Forest policy; Montane ash forest; Resource conflict; South-eastern Australia; Climate change; water; clearcutting; climate change; climate effect; environmental impact assessment; forest resource; forestry policy; future prospect; hydrological response; logging (timber); modeling; montane forest; nature-society relations; water resource; watershed; Article; Australia; catchment; climate; climate change; evapotranspiration; forest; logging; priority journal; runoff; stream (river); Australia; Melbourne; Queensland; Thompson River [Queensland]; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067990203

As part of the objective function, the model incorporated the current provincial emissions mitigation policies, i.e., a carbon tax and a low-carbon fuel standard (LCFS). Based on cost, our model indicates that steam methane reforming (SMR) is the least costly hydrogen production technology even with carbon policies in place.

One of the largest energy consumption through many sectors included supporting facilities is tourism. Bali is the most excellent tourism resort through the precious supporting facility. Modern and comport facility is more attractive now. Electricity supply becomes an issue. It is important to control the uses of excessive energy that emitted carbon and cost. The growth of electricity demands becomes on an exponential scale. In order to keep the sustainability of the environment, the existence of non-tourism industries relate is restrictive. Monitoring and active management energy patterns most effective rather than investing in renewable energy. This paper proposes a method to build community-based initiatives for reducing carbon emissions and saving energy by using nighttime satellite data. This paper consists of detail of procedural to obtain an index of radiance threshold class. The index has three criteria class; ambient, moderate and excessive. The radiance threshold class determined from cross-analysis of nighttime satellite data with light meter surveys through regression analysis. The histogram radiance distribution reveals the profile of the class criteria. The moderate class becomes key to attention. It can be used to reveal any aspect of spatial-temporal dynamical of urban cycle.

This paper presents the design and development of three-port dc-dc buck-boost converter (TPB2C) applicable for EV. The main feature of the proposed converter is its ability to handle diversified energy sources of different voltage and current characteristics with high output gain. The designed single stage converter with reduced components count can be operated in buck, boost, and buck-boost mode with partial bidirectional power flow capability. In addition, the TPB2C converter could provide buck and boost output simultaneously unlike its counterparts which can output either buck or boost output. In buck mode, the suggested topology charges the battery and thereby eliminates a separate battery management system. Roof top photovoltaic panel and battery are the two input sources for the suggested converter. A small-signal model of the converter is developed using state-space approach, and the steady-state performance of the converter is analyzed comprehensively.

Almost all Ag orebodies, Ag-bearing quartz-sulfide veins are strictly controlled by NE-trending faults or brittle fractures and are hosted in the Yanshanian monzonite and quartz diorite. In terms of deposit geology, three mineralization stages are recognized: the pyrite-quartz stage (I), the quartz-Ag-polymetallic sulfide stage (II), and the carbonate-quartz stage (III). The research results of the fluid inclusions in the different stages indicate that the early stage (Stage I) mainly contains three types of fluid inclusions: liquid-rich two-phase (L-type), vapor-rich two-phase (V-type), and CO2 aqueous multi-phase (C-type). The fluid belongs to a medium-high temperature and medium-low salinity H2O-NaCl-CO2 system and has boiling characteristics. The middle stage (Stage II) is mainly characterized by liquid-rich two-phase (L-type) and vapor-rich two-phase (V-type) inclusions, in which the mixing of fluids of different nature leads to the escape of CO2. Only liquid-rich two-phase (L-type) inclusions are distinguished in the late stage (Stage III). The fluids of two later stages belong to the medium-low-temperature and low-salinity H2O-NaCl system. Homogenization temperatures from the early to late stages range from 272.2 to 412.5 °C, 124.1 to 313.3 °C, and 128.6 to 224 °C, respectively. Fluid salinities in the early to late stages range from 1.6 to 12.1, 1.4 to 8.9, and 0.4 to 5.8 wt.% NaCl equivalent, respectively. The gradually decreasing trends of homogenization temperatures and salinities and the reduction in the CO2 content indicate that the release of CO2 and the low-temperature environment are important causes of the precipitation of Ag-bearing minerals. The δ18OH2O values of the ore-bearing quartz veins in the different stages range from -3.7 to +8.1%, and the dD values of fluid inclusions in the quartz range from -113 to -103%, indicating that the initial ore-forming fluid was mainly derived from magma and that the input of meteoric water gradually increased during the mineralization process. The δ34S values (ranging from -11.4% to +1.8%) and Pb isotope compositions (206Pb/204Pb = 18.143-18.189, 207Pb/204Pb = 15.543-15.599, 208Pb/204Pb = 38.062-38.251) of sulfides suggest that the ore-forming materials have mixed mantle and crustal sources. Therefore, we propose that the release of CO2 and the low-temperature environment are important conditions for silver minerals precipitation, and the mixing of fluids of different nature is the dominant mechanism causing precipitation. The Shanmen Ag deposit can be classified as an intrusion-related medium-low temperature hydrothermal vein-type deposit. © 2019 by the authors.

The trunk lines are evenly deployed over the study area with the line spacing to be optimized. Employing the method of continuum approximation, we develop a joint design model to minimize the generalized system cost as a sum of transit patrons' cost, agency cost, and emission cost. The proposed model is applied on two types of trunk systems (i.e., rail and Bus Rapid Transit, BRT) in small- and large-sized city scenarios. The results indicate that: (i) the proposed model saves 31% of the system cost as compared with the uniform-designed feeder system; (ii) large-sized cities (e.g., New York City) prefer faster transit system as the trunk transit mode (i.e., rail), while small-sized cities welcome more economical trunk transit mode (i.e., BRT); and (iii) considering emission cost into the optimization model will lead to 9.43% reduction in actual emission cost. © 2019 IEEE.","Continuum approximation; Emission; Heterogeneous design; Trunk-feeder system","Buses; Feeding; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Light rail transit; Materials handling equipment; Neutron emission; Transit time devices; Bus Rapid Transit; Continuum approximation; Emission costs; Feeder system; Generalized systems; Optimization modeling; Transit systems; Uniform design; Rapid transit",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076805320

Microtopographic variation is a common and functionally important feature of wetlands but is challenging to quantify, constraining estimates of the processes and functions (e.g., habitat diversity, carbon storage) that it regulates. We introduce a novel method of quantifying fine-scale microtopographic structure with Terrestrial Laser Scanning using 10 black ash (Fraxinus nigra) wetlands in northern Minnesota, USA as test cases. Our method reconstructs surface models with fine detail on the order of 1 cm. Our independent validation verifies the surface models capture hummock (local high points) and hollow (local low points) features with high precision (RMSE = 3.67 cm) and low bias (1.26 cm). A sensitivity analysis of surface model resolution showed a doubling of model error between 1 cm and 50 cm resolutions, suggesting high-resolution reconstructions most precisely capture surface variation. We also compared five classification methods at resolutions ranging from 1 cm to 1 m and determined that maximum likelihood classification at 25 cm resolution most accurately (78.7%) identifies hummock and hollow features, but a simple thresholding of surface model elevation and slope was ideal for hummock feature delineation, retaining over 91% of hummock areas. Finally, we test and validate a novel microtopographic delineation method (TopoSeg) that accurately (Bias = 0.2–11.9%, RMSE = 19.6–24.1%) estimates the height, area, volume, and perimeter of individual hummock features. For the first time, we introduce an accurate and automated approach for quantifying fine-scale microtopography through high resolution surface models, feature classification, and feature delineation, enabling geospatial statistics that can explain spatial heterogeneity of habitat structure, soil processes, and carbon storage in wetland systems. © 2019","3D; Algorithm; Automatic; Classification; Hollow; Hummock; Hydrology; Machine learning; Model resolution; Sensitivity; Terrestrial LiDAR","Algorithms; Classification (of information); Climate change; Earth (planet); Ecosystems; Forestry; Hydrology; Land use; Laser applications; Learning systems; Machine learning; Maximum likelihood; Optical radar; Sensitivity analysis; Steel beams and girders; Wetlands; Automatic; Hollow; Hummock; Model resolution; Sensitivity; Terrestrial lidars; Three dimensional computer graphics; algorithm; carbon sequestration; detection method; heterogeneity; hydrology; land use change; laser method; lidar; machine learning; quantitative analysis; sensitivity analysis; three-dimensional modeling; wetland; Minnesota; United States; Fraxinus nigra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069636005

To test this, we run the Community Earth System Model (CESM1) into new quasi-equilibria by altering the solar constant by ± 25 Wm−2 and initialize idealized CO2 climate change experiments from these climate states. The simulations branched off from the warm and control states, with increased and unaltered solar constant, respectively, show similar global mean feedback parameters, effective CO2 radiative forcings (ERF) and ocean heat uptake efficiencies and therefore simulate indiscernibly different amounts of global warming. The experiments starting from the cold climate state behave differently: The CO2 ERF is lower mostly because of rapid adjustments in the clouds, and the climate sensitivity is enhanced, mainly due to a large surface albedo feedback caused by the increased sea ice and snow coverage that extends to lower latitudes. The global heat uptake efficiency is reduced in the cold state. While taking up more heat in the Southern Ocean than the experiments from the warmer states much less heat is taken up by the North Atlantic. The less stabilizing net climate feedback parameter and the decreased ocean heat uptake efficiency dominate over the reduced CO2 ERF, and the simulations initialized from the cold state show ~ 10% more global warming compared to those from the control state. This enhanced warming mainly occurs at higher-latitudes over sea ice and snow-covered areas and the North Atlantic. While the local climate response may depend strongly on the base state, the future global mean temperature increase simulated by CESM1 is remarkably independent on the initial climate state. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Climate sensitivity; Meridional overturning circulation; Ocean heat uptake efficiency; Radiative forcing; State-dependence; Transient climate response","albedo; climate change; global warming; heat flow; heat source; meridional circulation; overturn; radiative forcing; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068177734

For billions of years, stabilizing feedbacks inherent in the cycle have maintained a surface environment that could sustain life. Carbonation/decarbonation reactions are the primary mechanisms for transferring carbon between the solid Earth and the ocean-atmosphere system. These processes can be broadly represented by the reaction: CaSiO3 (wollastonite)+CO2 (gas)CaCO3 (calcite)+SiO2 (quartz). CaSi O3(+ C O2(gas) CaC O3(calcite)+Si O2(quartz). This class of reactions is therefore critical to Earth's past and future habitability. Here, we summarize their significance as part of the Deep Carbon Obsevatory's ""Earth in Five Reactions"" project. In the forward direction, carbonation reactions like the one above describe silicate weathering and carbonate formation on Earth's surface. Recent work aims to resolve the balance between silicate weathering in terrestrial and marine settings both in the modern Earth system and through Earth's history. Rocks may also undergo carbonation reactions at high temperatures in the ultramafic mantle wedge of a subduction zone or during retrograde regional metamorphism. In the reverse direction, the reaction above represents various prograde metamorphic decarbonation processes that can occur in continental collisions, rift zones, subduction zones, and in aureoles around magmatic systems. We summarize the fluxes and uncertainties of major carbonation/decarbonation reactions and review the key feedback mechanisms that are likely to have stabilized atmospheric CO2 levels. Future work on planetary habitability and Earth's past and future climate will rely on an enhanced understanding of the long-term carbon cycle. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.","carbon flux; carbonation; Decarbonation; Earth in Five Reactions: A Deep Carbon Perspective; Urey reaction","Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Quartz; Silicate minerals; Silicon; Weathering; Carbon fluxes; Carbonation reactions; Continental collisions; Decarbonation; Ocean-atmosphere system; Regional metamorphisms; Surface environments; Urey reaction; Earth atmosphere; calcite; carbon cycle; carbon flux; chemical weathering; climate variation; feedback mechanism; future prospect; quartz; reaction kinetics; solid Earth; wollastonite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073204776

The paper describes a tested and implemented long-term biomonitoring system for airborne heavy metals at a national scale. Moss bags (Hylocomium splendens) were exposed in 142 monitoring stations designated in Romania, and the content of Pb, Cd, Ni and As was quantified using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The results revealed that the accumulation of heavy metals exceeded the established thresholds, marking high pollution levels in 8.8% of samples for As, in 5.63% samples for Cd, in 3.17% samples for Pb, and in 0.35% samples for Ni. The maximum heavy metal concentration was 113.77 mg kg−1 dry weight for Pb, 44.93 mg kg−1 dry weight for Ni, 14.68 mg kg−1 dry weight for As, and 3.88 mg kg−1 dry weight for Cd, with several overlaps for at least two metals, thus marking pollution hotspots. In order to process, summarise and communicate the obtained data, a software named BioMonRo has been developed as the core part of a complex monitoring and warning-informative system. The software is able to generate heavy metal pollution maps and specific reports, depicting the levels and patterns of distribution, which can be automatically sent to a number of interested recipients. The results show that the developed national system is functional, cost-effective, and could be successfully used for long-term monitoring of airborne heavy metals. © 2019","Air pollution; Arsenic; Environmental tool; Lead; Moss bag","arsenic; cadmium; heavy metal; lead; nickel; arsenic; atmospheric pollution; biomonitoring; environmental monitoring; environmental quality; inductively coupled plasma method; lead; moss; software; air pollution; air quality; air sampling; Article; bioaccumulation; biological monitoring; chemical analysis; comparative study; concentration (parameter); controlled study; cost effectiveness analysis; data analysis software; dry weight; environmental exposure; environmental health; environmental monitoring; Hylocomium splendens; inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry; moss; quality control; Romania; suburban area; urban area; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; Europe; Romania; Bryophyta; Hylocomium splendens; Air Pollutants; Bryophyta; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Metals, Heavy; Romania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068851971

Multispecies reforestation plantings present a valuable opportunity to investigate BEF relationships in woody systems, especially across large environmental gradients. Location: Reforestation plantings across the arable region of Australia. Time period: 1951–2012. Major taxa studied: Three hundred and sixty-four woody plant species. Methods: We examined relationships between productivity and diversity using inventory data from 977 plots in 386 multispecies reforestation plantings. Diversity was estimated using observed species richness and three functional diversity indices calculated from four functional traits: specific leaf area, wood density, seed mass and maximum attainable height. We modelled how plot-level biomass accumulation (a productivity proxy) correlated with these diversity indices, as well as age since planting, plant density and three environmental variables: solar radiation, moisture availability and soil sand content. These models were fitted across Australia and, separately, within eight groups of plantings with similar environmental conditions. Results: We found no correlation between diversity and productivity, regardless of the diversity metric or spatial scale used (continent-wide or within environment groups). Instead, productivity was best explained by local environmental conditions and plant density. Main conclusions: A positive relationship between diversity and productivity was not evident in planted forests across a wide range of Australian woodland and forest systems, at least in the first few decades of growth. Our findings suggest that the positive relationship between diversity and productivity commonly reported in experimental settings should not be assumed for all systems and conditions. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","Australian woodlands; biodiversity; community-weighted mean; ecological restoration; ecosystem function; functional divergence; functional evenness; functional richness; functional traits","biodiversity; ecosystem management; forest dynamics; forest management; reforestation; restoration ecology; tree planting; woody plant; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068500691

Besides several operational challenges, an appropriate grid integration of battery electric buses (BEBs) is crucial to maintain a safe and stable operation of the distribution grid. Increasing charging powers of up to 600 kW may complicate the situation further. The objective of this study is to evaluate the grid impacts of three different bus charging methods - Every Station Charging, End Station Charging and Overnight Charging - on a typical urban European distribution grid. Therefore, the charging behavior of an electric bus line was modeled with a time resolution of one second and then connected to a large grid simulation. Multiple scenario modifications have been discussed, such as increasing the number of electrified bus lines, taking into account photovoltaics, and charging in the LV grid instead. Results show that the tested grid is capable of integrating BEBs in most situations, while Every Station Charging causes higher simultaneity of charging and larger voltage drops than the other scenarios. Moreover, LV charging shows to be unsuitable for high power charging. To conclude, the results of the simulations offer a solid basis for considerations regarding the electrification of public bus routes. © 2019 IEEE.","electric bus; electric vehicle; EV; grid integration; heavy-duty vehicle","Air quality; Bus terminals; Bus transportation; Electric automobiles; Electric lines; Electric power distribution; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Industrial electronics; Distribution grid; Grid integration; Grid simulations; Impact assessments; Operational challenges; Stable operation; Time resolution; Urban distribution; Charging (batteries)",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084127843

The climate risks are best addressed through increasing adaptive capacity and building resilience. Ever since the global call during the Rio Summit in 1992 for establishing sustainability indicators across sectors, there have been several studies across the world on developing indicators for sustainability, vulnerability and climate resilience. Agriculture, the most vulnerable system to changing climate, depends on the resilience of both social and ecological systems. This paper focuses on integrating the variability of climate into the agricultural sustainability measurement with a broad base of indicators and bringing in the localized factors for representing the agroecosystem specificities. The paper also aims at identifying indicators for measuring climate resilient agriculture in Indian sub-continent and developing a conceptual framework for profiling the spatial resilience across various agro-ecosystems for appropriate location-specific policy interventions. In the current study 1209 indicators used in various research studies were screened, grouped for similarity and purpose and classified based on the various dimensions viz., social, economic, ecological, etc. After a critical review based on their appropriateness as a measurable indicator, extent of overlap, relevance in Indian context and possible data availability, 41 indicators were shortlisted for validation through a comprehensive structured online survey among subject matter specialists (n = 225). The responses from the experts (n = 36) were analysed using weighted sum model (WSM) and analytic hierarchy process (AHP). The study identifies a list of 30 sustainability indicators for climate resilient agriculture in India, that are particularly suitable for different agro-ecosystems of the sub-continent. The authors advocate an action-oriented model called Climate Risk Management Package for Agriculture (CRiMPA) to aid in planning spatial/agro-ecosystem specific interventions, which in turn could strengthen the National Action Plan for Climate Change (NAPCC) of Government of India. © 2018","Climate resilient agriculture; India; Sustainability indicators; Vulnerability","Agriculture; Analytic hierarchy process; Climate models; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Risk management; Sustainable development; Agricultural sustainability; Analytic hierarchy process (ahp); Conceptual frameworks; Government of India; India; Policy intervention; Sustainability indicators; Vulnerability; Climate change; agricultural ecosystem; agroindustry; alternative agriculture; analytical hierarchy process; climate change; conceptual framework; sustainability; vulnerability; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85049346572

Engine emits the carbon monoxide (CO), unburnt hydrocarbon (HC) and smoke density, etc and causing a variety of health and environmental problems at the locations far from their emissions source. These problems include ground level ozone and smog, which are created in the atmosphere. Motor vehicle emissions contributes to air pollution and are a major source in the creation of smog in some large cities. The health risks of air pollution are extremely serious. In general, an exhaust gas is a gas emitted through a combustion process. The exhaust gas is actually a combination of many different gases; N2, CO2, H2O and O2. One of the most dangerous is CO, carbon monoxide. This gas has the potential to kill people and animals if concentrations are high enough. Hydrocarbons come from unburned fuel. NOx are released through the combustion process and have been linked to acid rain and ozone. One of the ways to reduce the emission from the exhaust gas is Exhaust Gas Re-Circulation (EGR), where certain amount of exhaust gas released out from the exhaust manifold is cooled and directed into the inlet manifold. Complete combustion of fuel leads to minimum emissions. A double pipe, counter flow heat exchanger was designed for this purpose. The present work deals with the effect of EGR on performance characteristics like specific fuel consumption, brake thermal efficiency and exhaust gas temperature. The high consumption of diesel fuel not only in agriculture section but also in transport sector compels for the substitution of diesel fuel with suitable alternate fuel. Hence, performance characteristics with diesel and cotton seed oil as fuel in a conventional, unmodified diesel engine with and without EGR are compared in the work. Experiments were conducted on vertical, 4 stroke, single cylinder (with electric generator) diesel engine with various EGR percentages and without EGR. It was observed that, at 15% EGR with diesel as fuel, engine performance improved and there is very minute effect of varying EGR percentage of cotton seed oil though the performance is relatively good. © TJPRC Pvt.

Electric vehicles will be one of the key factors to mitigate GHG emissions due to their higher efficiency in contrast to internal combustion engine vehicles. On the other hand, uncoordinated charging will put more strain on electrical distribution grids and possible congestions in the grid become more likely. In this paper, we analyze the impact of uncoordinated charging, as well as optimization-based coordination strategies on the voltage stability and phase unbalances of a representative European semi-urban low voltage grid. Therefore, we model the low voltage grid as a three-phase system and take realistic arrival and departure times of the electric vehicle fleet into account. Subsequently, we compare different coordinated charging strategies with regard to their optimization objectives, e.g., cost reduction or GHG emissions reduction. Results show that possible congestion problems can be solved by coordinated charging. Additionally, depending on the objective, the costs can be reduced by more than 50% and the GHG emissions by around 40%. © 2019 by the authors.","Coordinated charging; Electric vehicles; Grid integration; Grid model; Optimization","Cost reduction; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Fleet operations; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Optimization; Traffic congestion; Vehicle-to-grid; Vehicles; Voltage distribution measurement; Coordinated charging; Coordination strategy; Electrical distribution; Grid integration; Grid model; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Low-voltage distributions; Transportation sector; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075552400

Following the recognition of cocoa agroforests as being useful for biodiversity conservation and farmers’ livelihoods, there is a growing discourse on the fact that they may also be useful in climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation. Several companies have expressed their willingness to be “deforestation” certified within the next two decades. In West and Central Africa, cocoa is part of the endeavour to contribute to the REDD+ mechanism. Besides producing cocoa beans, the additional expectations from cocoa agroforests (timber, NWFP, biodiversity conservation, carbon storage, etc…) depend on the trees associated with the cocoa plants. The manner in which associated trees are mixed in the system impacts on the cocoa plants and plants associated with cocoa trees within the agroforestry system thus impact on the products and services produced by these farming systems. Studies are being undertaken to identify the exact composition of these associated trees but very few deal with the manner in which these trees are structurally distributed—vertically and horizontally—within the cocoa agroforest. Understanding the way in which cocoa and non-cocoa trees are distributed within the system would be useful with a view to improving the farm system, thus meeting the needs of several stakeholders. The present study reviews the structure of cocoa orchards and agroforests in West and Central Africa (Cameroon, Nigeria, Ghana and Cote d’Ivoire) with a view to improving the products and services of cocoa landscapes. This review is centred around: (i) density of cocoa, (ii) density of associated plants, (iii) basal area or associated plants, (iv) stratification and space between components, and (v) the life cycle of cocoa plantation components. Densities of cocoa and associated plants in the field are not always those advised by extension services. The cocoa varieties play an important role in type and intensity of shade of the cocoa farms. In the context of multiple expectations placed on cocoa plantations, the unproductive cocoa trees in the farmer fields can be substituted by more vigorous ones or replaced by useful associated plants (Timber and NWFP). With the growing desire to reproduce some key attributes of local forests while responding to other economic and social needs associated with cocoa farms, the neighbouring/previous forest climax and its related basal area can be considered as a reasonable aim, when managing the cocoa agroforest. The life cycle of each of the plant components needs to be optimized in these spatial–temporal intensification considerations. In the prospect of vertical intensification, there is a need to give more attention to understorey management and the number of strata of the agroforest. In the context of sustainable management, a well-structured cocoa agroforest system needs to take landscape, local, national and global socio-economic and political issues into consideration. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Cocoa landscape; Ecological services; Forest biodiversity; Non-cocoa associated plants; Structure of cocoa agroforest","agricultural land; agroforestry; basal area; biodiversity; climate change; cocoa; ecological approach; ecosystem service; farming system; life cycle; livelihood; population density; stand structure; Cameroon; Cote d'Ivoire; Ghana; Nigeria; Theobroma cacao",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056672301

However, the existing methods are complex and involve multi-step procedures. In this study, we successfully prepared graphene oxide (GO)/carbon nanotube (CNT) foams with different GO/CNT ratios by integrating GO nanosheets and CNTs in aqueous media of water and ethanol without using any other materials and further treatments. The GO sheets acted as a dispersing agent for CNTs in water by π-π interactions and the CNTs located at sp2 carbon plane of GO which is non-oxidized carbon region provide conductive electron pathway and connect GO sheets. Ethanol molecules added to water inhibit the decrease of mobility of water as the temperature gets lower and prevent the growth of ice crystals. By exploiting the characteristics of the materials and media, it was possible to fabricate macroscopic, stereoscopic, and continuous spongy bone-like GO/CNT hybrid foams in an eco-friendly and straightforward manner. Furthermore, the GO/CNT foam could be reduced by thermal treatment without deformation, resulting in a graphene-based foam capable of energy storage. A supercapacitor consisting of the reduced foam as electrode and GO membrane as separator was fabricated. The resultant supercapacitor was stably operated in different electrolytes and showed distinctive electrochemical behaviors. The inserted CNTs between reduced GO layers and spongy bone-like structure increased the accessible areas of the electrolytes and led to rapid electrolyte ion diffusion, indicating that energy and power characteristics were improved by nano/micro structure mediation. © 2019","Carbon nanotubes; GO/CNT hybrid foam; Graphene oxide; Ice crystal growth inhibition; Nano/micrometric scale structure mediation; Spongy bone-like structure","Carbon nanotubes; Crystal structure; Electrolytes; Ethanol; Foams; Graphene oxide; Hybrid materials; Stereo image processing; Supercapacitor; Conductive electrons; Electrochemical behaviors; Further treatments; Hybrid foams; Ice crystal growth; Multi-step procedures; Power characteristic; Scale structures; Graphene",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065993661

Two different types of soil profiles were sampled: in “conserved” areas, with less anthropogenic influence and in sites with intense agriculture activities since pre-Hispanic times. The three conserved profiles are located in different landscape positions: the Cima profile in the summit, the Ladera profile in the high slope, and the Yotecón in a lower position of the piedemont. The agriculture profiles are La Cruz, La Era and El Llano, situated in the foothill. Properties in both kind of soils are similar, however, in agriculture sites, structure (evaluated in macro and microscale) is weaker, total organic carbon content is smaller and bulk density is higher. Both soils show two main pedogenetic processes: andosolization and carbonate formation. Despite the age of the parent material (36 000 years), the Andosol phase has not been lost. This is because of the geomorphological dynamics of the zone, in which the processes of erosion and colluviation promote soil loss, restarting the pedogenetic clock. The detection of lithological discontinuities (by the Ti/Zr ratio) documents these processes. By the other hand, the formation of pedogenic carbonates is governed by the seasonal conditions of drought. The age of these carbonates places their formation in the mid-Holocene, an epoch for which drier conditions are detected in other sites of the Basin of Mexico. The agricultural land use has also promoted morphological, chemical and physical changes in the soils. The continuous tillage of the sites has prevented the soils from developing. This could have a negative effect on the fertility of those soils currently used to sustain the peri-urban agroecosystems of Mexico City. © The Authors.

To achieve this goal, technologies such as smart alternators and stop-start systems were introduced completely changing the vehicle's power system management and evaluation. For this reason, it is very important to properly design the vehicle electric system to ensure a good energy balance, controlling the battery state of charge to guarantee the car's ignition when the key is turned off. This is done by testing the energy balance of the vehicle, that consists in checking if the alternator is suitable to ensure on-board battery charge and supply energy to all vehicle loads in the most heavy-duty conditions. In this work two different approaches for the simulation of Lundell's alternator are evaluated and compared between each other for later be used in a complete vehicle electric power system simulation. The first one is a quasi-static approach, defined by a set of electrical tests on a alternator test bench. Using the Simulink's Lookup Table tool, it is possible to calculate the alternator output interpolating the experimental results. The second one is based on differential equations employing the classical qd rotor reference frame to model the alternator in transformed coordinates and variables. Those two approaches are used on a vehicle electric power system simulation and then a comparison between each other is made, highlighting their differences. © 2019 IEEE.","Electrical Balance Test; Lundell Alternator Model; Vehicle Electric Power System","Automobile manufacture; Charging (batteries); Differential equations; Electric ignition; Electric power systems; Energy balance; Fuel consumption; Industrial electronics; Secondary batteries; Synchronous generators; Table lookup; Automobile manufacturers; Battery state of charge; Electrical tests; On-board batteries; Power system management; Rotor reference frame; Vehicle electric power system; Vehicle electric systems; Battery management systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084044506

During R/V Meteor cruise 114 the seep sites UNAM (Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México) Ridge, Mictlan Knoll and Tsanyao Yang Knoll (Bay of Campeche, southern Gulf of Mexico) were investigated and sampled for authigenic carbonate deposits containing large amounts of liquid oil and solid asphalt. The δ13C values of individual carbonate phases including: (i) microcrystalline matrix aragonite and calcite; (ii) grey, cryptocrystalline to microcrystalline aragonite; and (iii) clear, fibrous aragonite cement, are between −30‰ and −20‰, agreeing with oil as the primary carbon source. Raman spectra reveal that residual heavy oils from all sites are immature and most likely originate from the same reservoir. Geochemical batch modelling using the software code PHREEQC demonstrates how sulphate-driven oxidation of oil-derived low-molecular to high-molecular weight hydrocarbons affects carbonate saturation state, and shows that the oxidation state of carbon in hydrocarbon compounds and oxidation rates of hydrocarbons control carbonate saturation and precipitation at oil seeps. Phase-specific trace and rare earth element contents of microcrystalline aragonite and calcite, grey cryptocrystalline aragonite and clear aragonite were determined, revealing enrichment in light rare earth elements for grey aragonite. By comparing trace element patterns of carbonates with those of associated oils, it becomes apparent that liquid hydrocarbons constitute an additional source of trace metals to sedimentary pore waters. This work not only demonstrates that the microbial degradation of oil at seeps may result in the precipitation of carbonate minerals, it also elucidates that trace metal inventories of seep carbonates archive diagnostic elemental patterns, which can be assigned to the presence of heavy hydrocarbons in interstitial pore waters. © 2019 The Authors.

The scheme was validated in a set of limited-area model simulations with a 1.5 km grid spacing, in which the orography was degraded by varying amounts. For simulations in which the largest orographic scales are still fairly well represented, the SF scheme was able to reduce the precipitation deficit by 30 to 70%. For simulations where the hills were completely subgrid, the SF scheme was still able to reduce the precipitation deficit by 10 to 30%. As well as increasing the integrated precipitation in global simulations with various grid spacings, some of the precipitation production was shifted from the convection scheme, with its very simple microphysical representation, to the microphysics scheme. In a long-duration climate simulation, the SF scheme enhancements of orographic precipitation perturb the large-scale hydrological cycle, as evidenced by the far-field changes in both microphysical and convective precipitation. Changes over major mountain ranges were similar to those described for the case-studies, so long as the upstream precipitation impinging on the mountains was not reduced by these changes in the global hydrological cycle. Increased atmospheric drying reduces column-integrated resolved cloud water mixing ratios over mountains, reducing a positive bias in the amount of optically thick cloud with low- to mid-level tops compared to ISCCP satellite observations.

Because they explicitly accommodate multiple response variables, MRTs can preserve the relationships between objectives revealed through MOEA-assisted optimization. We generated MRTs for two tradeoff sets that resulted from optimizing the Eldorado Utility planning problem under two climate change scenarios. A single MRT helped identify the subset of core planning decisions that led to preferred performance and demonstrated how decision preferences impacted performance in different objectives.

Few climate-vulnerability assessments explicitly consider intraspecific variation, and those that do typically assume that variability is best explained by genetic affinity. Here, we evaluate how well heterogeneity in responses to climate by a cold-adapted mammal, the American pika (Ochotona princeps), aligns with subdivisions of the geographic range by phylogenetic lineage, physiography, elevation or ecoregion. We find that variability in climate responses is most consistently explained by an ecoregional subdivision paired with background sites selected from a broad spatial extent indicative of long-term (millennial-scale) responses to climate. Our work challenges the common assumption that intraspecific variation in climate responses aligns with genetic affinity. Accounting for the appropriate context and scale of heterogeneity in species’ responses to climate will be critical for informing climate-adaptation management strategies at the local (spatial) extents at which such actions are typically implemented. © 2019, This is a U.S. government work and not under copyright protection in the U.S.; foreign copyright protection may apply.",,"adaptation; climate effect; cold tolerance; ecomorphology; ecophysiology; genetic variation; heterogeneity; intraspecific variation; lagomorph; Mammalia; Ochotona princeps",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074207947

The problem is made more complicated by politics due to the differences between: (1) total and per capita emissions; and (2) present-day and cumulative emissions. Here, we use a game theoretic approach in conjunction with the literature on effort-sharing approaches to study a model of climate negotiations based on empirical emissions data. We introduce a ‘fair equilibrium’ bargaining solution and examine the consequences of the United States’ withdrawal from the Paris Agreement. Our results suggest that the collective goal can still be reached but that this requires additional greenhouse gas emissions cuts from other countries, notably, China and India. Given the history of climate negotiations, it is unclear if these countries will have sufficient political will to accept the additional costs created by the US defection. © The Author(s) 2019.","Climate change mitigation; collective risk social dilemma; effort-sharing approaches; fair equilibrium; Paris Agreement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073960569

However, the future direction and magnitude of the land sink is highly uncertain. We examined how historical and projected changes in climate, land use, and ecosystem disturbances affect the carbon balance of terrestrial ecosystems in California over the period 2001–2100. We modeled 32 unique scenarios, spanning 4 land use and 2 radiative forcing scenarios as simulated by four global climate models. Between 2001 and 2015, carbon storage in California's terrestrial ecosystems declined by −188.4 Tg C, with a mean annual flux ranging from a source of −89.8 Tg C/year to a sink of 60.1 Tg C/year. The large variability in the magnitude of the state's carbon source/sink was primarily attributable to interannual variability in weather and climate, which affected the rate of carbon uptake in vegetation and the rate of ecosystem respiration. Under nearly all future scenarios, carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems was projected to decline, with an average loss of −9.4% (−432.3 Tg C) by the year 2100 from current stocks. However, uncertainty in the magnitude of carbon loss was high, with individual scenario projections ranging from −916.2 to 121.2 Tg C and was largely driven by differences in future climate conditions projected by climate models. Moving from a high to a low radiative forcing scenario reduced net ecosystem carbon loss by 21% and when combined with reductions in land-use change (i.e., moving from a high to a low land-use scenario), net carbon losses were reduced by 55% on average. However, reconciling large uncertainties associated with the effect of increasing atmospheric CO2 is needed to better constrain models used to establish baseline conditions from which ecosystem-based climate mitigation strategies can be evaluated.

In addition to increased growing season temperatures, heat waves are predicted to become more common and severe. High temperatures can inhibit photosynthetic carbon gain of crop plants and thus threaten productivity, the effects of which may interact with other aspects of climate change. Here, we review the current literature assessing temperature effects on photosynthesis in key crops with special attention to field studies using crop canopy heating technology and in combination with other climate variables. We also discuss the biochemical reactions related to carbon fixation that may limit crop photosynthesis under warming temperatures and the current strategies for adaptation. Important progress has been made on several adaptation strategies demonstrating proof-of-concept for translating improved photosynthesis into higher yields. These are now poised to test in important food crops. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","crop photosynthesis; heat wave; Rubisco","agrometeorology; assimilation efficiency; canopy exchange; carbon fixation; crop plant; crop production; enzyme; enzyme activity; global warming; growing season; heat wave; photosynthesis; carbon; carbon dioxide; acclimatization; adaptation; carbon cycle; climate change; crop; drought; heat; metabolism; photosynthesis; temperature; Acclimatization; Adaptation, Physiological; Carbon; Carbon Cycle; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Crops, Agricultural; Droughts; Hot Temperature; Photosynthesis; Temperature",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071401445

In addition, studies were conducted to determine whether the collected dew quantity is significant for practical use and to verify the cooling effect in condenser surface using temperature sensors. Aluminum was chosen as dew collector material due to its high emissivity. Square funnel was chosen as condenser shape due to easiness of the assembly and feasibility of its design. The quantity of the collected water depended on the weather condition. The average collected water was 0.016 ml/day (0.016 mm/m2 /day).

These solutions can elevate their citizens' quality of life by multiple different smart technology management models among end-users, city planners, and technological devices, such as resource management, data management, service management, and network management. There are several works to suggest models for smart technology management, Centralized and Distributed-to-Centralized smart technology management. The Distributed-to-Centralized smart technology management (D2C-STM) model can make several advantages from the combined benefits of distributed (e.g., Fog and cloudlet) and centralized (e.g., Cloud) technologies, such as decreasing network traffics, and enhancing the security levels. In this paper, we propose a comprehensive D2C-STM model for smart cities from small to large city scale. Then, we extend our proposed ICT architecture for the Zero Emission Neighborhoods (ZEN) center. For this purpose, we tailor the idea of D2C-STM model with the ZEN Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and their requirements. Finally, we implement a part of the ZEN ICT architecture.

X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, and photoluminescence measurements were used to characterize the prepared samples. By employing Ce3+ as trivalent ion doped in the LiAl5O8 lattice, the effects of non-stoichiometry of Li+ on the network parameters and luminescence properties were systematically investigated. A non-stoichiometric in LiAl5O8 led to a lattice change and local symmetry distortion. Lattice variation and doping effects, and its relevant defect chemistry had a significant impact on the luminescence properties. The luminescence emission of Ce-doped LiAl5O8 phosphors showed an intensity change with variation of Lithium concentration, which is thought to be related to doping effects and variation of lattice parameters. Therefore, with nonstoichiometric control, the luminescence of Ce-doped LiAl5O8 phosphors can be well regulated and optimized.

Several flood forecasting agencies in South and Southeast Asia, where monsoon floods dominate (e.g. Bangladesh, Pakistan, India, Thailand and Vietnam), are currently using quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF) from numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. Although there are numerous studies reported in the literature to evaluate QPF precipitation performance, there appears to be lack of studies about the impact on the flood forecasting skill. In this study, we demonstrate tangible improvements in flood forecasting based on NWP precipitation forecast using an approach that is operationally feasible in resource-limited settings of many flood agencies. Our improvement is based on a bias correction methodology for enhancing the skill of QPF using observed and QPF climatology. The proposed approach can be applied to any type of QPF dataset such as those dynamically downscaled from regional NWP. We demonstrate clear and consistent improvement in the enhancement of flood forecasting skill at longer lead times of up to 7 days in three river basins of Ganges, Brahmaputra and Mekong by about 50% (reduction in RMSE) or 25% improvement in correlation when compared to the forecasts obtained from uncorrected QPF. Furthermore, our proposed bias correction methodology yields significantly higher skill improvement in flood forecast for global (non-downscaled) QPF than those dynamically downscaled QPFs for the macroscale hydrologic model used for forecasting stream flows. The simplicity of the QPF bias correction methodology along with the numerical efficiency can be of tremendous appeal to operational flood forecasting agencies of the developing world faced with large-scale monsoonal flooding and limited computational resources and time for disaster response. © 2018, © 2018 International Association for Hydro-Environment Engineering and Research.","Brahmaputra and Mekong; flooding forecasting; Ganges; Monsoon; numerical weather prediction; quantitative precipitation forecast","correction; data set; downscaling; flood forecasting; monsoon; precipitation assessment; quantitative analysis; weather forecasting; Brahmaputra River; Ganges River; Mekong River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047950804

These issues have placed electric vehicles (EVs) powered by lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) on the forefront as alternative vehicles. The LIB has noticeable features, including high energy and power density, compared with other accessible electrochemical energy storage systems. However, LIB is exceedingly nonlinear and dynamic; therefore, it generally requires an accurate online state-of-charge (SOC) estimation algorithm for real-time applications. Accurate battery modelling is an essential and primary requirement of online SOC estimation to simulate the dynamics. In this paper, different modelling methods suitable for online SOC estimation are discussed, and four groups of available online SOC estimation approaches are reviewed. After the general survey, the study explores the available Kalman filter (KF) family algorithms suitable for model-based online SOC estimation. The mathematical process and limitations of different KF family algorithms are analysed in depth and discussed. Moreover, challenging steps in the implementation of KF family algorithms in model-based online SOC estimation processes, such as selection of battery model, initial SOC and filter tuning, are elaborated for the efficient development of a battery management system, especially for EV application. The on-going research is propelled by KF-based online SOC estimation approaches distinctly emphasised through reviewing various studies for future research progression. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Battery management system; Battery model; Electric vehicle; Estimation; Kalman filter; Lithium-ion battery; State-of-charge","Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Estimation; Fossil fuels; Ions; Kalman filters; Lithium-ion batteries; Alternative vehicles; Battery modeling; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Electrochemical energy storage; Estimation algorithm; Real-time application; Regulatory agencies; State of charge; Battery management systems",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067867691

The distribution of many native and invasive species has been predicted to change under future climate. We performed species distribution modelling of invasive alien plants (IAPs) to identify hotspots under current and future climate scenarios in Nepal, a country ranked among the most vulnerable countries to biological invasions and climate change in the world. Location: Nepal. Methods: We predicted climatically suitable niches of 24 out of the total 26 reported IAPs in Nepal under current and future climate (2050 for RCP 6.0) using an ensemble of species distribution models. We also conducted hotspot analysis to highlight the geographic hotspots for IAPs in different climatic zones, land cover, ecoregions, physiography and federal states. Results: Under future climate, climatically suitable regions for 75% of IAPs will expand in contrast to a contraction of the climatically suitable regions for the remaining 25% of the IAPs. A high proportion of the modelled suitable niches of IAPs occurred on agricultural lands followed by forests. In aggregation, both extent and intensity (invasion hotspots) of the climatically suitable regions for IAPs will increase in Nepal under future climate scenarios. The invasion hotspots will expand towards the high-elevation mountainous regions. In these regions, land use is rapidly transforming due to the development of infrastructure and expansion of tourism and trade. Main conclusions: Negative impacts on livelihood, biodiversity and ecosystem services, as well as economic loss caused by IAPs in the future, may be amplified if preventive and control measures are not immediately initiated. Therefore, the management of IAPs in Nepal should account for the vulnerability of climate change-induced biological invasions into new areas, primarily in the mountains. © 2019 The Authors.

The proposed framework offers a cost-effective non-structural solution for dynamically controlling stormwater basins through manipulating the outlet gate and providing optimized outflow set-points. An integrated RTC optimization and rule-based approach is designed to mitigate the impact of the discharged runoff on the receiving watercourse, both in terms of quantity and quality. In this approach, the optimization part provides the optimized outflow set-points for the basin to minimize peak flows during the wet periods, while the rule-based part controls the quality of the discharged water, through sedimentation, by increasing the detention time. Various rainfall data series are used as inputs for a case study stormwater basin to verify the performance of the proposed methodology. The efficiency of the stormwater basin in reducing peak flows and improving the quality of outflow was estimated by comparing, respectively, the peak flows and detention times of the integrated RTC strategy with those of a static approach. The results showed an improved quantity and quality control performance for the studied stormwater basin, in comparison to the static control approach, both in current climate conditions with a peak flow reduction from 73 to 95% and detention times varying from 16 to 30 h, and in future climate conditions with an averagely reduction of 76% in peak flows and an average detention time of 19 h. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Control rule; Optimization; Real-time control; Water quality","Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Engineering geology; Optimization; Real time control; Storm sewers; Storms; Water quality; Climate condition; Control performance; Control rules; Decision-making frameworks; Integrated optimization; Rule-based approach; Storm-water managements; Urban stormwater management; Quality control; climate change; control system; decision making; integrated approach; optimization; prediction; real time; water management; water quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070627061

With the temperature rising, the harmful invasive species such as « ecosystem engineer » Mnemiopsis leidyi spread into the seas of Eurasia and continues expanding around the world. Based on field data we defined the ranges of key environmental parameters (SST, SSS and Chl concentration) required for M. leidyi occurrence, reproduction and population growth in Eurasia. First, we evaluated the parameters separately and plotted global climatology of each of them for M. leidyi reproduction conditions. Next, we combined all parameters and determined the areas sufficient for M. leidyi occurrence, reproduction and sterile dispersal. Our results based on climatological data match well with field data on occurrence and reproduction and confirm the areas of its establishment in Eurasian seas. Since this climatological approach was successful, we extended it to the global scale. Results demonstrate the ability of M. leidyi establishment worldwide both at present and in future in the case of global warming prolongation. Model assessments predict accelerated SST rise in the Northern Hemisphere. As a result, waters previously too cold for M. leidyi reproduction could become favorable, which is especially true off the Arctic coasts of Eurasia. These areas in summer and autumn are expected to be much wider and extend closer to the North Pole. It is important to point out that all M. leidyi habitats including native, recipient and prospective ones are situated in shallow coastal areas and inland water bodies (semi-closed and closed seas, bays, lagoons, fjords). Equally important is that the local currents can provide only the relatively short distance of M. leidyi transport while shipping acts as the major vector. © 2019",,"climate change; climatology; coastal zone; environmental conditions; future prospect; global warming; invasive species; invertebrate; Northern Hemisphere; population growth; prediction; range expansion; scenario analysis; species occurrence; Arctic; Eurasia; North Pole; Mnemiopsis leidyi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070716915

Therefore, four different treatments such as CK (only chemical fertilizer), B (only biochar), M (only organic fertilizer), BM (B:M = 1:1) were used in this experiment. The results showed that N2O emissions were decreased in B and BM treatments compare to the control. In contrast, N2O emissions were highest before day 12 but lowest after day 19 in M treatment compare to the control. Application of biochar, organic fertilizer and biochar plus organic fertilizer decreased the nirS and nirK genes copies and enhanced the nosZ gene copies which resulting in the lower N2O fluxes. The ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) amoA and nirK genes copies were significantly increased by organic fertilizer before day 12, leading to high N2O emissions.

In particular, we deployed a single-particle mass spectrometer (LAAPTOF) and an aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) to provide complementary chemical information on aerosol particles smaller than 2.5 μm. For the entire measurement period, the total aerosol particle mass was dominated by sodium salts, contributing on average (36±27)% to the total single particles measured by the LAAPTOF. The total particulate organic compounds, sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium contributed on average (58±12) %, (22±7) %, (10±1) %, and (9±3)% to the total non-refractory particle mass measured by the AMS. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis for the AMS data suggests that the total organic aerosol (OA) consisted of five components, including (9±7)% hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), (16±11)% semivolatile oxygenated OA (SV-OOA), and (75±15)% lowvolatility oxygenated OA (LV-OOA). The regional transport model COSMO-ART was applied for source apportionment and to achieve a better understanding of the impact of complex transport patterns on the field observations. Combining field observations and model simulations, we attributed high particle numbers and SO2 concentrations observed at this rural site to industrial emissions from power plants and a refinery in Karlsruhe. In addition, two characteristic episodes with aerosol particle mass dominated by sodium salts particles comprising (70±24)% of the total single particles and organic compounds accounting for (77±6)% of total non-refractory species, respectively, were investigated in detail. For the first episode, we identified relatively fresh and aged sea salt particles originating from the Atlantic Ocean more than 800 km away. These particles showed markers like m=z 129 C5H7NO+3 , indicating the influence of anthropogenic emissions modifying their composition, e.g. from chloride to nitrate salts during the long-range transport. For a 3 d episode including high organic mass concentrations, model simulations show that on average (74±7)% of the particulate organics at this site were of biogenic origin. Detailed model analysis allowed us to find out that three subsequent peaks of high organic mass concentrations originated from different sources, including local emissions from the city and industrial area of Karlsruhe, regional transport from the city of Stuttgart (∼ 64 km away), and potential local night-time formation and growth. Biogenic (forest) and anthropogenic (urban) emissions were mixed during transport and contributed to the formation of organic particles. In addition, topography, temperature inversion, and stagnant meteorological conditions also played a role in the build-up of higher organic particle mass concentrations. Furthermore, the model was evaluated using field observations and corresponding sensitivity tests. The model results show good agreement with trends and concentrations observed for several trace gases (e.g. O3, NO2, and SO2) and aerosol particle compounds (e.g. ammonium and nitrate). However, the model underestimates the number of particles by an order of magnitude and underestimates the mass of organic particles by a factor of 2.3. The discrepancy was expected for particle number since the model does not include all nucleation processes. The missing organic mass indicates either an underestimated regional background or missing sources and/or mechanisms in the model, like night-time chemistry. This study demonstrates the potential of combining comprehensive field observations with dedicated transport modelling to understand the chemical composition and complex origin of aerosols. © Author(s) 2019.",,"aerosol composition; ammonium; atmospheric transport; mass spectrometry; nitrate; particulate organic matter; rural atmosphere; sulfate; summer; Baden-Wurttemberg; Germany; Karlsruhe; Rhine Valley; Upper Rhine Valley",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074408411

We used satellite observations to quantify the effects of the conversion of open lands (i.e., grassland and cropland) and natural forests to plantation forests and their associated biophysical processes (i.e., albedo and evapotranspiration (ET)) on land surface temperature (LST) in Guangdong Province, China. The hypothetical change (mean 2002–2018 values of LST difference between plantation forests and nearby lands in 2010) using the moving window searching-based method and actual change (changes of afforested area affecting the LST difference from 2000 to 2010) using the spatial pattern change trend method were detected in order to characterize the spatiotemporal variations in surface temperature, related albedo, and ET. The relationships between albedo, ET, and surface temperature change were also determined in combination with interpolated air temperature and precipitation. Results showed that the two methods-based afforestation changes had a similar net cooling effect, but a discrepancy in diurnal, seasonal, and spatial variations occurred. Overall, the actual change of afforested area led to a cooling effect by an average of −0.18 ± 0.02 °C, especially from croplands, which was greater than the air temperature. Individually, afforestation in the mid-subtropical forest zone (north of 24 °N, northern Guangdong) had a warming effect, especially during the transition from natural forests to plantation forests. We also observed an increase in cooling for the tropical forest zone across latitudes. Warming during the dry season was triggered by the albedo from plantation forests, but the albedo-induced forest cover change impacts on LST were quite complex. Meanwhile, ET dominated the cooling during the wet season and warm season. Additionally, enhanced precipitation played a more prominent role in the ET-induced cooling. Evaluation of the effect of temperature change induced by afforestation illustrates the importance of protecting natural forests and avoiding extensive artificial afforestation, especially in northern Guangdong Province, and reverting agricultural land to forest, especially in western Guangdong Province. This analysis also provides a basis for feedback from forest management activities to climate change in southern China. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Albedo; ET; Forest cover change; Plantation forests; Southern China; Temperature","afforestation; agricultural land; air temperature; albedo; climate change; evapotranspiration; forest cover; induced response; land surface; observational method; plantation forestry; satellite altimetry; surface temperature; China; Guangdong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068136884

However, there are few reports available on methane and nitrous oxide emissions from each type of livestock and crop in all counties of the province due to a lack of statistical data of sub-categories, such as the different fertilizer quantities used in each crop in the county. Because fertilizer input is the most significant factor for N2O emissions from agricultural soils, how to best distribute the total fertilizer mass to a crop-specific fertilizer rate for each county is a major challenge in agricultural management. In this study, authors developed a crop-specific method correlating the recommended fertilizer rate and planted area of each crop for a reasonable distribution of total fertilizer mass to fertilizer rate. This is based on a balance between the sum of fertilizer used in all crops and the total fertilizer mass used by each municipality. Using this method, our calculations in 69 municipalities in the province of Alberta, Canada showed that the fertilizer rate for each crop was reasonably distributed from the total fertilizer mass of a municipality: less than 170 kg-N ha−1. The obtained fertilizer rates for each crop in 69 municipalities were used in GHG inventories using IPCC 2006 tier 1 and 2 methods. The total CH4 and N2O emissions from agriculture in all of Alberta in 2011 were 328 Gg CH4 yr−1 and 23.5 Gg N2O yr−1, respectively. The southeastern municipalities generally emitted more CH4 and N2O than northwestern municipalities. The southern municipality of Lethbridge emitted the largest amount of CH4 and N2O of all municipalities (25.3 Gg CH4 yr−1 (7.70% of total CH4 of entire Alberta) and 1.26 Gg N2O yr−1 (5.40% of total N2O of entire Alberta), respectively). This was due to its largest cattle population (414,627 head) and larger synthetic fertilizer input (32,111 ton-N) and planted area (206,077 ha). The second largest CH4 and N2O emission source was also located at the south. The Taber municipality emitted 15.8 Gg CH4 yr−1 (4.80% of total CH4 of entire Alberta) and 1.14 Gg N2O yr−1 (4.80% of total N2O of entire Alberta), respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emissions; Fertilizer distribution; IPCC inventory; Methane; Nitrous oxide","Carbon footprint; Crops; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Agricultural management; Agricultural soils; IPCC inventory; Nitrous oxide; Nitrous oxide emissions; Reducing emissions; Spatially explicit; Synthetic fertilizers; Fertilizers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068054089

In this paper, we discuss the sustainability measures taken for the Suhua Highway Improvement Project. This highway is located in eastern Taiwan, running in a north–south direction and connecting Suao (north end) and Hualien (south end). Project design started in 2008 and associated construction work commenced in 2013 and is expected to be finished in early 2020. It includes eight tunnels (24.5 km), thirteen bridges (8.5 km), and embankments (5.8 km), with a total length of 38.8 km. Some key areas of sustainability, including ecology, landscape, carbon reduction, and cultural preservation, have been taken into consideration in the design and construction phases. In this paper, we will discuss and present detailed study results along with the project construction status. This project is the first highway project in Taiwan that tracks the carbon footprint inventory for each detailed activity. Adjusting the concrete mixture through replacing part of cement with coal fly ash and ground-granulated blast-furnace slag helped reduce roughly 34–43% carbon emission. In addition, comprehensive study on ecological conservation has resulted in some remarkable achievements. The highway design also incorporates local characteristics into the bridge architecture, making it a pleasant addition to the landscape. The sustainability practices and measures taken for the Suhua Highway Improvement project could be very helpful for sustainable environment at local and global levels. © 2019, Iran University of Science and Technology.","Carbon footprint inventory; Cultural preservation; Ecological conservation; Landscape; Suhua highway improvement; Sustainability","Blast furnaces; Bridges; Carbon footprint; Concrete mixtures; Emission control; Fly ash; Highway planning; Slags; Civil engineering projects; Cultural preservation; Ecological conservation; Ground granulated blast furnace slag; Highway improvement projects; Highway improvements; Landscape; Sustainability practices; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069765909

The reverse-flow configuration (air injection from the exit end) allows effective internal product gas recirculation and stabilization of the reaction zone. This apparently suppresses near-stoichiometric reactions and hot spot regions resulting in low pollutant (NOx and CO) emissions in the non-premixed mode. The combustor was tested at thermal intensity variation from 19 to 39 MW/m3 atm with direct injection (DI) of liquid fuel in cross-flow of air injection with two fuel injection diameters of 0.5 mm (D1) and 0.8 mm (D2). The combustion process was found to be stable with NOx emissions of 8 ppm (for D1) and 9 ppm (for D2), the CO emissions were 90 ppm for D1 and 120 ppm for D2, at an equivalence ratio (?) of 0.7. Macroscopic spray properties of the fuel jet in cross-flow were investigated using high-speed imaging techniques in unconfined and nonreacting conditions. It was found that the fuel jet in smaller fuel injection diameter (D1) case penetrated farther than that in D2 case due to higher fuel injection momentum, thus possibly resulting in a finer spray and better fuel-oxidizer mixing, and in turn leading to lower CO and NOx emissions in the D1 case as compared with the D2 case.

Often, coping strategies (technological or institutional interventions), developed by planners, become counter-productive as they are not in cognizance with the end user community. This study presents a methodology to enable incorporation of community knowledge and expectations in planning by integrating participatory rural appraisal (PRA) with geographic information systems, leading to better informed coping strategies. As part of this, we create thematic maps which: (i) capture information on a spatial scale (otherwise lost during PRA), (ii) facilitate community participation for further research and planning in their contexts, and, (iii) co-create knowledge to develop a shared understanding of water-related hazards at the village level. The proposed methodology is presented through three case study sites - two in the plains (,500 masl) and one in the middle (500-1,500 masl) elevation regions of Upper Ganga basin. We show how this way of approaching context analysis facilitates community involvement as well as co-creating a knowledge base which can help researchers and government officials with mindful planning of interventions in the area. © IWA Publishing 2019","Floods; Groundwater; Participatory geographical information system (PGIS); Springs; Upper Ganga basin; Water-related shocks",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076528089

This study provides a critical analysis of 34 selected smart city assessment tools to highlight their strengths and weaknesses and to examine their potential contribution to the evolution of the smart city movement. The selected tools are evaluated against an analysis framework that covers criteria related to comprehensiveness, stakeholder engagement, context sensitivity, strategic alignment, uncertainty management, interlinkages and interoperability, temporal dynamism, flexibility, feasibility, presentation and communication of the results, and action plans. Results indicate that selected tools have achieved limited success in addressing these criteria. In particular, only few tools have addressed criteria related to stakeholder engagement, uncertainty management, interlinkages, and feasibility. The paper argues that assessment tools should capitalize on the advancements in smart solutions and big data analytics to develop better strategies for addressing these criteria. In addition to highlighting weaknesses that need to be addressed in the future, results of this study can be used by interested target groups such as smart city developers, planners, and policy makers to choose tools that best fit their needs. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Assessment tool; Climate change mitigation and adaptation; Critical analysis; Indicator; Smart city; Sustainability","Climate change; Data Analytics; Economic and social effects; Indicators (instruments); Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Analysis frameworks; Assessment tool; Climate change mitigation; Context sensitivity; Critical analysis; Design and implementations; Stakeholder engagement; Uncertainty management; Smart city",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067563612

Recognizing the potentially catastrophic ramifications of inaction, local governments are increasingly involved in resilience-building activities that are informed by a vast body of research related to different socio-economic, environmental, and institutional aspects of urban planning and design. However, despite its significant impacts on growth and evolution of cities, limited research exists on how urban form can enhance resilience by increasing the abilities to plan for, absorb, recover from, and adapt to adverse events. As a step towards filling this gap, this paper explores how meso-scale urban form elements can affect urban resilience. This is done through synthesizing theoretical and empirical evidence reported in the literature. The focus is on morphological parameters related to the following urban form elements: neighborhoods, blocks, lots, and open spaces. Results show that existing evidence is mainly related to the associations between ‘neighborhood density, size and configuration of open spaces, and land use mix’ and resilience to ‘climate change impacts’, ‘earthquakes’, ‘social issues’, and ‘resource scarcity’. There is also considerable evidence on the association between design of blocks/lots and resilience in terms of climate change adaptation/mitigation and adaptability to changing circumstances. The analysis also shows that each element influences and is influenced by other elements in the urban system and different elements should not be studied in isolation and the interplay between them should be considered. Existing evidence on conflicts is mainly related to density, but measures related to other elements may also involve conflicts. The paper concludes with a set of recommendations for future research towards improving resilience of urban form at the meso-scale. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change mitigation and adaptation; Neighborhood; Urban block; Urban form resilience; Urban lot; Urban open spaces","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; neighborhood; open space; urban area; urban design; urban morphology; urban planning; urban system; urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066240019

Meanwhile, as the largest developing country, China gives top priority to economic development, especially balanced regional development. In order to narrow regional development inequality, China has formulated some economic zone plannings to weaken market segmentation. However, existing studies pay little attention to the impacts of intra-national trade barrier on CO2 emissions within China. This is the first study to investigate the impact of market segmentation on urban CO2 emissions in China, taking the Yangtze River Delta region as a sample that is the most developed region with a high economic integration in China. Using a city-level panel data set during the period of 1995–2014 and the fixed effect model, we verify the nonlinear relationship between market segmentation and urban CO2 emissions measured by three indicators, i.e., total CO2 emissions, per capita CO2 emissions and CO2 emissions per unit of GDP. We also use the generalized method of moments (GMM) to control the endogeneity problem, and further adopt the threshold regression model to check the robustness of the baseline results. The results show that there is a U-shaped curve relationship between market segmentation and urban CO2 emissions. A low level of market segmentation restrains CO2 emissions, while a high level of market segmentation promotes CO2 emissions. This finding is helpful to understand CO2 emission trends and narrow regional economic inequality accompanied with the implementation of China's economic zone plannings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; GMM; Market segmentation; Regional inequality; The Yangtze river delta region; Threshold regression model","carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; developing world; economic development; emission control; environmental economics; environmental impact assessment; global perspective; Gross Domestic Product; market conditions; regional development; regression analysis; segmentation; threshold; urban pollution; Article; carbon footprint; China; economic development; regression analysis; river; urban area; China; city; China; Yangtze River; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Economic Development; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071712821

In addition, the compounding effects of adding personal vehicles, increasing density of road traffic and intensifying parking difficulties are indirectly promoting proliferation of small-size vehicles in large cities. Hence, there is a need to develop a microcar with zero emission. Thus, electric microcar is probably the simplest, green and energy efficient vehicle that relatively affordable and easily maneuverable in cities. However, a careful analysis is required in order to properly evaluate the propulsion system component sizing, vehicle dimension, performance and weight. This paper mainly focuses on design options and modeling of electric microcar using hub motors followed by analysis. A two seater electric microcar analytical model using MATLAB has been carried out for sizing of powertrain elements. CAD modeling of tubular frame chassis using solid works followed by analysis using ANSYS is also carried out.

The empirical results confirm the existence of cointegration between the variables in the presence of structural breaks. Moreover, the scale effect increases carbon dioxide emissions, but the technique effect reduces it as expected. Energy consumption also adds to carbon emissions, while the composition effect improves environmental quality by lowering carbon dioxide emissions. Further, trade openness decreases carbon dioxide emissions. However, increases in FDI hamper environmental quality by increasing carbon emissions. To reduce the level of carbon emissions, the technical processes of production should be improved by investing in technological innovations and capital stock and upgrading environmental regulations to channel in environment-friendly FDIs.

Expanded quantification of disease due to environmental health (EH) risk factors, including climate change, will enhance accuracy of GBD estimates, which will contribute to developing cost-effective policies that promote prevention and achieving Sustainable Development Goals. OBJECTIVES: We review key aspects of the GBD for the EH community and introduce the Global Burden of Disease–Pollution and Health Initiative (GBD-PHI), which aims to work with IHME and the GBD study to improve estimates of disease burden attributable to EH risk factors and to develop an innovative approach to estimating climate-related disease burden—both current and projected. METHODS: We discuss strategies for improving GBD quantification of specific EH risk factors, including air pollution, lead, and climate change. We highlight key methodological challenges, including new EH risk factors, notably evidence rating and global exposure assessment. DISCUSSION: A number of issues present challenges to the scope and accuracy of current GBD estimates for EH risk factors. For air pollution, minimal data exist on the exposure–risk relationships associated with high levels of pollution; epidemiological studies in high pollution regions should be a research priority. For lead, the GBD’s current methods do not fully account for lead’s impact on neurodevelopment; innovative methods to account for subclinical effects are needed. Decisions on inclusion of additional EH risk–outcome pairs need to be guided by findings of systematic reviews, the size of exposed populations, feasibility of global exposure estimates, and predicted trends in exposures and diseases. Neurotoxicants, endocrine-disrupting chemicals, and climate-related factors should be high priorities for incorporation into upcoming iterations of the GBD study. Enhancing the scope and methods will improve the GBD’s estimates and better guide prevention policy. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5496. © 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The connection between the mode of extensional fault reactivation, resulting fault shape and extensional fold growth is well-established. The impact of folding on accommodation evolution and growth package architecture, however, has received little attention; particularly the role-played by fault-perpendicular (transverse) folding. We study a multiphase rift basin with km-scale fault displacements using a large high-quality 3D seismic data set from the Fingerdjupet Subbasin in the southwestern Barents Sea. We link growth package architecture to timing and mode of fault reactivation. Dip linkage of deep and shallow fault segments resulted in ramp-flat-ramp fault geometry, above which fault-parallel fault-bend folds developed. The folds limited the accommodation near their causal faults, leading to deposition within a fault-bend synclinal growth basin further into the hangingwall. Continued fold growth led to truncation of strata near the crest of the fault-bend anticline before shortcut faulting bypassed the ramp-flat-ramp structure and ended folding. Accommodation along the fault-parallel axis is controlled by the transverse folds, the location and size of which depends on the degree of linkage in the fault network and the accumulated displacement on causal faults. We construct transverse fold trajectories by tracing transverse fold hinges through space and time to highlight the positions of maximum and minimum accommodation and potential sediment entry points to hangingwall growth basins. The length and shape of the constructed trajectories relate to the displacement on their parent faults, duration of fault activity, timing of transverse basin infill, fault linkage and strain localization. We emphasize that the considerable wavelength, amplitudes and potential periclinal geometry of extensional folds make them viable targets for CO2 storage or hydrocarbon exploration in rift basins. © 2019 The Authors.

This study developed and compared eight manure management scenarios across their entire life cycles, rom excretion to transport to land, considering technical, environmental and economic aspects. The scenarios based on combinations of collection, sand separation, solid/liquid (S/L) separation, anaerobic digestion (AD), composting, and storage were compared. Mass balances, costs and benefits and greenhouse emissions were evaluated. The model framework was tested and validated for a large-scale dairy farm with 9000 heads of cattle and daily manure production of approximately 505 t in Iran. The study indicated that sand separation and S/L separation did not contribute to a change in manure nutrients or emissions but reduced sand, maintenance cost, and transport requirements. AD followed by separation achieved the highest emission reduction (27.7 kg CO2eq t−1) due to the avoided emissions from replacing fossil fuels by renewable energy. Composting method had the lowest costs; however it resulted in a low nutrient recovery efficiency and high nitrous oxide emission. The assessment revealed that AD is a promising management option yielding a high potential greenhouse gas savings, nutrients recovery and nitrogen availability in fertilizer for plants. In spite of the high investment costs of AD, it could be a profitable strategy due to the high subsidies paid to renewable energy projects in Iran. In conclusion, this study showed that the choice of manure treatment method has a strong influence on nutrients, profitability and greenhouse gas balances by performing sensitivity analysis. The results of this study and the application of this model further indicate the need to consider various significant impacts, farm specifications and local conditions to decide the best manure management options. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anaerobic digestion; Cost-benefit analysis; Dairy; Environmental analysis; Manure management","Agriculture; Anaerobic digestion; Costs; Dairies; Emission control; Energy policy; Environmental management; Fossil fuels; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Life cycle; Manures; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Nutrients; Profitability; Sensitivity analysis; Separation; Costs and benefits; Environmental analysis; Greenhouse emissions; Greenhouse gas balance; Manure management; Nitrogen availability; Nitrous oxide emissions; Renewable energy projects; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068064472

To eliminate the magnitude of these changes we must fight for the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. In this regard, it is necessary to take concrete measures that require an understanding of the complex system of links between emissions from different sources and their impact at national or regional level. As the industry develops, economic activities release in the atmosphere increasing quantities of greenhouse gases (CO2), quantities that cannot be captured in the natural carbon circuit. Earth observation systems permanently monitor carbon dioxide concentrations, which in 2016 the number of parts per million (ppm) exceeded the 400ppm threshold.

The physical properties of C-TiO2 samples were characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The photocatalytic activities were checked through the photodegradation of phenolphthalein (PHP) under ultraviolet irradiation. The UV spectrum showed that the carbon doping extends the absorption range of TiO2 to the visible region. However, the photocatalytic activity is affected by the electron–hole recombination phenomenon, as revealed by the photoluminescence (PL) study. According to the PL spectra, carbon doping reduces the edge-to-edge electron–hole recombination. Nevertheless, the number of defect sites is greatly influenced by the calcination temperature of C-TiO2. C-TiO2 that was calcined at 400°C showed the highest photodegradation percentage of PHP, which was mainly attributed to the synergic effect of the low direct edge-to-edge electron–hole recombination, high content of defect sites, and retention of active electrons on the surface hydroxyl group. © 2019 The Chemical Society Located in Taipei & Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This paper uses a novel dataset compiled from operator reports and infrastructure monitoring data obtained from three different US federal agencies to assess the performance of retail gas utilities nationwide in terms of addressing gas leaks and minimizing leaked volume. Our panel data set includes yearly observations for 727 retail gas utilities from 2009 to 2017. We show that safety hazards and environmental costs of gas leaks are widespread across providers that vary in terms of ownership, size, and region. We then use a series of Bayesian hierarchical models to regress four outcome variables—hazardous leaks, end-year unfixed leaks, total gas volume leaked, and significant incidents—on infrastructure conditions, regional service context, and socio-economic service population characteristics. Unlike what is observed in other critical infrastructure cases such as drinking water, socio-economic conditions are not strongly predictive of service outcomes. Additionally, public utilities exhibit better environmental performance on average, and no difference in maintenance backlogs. Because the environmental costs of poor performance—primarily in terms of methane greenhouse gas emissions—are predominantly social, policy tools such as consolidation and privatization are unlikely to improve environmental outcomes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Demographics; Gas distribution; Leaks; Performance; Privatization; Utilities","Environmental management; Gas hazards; Greenhouse gases; Hierarchical systems; Potable water; Privatization; Public utilities; Demographics; Gas distribution; Leaks; Performance; Utilities; Gas emissions; environmental management; gas supply; industrial performance; infrastructure; leakage; methane; performance assessment; privatization; retailing; safety; service sector; utility sector; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069813110

However, new expectations have emerged from society on the functions that agricultural land should deliver, including the expectations that land should regulate and purify water, should sequester carbon to contribute to the mitigation of climate change, should provide a home for biodiversity and allow for the sustainable cycling of nutrients in animal and human waste streams. Through a series of reforms of the CAP, these expectations, or ‘societal demands’ have translated into a myriad of EU and national level policies aimed at safeguarding the sustainability and multifunctionality of European agriculture, resulting in a highly complex regulatory environment for land managers. The current reform of the CAP aims to simultaneously simplify and strengthen policy making on environmental protection and climate action, through the development of Strategic Plans at national level, which allow for more targeted and context-specific policy formation. In this paper, we contribute to the knowledge base underpinning the development of these Strategic Plans by mapping the variation in the societal demands for soil functions across EU Member States, based on an extensive review of the existing policy environment relating to sustainable and multifunctional land management. We show that the societal demands for primary production, water regulation and purification, carbon sequestration, biodiversity and nutrient cycling vary greatly between Member States, as determined by population, farming systems and livestock densities, geo-environmental conditions and landscape configuration. Moreover, the total societal demands for multifunctionality differs between Member States, with the lowest demands found in Member States that have designated the higher shares of EU CAP funding towards ‘Pillar 2′ expenditure, aimed at environmental protection and regional development. We review which lessons can be learnt from these observations, in the context of the proposals for the new CAP for the period 2021–2027, which include enhanced conditionality of direct income support for farmers and the instigation of eco-schemes in Pillar 1, in addition to Agri-Environmental and Climate Measures in Pillar 2. We conclude that the devolution of planning to Strategic Plans at national level provides an opportunity for more effective and targeted incentivisation of sustainable land management, provided that these plans take account for variations in the societal demand for soil functions, as well as the capacity of contrasting soils to deliver on this multifunctionality. © 2019 The Authors","Agriculture; EU; LANDMARK; Policy; Soil; Sustainability","article; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate; environmental protection; Europe; European Union; expectation; farming system; funding; human; knowledge base; landscape; livestock; management; nonhuman; nutrient cycling; soil; water transport",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068175122

Few studies have documented if and how they are used more than five years after being introduced. We conducted a 9-year prospective cohort study among young rural women in the highlands of Michoacan, Mexico. Participants had received a Patsari ICS during a community trial either in 2005 or 2006. With retrospective information collected in 2012–13, we studied the households' energy use, ICS survival, and cooking practices during the follow-up period. Using an exposure model constructed with personal PM2.5 measurements in a subsample of homes at the time of the initial trial in 2005, we estimated the exposure associated with different energy use patterns during the follow-up period. The ICS had a mean lifespan of 4 years, after which more than half of the stoves were not in use; therefore, the use of open fire increased, particularly among the indigenous communities. ICS use peak was achieved two years after the initial trial, either exclusively or combined with open fire. Yearly household energy use and other variables were used to estimate chronic air pollution exposure. Mean PM2.5 exposure during the follow-up period ranged from 51 to 319 μg/m3; the median was 102 and 146 μg/m3 for mainly ICS and mainly open fire use, respectively. The ICS has a useful period after which it needs maintenance, repair, or replacement. Unfortunately, many programs have not afforded a follow-up component. Exposure to biomass smoke air pollutants can be reduced by using an ICS instead of the traditional open fire.

There is little research on the carbon storage capabilities within agroforestry systems let alone food forests and it is considered an underexploited option for carbon storage. This case study quantified the carbon stored within the above and below ground components of all tree layer woody biomass above 2 m in height and greater than 2 cm diameter at breast height (DBH) in the Agroforestry Research Trust's peri-urban food forest in Devon, UK. The study formed a population census, which measured all 528 trees across 68 species within the 0.64 ha food forest. Twenty-three allometric equations were used to estimate above ground biomass (AGB) while the below ground biomass (BGB) was calculated using a root to shoot ratio of 0.18:1. The stored carbon content was calculated as 50% of the total biomass. The temperate food forest case study site was estimated to store 39.53 ± 4.05 Mg C ha−1 in above and below ground living biomass. This result highlights the potential for a food forest stand to store a considerable amount of carbon that is at least within a similar range to other literature sourced urban and peri urban land uses. Thus, a purposely selected food forest assemblage whose primary focus is food production can also be a valuable carbon sink The results offer a promising initial study into the carbon storage potential within a food forest, which is only made more valuable given the other prospective benefits of food forests. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Allometric equations; Carbon storage; Food forestry; Population census; Temperate agroforestry; Tree biomass","aboveground biomass; allometry; belowground biomass; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; food production; periurban area; polyculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073157265

In this paper, we present projections for those emissions from 2015 to 2040. We calculated the climate impact of the emissions using regional temperature potential metrics presented in literature. In our results, the climate impacts are given as global and Arctic temperature responses caused by the studied emissions in a 25 year time span. The results show that SLCF emissions from RWC cause a significant warming impact. Using our selected metrics, SLCF emissions from RWC added to the warming impact of Finland's projected greenhouse gas emissions by 28% in global temperature response and by 170% in Arctic response. When compared with other common heating methods in Finnish detached houses, using a typical Finnish stove (masonry heater) was the least climate-friendly option.

Efficient utilization of energy is necessary for reduction of CO2 emission, and SC demonstration projects have been conducted around the world for reducing total energies and the amount of CO2 emission. The problem can be formulated as a mixed integer nonlinear programming problem and various evolutionary computation techniques such as particle swarm optimization, differential evolution, and DEEPSO have been applied to the problem. However, there is still room for improving solution quality. Multi-swarm based evolutionary computation methods have been verified to improve solution quality and the approach has a possibility for improving solution quality. Considering these backgrounds, the paper proposes total optimization of energy networks in an SC by MS-DEEPSO with only migration model and with only abest model. The results of MS-DEEPSO with both migration and abest, only migration, and only abest model based methods are compared with those by the original DEEPSO based method with a single swarm. Various migration topologies, migration policies and intervals, and the number of sub-swarms are also investigated. It is verified that MS-DEEPSO with both migration and abest model based method with hyper-cube topology and the W-B policy is the most effective among all of multi-swarm parameters. © 2018 IEEE.","Differential evolutionary particle swarm optimization; multi-swarm evolutionary computation; smart city","Calculations; Carbon dioxide; Integer programming; Mathematical models; Natural gas; Nonlinear programming; Optimization; Smart city; Standby power systems; Topology; Differential evolutionary; Heating system; Load modeling; Multi-swarms; Urban areas; Particle swarm optimization (PSO)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056714848

However, this fast pace is not in tandem with the expertise gained on how to design this building typology to best adjust it to local climates. In addition, the increased transparency of the building envelope from the mid-twentieth century onwards, resulted in high-energy loads, especially prominent in high-rise construction. With planning policies moving towards targets for low carbon built environments, this challenging typology needs further research and experimentation. This study focuses on the building envelope, as a passive design strategy towards reduced energy loads. Simulations of different envelope scenarios in the Mediterranean climate are conducted with EnergyPlus thermal simulation engine, and comparisons are made on energy loads in relation to height. Initial simulations between three single-skin envelope scenarios and a ventilated double skin façade (DSF) revealed the importance of lowering the high cooling loads relevant to the hot and humid climate, while external shading performed better from a double-skin envelope with LowE glazing as the interior layer. The focus then shifted on increasing the energy efficiency of the DSF, as a more advanced envelope option (controlled ventilation, acoustic insulation etc.), by drawing comparisons between four DSFs. Simulations showed that the most energy efficient DSF in the Mediterranean climate is with LowE glazing as the outside layer. In the final step, the comparison between the building envelope with the proposed DSF and the one with external shading was in favour of the DSF option. Conclusions are drawn on the relationship of the building envelope with climate, with a preference on DSF towards a low carbon building design, while suggestions are made for further DSF research. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building envelope; Double skin façade; Energy efficiency; EnergyPlus; Low-carbon high-rise; Mediterranean climate","Architectural design; Carbon; Climatology; Glazes; Solar buildings; Tall buildings; Building envelopes; Double skin; EnergyPlus; High rise; Mediterranean climates; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068267929

It demonstrates how the empirical study of several practices of legitimation can analytically deconstruct energy transitions, and presents a typology of these practices to help determine whether energy transitions contribute to sustainability. The real-world challenge of climate change requires sustainable energy transitions. This presents a crisis of accountability legitimated through situated practices in a wide range of cases including: solar energy transitions in Portugal, urban energy transitions in Germany, forestland conflicts in Indonesia, urban carbon emission targets in Norway, transport electrification in the Nordic region, and biodiversity conservation and energy extraction in the USA. By synthesising these cases, chapters identify various dimensions wherein practices of legitimation construct specific accountability relations. This book deftly illustrates the value of an analytical approach focused on accountable governance to enable sustainable energy transitions.

In order to maintain a clean environment for a sustainable agricultural system in oil palm plantation, the quality of POME and its level must be monitored to ensure that the requirement set by the country is met. Hence, this paper is written based on the data of POME final discharge into waterways taken from Malaysian Department of Environment in four regions of Perak, Malaysia. The data is compared between regions and relatively different levels of discharge have been produced. Some of the mills produce final POME wastewater above the limit that has been set. The remaining mills discharge the wastewater below the maximum allowed level. This is an indicator that each mill has its own Standard of Procedures in treating POME before being discharged into waterways. It is suggested that the mills take a proactive approach to treat POME beyond the ponding system. POME can be physically processed to produce biofertilizer and biocompost for organic farming. The mills apply phytoremediation techniques in treating POME to reduce the unwanted variables that can affect the sustainability of our environment. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agriculture; Bioremediation; Effluents; Palm oil; Water pollution; Bio fertilizers; Clean environment; Oil palm plantations; Organic farming; Palm oil mill effluents; Phytoremediation; Pro-active approach; Sustainable agricultural system; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074669105

This is meant to match locally adapted populations with anticipated environments, but adaptive traits do not always show population differences suitable to mitigate climate change impacts. For white spruce, drought tolerance is a critical adaptive trait to prevent mortality and productivity losses. Here, we use a 40-year-old provenance experiment that has been exposed to severe drought periods in 1999 and 2002 to retrospectively investigate drought response and the adaptive capacity of white spruce populations across their boreal range. Relying on dendrochronological analysis under experimentally controlled environments, we evaluate population differences in resistance, resilience, and recovery to these extreme events. Results showed evidence for population differentiation in resistance and recovery parameters, but provenances conformed to approximately the same growth rates under drought conditions and had similar resilience metrics. The lack of populations with better growth rates under drought conditions is contrary to expectations for a wide-ranging species with distinct regional climates. Populations from the wettest environments in the northeastern boreal were surprisingly drought-tolerant, suggesting that these populations would readily resist water deficits projected for the 2080s, and supporting the view that northeastern Canada will provide a refugium for boreal species under climate change. The findings also suggest that white spruce is sensitive to growth reductions under climate change in the western boreal. The study highlights that population differentiation in adaptive capacity is species- and trait-specific, and we provide a counterexample for drought tolerance traits, where assisted migration prescriptions may be ineffective to mitigate climate change impacts. For resource managers and policy makers, we provide maps where planning for widespread declines of boreal white spruce forests may be unavoidable. © 2019 The Authors.

Oxygen poor and anoxic lake bottom conditions in estuarine brackish lakes Shinji and Nakaumi could prevent the oxidization of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and preserve a record of PAHs in sediments. PAHs emitted from wood and/or grass burning have been analyzed for composition and concentrations during the last ∼300 years. Carbonized plant material which remained after artificial agricultural fires and heating experiments have been used to estimate fire temperature. The equation relating maximum temperature and hydrogen to carbon (H/C) atomic ratio of the charcoal is as follows: Temp (°C) = 317 x (H/C)−0.708 (R2 = 0.924, 200–700 °C). These experiments and the gas chromatography - mass spectrometry analysis of PAHs on the charcoals suggest that PAHs were primarily produced at temperatures less than 500 °C in the burning of wild plants. The PAHs contents in the two sediment cores were not related to total organic carbon (TOC) contents and emission of industrial waste, and were directly due to fire events in this region. Although TOC contents of the sediments were constant at about 0.5% in Lake Shinji and 1.0% in Lake Nakaumi before ca. 1900 CE, and increased up to about 4% due to recent nutrient discharge, the profiles of PAHs contents were completely different. The sediment cores contained the following PAHs: phenanthrene (P), fluoranthene (Fla), pyrene (Py), benz[a]anthracene (BaAn), benzofluoranthenes (Bflas), benzo[e]pyrene (BePy), indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (InPy) and benzo[ghi]perylene (BghiP). The contents of 6-ring InPy and BghiP, high temperature markers, are lower than those of the other low ring Py, BaAn, Bflas and BePy, showing low to medium intensity/temperature fire events. Relatively higher BaAn contents suggest that the PAHs were carried and deposited in the sediments for a short period after the fire. The PAHs peak groups B (1830–1870 CE) and C (1920 CE) may be attributed to the burning of wood buildings in Matsue City, and the PAHs peak group period D (1970–1980 and 2000–2007 CE) could be mainly due to forest fires. The general increase in PAHs after 1850 CE could be caused by climate change after the Little Ice Age. The PAHs with maximum total peak concentrations at 30–34 cm depth (1850 CE: 4890 ng g−1) in Lake Shinji and at 8–12 cm depth (1970–1980 CE: 2030 ng g−1) in Lake Nakaumi are not at a toxic level. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Brackish lake sediment core; Historic fire; Lakes Shinji and Nakaumi; Little ice age; PAHs; Toxicity","brackish water; climate change; concentration (composition); estuarine environment; experimental study; lacustrine deposit; Little Ice Age; PAH; paleoenvironment; proxy climate record; sediment core; toxicity; watershed; Chugoku; Honshu; Japan; Lake Nakaumi; Lake Shinji; Shimane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068562229

A specific location is chosen by the Lake Ohrid in Macedonia. The house is designed for a single family, with dimensions and materials selected according to recommendations in the literature. It is not connected to the public infrastructural network, reducing its dependence on public services and the use of fossil fuels. It is built of natural and recycled materials, having thermal solar heating and cooling, collection and storage of rain water, controlled wastewater treatment, power from sun or wind and food self-production. Static and dynamic analysis has been performed and stability in this highly seismic region is confirmed, followed by the analysis of the energy efficiency and bill of quantities. This design meets the passive house criteria and the planned investment is considerably lower in comparison to a passive house built of “standard” building materials. The potential benefits of this designed Earthship might have an impact in the future building construction and architecture in Macedonia, especially for suburbs. They might help raise people’s awareness of the benefits of sustainable architecture: reduction of the greenhouse gas emission, saving fresh water reserves by harvesting rainwater and reusing it as grey water, controlling the micro climate of the suburban areas by using energy efficient materials and choosing the right location for building. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

With the expanding industrial sectors, many international conventions were established in order to reduce the emission of dioxins in the past two decades. The Stockholm convention, a global monitoring treaty, entered into force in 2004 with the aim to promote development of strategies to reduce or eliminate dioxin emissions. According to the convention, parties are required to develop national inventory databases to report emission levels and develop a national implementation plan (NIP) to reduce further dioxin emissions. In order to understand the trend of dioxin emissions since 1990s this study provides a comparative assessment of dioxin emissions from different industrial sources by deriving emission data from the national inventory databases of Australia, Canada and the 28 European countries (EU-28). According to the data collected, iron and steel production and electricity generation were the highest emitters of dioxins in 2017 for Europe, Canada and Australia, when compared to other stationary industrial sources. The change in the trend of dioxin emissions from the iron and steel industry and the public electricity sector was also assessed. The emission of dioxins during 1990-2017 from both iron and steel production and electricity generation revealed a relative decreasing trend, except for Spain and Italy who showed higher level of emissions from iron and steel production in 2017. Furthermore, comparing emission data for metal production revealed that the blast furnace process was the prominent emitter of dioxins comparing to electric arc furnace process. Further investigation was performed to compare the amount of dioxin emitted from three different fuel types, black coal, brown coal and natural gas, used for electricity generation in Australia. The study showed that dioxin emissions from brown coal were higher than black coal for the last two years, while power production from natural gas emits the lowest amounts of dioxins to the environment. © 2019 Salian et al.",,"activated carbon; dioxin; iron; lignite; natural gas; steel; dioxin; Article; Australia; Canada; comparative study; controlled study; electric arc furnace; electric power plant; electricity; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; European Union; furnace; hospital waste; industrial waste; municipal waste; pollutant; power supply; environmental monitoring; factual database; industrial waste; pollutant; Australia; Canada; Databases, Factual; Dioxins; Electric Power Supplies; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; European Union; Industrial Waste; Iron; Steel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074151761

A framework was developed to measure the CED quality. The relationships between CED volume and quality were examined using the ordered probit regression model. Findings: CED volume in annual reports and HEFCE carbon reduction target were found to have a significant positive impact on CED quality. There exists a void in research with carbon disclosures by HEIs, an area which has been widely researched with regard to profit-seeking organisations. The study adds to the earlier related studies by its contribution about HEIs to the disclosure literature. Research limitations/implications: The study is distinct in investigating the relationship between volume and quality of CED by HEIs. However, the impact of CED would need to be clear to motivate the HEIs to engage in such disclosure. Thus, future studies should investigate the impact of both volume and quality of CED on reputation. Originality/value: The study recognises that the characteristics of HEIs are distinct from profit-seeking organisations, which have been widely researched in literature. Generalising the research studies on profit-oriented companies for the most publicly funded UK HEIs may mislead any outcome. This study is distinct from the reader’s point of view in exploring whether more CED is more useful in better decision-making. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Annual reports; Carbon emission disclosures; Higher education funding council of England; Higher education institutions; Stewardship theory",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067860756

Recently, populations of this tick have been reported to be present close to the Canadian border in Michigan and New York states, but established populations are not known in Canada. Previous research suggests that changing temperature patterns with climate change may influence tick life cycles and permit northward range expansion of ticks in the northern hemisphere. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to estimate minimal temperature conditions for survival of A. americanum populations at the northern edge of the tick’s range and to investigate the possibility of range expansion of A. americanum into northern U.S. states and southern Canada in the coming decades. METHODS: A simulation model of the tick A. americanum was used, via simulations using climate data from meteorological stations in the United States and Canada, to estimate minimal temperature conditions for survival of A. americanum populations at the northern edge of the tick’s range. RESULTS: The predicted geographic scope of temperature suitability [≥3,285 annual cumulative degree days (DD) &gt; 0°C] included most of the central and eastern U.S. states east of longitude 110°W, which is consistent with current surveillance data for the presence of the tick in this region, as well as parts of southern Quebec and Ontario in Canada. Regional climate model output raises the possibility of northward range expansion into all provinces of Canada from Alberta to Newfoundland and Labrador during the coming decades, with the greatest northward range expansion (up to 1,000 km by the year 2100) occurring under the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5. Predicted northward range expansion was reduced by approximately half under the reduced GHG emissions of RCP4.5. DISCUSSION: Our results raise the possibility of range expansion of A. americanum into northern U.S. states and southern Canada in the coming decades, and conclude that surveillance for this tick, and the diseases it transmits, would be prudent. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP5668. © 2019, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

To reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to meeting the Paris agreement targets, Croatia should map this potential. The most prospective region is the SW corner of the Pannonian basin, but there are also offshore opportunities in the Northern and Central Adriatic. Three “geological storage plays” are suggested for detailed exploration in this province. Firstly, there are three small gas fields (Ida, Ika and Marica) with Pliocene and Pleistocene reservoirs suitable for storage and they can be considered as the first option, but only upon expected end of production. Secondly, there are Miocene sediments in the Dugi otok basin whose potential is assessed herein as a regional deep saline aquifer. The third option would be to direct future exploration to anticlines composed of carbonate rocks with primary and secondary porosity, covered with impermeable Miocene to Holocene clastic sediments. Five closed structures of this type were contoured with a large total potential, but data on their reservoir properties allow only theoretical storage capacity estimates at this stage. © 2019 by the authors.

The complete study is divided into two parts; this paper covers technologies and combustion sources in residential, industrial, commercial, agricultural diesel-use and transport sectors as Part I (NEEMI-Tech), while emissions from the open burning of municipal waste and agricultural residue in fields and fugitive emissions from waste management, paddy fields, enteric fermentation and manure management for the period 2001-2016 will be covered in Part II (NEEMI-Open).

The Nepal emission inventory provides, for the first time, temporal trends of fuel and energy consumption and associated emissions in Nepal for a long period, 2001-2016. The energy consumption showed an increase by a factor of 1.6 in 2016 compared to 2001, while the emissions of various species increased by a factor of 1.2-2.4. An assessment of the top polluting technologies shows particularly high emissions from traditional cookstoves and space-heating practices using biomass. In addition, high emissions were also computed from fixed-chimney Bull's trench kilns (FCBTKs) in brick production, cement kilns, two-wheeler gasoline vehicles, heavy-duty diesel freight vehicles and kerosene lamps. The monthly analysis shows December, January and February as periods of high PM<span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">2.5</span> emissions from the technology-based sources considered in this study. Once the full inventory including open burning and fugitive sources (Part II) is available, a more complete picture of the strength and temporal variability in the emissions and sources will be possible. Furthermore, the large spatial variation in the emissions highlights the pockets of growing urbanization, which emphasize the importance of the detailed knowledge about the emission sources that this study provides. These emissions will be of value for further studies, especially air-quality-modeling studies focused on understanding the likely effectiveness of air pollution mitigation measures in Nepal. © 2019 SPIE.

Here we compiled 2002, 2007, and 2012 inventories of inputs and nonhydrologic N outputs along with fossil fuel emissions, food demand, and terrestrial N surpluses for all subbasins of the contiguous United States using peer-reviewed, publicly available data sets. We found that at the national scale, total inputs, outputs, and surpluses changed little (±6%) between 2002 and 2012 and remained dominated by agricultural processes, despite efforts to curb N losses. This consistency at the national scale, however, obscured large counteracting shifts at regional levels driven by variable fluxes across regions. Throughout the eastern United States, declines in deposition and fertilizer inputs combined with increased crop yields resulted in a decrease in terrestrial N surpluses, which may explain recent water quality improvements in the region. On the other hand, fertilizer N inputs in the Midwest increased at a greater rate than crop harvest N increased, leading to a larger terrestrial surplus N. A large relative increase (~320%) in N emissions in the West due to an unusual wildfire season in 2012 was also observed. These changes coincided with national policies that decreased N emissions and increased demand for domestic biofuels, potentially highlighting the capacity to change the source and magnitude of N inputs and fluxes across the landscape through market and regulatory actions.

Here, we assess the effect of a bias in the high-frequency CO2 concentration measurements using the Campbell Scientific EC150 infra-red gas analyzer on the CO2 fluxes and field-scale carbon balances. The bias stems from using a lower frequency temperature measurement to calculate the CO2 density, which misses higher frequency temperature fluctuations. To generate the bias adjustment, data were collected over four similar agricultural sites as part of the Long-Term Agroecosystem Research network for multiple months using the same four instrument sets used in the REACCH project. The difference between the high-frequency and low-frequency CO2 fluxes were regressed against the kinematic heat fluxes to generate a correction equation for each instrument set, which were applied to the historical REACCH data to determine the effect of the bias on the measured and gap-filled flux values. The re-calculated positive biases in the measured fluxes were 40 gC-CO2 m−2 yr-1 to 126 gC-CO2 m−2 yr-1, indicating greater losses to the atmosphere than initially estimated. Once gap-filled, three out of fourteen site-years switched from weak carbon sinks to weak carbon sources. When the carbon exported via harvest was included in the budget calculation the bias correction still impacted the source/sink strength but did not change the sign of the carbon balance. Overall, the total net ecosystem exchange decreased between 300–470 gC-CO2 m-2 per site (29–46%) over the 4 crop-years from the bias adjustment process. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural carbon budget; Carbon flux bias; Eddy covariance","agricultural land; carbon balance; carbon flux; carbon sink; climate change; eddy covariance; flux measurement; source-sink dynamics; water budget; Pacific Northwest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067208514

The European Union (EU) first introduced a blending target in 2003 with the aim to reach a 5.75% share of renewable energy in the EU’s transport sector by 2010. A particular aspect of renewable energy policy is the promotion of biomass as a fuel. In analogy with biofuels, the 2018 Renewable Energy Directive introduces sustainability criteria for the first time. Integrated national energy and climate plans are at the core of the Energy Union Governance system.

The approach makes use of the fossil origin of this carbon, which is depleted in 13C. However, there is little data for desert environments. The Nevada Desert FACE Facility (NDFF), located in the Mojave Desert, has been one of the main facilities for the study of C dynamics in arid ecosystems and how they respond to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. In this experiment, we studied the incorporation of fixed CO2 during the previous two years (detectable by its lower δ13C) in the soil fraction surrounding roots. Methods: The soil was collected monthly in direct vicinity to the roots during a complete growth season, at two depths (5 and 15 cm). Soil samples were dried and fractionated by size (&gt; 50 μm and &lt; 50 μm) by wet sieving, and both size fractions were then analysed for the δ13C of their organic matter and their carbonates. Results: In the coarse fraction (&gt; 50 μm), δ13C values ranged between −1 and − 2‰ for carbonates and between −23 and − 25‰ for soil organic matter. These values did not significantly change throughout the experiment and were not affected by depth (5 or 15 cm). In contrast, δ13C values for both organic and inorganic carbon in the fine fraction (&lt; 50 μm) were much more variable than in the coarse fraction (&gt; 50 μm). The δ13C values for organic C ranged mostly between −20‰ and − 27‰, and were roughly maintained throughout the sampling period. For inorganic C, the δ13C values were mostly between 0‰ and − 15‰, and tended to become less negative during the course of the sampling period. Overall the effect of [CO2] on δ13C values of either organic or inorganic carbon was not significant for any experimental condition (plant species, soil depth, soil fraction). Conclusion: Little or no signs of recently fixed CO2 (13C-depleted) were detected in the soils close to the roots, in the coarse fraction (&gt; 50 μm), the fine fraction (&lt; 50 μm), the organic matter, or in carbonates. This indicates a slow C turnover in the studied soils, which can result from a highly conservative use of photoassimilates by plants, including a very low release of organic matter into the soil in the form of dead roots or root exudates, and from a conservative use of available C reserves. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon cycle; Carbon isotopes; Carbonates; Climate change; Desert plants; FACE experiments; Root exudates; Soil organic matter turnover","air-soil interaction; arid region; carbon cycle; carbon isotope; carbonate; climate change; desert; experimental study; exudation; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil organic matter; soil-vegetation interaction; turnover; Mojave Desert; Nevada; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070381126

While improvements in technology are commonly the expected general solution, lifestyle changes and modifications on consumption are also necessary to effectively reduce pollution. Such regulations may modify production activities, thus altering economic and social stability. Therefore, analyses need to consider numerous different aspects to locate suitable sectors in the economy in which emission reduction can be accomplished with the least socio-economic impact. Through an extended input–output analysis, this paper gives an insight into the intricate relationship of the sectors of an economic region and their respective greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Taking both a producer and a consumer-based perspective, sectors are analysed and categorised through various socio-economic and environmental indicators. The descriptive approach discerns between emission inventories of production activities and embodied emissions of consumption patterns, thus assigning a different responsibility to the carbon footprint of industrial activities. Further, an innovative multi-objective optimisation model is developed with consideration of Gross Domestic Product (GDP), GHG emissions, and employment. This methodology enables mapping an optimised space of scenarios for emission reduction through consumption limitation with a minimal socio-economic loss. The Australian economy was used as a case study. Results show a substantial difference in the allocation of emissions from a producer and a consumer perspective, indicating that many sectors rely on a small number of emissions-intensive sectors for their activities. Through the optimisation, all possible emission reductions are linked to consumption limit scenarios of minimised economic and employment losses. The model is effective in showing areas of interest for further scrutiny in consumption modification to meet a national agenda. Additionally, because of its adjustable and scalable configuration, the model can serve as the basis for future tailored analysis involving simultaneous multiple socio-economic and environmental impacts. © 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Carbon footprint; Consumption modification; Embodied emissions; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas; Input–output analysis; Multi-objective linear programming; Multi-objective optimisation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065965346

Previous research has explained the precipitation seasonality of eastern Africa in terms of the local monsoons. This research examines a wider range of hydroclimatic variables, including water vapour flux, evapotranspiration, runoff, and ocean salinity, and the sources of low-frequency atmosphere–ocean variability that support mangrove productivity and associated ecosystem services. Results confirm previous work suggesting that the northeast monsoon (kaskazi) largely corresponds to the “short rains” of October–December and extends through February, while the southeast monsoon (kusi) corresponds to the “long rains” of March–May and the drier June–September. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and, to a lesser extent, El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are important modulators not only of precipitation (as has been shown previously) but also of water vapour flux, evapotranspiration, runoff, and salinity variability. During kaskazi, positive (negative) hydroclimatic anomalies occur during positive (negative) IOD, with a stronger IOD influence occurring during its positive phase, when seasonal anomalies of precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff exceed +50, 25, and 100%, and nearby salinity decreases by 0.5 practical salinity units. During kusi, the contrast between the positive and negative IOD modes is subtler, and the pattern is dictated more by variability in “long rains” months than in the dry months. The coincidence of the positive IOD and El Niño amplify this hydroclimatic signal. Because previous work suggests the likelihood of increased tendency for positive IOD and increased moisture variability associated with El Niño events in the future, wetter conditions may accompany the kaskazi, with less change expected during the kusi. These results advance understanding of the key environmental drivers controlling mangrove productivity and wetland spatial distribution that provide ecosystem services essential to the well-being of the human population. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","climate; mangroves; observational data analysis; ocean; rainfall; seasonal; Tanzania; teleconnections; Tropics","Atmospheric pressure; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climatology; Evapotranspiration; Oceanography; Plants (botany); Productivity; Rain; Runoff; Tropics; Water vapor; Wetlands; climate; mangroves; Observational data; ocean; seasonal; Tanzania; Teleconnections; Ecosystems; annual variation; climate variation; El Nino; mangrove; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; seasonal variation; teleconnection; Tanzania; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066026184

By contrast, scholars have shown little interest in exploring the case of cross-boundary adaptation spillovers, where adaptation by one country affects other countries. Two decades of the economic literature on climate mitigation may contribute to bridge this research gap because the problem structure of climate mitigation resembles that of adaptation with cross-boundary spillovers. With this in mind, we ask the following research question: Are there lessons to be learned by applying a mitigation perspective to the governance of adaptation with cross-boundary spillovers? After reviewing the relevant adaptation and mitigation literature, the paper applies mitigation insights to an adaptation case with cross-boundary spillovers: climate change-induced eutrophication in the Baltic Sea. Insights on coalition structures, side-payments, issue-linkage, and trade sanctions provide novel perspectives on the governance structures in place. To improve cooperation on providing adaptation as a public good, smaller regional governance arrangements could be more effective, European subsidies for pollution control might be redirected, and progress on eutrophication could be made a precondition for cooperation on other areas. These perspectives depart both from the way the Baltic Sea eutrophication problem is addressed at present, and from the way public goods are addressed in the adaptation literature. They show that some lessons can indeed be learned, calling for further research. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Baltic Sea; Climate mitigation; Governance arrangements; Public goods; Spillovers; Transnational adaptation","adaptive management; climate change; conceptual framework; cross-border relations; environmental economics; environmental policy; governance approach; literature review; mitigation; multinational enterprise; public goods; spillover effect; strategic approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066504661

However in recent decades in Mediterranean areas, abandonment of agricultural areas due to lack of economic profits and to promoting tourism has fostered a change in land use that has impacted soil carbon. In line with this, the Majorca Island (Spain) could be a good study area to evaluate temporary changes in carbon stocks in soils in areas with a Mediterranean climate. The present study analysed the spatial distribution of SOCS and evaluated the temporal changes over 11 years in agricultural soils in relation to the influence of land use and land management’. The global carbon budget (estimated at 30 cm depth) on the Majorca Island was estimated at 31.23 Tg C, and showed wide spatial variability. As expected, SOCS was higher in the forest areas of the Tramuntana Mountain Range (&gt;100 Mg ha−1), while the lowest contents were found in agricultural use (79.3 Mg ha−1), located mainly in the centre and south of this island. The total C stored from 2006 to 2017 increased by 2.62 Tg C (15%) in agricultural areas on the island. We noted a major increase in SOCS in the agricultural zones on mountain slopes (&gt;2-fold higher), associated with abandoned crops in terrace cultivation, but grassland systems also increased. Nonetheless, the present study shows a sharp drop in SOCS in the centre and south of this island. This decrease was more pronounced in annual crops (−14.5%), which could be attributed to intensive soil management and increased irrigated land. Land abandonment has been indicated as the main potential to carbon sequestration in soil, but this potential for carbon sequestration is a finite process. Certain changes in agricultural practices on Majorca, and in rural Mediterranean areas in general, are necessary to avoid carbon loss in cropland soils. Adoption of conservation agriculture practices, e.g. cover crops, crop rotation, organic additions and reduced tillage techniques, can help increase SOC levels in rural Mediterranean areas. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Crop management; Geostatistics; Mediterranean soil organic carbon; Soil carbon sequestration; Spatial and temporal variation","abandoned land; agricultural land; agricultural management; agricultural practice; agricultural soil; agronomy; carbon sequestration; crop plant; cultivation; geostatistics; grassland; Mediterranean environment; soil carbon; soil management; spatial distribution; spatial variation; spatiotemporal analysis; temporal variation; Balearic Islands; Majorca; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066246973

Over the same period and similar geographic area, a prolonged and widespread marine mortality event occurred. From January to May 2013, low level rates of incidental morbidity and mortality of abalone (Haliotis rubra and H. laevigata) and at least 29 fish species were observed. Mortalities were geographically extensive from Port MacDonnell on the South Coast of South Australia to Point Drummond on Eyre Peninsula, and including two gulf systems, spanning approximately 2,900 km of coastline. Mortalities were investigated using gross pathology, histopathology, bacterial culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) techniques. Water samples were collected to assess water column nutrient status and phytoplankton biomass levels and community composition. High nutrient concentrations were suggestive of high phytoplankton productivity, with conditions conducive to diatom blooms. A harmful (abrasive) diatom, Chaetoceros coarctatus, was observed in higher concentrations than the historical average. Observed fish mortalities were restricted to a small proportion of the populations and primarily comprised of temperate small-bodied benthic inshore species. Fish histopathology was suggestive of prolonged stress (melanomacrophage aggregation in spleens and kidneys), physical gill damage (focal gill lesions likely caused by C. coarctatus) and lethal bacterial septicaemia. Infectious and notifiable diseases were ruled out in all fish and abalone samples. Abalone mortalities were also restricted to a small proportion of the population with thermal stress a likely contributing factor that resulted in terminal secondary bacterial infections. A marine heatwave event, which promoted blooms of algae, including C. coarctatus, was likely the primary cause of widespread marine mortalities throughout South Australia in 2013. With marine heatwaves projected to increase in frequency, duration and spatial extent, this investigation demonstrated that most at risk will be temperate species in shallow water habitats already at their upper thermal tolerance limits, particularly those with high site fidelity.

For this purpose, three potential alternative scenarios were analyzed using the Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning (LEAP) System; S1: Business As Usual; S2: Power Generation Master Plan; and S3: Sustainable Power Generation System. The main goal of this study is to analyze the possible alternatives for electricity supply and demand, fuel consumption, and the future structure of the Ecuadorian power generation system to transform the current system based on petroleum fuels into a sustainable system that consumes natural gas, and progressively introduces renewable power generation plants such as solar, wind, biomass, and hydroelectric until 2040. According to the estimated results through the inclusion of sustainable energy policies, S3 scenario relative to S1 scenario could reduce the average CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions by 11.72%, the average production costs by 9.78%, and the average petroleum fuel consumption by 15.95%. Consequently, a correct energy transition contributes to the protection of the environment and public health and has a direct effect on economic savings for the state, which benefits to improve the citizen's quality of life. © 2019 by the authors.","Electricity forecasting; GHG emissions; Scenarios analysis; Sustainable energy sources","carbon dioxide; demand-side management; electricity generation; electricity supply; forecasting method; greenhouse gas; hydroelectric power; scenario analysis; sustainability; Ecuador",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073429881

We used generalized additive models to explore the univariate response curves for the data and then performed structural equation modeling (SEM) and multi-group SEM analyses to evaluate the relationship between biodiversity and productivity. We found that the SEM model for the entire dataset explained about 60% of the variation in forest productivity. In addition, the variation associated with species richness was greater than variation due to climatic factors and the variation in climate factors was greater than the variation in soil factors (all relative to their contributions to productivity). The multi-group SEM showed a more predominant effect of biodiversity and climate on productivity in Mediterranean compared to temperate forests.

This study investigates carbon dioxide (CO2) dynamics along a boreal soil-stream transect using a state-of-the-art data set in combination with a spectral methodology to identify controls on stream CO2. The spectral decomposition of hourly observations revealed intermediate (multiday) to long-term (monthly) patterns across the upslope-riparian-stream continuum, with similar power law increases in CO2 concentration fluctuations with increasing period. High-frequency CO2 variabilities, specifically diel CO2 concentration fluctuations, were also identified at all locations but were substantially amplified in the stream compared to in the riparian groundwater. Moreover, the spectral coherence between soil and stream CO2 fluctuations was inconsistent and restricted to episodic events. In contrast, we found a strong and consistent spectral coherence between the riparian groundwater level and stream CO2 concentration, indicating a hydrological control on stream CO2 dynamics. However, during some time spans even these patterns were obscured, suggesting that additional processes, such as CO2 evasion and in-stream metabolism, modulated the influence from riparian sources. The scales and patterns of temporal coherences (or lack thereof) between CO2 at different points in the catchment, as well as with other factors, for example, groundwater levels and Photosynthetically Active Radiation, provide new perspectives on the range of processes governing stream CO2 dynamics. Thus, this study highlights the potential of using spectral decomposition of high-resolution, spatially distributed data of different types to investigate biogeochemical transformations and pathways linking terrestrial and aquatic systems. ©2019.

While many studies hint at possible relationships between travertine formation and global climate, none have investigated these connections on a global scale. Here we compile 1649 published travertine ages from six continents to test the hypothesis that global and/or regional changes in climate regulate travertine deposition. Peaks in bedded travertine ages occur with main frequencies that correspond to 100-kyr changes in global climate, where most peaks occur during glacial terminations or interglacial periods, including a large peak that coincides with the Early Holocene climatic optimum. Time–series analysis also suggests a possible connection with 41-kyr obliquity cycles. At regional scales, many peaks also correspond with local times of high precipitation or wet conditions. This can be attributed to higher groundwater recharge rates, providing the necessary water to form travertine. Many bedded travertine-depositing systems may therefore be water-limiting and sufficient CO2 may be present even during times of no travertine deposition. Exceptions to this conclusion are banded vein travertine deposits, which typically form during times of dry climate when water tables are low. Copyright © 2019 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.

Among these, radio frequency corona ignition systems, which produce a strong electric field at a frequency of about 1 MHz, can create discharges characterized by simultaneous thermal and kinetic effects. These devices can considerably increase the early flame growth speed, initiating the combustion process in a wide region, as opposed to the local ignition generated by traditional sparks. To explore the corona ignition behavior, experimental campaigns were carried out to investigate different operating conditions, in a constant volume calorimeter designed to measure the deposited thermal energy. The present work compares the combustion development generated by a traditional spark and the corona igniter through computational fluid dynamics simulations. First, simulations are carried out to reproduce the experimental results in the calorimeter, comparing the measured and predicted pressure traces in an inert environment. The validated approach is then applied in a second step to the engine simulations to predict the combustion behavior, using a RANS turbulence model. Computational results are able to reproduce the faster burn rate generated by the corona system in the initial stage of the combustion. © 2019 SAE International.

These have been shown to cross-correlate with the cosmic X-ray background, leading several authors to attribute the excess to a high-redshift growing black hole population. In order to investigate potential sources that could explain this excess, in this paper, we develop a new framework to compute the power spectrum of undetected sources that do not have constant flux as a function of halo mass. In this formulation, we combine a semi-analytic model for black hole growth and their simulated spectra from hydrodynamical simulations. Revisiting the possible contribution of a high-redshift black hole population, we find that too much black hole growth is required at early epochs for z > 6 accretion to explain these fluctuations. Examining a population of accreting black holes at more moderate redshifts, z ∼ 2-3, we find that such models produce a poor fit to the observed fluctuations while simultaneously overproducing the local black hole mass density. Additionally, we rule out the hypothesis of a missing Galactic foreground of warm dust that produces coherent fluctuations in the X-ray via reflection of Galactic X-ray binary emission. Although we firmly rule out accreting massive black holes as the source of these missing fluctuations, additional studies will be required to determine their origin. © 2019 Oxford University Press.

During two meetings, older adult participants developed recommendations following adaptation best practices. Recommendations focused on encouraging preparedness through workshops and informational materials tailored for older adults. Additional recommendations focused on enhancing community services to provide effective warning mechanisms, shelter access, ride sharing and transportation assistance, and establishing a telephone based clearinghouse for extreme weather and emergency resources for older adults. A prioritization exercise showed that the participants and city staff believed all recommendations were potentially effective and feasible. A summative evaluation showed that the participatory planning enhanced resilience by raising awareness among the older adult participants and city agencies, enhancing communication, and increasing the older adult participants' ability to self-advocate. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.","adaptation; climate change; elderly; participation; resilience; vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067404524

Continued warming in tundra ecosystems is proposed to result in increased invertebrate herbivory. However, empirical data about how current levels of invertebrate herbivory vary across the Arctic is limited and generally restricted to a single host plant or a small group of species, so predicting future change remains challenging. We investigated large-scale patterns of invertebrate herbivory across the tundra biome at the community level and explored how these patterns are related to long-term climatic conditions and year-of-sampling weather, habitat characteristics, and aboveground biomass production. Utilizing a standardized protocol, we collected samples from 92 plots nested within 20 tundra sites during summer 2015. We estimated the community-weighted biomass lost based on the total leaf area consumed by invertebrates for the most common plant species within each plot. Overall, invertebrate herbivory was prevalent at low intensities across the tundra, with estimates averaging 0.94% and ranging between 0.02 and 5.69% of plant biomass. Our results suggest that mid-summer temperature influences the intensity of invertebrate herbivory at the community level, consistent with the hypothesis that climate warming should increase plant losses to invertebrates in the tundra. However, most of the observed variation in herbivory was associated with other site level characteristics, indicating that other local ecological factors also play an important role. More details about the local drivers of invertebrate herbivory are necessary to predict the consequences for rapidly changing tundra ecosystems. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Background herbivory; Biomass loss; Climate change; Community-weighted average; Insects; Invertebrate; Tundra","aboveground biomass; biome; climate effect; herbivory; host plant; insect; invertebrate; leaf area; plant-herbivore interaction; tundra; Arctic; Hexapoda; Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072103141

Structural comparisons of the Azotobacter vinelandii Fe protein in the [Fe4S4]0 and [Fe4S4]+ states point to a possible asymmetric functionality of a highly conserved Arg pair in CO2 binding and reduction. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations provide further support for the asymmetric coordination of O by the “proximal” Arg and binding of C to a unique Fe atom of the all-ferrous cluster, followed by donation of protons by the proximate guanidinium group of Arg that eventually results in the scission of a C−O bond.

Indonesia still relies on fossil fuels as an energy source that dominates the national energy mix. Fossil energy has an impact on greenhouse gas emissions that threatens climate change. The role of the government through energy diversification policies has not provided maximum contribution to fulfil energy needs. This study aims to analyze the policy of developing renewable energy in reducing greenhouse gas emissions based on content and context policy, using qualitative method to explain and describe implementation of the renewable energy policy. Data were derived from primary and secondary sources which are conducted in the period of October - December 2018. The result shows that there were several factors from the content and context of policy that have a significant correlation in the renewable energy policy implementation. The political environment has a role in the implementation of policy content related to the benefits that will be perceived by the community. Other policies that influence renewable energy consumption like fuel and electricity subsidy and allocation of resources are needed to implement the policy. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Excellent performance requires movable insulation, operable shading, operable vents, and other adjustable elements, but effective methods for controlling their operation have not yet been established. In particular, the numerical optimization of interdependent passive heating and cooling parameters to maintain thermal comfort has not yet been demonstrated; development of simplified control strategies has not been explored; and resulting load reductions have not been estimated. Here, we investigate these problems in planning for the adaptive reuse of an historic brick office building in the Mediterranean climate of Berkeley, California. Using Hooke-Jeeves and particle-swarm optimizations of passive system parameters in a field-validated EnergyPlus model, constrained to develop monthly schedules responding only to time or temperature, we find that near-optimal configuration and control of passive solar collection eliminate over half of the baseline heating load; likewise, well-controlled shading and natural ventilation eliminate ∼80% of the cooling load. Together, these results reveal the magnitude of the passive space-conditioning resource in this energy-intensive region and demonstrate the power of simple, effective operational strategies to realize substantial energy savings. © 2019, © 2019 ASHRAE.",,"Air conditioning; Constrained optimization; Energy conservation; Heating; Investments; Office buildings; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Thermoelectric equipment; Ventilation; Configuration and control; Integrated passives; Mediterranean climates; Natural ventilation; Numerical optimizations; Operational strategies; Passive heating and cooling; Simplified control strategy; Cooling systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068161154

We measured facial nerve activity in brainstems isolated from tadpoles during early and late developmental stages, under normal and elevated levels of CO2.

Sectorial thinking – focusing on just one aspect of the problem or system – is increasingly understood to be inadequate to address linked social-ecological challenges. Holistic approaches that incorporate diverse stakeholders across scales, sectors, and knowledge systems are gaining prominence for addressing complex problems. Such ‘integrated landscape approaches’ have received renewed momentum and interest from the research, donor and practitioner communities, and have been subsumed in international conventions related to climate, biodiversity, and sustainable development. However, implementation efforts and tangible evaluation of progress continues to lag behind conceptual development. Failure of landscape approaches to adequately engage diverse stakeholders—in design, implementation and evaluation—is a contributing factor to their poor performance. Here we draw on consultation workshops, advances in the literature, and our collective experience to identify key constraints and opportunities to better engage stakeholders in tropical landscape decision-making processes. Specifically, we ask: (1) what are the key challenges related to effectively engaging multiple stakeholders in integrated landscape approaches and (2) what lessons can be learned from practitioners, and how can these lessons serve as opportunities to avoid duplicating future research efforts or repeating past perceptions of underperformance. We present our findings within three broad categories: (i) navigating complexity, (ii) overcoming siloed thinking, and (iii) incentivizing behavioral change; thus providing a useful starting point for overcoming inherent challenges associated with engaging stakeholders in landscape approaches. © 2019 The Authors","Conservation and development trade-offs; Landscape approach; Landscape governance; Multi-stakeholder dialogue; Sustainable development goals","biodiversity; climate change; conservation management; holistic approach; knowledge; landscape ecology; local participation; stakeholder; sustainable development; tropical environment",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071724840

Reducing ship-strike risk in this region is complicated by changes in ship traffic that resulted from air pollution regulations and economic factors. A diverse group of stakeholders was convened to develop strategies to reduce ship-strike risk in the Southern California Bight. Strategies proposed by some stakeholders included: (a) adding a shipping route; (b) expanding the existing area to be avoided (ATBA); and (c) reducing ship speeds. Location: Southern California Bight, off the coast of California, United States. Methods: We developed methods to estimate ship traffic in the stakeholder-derived strategies using 8 years of ship traffic data. To assess ship-strike risk for fin, humpback, and blue whales, we used habitat models developed from 7 years of survey data and home ranges derived from 53 blue whale tags. We defined collision risk as the co-occurrence between whales and ships. The risk of a lethal collision was calculated by multiplying collision risk by the probability that a collision is lethal, which is estimated using ship speed. Results: Speed reductions resulted in a large decrease in the risk of a lethal ship strike. Creating a shipping route or expanding the ATBA reduced the risk of a strike by removing traffic from a whale feeding area. Creating a shipping route was opposed by the United States Navy and the shipping industry, but expanding the ATBA was broadly supported. Main conclusions: Our analyses suggest that speed reductions and expanding the ATBA may provide an optimal solution for addressing stakeholder needs and reducing ship strikes in the Southern California Bight. The methods we developed can be used to address the global issue of balancing human use of the marine environment with the protection of whale populations. © 2019 The Authors.

Capture fisheries by fishing vessels, is mostly driven by fossil fuels that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions and forms one the largest contributor from the fisheries sector. Transportation of catches, from the landing centers using different modes of transport is another source of emissions which contribute significantly to the emissions. Fisheries may be impacted in different ways, which include changes in the distribution of species due to latitudinal shifts or changes in the productivity of the system through processes that are repercussions due to climate-induced changes. A diverse range of direct and indirect climate affects, including displacement and migration of coastal communities; impacts on infrastructure for fishing; and changes in the frequency, intensity and distribution of extreme events are predicted. The poorer and less empowered countries and individuals are more vulnerable to climate impacts, and the vulnerability of fisheries is likely to be higher in circumstances of overcapacity and over exploitation. The interactions related to climate change is often complex, which includes interactions between social, ecological and economic systems, and this makes future predictions very difficult, however steps are required to develop models that could help the policy makers to frame adaptation strategies. Fisheries governance should aim towards equitable and sustainable options and should be flexible enough to account for inherent uncertainties in the fisheries sector. However, adaptation may be costly, so mitigation of emissions and other factors that contribute significantly to climate related issues should be the main recourse. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Adaptation; Bycatch reduction devices; Fishery technology; Trawling",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085723706

In the first phase, Radish seed oil is converted into biodiesel by transesterification process. The properties of biodiesel blends (B0, B25, B50, B75, and B100) are evaluated and presented; tests were conducted at 1500 rpm constant speed with 220 bar of nozzle opening pressure and 23°bTDC of static injection timing as engine setup under steady state condition. The cylinder head, valves, and piston crown of the engine components were coated with 450 µm of PSZ and TiO2 by atmospheric plasma spray coating techniques (APS) for test purpose. From the test results, it could be observed that PSZ-coated mode of operation gives better specific fuel consumption (SFC) than the conventional diesel engine, slight hike in brake thermal efficiency, reduction in hydrocarbon by 16–30% and low level of CO in emissions were observed. However, the NOx increases by 17–23% when compared to conventional engine operation.

Biofilm formation is a universal trait, exhibited by microbes, when growing attached to natural and artificial surfaces. Microbial biofilms are an attractive subject, due to their important roles in the different sectors including agriculture, environment, industry, and health. Biofilms in agriculture have acquired interest due to their immense possibilities in crop production, protection, and improvement through their role in colonization of surface soils, roots/shoots of plants, and enabling proliferation in the desired niche, as well as enhancing soil fertility. Biofilm-forming microbes have been reported worldwide and they belong to Gram-positive, Gram-negative species, cyanobacteria, archaea, fungi, and microalgae. The microbial biofilm formation has been reported by all three domain systems of archaea, bacteria, and eukarya of different phylum including Actinobacteria, Ascomycota, Bacteroidetes, Basidiomycota, Chloroflexi, Crenarchaeota, Cyanobacteria, Euryarchaeota, Firmicutes, Oomycetes, and Proteobacteria. The most dominant genera involve in biofilms formation belong to Agrobacterium, Anabaena, Azospirillum, Azotobacter, Bacillus, Bradyrhizobium, Burkholderia, Gluconacetobacter, Paenibacillus, Pseudomonas, Rhizobium, Trichoderma, Xanthomonas, and Xylella. The agriculturally-important microbial communities and their interactions can have several implications on climate change, plant nutrition, plant protection, biofertilization, and bioremediation for sustainable agriculture and environments.

The model, previously tested on many field crops, is based on the “big leaf” Penman-Monteith (PM) formulation of T in which canopy resistance (rc) is modeled with respect to local climatological conditions in different plant water status. Here rc is expressed as a function of available energy, vapor pressure deficit and aerodynamic resistance, and the trees’ water status was evaluated by means of crop water stress index. On an hourly scale, the comparison with T measured by sap flow thermal dissipation technique shows good performances of the model for all investigated species under contrasting water stress conditions. At daily scale, T modeled is less accurate for all species, because of the lack of stationarity conditions in the PM approach. At seasonal scale, however, the model gives good estimation of T, with an underestimation of − 1% for Olea and Pinus and overestimation of + 8% for Citrus with respect to the measured T values. The proposed model needs species-specific experimental calibration, but it may have good perspective of applicability in supporting water irrigation planning in urban forestry. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"aerodynamics; dissipation; estimation method; hydrological modeling; Mediterranean environment; performance assessment; rainfall; sap flow; semiarid region; transpiration; tree; urban forestry; vapor pressure; Citrus; Citrus sinensis; Olea europaea; Pinus pinea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069866959

The stemflow component is frequently neglected in water budgeting for trees and shrubs due to its presumed small volume and limited research. Studies of stemflow in shrub species are especially rare. This study focuses on stemflow in shrubs and specifically examines its relationship to plant morphology and meteorological factors. Two individuals of three species, Prunus laurocerasus (common name “Otto Luyken”), Hydrangea quercifolia (common name “Alice”), and Itea virginica (common name “Little Henry”), were studied in an outdoor experiment in Philadelphia, PA during the 2015 growing season. Stemflow was collected using aluminum collars which had been attached to individual branches of each plant. Vinyl tubing conveyed the stemflow from the collars into collection bottles which were weighed after rain events. To relate stemflow to plant morphology, the vertical projected canopy area of each collared branch, branch attachment angle, stem circumference, and direction of collar were evaluated. To relate stemflow to meteorological conditions, the research also quantified rain depth, rain intensity, rain event duration, wind speed, wind direction, temperature, relative humidity, gust speed, and date and time of storm. The importance of each of these independent variables were studied using a forward stepwise linear regression. Stemflow averaged 7.6% of total incident rainfall on the canopy area of the monitored stems, with values ranging from 0 to 58% by branch and storm event. Species-specific averages were found to be 11.4, 7.0, and 4.4% for P. laurocerasus, H. quercifolia, and I. virginica, respectively. The results suggest a significant variation in stemflow by species. Statistical analysis determined that between 55 and 79% of the observed variation in stemflow can be explained by the regression model variables and gust speed and projected canopy area were determined to be significant across all regression models. Stemflow rates appear to be impacted by both inter-plant and local climate factors; however, additional research is needed to further refine the understanding of stem flow and canopy water budgeting. © Copyright © 2019 Rakestraw, Jacobson, Gurian and Montalto.","green infrastructure; H. quercifolia; I. virginica; P. laurocerasus; shrubs; stemflow",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073685715

Dust fallout samples were collected during year seasons in 2015 from three different sites according to traffic congestion from tested locations. Two parallel samples were taken from indoor and outdoor in all the studied points for comparison. The obtained results show that the number of different microorganisms in all dust samples was higher in the spring season as well as in the first months of the summer compared to winter or autumn seasons in different locations. It is worthy to state that the higher microbial content in falling dust samples was always associated with the high traffic effects from tested points. The higher microbial content was recorded in industrial district compared to other sites of living districts. In addition, microbial content was always higher in indoor samples compared to outdoor samples.

Natural rates of adaptation of corals may not be able to keep pace with climate warming. Several interventions have been proposed to fast-track thermal adaptation, including the intentional translocation of warm-adapted adults or their offspring (assisted gene flow, AGF) and the ex situ crossing of warm-adapted corals with conspecifics from cooler reefs (hybridization or selective breeding) and field deployment of those offspring. The introgression of temperature tolerance loci into the genomic background of cooler-environment corals aims to facilitate adaptation to warming while maintaining fitness under local conditions. Here we use research on selective sweeps and connectivity to understand the spread of adaptive variants as it applies to AGF on the Great Barrier Reef (GBR), focusing on the genus Acropora. Using larval biophysical dispersal modeling, we estimate levels of natural connectivity in warm-adapted northern corals. We then model the spread of adaptive variants from single and multiple reefs and assess if the natural and assisted spread of adaptive variants will occur fast enough to prepare receiving central and southern populations given current rates of warming. We also estimate fixation rates and spatial extent of fixation under multiple release scenarios to inform intervention design. Our results suggest that thermal tolerance is unlikely to spread beyond northern reefs to the central and southern GBR without intervention, and if it does, 30+ generations are needed for adaptive gene variants to reach fixation even under multiple release scenarios. We argue that if translocation, breeding, and reseeding risks are managed, AGF using multiple release reefs can be beneficial for the restoration of coral populations.

One hypothesis suggests that high N2O emissions may stem from increased denitrification induced by CO2 enhancement of plant carbon (C) allocation belowground. However, direct evidence illustrating linkages among N2O emissions, plant C allocation, and denitrifying microbes under eCO2 is still lacking. We examined the impact of eCO2 on plant C allocation to roots and their associated arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi and its subsequent effects on N2O emissions and denitrifying microbes in the presence of two distinct N sources, ammonium nitrogen (NH4 +-N) and nitrate nitrogen (NO3 --N). Our results showed that the form of the N inputs dominated the effects of eCO2 on N2O emissions: eCO2 significantly increased N2O emissions with NO3 --N inputs but had no effect with NH4 +-N inputs. eCO2 increased plant biomass N more with NH4 +-N than with NO3 --N inputs, likely reducing microbial access to available N under NH4 +-N inputs and/or contributing to higher N2O emissions under NO3 --N inputs. eCO2 enhanced root and mycorrhizal N uptake and also increased N2O emissions under NO3 --N inputs. Further, eCO2 enhancement of N2O emissions under NO3 --N inputs concurred with a shift in the soil denitrifier community composition in favor of N2O-producing (nirK- and nirS-type) over N2O-consuming (nosZ-type) denitrifiers. Together, these results indicate that eCO2 stimulated N2O emissions mainly through altering plant N preference in favor of NH4 + over NO3 - and thus stimulating soil denitrifiers and their activities. These findings suggest that effective management of N sources may mitigate N2O emissions by negating the eCO2 stimulation of soil denitrifying microbes and their activities. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Bacteria; Carbon dioxide; Fungi; Soils; Ammonium nitrogen; Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi; Community composition; Denitrifiers; Effective management; N uptakes; Nitrate nitrogen; Plant biomass; Denitrification; ammonia; carbon dioxide; nitrate; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; carbon dioxide; chemical composition; denitrification; emission; nitrous oxide; Article; biomass production; controlled study; denitrifyer; fungal colonization; microbial activity; microbial gene; mycorrhiza; nonhuman; plant; plant growth; shoot; soil acidity; soil analysis; soil microflora; species composition; denitrification; microbiology; soil; Fungi; Carbon Dioxide; Denitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072791367

The accurate calculation of IES power flow helps to meet the demand of users better and quantify the flexibility of IES for accommodating more renewables. However, modeling and calculating the power flow of IES become challenging because of the DERs and the different characteristics of electricity and heat such as system dynamic process, network topology and control mechanism. To overcome the challenges in existing IES model, this paper proposes a generalized quasi-dynamic model and a decomposition-iteration solving method for the electric-heat coupling IES, which considers the heat dynamic process, meshed network topology, multiple DERs and variable mass flow simultaneously. From the results of case studies, the proposed IES model has the average error of 0.09% compared with real measured data and surpasses commercial software in terms of pipe temperature dynamics, which demonstrates the accuracy and generality of the proposed model.

HMAwith a high content of reclaimed asphalt (RA) (e.g., 40%) is sometimes used in practice, however, it may have significant adverse effects on the life cycle performance and related costs. In particular, challenges may arise as the life cycle performance of RAP is also affected by local climatic conditions. Thus, it is important to investigate whether it is still economic to use RAP under future local climate, with consideration of life cycle performance. a case study was conducted for various road structures on Interstate 95 (I-95) in New Hampshire (NH), USA for the investigation. The case study utilized dynamic modulus testing results for local virgin HMA and HMA with 40% RA (as major material alternatives) to predict life cycle performance of the selected pavement structures, considering downscaled future climates. Then, a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA) was considered to estimate and compare the life cycle cash flow of the investigated road structures. Responsive maintenance (overlay) and effectiveness were also considered in this study. It was found that using 40% RA in HMA can reduce agency costs by up to approximately 18% under the 2020-2040 predicted climate and NH should consider this practice under predicted future climate to reduce agency costs. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate downscaling; Life cycle cost; Performance; Reclaimed asphalt pavement; Recycling","climate change; climate conditions; cost analysis; environmental economics; future prospect; pavement; recycling; New Hampshire; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073436744

As most air quality monitoring stations are located in urban areas, we simulated the PM2.5 (i.e., particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter &lt; 2.5 µm) and ozone (O3) in the entire SCB during winter (December 2014–February 2015) and summer (June–August 2015) by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) models. The simulated concentrations of 24-h PM2.5 and its major components generally agree with observations during both seasons, but the simulated 1-h and 8-h O3 are acceptable only for summer. Increasing in severity from the rim of the SCB to its inner areas, the PM2.5, as well as its major components, exhibits hotspots near the central urban areas of Chongqing and Chengdu, with concentrations of 150–200 µg m–3 and 40–60 µg m–3 during winter and summer, respectively. The 1-h and 8-h O3 exhibit no hotspots in the urban centers of Chongqing and Chengdu but show elevated levels in some rural and suburban areas (55–70 ppb and 65–80 ppb, respectively), including those on the western and southwestern rim of the SCB, and downwind of the urban center of Chongqing. Despite the great spatial variations in the PM2.5 and O3 concentrations, the vast majority of the basin fails to meet the WHO guidelines for 24-h PM2.5 (25 µg m–3) and 8-h O3 (~47 ppb) on &gt; 70% of the days during winter and &gt; 40% of the days during summer, respectively.

Field measurements of gaseous and particulate carbonyls were taken over urban Beijing during summer and winter, and field-measured gas-particle partitioning coefficients (Kp) were determined. Compared with theoretical values, field-measured Kp values were 4–6 orders of magnitude higher for the six detected carbonyls, which underlined the importance of heterogeneous reactions. In winter, the Kp values of carbonyl compounds were one order of magnitude higher than those in summer owing to the effect of temperature. This study applied the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model to the source apportionment of carbonyl compounds. Five factors were identified for both summer and winter, whereas the biogenic factor was only identified in summer and coal burning was only found in winter. In summer, secondary formation was the largest contributor (39%) to the measured total carbonyl compounds levels. In contrast, vehicular exhaust was the largest source of the measured total carbonyl compounds in winter (37%), although secondary formation still had an important contribution of 31%. The contribution of coal burning to ambient carbonyls was reduced by half compared with prior results. As the most abundant carbonyl compound in the atmosphere, formaldehyde in summer mainly came from secondary production (42%) and primary anthropogenic emissions (48%), while biogenic sources had a minor contribution (10%). However, 78% of formaldehyde was attributed to primary anthropogenic emissions in winter, which indicated that these winter emissions were more important sources of carbonyl compounds. Glyoxal was always dominated by secondary formation, with contributions of 56% in summer and 52% in winter. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbonyl compounds; Gas-particle partitioning coefficient; Source apportionment","Carbonyl compounds; Factorization; Anthropogenic emissions; Atmospheric photochemistry; Effect of temperature; Gas-particle partitioning; Heterogeneous reactions; Positive matrix factorization models; Secondary organic aerosols; Source apportionment; Formaldehyde; acetaldehyde; acetone; acetylene; benzaldehyde; butyraldehyde; carbonyl derivative; coal; ethylene; formaldehyde; glyoxal; methylglyoxal; monomer; oligomer; ozone; propionaldehyde; aerosol; anthropogenic source; biogenic emission; carbonyl compound; chemical compound; photochemistry; seasonal variation; secondary production; source apportionment; summer; winter; air pollution control; Article; atmosphere; chemical structure; China; comparative study; controlled study; evaporation; heating; light intensity; low temperature; molecular weight; oxidation; polymerization; priority journal; quantitative analysis; seasonal variation; summer; vapor pressure; winter; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069629870

Due to the large number of cars, the pollution problem is a significant issue for any major city in the world. The importance of this work is to find ways to reduce pollution in a locality without affecting human lifestyle. Certainly, the number of cars involved in road traffic will be approximatively constant but controlling the flow of traffic to minimize the pollution in some specific areas by offering alternative routes is a way to reduce emissions. This is necessary because of the fact that the industry of electric cars building is not yet well developed to provide an alternative to fossil fuel-burning machines. The idea of controlling road traffic according to the number of vehicles is already present in the literature but this paper offers the possibility of testing the possible algorithms underlying road traffic control, namely algorithms based on the level of pollution at intersections in a locality. This paper also provides a solution to the fluidization of traffic, taking into account that an intersection or crowded streets in a locality involves a higher level of pollution than normal. This paper presents a simulation of road traffic management based on the measurement of greenhouse gases through a software application, a database and algorithms.

In a sandy, mixed-grass prairie in the southern Great Plains, we used clipping and NPK fertilization to manipulate plant biomass, habitat heterogeneity, and plant quality to quantify their relative effects on the abundance and diversity of its arthropod community. Both clipping and fertilization treatments affected plant biomass and microclimate, including light availability, temperature, and humidity. By decreasing plant biomass, clipping simplified habitat structure and resulted in reduced arthropod abundance and diversity and increased arthropod activity. This reduction appeared to be mediated by fertilizer addition, which increased total plot carbon, plant biomass, and habitat volume, resulting in lower average surface temperature and higher average humidity. By itself, increasing plant biomass through fertilization increased arthropod abundance, activity, and richness. In addition, we show that changing microclimate and plant biomass promoted shifts in arthropod community composition.

A preliminary aspect of such design endeavors is the acquisition of accurate knowledge regarding the climatic conditions in each region of the studied territory. The objective of this paper is to propose a climatic zoning for Madagascar from a database of 47 meteorological stations by performing hierarchical clustering on principal components (HCPC). The results are then combined with spatial interpolation using geographic information system (GIS) tools, enabling us to define three climate zones corresponding to dry, humid and highland areas. These results make it possible to define standard meteorological files to evaluate the thermal performance of traditional Malagasy houses. Regardless of the type of house and the areas considered, the percentage of thermal comfort according to the Givoni bioclimatic chart varies from average values of 20% without ventilation to 70% with an air velocity of 1 m/s. In summary, Madagascar's traditional habitat typologies have adapted over time to the constraints of their environment. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","climatic zoning; Clustering; GIS; Madagascar; Multivariate analysis; Thermal comfort","Air; Energy utilization; Houses; Information use; Multivariant analysis; Principal component analysis; Thermal comfort; Zoning; Clustering; Hier-archical clustering; Madagascar; Meteorological station; Multi variate analysis; Principal Components; Spatial interpolation; Tropical environments; Geographic information systems; architectural design; climate conditions; cluster analysis; GIS; multivariate analysis; principal component analysis; ventilation; Madagascar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070915673

Government and other forest stakeholders in Nepal are, however, still reluctant to promote active management of production forests for fear of negative impacts on forest biodiversity. Moreover, Nepal's government is converting production forests into protected areas thus restricting the area available for multiple uses. To assess the implications of forest management practices on forest biodiversity at landscape level, we compared the richness and composition of tree species among regularly harvested community forests, irregularly harvested community forests, protected area and national forests in sub-tropical forested landscape of Nepal using tree species inventory and assessment of key environmental variables. Results showed that regularly harvested community forests could be effective in supporting tree species richness and composition compared to other management regimes. Results supported the hypothesis that high forest disturbance and no disturbance do not support tree species diversity and composition. In addition, this study found that regularly managed community forests also protect ecologically important and vulnerable tree species. Some possible explanations for the better performance of these community forests could be tenure security, frequency and regularity of silvicultural operations and sensitivity of forest users to the ecological aspects of forest management. Our study reaffirmed the need for active forest management at the local level to contribute to global conservation initiatives such as sustainable forest management, reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries (REDD+) and biodiversity conservation. Better compliance with forest management plans and capacity development of local forestry stakeholders in forest management operations are suggested for managing forests outside protected areas that is, in national and community forests. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Forest biodiversity; Forest harvesting; Importance value index; Intermediate disturbance hypothesis; REDD+; Species composition; Sustainable forest management","biodiversity; community composition; conservation; deforestation; emission control; forest management; harvesting; species richness; sustainable forestry; Nepal; Tarai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071631932

They are usually used to replace fully-fledged Chemical Transport models (CTMs) when simulating a huge number of emission reduction scenarios, in policy-related contexts. Even if SRRs do not contain the same richness of information as CTMs (i.e. in terms of spatial/temporal resolution) and are merely a statistical approximation of the original models, their application is usually deemed to be sufficient in the policy arena, when a condensed (i.e. yearly average concentrations instead of hourly detailed ones) representation of the real scenarios is required; and when “simulation time” is a constraint (as i.e. optimization processes). In this paper we identify and validate SRRs, based on the EMEP MSC-W Chemical Transport Model. The proposed statistical SRR approach is implemented using a limited number of CTM simulations. Also, it allows for a flexible selection of the emission reduction scenarios to be simulated, both from a geographical and a sectoral point of view. The validation results, performed on various domains and sectors, demonstrate that the proposed methodology can be used in a policy context, even if certain limitations on its use needs to be recognized. © 2019","Air quality model; Emission reduction scenarios; Integrated assessment modelling; Source receptor relationships","Air quality standards; Emission control; Air quality modeling; Average concentration; Chemical transport models; Emission reduction; Integrated assessment modelling; Source-receptor relationships; Statistical approximation; Validation results; Air quality; air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; emission control; optimization; pollutant transport; air quality; Article; comparative study; controlled study; dry deposition; environmental policy; geographically weighted regression; greenhouse gas; grid cell; molecular dynamics; priority journal; uncertainty; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072582264

However, excess light can be harmful for the photosynthetic apparatus because it produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) that cause photoinhibition. Oxygenic organisms evolved photoprotection mechanisms to counteract light-dependent ROS production, including preventive dissipation of excited states of chlorophyll (1Chl∗) into heat in the process termed non-photochemical quenching (NPQ). This consists in the activation of 1Chl∗ quenching reactions when the thylakoid luminal pH drops below 5.2. In turn, acidification occurs when the rate of the CO2 reducing cycle is saturated and cannot regenerate ADP+Pi, thus inhibiting ATPase activity and the return of protons (H+) to the stromal compartment. The major and fastest component of NPQ is energy quenching, qE, which in algae depends on the Light-Harvesting Complex Stress-Related (LHCSR) proteins. In mosses, LHCSR proteins have remained the major catalysts of energy dissipation, but a minor contribution also occurs via a homologous protein, Photosystem II Subunit S (PSBS). In vascular plants, however, LHCSR has disappeared and PSBS is the only pH-sensitive trigger of qE. Why did PSBS replace LHCSR in the later stages of land colonization Both PSBS and LHCSR belong to the Light Harvesting Complex superfamily (LHC) and share properties such as harboring protonatable residues that are exposed to the chloroplast lumen, which is essential for pH sensing. However, there are also conspicuous differences: LHCSR binds chlorophylls and xanthophylls while PSBS does not, implying that the former may well catalyse quenching reactions while the latter needs pigment-binding partners for its quenching function. Here, the evolution of quenching mechanisms for excess light is reviewed with a focus on the role of LHCSR versus PSBS, and the reasons for the redundancy of LHCSR in vascular plants as PSBS became established. © 2019 The Author(s).

It is imperative for us to limit green house gas emissions in order to combat rising global average temperatures. One way to move forward is the integration of renewable energy resources on all levels of the power system, i.e. from large-scale energy producers to individual households. The future smart grid provides the technology for this. In this paper, a novel demand-side management concept is proposed. It is implemented by a utility company which focuses on renewable energy. Through a specific billing mechanism, prosumers are encouraged to balance load and supply. A game-theoretic approach models households as self-determined rational energy users, that want to reduce their individual electricity costs. To achieve this, they selfishly share energy with their neighbours and also schedule their energy storage systems. The scheme is designed such that monetary transactions between households are not necessary. Thus, it provides an alternative approach to energy trading schemes from the literature. © 2019 IEEE.","Battery Scheduling; Energy Sharing; Game Theory; Prosumer; Smart Grid","Computation theory; Costs; Demand side management; Electric energy storage; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Game theory; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Renewable energy resources; Electricity costs; Energy sharings; Energy storage systems; Integration of renewable energies; Prosumer; Renewable energies; Smart grid; Utility companies; Smart power grids",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076400064

One of the methods widely and most often used for this purpose is dynamical downscaling. In the present paper we examine the ability of a specific global (HadGEM2-ES) and a specific regional climate model (RegCM) to describe present climatic conditions in different geographical areas within the Med-CORDEX domain. Our main goal with this validation is to inform researchers, who are planning to complete climate change impact studies about the major characteristics of the simulation outputs, serving as important input in such studies. So we analyzed annual and seasonal mean fields, mean error fields relative to the reference measurements, and selected climate indices. On the basis of the results, dynamical downscaling generally cools the HadGEM results, which depends on the distance from the ocean, and orography. A clear improvement can be recognized in the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of temperature indices when using finer resolution. Moreover, dynamical downscaling with higher resolution often increases the precipitation in mountains. Furthermore, in order to quantify the potential added value of RegCM simulations, a complex measure was introduced to take into account both the magnitude and spatial extent of bias. The analysis shows a general improvement in the cold-related indices in Central Europe and all temperature-related climate indices in Western Europe. The influence of model resolution is usually so strong, that it results in the underestimation of precipitation indices changing into overestimation and vice versa. © 2019, Hungarian Meteorological Service.

The carbon cycle is a key process of terrestrial ecosystem changes. Therefore, a better understanding and assessment of the impacts of climate extremes on the terrestrial carbon cycle could provide an important scientific basis to facilitate the mitigation and adaption of our society to climate change. In this paper, we systematically review the impacts of climate extremes (e.g. drought, extreme precipitation, extreme hot and extreme cold) on terrestrial ecosystems and their mechanisms. Existing studies have suggested that drought is one of the most important stressors on the terrestrial carbon sink, and that it can inhibit both ecosystem productivity and respiration. Because ecosystem productivity is usually more sensitive to drought than respiration, drought can significantly reduce the strength of terrestrial ecosystem carbon sinks and even turn them into carbon sources. Large inter-model variations have been found in the simulations of drought-induced changes in the carbon cycle, suggesting the existence of a large gap in current understanding of the mechanisms behind the responses of ecosystem carbon balance to drought, especially for tropical vegetation. The effects of extreme precipitation on the carbon cycle vary across different regions. In general, extreme precipitation enhances carbon accumulation in arid ecosystems, but restrains carbon sequestration in moist ecosystems. However, current knowledge on the indirect effects of extreme precipitation on the carbon cycle through regulating processes such as soil carbon lateral transportation and nutrient loss is still limited. This knowledge gap has caused large uncertainties in assessing the total carbon cycle impact of extreme precipitation. Extreme hot and extreme cold can affect the terrestrial carbon cycle through various ecosystem processes. Note that the severity of such climate extremes depends greatly on their timing, which needs to be investigated thoroughly in future studies. In light of current knowledge and gaps in the understanding of how extreme climates affect the terrestrial carbon cycle, we strongly recommend that future studies should place more attention on the long-term impacts and on the driving mechanisms at different time scales. Studies based on multi-source data, methods and across multiple spatial-temporal scales, are also necessary to better characterize the response of terrestrial ecosystems to climate extremes. © 2019, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon cycle; Carbon sink; Climate extremes; Vegetation productivity","Carbon; Climate change; Drought; Productivity; Uncertainty analysis; Vegetation; Carbon cycles; Carbon sink; Climate extremes; Ecosystem productivity; Lateral transportation; Terrestrial carbon cycle; Terrestrial ecosystems; Vegetation productivity; Ecosystems; carbon cycle; carbon sink; climate change; ecosystem function; extreme event; literature review; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation dynamics",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067021240

As a climate-sensitive perennial crop, coffee is likely to be highly susceptible to changes in climate. Using a systematic approach, we explore evidence from the published academic literature of the influence of climate change and variability, specifically drought, on coffee production. A number of mostly negative impacts were reported in the current literature, including declines in coffee yield, loss of coffee-optimal areas with significant impacts on major global coffee-producing countries and growth in the distribution of pest and disease that indirectly influence coffee cultivation. Current research also identified positive effects of climate change such as increases in coffee-producing niche, particularly in areas at higher altitudes; however, whether these gains might offset losses from other production areas requires further investigation. Other advantages include increases in pollination services and the beneficial effects of elevated carbon concentration, leading to potential yield improvements. Future priorities should focus on major coffee-growing regions projected to be adversely affected by climate change, with specific attention given to potential adaptation strategies tailored to particular farming conditions such as relocation of coffee plantations to more climatically suitable areas, irrigation and agroforestry. The majority of studies were based in the Americas and concentrated on Arabica coffee. A broader spread of research is therefore required, especially for the large growing regions in Asia and for Robusta coffee, to support sustainable production of the global coffee industry. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Cultivation; Academic literature; Adaptation strategies; Beneficial effects; Carbon concentrations; Coffee plantation; Sustainable production; Systematic Review; Yield Improvement; Climate change; adaptive management; agroforestry; climate change; climate effect; coffee; crop production; crop yield; literature review; livelihood; smallholder; Asia; Coffea arabica; Coffea canephora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072217413

This unique physiology forges an important link between the marine silicon and carbon cycles. However, the effect of ocean acidification on the silicification of diatoms is unclear. Here we show that diatom silicification strongly diminishes with increased acidity in a natural Antarctic community. Analyses of single cells from within the community reveal that the effect of reduced pH on silicification differs among taxa, with several species having significantly reduced silica incorporation at CO2 levels equivalent to those projected for 2100. These findings suggest that, before the end of this century, ocean acidification may influence the carbon and silicon cycle by both altering the composition of the diatom assemblages and reducing cell ballasting, which will probably alter vertical flux of these elements to the deep ocean. © 2019, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"algal bloom; carbon cycle; deep-sea benthos; ocean acidification; pH; physiology; silicification; silicon; Bacillariophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071516832

While mycoheterotroph plastomes are often degraded compared with green plants, the effect of this unusual symbiosis on mitochondrial genome evolution is unknown. By providing the first complete organelle genome data from Polygalaceae, one of only three eudicot families that developed mycoheterotrophy, we explore how both organellar genomes evolved after loss of photosynthesis. Methods We sequenced and assembled four complete plastid genomes and a mitochondrial genome from species of Polygalaceae, focusing on non-photosynthetic Epirixanthes. We compared these genomes with those of other mycoheterotroph and parasitic plant lineages, and assessed whether organelle genes in Epirixanthes experienced relaxed or intensified selection compared with autotrophic relatives. Key Results Plastomes of two species of Epirixanthes have become substantially degraded compared with that of autotrophic Polygala. Although the lack of photosynthesis is presumably homologous in the genus, the surveyed Epirixanthes species have marked differences in terms of plastome size, structural rearrangements, gene content and substitution rates. Remarkably, both apparently replaced a canonical plastid inverted repeat with large directly repeated sequences. The mitogenome of E. elongata incorporated a considerable number of fossilized plastid genes, by intracellular transfer from an ancestor with a less degraded plastome. Both plastid and mitochondrial genes in E. elongata have increased substitution rates, but the plastid genes of E. pallida do not. Despite this, both species have similar selection patterns operating on plastid housekeeping genes. Conclusions Plastome evolution largely fits with patterns of gene degradation seen in other heterotrophic plants, but includes highly unusual directly duplicated regions. The causes of rate elevation in the sequenced Epirixanthes mitogenome and of rate differences in plastomes of related mycoheterotrophic species are not currently understood. © The Author(s) 2019.","Epirixanthes; Gene loss; Mitochondrial genome; Mycoheterotrophy; Parasitic plants; Plastome evolution; Polygalaceae; Rearrangements; Selective pressure","angiosperm; evolution; gene; gene expression; genome; heterotrophy; parasitic plant; plastid; Fungi; Magnoliophyta; Polygala; Polygalaceae; Viridiplantae; angiosperm; heterotrophy; mitochondrial genome; molecular evolution; phylogeny; plastid genome; Polygalaceae; Evolution, Molecular; Genome, Mitochondrial; Genome, Plastid; Heterotrophic Processes; Magnoliopsida; Phylogeny; Polygalaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075814190

The purpose of the present paper is to validate the efficacy of the stability charts through the application to several case studies of underground cavities, considering both quarries collapsed in the past and quarries still stable. The stability graphs proposed by Perrotti et al. (2018) can be useful to evaluate, in a preliminary way, a safety margin for cavities that have not reached failure and to detect indications of predisposition to local or general instability phenomena. Alternatively, for sinkholes that already occurred, the graphs may be useful in identifying the conditions that led to the collapse, highlighting the importance of some structural elements (as pillars and internal walls) on the overall stability of the quarry system. © Author(s) 2019.",,"carbonate rock; collapse; finite element method; geometry; mechanical property; quarry; sinkhole; soft rock; stability analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073069995

The research here presented aimed at enriching a methanotrophic consortium from two different inocula (Sphagnum peat moss (Sp) and Sphagnum and activated sludge (M)) able to accumulate PHA while efficiently oxidizing CH4. Moreover, the effect of the temperature and phosphorus limitation on the biodegradation rate of CH4 and the PHA accumulation potential was investigated. Higher CH4 degradation rates were obtained under P availability at increasing temperature (25, 30 and 37 °C). The biomass enriched from the mixed inoculum always exhibited a superior biodegradation performance regardless of the temperature (a maximum value of 84.3 ± 8.4 mg CH4 h−1 g biomass−1 was recorded at 37 °C). The results of the PHB production showed that phosphorus limitation is required to promote PHB accumulation, the highest PHB content being observed with the Sphagnum inoculum at 25 °C (13.6 ± 5.6%). The differential specialization of the microbial communities depending on the enrichment temperature supported the key role of this parameter on the results obtained. In all cases after the completion of the enrichment process and of the P limitation tests, Methylocystis, a type II methanotroph known for its ability to accumulate PHA, was the genus that became dominant (reaching percentages from 16 to 46% depending on the enrichment temperature). Thus, the results here obtained demonstrated for the first time the relevance of the temperature used for the enrichment of the methanotrophic bacteria to boost PHA production yields under P limiting condition, highlighting the importance of optimizing culture conditions to improve the cost-efficiency of bioprocesses based on using methane as the primary feedstock for the PHA industrial market. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Greenhouse gases mitigation; Methane abatement; Methanotrophs; Phosphorus limitation; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Sphagnum mosses","Biodegradation; Commerce; Degradation; Greenhouse gases; Phosphorus; Temperature; Biodegradation performance; Effect of temperature; Increasing temperatures; Methanotrophic bacteria; Methanotrophs; Phosphorus limitation; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Sphagnum mosses; Methane; methane; phosphorus; poly(3 hydroxybutyric acid); polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; methane; phosphorus; polyhydroxyalkanoic acid; emission; greenhouse gas; methane; methanotrophy; microbial community; moss; nutrient limitation; phosphorus; polymer; temperature effect; activated sludge; Article; biodegradation; biomass distribution; carbon footprint; cost effectiveness analysis; high temperature; inoculation; methanotroph; methylocystis; microbial community; nonhuman; oxidation; priority journal; Sphagnum; temperature sensitivity; bioremediation; metabolism; Sphagnopsida; temperature; Bryophyta; Methylocystis; Sphagnum; Biodegradation, Environmental; Methane; Phosphorus; Polyhydroxyalkanoates; Sphagnopsida; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067863061

Among the many forms of DRT services, demand responsive bus (DRB) services are gaining traction as a complimentary mode to existing public transit services, especially to dynamically bridge the first/last mile connectivity. Simultaneously, the stern regulations imposed by regulators on greenhouse gas emission have enforced electric vehicles (EV) to replace conventional vehicles. However, state-of-the-art (SoA) work proposed to generate routes for EV-based DRB services are inhibited by the low number of ride matches and the excessively high computation time of the algorithms deeming them unsuitable for real-time computations. To this end, we propose a genetic algorithm for dynamic scheduling of EV in a DRB service that reacts to first mile ride requests of passengers. In addition, we also formulate an optimal mixed integer program to generate baseline results. Experiments on an actual road network show that the proposed GA generates significantly accurate results compared to the baseline in real-time. Further, we analyze the benefits of rescheduling passengers and flexible estimated time of arrival of EV to optimize the total travel time of passengers. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Genetic algorithms; Greenhouse gases; Integer programming; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Scheduling; Traffic control; Travel time; Baseline results; Computation time; Dynamic scheduling; Estimated time of arrivals; Information and Communication Technologies; Mixed-integer programs; Real-time computations; State of the art; Scheduling algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076800031

The concentration of people in urban areas makes these increasingly requiring for primary products and services as food and energy, and the fulfilment of such needs result in significant carbon emissions. The inclusion of spatial functions as agriculture and renewables in the urban planning can address to this environmental impact, but would require support-planning tools able to explore new land-use allocation strategies within an integrated urban-rural ecosystem. In this paper, we propose an optimization framework for the planning of low carbon urban-rural ecosystems that integrates transport and land-use planning and cope with urban metabolism, involving urban mobility, food transportation, energy supplies. This framework contributes to the literature as it formulates a network between urban, agricultural, energy, and carbon mitigation land-covers and optimizes the horizontal carbon fluxes within an integrated urban-rural environment. In order to minimize carbon emissions by mobility and resources (i.e. food) transportation, the framework aids identifying trade-offs between accessibility and density over the spatial distribution of resource-generating and resource-consuming land-covers. Proof of concept is provided with a realistic numerical example, propelled by real-world data from an Italian region. The land-use allocation solution makes the exemplifying urban-rural ecosystem behaving as carbon sink due to the established green areas and the configuration of the spatial uses. A sensitivity analysis is finally carried out to assess the impacts of mobility and resources transportation on the spatial urban-rural structure and associated carbon emissions. It comes out that the optimal urban configuration to mitigate carbon emissions from transportation integrates urban and rural uses and guarantees accessibility to several functions as cultivated areas, renewables and green covers, responsible to provide food, energy and air cleaning respectively to dwellers. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Energy; Food; Land-use; Spatial-planning; Transportation; Urban logistics","Agriculture; Air cleaners; Carbon; Economic and social effects; Ecosystems; Environmental impact; Food products; Land use; Metabolism; Motor transportation; Rural areas; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Transportation; Urban planning; Energy; Environmental sustainability; Integrated transport; Optimization framework; Spatial planning; Transport and land use; Urban configurations; Urban logistics; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068241847

Literature suggests forest carbon sequestration (FCS) is a good alternative to mitigate climate change due to its ability to sequester carbon at low cost. Nevertheless, FCS subsidies have not been addressed together with impacts on food security and climate change reduced crop yields. In our multidisciplinary work, we collected the crop yield shocks from global circulation—crop modeling. We also developed a new version of a computable general equilibrium model for the economic analysis. Thus, we evaluate the global economic impacts of using carbon taxes and FCS to achieve 50% emission reductions. We find that implementing an aggressive FCS incentive can cause substantial increases in food prices because of land competition between forest and crop production. Without climate induced yield reductions, FCS is attractive, but not with the yield reductions. With the climate induced yield shocks, food price increases are huge—so large that it is clear this approach could not be adopted in the real world. The results cry out for investment in agricultural research on climate adaptation. Our findings suggest economic well-being falls more without mitigation than with 50% emission reductions. © 2019, The Author(s).","Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Crop yield; Food security; Forestry; General equilibrium; Mitigation methods","Carbon; Costs; Crops; Cultivation; Economic analysis; Emission control; Food supply; Forestry; Timber; Carbon sequestration; Crop yield; Food security; General equilibrium; Mitigation methods; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063187821

Earth-abundant and nonprecious metals are, here, of interest as a replacement for scarce and expensive platinum group catalysts. Ni-Mo is a promising alternative to Pt, but the type of the substrate could ultimately affect both the initial growth conditions and the final charge transfer in the system as a whole with resistive junctions formed in the heterojunction interface. In this study, we investigated the effect of different substrates on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) of Ni-Mo electrocatalysts. Ni-Mo catalysts (30 atom % Ni, 70 atom % Mo) were sputtered on various substrates with different porosities and conductivities. There was no apparent morphological difference at the surface of the catalytic films sputtered on the different substrates, and the substrates were classified from microporous to flat. The electrochemical characterization was carried out with linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) in the frequency range 0.7 Hz-100 kHz. LSV measurements were carried out at direct current (DC) potentials between 200 and -400 mV vs the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) in 1 M NaOH encompassing the HER. The lowest overpotentials for HER were obtained for films on the nickel foam at all current densities (-157 mV vs RHE @ 10 mA cm-2), and the overpotentials increased in the order of nickel foil, carbon cloth, fluorine-doped tin oxide, and indium tin oxide glass. EIS data were fitted with two equivalent circuit models and compared for different DC potentials and different substrate morphologies and conductivities. By critical evaluation of the data from the models, the influence of the substrates on the reaction kinetics was analyzed in the high- and low-frequency regions. In the high-frequency region, a strong substrate dependence was seen and interpreted with a Schottky-type barrier, which can be rationalized as being due to a potential barrier in the material heterojunctions or a resistive substrate-film oxide/hydroxide. The results highlight the importance of substrates, the total charge transfer properties in electrocatalysis, and the relevance of different circuit components in EIS and underpin the necessity to incorporate high-conductivity, chemically inert, and work-function-matched substrate-catalysts in the catalyst system. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Binary alloys; Carbon; Carbon films; Charge transfer; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Equivalent circuits; Foams; Heterojunctions; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; ITO glass; Molybdenum alloys; Nanocomposites; Nickel alloys; Platinum alloys; Reaction kinetics; Sodium hydroxide; Solar power generation; Spectroscopy; Tin oxides; Electrochemical characterizations; Equivalent circuit model; Fluorine doped tin oxide; Heterojunction interfaces; Hydrogen evolution reactions; Impedance spectroscopy modeling; Linear sweep voltammetry; Reversible hydrogen electrodes; Substrates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072923186

Supercritical CO2 with O2 and SO2 impurities (0.16 and 2% respectively) was reacted with core from the Precipice Sandstone, Evergreen Formation, and Hutton Sandstone of the Surat Basin, Australia. The Precipice Sandstone is a low salinity target reservoir for CO2 storage, where the Evergreen Formation would be the overlying cap-rock, and the Hutton Sandstone is an overlying aquifer. High and low water regimes were investigated with core sections either submerged in bulk gas saturated water, or suspended in the water saturated supercritical gas head at reservoir in situ conditions of 60 °C and 12 MPa. During O2–SO2–CO2 water rock reactions in bulk solution, a low solution pH (~1–2) was measured owing to the relatively high gas impurity concentrations used. Dissolution of reactive minerals from the core including Fe-chlorite, ankerite, siderite, and plagioclase was directly observed. The Evergreen Formation cap-rock and Hutton Sandstone cores reacted here contained ~ 5–10 times higher total concentrations of elements such as Fe, Al, Ti, Ba than the Precipice Sandstone core. Several cations were mobilised to solution including Mn, Co, Zn, Sr, Si, and Mg. Increasing dissolved concentrations of Mn, and Co were strongly correlated with Fe (R2 = 0.99) during reaction of the Precipice Sandstone core. Dissolved Co and Sr were strongly correlated with Fe during reaction of the Evergreen Formation core. Dissolved Mn was somewhat correlated with Fe (R2 = 0.99) from reaction of the Hutton Sandstone core, from both carbonate and chlorite dissolution. During gas-water reaction with the Hutton Sandstone core, dissolved element concentrations subsequently decreased, by incorporation into newly formed Fe oxide precipitates observed with Cr and Ni signatures. Geochemical models were built and validated with good agreement attained with experiments, predicting Fe-chlorite and minor carbonate minerals were the main minerals dissolving. Reactive surface areas initially estimated by a modified geometric method needed substantial increases for example in the case of chlorite (up to 2000x), and decreases for carbonates (2–10x) to match experimental data. A 30 year simulation of reservoir rock reactivity showed that the lowered pH was buffered by mineral dissolution. Compared to previously published pure CO2-water-rock reactions, the concentrations of ions such as Si generally were initially higher through reaction of more silicate minerals at the lower generated pH, and the oxidation of sulphides. Compared to SO2–CO2-water reactions, the concentrations of cations were similar, but with O2 present dissolved Fe subsequently decreased as Fe-oxide, sulphate and clay minerals precipitated. Cap-rock showed reactivity to wet supercritical O2–SO2–CO2 fluid in the supercritical gas headspace. Corrosion of minerals including ankerite and Fe-chlorite were observed, along with precipitation of oxide, sulphate and silicate minerals on rock surfaces. These results have implications for impacts in CO2 storage sites where gas impurities may be co-injected with CO2 and accumulate in the near wellbore region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 geosequestration; Evergreen formation; Hutton sandstone; Oxygen and sulphur dioxide impurity; Precipice sandstone","Aquifers; Boreholes; Carbon dioxide; Corrosion; Digital storage; Dissolution; Feldspar; Firing (of materials); Gases; Geochemistry; Iron oxides; Positive ions; Sandstone; Silicates; Sulfur dioxide; Dissolved concentrations; Evergreen formation; Geo sequestrations; Geochemical modelling; Mineral dissolution; Near-wellbore region; Reactive surface area; Water-rock reactions; Cobalt; ankerite; cap rock; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbonate sediment; chlorite; coal; experimental study; geochemical survey; oxidation; plagioclase; precipitation (chemistry); reservoir rock; salinity; sandstone; sulfide; Australia; Surat Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070869463

These regions receive the maximum energy from the Sun, and are highly turbulent and influenced by the processes of the Northern Hemisphere as well as by the Southern Hemisphere. Atmospheric temperature is one the most sensitive parameters and having imprints of dynamical, radiative and chemical processes. Thermal structure, seasonal variability and atmospheric oscillations occurring in the equatorial middle atmosphere have been studied here using temperature profiles retrieved from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using the Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument on-board Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite during January 2002 to December 2015 (14 years). In the present work, three geographical locations over the Equatorial latitudes and ±120° longitude have been chosen, considering 5° × 15° latitude-longitude grid between the altitudes ranging from 20 to 100 km. A detailed time series and climatology analyses have been performed over these regions and significant longitudinal differences have been observed. Characteristics of Semi Annual oscillation (SAO), Annual Oscillation (AO) and Quasi Biennial Oscillation (QBO) have been investigated using Lomb Scargle Periodogram and wavelet transform analysis techniques. It has been noted the longitudinal differences in the spectral amplitudes of equatorial oscillations relative to the zonal mean spectrum. The longitudinal asymmetry might be due to the vertically propagating planetary waves. From the analysis, it is also observed that SAO is showing the highest amplitude at 45 km and 75–85 km, and QBO is showing significant amplitude in the lower stratosphere. At higher altitudes, amplitudes of different oscillations (viz. SAO, AO, and QBO) are very weak, and temperatures variations are not revealing any significant pattern. Moreover, from the climatology and time series of the temperature measurements, high temperature (∼260 K) has been noticed at 55–65 km height range. In addition to that, seasonal variations over equatorial regions have been studied and the strength of seasonal differences are found to be about 9 K (summer-winter) at higher altitudes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric oscillations; Climatology; Seasonal variations; Temperature","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric structure; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climatology; Ionosphere; Temperature; Temperature measurement; Time series; Time series analysis; Wavelet transforms; Atmospheric oscillations; Broadband emission radiometry; Geographical locations; Latitude longitude grid; Lomb-scargle periodogram; Quasi-biennial oscillation; Seasonal variation; Thermosphere ionosphere mesosphere energetics and dynamics; Atmospheric temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068264036

This paper presents a novel data-driven approach to strategic planning of building energy retrofitting. The approach is based on the urban building energy model (UBEM), using data about actual building heat energy consumption, energy performance certificates and reference databases. Aggregated projections of the energy performance of each building are used for holistic city-level analysis of retrofitting strategies considering multiple objectives, such as energy saving, emissions reduction and required social investment. The approach is illustrated by the case of Stockholm, where three retrofitting packages (heat recovery ventilation; energy-efficient windows; and a combination of these) were considered for multi-family residential buildings constructed 1946–1975. This identified potential for decreasing heat demand by 334 GWh (18%) and consequent emissions reduction by 19.6 kt-CO2 per year. The proposed method allows the change in total energy demand from large-scale retrofitting to be assessed and explores its impact on the supply side. It thus enables more precisely targeted and better coordinated energy efficiency programmes. The case of Stockholm demonstrates the potential of rich urban energy datasets and data science techniques for better decision making and strategic planning. © 2019 The Authors","Building energy retrofitting; High-resolution metered data; Stockholm; Urban building energy modelling; Urban energy efficiency; Urban energy planning","Artificial intelligence; Buildings; Decision making; Decision support systems; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Global warming; Investments; Retrofitting; Strategic planning; Waste heat; Building energy; High resolution; Stockholm; Urban buildings; Urban energy planning; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067823472

A competition experiment was set up to investigate the effect of warming on plant-plant interactions in semi-dry grasslands. The dominant grass Festuca rupicola and the four rare forbs Biscutella laevigata, Filipendula vulgaris, Scabiosa canescens, and Veronica spicata were placed in pots as monocultures (similar densities), as mixtures (varying densities), and as single individuals. In growth chambers, ambient temperatures (20 °C by day / 10 °C by night) and warmer temperatures predicted under climate change (+3.5 °C) were simulated. After nine months, growth parameters, aboveground biomass and leaf number, and a trait of phenotypic plasticity, leaf length, were measured and plant-plant interactions calculated. Warming significantly increased the growth of the four forbs, while the growth of the grass decreased or remained unchanged. The plant-plant interactions were negative and species-specific, and affected the three parameters differently, with the strongest effect on biomass and the lowest effect on leaf length. In monocultures, the strongest intraspecific competition on biomass was found in the grass. Warming only significantly reduced intraspecific competition on biomass in B. laevigata, but significantly decreased intraspecific competition measured on leaf length for all species. In mixtures with the grass, interspecific competition was the strongest to F. vulgaris and S. canescens, and did not change by warming. Interspecific competition to B. laevigata and V. spicata was reduced by warming. The associated grass was significantly reduced in interspecific competition on biomass in the presence of F. vulgaris and S. canescens by warming. But the grass was unaffected in mixtures with B. laevigata and V. spicata. A temperature increase can led to different patterns in interspecific and intraspecific competition, which suggests that some forbs, like B. laevigata and V. spicata, can benefit from warming but that other species are unaffected. The grass exhibited different responses depending on its heterospecific neighbors. Although the effects of warming and competition are species-specific, warming generally decreased competition. This effect may shape patterns of plant performance and biodiversity in the face of warming in semi-dry grasslands. © 2019 Elsevier GmbH","Growth performance; Interspecific competition; Intraspecific competition; Plant-plant interaction","aboveground biomass; biodiversity; biomass; climate change; grass; grassland; growth; herb; interspecific competition; intraspecific competition; plant community; Biscutella laevigata; Festuca rupicola; Filipendula vulgaris; Scabiosa canescens; Veronica spicata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070743211

Only the enhancements effectively respond to national emission controls. We investigate the temporal evolution and spatial variability in the largest ozone concentrations, i.e., those that define the ozone design value (ODV) upon which the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS) is based, within the northern tier of US states. We focus on two regions: rural western states, with only small anthropogenic precursor emissions, and the urbanized northeastern states, which include the New York City urban area, the nation's most populated. The US background ODV (i.e., the ODV remaining if US anthropogenic precursor emissions were reduced to zero) is estimated to vary from 54 to 63 ppb in the rural western states and to be smaller and nearly constant (45:8±3:0 ppb) throughout the northeastern states. These US background ODVs correspond to 65% to 90% of the 2015 NAAQS of 70 ppb. Over the past 2 to 3 decades US emission control efforts have decreased the US anthropogenic ODV enhancements at an approximately exponential rate, with an e-folding time constant of ∼ 22 years. These ODV enhancements are relatively large in the northeastern US, with state maximum ODV enhancements of ∼ 35-64 ppb in 2000, but are not discernible in the rural western states. The US background ODV contribution is significantly larger than the present-day ODV enhancements due to photochemical production from US anthropogenic precursor emissions in the urban as well as the rural regions investigated. Forward projections of past trends suggest that average maximum ODVs in northeastern US will drop below the NAAQS of 70 ppb by about 2021, assuming that the exponential decrease in the ODV enhancements can be maintained and the US background ODV remains constant. This estimate is much more optimistic than in the Los Angeles urban area, where a similar approach estimates the maximum ODV to reach 70 ppb in ∼ 2050 (Parrish et al., 2017a). The primary reason for this large difference is the significantly higher US ODV background (62:0±2:0 ppb) estimated for the Los Angeles urban area. The approach used in this work has some unquantified uncertainties that are discussed. Models can also estimate US background ODVs; some of those results are shown to correlate with the observationally based estimates derived here (r2 values for different models are ∼ 0:31 to 0.90), but they are on average systematically lower by 4 to 13 ppb. Further model improvement is required until their output can accurately reproduce the time series and spatial variability in observed ODVs. Ideally, the uncertainties in the model and observationally based approaches can then be reduced through additional comparisons. © Author(s) 2019.",,"air quality; ambient air; anthropogenic source; concentration (composition); emission inventory; estimation method; ozone; uncertainty analysis; urban area; California; Los Angeles [California]; New York [New York (STT)]; New York [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073197502

In this study, selective methanogenesis control using the coenzyme M (CoM) and 2-bromoethanesulfonate (2-BES) was investigated in a two-chambered MEC to evaluate the effect of CoM and 2-BES on the production of different electrobiofuels, net energy conversion efficiency and microbial community structure. Because the CoM is a crucial methyl-group carrier in the final process of methanogenesis, it was postulated that CoM would stimulate methanogenic activity at the anode, while a structural analog of the CoM (i.e., 2-BES) was expected to improve cathodic H2 yield using electrons conserved because of methanogen inhibition (electron equivalence: 8 mol e− = 1 mol CH4 = 4 mol H2). CoM injection in MECs significantly enhanced their CH4 production rate, purity, and yield by 4.5-fold, 14.5%, and 76.1%, respectively, compared to the control. Moreover, microbial community analysis indicated that Methanosaeta, the major acetoclastic methanogen, continued to dominate the microbial community but steadily decreased in relative abundance after the CoM injection. On the other hand, drastic increases in hydrogenotrophic methanogens, such as Methanoculleus and Methanolinea, were observed along with potential syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria. In contrast, CH4 production in the 2-BES injected trials was significantly inhibited by 79.5%, resulting in a corresponding increase of H2 production by 145.5% compared to the control. Unlike the CoM, the microbial community did not noticeably change when 2-BES was injected, although the population size gradually decreased over time.

In this sense, a better understanding of the spatial-temporal dynamics of pasture areas is of fundamental importance for a better occupation and territorial governance. Moreover, because they provide different ecosystem services, pastures play a key role in mitigating climate change and in meeting GHG emission reduction targets. Within this context, and based on Landsat image processing via machine learning methods in a cloud computing platform (Google Earth Engine), this work has mapped, annually and in an unprecedented way, the totality of the Brazilian pastures, from 1985 to 2017. With an overall accuracy of about 90%, the 33 maps produced indicated the pasture area varying from ~118 Mha ±3.41% (1985) to ~178 Mha ±2.53% (2017), with this expansion occurring mostly in the northern region of the country and to a lesser extent in the midwest. Temporarily, most of this expansion occurred in the first half of the period evaluated (i.e. between 1985 and 2002), with an increase in Brazilian pasture areas of ~57 mha in just 17 years. After 2002, this area remained relatively stable, varying between ~175 mha ±2.48% and ~178 mha ±2.53% by 2017. In 33 years, about 87% of the mapped areas experienced zero, one, two, or three land-cover / land-use transitions; overall, of the ~178 mha ±2.53% of existing pastures in 2017, ~52 mha are at least 33 years old, ~66 mha were formed after 1985, and ~33 mha may have undergone some reform action in the period under consideration. The dynamics revealed in this study reinforce the thesis of pasture utilization as a land reserve, and demonstrate the importance of these areas in the economic, social, and environmental aspects of Brazil. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Brazilian pasturelands dynamics; Google earth engine; Landsat; Pasture mapping; Random forest","Climate change; Cloud computing; Decision trees; Dynamics; Ecosystems; Emission control; Engines; Greenhouse gases; Image processing; Land use; Learning systems; Cloud computing platforms; Ecosystem services; Environmental aspects; Google earths; High spatial resolution imagery; LANDSAT; Machine learning methods; Random forests; Agriculture; algorithm; assessment method; climate change; ecosystem service; image processing; image resolution; land cover; land use; livestock; machine learning; pasture; spatiotemporal analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068378546

This paper focuses on 100 Resilient Cities (100RC), a transnational municipal network (TMN) that has created governance instruments with potential for contributing to global adaptation governance. Despite their different nature from international actors (states and intergovernmental organizations), the distinct practices of TMNs and how they might influence global adaptation governance are uncertain. Vague claims suggest that TMNs are innovative, but what this innovation consists of remains unclear. Therefore, the research question here is: how do TMNs innovate in global adaptation governance? This paper strives to answer this question, by building an analytical framework to identify types and features of governance instruments, based on the literature on policy instruments, global environmental governance and global climate governance. It presents a case study of 100RC, based on an in-depth documentary analysis and semi-structured interviews. The results suggest that TMNs can be innovative, if they, like 100RC, create original governance instruments instead of using the existing tools of international or other transnational actors. While some of 100RC’s tools favour a more recent, soft and indirect approach, its considerable use of hard practices with significant obligation is particularly interesting considering the general characterization of TMNs as voluntary and soft. The governance practices of 100RC are thus not in stark contrast with those of international actors. Their diversity could provide inspiration for future action to improve the effectiveness of global climate adaptation governance, and the analytical framework developed here could be applied in further studies. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Global adaptation governance; Governance instruments; Innovation; Transnational municipal networks","adaptive management; analytical framework; environmental policy; global climate; global perspective; governance approach; innovation; international agreement",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066473676

In the current paper, the environmental sustainability of a biorefinery system producing ethanol from biowaste is assessed by means of Life Cycle Assessment. It is shown that the biorefinery system presents very good environmental performance, as the net emissions are quite low for all the impact categories examined, while in many of the cases the emissions are negative. The total net global warming impact is estimated to be -15 kg CO2eq/ton biowaste. Following, the environmental impacts from biowaste treatment with the biorefinery system are compared to those from biowaste treatment with the conventional municipal waste management methods. It is shown that the biorefinery system presents very good performance compared to the current waste management methods. Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is conducted for investigating the impact of increased enzyme dosage to the overall environmental performance of the system. It is found that, the increase in ethanol production due to increased enzyme dosage has a smaller impact to the system performance compared to the effect of increased enzyme dosage. Furthermore, it was shown that the range of enzyme contribution in the global warming impact of ethanol biorefineries is wide (11–62%) which is attributed to a number of parameters, such as the high variation of the reported global warming impact of enzymes, the different enzyme loadings and ethanol yields. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biorefinery; Biowaste; Conventional waste management; Enzyme dosage; Ethanol; Life cycle assessment","Bioconversion; Emission control; Environmental management; Enzymes; Ethanol; Global warming; Refining; Sensitivity analysis; Sustainable development; Waste treatment; Bio-waste; Biorefineries; Comparative life cycle assessment; Environmental performance; Environmental sustainability; Enzyme dosage; Global warming impact; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Life cycle; alcohol; biofuel; biomass power; comparative study; ethanol; industrial waste; life cycle analysis; sensitivity analysis; sustainability; waste management; waste treatment; Article; comparative study; conventional waste management; environmental impact; environmental parameters; greenhouse effect; industrial waste; life cycle assessment; municipal waste; waste management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066446596

The intentions towards having a better environment as the economy grows will trigger a shift in the priorities of local government from economy to environment at a certain level of economic development. To investigate the “pollute first, control later” path in China and how environmental regulation performs differently due to economic development, this paper develops a conceptual model to depict the nexus between economic growth and environmental improvement. A panel threshold model is estimated based on Chinese data from different spatial scales – 30 provinces and 105 environmental monitoring cities. The results validate the threshold of economic development of approximately CNY 90,000 GDP per capita, which represents the turning point for the local government priority change; such that only when it is exceeded does environmental regulation significantly reduce emissions. Until 2016, only 4 provincial districts and 35 prefecture-level cities have crossed the threshold, these being mostly in the more prosperous eastern coastal areas. The results emphasize the need to consider timeliness when evaluating the effectiveness of environmental regulation and highlight the importance of adopting differentiated governance. Moreover, the need to enhance the effectiveness of environmental regulation requires driving the change of local government's priority to the environment and strengthening the institutional capacity of environmental protection agencies. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Economic growth; Environmental governance; Environmental regulation; Local government; Threshold effect","conceptual framework; developing world; economic development; economic growth; environmental monitoring; governance approach; Gross Domestic Product; local government; regulatory framework; threshold; trade-off; article; China; city; comparative effectiveness; economic development; environmental monitoring; government; seashore; timeliness; China; developing country; environmental protection; China; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Developing Countries; Economic Development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070610443

This survey highlights the current approaches, relevant methods, technologies and resources adopted for high yield hydrogen production. Prominent thermochemical methods i.e. pyrolysis, gasification, supercritical water gasification, hydrothermal upgrading followed by steam gasification, bio-oil reforming, and pyrolysis inline reforming have been discussed thoroughly in view of the current research trend and latest emerging technologies. Influences of important factors and parameters on hydrogen yield, such as biomass type, temperature, steam to biomass ratio, retention time, biomass particle size, heating rate, etc. have also been extensively studied. Catalyst is a vital integrant that has received enough attention due to its encouraging influence on hydrogen production. Literature confirms that hydrogen obtained from biomass has high-energy efficiency and potential to reduce greenhouse gases hence, it deserves versatile applications in the coming future. The study also reveals that hydrogen production through steam reforming, pyrolysis, and in-line reforming deliver a considerable amount of hydrogen from biomass with higher process efficiency. It has been identified that higher temperature, suitable steam to biomass ratio and catalyst type favor useful hydrogen yield. Nevertheless, hydrogen is not readily available in the sufficient amount and production cost is still high.

The electrification of energy use is growing, while the electricity sector is at the same time undergoing major changes through energy transition, climate change mitigation and sustainable development dynamics. The evolution of the role and the increasing influence of these networks calls for a renewed analysis of their exposure to risks. This paper explores the recent developments of these risks, brought by new hazards and vulnerabilities stemming from recent changes in the environment of the networks. The point here is not to suggest technical resilience prospects, but to explore how the US and the EU have comparatively built a culture around these risks and how they manage them. The paper first analyses the recent evolution of the status of these networks that serve as a base for the entire economy and lifestyles of Western societies. From military objectives in the twentieth century, they have become in the last ten years targets for physical sabotage (at the Metcalf substation powering Silicon Valley in 2013) or cyberattacks (in the Ukraine and Baltic states). This analysis is, secondly, confronted with the new vulnerabilities induced both by the integration of networks on a European scale which produces cascading effects (as in the case of the European blackout of 2006), and by the energy transition that opens networks to digital controls and makes them more vulnerable to cyberattacks. Thirdly, a comparative analysis of the American, European and French responses to these new risks for the networks is proposed. The analysis draws on various field and technical collaborations in the EU and in the US, while most of the technical data stem from incident reports, security guidelines, stress test feedbacks and risk assessments from the network operators. © 2019 Cairn France.

In this study, the phycoremediation of a secondary urban effluent by native microalgae was investigated using a photobioreactor designed to receive carbon dioxide (CO2). The experiments were carried out with and without CO2 addition, and the physicochemical parameters of the effluent were monitored. The biomass yield was determined as the dry weight, and both the lipid and fatty acid profiles were obtained by gas chromatography with mass spectrometry detection. RESULTS: With respect to biomass production, lipid content and phycoremediation of the secondary urban effluent, the best results were observed in the experiments using CO2. In these experiments, reductions of biological oxygen demand (54.34%), total phosphorus (92.4%), ammoniacal nitrogen (97.1%) and total Kjeldahl nitrogen (92.8%) were observed. The CO2 addition also enhanced microalgae growth, as the maximum cell density (MCD) was 54.26% higher after a shorter period of time compared to the MCD obtained without CO2 addition. The biomass yields were 0.5324 ± 0.007 g L−1 and 0.821 ± 0.014 g L−1 without and with CO2 addition, respectively. The lipid yields per unit of biomass for the CO2 supplemented cultures were not statistically different from cultures that were not supplemented with CO2, and the same was observed for fatty acid composition. CONCLUSION: The use of the mixed-type photobioreactor has been shown to be a potential alternative method for biomass production and wastewater phycoremediation. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry","carbon dioxide; fatty acid; hybrid system; microalgae; remediation; urban effluent","Algae; Biochemical oxygen demand; Biomass; Chemical industry; Effluents; Fatty acids; Gas chromatography; Hybrid systems; Mass spectrometry; Microorganisms; Nitrogen; Photobioreactors; Remediation; Wastewater treatment; Biological oxygen demand; Biomass productions; Fatty acid composition; Fatty acid profiles; Micro-algae; Physicochemical parameters; Total Kjeldahl nitrogens; Urban effluents; Carbon dioxide; fatty acid; lipid; nitrogen; phosphorus; polyunsaturated fatty acid; Article; biochemical oxygen demand; biomass production; cell density; cell separation; Chlorella; controlled study; dry weight; fungus growth; gas chromatography; high temperature; light intensity; lipid composition; lipid storage; mass spectrometry; microalga; microbial community; mixotroph; municipal wastewater; nonhuman; Scenedesmus; solar radiation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072139365

Larger granules had multi-layered internal microstructures with higher acetoclastic methanogenic activities (250–437 mL CH4 g−1 VS d−1) than smaller granules (150–260 mL CH4 g−1 VS d−1). The relative abundance of acetoclastic methanogens of larger granules was higher, confirming acetoclastic methane producing pathway was more prominent. However, there was no significant difference in the performance of the two reactors because they were operating below their capacities in terms of organic loading rate to volatile solids ratio. © 2019 The Authors","Anaerobic granules; Methanogenesis; Microbial community; Municipal wastewater; UASB","Methane; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobic granules; Methanogenesis; Microbial communities; Municipal wastewaters; UASB; Granulation; methane; RNA 16S; anoxic conditions; bioreactor; methanogenesis; methanogenic bacterium; microbial activity; microbial community; relative abundance; size distribution; temperature effect; wastewater; wastewater treatment; aerobic granular sludge; anaerobic digestion; anaerobic granular sludge; Article; hydraulic retention time; mesophilic bacterium; methanogenesis; Methanosaeta; Methanosaetaceae; Methanospirillaceae; municipal wastewater; nonhuman; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; sequence analysis; temperature; waste water management; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; sewage; waste water; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Methane; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068510896

It is one of the most serious environmental impacts. Heat can affect human health and lead to additional deaths even under current climatic conditions. Climate projections show a clear change signal for summer heat in the future. This means an increase in hot days and tropical nights, especially in urban quarters without networked green and fresh air corridors. This results in a high need for action with regard to summer heat protection and climate change adaptation measures. This paper makes a contribution to the 11th SDG ""Sustainable Cities and Communities"" with the target to improve the adaptation to climate change and resilience to disasters in terms of summer heat. It deals with the question of how adaptation measures can reduce the burden of summer heat on residents in their homes with the aim to decrease the disaster risk. The paper reviews current knowledge about common adaptation measures, summarizes first results of thermal simulation calculations for the evaluation of effectiveness of adaptation measures, including the effects of residents' behaviour, and makes recommendations for preventive action. The results show that the development of sets of adaptation measures for summer heat waves must not be regarded separate neither from adaptation for cold winter seasons nor from climate protection regarding energy efficiency. Further, it shows the importance of including the aspect of acceptance by the residents in the planning process to make climate change adaptation of their buildings successful. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Disasters; Energy efficiency; Environmental impact; Risk assessment; Adaptation to climate changes; Climate change adaptation; Climate projection; Climate protection; Climatic conditions; Residential areas; Sustainable cities; Thermal simulations; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074651095

Objectives of the study were (1) to extract LULC status and its change between 2006 and 2016; (2) to predict two different LULC scenarios in 2026 and; (3) to assess LULCC impact on ESVs. Herein, Landsat imageries in 2006, 2011 and 2016 were used to classify LULC types by object-based image analysis (OBIA) and the derived results were applied to predict LULC in 2026 of two scenarios by CLUE-S model and to assess the impact of LULCC on ESVs. Results revealed that paddy field and field crop notably decreased while urban and built-up areas and rangeland dramatically increased over the study periods whereas total ESVs declined from about 145 MM USD in 2006 to 132 MM USD in 2026 of Scenario II and the ESVs of three dominant ecosystem service functions (waste treatment, water supply, and climate regulation) continuously decreased. The impact of LULCC on ESVs remarkably differed among the LULC types.

Several epidemiological studies have found a relationship between exposure beyond specified limits and burden of disease [2]. These and many more have led to an increased and urgent need to both monitor and consequently limit personal exposure to harmful pollutants [3]. There is a generalized attention from different governmental agencies globally to limit anthropogenic emissions via legislations and policies. City councils, including for instance in Cambridge, UK, promote new policies that help accelerate switching from combustion engines to electric vehicles both for public and for private transport, accompanied by installation of a distributed urban network of rapid charging points by 2020 [4], along with imposition of road taxes, and exemption from the same based on vehicles' emission of polluting gases and smaller particulate matter (PM2.5). Besides, reduction of indoor wood burning for heating, as one of the largest sources of indoor particulate matter, also has the potential to drastically reduce PM2.5 exposure levels. Citizens are nowadays more conscious of and attentive to their personal exposure to polluting agents and environments and prone to adopt cleaner solutions for living, transport, energy generation and heating. Adoption of personal exposure monitoring devices on an individual level therefore offers multiple benefits and is motivated by the willingness to continue making healthier choices in everyday life consistently. Access to high resolution data of personal exposure with high space and time accuracy is however difficult to achieve with currently available centralized or public network of monitoring stations. Providing individuals with portable devices for air quality monitoring that operate in real time and allow them to monitor and record their personalized exposure levels in combination with conventional geolocation offering a half-meter or less space resolution may become a unique instrument and breakthrough, not only for the individuals, but also for the city councils, and other government agencies to shape and fine-tune their policies for control of air quality in urban, industrial and rural areas. This is possible with the use of both existing and emerging technologies for autonomous sensors, data communication and modern mobile networks, including Internet of Things. © 1998-2012 IEEE.",,"Air quality; Binary alloys; Particles (particulate matter); Potassium alloys; Uranium alloys; Urban transportation; Air quality monitoring; Anthropogenic emissions; Emerging technologies; Epidemiological studies; Governmental agency; High resolution data; Personal exposure monitoring; World Health Organization; Exposure controls",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074066794

This is due to the need for sustainable development which emphasizes on waste reduction, reduction of greenhouse gases (GHG), greener clean environment and conservation of raw resources. This study examines the appropriateness of clay brick waste in powder form as a suitable material for partial substitute of cement in mortar. The clay bricks were obtained as generated waste materials from a brick producing factory in Lagos metropolis and then subjected to grinding. Tests which include; specific gravity, particle size distribution, x-ray fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy were carried out on the pulverized clay brick material (CBP). Further, it is used to partially replace cement in mortar at replacement percentage of 0, 5, 10, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50% using a mix ratio of 1: 2.75 at 0.45 water-cement ratio. Compressive strength and strength activity index tests were carried out on the cube specimens after days of curing. The obtained results clearly indicate that the pulverized clay brick is an amorphous material and contains similar chemical oxide compounds of a pozzolana. Furthermore, it was observed that the compressive strength of the mortar was further improve at an optimum value of 20% cement replacement with clay brick powder compared to the control mortar. Therefore it implies that generated clay brick wastes can be pulverized and used as pozzolanic admixture in mortar production instead of discriminate dumping in landfill. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Amorphous materials; Cement manufacture; Cements; Compressive strength; Greenhouse gases; Mortar; Particle size; Particle size analysis; Scanning electron microscopy; Sustainable development; Cement replacement; Clean environment; Fired clay bricks; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Strength activity index; Sustainable construction; Water-cement ratio; X ray fluorescence; Brick",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075031027

An analysis of the impact of the BC carbon tax is of interest to various stakeholders in the jurisdiction where the tax was implemented. Other Canadian provinces and other countries contemplating a carbon tax policy are looking for insights on how to optimize potential positive and negative consequences. Given that government agri-environmental policies often emphasize farm-level support and environmental performance, there is interest in understanding the farm-level impacts of the carbon tax. The effect of the BC carbon tax on farm income and related production cost variables is investigated. Panel data from 2000 to 2015 are analyzed using both tabular and econometric approaches of the difference-in-difference method. The results indicate that the carbon tax is associated with a decline in net farm income-to-receipts ratios ranging between 8 and 12 cents per dollar of farm receipts. The analysis for costs-to-receipts ratios suggest that the carbon tax is directly related to higher commercial feed costs, farm labour costs, interest costs, and depreciation costs. Results of the regression analysis indicate that all the carbon tax effects are highly statistically significant.

The proposed model is a mixed integer linear program that is solved with AIMMS. The model is solved as a multi-criterion decision making problem, where three objectives (costs, safety, and environmental impact) are balanced. A three dimensional Pareto front is created using the epsilon constraint method. Utopia point analysis is used to make trade-off decisions in the Pareto front.

Despite this potential to increase food security only very few studies have estimated the food production potential of food forests in a temperate climate. In this study the actual food production potential of a 0.08 ha peri-urban food forest in Coldstream, Scotland is determined based on average annual yield records of the 99 species grown in the food forest from 2011–2017, coupled with information about energy and macronutrient content of these species obtained from nutritional databases, research articles and laboratory measurements. The results show that the average annual yield of the 0.08 ha food forest is 713 kg, corresponding to 415,075 kcal, 9868 g protein, 8394 g fat and 85,627 g carbohydrates. Assuming a carbohydrate rich diet where the maximum recommended 60% of energy comes from carbohydrates and the remaining 40% is divided between 25% from fat and 15% from protein, one hectare of food forest with the same species composition as the Garden Cottage food forest would be able to supply up to 7 males or 9 females with carbohydrates, 4 males or 5 females with fat, and 3 males or 4 females with protein. This is somewhat lower than previous assessments and estimates of the food supply capacity of food forests ranging from 6 to 10 people, but since the studied food forest has a relatively low production of protein and fat compared with carbohydrates, this could potentially be increased by incorporating more protein and fat crops, such as legumes and nut trees. © 2019","Dietary recommendations; Food forestry; Food production potential; Food supply capacity; Macronutrients; Nutritional requirements","diet; estimation method; fat; food availability; food production; food security; food supply; laboratory method; malnutrition; nutritive value; production system; protein; research work; sustainability; temperate environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068069117

Lately, the business and labour organisations have raised concerns that the government’s intention to implement the carbon tax policy will affect the food supply, subsequently exacerbating the unemployment and food insecurity in the country. Carbon tax is one of the policy tools to be implemented in order to reduce the growing greenhouse gas emissions thus helping the government meets its Paris Agreement commitments. South Africa’s National Treasury released a second draft of the carbon tax bill in 2017, which takes into account the concerns raised by different organisations. In this paper, we evaluate the potential impact of the carbon tax policy on agriculture, food and other sectors using a dynamic computable general equilibrium model. The results show that the carbon tax is an effective policy tool to mitigate emissions, as they decline by 33% relative to the baseline by 2035. This also leads to a welfare loss of R98.326 billion as the country transforms into a green economy. The carbon-intensive sectors like transport, steel and coal-generated electricity experiences significant output decline. However, the agriculture and food sectors show improvements in terms of jobs and production when the carbon tax is implemented. The positive effects on these two sectors are greatly reduced if tax exemptions provided to the agricultural sector are removed and the tax revenue is not recycled in the form of production subsidy to industries. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Agriculture; Carbon tax; CGE","Agricultural products; Agriculture; Carbon; Economics; Emission control; Food supply; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Agricultural sector; Carbon taxes; Dynamic computable general equilibrium models; Food insecurity; Food production; Green economies; Potential impacts; Tax exemptions; Taxation; agricultural emission; agricultural intensification; environmental economics; environmental policy; food production; green economy; greenhouse gas; international agreement; pollution tax; state role; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067255066

It is a case study, which uses industry data to investigate the impact on climate change, a key driver for electrification, and a wider set of impacts, for average operation in Sweden, the European Union and the United States of America. The results show that non-chargeable hybrid electric vehicles provide clear climate change mitigation potential compared to conventional buses, regardless of the available fuel being diesel or HVO. When fueling with HVO, plug-in hybrid and all-electric buses provide further benefits for grid intensities below 200 g CO2 eq./kWh. For diesel, the all-electric option is preferable up to 750 g CO2 eq./kWh. This is the case despite batteries and other electric powertrain parts causing an increase of CO2 emissions from vehicle production. However, material processing to make common parts, i.e. chassis, frame and body, dominates the production load for all models. Consequently, city buses differ from passenger cars, where the battery packs play a larger role. In regard to other airborne pollutants, the all-electric bus has the best potential to reduce impacts overall, but the results depend on the amount of fossil fuels and combustion processes in the electricity production.

These samples are characterized using XRD, FTIR, DRUV-Vis, XPS and HR-TEM. Glucose with 6 wt.% loading (6C-TiO2) corresponds to the optimum amount of carbon doped into TiO2 achieving a methanol yield of 19.5 mmol gcat-1 h-1, a more than 2-fold increase from that of bare TiO2 at 9.5 mmol gcat-1 h-1. Moreover, the quantum yield of carbon-doped TiO2 increases by ca. 50% compared to bare TiO2. From XPS results, various surface species with C-OH, C=C and C=O functional groups confer the association of ligand-metal-charge-transfer (LMCT) complex between TiO2 and carbon. The low band gap and UV-vis light absorption capacity of carbon-doped TiO2 facilitates the transfer of photo-generated electrons. 6C-TiO2 demonstrates high photostability with constant yield even after five cycles of testing. The mechanism of the carbon-doped TiO2 in reduction of CO2 to methanol is postulated to be consistent with the LMCT complex phenomena. Therefore, 6C-TiO2 photocatalyst provides heterojunction for localization of electrons, hinders the charge recombination rate and narrows the band gap for enhanced photocatalytic activity under UV-VIS light irradiation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2 reduction; Glucose; LMCT; Photocatalyst; TiO2","Carbon dioxide; Charge transfer; Energy gap; Glucose; Heterojunctions; Light absorption; Methanol; Photocatalysts; Photocatalytic activity; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Alternative source; Charge recombinations; CO2 reduction; Enhanced efficiency; LMCT; Photocatalytic reduction; Photogenerated electrons; TiO2; Titanium dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069165955

In this work, based on time-dependent density functional theory calculations, we systematically research the size-dependent optical absorption and emission properties of two-dimensional phosphorene, arsenene, and antimonene single-element QDs. As expected, the photoabsorption gap is monotonically decreasing with the increase of QD diameter, which is consistent with the well-accepted quantum confinement effect (QCE). Surprisingly, the emission gap increases with the increase of size within â'3 nm diameter range. It is revealed that the anomalous phenomenon is derived from the competition between the QCE and excited-state structural rearrangement during the relaxation of the excited state. The smaller two-dimensional QDs is more prone to structural deformation at the excited state accompanied by the greater change of the electronic structure, which prevails over the QCE and reduces the emission gap. The atomic level picture of the anomalous emission phenomenon revealed in our research is valuable for the fundamental understanding of the size effect of QDs as well as for their optical utilization in optoelectronics and biomedical fields.

At the same time, carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions released in Thailand tripled between 1990 and 2015. To examine how international trade plays a role in shaping Thailand's CO2 emissions inventory, we compare emissions under both production-based and consumption-based accounting over 1990–2015 and disaggregate total CO2 emissions into traded and non-traded parts. We also use a multi-regional input-output database for performing a structural decomposition analysis (SDA) to investigate the factors contributing to changes in CO2 emissions. We find that Thailand continually stood out as a net carbon exporting country. CO2 embodied in exports accounted, on average, for 40% of domestically produced emissions. Our SDA results suggest that traded and non-traded emissions grew mainly due to increasing per-capita consumption in Thailand and abroad.

In this study, an online coupled meteorology and chemistry WRF-CMAQ model was applied to simulate such impacts on future O3 and PM2.5 air quality over Continental Southeast Asia. Simulations were conducted for present (2006–2015) and future (2046–2055) years under two climate scenarios, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5. Future climate projections were obtained by implementing a downscaling dynamical method based on pseudo global warming technique. In order to estimate the impacts of climate change alone, anthropogenic and biomass burning emissions were held constant at present level while biogenic emissions varying with climate were used. The model results indicated a future regional meteorology characterized by a warmer and more humid atmosphere, increased precipitation, and more stagnant condition. Affected by climate change, NOx and NMVOCs biogenic emissions increase which contribute to the increasing effects on O3 and PM2.5 precursors concentrations. Subsequently, the changes in meteorology and biogenic emission affect air quality. These influence on ground level O3 and PM2.5 are different between the two climate scenarios. Under RCP4.5 scenario, future atmosphere appears to be reduced in O3 and PM2.5 concentrations, suggesting a potential “climate benefit” for air quality. At four target countries, namely Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam, O3 concentration decreases by −0.76 ppb (−2.40%), PM2.5 concentration decreases by −0.95 μg/m3 (−4.32%) on average for the entire year. However, climate change worsen O3 and PM2.5 air pollution under RCP8.5 scenario. O3 concentration increases by +0.26 ppb (+0.84%), PM2.5 concentration increases by +0.92 μg/m3 (+4.20%) on average for the entire year. Significant increases were generally located in northern Vietnam (for O3) and southern Vietnam (for PM2.5) during the dry season. The analysis suggests that the decrease in O3 concentration is due to the dominancy of the negative effect of water vapor increase and the increase in O3 concentration is affected largely by the temperature increase, stagnant condition, and biogenic emission increase. The responses of PM2.5 to climate change depend on the physical and chemical characteristics of each PM2.5 species. The major climate change effect on PM2.5 is the physical effect, rather than the chemical effect. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change impacts; Continental Southeast Asia; Fine particulate matter; Online coupled WRF-CMAQ model; Ozone","Air quality; Global warming; Ozone; Precipitation (meteorology); Biomass burning emissions; Climate change impact; Cmaq models; Fine particulate matter; Future climate projections; Physical and chemical characteristics; Southeast Asia; Temperature increase; Climate models; nitrogen oxide; non methane volatile organic compound; ozone; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; air quality; anthropogenic source; biogenic emission; biomass burning; climate effect; climate modeling; concentration (composition); downscaling; dry season; future prospect; global warming; nitrate; numerical method; ozone; particulate matter; volatile organic compound; water vapor; air pollution; air quality; air temperature; Article; atmosphere; biomass; Cambodia; carbon footprint; chemistry; climate; climate change; concentration (parameter); environmental impact; fire and fire related phenomena; futurology; greenhouse effect; humidity; Laos; mathematical model; meteorology; particulate matter; precipitation; precursor; priority journal; season; simulation; Thailand; Viet Nam; water vapor; Cambodia; Laos; Thailand; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070818043

The literature on this subject has been provided with countless case studies of the application of this practice in different geographical locations. However, studies concerning Portugal in this area are still scarce. Thus, this article aims to map and analyze the existing cases of industrial symbiosis in Portugal, as well as the current state and the legislative context regarding this practice. It also aims to analyze the main barriers to the growth of synergy relations and outline new paths for the development of industrial symbiosis in Portugal. From the analysis to the case studies, it was possible to conclude that most industrial symbiosis networks have few actors, and networks with two and three are common. However, owing to strategic plans, the type of existing economic activities, and the waste generated, there is much potential for industrial symbiosis networks to be established and to contribute to emission reductions, more efficient use of resources, and reduced external dependence. However, in order to increase industrial symbiosis, concerted action must be taken at various levels to encourage companies to develop synergy relations. Changing the legislative framework, making funds available, the role of local governments, the existence of a facilitator, and the use of some industries as anchor tenants are some of the aspects that can contribute to the increase of industrial symbiosis in Portugal. © 2019 by the authors.","Circular economy; Eco-industrial parks; Industrial symbiosis; Portugal; Sustainability","economic conditions; economic growth; emission control; environmental economics; industrial development; local government; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073598279

However, such indices differ significantly depending on their selected indicators, weighting mechanisms, and summarizing methods, often leading to divergent assessments of vulnerability for the same geographic area. The use of generic indicators might also lead to a loss of information about contextual risks and vulnerabilities. This may reduce the perceived usefulness of indices among stakeholders. This study analyses the role of indicators in assessing agricultural vulnerability to climate change. It analyses how indices are understood and used through three separate focus group sessions, involving agricultural experts professionally active in south-eastern Sweden. The paper presents how agricultural practitioners perceive a set of common vulnerability indicators, presented through a visualization tool, and their relevance, logic, and applicability to assess and address vulnerability to climate change. The results of this study contribute with perspectives on (i) the relevance and applicability of the commonly used generic indicators for agricultural vulnerability (ii) the assumed correlation of indicators with climate vulnerability and (iii) the identification of missing vulnerability indicators. The study finds that commonly used vulnerability indicators are perceived hard to apply in practice, as definitions and thresholds are often depending on the geographical and temporal scale, as well as the regional context. Additional exposure factors that were identified included extreme events, such as heavy precipitation and external factors such as global food demand and trade-patterns. Further, participants expressed that it is important to include indices that combine effects of multiple climatic changes and in-direct factors, such as policies, regulations and measures. Inherent complexities, context dependencies, and multiple factors should further be included, but entail difficulties in developing suitable indicators. These factors must be addressed by a broader set of qualitative and quantitative indicators, and greater flexibility in the assessment methodology. The interactive vulnerability assessments presented in this paper indicate a need for an integration of quantitative and qualitative aspects and how such indicators could be developed and applied. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; AgroExplore; Climate vulnerability; Geographic visualization","Agriculture; Visualization; AgroExplore; Assessment methodologies; Climate vulnerability; Geographic visualization; Perceived usefulness; Quantitative indicators; Vulnerability assessments; Vulnerability indicators; Climate change; climate change; extreme event; geographical variation; nature-society relations; precipitation (climatology); stakeholder; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048596811

From field to farm level, climate also plays a prominent role in ongoing practices, shaping winegrowers’ decision making and adaptive management. With a changing climate, the wine sector faces many environmental and socio-economic challenges, to which winegrowers are required to adapt. Given the perennial nature of grape growing, there is a need to develop strategies that deal with both short- and long-term climate changes, while likewise accounting for contextual vulnerability. The content of this article aims to provide an overview of climate-driven scales, outlining the spatial complexity and temporal dynamics in viticulture. In addressing these aspects, this literature review offers a framework of scale and cross-scale interactions for policymakers and stakeholders to use when considering responses to attenuate climate change and to reduce its impacts on grape and wine production. The article concludes by discussing the local and context-dependent nature of viticulture in a changing global climate, by emphasizing that the question of scale is fundamental to assessing expected impacts, understanding uncertainty and framing sustainable policies and responses over space and in time. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate; Global change; Spatial complexity; Temporal dynamics; Viticulture","adaptive management; agrometeorology; climate change; decision making; literature review; viticulture; wine; Vitaceae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067059268

Therefore, intentions to address these problems require a multi-actor, multi-sector and multilevel approach. The concept that enables joint effort against these problems implies an active participation of all stakeholders, establishes the rules for shared responsibilities and strives to make efficient and effective procedures for addressing these issues is known as “governance” (Mutabdžija, 2012). Climate change and occurance of extreme events are presenting a threat to the natural resources, exposing the vulnerabilities of current resource governance regimes, including also forestry and nature conservation. The occurance of extreme events in last several years thretened the natural resources and impacted the forestry sector in all four selected countries of Southeast Europe (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Serbia, and Slovenia). This has provided a further arguments for understanding the institutional framework for climate change governance in forestry and nature conservation as important element in dealing with uncertanties posed by the climate change challenges on natural resources. Hence, the aim of the paper is to examine the institutional frameworks of forestry and nature conservation, as well as the attitudes of respondents about the competences of the relevant institutions and organizations, to identify the need to improve the existing framework and to evaluate their interests and impacts in climate change governance. In this research were used individual, structured interviews as a research technique in collecting the primary data. The questionnaire consisted of 22 questions, divided into 5 groups. For the purposes of this paper, responses to questions related to institutional frameworks for climate change governance in forestry and nature conservation are analyzed. The sample consisted of 29 representatives (Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina – 8, Croatia – 6, Serbia – 10, Slovenia – 5) from public administrations and services in forestry and nature conservation, enterprises and organization for forest and protected area management, educational and research organizations, and non-governmental organizations. The respondents were selected by judgemental sampling. Current institutional framework for climate change governance comprises of various institutions and organizations in all analyzed countries (Table 1). In selected countries, there is a clear division of responsibilities between public administration institutions in forestry and nature conservation (these institutions are directly or indirectly are related to forestry). There is a number of common primary objectives within the given competencies common to the same organizational category (Table 2), in all four countries. Despite current institutional and organizational variaty and competency alignment between different institutions and organizations, there is a need for further improvement of institutional framework for climate change governance through cooperation and coordination, accross different sectors, institutions and organizations, as stated by the respondents attittudes (Table 3 and 4). Respondents attitudes towards the interest and influence of institutions/organizations on climate change governance are mostly showing a visible interest but indicating challenges in providing suitable inflluence (Table 5). Also, visible discrepancy in assessment of the interest and influence of institutions and organizations on climate change governance is between the respondents from Slovenia and Croatia at one side and respondents from Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia at the other side, indicates differences in inclusion of climate change challenges accross different competency levels. Regardless of the category of institutions and organizations, the respondents recognized the importance of the investigated issues and they assessed its interest as “high” and “very high” (Table 6). Further development of suitable institutional frameworks for climate change governance in forestry and nature conservation needs additional attention especially in the field of multilevel coordination between different actors and their activities, as well as the acknowledgment of potentially significant influence forestry sector might have in climate change governance. © 2019 Hrvatsko Sumarsko Drustvo.

There are many language issues in the ""new"" long-term global phenomenon and study of climate change including global warming as well as weather forecasting, mapping, and reporting. Symbols are widely used as a language, a means of communication in mapping and depicting weather elements through the use of maps. All these symbols which show weather/meteorological elements have specific scientific meaning. The concept of weather is equally understood among the ordinary public across different countries and background. However, it is not the case with climate change. Therefore, much is still to be done in the area of climate change. What happens when this kind of information is disseminated and communicated about in other contexts, involving economists and politicians, media, and the general public? Much effort has been done to connect different nations to common knowledge on climate change, but the question remains: Is the understanding common? One of the many reasons for understanding not to be common is language. With the same understanding but different languages, we can tell different ""stories. ""The meaning that people ascribe to climate change is closely related to how climate change is portrayed in communication. Our understanding is also influenced by overarching international debates. New multidisciplinary approach on climate change research needs to be incorporated to close this gap. This calls for the integration of linguistics, thus enabling policy-makers to communicate at the local as well as at a global scale about what needs to be done and to develop relevant, rigorous, climate-smart, and more action-oriented policies. Inappropriate use of language and terminologies, misconceptions related to weather and climate change, climate change perceptions and communication as well as recommendations thereof are discussed. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

Social-ecological systems are usually researched at one of two spatial scales: local placed-based empirical studies or system-scale modelling, with limited efforts to date exploring the merits of combining these two analytical approaches and scales. Here, we take a multiscale interdisciplinary approach to elucidate the social dynamics underpinning cross-sectoral feedbacks and unintended consequences of decision-making that can affect social-ecological system vulnerability unexpectedly. We combined empirical place-based research with the Robustness Framework, a dynamic system level analysis platform, to analyse the characteristics and robustness of a coastal SES in Cornwall, UK. Embedding place-based empirical analysis into a broader institutional framework revealed SES feedbacks and “maladaptations”. We find that decentralisation efforts coupled with government austerity measures amplify second-order (reputational) risks. This prompted temporal policy trade-offs, which increased individual and community vulnerability and reduced social-ecological system robustness, impeding local adaptation to climate change. We identify opportunities to ameliorate these maladaptations by (1) implementing coordination rules that can guide policymakers in instances of conflicting coastal management pressures, and (2) recognising how second-order risks influence decision-making. This work demonstrates the strengths of combining local and regional analyses to assess the robustness of social-ecological systems exposed to environmental changes, such as climate change and sea level rise. Our results show how analysis of the multiscale effects of climate policies, decision-making processes and second-order risks can usefully support local climate change adaptation planning. © 2019, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate change; Coastal management; First- and second-order risks; Robustness framework; Social-ecological systems; Vulnerability",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070061627

Quantification of water and carbon footprint to define mitigation strategies and a more rational use of natural resources, is a reiterated claim. The aim of this study was to perform an economic evaluation of the environmental impact of the DCPS from the Comarca Lagunera, Mexico (24°N, 102°W, 220 mm, hot-semiarid climate) We contrasted the economic value (EV) generated by the DCPS with respect to the economic costs (EC) due to the greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) and the water footprint (WFP) of this DCPS. While quantifications of GHGE considered those proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the WFP involved the use of blue, gray and green water by the DCPS and related activities. Quantification of the EC of WFP considered an international average price of water. In the year 2017, the Comarca Lagunera registered a dairy cow inventory of 493 144 heads, with 227 142 lactating cows, which produced 2386 million liters of milk per year with an annual average EV of €525.3 million. The EC (€, millions) generated by the GHGE and WFP were €311.8 and €11 980.7, respectively, with a total EC of € 12 292.5 million. When the EV of milk production and the total environmental EC are compared, the contrast demonstrates not only the noteworthy environmental impact but also the significant and senseless biological and EC. In addition, having a large dairy cow concentration creates pollution concerns and the DCPS transfers both nutrients and water resources from an ecologically vulnerable arid region. Therefore, some mitigation strategies such as, better cow genotype, feed and manure management combined with the production of forages and grains in a different geographical region are suggested to promote an optimum use of water in order to uphold the social, economic and biologic sustainability of the Comarca Lagunera, Mexico. © The Animal Consortium 2019.","arid lands; Holstein; intensive systems; sustainability; water footprint","animal; bovine; chemistry; climate change; cost benefit analysis; dairying; environment; female; greenhouse gas; lactation; manure; Mexico; milk; physiology; Animals; Cattle; Climate Change; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Dairying; Environment; Female; Greenhouse Gases; Lactation; Manure; Mexico; Milk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063129949

Eight treatments were used in a randomized complete design with a 2 × 4 factorial arrangement: two diet (20C:80F and 80C:20F concentrate to forage ratio) and four levels of ENP addition (0%, 1.5%, 3.0%, and 4.5% of DM) replacing soybean meal. There was a diet × ENP interaction (p = 0.02) for methane production. According to ENP addition, diets with 80C:20F showed more intense reduction on methane production that 20C:80F. A negative linear effect was observed for propionate production with ENP addition in diet with 80C:20F and to the relative abundance of methanogens Archaea, in both diet. The replacement of soybean meal by ENP in levels up to 3% of DM inhibited methane production due to a reduction in the methanogens community without affecting the organic matter degradability. However, ENP at 4.5% of DM level affected fiber degradability, abundance of cellulolytic bacteria, and propionic acid production, indicating that this level of inclusion is not recommended for ruminant production. © 2019 Japanese Society of Animal Science","bacterial community; hydrogen sink; non-protein nitrogen; short-chain fatty acids","methane; nitric acid derivative; animal; animal food; archaeon; biosynthesis; diet; drug effect; fermentation; in vitro study; intestine flora; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; rumen; ruminant; soybean; veterinary medicine; Animal Feed; Animals; Archaea; Diet; Fermentation; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; In Vitro Techniques; Methane; Nitrates; Rumen; Ruminants; Soybeans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070683701

In a unified simultaneous equation model (SEM), over the period 1976–2015, we investigate the extent to which budget balance behaviour explains the nature of oil production strategies. We find that green regulations have a positive impact on U.S. oil production, while an inverse relationship holds for Saudi Arabia. We argue that the nature of budgetary institutions prevents Saudi Arabia from following a profit maximising behaviour. Saudi Arabia is incentivised to ensure political cohesion through adopting a procyclical fiscal policy. Rather, regulators seem incentivised to channel surplus towards individuals to gain popularity in the United States. A thriving shale oil industry is a plausible rationale for U.S. production strategies. Also known as a weak green paradox, this is problematic for climate change initiatives to reduce global emissions. Climate experts may wish to pay more attention to the supply-side of oil-markets when designing decarbonisation plans. The results challenge conventional wisdom of the green paradox neglecting the role of incentive structure between different types of oil producers. © 2019","Alternative energy; Budget balance; Green paradox; Green regulations; Oil production; Strategies","Climate change; Inverse problems; Alternative energy; Budget balance; Green paradoxes; Green regulations; Oil production; Strategies; Budget control; alternative energy; energy balance; energy budget; energy policy; fiscal policy; oil production; regulatory approach; strategic approach; Saudi Arabia; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068924650

Specifically, I map how the conflicts around which countries should address global warming influenced the domestic politics of climate change in India, particularly the rise of MEA in leading India’s policymaking on climate change, including FCCC negotiations. MEA’s political understanding of climate change, sharpened by two domestic environmental groups–TERI and CSE, decisively shaped India’s approach at FCCC negotiations.

One of the most potential renewable energy resources in Indonesia is solar energy. State Electricity Company of Indonesia has planned to develop solar Photo voltaic (PV) power plan in the document planning 2019-2028. The objective of this study is to explore the contribution of solar PV to the reduction GHG of Indonesia. The potency of solar irradiance and solar PV output in several big cities in Indonesia are discussed. The results show that by using the PV technology of Crystalline silicon with mounting position building integrated and the slope and azimuth is 0°, the average solar PV output in Indonesia is 1361.2 kWh/kWp. The planned solar PV installed capacity by the end of 2028 is 985.5 MW. The electricity resulted by the system in a year will be 1341.47 GWh or it is only 0.31% of national electricity consumption.

However, several barriers still hinder a fast market diffusion of this new technology. Governments around the world have implemented monetary and non-monetary policies to accelerate PEV market diffusion. Their effectiveness is established in the literature, yet the effect size has been only scarcely estimated empirically and only for the US. Here, we review econometric studies on the effect size of purchase incentives and analyse data on PEV sales from 32 European countries from 2010 to 2017 with respect to the effect of financial incentives. We apply panel data regressions and control for other factors such as income and fuel prices. We find energy prices and financial incentives to influence PEV adoption positively. The range of point estimates for the effect of incentives is 5–7% relative sales share increase in different model specifications. Methodologically, the inclusion of a trend variable proved important to capture overall changes in the diffusion of this new technology. Our findings indicate that financial incentives have an impact on PEV sales and thus can facilitate their diffusion. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Electric vehicles; Electric vehicles; Incentives; Tax credit; Technology adoption","Battery electric vehicles; Commerce; Costs; Diffusion; Economic analysis; Electric vehicles; Plug-in electric vehicles; Sales; Taxation; European Countries; Financial incentives; Incentives; Model specifications; Monetary policies; Plug in Electric Vehicle (PEV); Tax credits; Technology adoption; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; econometrics; electric vehicle; environmental economics; panel data; policy implementation; regression analysis; tax incentive; technology adoption; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071396036

We pursue the concept that macrophages, which take up parasites during early infection, exert decisive influence on the inflammatory micromilieu after infection. In order to analyze their distinctive potential, we identified differentially regulated genes of murine granuloma macrophages (GMΦ) from resistant and susceptible mice after their infection with metacyclic Leishmania major. We found induction of several cytokines in GMΦ from both strains and a stronger upregulation of the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) in GMΦ from resistant mice. Using both an AhR agonist and antagonist we demonstrated that AhR is involved in Leishmania-induced production of TNF in macrophages. In vivo, single local injection of an AhR agonist in early lesions of susceptible mice caused an increased induction of Tnf and other cytokines in the skin. Importantly, local agonist treatment led to a reduction of disease severity, reduced parasite loads and a weaker Th2 response.

Ferns depend on climate to regulate their life cycle, because they do not require animal interaction to reproduce. Through the pioneering study of the phenology of Araucaria forest understory in subtropical climate of Brazil, our main aims were (i) to verify which climatic variables influenced the phenological pattern of the community, (ii) to identify the differences in seasonality of ferns in distinct climatic zones of Brazil, and (iii) to compare the phenological pattern of ferns growing in other subtropical regions of the world. In an Araucaria forest fragment, we monitored the phenology of the fern community (leaf production, leaf senescence, and sporangium formation) over 2 years. At the same time, we collected photoperiod, temperature, and precipitation data. Ferns phenology was classified as continuous, discontinuous, regular, and irregular. Our results showed photoperiod and mean temperature as the best predictors for phenology. The reproductive event was seasonal, and the fern community presented themselves as continuous, irregular (activity index), and regular (intensity index) phenophases. Unlike ferns from tropical regions that generally regulate themselves by the rainfall, some ferns in a non-seasonal environment have seasonal behavior in their phenophases due to the greater amplitude of photoperiod and temperature. The community showed the same pattern of leaf production observed in populations of other subtropical regions in the world. This behavior represented the biological response of the vegetation dynamics in relation to the climatic variability of subtropical environment. © 2019, ISB.","Circular statistics; GAMLSS; Mixed ombrophilous forest; Phenological strategy; Seasonality; Subtropical climate","animal; Brazil; fern; forest; plant leaf; season; tree; Animals; Brazil; Ferns; Forests; Plant Leaves; Seasons; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069734737

The DD is caused by non-ionizing-energy-loss (NIEL) process and results in reduction of light emission of the GAL when connected to a power source. Based on this finding a lightweight, low current consuming proton detector for space applications was developed. A commercial off the shelf (COTS) yellow GAL optically coupled to a Light-to-Frequency converter chip (LFC) made the basic assembly of the proposed proton detector. The device was calibrated using selected GAL samples irradiated with a 180 MeV proton beam from a proton-therapy medical cyclotron to 2, 10, 50, 100, 200 and 300 Gy dose levels. The light output of the GAL was measured with the detector assembly and presented as frequency (kHz). Protons of energy distribution between 100 keV to ∼500 MeV are trapped in the inner-shell of the Van Allen belt (VAB) surrounding the earth, whereas the intensity of trapped electrons (Emax ∼10 MeV) remains insignificant. The GAL light output data (frequency) was fitted with a second-degree polynomial function of imparted proton dose (∼ number of protons). The results were parameterized for widely used NASA radiation belt models AP8-Max and AP8-Min using the proton NIEL distribution in Gallium Arsenide (GaAs). Spacecrafts, in particular Nanosatellites operating in low earth orbit (LEO) environment are primarily exposed to those trapped protons in the VAB. Nanosatellites endure severe radiation exposure while passing through the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region. The footprint, mass and average current consumption of the proton detector was 0.027 cm2, 0.28 g and 2.5 mA respectively. The highest detectable level proton fluence (protons·cm−2) was evaluated to be 1.17 × 109 and 1.01 × 109 for AP8-Max and AP8-Min models respectively. Hence the proposed GAL based radiation detector is only suited for proton fluence monitoring on board LEO-Nanosatellites (NanoSat) of short lifetime, usually 6-18 months. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd and Sissa Medialab.","Dosimetry concepts and apparatus; Particle detectors; Solid state detectors","Commercial off-the-shelf; Electric frequency control; Energy dissipation; Gallium; Gallium arsenide; III-V semiconductors; Light emitting diodes; Nanosatellites; NASA; Orbits; Proton beams; Radiation belts; Semiconducting gallium; Space applications; Displacement damages; Energy distributions; Feasibility studies; Low earth orbit(LEO); Nonionizing energy loss; Radiation belt model; Second degree polynomials; South atlantic anomalies; Proton beam therapy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101088454

To quantify the territory emissions (Baseline Emission Inventory BEI), local authorities had to rely on inaccurate data that generated inaccurate results. Furthermore, classical tools would not allow any authority wishing to join without any technical assistance from CES-MED to identify and determine the performance of each measure in order to elaborate a feasible Sustainable Energy and Climate Action Plan (SECAP). A new tool is necessary to fill the gaps and lead to a more developed approach, more generalized and adapted to the regional context. The first part developed of this tool can assess the basic situation of a municipality in terms of calculating emissions. A second part of this tool is to identify priority energy efficiency measures, determine the performance of each measure and the related investment costs, in order to develop the SECAP for any authority in Lebanon and in the region. This operational, reliable and effective tool called SECAP-SSP includes a specific database for Lebanon and the region to help municipalities calculate baseline emissions and assess the impacts of different SEAP measures. The new tool takes into account most of sectors contributing to the environmental impacts, to study their environmental performance, to succeed by modelling the determination of Optimum Energy Performance / Environmental Benefit / Costs of energy efficiency measures in the various sectors of the municipality. Depending on the magnitude of the contribution of each sector, the municipality will have the choice to decide on the measures to be implemented.

However, they require larger energy supplies, so that their environmental impacts remain uncertain, as illustrated by the contradictory results in the literature. Besides, solar radiation is often too high relative to the photosynthetic capacity of microalgae. This leads to photosaturation, photoinhibition, overheating and eventually induces mortality. Shadowing microalgae with solar panels would, therefore, be a promising solution for both increasing productivity during hotter periods and producing local electricity for the process. The main objective of this study is to measure, via LCA framework, the energy performance and environmental impact of microalgae biodiesel produced in a solar greenhouse, alternating optimal microalgae species and photovoltaic panel (PV) coverage. A mathematical model is simulated to investigate the microalgae productivity in raceways under meteorological conditions in Sophia Antipolis (south of France) at variable coverture percentages (0% to 90%) of CIGS solar panels on greenhouses constructed with low-emissivity (low-E) glass. Results: A trade-off must be met between electricity and biomass production, as a larger photovoltaic coverture would limit microalgae production. From an energetic point of view, the optimal configuration lies between 10 and 20% of PV coverage. Nevertheless, from an environmental point of view, the best option is 50% PV coverage. However, the difference between impact assessments obtained for 20% and 50% PV is negligible, while the NER is 48% higher for 20% PV than for 50% PV coverage. Hence, a 20% coverture of photovoltaic panels is the best scenario from an energetic and environmental point of view. Conclusions: In comparison with the cultivation of microalgae without PV, the use of photovoltaic panels triggers a synergetic effect, sourcing local electricity and reducing climate change impacts. Considering an economic approach, low photovoltaic panel coverage would probably be more attractive.

This study attempts to examine the factors affecting the production and increase in carbon emission in urban areas and also provides some solutions to solve these problems and create low-carbon urban areas in order to promote environmental quality with a sustainable development approach. Then, some tools and methods are developed to improve the analytical rigor associated with climate action plans. With a focus on non-behavioral items, the cost and effectiveness of more than 30 action items are quantified. Finally, the scenario analysis was used to evaluate the cost and efficiency of various program designs. Results indicate that greenhouse gases mitigation takes remarkable initial investments. This cost differs from $1 to $70 M for each percent of reduction depending on scale and scope of the program. However, long-term cost savings are considerable if the program is properly designed, with the 20-year return period for different climate action plans, exceeding 100%. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Climate change; Emission mitigation; Life-cycle analysis; Low-carbon city; Sustainable development","Carbon; Climate change; Climate models; Environmental management; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Planning; Sustainable development; Emission mitigation; Environmental quality; Life cycle analysis; Life cycle cost analysis; Low-carbon cities; Sustainable environment; Tools and methods; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Cost benefit analysis; action plan; carbon emission; climate change; conceptual framework; cost analysis; emission control; environmental economics; environmental quality; investment incentive; sustainability; sustainable development; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053540810

This article presents a service evaluation of an innovative, nurse-led telephone follow-up service for a group of elective bowel cancer patients following surgery. Methods: The records of patients who underwent surgery over a 2-year period were accessed to determine the number of telephone follow-ups and other investigations. This was used to model the potential cost saving for commissioners against traditional clinic follow-up. Patient satisfaction was assessed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer questionnaire on Outpatient Satisfaction in 30 patients. Results: Feedback on the service was overwhelmingly positive, with patients praising the care received from the specialist nurses, but also commenting on increased continuity of care, ease of access and convenience. The service also potentially creates significant savings for commissioners as the agreed tariff for nurse telephone follow-up is significantly less than the outpatient tariff. Discussion: This innovative follow-up system is well liked by patients and should provide savings for commissioners. The hospital also benefits from an increase in capacity to see new or more unwell patients, and a reduction in carbon emissions. Such a service, however, is dependent on people, and although it has functioned effectively in this department for approximately 20 years, it would only be generalisable to other units if staff had appropriate expertise. © 2019 MA Healthcare Ltd.","Bowel cancer; Cost-saving; Follow-up; Nurse-led; Patient satisfaction; Telephone","aftercare; colorectal tumor; health services research; human; mass communication; national health service; nurse specialist; organization and management; telephone; United Kingdom; Aftercare; Colorectal Neoplasms; Diffusion of Innovation; Health Services Research; Humans; Nurse Specialists; State Medicine; Telephone; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074087231

It provides a standard platform where knowledge of the experts is captured and stored for re-use, improving confidence level of suggestions, training generic automation engineers on system specific aspects as well as support handling unknown source systems.

Online mapping is one of the fundamental services offered in smart cities which enables the vehicle owners to find shortest or fastest direction toward a destination thus reduces travel cost and air pollution. However, existing online mapping services rely on centralized servers, e.g., Google, which collect data from users to offer service. This method is unlikely to scale with growth in the smart city participants and introduces privacy concerns and data wall where data of the users is managed by big companies. To address these challenges, in this paper we introduce DMap, a blockchain-based platform where the users can share data in an anonymous distributed manner with service providers. To the best of our knowledge, DMap is the first distributed blockchain-based solution for online mapping. To improve the scalability of the blockchain, we propose to use edge-computing along with blockchain. To protect against malicious vehicles that may inject false data, we define a reputation system where the collected data of the vehicles is verified by monitoring the neighbor data.

The ability of online supervision on the distribution of vehicles in urban environments prevents traffic, which in turn reduces air pollution and noise. However, this is extremely challenging due to the small size of vehicles, their different types and orientations, and the visual similarity to some other objects in very high resolution images. In this paper, an automatic vehicle recognition algorithm is proposed based on very high spatial resolution aerial images. In the first step of the proposed method, by generating the image pyramid, the candidate regions of the vehicles are recognized. Then, performing reverse pyramid, decision level fusion of the vehicle candidates and the land use/cover classification results of the original image resolution are performed in order to modify recognized vehicle regions. For evaluating the performance of the proposed method in this study, Ultracam aerial imagery with spatial resolution of 11 cm and 3 spectral bands have been used. Comparing the obtained vehicle recognition results from the proposed decision fusion algorithm with some manually selected vehicle regions confirm the accuracy of about %80. Moreover, the %78.87 and 0.71 are respectively the values for overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the obtained land use/cover classification map from decision fusion algorithm. © 2019 M.

The objective of 'RIVER' project is to apply an oxyfuel combustion technology for diesel engines that eliminates NOx emissions, and captures and stores all carbon dioxide emissions in order to achieve zero-carbon and zero other pollutant emissions. As part of this project, a 3-D computational fluid dynamics model coupled with detailed chemical kinetics has been used to evaluate the influence of oxyfuel combustion on engine operating conditions and combustion characteristic in a high speed direct injection (HSDI) diesel engine under homogenous charge compression ignition (HCCI) mode. In this work, a reduced chemical n-heptane-n-butanol-PAH mechanism which consists 76 species and 349 reactions has been applied to simulate the combustion process. The mechanism has been initially validated by experiments under HCCI combustion mode and then, it has been used to examine the oxyfuel combustion using different diluent strategies over a range of air-fuel equivalence ratio (lambda). The simulation results indicate that increasing the inlet carbon dioxide concentration, as a diluent gas, under constant fueling rate does not bring any serious change to the amount of brake mean effective pressure (BMEP) in the relatively rich mixtures regions. However, by decreasing the fuel rate (higher lambda) the difference between different diluent strategies become more obvious as the minimum amount of BMEP is achieved when 83% of carbon dioxide is used. In addition, the results show a considerable reduction of PM emissions while the NOx emission have been completely eliminated using oxyfuel combustion. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Carbon dioxide; Computational fluid dynamics; Diesel engines; Direct injection; Global warming; Heptane; Nitrogen oxides; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Ships; Brake mean effective pressures; Carbon dioxide concentrations; Combustion characteristics; Computational fluid dynamics modeling; Engine operating conditions; High speed direct injections; Homogenous charge compression ignition; Oxy-fuel combustion technology; Ignition",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85078864106

Yet, most global climate change policy involves rationales and mechanisms grounded in an interest-based logic of consequences: information-sharing, reciprocity, and exchange. We argue that strategies that promote ethics-based discourse and policies offer considerable promise for hastening stronger global climate governance. We argue that successes in human security norm-building, including bans on land mines, cluster munitions, and nuclear weapons, provide climate scholars and practitioners with alternative governance models that rely on activating a logic of appropriateness and spearhead faster, more effective climate action. We identify five strategies that previous scholars have shown fostered efforts to promote a logic of appropriateness in human rights, humanitarian law, and disarmament. We examine the empirical experience of those strategies and particularly highlight the recent success of efforts to negotiate a treaty banning nuclear weapons. Given the success of these strategies in other issue areas, we argue scholars of climate change could fruitfully focus greater attention on political efforts that promote strong global ethical norms for climate action. © 2019 The Author(s).

We then demonstrate experimentally that individual support for pro-climate policies increases after respondents update their second-order beliefs.

Fisheries using light sources for attraction could be widely impacted by the shift to light emitting diode (LED) light systems. We studied the transition from kerosene lanterns to LED lamps in Lake Tanganyika, East Africa, examining factors that led to adoption as well as the impact of the new light sources on fish catch and composition. We used a combination of field experiments with catch assessments, fisher surveys, underwater light spectra measurements, and cost assessments to evaluate the impact of switching from kerosene to LED lamps. Overall, we found a very rapid rate of adoption of homemade outdoor LED light systems in Lake Tanganyika. Most of the batteries used to power these lamps were charged from the city power grid, rather than photovoltaic cells, although the potential exists for a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. The LED light spectra was distinct from the kerosene light and penetrated much deeper into the water column. Regardless of light type, most of the fish caught within the two dominant species were below maturity. Although the LED lamps were associated with a slight increase in catch, environmental factors, particularly distance offshore, were generally more important in determining fish catch size and composition. The main advantages of the LED lamps were the lower operating costs and their robustness in bad weather. Thus, the primary effect of the use of battery-powered LED lighting systems to attract fish in Lake Tanganyika appears to reduce economic costs and increasing efficiency.

This can have a significant impact on energy consumption at a global scale as such systems consume about 40% of electricity and create about 36% of the CO2 emissions in Europe. Previous approaches to occupancy estimation either utilize methods that do not ensure people's privacy when obtaining high accuracy estimations, such as RGB cameras, or utilize thermal or radar sensors with lower accuracy. Thermal vision for people detection has several advantages. It protects people's privacy while being less affected by changes in the environment. In addition, most of the previous image processing approaches rely on streaming the data to the cloud to be analyzed. However, with the development of the more distributed network paradigms edge and fog computing, there has been a trend in moving computation towards the edge of the network. This process of embedding intelligence into end-devices enables more efficient energy consumption and network load distribution. In this work, we present an embedded algorithm for room occupancy estimation based on a thermal sensor with accuracy over the state-of-the-art. We study the performance of a variety of deep learning models on different embedded processors. We achieve a prediction accuracy of 98.9% for people counting estimation with minimal 2 KB RAM utilization. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm has very low latency achieving execution times under 14 ms. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Edge computing; Embedded AI; Embedded intelligence; Intelligent buildings; IoT; Thermal imaging","Cooling systems; Deep learning; Edge computing; Embedded systems; Energy utilization; Fog computing; Image analysis; Infrared imaging; Intelligent buildings; Network architecture; Distributed networks; Embedded algorithms; Embedded intelligence; Embedded processors; People detection; Prediction accuracy; State of the art; Thermal image analysis; Internet of things",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079090531

Climate change is already producing impacts on marine ecosystems through overall changes in habitats, productivity and increased variability of environmental conditions. The way how these will affect fisheries is under debate and, also there is uncertainty on the best course of action to mitigate climate change impacts on fisheries. Harvest control rules are sets of pre-agreed rules that can be used to determine catch limits periodically and describe how harvest is automatically controlled by management in relation to the state of some indicator of stock status. In 2017, the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas adopted a harvest control rule for North Atlantic albacore. This harvest control rule was evaluated using Management Strategy Evaluation against the main sources of uncertainty inherent to this fishery. Here, we used the same framework to evaluate the robustness of the adopted rule against two types of potential climate change impacts on North Atlantic albacore dynamics. First, we evaluated how the control rule would perform in the event of overall changes in productivity in the North Atlantic and second, against increases in climate driven recruitment variability. Overall, our results suggest that the adopted harvest control rule is robust to these climate driven impacts and also suggests bounds at which the current management framework would be vulnerable to climate change. Throughout the manuscript we also discuss the potential of harvest control rules and harvest strategies to adapt fisheries management to a changing environment. Our main conclusion is that despite the many uncertainties on climate impacts on fisheries, efficient fisheries management and HCRs will be critical to ensure the sustainability of fisheries in the future. © Copyright © 2019 Merino, Arrizabalaga, Arregui, Santiago, Murua, Urtizberea, Andonegi, De Bruyn and Kell.","adaptability; climate change; harvest control rule; management strategy evaluation; North Atlantic albacore",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074151923

There are several justifications for re-thinking for the sustainable use of crop biodiversity in our breeding programs. Thirty-one durum wheat farmers' varieties (FVs), together with five improved check varieties, were characterized in Tigray during 2014 and 2015 main cropping seasons. The genotype effect explained most of the variations in measured traits, which enabled us to identify superior and stable genotypes for wider adaptation as well varieties with more local adaptation. The genotypes and test locations imposed a highly significant (P < 0.001) effect on both phenological and quantitative traits. A yield advantage of 14.3% was obtained from top performer FV over top performer improved variety, Asassa. Of the tested FVs, 27.8% were superior for grain yield (GY) than improved varieties and 19.4% of these superior FVs were more stable and adaptable than the improved varieties. Besides giving higher GY with spatial stability, they qualify for industrial requirements with high-grain protein (>13%) and gluten (>33%) contents. FVs such as G10, G16, G21, G22 and G30 have wider adaptability and are suitable for production in all tested areas. As outcome of this study, two superior FVs, G10 (208304) and G30 (8208), were nationally released for commercial production for their productivity, stability and grain quality. Utilizing the diverse durum wheat FVs can effectively improve productivity and adaptability. Wheat breeders need to revisit these resources to improve adaptation of wheat production to the changing climatic conditions.

Such refugia may affect evolutionary processes and the maintenance of biodiversity. Numerous refugia have been identified in the context of Quaternary climate oscillations. With climate warming, there is an increasing need to apply insights from the past to characterize potential future refugia. Mountainous regions, due to the provision of spatially heterogeneous habitats, may contain high biodiversity, particularly important during climate oscillations. Here, we highlight the importance of mountaintops as climate refugia, using the example of high-mountain oaks which are distributed on the ranges of the Himalaya–Hengduan Mountains, and at high elevations in tropical rainforests. The occurrences of cold-adapted high-mountain oaks on mountaintops amidst tropical rainforest indicate that such locations are and will be climate refugia as global warming continues. We examine factors that predict the occurrence of future climate refugia on mountaintops using recognized historical refugia. Future research is needed to elucidate the fine-scale processes and particular geographic locations that buffer species against the rapidly changing climate to guide biodiversity conservation efforts under global warming scenarios. © 2019, Swiss Botanical Society.","Biodiversity; Changing climate; Climate refugia; Global warming; Mountaintops; Oak trees","biodiversity; climate change; deciduous tree; global warming; mountain environment; refugium; species occurrence; tropical region; China; Hengduan Mountains; Himalayas; Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071645881

A lack of understanding of whether responses of community reproductive and vegetative phenological sequences to warming and cooling are asymmetrical or symmetrical limits our capacity to predict responses under warming and cooling. A reciprocal transplant experiment was conducted for 3 years to evaluate response patterns of the temperature sensitivities of community phenological sequences to warming (transferred downward) and cooling (transferred upward) along four elevations on the Tibetan Plateau. We found that the temperature sensitivities of flowering stages had asymmetric responses to warming and cooling, whereas symmetric responses to warming and cooling were observed for the vegetative phenological sequences. Our findings showed that coverage changes of flowering functional groups (FFGs; i.e., early-spring FFG, mid-summer FFG, and late-autumn FFG) and their compensation effects combined with required accumulated soil temperatureto codetermined the asymmetric and symmetric responses of community phenological sequences to warming and cooling. These results suggest that coverage change in FFGs on warming and cooling processes can be a primary driver of community phenological variation and may lead to inaccurate phenlogical estimation at large scale, such as based on remote sensing. © Copyright © 2019 Meng, Zhang, Niu, Suonan, Zhang, Wang, Li, Lv, Wang, Duan, Liu, Renzeng, Jiang, Luo, Dorji, Wang and Du.","community phenological sequences; plant–climate interactions; reciprocal transplant experiment; temperature sensitivities; Tibetan Plateau",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85091726276

As a consequence of these changes, several climate models forecast an intensification of extreme weather events over the upcoming decades, including heat waves and increasingly severe drought and flood episodes. The occurrence of such extreme weather will prompt profound changes in several plant communities, resulting in massive forest dieback events that can trigger a massive loss of biodiversity in several biomes worldwide. Despite the gravity of the situation, our knowledge regarding how extreme weather events can undermine the performance, survival, and distribution of forest species remains very fragmented. Therefore, the present review aimed to provide a broad and integrated perspective of the main biochemical, physiological, and morpho-anatomical disorders that may compromise the performance and survival of forest species exposed to climate change factors, particularly drought, flooding, and global warming. In addition, we also discuss the controversial effects of high CO2 concentrations in enhancing plant growth and reducing the deleterious effects of some extreme climatic events.

This paper builds on recent UOGD research discussing mini-booms/busts of the industry and considers factors affecting resilience of local businesses to cyclical effects using a case study of coalbed methane (coal seam gas) in Australia. The paper takes a mixed methods approach, combining qualitative interviews with local business communities and econometric modelling to quantitatively forecast potential changes in indirect employment under different scenarios for the period 2014–2034. The quantitative results demonstrate that, across all scenarios, employment rises in the sort to medium term then declines in the longer term. The scenario with the best economic resilience (long-term employment outcomes) involved decreasing dependence on the gas industry over time. The qualitative results show that experiences of local businesses did not readily align either to traditional long boom/bust nor the shorter periods of mini-booms and mini-busts, and many struggled to manage cyclical effects. In particular, local businesses had difficulty when an unforeseen lull in industry activity stretched out for several months before drilling eventually resumed. Taken combined, the qualitative and quantitative results indicate that the ‘bust’ part of UOGD is very much alive and may have been underestimated in recent literature. The findings emphasise that to manage unpredictable cyclical effects, there is a need for businesses to be flexible while retaining coping mechanisms for unforeseen circumstances. We conclude that economic effects of UOGD can vary considerably, noting that timing plays an important role as to how industry cycles play out and whether busts are relatively small corrections that can be absorbed by local economies or whether they are outside the realms of local resilience. We also draw attention to the role of intermediaries who play a critical role in providing trusted advice at a time of information overload and conflicting perspectives. We emphasise the need for policies to encourage economic resilience, based on diversification and assistance to local businesses to increase their adaptive resilience towards fluctuating periods of prosperity and recession. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coalbed methane; Commodity cycles; Hydraulic fracturing; Resilience",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068122275

This move towards the “blue economy” is becoming globally widespread, with the recognition that if ocean-based activities are to be sustainable, they will need to move beyond solely extractive and exploitative endeavours, aligning more closely with marine conservation and effective marine spatial planning. In this paper we define the “blue economy” as a “platform for strategic, integrated and participatory coastal and ocean development and protection that incorporates a low carbon economy, the ecosystem approach and human well-being through advancing regional industries, services and activities”. In Peru, while the seas contribute greatly to the national economy, the full potential of the blue economy has yet to be realised. This paper presents the findings of an early career scientist workshop in Lima, Peru, in March 2016. The workshop “Advancing Green Growth in Peru” brought together researchers to identify challenges and opportunities for green growth across three Peruvian economic sectors—tourism, transport and the blue economy with this paper exploring in detail the priorities generated from the “blue economy” stream. These priorities include themes such as marine spatial planning, detailed evaluations of existing maritime industries (e.g. guano collection and fisheries), development of an effective MPA network, support for sustainable coastal tourism, and better inclusion of social science disciplines in understanding societal and political support for a Peruvian blue economy. In addition, the paper discusses the research requirements associated with these priorities. While not a comprehensive list, these priorities provide a starting point for future dialogue on a co-ordinated scientific platform supporting the blue growth agenda in Peru, and in other regions working towards a successful “blue economy”. © 2018, The Author(s).","Blue economy; Blue growth; Marine; Society; Sustainability","economic activity; economic growth; marine policy; research work; spatial planning; sustainability; sustainable development; Lima [Peru]; Peru",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85044025214

Phosphoribulokinase (PRK) and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) are essential CB-cycle enzymes that control substrate availability for the carboxylation enzyme Rubisco. PRK consumes ATP to produce the Rubisco substrate ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP). GAPDH catalyzes the reduction step of the CB cycle with NADPH to produce the sugar glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP), which is used for regeneration of RuBP and is the main exit point of the cycle. GAPDH and PRK are coregulated by the redox state of a conditionally disordered protein CP12, which forms a ternary complex with both enzymes. However, the structural basis of CB-cycle regulation by CP12 is unknown. Here, we show how CP12 modulates the activity of both GAPDH and PRK. Using thermophilic cyanobacterial homologs, we solve crystal structures of GAPDH with different cofactors and CP12 bound, and the ternary GAPDH-CP12-PRK complex by electron cryo-microscopy, we reveal that formation of the N-terminal disulfide preorders CP12 prior to binding the PRK active site, which is resolved in complex with CP12. We find that CP12 binding to GAPDH influences substrate accessibility of all GAPDH active sites in the binary and ternary inhibited complexes. Our structural and biochemical data explain how CP12 integrates responses from both redox state and nicotinamide dinucleotide availability to regulate carbon fixation. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

One example is the group of planners in the field of sports and tourism. A promising approach is the visualization of climate thresholds in a Climate-Tourism/Transfer-Information Scheme (CTIS) for the prevailing local climate conditions. The presented approach is adaptable to specific destinations and target activities and integrates meteorological, as well as recreational, touristic and specific activity-related parameters and thresholds. All parameters are simplified in terms of factors and combined in one individual graph, the CTIS diagram. The detailed information on local climate can be applied by non-experts like tourists intending to attend a sports event. They are able to prepare for different aspects of the local climate by, e.g., selecting appropriate clothing when planning their stay.

These transition of the vehicle fleet into electric is being carried out progressively. In the last decades, several technological milestones have been achieved, which range from the development of basic components to the current integrated electric drives made of silicon (Si) based power modules. In this context, the automotive industry and political and social agents are forcing the current technology of electric drives to its limits. For example, the U.S Department of Energy's goals for 2020 include the development of power converter technologies with power densities higher than 14.1 kW/kg and efficiencies greater than 98%. Additionally, target price of power converters has been set below $3.3/kW. Thus, these goals could be only achieved by using advanced semiconductor technologies. Wide-bandgap (WBG) semiconductors, and, most notably, silicon carbide (SiC) based power electronic devices, have been proposed as the most promising alternative to Si devices due to their superior material properties. As the power module is one of the most significant component of the traction power converter, this work focuses on an in-deep review of the state of the art concerning such element, identifying the electrical requirements for the modules and the power conversion topologies that will best suit future drives. Additionally, current WBG technology is reviewed and, after a market analysis, the most suitable power semiconductor devices are highlighted. Finally, this work focuses on practical design aspects of the module, such as the layout of the module and optimum WBG based die parallelization, placement and Direct Bonded Copper (DBC) routing. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Connectors; DBC; EV; GaN; Gate-attack; Layout; Parallelization; Parasitic inductances; Power module; Power semiconductors; SiC; WBG","Automotive industry; Connectors (structural); Electric drives; Electric power systems; Energy gap; Fleet operations; Fossil fuels; Gallium nitride; III-V semiconductors; Power converters; Semiconductor device manufacture; Semiconductor devices; Silicon carbide; Gate-attack; Layout; Parallelizations; Parasitic inductances; Power module; Power semiconductors; Wide band gap semiconductors",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071617030

Uniformly weighted multi-model averages have been used to describe how ARs will change in the future, but this type of estimate does not consider skill or independence of the climate models of interest. Here, we utilize information from various model averaging approaches, such as Bayesian model averaging (BMA), to evaluate 21 global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5. Model ensemble weighting strategies are based on model independence and AR performance skill relative to ERA-Interim reanalysis data and result in higher accuracy for the historic period, for example, root mean square error for AR frequency (in % of time steps) of 0.69 for BMA versus 0.94 for the multi-model ensemble mean. Model weighting strategies also result in lower uncertainties in the future estimates, for example, only 20–25% of the total uncertainties seen in the equal weighting strategy. These model averaging methods show, with high certainty, that globally the frequency of ARs is expected to have average relative increases of ~50% (and ~25% in AR intensity) by the end of the century. ©2019.

For this purpose, the spatial dynamics of the fungal communities associated with three soil-plant compartments (bulk soil, rhizosphere and endorhizosphere) were characterized by ITS high-throughput amplicon sequencing (HTAS). Fungal communities were largely affected in their diversity and composition by soil-plant compartments, whereas the spatial variation (i.e. across five vineyards) was low. The endorhizosphere compartment differed most from the other two, suggesting that the root tissues entail a barrier for fungal colonization. The results of functional prediction via FUNGuild suggested an increase in the relative abundances of potential plant pathogens, endophytes and arbuscular mycorrhiza, and a decrease in wood, dung and undefined saprotrophs from bulk soil towards the endorhizosphere. Roots of asymptomatic vines were a microbial niche that is inhabited by soilborne fungi associated with grapevine trunk diseases, which opens up new perspectives in the study of the endophytic role of these pathogens on grapevines. Results obtained in this study provide helpful information to better know how the host shapes its microbiome and the implications for vineyard productivity and management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd and British Mycological Society","Culture-independent analysis; Endophytes; Fungal recruitment; Grapevine trunk disease; High-throughput amplicon sequencing; Microbial ecology; Microbiome",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073650870

The generality is a result of incorporating hydrogen bonding interactions between unsaturated bonds and water in a general/scalable way. Further, we extend our PC-SAFT hydrocarbon characterization model EMPETRO to allow for aromatics to receive hydrogen bonds from hydrogen bond donors (water, ethanol, etc.).

However, the efficacy of PCMs depends highly on its thermo-physical properties and climatic condition. In this regard, a multi-objective optimization technique is adopted to unearth the optimal type and location of PCM that can minimize heating and cooling loads considering five cities of Iran namely Tehran, Tabriz, Bandar Abas, Shiraz and Yazd with distinctive climates. Then, the optimal PCMs are environmentally and economically assessed. The study showed that the PCM with a melting temperature of 25 °C outperforms in terms of cooling load while the PCM with a melting temperature of 21 °C favors the heating performance. Moreover, the utilization of PCM results in electricity saving of 4.5–5.5% for all the climates. On average, the annual carbon footprint is reduced by 1297 kg, 1420 kg, 2040 kg, 1027 kg, and 1248 kg for Tehran, Tabriz, Bandar Abas, Shiraz, and Yazd, respectively.

This germplasm was propagated in a nursery, by grafting onto seedlings of Olea europaea L., and planted in an experimental orchard, in an olive district located in the South-west of the Island, where they were evaluated for over 30 years and selected for their early bearing, high and constant productivity, as well as high oil content of the fruits and excellent chemical (oleic acid and phenol content) and organoleptic profile of the oil. This paper reports data on the horticultural performances (production, vigor, crop efficiency and oil quality) of four cultivars (‘Kalat’, ‘Olivo di Mandanici’, ‘Abunara’ and ‘Minuta’), selected within the Sicilian's autochthonous germplasm trained as 'Free Palmetta' and tested in a hedgerow planting system at three different planting densities: 500, 666 and 1000 trees ha-1. The cultivar ‘Nocellara del Belice’, ‘Cerasuola, and ‘Biancolilla’, widely cultivated in the area where the trial was carried out, were used as references. The outstanding performance of the cultivar ‘Kalat’ at planting density of 1000 trees ha−1, suggests that this cultivar can be a promising choice for the super high density orchards (SHD). The other cultivars tested did not performed as ‘Kalat’ and seem not suitable for SHD planting system due to their high vigor. The hedgerow planting system tested, in the first 6 years of planting, increaseed productivity of all cultivars compared to traditional olive orchard typical of the area where the trial was conducted. This hedgerow olive orchard may represent a valid solution to increase orchard productivity and to reduce harvest costs by mechanization, depending on tree high, with straddle or side by side canopy contact machines. Achieve higher yield and reducing management costs using autochthonous, resilient cultivars, could be a new strategy to counteract climate changes. The unique organoleptic profiles of the oils obtained from the cultivars tested, could improve the offer of tasty, flavored and nutraceutical extra virgin olive oils in the international markets.

BVOCs exchanges are related to plant species and environmental factors, as temperature, radiation and water availability. Since Sorghum bicolor L. is becoming an increasingly valid alternative to maize in Southern Europe as well as in any non-irrigated region with limited precipitation, is important understand its potential BVOCs exchanges pattern. Up to now, only few studies have focused on BVOCs exchanges at ecosystem scale over an entire growing season, and no one investigated sorghum or other crops in the Mediterranean area. For the first time in this paper, BVOCs fluxes in a sorghum field at ecosystem scale over a whole growing season in Southern Italy are presented. Using online PTR-TOF BVOCs detection and eddy covariance technique, we continuously followed BVOCs exchanges for about 3 months. Methanol was the main emitted compound with a total average emission of 0.1 nmol m-2 s-1, followed by acetaldehyde, with a total average emission of 0.04 nmol m-2 s-1. Their fluxes were correlated with developing and cutting, following the plant growth and the escaping routes from intracellular storage. Other oxygenated compounds (OVOCs) like formaldehyde acetone, acetic acid, formic acid, MVK/MAC, were also exchanged. Monoterpenes were mainly taken up, with a total average uptake of-0.015 nmol m-2 s-1. Net emissions of green leaves volatiles (GLVs) during the stages where lodging and cutting occurred, are related to mechanical stress. These results show variable dynamics for the investigated BVOCs. The exchanges match with those observed on other croplands (mainly maize) for some compounds, meanwhile for other compounds they seem to be different, revealing a variability related to species and world region. Finally, is to be considered that not only weather and seasonality determine BVOCs exchanges patterns, but also phenology, crop management and stress. Therefore, BVOCs can be used to predict changes in phenology or the onset of stress, helping to determine the health state of crops in a climate changes scenarios. © 2019 IEEE.","eddy covariance; Mediterranean; OVOCs; phenology; PTR-TOF.","Acetone; Air quality; Climate change; Crops; Ecosystems; Monoterpenes; Plants (botany); Timber; Volatile organic compounds; Eddy covariance; Mediterranean; OVOCs; phenology; PTR-TOF; Forestry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076349592

The cis-H,T-[Rh2(mhp)2(L)2]2+ architecture is composed of two electron-rich mhp- bridging ligands, two electron-accepting diimine chelating ligands, L, and the redox-active Rh2(II,II) bimetallic core. Rh2-phen2 and Rh2-dpq2 display metal-centered Rh2 II,II/II,I reduction waves at -0.36 and -0.29 V vs Ag/AgCl, followed by a reduction event localized on the phen and dpq ligands at -1.15 V and -1.07 vs Ag/AgCl, respectively, in CH3CN under N2. A second metal-centered reduction is observed at -1.70 and -1.52 V vs Ag/AgCl in Rh2-phen2 and Rh2-dpq2, respectively. Under a CO2 atmosphere and 3 M H2O as the proton source, both complexes display catalytic currents near the third reduction couple. Although both Rh2-phen2 and Rh2-dpq2 possess comparable electronic structures and steric environments, they exhibit surprisingly different selectivity and efficiency in bulk electrolysis experiments. Rh2-phen2 is both more selective and efficient for the reduction of CO2 to HCOOH than H+ to H2 than Rh2-dpq2. The difference in catalytic activity between the two complexes is attributed to the greater electron density closer to the dirhodium core upon reduction of the diimine ligand in Rh2-phen2 as compared to Rh2-dpq2. In Rh2-dpq2, the dpq-based reduction is expected to be mainly localized at the distal pyrazine unit and to exert a less pronounced effect on subsequent reactivity taking place at the dirhodium core. In addition, the reduction of the dpq ligand in Rh2-dpq2 is followed by protonation of the nitrogen atoms on the pyrazine unit, thus reducing its ability to store and then supply a redox equivalent required for catalysis at the dirhodium core.

Its high-value fruit, vegetable, and nut crops rely on surface water imports from a vast network of reservoirs and canals as well as groundwater, which has been substantially overdrafted to support irrigation. The region has undergone a shift to perennial (tree and vine) crops in recent decades, which has increased water demand amid a series of severe droughts and emerging regulations on groundwater pumping. This study quantifies the expansion of perennial crops in the Tulare Lake Basin, the southern region of the Central Valley with limited natural water availability. A gridded crop type dataset is compiled on a 1 mi2 spatial resolution from a historical database of pesticide permits over the period 1974-2016 and validated against aggregated county-level data. This spatial dataset is then analyzed by irrigation district, the primary spatial scale at which surface water supplies are determined, to identify trends in planting decisions and agricultural water demand over time. Perennial crop acreage has nearly tripled over this period, and currently accounts for roughly 60% of planted area and 80% of annual revenue. These trends show little relationship with water availability and have been driven primarily by market demand. From this data, we focus on the increasing minimum irrigation needs each year to sustain perennial crops. Results indicate that under a range of plausible future regulations on groundwater pumping ranging from 10% to 50%, water supplies may fail to consistently meet demands, increasing losses by up to 30% of annual revenues. More broadly, the datasets developed in this work will support the development of dynamic models of the integrated water-agriculture system under uncertain climate and regulatory changes to understand the combined impacts of water supply shortages and intensifying irrigation demand. © 2019 The Author(s).

This is of particular importance when considering that fully-closed contemporary shopping centres constitute high-energy consuming spaces during the cooling period, in hot climates. The present study deals with the thermal behaviour of shopping arcades, a ‘traditional’ bioclimatic urban feature, in the hot and dry climate of Cyprus, by means of on-site air temperature recordings. The aim of this research is the bi-seasonal thermal performance assessment of this semi-open space, so as to inform energy retrofitting practices and promote bioclimatism in contemporary designs. The research shows that arcades were designed mainly to address the hot climatic conditions of the island. The sample tested achieved a significant daytime cool island up to 4.4K, during the cooling period. The best performance was achieved in arcades which presented minimum openings to envelope areas. In contrast, a daytime air temperature reduction which reached 2.1K, was observed in arcades during the heating period, indicating a negative thermal effect.

Following the nuclear disaster, which lead to a shortage of energy, the government of Japan enacted new policy measures to redefine its energy-mix after its earlier commitment to the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009 to reduce greenhouse gas emission by 25% from 1990 levels by 2020. In 2015, Japan ratified the Paris Accord and set a national greenhouse gas reduction goal - 26% below 2013 levels by 2030. To meet this requirement, Japan needs to restructure its current electricity consumption by identifying the optimal demand of electricity by households, commercial buildings, and public utilities. This calls for public infrastructures to manage their electricity consumption efficiently by adopting appropriate electricity conservation methods using precision monitoring systems. To support the policy of the government of Japan toward conservation of energy, in this paper, we outline the energy demand of a public utility system, namely a wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, and based on the data obtained using an innovative information and communication technology (ICT) tool. Using the monitored data, we further predict the electricity demand for each process of the WWTP using a Markov switching model. These models have high repeatability of monitoring results for each process according to various indices. In our results, all R2 values were more than 0.8; mean absolute percentage error values were under 10% for total electricity consumption and the water treatment process, and the relative root mean square error rate of each process was under 20%. Based on the results, we developed a future electricity consumption prediction model for WWTP total electricity consumption and the consumption of each process. The study emphasizes the need for an innovative ICT and advanced analysis system for supporting the governance of public facilities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electricity consumption prediction; Energy management system; Energy monitoring; Information and communication technology; Markov switching model; Wastewater treatment plant","Disasters; Electric power utilization; Energy management; Energy management systems; Forecasting; Greenhouse gases; Information management; Mean square error; Monitoring; Office buildings; Public policy; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Electricity-consumption; Energy monitoring; Information and Communication Technologies; Markov switching models; Wastewater treatment plants; Data communication systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067619268

The purpose of this paper is to assess people’s protective practices for inhalable particulate matter and its significant determinants such as general characteristics, knowledge and attitude among residents of an urban residential area, Dhaka, Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: This cross-sectional study was conducted by systematic random sampling. A total of 424 people, who lived in that area for not less than two years before the survey, were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. ?2 and Fisher’s exact test were used to analyze the data. Findings: Only a small proportion of respondents had high practice level. In addition, a little more than half has high level of knowledge about inhalable particulate matter, its adverse health effects and protective practices and almost 70 percent had high level of attitude toward air pollution. The protective practices for small inhalable particulate matter was significantly associated with age, educational level, occupation, knowledge and attitude toward small inhalable particulate matter, its adverse health effects and protective measures. Originality/value: A good level of knowledge about the prevailing air pollution and related health risks can be crucial to develop more focused attempt at changing the current situation with public participation. The environmental experts and health volunteer should disseminate precise and adequate information about long-term health hazards of particulate matter and measures of exposure prevention to improve the protective practices. © 2019, Sharmin Majumder, Tanasri Sihabut and Md Golam Saroar.","Air pollution; Bangladesh; Particulate matter; Protective practices","adult; age; air pollution; article; Bangladesh; cross-sectional study; female; health hazard; human; human experiment; male; occupation; particulate matter; residential area; structured questionnaire; urban population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074159318

Nevertheless, the performance of state-of-the-art Ni-cermet supported SOEC is limited by the interfacial polarization resistance. This study presents a simple approach to minimize the cathodic polarization resistances by reducing its thickness. The effect of cathode thickness on the electrochemical performance of SOECs for CO2/H2O co-electrolysis are investigated at 750-850 °C for variable reactant gas composition. Electrochemical measurements like current density-voltage (i-V) curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) are performed to characterize the performances of the cells. Impedance spectra are recorded under open circuit voltage (OCV) and polarization (1.4 V) to deeply study the influence of cathode thickness on polarization loss processes. The EIS results confirm that when reducing the cathode thickness, the cathode activation polarization is slightly decreased, whereas, the concentration polarization is significantly reduced, improving the reactant gas diffusion and the performance of SOEC. A similar effect is observed by increasing the CO2 mole fraction in the feed. Furthermore, the variation of cathode thickness and gas composition greatly affected the cell performance at high temperature, due to large reactants utilization. The results reveal that SOEC performance for co-electrolysis of CO2/H2O could considerably be improved by reducing the cathode thickness and improving the transport processes within the fuel-electrode. These results aid the optimization of cell design to improve the gaseous transport to the electrode/electrolyte interface and enhance the performance of SOEC for CO2/H2O reduction. © 2019 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Cathode thickness; Concentration polarization; Electrolysis; Impedance; Interfacial polarization","Carbon dioxide; Cathodes; Cathodic polarization; Conversion efficiency; Electric impedance; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrolysis; Open circuit voltage; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Synthetic fuels; Cathode thickness; Cathodic polarization resistances; Concentration polarization; Electrochemical measurements; Electrochemical performance; Electrode/electrolyte interfaces; Interfacial polarization; Interfacial polarization resistance; Regenerative fuel cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066755553

For the study of spatial and temporal variability of rainfall, several indexes have been developed. The Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) that only involves recorded rainfall data has been used as a tool for climatic zone classification and a drought indicator. Then, the aims of the present study were: 1) to cluster monthly precipitation time series into groups that represent regions under the basis of similar precipitation regimes, 2) to compute regional SPI’s using all the members (time series) of each cluster, and 3) to estimate trends of the regional SPI’s. The cluster analysis approach was used to identify four groups of monthly precipitation time series that represent regions of similar precipitation regimes. Afterwards, regional SPI’s were estimated using all the members of each cluster. Finally, four regional SPI trends were estimated by means of the Mann-Kendall trend test and Sen’s slope estimator. Estimated decreasing SPI trends imply prevail of negative values at the end of the study period (1964-2014), which indicate less than median precipitation in the entire Zacatecas state territory. For instance, SPI at 12-month time scale Sen’s slope values were -0.17 and -0.18 for the wet and dry seasons, respectively in the Semi-desert region. Thus, the evidenced trends may be having influence on the availability of surface water, groundwater levels and aquifers recharge in the near future. So, it is imperative to adjust inhabitants’ activities according to design planned climate change adaptation strategies. © The Authors.

We focus on the city's local climate change adaptation policies, and in particular the role of urban and greenspace planning in facilitating adaptation actions within Fukuoka. Fukuoka is a humid subtropical city which is currently experiencing significant population and economic growth. It has also made comparatively rigorous advances in climate adaptation, in a country context where local governments have been criticised for focusing more on mitigation. Fukuoka hence may yield lessons for other rapidly urbanising subtropical Asian cities. We illustrate that Fukuoka has a long tradition of science-policy connection towards the creation of a liveable urban environment. This creates a favourable research and policy infrastructure for adaptation, in particular mitigation of heat risk. This is evidenced in consideration of climate issues within the city's greenspace plans since the 1990s, and in an extensive body of underpinning applied research from local institutions into urban thermal environments in particular. Fukuoka's green terraced ACROS building has come to symbolise adaptation via the built environment, and has been followed by the emergence of further green roofs and through citizen and private sector involvement in smaller-scale greening actions. We caution that challenges remain around connecting different sections of local governments, and in maintaining climate and environmental imperatives in the face of ongoing development and expansion pressures. © 2019 The Authors","Climate change adaptation; Fukuoka; Urban climate change governance; Urban greenspace; Urban planning","adaptive management; climate change; environmental policy; greenspace; local government; policy approach; policy implementation; urban area; urban planning; Fukuoka [Fukuoka (PRF)]; Fukuoka [Kyushu]; Japan; Kyushu",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066490250

With this tremendous production of cement, the extensively used cement packaging embodies significant carbon dioxide emissions. However, this has scarcely been investigated. This paper presents the first investigation into three types of cement packaging in China using the life cycle assessment methodology. The carbon dioxide emissions in each production phase of cement packaging were calculated and compared to the emissions in the western, middle, and eastern regions in China. The results show that in the production phase, the consumption of electricity accounted for the highest proportion of total carbon dioxide emissions (23.39-35.14%), followed by the consumption of polypropylene-based material (23.39%). From a packaging perspective, laminated plastic woven bags emitted the most carbon dioxide (0.637 kg/bag), followed by paper-plastic composite bags (0.536 kg/bag) and paper bags (0.022 kg/bag). In regional terms, the western region emitted the most carbon dioxide (3.06 million tons) compared with the eastern (2.01 million tons) and middle (1.81 million tons) regions due to the low bulk rate. Our findings indicate that using paper-plastic composite bags instead of laminated plastic woven bags and using recycled materials instead of new materials in certain production phases can considerably reduce the environmental impacts of cement packaging. The government should encourage the use of non-coal energy power generation for the production phase. Further improvements could focus on the use of bulk cement instead of packaged cement. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon dioxide emission; Carbon emissions reduction; Cement packaging; Life cycle assessment","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; composite; electricity; emission control; energy use; environmental impact; life cycle analysis; state role",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073945977

This is the first paper to investigate the factors that can mitigate carbon-dioxide (CO2) intensity and further assess CMRBS in China based on a household scale via decomposition analysis. The core findings of this study reveal that: (1) Three types of housing economic indicators and the final emission factor significantly contributed to the decrease in CO2 intensity in the residential building sector. In addition, the CMRBS from 2001 to 2016 was 1816.99 MtCO2, and the average mitigation intensity during this period was 266.12 kgCO2·(household·year)−1. (2) Ridge regression indicated that the robustness of the decomposition approach was sufficient for achieving reliable results for the decomposition analysis and CMRBS assessment. (3) The energy-conservation and emission-mitigation strategy caused CMRBS to effectively increase and is the key to promoting a more significant emission mitigation in the future. Overall, this paper covers the CMRBS assessment gap in China, and the proposed assessment model can be regarded as a reference for other countries and cities for measuring the retrospective CO2 mitigation effect in residential buildings. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 intensity; CO2 mitigation; Decomposition analysis; Emission mitigation strategy; Residential building; Ridge regression","Housing; Regression analysis; Service industry; CO2 intensity; CO2 mitigation; Decomposition analysis; Emission mitigation; Residential building; Ridge regression; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070917991

In light of the continuing reduction of anthropogenic emissions in China, the underlying mechanisms for the occurrences of these regional extreme ozone episodes are elucidated from two perspectives: meteorology and biogenic emissions. The significant positive correlation between MDA8 ozone and temperature, which is amplified during heat waves concomitant with stagnant air and no precipitation, supports the crucial role of meteorology in driving high ozone concentrations. We also find that biogenic emissions are enhanced due to factors previously not considered. During the heavy ozone pollution episodes in June 2017, biogenic emissions driven by high vapor pressure deficit (VPD), land cover change and urban landscape yield an extra mean MDA8 ozone of 3.08, 2.79 and 4.74 ppbv, respectively, over the NCP, which together contribute as much to MDA8 ozone as biogenic emissions simulated using the land cover of 2003 and ignoring VPD and urban landscape. In Beijing, the biogenic emission increase due to urban landscape has a comparable effect on MDA8 ozone to the combined effect of high VPD and land cover change between 2003 and 2016. In light of the large effect of urban landscape on biogenic emission and the subsequent ozone formation, the types of trees may be cautiously selected to take into account of the biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emission during the afforestation of cities. This study highlights the vital contributions of heat waves, land cover change and urbanization to the occurrence of extreme ozone episodes, with significant implications for ozone pollution control in a future when heat wave frequency and intensity are projected to increase under global warming. © 2019 Author(s).",,"anthropogenic source; biogenic emission; concentration (composition); heat wave; land cover; ozone; pollution control; summer; urbanization; China; North China Plain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073023603

To date, the effects of climate and geographical factors on plant metabolome largely remain open for worldwide and local investigations. In this study, we designed field experiments with tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) in India versus USA and used untargeted metabolomics to understand the association of two weather factors and two different continental locations with respect to tobacco metabolism. Field research stations in Oxford, North Carolina, USA, and Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh India were selected to grow a commercial tobacco genotype (K326) for 2 years. Plant growth, field management, and leaf curing followed protocols standardized for tobacco cultivation. Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry based unbiased profiling annotated 171 non-polar and 225 polar metabolites from cured tobacco leaves. Principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) showed that two growing years and two field locations played primary and secondary roles affecting metabolite profiles, respectively. PCA and Pearson analysis, which used nicotine, 11 other groups of metabolites, two locations, temperatures, and precipitation, revealed that in North Carolina, temperature changes were positively associated with the profiles of sesquiterpenes, diterpenes, and triterpenes, but negatively associated with the profiles of nicotine, organic acids of tricarboxylic acid, and sugars; in addition, precipitation was positively associated with the profiles of triterpenes. In India, temperature was positively associated with the profiles of benzenes and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, but negatively associated with the profiles of amino acids and sugar. Further comparative analysis revealed that nicotine levels were affected by weather conditions, nevertheless, its trend in leaves was independent of two geographical locations and weather changes. All these findings suggested that climate and geographical variation significantly differentiated the tobacco metabolism. © Copyright © 2019 Ma, Gandra, Manoharlal, La Hovary and Xie.","climate change; continent; geography; metabolomics; nicotine; non-polar metabolite; polar metabolite; tobacco",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075249851

These walls are made principally from cellulose and hemicelluloses and are impregnated with lignin. Despite their importance as the main load bearing structure for plant growth, as well as their industrial importance as both a material and energy source, the precise arrangement of these constituents within the cell wall is not yet fully understood. We have adapted low temperature scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) for imaging the nanoscale architecture of angiosperm and gymnosperm cell walls in their native hydrated state. Our work confirms that cell wall macrofibrils, cylindrical structures with a diameter exceeding 10 nm, are a common feature of the native hardwood and softwood samples. We have observed these same structures in Arabidopsis thaliana secondary cell walls, enabling macrofibrils to be compared between mutant lines that are perturbed in cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin formation. Our analysis indicates that the macrofibrils in Arabidopsis cell walls are dependent upon the proper biosynthesis, or composed, of cellulose, xylan, and lignin. This study establishes that cryo-SEM is a useful additional approach for investigating the native nanoscale architecture and composition of hardwood and softwood secondary cell walls and demonstrates the applicability of Arabidopsis genetic resources to relate fibril structure with wall composition and biosynthesis. © Copyright © 2019 Lyczakowski, Bourdon, Terrett, Helariutta, Wightman and Dupree.","cell walls; cellulose; hardwood; lignin; macrofibrils; scanning electron microscopy; softwood; xylan",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074296675

Poland is the largest hard coal producer in the European Union with the Polish side of the Upper Silesian Coal Basin (USCB) as the main part of it. Emission estimates for CH4 from the USCB for individual coal mine ventilation shafts range between 0.03 and 20 kt a-1, amounting to a basin total of roughly 440 kt a-1 according to the European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register (E-PRTR, http://prtr.ec.europa.eu/, 2014). We mounted a ground-based, portable, sun-viewing FTS (Fourier transform spectrometer) on a truck for sampling coal mine ventilation plumes by driving cross-sectional stop-And-go patterns at 1 to 3 km from the exhaust shafts. Several of these transects allowed for estimation of CH4 emissions based on the observed enhancements of the column-Averaged dry-Air mole fractions of methane (XCH4) using a mass balance approach. Our resulting emission estimates range from 6-1 kt a-1 for a single shaft up to 109-33 kt a-1 for a subregion of the USCB, which is in broad agreement with the E-PRTR reports. Three wind lidars were deployed in the larger USCB region providing ancillary information about spatial and temporal variability of wind and turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer. Sensitivity studies show that, despite drawing from the three wind lidars, the uncertainty of the local wind dominates the uncertainty of the emission estimates, by far exceeding errors related to the XCH4 measurements themselves. Wind-related relative errors on the emission estimates typically amount to 20 %. © Author(s) 2019.",,"carbon emission; chemical mass balance; coal mine; coal production; coalbed methane; concentration (composition); European Union; lidar; methane; quantitative analysis; sampling; Silesian; spatial variation; turbulence; ventilation; Poland [Central Europe]; Upper Silesian Coal Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073055837

Effectiveness of local air pollution control measures is influenced by external forces such as atmospheric emission transport and interprovincial trade. However, there is lack of research on comparison of these two indicators and local indicators (e.g. per capita income and emissions) determines the responsibility allocation in pollution control. In this paper, cross-provincial air pollution is stimulated via atmospheric transport (atmospheric linkage indicator) based on Weather Research and Forecasting/Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extensions (WRF/CAMx) model. The air pollutants embodied in interprovincial trade (trade linkage indicator) was studied by using the latest multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model. This study revealed the significant influence of atmospheric transport on neighboring provinces. However, transport of trade-induced embodied emissions affects both neighboring areas and larger areas. According to aggregation analysis of these two indicators, in most provinces of China, direction of atmospheric transport contradicts to that of the trade-induced transport. These findings are used to analyze the rationality of regional differences in environmental tax rate in the new environmental protection tax law of China. By comparing the local and interregional linkage indicators, we found the current environment tax for air pollutants was mainly affected by per capita income whereas other environment and linkage indicators show little correlation. Therefore, we integrated environment and linkage indicators to propose adjusted provincial environment tax rates plan for air pollutants as a cost sharing mechanism. The results of this paper provide novel perspective for central government to adjust fairness environmental responsibility between provinces of China by tax policy. © 2019","Atmospheric transport; Environmental responsibility; Environmental tax; Trade transport","Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Commerce; Cost effectiveness; Environmental regulations; Health risks; Taxation; Weather forecasting; Air quality modeling; Atmospheric emission; Atmospheric transport; Cost sharing mechanism; Environmental responsibility; Environmental taxes; Integrated environment; Weather research and forecasting; Air pollution control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068407832

A large number of studies have been reported on the particulate matter retention capacities of plants, but few reports have been reported on the photosynthetic response of plants after particulate matter retention. In this study, we investigated the capacities of Rhododendron x pulchrum Sweet, Osmanthus fragrans Lour. and Photinia x fraseri Dress to retain atmospheric particles of different sizes and their photosynthetic gas exchange capacity in autumn and winter of 2017 at a freeway toll station and on a university campus. The results showed that the retention capacities of the three plant species were in the order R. pulchrum &gt; O. fragrans &gt; P. fraseri. The total suspended particles (TSPs) absorbed by R. pulchrum at the freeway toll station was the highest (autumn: 371.22 μg cm−2; winter: 177.11 μg cm−2), while the TSPs absorbed by P. fraseri at the campus was the lowest (autumn: 36.13 μg cm−2; winter: 41.50 μg cm−2). Plant surface retention (sPM) accounted for more than 60% of TSPs. Large particulate matter (10–100 μm) in sPM and wPM accounted for 52.17–9.60% and 45.36–72.20%, respectively. In winter, the proportion of fine particulate matter (0.2–2.5 μm) of sPM was significantly higher than that in autumn. Photosynthetic gas exchange capacity of plants, especially stomatal conductance (Gs), was significantly reduced by particulate pollution. There was a negative correlation between plant dust retention and photosynthetic gas exchange capacity. The amount of PM2.5 retained by plants was negatively correlated with the net photosynthetic rate (Pn). The photosynthetic gas exchange capacity of P. fraseri was the least affected under different particulate pollution levels, and this species was best able to adapt to growing in a more polluted environment. © 2019 The Authors","Osmanthus fragrans Lour.; Particulate matter; Photinia x fraseri Dress; Photosynthetic responses; Plant dust; Rhododendron x pulchrum Sweet",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072284049

For agricultural operations, one of the most important issues focuses on exhaust gases emissions released from tractors during fuel combustion. In particular, the increasing interest is in reducing the emissions of pollutants from exhaust gases to improve air quality. This review aims to analyse the recent scientific literature with respect to the solutions adopted to control exhaust gases emissions from agricultural tractors, and similar self-propelled machines, and to highlight the improvements about the possibilities of reducing these pollutants during field operations. Twenty-four studies were analysed. Of these, most researches focused on the more recent tractor engine designs (emission Stage 3A or Tier 3), and most of the instrumentation included power-take-off dynamometers, portable gas analysers, electronic control units for the monitoring of machinery parameters and fuel flowmeters. Some studies analysed the effects of different fuel blends (33.3%), while only few studies analysed the environmental burden of field operations considering the variation in exhaust gases (16.7%). The most important interventions that were found in these studies regarded the need for increasing fuel efficiency, introducing technical solutions with respect to the recent emission limits and, consequently, to reduce pollutant emissions, as well as introducing biofuel blends. This latter area can be less effective than the other solutions because the composition of blends can also increase some exhaust gases, mainly CO2 and NOX. © 2019 IAgrE","Biodiesel; Environmental sustainability; Exhaust gases emissions; Fuel consumption; Normative restrictions; Pollutants","Agriculture; Air quality; Biodiesel; Biofuels; Fuel consumption; Machine design; Power takeoffs; Sustainable development; Tractors (agricultural); Agricultural operations; Electronic control units; Environmental burdens; Environmental concerns; Environmental sustainability; Normative restrictions; Pollutants; Scientific literature; Exhaust gases",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070803164

Methodological challenges have impeded efforts to identify and track adaptation actors beyond the coarse scale of nation states. Yet, for effective adaptation to succeed, who do national governments need to engage, support and encourage? Using the UK as a case study, we conducted a systematic review of official government documents on climate adaptation, between 2006 and 2015, to understand which organisations are identified as key to future adaptation efforts and tracked the extent to which these organisations changed over time. Our unique longitudinal dataset found a very large number of organisations (n = 568). These organisations varied in size (small-medium enterprises to large multinationals), type (public, private and not-for-profit), sector (e.g. water, energy, transport and health), scale (local, national and international), and roles and responsibilities (policymaking, decision-making, knowledge production, retail). Importantly, our findings reveal a mismatch between official government policies that repeatedly call on private organisations to drive adaptation, on the one hand, and a clear dominance of the public sector on the other hand. Yet, the capacity of organisations to fulfil the roles and responsibilities assigned to them, particularly in the public sector, is diminishing. Unless addressed, climate adaptation actions could be assigned to those either unable, or unwilling, to implement them. © 2019, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Climate change; Organisations; Public sector; Tracking",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070989568

RDM of food raises opportunities and questions around the local nexus of food, energy and water. Considering these together can provide opportunities for rationalising resource utilisation, production, and consumption while contributing to shared prosperity between business, society and natural ecosystems. This paper concentrates on the energy–food aspects of the nexus for RDM by focusing on the case study of bread manufacturing and transportation in the UK. A detailed analysis of the energy requirements and environmental impacts of centralised bread production and transportation compared with localised options for re-distributed bread manufacturing is undertaken. This is achieved by building on existing literature and developing a series of bread-energy system configurations to model energy usage and green-house gas (GHG) emissions at the large (centralised), medium and small scales. Results from the analysis indicate that energy use and emissions can in some instances increase as a result of losing economies of scale through downscaling bread manufacturing. However, the analysis shows that overall energy use and emissions along the bread supply chain are dominated by transportation stages. Thus, RDM opens up new opportunities for reductions in overall energy consumption and emissions, for example by using low carbon vehicles for the transportation of bread and flour at the medium and small scales. Major energy use and emission reductions could also be achieved by reducing car usage if more consumers buy in local bakeries. The configurations also consider energy use for various bread wastage conditions. Assuming that buying more frequently in local bakeries only the bread that is consumed helps avoiding bread wastage, this would lead to reduced bread purchasing and bread manufacturing, which translates to reductions in energy use and emissions in the modelled configurations. Existing data demonstrate that there is a wide diversity across different manufacturing sites in the energy use and associated emissions per loaf of bread produced. The study highlights the opportunities for improvement in the sector if plant move towards the best available manufacturing technologies and practices, and this may be more practical for smaller scale operations. Two hypothetical bread production scenarios show that a greater share of the UK's bread being produced locally could result in a reduction in overall energy consumption and emissions. © 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Bread; Emissions; Re-distributed manufacturing; Water–energy–food nexus",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067236088

Results show a wide range of possible LSMP types over a 37-year period of study. LSMP type variability can be summarized as a spectrum from patterns dominated by positive SLP and Z500 anomalies with a poleward displacement of the strongest 250 hPa winds, to patterns dominated by similar structures but with anomalies of opposite sign. The LSMPs found are connected with lower tropospheric temperature and wind, precipitation, and the frequency of atmospheric rivers (ARs). This highlights LSMPs more closely associated with anomalous and potentially impactful surface meteorology. Results show ARs as primary drivers of heavy precipitation over some of the region and connect their occurrence to driving synoptic dynamics. Two important low frequency modes of climate variability, the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) and the El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), show some influence on the frequency of LSMP type, with the SAM more directly related to LSMP type modulation than ENSO. This comprehensive climatology of synoptic variability across southern South America has potential to aid in a mechanistic approach to studying climate change projections of temperature, precipitation, and AR frequency in climate models. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Atmospheric rivers; South America; Synoptic climatology","atmospheric circulation; climate change; diurnal variation; geopotential; precipitation (climatology); sea level pressure; synoptic meteorology; wind velocity; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064568121

Unignited, they have environmental impacts. This is particularly the case for methane leaks due to a significant Global Warming Potential (GWP). Since gas leak rates may span several orders of magnitude, that is, from leaks associated with potential major accidents to fugitive emissions on the order of 10-6 kg/s, it has been difficult to organize the leaks in an all-inclusive leak categorization model. The motivation for the present study was to develop a simple logarithmic table based on an existing consequence matrix for safety related incidents extended to include non-safety related fugitive emissions. An evaluation sheet was also developed as a guide for immediate risk evaluations when new leaks are identified. The leak rate table and evaluation guide were tested in the field at five land-based oil and gas facilities during Optical Gas Inspection (OGI) campaigns. It is demonstrated how the suggested concept can be used for presenting and analysing detected leaks to assist in Leak Detection and Repair (LDAR) programs. The novel categorization table was proven valuable in prioritizing repair of ""super-emitter"" components rather than the numerous minor fugitive emissions detected by OGI cameras, which contribute little to the accumulated emissions. The study was limited to five land based oil and gas facilities in Norway. However, as the results regarding leak rate distribution and ""super-emitter"" contributions mirror studies from other regions, the methodology should be generally applicable. To emphasize environmental impact, it is suggested to include leaking gas GWP in future research on the categorization model, that is, not base prioritization solely on leak rates. Research on OGI campaign frequency is recommended since frequent coarse campaigns may give an improved cost benefit ratio. © 2019 by the authors.","Fugitive emissions; Hydrocarbon leaks; Leak detection and repair (LDAR); Optical Gas Imaging (OGI)","Accident prevention; Cost benefit analysis; Environmental impact; Explosions; Gas industry; Global warming; Leak detection; Repair; Fugitive emissions; Global warming potential; Hydrocarbon leaks; Leak detection and repair; Leak rate distribution; Oil and Gas Industry; Optical gas imaging; Orders of magnitude; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075552793

In Latvia, energy efficiency policy goes along with energy-intensive consumer rights on energy taxation exemptions that should ensure their competitiveness. However, both policies are in some way contradictory and, in certain circumstances, when an energy-intensive company faces the risk to lose its status of being energy-intensive company, energy efficiency policy will fail as the company's willingness to become more efficient will be reduced. However, the peculiarities of the Latvian tax policy, whereby the right to receive the tax rebate is not available at the moment of consumption but post-factum, which does not provide full sustainability, may weaken company's willingness to maintain energy intensity above the threshold and provide tax refunds as an additional source to finance energy efficiency measures. © 2019 IEEE.","energy efficiency; energy intensity; energy taxation; system dynamic","Energy policy; Taxation; Consumer rights; Efficiency measure; Energy efficiency policies; Energy intensity; Energy intensive companies; Energy intensive industries; Energy intensive manufacturing; European Union Directive; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084338890

While major successes have been achieved in improving health in recent decades, threats from the environment may undermine these gains, particularly among vulnerable populations and communities. In this article, we review the rationale for governments to invest in environmental Common Goods for Health (CGH) and identify functions that qualify as such, including interventions to improve air quality, develop sustainable food systems, preserve biodiversity, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and encourage carbon sinks. Exploratory empirical analyses reveal that public spending on environmental goods does not crowd out public spending on health. Additionally, we find that improved governance is associated with better performance in environmental health outcomes, while the degrees of people’s participation in the political system together with voice and accountability are positively associated with performance in ambient air quality and biodiversity/habitat. We provide a list of functions that should be prioritized by governments across different sectors, and present preliminary costing of environmental CGH. As shown by the costing estimates presented here, these actions need not be especially expensive. Indeed, they are potentially cost-saving. The paper concludes with case examples of national governments that have successfully prioritized and financed environmental CGH. Because societal preferences may vary across time, government leaders seeking to protect the health of future generations must look beyond electoral cycles to enact policies that protect the environment and finance environmental CGH. © 2019, Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC. © 2019, © 2019 World Health Organization.","common goods for health; ecosystem services; environmental health; planetary health; public financing","economics; environmental health; environmental protection; financial management; government; human; procedures; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Health; Financing, Government; Government Programs; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074711223

In this study, a five year (2013–2017) online observation was conducted in Beijing and the chemical evolution pattern of FPEG events was analyzed to understand its formation mechanism. A total of 132 FPEG events were identified, and steadily decreased from 39 events in 2013 to 19 events in 2017. More than 70% of the FPEG events occurred in winter and autumn, which coincides with adverse weather conditions and enhanced primary emissions. Organic matter (OM) was the dominated components (~30%) in PM2.5, but it only accounted for 10% of total FPEG events as a driven factor, because its contribution usually decreased when the FPEG events developed. In contrast, the secondary inorganic species were the dominated driven factors, and sulfate-driven events accounted &gt;50%. During the period of 2013–2017, the contribution from regional sources decreased significantly mainly due to the reduction of emissions from regional sources, while the contribution from local sources remained largely unchanged, indicating that the local secondary transformation played a leading role in promoting the FPEG events. The low nitrogen oxidation rates (NOR, 0.12 ± 0.07) and the weak increase trend of NOR with elevated RH were observed, indicating the formation of which might be promoted by the homogenous reaction between HNO3 and NH3. In contrast, a significant increase in sulfur oxidation rate (SOR, 0.50 ± 0.19) was observed when RH &gt; 50%, suggesting enhanced heterogeneous oxidation of SO2 in FPEG events.

However, it is often difficult to estimate the attainable yields in smallholder farm agriculture. In this study, we estimated the yield gaps in irrigated wheat in the Hebei Province in China using data from farmer surveys and crop modeling. The EPIC (Environment Policy Integrated Climate) model was calibrated and evaluated for high-yielding wheat experiments in Hebei Province to estimate the Yp at the county level. The model was run for 10 yr (2005–2014) using county-level weather data, and the area-weighted average model-based estimate of Yp was 9.93 Mg ha–1 across 116 counties in Hebei Province, which was higher than the estimate of approximately 9.0 Mg ha–1 that was reported in previous studies. The attainable yield potential (Ya) during this period was defined as the mean yield of the top 5% of farmers, and the actual farm yield (Yf) in these counties was calculated based on a survey of 385,167 farmers. The area-weighted average Yf was 6.47 Mg ha–1, corresponding to 65.2% of the model-based estimate of Yp. The total yield gap was high at 3.46 Mg ha–1. The top-producing farmers achieved only 77% of the model-based Yp, which indicates that closing the yield gap remains a challenge. In the future, investments should be made in technology transfer for irrigated wheat production in China. © 2019 The author(s).",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073433632

We adopt a global computable general equilibrium model assuming future energy efficiency improvement until 2040 follows historical trends at a regional level including the USA, European Union, Japan, Russia, China, India, and Brazil over the period of 1995–2009. Results show that the global GDP would increase by 1.3% from 2015 to 2040, without making any regions worse off, if energy efficiency in all economic activities other than energy production gradually reaches 10% higher in 2040 than a baseline scenario. However, economy-wide rebound effects on energy use accumulate over time and vary from 55 to 78% across regions in 2040. The additional energy efficiency improvement by the same percentage for fossil and non-fossil energy pushes a stronger downward pressure on fossil fuel prices than on renewable prices, thus discouraging the share of renewables in the energy mix. We conclude that energy efficiency policy needs to be aligned with renewable and climate targets to control its rebound effect on energy use and related emissions. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Climate mitigation; Economic growth; Energy efficiency; Macroeconomic impacts; Rebound effect","Costs; Economic analysis; Fossil fuels; Climate mitigations; Computable general equilibrium model; Economic growths; Energy efficiency improvements; Energy efficiency policies; General equilibrium; Macroeconomic impact; Rebound effect; Energy efficiency; alternative energy; economic growth; economic impact; energy efficiency; energy policy; general equilibrium analysis; macroeconomics; productivity; Brazil; China; Europe; India; Japan; Russian Federation; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069173515

The accumulation of toxic carbonylated proteins might be one of the onsets of pathogenesis in hippocampal aging or neurodegeneration. Enormous evidence indicates that regular aerobic exercise might alleviate the dysfunction of carbonylated proteins, but the adaptational mechanisms in response to exercise are unclear. Objective: This study explored the carbonyl stress mechanism in the hippocampus using proteomics and the role of calmodulin-dependent protein kinases (CAMK)-AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)-Beclin1 signaling pathways in alleviating aging or improving function with regular aerobic exercise. Methods: Twenty-four healthy 13-month-old male Sprague-Dawley rats (average 693.21 ± 68.85 g) were randomly divided into middle-aged sedentary control group (M-SED, n = 12) and middle-aged aerobic exercise runner group (M-EX, n = 12). The M-EX group participated in regular aerobic exercise - treadmill running - with exercise intensity increasing gradually from 50-55% to 65-70% of maximum oxygen consumption (V-O2max) over 10 weeks. The targeted proteins of oxidative modification were profiled by avidin magnetic beads and electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ESI-Q-TOF-MS). Western blots were used to test for molecular targets. Results: Regular aerobic exercise restores the intersessional habituation and rescues the hippocampus morphological structure in middle-aged rats. -ESI-Q-TOF-MS screened 56 carbonylated proteins only found in M-SED and 16 carbonylated proteins only found in M-EX, indicating aerobic exercise decreased carbonyl stress. Intriguingly, Ca2+/CAMK II alpha (CAMKIIα) was carbonylated only in the M-SED group at the oxidative modification site of 4-hydroxynonenal adducts, while regular aerobic exercise alleviated CAMKIIα carbonylation. Regular aerobic exercise significantly increased the expression and phosphorylated, active levels of CAMKIIα and AMPKα1. It also upregulated the expression of Beclin1 and microtubule-associated protein1-light chain 3 in the hippocampus. Conclusion: Quantification of CAMKIIα carbonylation may be a potential biomarker of the hippocampal senescence. Additionally, regular aerobic exercise-induced autophagy via the activation of CAMK-AMPK-Beclin1 signaling pathway may mitigate the hippocampal neurodegeneration or pathological changes by alleviating protein carbonylation (carbonyl stress). © 2019 S.

The rhombic dodecahedra Cu2O/rGO exhibits the highest methanol yield (355.3 μmol g-1cat) which is ca. 4.1-80.8 times superior to cubic, octahedral Cu2O/rGO and CuO/rGO after 20 h of visible light illumination. The enhanced performance may be due to the unique rhombic dodecahedra structure with less band bending of conduction and valence bands which decrease the energy barrier for the transfer of photogenerated electrons to the surface. The incorporation of rGO should assist the transfer of photogenerated electrons from conduction band of Cu2O. The positively charged dodecahedra Cu2O/rGO may also increase the adsorption of carbonate anions from dissolution of CO2 gas.

In our previous study, we found that chicken cytochrome P450 1A5 (CYP1A5) can be significantly induced by T-2 toxin in chicken primary hepatocytes and catalyze T-2 toxin into a more toxic product, 3′-OH-T-2. Here, we showed that T-2 toxin also induced the expression of CYP1A5 in LMH cells at both the mRNA and protein levels, and this can be strongly inhibited by both resveratrol and siRNA targeting the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), indicating the involvement of AhR in T-2 toxin-induced transcriptional activation of CYP1A5. We further showed that T-2 toxin induced the expression of AhR and promoted the translocation of AhR into the nucleus as well as its binding to the proximal xenobiotic-responsive element (XRE) in the 5′-flanking region of CYP1A5, which mediates both the basal expression and the transcriptional activation of CYP1A5. Interestingly, CYP1A5 induction mediated by AhR enhances the cytotoxicity of T-2 toxin by reducing cell viability, activating oxidative stress and inducing DNA damage as well as apoptosis. Our findings provide novel insight into T-2 toxin-induced gene expression and cytotoxicity and may provide a novel target to reduce latent harm to chickens. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","AhR; CYP1A5; Cytotoxicity; T-2 Toxin; Transcriptional regulation","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; cytochrome P450 1A; cytochrome P450 1A5; messenger RNA; resveratrol; small interfering RNA; T 2 toxin; unclassified drug; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; cytochrome P450; T 2 toxin; animal cell; apoptosis; Article; cell viability; chicken; controlled study; cytotoxicity; deletion mutant; DNA damage; gene expression; liver cell; LMH cell line; nonhuman; oxidative stress; priority journal; transcription initiation; animal; cell line; cell survival; classification; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; Animals; Cell Line; Cell Survival; Chickens; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Gene Expression Regulation; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; T-2 Toxin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069939979

Carbon inputs in the soil come from plant residues and root exudates, which are further transformed by microorganisms and stored in the long term.

We found that over the three sites litter production was controlled by climatic factors, soil properties, and forest stand characteristics, whereas decay rates were mainly controlled by microbial community structure and soil stoichiometry. For fine roots, production differed among sites, and higher production was consistently observed in the top soil layers compared to deep soil, although the root distribution along the soil profile differed among sites. Fine-root decay rates were mainly controlled by fine-root stoichiometric characteristics. This article emphasizes the complexity of fine-root dynamics even for a single species. Environmental drivers impact on both production and decay, and we suggest performing manipulative field experiments to better identify the mechanisms involved in soil carbon cycling. © Copyright © 2019 Liu, Yang, Wang, Shen, Janssens, Guenet and Xiao.","fine roots; Korean pine; latitudinal gradient; litter decomposition; soil organic carbon",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075855488

This study aimed to investigate the association between short-term PM2.5 exposure and psychiatric emergency events, and further explored the variation by age, sex and seasonal patterns, which have been suggested to be associated with both psychiatric risk and pollutant toxicity. Methods: We used time-series analysis to investigate the association between short-term exposure of PM2.5 and emergency ambulance dispatches for psychiatric emergencies (EPE) (n = 158634) in Beijing, one of the top polluted cities in China during the study period between 2008 and 2014. Stratified analyses were conducted to examine the effects of age, sex and seasonal pattern. Results: Every 10 μg/m3 increase of the PM2.5 concentration was associated with a 0.12% increase of the same-day overall EPE (95% CI: 0.03–0.22%, p = 0.013) and a 0.12% increase of the suicide-related EPE at lag 2 (95%CI: 0.01–0.24%, p = 0.041). The associations remained when adjusted for sunlight duration. An age effect was observed where children (age &lt;18) showed a higher risk of suicide-related EPE after PM2.5 exposure compared to adults (18 ≤ age≤64). We did not observe evidence of effect modification by sex and season based on the results of stratified analysis. Conclusions: We found a positive association between acute PM2.5 exposure and increased psychiatric emergency presentations indicated by emergency ambulance dispatches data. Children were more vulnerable and might develop psychiatric problems including those leading to suicide. Public awareness of the health risks of PM2.5 is important to strengthen current efforts to reduce emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Air pollution; Emergency ambulance dispatches (EAD); PM2.5; Psychiatric emergency; Suicide","ambient air; hospital sector; mental health; particle size; particulate matter; seasonality; suicide; time series analysis; toxicity test; adolescent; adult; aged; air pollutant; ambulance; Article; child; female; health hazard; human; infant; male; middle aged; particulate matter; preschool child; priority journal; psychiatric emergency; school child; seasonal variation; suicide; sunlight; time series analysis; urban area; young adult; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; emergency; environmental exposure; mental disease; particulate matter; Beijing [China]; China; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Ambulances; Beijing; Child; China; Cities; Emergencies; Environmental Exposure; Humans; Mental Disorders; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070224125

However, there is still no consensus on whether China's situation is consistent with the abovementioned hypotheses. Therefore, to investigate whether China's development aligns with the Environmental Kuznets Curve and Pollution Haven hypotheses, this study considered provincial panel data from 1996 to 2015 and used the fixed effects panel data partially linear additive model, which integrates economic growth and foreign direct investment into the same framework, to investigate their impact on carbon emissions. The results revealed that there exists a reverse U-shape relationship between economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions, and an inverted N-shaped relationship between foreign direct investment and carbon dioxide emissions. Moreover, the results revealed that energy consumption has an accelerating effect on the production pace of carbon dioxide emissions. The upgrading of industrial infrastructure, technology diffusion, and trade liberalization can contribute to the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. Additionally, this study proposes the following future research directions. First, considering the regional differences in China, the conclusions of this study should be re-examined by grouping different regions. Secondly, the formation mechanism of the inverted N-type relationship between foreign direct investment and carbon emissions is also an issue that requires further discussion.

However, there are also several cities that restrict trucks from operating at night to meet the noise regulation. Uncertainty exists in terms of the environmental impact of these truck shifting programs. On one hand, shifting trucks from peak hours can reduce the total emissions by easing congestion, while the impact of moving truck emissions to nighttime will be interacted with more stable atmospheric boundary layer and lower mixing height, increasing the nighttime concentration. On the other hand, shifting trucks from the night to day avoids the emissions with a stable atmosphere at night, while worsening traffic condition at daytime, and hence increasing the total emissions. The research presents a realistic case study and explores a comparative analysis of PM2.5 concentration originated from a hypothetical freeway corridor and concentrated at a hospital located at 200-m far away from the corridor by implementing four truck strategies applied under various scenarios with traffic demands and heavy-duty trucks (HDTs) proportions. Two meteorological conditions are also considered, with one representing coast region and unstable atmospheric boundary layer, and thus good dispersion condition, and one inland region with a relatively stable atmospheric condition and bad dispersion condition. The results indicate that shifting trucks from peak-period to off-peak period is effective to reduce both emissions and 24-hr average concentrations in scenarios of high traffic demands and high truck proportions, in which the peak period traffic is congested and thus the benefits of reducing congestion and resultant emissions are quite large by altering freight trucks from peak period. It is also observed in the scenarios with lower-traffic demand where the traffic congestion is less severe (in this case, the throughput is less than 75,000 vehicles per day on a three-lane freeway segment, and average speed is higher than 60 km/h), although shifting truck from night to day increase emissions by adding the shifted traffic demand at peak period, it decreases the average concentration by avoiding nighttime emissions. Such a benefit will be further amplified in the meteorological condition of low mixing height at night. Shifting trucks from daytime to nighttime is found to be the strategy that contributes to the highest average PM2.5 concentration, although sometimes the total emissions are minimized. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Emissions; Mixing height; Nighttime operation; PM2.5 concentration; Truck shifting strategy","Atmospheric boundary layer; Automobiles; Environmental impact; Mixing; Particulate emissions; Trucks; Atmospheric conditions; Average concentration; Meteorological condition; Mixing height; Nighttime operations; PM2.5 concentration; Shifting strategy; Stable atmospheric boundary layer; Traffic congestion; boundary layer; concentration (composition); diesel; environmental impact assessment; freight transport; mixing; motorway; particulate matter; traffic emission; article; boundary layer; case report; clinical article; environmental impact; height; meteorology; night; seashore; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069736109

However, the international community still lacks understanding of how to make a bridge between scientific research and SDGs. China has experienced 40 years of rapid economic growth and social development, which have imposed considerable challenges on sustainable development. Although many disciplines have made contributions to promoting sustainable development in China, how to bridge SDGs and scientific research is still not fully clear. In this paper, we review the contribution of geographers to this issue to provide references for further international efforts towards meeting the SDGs. We consider three aspects in particular: the sensitive process capture of regional responses and feedbacks to global change; the cognition and geographical solution of human–environment conflicts; and the mutual promotion of spatial governance and geographical practices. The contribution of geography as a discipline to the sustainable development of China is an epitome of geographers’ efforts over the world. The practices experienced in China show that geography has played an irreplaceable role in promoting sustainable development, and can deal effectively with the challenges posed to the academic community by SDGs. As a discipline, geography has been deeply integrated into sustainable development. In the future, geography should become a key discipline in integrating many disciplines involved in sustainable development studies, and provide real-time decision support systems for sustainable development by combining big data and artificial intelligence. © The Author(s) 2019.","climate change mitigation; geography; human–environment confliction; spatial governance; Sustainable development goals","artificial intelligence; climate change; decision support system; economic growth; environmental economics; environmental policy; governance approach; real time; research and development; sustainable development; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066875853

A comprehensive model framework integrating GAINS-China, GEOS-Chem, and IMED/HEL is established to investigate the impacts of various policies on air pollution and health effects. The model establishes a data interface between economic input/output data and the emission inventory of atmospheric pollutants in the BTH region. Based on in-depth analyses of pollutant emission standards, industrial structure, pollution-intensive industries, and emission intensities in BTH and Pearl River Delta, several scenarios are constructed to explore the effectiveness of policy pathways in improving air quality in the BTH region. These scenarios include two categories: the category of “Industrial Technology Upgrade Policy” scenarios that focuses on reducing the emission intensity of industries vs. that of “Industrial Structure Adjustment Policy” scenarios that focuses on adjusting the proportion of industrial value-added. Our results show that the policy path of industrial technology upgrading can be effective and feasible, while economic structure adjustment shows complex and mixed effectiveness. We also find that the proposed policies and measures will be efficient to reduce pollution of primary pollutants and fine particles, but may not effectively mitigate ambient ozone pollution. Ozone pollution is projected to become increasingly severe in BTH, placing a challenge to pollution mitigation strategies that requires further adjustments to address it.

The valorisation of high-rate energy- and phosphorus-rich sludge creates the opportunity for their combined recovery. This phosphate is present in a precipitated form in the sludge, and its release into the liquid phase is an important issue before recovery can be achieved. The objective of this research was to exploit the “unwanted” sulphate reduction process for the release of phosphate into the liquid phase during anaerobic digestion, thus, making it available for recovery. Two different treatments were considered, i.e., a control digester and a digester to which sulphate was added, each operated in triplicate for a period of 119 days. The control digester showed stable methane production at 628 ± 103 mL CH4 L−1 d−1, with a feedstock COD (chemical oxygen demand) conversion efficiency of 89.5 ± 14.6%. In contrast, the digester with sulphate addition showed a 29.9 ± 15.3% decrease in methane production, reaching an “inhibited steady state”, but phosphate release into the liquid phase increased to 58.7 ± 12.9% of total P, a factor 4.5 higher than the control digester.

This article draws on smoking relationships to clarify air pollution relationships. We analyzed cohort and population-based smoking studies and identified effects of latency and cumulative exposures. We found cogent relationships through longitudinal rather than cross-sectional analysis, thus involving historical data. We also considered passive smoking, occupational exposures, radon, and established carcinogens. We found stable nonsmoking LCM rates during periods of improving ambient air quality. We considered 59 cross-sectional studies of lung cancer and air pollution and found similar statistically significant relative risks for PM2.5, PM10, EC, NO2, SO2, SO2− 4, and O3, and minimal risks for benzo(alpha)pyrene and trace metals. Most air pollution studies did not consider latency, exposure duration, or temporal trends; none included estimates of smoking risks implied by their models. We conclude that while LCM studies of smoking, radon, and occupational exposures appropriately considered latency and cumulative exposures; ambient air quality studies have not. Lung cancer has a long memory and exposure histories are required. Effects of cumulative exposures after pollution abatement include substantially reduced risk estimates, delayed health benefits, inability to show accountability for the abatement. However, associations of lung cancer with ambient air pollution cannot be ruled out, especially for historic periods when much higher exposures persisted. Given the major reductions in air quality and smoking habits that have been realized since the Clean Air Act, new studies of LCM and air pollution, including smoking histories and exposure data decades before diagnosis, are needed.Highlights Lifetime cigarette consumption is a good predictor of lung cancer risk. The latent period for lung cancer ranges from about 10 to 30 y. Lung cancer risks for nonsmokers have been stable during the period when ambient air quality improved substantially. Risks of established airborne carcinogens may have been important in the past but not under current conditions. Radon can be important. Air pollution-lung cancer risks should be evaluated jointly with smoking risks but are sensitive to their accuracy. When cumulative exposures to conventional air pollutants are considered rather than concurrent, the applicable risk estimates may decrease by an order of magnitude and abatement benefits will not be readily apparent. Most of the recent cross-sectional studies of lung cancer and regulated air pollutants did not consider latency, duration of exposure, or established carcinogens and their findings have been misinterpreted. Effects of smoking on LCM are now well established as are the spatial distributions of ambient air pollution; however, linkages among the three parameters remain uncertain. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

We used a sustainable livelihood approach and Ostrom's design principles for managing commons, to assess how CF confers climate change adaptive capacity in two communities in Myanmar. Our findings indicate that CF provides tangible contributions to human and social capital, by increasing landless and female forest users' knowledge of forest management. However, CF has yet to enhance the physical, financial, and natural capital within these communities. The major challenges preventing the enhancement of socioeconomic benefits include limited community participation and weak institutional systems for monitoring and conflict resolution. We argue that CF increases community engagement in natural resource management, but in the absence of effective monitoring and decision-making, socioeconomic benefits to communities from CF programs may be limited. Our results elucidate important factors limiting the uptake and progress of CF as a viable climate change adaptation strategy in Southeast Asia, and indicate that comparative research is needed to better understand the factors that influence CF efficacy in forest- and natural resource-dependent communities globally. © 2019 Commonwealth Forestry Association.

Although long-term trends in the air or ambient temperature over China under global warming have been well studied in the literature, the changes in human-perceived wind chill conditions, especially under possible urbanization effects, are still not completely known. This paper investigates the changes of wind chill over China and quantifies the associated urbanization effect by examining nearly 2000 meteorological stations during 1961–2014 using the generalized additive model (GAM). Results show that the winter wind chill temperature (WCT) in China exhibits more prominent raising trends than the air temperature, i.e., 0.623 and 0.349 °C per decade, respectively. The wind speed (V) and wind chill days (WCD) decreased by 0.149 m/s and 1.970 days per decade, respectively. These trends become more substantial in densely populated and highly urbanized areas such as the North China Plain. The expansion of urban built-up area induces additional warming (reducing) to the increase (decrease) in WCT (WCD). On average, an increase from 0% to 100% in the urban fraction induced 0.290 ± 0.067 °C higher WCT (± denotes the 95% confidence interval), along with a reduction in V and WCD by 0.052 ± 0.014 m/s and 3.513 ± 0.387 days, respectively; whereas, the presence of the grassland and forest significantly diminishes the WCT and increases the WCD and surface V. It is expected that wind chill over China tends to be weakened under glocal warming and local urbanization in the near future. Our results have important implications for climate change mitigation, urban planning, landscape design, and air pollution abatement. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Generalized additive model; Human perceived temperature; Land use change; Urbanization effect; Wind chill","Additives; Climate change; Global warming; Land use; Temperature; Wind; Air pollution abatement; Climate change mitigation; Generalized additive model; Highly urbanized areas; Land-use change; Meteorological station; Perceived temperature; Urbanization effect; Climate models; climate change; land use change; perception; regression analysis; temperature effect; urbanization; wind velocity; winter; air pollution; air temperature; article; China; city planning; climate change; forest; grassland; human; landscape; quantitative analysis; urban area; urbanization; warming; wind speed; winter; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067551714

As a low-carbon economic instrument, carbon tax is generally considered to be an effective way to reduce CO2 emissions through raising energy cost, but whether it will promote the green total factor productivity (GTFP) of China's metallurgical industry is still unanswered. Under this background, this paper uses provincial panel data over years 2000–2015 to investigate the impact of carbon taxation on GTFP of metallurgical industry from the perspective of inter-fuel and inter-factor substitution. The lock-in mechanism is also incorporated in the three-stage estimation model to better reflect the asymmetric price response of factors and fuels. The results reveal that the slow marketization process of energy price and the rigid demand for energy in China's metallurgical industry hinder the substitution effect of energy. The implementation of carbon tax has limited effect on energy-saving and CO2 reduction in the metallurgical industry of China and levying a carbon tax has a negative effect on GTFP during the research period. Therefore, the government should not achieve CO2 reduction targets at the expense of green economic growth. GTFP is suggested to be considered in future assessment criteria in the process of transforming to low-carbon economy. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon tax; Green total factor productivity; Inter-fuel/inter-factor substitution; Metallurgical industry","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Fuels; Metallurgy; Metals; Productivity; Renewable energy resources; Taxation; Telecommunication industry; Carbon taxes; Factor substitutions; High energy consumption; Low-carbon economic; Low-carbon transitions; Metallurgical industry; Substitution effect; Total factor productivity; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067547490

The emission of GHGs has been an alarming issue in our world today which causes not only the rise of temperature but also disastrous natural disasters such as flood, hurricane, drought and many more. Like other developing countries, Malaysia have given its full support and cooperation in its attempt to achieve a sustainable development. In Malaysia, there are several policies and legislation developed to encourage sustainability in four major areas which are water and waste management, transportation, energy and building. The importance of higher education institutions such as universities should address the diverse needs of local societies and promote sustainability. Universities should also consider including sustainability into student’s education and program to promote the environmental issues which have been one of the highest concerns around the world. Therefore, the focus of this research is to analyze and reduce the carbon footprint for a sustainable campus.

However, only few studies included alpine grasslands and generally concluded that snowbeds, with a long snow cover duration and a short growing season, and windy ridges, with a short snow cover duration and strong winter frosts, are the most sensitive alpine grasslands. However, these habitats were mostly investigated in different regions, where local factors (e.g. nitrogen deposition, grazing) can co-vary with climate changes, potentially obscuring differences between habitats. Here, we focused on the Zermatt region (Swiss Alps) to investigate the impacts of climate change on snowbeds and windy ridges. Forty-three exhaustive historical plant inventories on windy ridges (acidophilic or basophilic) and 31 inventories in snowbeds (typical or wet) were repeated in quasi-permanent plots after approximately 23 years. Historical and recent records were compared with the Simpson index, Bray–Curtis dissimilarity, a PCA, ecological indicator values and the frequency and cover changes of species. There was a general increase in α-diversity and a decrease in β-diversity (homogenisation). Most of the new species in the plots were generalists from surrounding grasslands. The plant composition tended to be more thermophilous on acidophilic windy ridges and in typical snowbeds. The flora of acidophilic windy ridges became more similar to that of basophilic windy ridges and more eutrophic. We interpreted this as possibly arising from fertilisation by the aeolian dust deposition coming from the expanding glacial moraine in the valley. In snowbeds, the species indicated increasingly drier conditions, especially in wet snowbeds. Warming climate induces lower snowfall and earlier snowmelt, leading to a shorter snow cover duration. Hence, wet snowbeds are certainly among the most threatened plant communities by climate change in the Alps. © 2019, Swiss Botanical Society.","Elynion; Quasi-permanent plots; Salicion herbaceae; Snow cover; Switzerland; Temperature; Vegetation dynamics","acidophily; climate effect; eolian deposit; growing season; herb; ice ridge; new species; snow cover; temperature profile; vegetation cover; vegetation dynamics; wind forcing; Switzerland; Valais; Zermatt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072181215

In this study, the emissions of organophosphate ester flame retardants (OPEFRs) from customized polyisocyanurate foam materials were measured in 44-mL microchambers at 23, 35, and 55 °C. The values of Dm and Kma at different temperatures were determined. The results showed that the increase of temperature can significantly enhance the emissions of OPEFRs from the foam materials, and the emissions of OPEFRs were found to transfer from SVOC-type to volatile organic compound (VOC)-type with the increase of temperature.

This paper presents a review on coal-to-electricity policies into practice through summarizing government policies and practical investigation, including its planning, scope, funding, process, and technical types analysis. In addition, a prospect of coal-to-electricity project in northern China is also given. It is found that the coal-to-electricity project holds a meaningful contribution and promising potential of development given the urgent need for clean energy heating in large areas of northern China. Government financial subsidy is driving force and efficient technical types are carrier. It was further demonstrated that a large amount of government financial subsidy and the application of efficient technology will contribute to the implementation of coal-to-electricity project, which may provide reference for transition of other energy and low carbon policies into practice. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Such combustion regime offers reduction in pollutant emissions and improvements in efficiency. However, some phenomena like the relations between auto-ignition and flame propagation, local extinction and re-ignition are not easily detected by experimental analysis or through the inspection of CFD calculations. The advanced post-processing tools based on the theories of computational singular perturbation (CSP) and tangential stretching rate (TSR) are adopted to investigate the Large Eddy Simulation (LES) results of the JHC burner with different coflow oxygen levels. A topological characterization of the flowfield is achieved employing the local number of chemically exhausted modes, highlighting regions that share similar dynamical features. Strong chemical activity, denoted by a small number of exhausted modes, is found in the fuel/coflow mixing layer and, to a minor extent, in the coflow/air mixing layer, exhibiting correlation with the higher heat release rate zones. The analysis of the reactive layers with TSR suggests that the flame under MILD condition is initiated by auto-ignition. Moreover, the investigation of the TSR participation indices (PIs) mark the local extinction and re-ignition zone for the low oxygen level case, indicating that the lack of oxygen in the coflow suppresses the path to produce final combustion products and heat—thus reducing the reactivity of the whole system. © 2019","Computational singular perturbation; Jet-in-hot-coflow burner; Large Eddy Simulation; MILD combustion; Tangential stretching rate","Computation theory; Large eddy simulation; Mixing; Oxygen; Chemical activities; Combustion products; Computational singular perturbation; Experimental analysis; Heat Release Rate (HRR); Jet in hot coflow; MILD combustion; Stretching rates; Ignition; fuel; oxygen; Article; calculation; controlled study; dilution; exhaust gas; flame; flow; heat; priority journal; quantitative study; reduction (chemistry); simulation; stretching; tangential stretching rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068831874

Haze is a serious environmental problem that is influencing human health. This study focuses on revealing the spatial and temporal distribution characteristics of haze, haze formation factors, and health risks in China since the reform and opening-up. The purpose of this study is to provide a reference for haze governance and develop suggestions for public health. In this study, haze was identified by visibility and meteorological data from 1973 to 2017. Haze days and visibility on haze days were calculated during this period. By using standard deviation ellipse analysis and principal component regression, we calculated the variation of the haze barycenter, standard deviation in the haze area, and contribution rates of the main influencing factors in nine typical regions. Haze seasonal variation and health risk assessment were also analysed in this study. The results show that the changes in haze in China present as five periods: 1973–1979, 1980–1989, 1990–2001, 2002–2010, and 2011–2017. Haze days in the majority of typical cities in central and eastern China show a tendency of growth or fluctuating growth, and the variation intensified after the 1990s. In most areas, there were about 100 haze days, and the visibility on haze days was approximately 7 km until 2017. The main body of the haze area in China is approximately a diamond-shaped pentagon with BEIJING, CHENGDU, NANNING, GUANGZHOU, and SHANGHAI as the apexes. In addition, GANSU and northeast China are also influenced by haze. The haze situation in typical areas has grown since 1973. The haze centres tended to move outwards, especially from 2002-2010, which was a turning point for haze variation. For most regions, pollutant emissions as well as economic and governance factors were the main contributing factors. Haze has obvious seasonal variation in China. Haze in winter is the heaviest, and then haze in autumn, summer and spring becomes relatively mild. The haze health risk increased sharply and expanded from 1973 to 2017. High- and extremely high-risk areas are still concentrated in the diamond region of the haze area and have expanded along or surround main traffic lines and major cities. Through analysis of the contributions of haze factors in various regions of China, this study suggests that the most important means of haze governance comprise four aspects: I) a reduction of exhaust emissions, II) the implementation of green consumption, travel, and behaviour concepts, III) enhanced governance, and IV) urbanization that is as balanced as possible; furthermore, the development of cities such as enclaves should be promoted to avoid health risks to large cities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","China; Haze; Health risk; Natural factors; Social factors; Visibility","Factor analysis; Health; Meteorology; Pollution; Risk assessment; Statistics; Visibility; Air pollution in chinas; China; Environmental problems; Haze; Natural factors; Principal component regression; Social factor; Spatial and temporal distribution; Health risks; abiotic factor; atmospheric pollution; environmental factor; factor analysis; governance approach; haze; health risk; public health; risk assessment; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; traffic emission; visibility; air pollution; air quality; Article; autumn; China; comparative study; controlled study; economic development; geographic distribution; haze; health hazard; human; humidity; long term exposure; meteorology; priority journal; public health; seasonal variation; secondary organic aerosol; socioeconomics; spatiotemporal analysis; spring; summer; waste gas management; water vapor; wind speed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073653381

Warming is expected to initially increase Rh but studies show this increase may not be continuous or sustained. Specifically, LC and soil microbiome have been shown to contribute to the effect of extended warming on Rh. However, their relative contribution is unclear and this gap in knowledge causes considerable uncertainty in the prediction of carbon cycle feedbacks to climate change. In this study, we used a two-step incubation approach to reveal the relative contribution of LC limitation and soil microbial community responses in attenuating the effect that extended warming has on Rh. Soil samples from three Tibetan ecosystems—an alpine meadow (AM), alpine steppe (AS), and desert steppe (DS)—were exposed to a temperature gradient of 5–25°C. After an initial incubation period, soils were processed in one of two methods: (a) soils were sterilized then inoculated with parent soil microbes to assess the LC limitation effects, while controlling for microbial community responses; or (b) soil microbes from the incubations were used to inoculate sterilized parent soils to assess the microbial community effects, while controlling for LC limitation. We found both LC limitation and microbial community responses led to significant declines in Rh by 37% and 30%, respectively, but their relative contributions were ecosystem specific. LC limitation alone caused a greater Rh decrease for DS soils than AMs or ASs. Our study demonstrates that soil carbon loss due to Rh in Tibetan alpine soils—especially in copiotrophic soils—will be weakened by microbial community responses under short-term warming. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","labile carbon limitation; microbial community response; soil heterotrophic respiration; soil incubation; soil respiration acclimation","acclimation; community response; grassland; microbial community; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil respiration; warming; China; Xizang; carbon; microbiology; microflora; soil; Tibet; Carbon; Microbiota; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Tibet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071998582

While coal still plays a vital role in China's energy structure, new policy directions propose a 15% reduction in coal consumption by 2040 compared with 2016 as coal exploitation and use has caused extreme environmental pollution and land surface damage. Previous coal energy efficiency research has mainly been static analyses focused on coal-fired power plant efficiencies, carbon dioxide efficiencies, regional coal consumption and coal energy efficiencies, or coal mine area or enterprise production efficiencies, with few studies having included land destruction or other environmental problems. However, if a time factor is not included, it is generally impossible to accurately estimate the real changes in coal production efficiencies and land destruction. To overcome these deficiencies, this paper applied a modified dynamic DEA SBM model to evaluate the coal production efficiencies and land damage in 24 Chinese provinces from 2011 to 2016, from which it was found: (1) seven provinces were efficient in all six years and needed no further improvement; (2) the coal industry labor force, fixed assets, and coal production efficiencies dropped significantly, but the land damage was ambiguous; (3) the land loss efficiency analyses found that Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Guizhou, and Shaanxi had no need for further improvements; however, the land loss efficiency differences were large and there were improvements needed in 17 provinces, with the need for improvements expanding in 15 of these provinces; (4) even though Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and Shanxi had the largest coal mining operations, the need for land damage improvements was 0; however, Beijing and Guangxi had the smallest mining quantities, but the greatest need for land damage improvements.. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Coal mining; Dynamic DEA; Efficiency; Land destruction","Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal mines; Efficiency; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuel power plants; Carbon dioxide efficiencies; Coal mining; Coal mining industry; Coal-fired power plant; Coalmining operations; Enterprise production; Environmental pollutions; Environmental problems; Coal industry; carbon dioxide; coal mining; coal production; coal-fired power plant; energy efficiency; Beijing [China]; China; Guangxi Zhuangzu; Nei Monggol; Shaanxi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068518601

We also studied the C and N dynamics and the microbial community structure of the soil. In soil without litter, the application of biochar at a rate of 3% significantly decreased CO2 emissions, while addition of 1% biochar had no effect. Biochar application did not affect the net N mineralization rate but significantly reduced the NH4 + concentration after 90 days. In litter-enriched soil, biochar application had no significant effect on total CO2 emissions; however, application of 3% biochar significantly reduced the net N mineralization rate. Biochar application to soil with or without litter immediately reduced the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration independent of the application rate, which was primarily due to sorption of DOC by the biochar. Phospholipid fatty acid analysis demonstrated that both concentrations of added biochar to soil (with or without litter) altered the soil microbial community structure at the end of incubation, although the effect of biochar was not as strong as the effect of time or litter application. The effect of biochar addition alone on microbial community structure was inconsistent over time. Litter added to soil significantly increased fungi and reduced Gram-positive bacteria. In the presence of litter, biochar applied at both 1% and 3% significantly increased (p &lt; 0.05) the proportion of actinomycete only at day 90. Our results indicate biochar as a potentially effective measure for C sequestration in the test soil of a China fir plantation, even in the presence of litter. © 2018, Northeast Forestry University and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Biochar; China fir; CO2 production; Litter; Microbial community structure; Mineralization","biochar; biomineralization; carbon dioxide; community structure; coniferous tree; leaf litter; microbial activity; microbial community; plantation; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil nitrogen; Cunninghamia; Fungi; Posibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85048989830

The parameters d50 and σg for PM2.5 size separators are regulated in the official measurement methods of many countries and regions. However, those parameters for PM1 size separators have not been previously specified. The interaction of particle size distributions (PSDs) and the particle size separator performance characteristics has significant influence on the PM sampling results. Atmospheric PSDs for each of the four seasons covering a range of particulate pollution concentrations were measured in urban Beijing. The relative differences (RD) between estimated PM2.5/PM1 sampler concentrations and actual concentrations associated with the interaction between performance characteristics of size separator and actually measured urban PSDs, as well as for three idealized ambient PSDs, have been systematically investigated. For the PM2.5 size separator, when tolerance of cutpoint is 2.5 ± 0.2 µm and σg is no greater than 1.3, RD values for most typical urban atmospheric aerosol conditions were within the permissible error range (± 5%).

To improve the understanding of factors determining the PM2.5 level in China, a source apportionment tool coupled with the RAMS-CMAQ model (CMAQ-ISAM) was used to quantify the contribution of transport to PM2.5 and its major components during 2017 in the North China Plain (NCP), Yangtze River Delta (YRD), Pearl River Delta (PRD), and Chengyu area. It is found that transport accounts for a predominant fraction of the PM2.5 in Beijing, Tianjin, and Shanghai with relatively low PM2.5 levels. Transport in the NCP is mainly at intraregional scale and comparable to local emissions. In contrast, the contributions of interregional transport from the NCP to the YRD (~10–25%) and from NCP and YRD to PRD and Chengyu (~5–25%) is at similar level to those of intraregional transport and local emissions in winter and fall, but are lower in spring and summer. It is worth noting that particle components have very different transport capabilities. Nitrate exhibits much stronger intraregional transport than other components in the NCP, and much higher concentration than other components during winter. In contrast, the concentration of sulfate is higher than that of nitrate during spring and summer in most provinces. In addition, the transport potential of primary OC, EC, and ammonia are relatively weaker, but these compounds can still have considerable contributions. Our results reveal that the notable contributions of regional transport to PM2.5 should be addressed according to targeted emission sources in order to improve air quality efficiently. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; China; CMAQ-ISAM; PM2.5; Regional transport","Air quality; Ammonia; Nitrates; River pollution; Sulfur compounds; Air pollution in chinas; China; CMAQ-ISAM; PM2.5; Regional air quality modeling; Regional transport; Source apportionment; Transport capabilities; Atmospheric movements; ammonia; nitrate; organic carbon; sulfate; air quality; atmospheric pollution; particulate matter; pollutant transport; source apportionment; air quality; Article; autumn; China; concentration (parameter); particulate matter; priority journal; spring; summer; traffic and transport; winter; Beijing [China]; China; Guangdong; North China Plain; Shanghai; Tianjin; Zhujiang Delta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069725527

The deposition rates, compositions and sources, however, were poorly constrained. Especially, the variabilities of atmospheric deposition in the Atacama Desert corresponding to a changing climate were unassessed. In this work, the atmospheric depositions collected using dust traps across a west-east elevation gradient in the Atacama (~23°S) from 1/2/2010 to 12/31/2011 were analyzed and compared to previous results in 2007–2009. The insoluble dust deposition rates in our sampling period were significantly higher than those of 2007–2009 in most dust traps, which was attributed to the changes in wind, highlighting the importance of long-term monitoring of insoluble dust fluxes. Soluble salts, instead, showed less distinct interannual variations in deposition rates, geochemical compositions or source contributions. At the coastal site (T1), soluble salts were originated from both primary sea-salt (SS) aerosols and non-sea-salt (NSS) sources such as anthropogenic emission, marine biogenic emission and biomass burning; the deposition rates of these salts largely depended on the wind speed and the amount of anthropogenic emissions. Sulfur isotopic evidence further showed that NSS sulfate at T1 was mainly originated from local SO2 emission from local power plants. The inland sites (T2-T8) displayed much lower soluble salts deposition rates, and the salts were primarily sourced from entrainment of local surface minerals, including Na(Cl, NO3), CaSO4, and nitrate formed via atmospheric oxidation of anthropogenic NOx. Sulfur isotopic compositions of sulfate deposited at T2-T8 were similar to those in local surface soil; however, three sites near the Chuquicamata mine showed slightly lower δ34Ssulfate values, indicating the presence of secondary sulfate originated from mining activities. The soluble salts deposited at the Andean site (T10) were dominantly from wet deposition that incorporated local lake salts, and therefore, the deposition rates were mainly controlled by the amount of precipitation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Atacama Desert; Atmospheric deposition; Interannual comparison; Sulfur isotopes","Atmospheric chemistry; Deposition rates; Dust; Importance sampling; Isotopes; Landforms; Meteorological problems; Sulfur compounds; Wind; Anthropogenic emissions; Atacama Desert; Atacama desert , Chile; Atmospheric depositions; Atmospheric oxidation; Geochemical composition; Interannual; Sulfur isotope; Salts; aerosol; annual variation; atmospheric deposition; chemical composition; comparative study; dust; sea salt; spatial distribution; sulfur isotope; Atacama Desert; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070578261

The obviously enhanced output of COX by-products (CO &amp; CO2) was observed over these modified catalysts, although they showed the significantly improved selectivity of aromatics. It was found COX formation is actually determined by the chemical state of surface Zn species. Concretely, both surface ZnO and surface metal-zinc are the reactive sites for the conversion of methanol to COX and H2. At the initial period of reaction, surface ZnO (no reduction) causes COX (mainly CO2) formation may almost-exclusively through methanol steam-reforming. With the extending of reaction-time, while it′s partially reduced to metal-zinc which more violently catalyzes the conversion of methanol to COX (both CO and CO2) may through the pathway of first dehydrogenation-decomposition and subsequent Water-Gas-Shift reaction. However, the surface ZnOH+ species as Lewis acid hardly results in COX formation, but significantly promotes aromatization due to its interaction-dehydrogenation effect. As high as possible ratio of the ZnOH+ in surface Zn species is conducive to both suppressing the side-reaction which produces COX and incubating the high aromatic selectivity even in the time-on-stream reaction.

In this paper, a comprehensive environmental performance investigation has been conducted to reveal the potential for emission reductions. A new environmental impact methodology has been built, and various influencing factors are evaluated. In respect of the climates, the hourly energy consumption emission first increases and then declines, which is the result of multiple effects from the weighting factors of fuel source emissions and each heating sector’s performance. Under the operation condition map for the current study, the effects of the target (final) water temperatures, electricity generation emission factor reduction, and price ratios are revealed to be the top 3 heaviest fluctuations for emissions for hourly system operation energy consumption, followed by each heating sector’s efficiency enhancements. The environmental impacts due to hourly system operation do not closely follow the hourly energy consumption profile for the effect of climate conditions and can be quite opposite when considering the effect of fuel source price ratios. In addition, the lifetime environmental performance has been examined for typical cities in China. In the cold region, such as Shenyang, the emission due to the natural gas contributor shares more than 46% of the total emissions. For warm cities (Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chengdu), the emission of the natural gas is only responsible for ~ 9% or even less of the total emissions. A switch from R410A (GWP100:1924) to R452B (GWP100:675) can also lead to ~ 11% emission total reductions for city of Shanghai, Wuhan, and Chengdu. It is anticipated that the viewpoints and insights from this study can be beneficial for the engineers, policymakers, scholars, public, and manufactures to maintaining the maximum sustainability and economic benefits. © 2018, Islamic Azad University (IAU).","Environmental impact; Gas heater; Heat pump; Hybrid system; Price ratio; Space heating","Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Environmental management; Fuel systems; Gas emissions; Gas heating; Heat pump systems; Hybrid systems; Natural gas; Pumps; Space heating; Sustainable development; Efficiency enhancement; Electricity generation; Environmental performance; Gas heaters; Heat pumps; Heating applications; Operation conditions; Price ratio; Economic and social effects; climate conditions; electricity generation; emission control; environmental impact; environmental impact assessment; equipment; heating; methodology; natural gas; pump; urban area; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055937789

However, it is difficult to resolve the dispute because its resolution varies across different provinces. In this study, the emission reduction effects of EV adoption are assessed by province to provide suggestions to provincial governments. A well-to-wheel model is employed to reveal the current situation of SO2 and NOX emissions reduction by using passenger EVs instead of internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs), and the marginal effects of adopting EVs are compared to demonstrate regional heterogeneity. The results showed that in 2017, the adoption of EVs in all regions can reduce NOX emission, but only in the region south of the Yangtze River can it reduce SO2 emission. SO2 emissions are even promoted by adopting EVs in some northern provinces, such as Shandong, Shanxi and Hebei. The marginal environmental effects revealed that the future potential for emission reduction is mainly from southern provinces, including Sichuan, Guangdong, Hubei and Yunnan, due to their large market potential and availability of clean power. Finally, provinces are classified into five types, and individual suggestions are proposed to improve emission reduction in different provinces. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollutants emissions; Electric vehicles; Power structure; Regional differences; Well-to-wheel","Air pollution; Coal combustion; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Vehicle wheels; Air pollutants; Current situation; Emission reduction; Environmental benefits; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Power structures; Regional differences; Well-to-wheel; Electric power system interconnection; nitric oxide; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; electric vehicle; emission control; nitrogen oxides; sulfur dioxide; technology adoption; Article; carbon footprint; chemical analysis; China; combustion; comparative study; energy; environmental impact; environmental policy; methodology; motor vehicle; reduction (chemistry); river; China; Guangdong; Hubei; Shandong; Yangtze River; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069574348

As a climate-sensitive region, the Qinghai Lake Basin (QLB) has experienced extensive land-use transitions. A three-year manipulative experiment was conducted in two grassland types around the QLB, including a natural alpine grassland (NG) and its adjacent restored grassland (RG), to examine the responses of soil nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) content to nutrient application with land-use. N addition continuously increased soil NO3 −-N (SAN) content of NG in the whole experiment period, while displaying no detectable effect on SAN content of RG in the first experiment year. Nutrient addition presented no direct effects on soil total N (STN) content. However, N addition potentially promoted STN content indirectly by increasing SAN content, both in NG and RG. P addition significantly increased soil available P (SAP) content during the whole study period for both grasslands. Nevertheless, P addition significantly increased soil total P (STP) content of NG in the last two experiment years, while only elevating STP content of RG in the last experiment year. The results revealed that soil N and P content presented convergent and divergent responses to nutrient addition between NG and RG. STN and STP content were both positively related to growing season precipitation (GSP). SAN content was positively associated with growing season temperature in NG, and RG in N addition treatment.

Although the sponge city concept has been applied in both macro-scales and micro-scales to address those challenges, research on the heterogeneity of different cities for sponge city construction and the collaborative management between cities is insufficient. Therefore, this paper proposes a multivariate cluster analysis framework and conducts an empirical study using 96 Chinese cities. By considering the local infrastructure, economic development, water resource distribution, water quality and precipitation characteristics in each city, and integrating the principal component analysis and a self-organizing feature mapping network, this paper shows the potential of regional and interregional sponge city collaborative management. This will provide an opportunity for developing a new sponge city management mechanism and will promote the establishment of multi-functional departments for urban flood control and water quality improvement. © 2019 by the authors.","Heterogeneity; Principal component analysis; Self-organizing feature mapping; Sponge city","Cluster analysis; Flood control; Floods; Mapping; Multivariant analysis; Principal component analysis; Self organizing maps; Water pollution; Water quality; Water resources; Collaborative management; Heterogeneity; Multivariate cluster analysis; Precipitation characteristics; Resource distribution; Self-organizing feature mapping; Sponge city; Water quality improvements; Quality control; climate change; flood control; flooding; heterogeneity; management practice; multivariate analysis; precipitation (climatology); principal component analysis; urban planning; urbanization; water pollution; water quality; water resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073192925

Green infrastructure, however, may itself be vulnerable to a changing climate, and not all garden and landscape plant taxa will remain viable under weather scenarios predicted for the future. It has been suggested that cultivated forms of garden plants (hybrids and selected varieties) particularly, will be susceptible to enhanced stress associated with more frequent flooding, drought and rapid oscillations between these hydrological extremes; thus potentially limiting the range of taxa that can be used in gardens in the future. This research explored this concept by evaluating cultivated forms of the common garden plant – Primula, and testing whether these were less resilient to the effects of hydrological extremes than their progenitor species, Primula vulgaris. The results support this hypothesis and demonstrated that cultivated taxa were more susceptible to the hydrological stresses imposed than Primula vulgaris. Interestingly though, those cultivars that superficially resembled the parent species (Primula ‘Cottage Cream’) showed more stress tolerance than others with larger or more ornamental flowers, suggesting a ‘gradient of susceptibility’ within the hybrids. The notion that the most flamboyant cultivars are sacrificing stress tolerance for traits linked with aesthetics is discussed. The data, albeit on one genus only, has implications for the design of gardens/ornamental landscapes for the future and calls for more attention within breeding programmes to enhance abiotic stress tolerance within garden and landscape plants. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate change; Drought; Green infrastructure; Landscape; Ornamental; Waterlogging",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072173922

In France, public subsidies allocated to the development of such systems should reach 350 million euros by 2020, representing a 36% increase compared with 2018. Yet surprisingly little has been done to assess the district heating potential in this country. The purpose of this paper is therefore to provide this assessment. The demand for space heating and domestic hot water in residential and commercial buildings is first determined using data with a resolution of 200 m × 200 m. The linear heat density of the potential district heating networks is then calculated for each of the 5,356,608 grid cells. The 43,565 agglomerations where district heating could reach a linear heat density exceeding 1.5 MWhth/m.a represent 62% of the total heat demand. Even in a scenario where the heat demand uniformly decreases by 50% due to the penetration of energy-efficient buildings, the district heating potential remains 5 times greater than current district heating deliveries. However, the identified potential cannot be fully unlocked due to the widespread use of individual heating systems.

Using a policy mixes approach to address this challenge, we characterize adaptation policy based on a general model of how governments govern issues of societal interest. We argue that this approach allows for context-sensitive measurement of adaptation policy, while being both comparable and parsimonious. This approach is tested in a study of adaptation policies adopted by 125 local governments located in Canada, France, Germany, the Netherlands, and the UK. Using a systematic data collection protocol, a total of 3328 adaptation policies were identified from local council archives between the periods of January 2010 and May 2017. Results of this analysis suggest that there is structured variation emerging in how local governments govern climate change adaptation, which justifies calls for comparative adaptation research to use measurements that capture the totality of adaptation policies being adopted by governments rather than focusing on specific types of adaptation policy. We conclude with a discussion of key issues for further developing of this approach. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",,"Climate change; Adaptation policies; Climate change adaptation; Comparative research; Context sensitive; Data collection protocols; General model; Local government; Netherlands; Public policy; adaptive management; climate change; conceptual framework; environmental policy; spatiotemporal analysis; Canada; France; Germany; Netherlands; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073935192

However, in response to global change, a shift from Sphagnumdominated to vascular-plant-dominated peatlands may occur, with a potential alteration in their C-sink function. To investigate how the main GHG fluxes (CO2 and CH4) are affected by a plant community change (shift from dominance of Sphagnum mosses to vascular plants, i.e., Molinia caerulea), a mesocosm experiment was set up. Gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (ER) and CH4 emission models were used to estimate the annual C balance and global warming potential under both vegetation covers. While the ER and CH4 emission models estimated an output of, respectively, 376±108 and 7±4 gCm-2 yr-1 in Sphagnum mesocosms, this reached 1018±362 and 33± 8 gCm-2 yr-1 in mesocosms with Sphagnum rubellum and Molinia caerulea. Annual modeled GPP was estimated at ..414±122 and ..1273±482 gCm-2 yr-1 in Sphagnum and Sphagnum + Molinia plots, respectively, leading to an annual CO2 and CH4 budget of -30 gCm-2 yr-1 in Sphagnum plots and of -223 gCm-2 yr-1 in Sphagnum + Molinia ones (i.e., a C sink). Even if CH4 emissions accounted for a small part of the gaseous C efflux (ca. 3 %), their global warming potential value makes both plant communities have a climate warming effect.

In view of it, many communities worldwide are collecting air quality data privately to influence their policy makers to make stricter provisions for reducing harmful emissions and thereby improving their quality of life. Likewise, in many German cities, a community of air quality monitors which rely on low-cost PM Sensors is gathering momentum. Such communities possess privately-owned & low-cost air quality monitoring devices that claim to accurately measure PM concentrations and are openly accessible via internet. One such initiative is an air quality monitoring network viz. ""luftdaten.info"", which contains of more than 300 low-cost sensors that consistently obtains PM data, colloquially referred as fine dust, in the city of Stuttgart as well as its surrounding districts. Besides, eight stations are continuously monitoring PM concentration in Stuttgart; these are operated by the State Environmental Agency (LuBW-Landesanstalt für Umwelt Baden-Württemberg). Stuttgart University of Applied Sciences (HFT) has currently installed 7 low-cost PM sensors to monitor and study PM concentration in one of its projects. This study endeavors to relate PM 2.5 and PM 10.0 using low-cost sensors. It intends to investigate the reliability of the measured PM concentration using such low-costs sensors once these are placed horizontally and vertically apart and comparing the measures of the 7 sensors. Another objective is to compare the PM concentration measurements with a meteorological station operated by the State of Baden-Wuerttemberg in the vicinity. A correlation analysis is performed to develop understanding of relationships of PM concentration with meteorological parameters, viz. with respect to ambient temperature, air pressure, humidity, wind speed and wind direction. Furthermore, it attempts to develop a regression model using above listed meteorological parameters. Finally, deficiencies in the measurement of low-costs and its placement effects are commented. Further suggestions are made for improving the data capturing and analytical procedures while using low-cost sensors. © 2019 K.

Most related studies take a national or regional perspective on the impact of climate change. Taiwan is constrained by its geographical conditions, which increase its vulnerability to climate change, especially in its western coastal areas. The county that is most affected by climate change is Yunlin. In 2013–2014, projects that were sponsored by Taiwan’s government analyzed the relationship among synthesized vulnerability, ecological footprint (EF) and adaptation to climate change and proposed 15 categories of synthesized vulnerability and EF values. This study further examines the relationship between vulnerability and EF values and examines how residents of four townships—Linnei, Sihu, Mailiao, and Huwei—cope with the effects of climate change. This study investigates whether the residents of the four townships vary in their attitudes to climate change, their perceptions of disaster risk, and their behavioral intentions with respect to coping with climate change. The structural equation model (SEM) is used to examine the relationships among attitudes to climate change, perceptions of disaster risk, and the behavioral intentions of residents in townships with various vulnerabilities to climate change. The results that are obtained using the SEM reveal that climate change mitigation/adaptation behavior is affected by attitudes to climate change and perceptions of disaster risk. However, the effects of attitudes and perceptions on mitigation and adaptation that are mediated by place attachment are not statistically significant. © 2018, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Ecological footprint; Place attachment; Risk perception; Structural equation model; Vulnerability","adaptive management; climate change; coastal zone; disaster management; ecological footprint; governance approach; mitigation; perception; public attitude; vulnerability; Mailiao; Taiwan; Yunlin; attitude; climate change; comparative study; coping behavior; disaster; environmental protection; female; human; male; physiology; rural population; Taiwan; theoretical model; young adult; Adaptation, Psychological; Attitude; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Disasters; Female; Humans; Male; Models, Theoretical; Rural Population; Taiwan; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85041503376

The concept of using the volcano curve to predict catalysts for an entire homologous series of reactions has been unexplored. Herein the catalytic activity of seven monometallic catalysts (Pt, Pd, Rh, Ag, Ni, Cu, and Co/Al2O3) and three Ag-Pd/Al2O3 bimetallic catalysts is evaluated in the total oxidation of small alkanes (methane, ethane, propane, and isobutane) in the 280–400 °C temperature range under fuel lean and rich conditions. We show that hysteresis in activity, with three distinct kinetic regimes, is a common phenomenon of alkane oxidation over all catalysts studied when varying the oxygen concentration, and the size of the hysteresis loop depends on the oxophilicity of the catalyst and the reducing ability of the hydrocarbon. Expectedly, the concept of the universality of the volcano curve for a homologous series is valid but only when a suitable surrogate substrate is chosen. Hydrocarbons with two or more carbon atoms can serve as surrogates of the alkane homologous series, whereas methane is not. Interestingly and consistent with the hysteresis, the feed composition controls the catalyst oxidation state and potentially impacts the optimal catalyst descriptors used to determine new catalysts. The predicted 1:3 Ag-Pd catalyst is indeed superior to single metals for the homologous series under fuel lean conditions for ethane and larger alkanes. It is inferior to Pt under fuel rich conditions and better than Pd and Pt for methane rich conditions. A method for qualitative inference of the catalyst structure, based on the volcano curve and the oxidation state of the catalyst, is proposed. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ag-Pd; Alkanes; Bimetallics; Catalytic combustion; Homologous series; Palladium; Platinum","Binary alloys; Catalysis; Catalytic oxidation; Ethane; Fuels; Hysteresis; Methane; Oxidation; Palladium; Palladium alloys; Paraffins; Platinum; Silver alloys; Volcanoes; Bimetallics; Catalyst oxidation state; Catalytic combustion; Fuel-lean conditions; Fuel-rich conditions; Homologous series; Monometallic catalysts; Oxygen concentrations; Catalyst activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072267943

Their different magnetocrystalline anisotropies induce different types of metamagnetic transitions: spin-flop versus spin-flip.

Co2(As2O7)·2H2O (1) orders antiferromagnetically below TN = 6.7 K. The magnetic structure is a noncollinear antiferromagnetic spin arrangement along the zigzag chains with DFT calculations implying frustrated chains and weakened anisotropy. A metamagnetic transition suggests a spin-flop process above μ0H = 3.2 T. In contrast, in BaCo2As2O8·2H2O (2) linear chains are arranged in disconnected layers, with only interchain ferromagnetic exchanges, therefore increasing its magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The magnetic structure is collinear with a magnetic easy axis that allows a spin-flop to a sharp spin-flip transition below TN = 15.1 K and above μ0H = 6.2 T.

However, estimating their separate and combined effects remains a research challenge. In South Africa, streamflow dynamics are important not only for irrigated agriculture but also for many rural communities that depend on streamflow for domestic water supply. In this paper, we analysed the effects of pine, wattle and eucalyptus plantation cover change vis-à-vis the effects of inter-annual climate variability on streamflow dynamics of the Upper Umvoti River in South Africa from 1994 to 2016. We modelled inter-annual variability in streamflow by precipitation, temperature and plantation cover using the Bayesian inference. We mapped plantation cover from Landsat satellite imagery. We found strong evidence for an interaction between temperature range and plantation cover net change on streamflow. Specifically, the plantation effect weakened under conditions of high-temperature range anomalies. We explain this interaction with a shift in soil water repellency and interception capacity within the plantation area under a changing temperature range, with important implications for the formation of surface runoff. Previous studies have assumed that the effects of climate variability and plantation cover change on streamflow dynamics are independent. Our results call this assumption into question. Hence, climate and land cover interdependencies should be accounted for in future statistical and process-based modelling studies. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Afforestation; Climate variability; Interaction; Soil water repellency; South Africa; Streamflow dynamics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068740463

Carbon dioxide is one of the main causes of such temperature increase, thus avoiding its release in the atmosphere through capture and/or utilization strategies is a valuable tool to limit greenhouse effect. Presently, the applied technology for sequestrating CO2 relies on its reaction with amines in aqueous solutions, giving rise to the formation of carbamates and carbonates. However, due to the energy intensive release step, toxicity and corrosiveness, amine scrubbing could not represent a long-term solution in CO2 capture. Ionic liquids (ILs), organic salts in the liquid state near room temperature, are a class of emerging materials with a great potential towards CO2 capture. Recently the combination of the choline cation with amino acids based anions gave rise to a wide set of bio-inspired ILs with low toxicity, that, due to the presence of amino groups in the amino acid moiety, are optimal candidates for CO2 capture. In the present work, two choline-amino acids ILs were synthesized, containing glycine and proline, according to an innovative procedure, overcoming some drawbacks proper of the classical methods. A throughout IR operando study of the CO2 absorption process in these amino acids based ILs was performed. Even though elementary reactions are the same for all the investigated systems, different absorption pathways were recognized depending on the amino acid based anion.

Here we present high-resolution Chandra X-ray Observatory and Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array observations of five nearby BCDs with stellar masses of less than the Small Magellanic Cloud (M ∗ ∼ 107-108.4 M o). We search for signatures of accreting massive BHs at X-ray and radio wavelengths, which are more sensitive to lower BH accretion rates than optical searches. We detect a total of 10 hard X-ray sources and 10 compact radio sources at luminosities consistent with star-formation-related emission. We find one case of a spatially coincident X-ray and radio source within the astrometric uncertainties. If the X-ray and radio emission are indeed coming from the same source, the origin of the radiation is plausibly from an active massive BH with log (M BH/M o) ∼ 4.8 ± 1.1. However, given that the X-ray and radio emission are also coincident with a young star cluster complex, we consider the combination of an X-ray binary and a supernova remnant (or H ii region) a viable alternative explanation. Overall, we do not find compelling evidence for active massive BHs in our target BCDs, which on average have stellar masses more than an order of magnitude lower than previous samples of dwarf galaxies found to host massive BHs. Our results suggest that moderately accreting massive BHs in BCDs are not so common as to permit unambiguous detection in a small sample. © 2019. The American Astronomical Society.

Moreover, in urban area, the intensity of more and more frequent heatwaves is magnified by Urban Heat Island (UHI) effects and it increases the production of CO2 due to the intensification in cooling demand. Over the years, the historic settlement (medieval town) has showed to be more resilient to temperature changes than modern district. This paper compares the historic district with the modern one in Bari (southern Italy) in terms of morphology, type and construction technology through Envi-met simulations. It highlights how the fabric of the old town may have positive impact on summer regime for thermal comfort and its analysis can be useful for the definition of some guidelines for contemporary settlement. Natural solutions (e.g. vegetation, green roofs and water jects) and cool materials are proposed to reduce energy demand according to EU directive 2018/844 and complying with the constraints for consolidated urban area. The aim is also to evaluate the solutions for microclimate mitigation of urban canyons towards zero energy settlement starting from the old town features. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

However, scientists have a limited understanding of how local currents affect the chemical and thermal relationships between the reef building corals and the surrounding saltwater environment. Coral reefs are known to cause a diel-cycle with dramatic changes in the carbonate system along with oxygen. As calcifying reefs grow, they remove calcium and carbonate ions, reducing dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and total alkalinity (TAlk) and decreasing pH levels. The carbonate ions must be replaced in order for the coral to continue its calcification at a consistent rate. This residence time of surrounding seawater is very difficult to locally quantify in a coral reef as the bathymetry is complex, creating variable currents in all 3 dimensions. Ocean acidification and its negative impact on coral reef health is expected to increase, and fine-scale observations of the link between residence time of surrounding seawater and the dynamic change in water properties remain unknown. A prototype sensor was built with the aim to provide direct measurements of the fine-scale mixing dynamic to collect data from which estimates of mass transfer can be calculated within the reef environment. The neutrally buoyant passive sensor tracks local water parcels in 3 dimensions and records water parameters in a small area on a coral reef. The design and prototyping of this type of sensor will lead to an improved observational tool in coral reef research. © 2019 Marine Technology Society.","Coral reefs; Lagrangian drifters; Mass transfer; Ocean acidification; Turbulence","Acidification; Alkalinity; Biomineralization; Carbonation; Mass transfer; Oceanography; Seawater; Surface waters; Turbulence; Coral reef; Direct measurement; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Lagrangian drifters; Ocean acidifications; Sea surface temperature (SST); Total alkalinities; Water parameters; Reefs",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079059806

Kraft pulp mills produce CO2 mainly in combustion processes. The largest sources are the recovery boiler, the biomass boiler, and the lime kiln. Due to utilizing mostly biomass-based fuels, the CO2 is largely biogenic. Capture and storage of CO2 (CCS) could offer pulp and paper industry the possibility to act as site for negative CO2 emissions. In addition, captured biogenic CO2 can be used as a raw material for bioproducts. Possibilities for CO2 utilization include tall oil manufacturing, lignin extraction, and production of precipitated calcium carbonate (PCC), depending on local conditions and mill-specific details. In this study, total biomass-based CO2 capture and storage potential (BECCS) and potential to implement capture and utilization of biomass-based CO2 (BECCU) in kraft pulp mills were estimated by analyzing the impacts of the processes on the operation of two modern reference mills, a Nordic softwood kraft pulp mill with integrated paper production and a Southern eucalyptus kraft pulp mill. CO2 capture is energy-intensive, and thus the effects on the energy balances of the mills were estimated. When papermaking is integrated in the mill operations, energy adequacy can be a limiting factor for carbon capture implementation. Global carbon capture potential was estimated based on pulp production data. Kraft pulp mills have notable CO2 capture potential, while the on-site utilization potential using currently available technologies is lower. The future of these processes depends on technology development, desire to reuse CO2, and prospective changes in legislation. © 2019, The Author(s).","Bioenergy with carbon capture and storage BECCS; Bioenergy with carbon capture and utilization BECCU; Climate change mitigation; Kraft pulp mill; Negative CO2","biomass; calcium carbonate; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; combustion; energy balance; lignin; limiting factor; pulp and paper industry; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85059667248

Biochar, one by-product of pyrolysis, can be utilized in multiple ways by different biochar applications, which could result in considerable changes in renewable energy production and carbon sequestration. In existing literature, however, the economic and environmental benefits of pyrolysis and biochar applications are rately discussed, thus, a thorough investigation on conjunctive applications of pyrolysis and biochar should be conducted. This study (1) reviews the pyrolysis outputs from various inputs such as energy crops, crop residuals, animal manures, municipal solid wastes, and sewer sludge; (2) discusses the economic and environmental consequences from pyrolysis and biochar applications through the investigation of a lifecycle assessment; and (3) illustrates the potential climate-induced impacts on agriculture and stability of feedstock supply. To do this, this paper adopts a sector-wide model to compare the effectiveness and efficiency of pyrolysis and biochar applications with and without impacts of climate change for a specific region as a case study; and addresses the influential factors that potentially affect the large-scale development of pyrolysis. The results show that, in the absence of climate change impacts, conjunctive applications of pyrolysis and biochar can reduce more than 2.69 million tons of CO2 emission and generate electricity of 3,962 MWh annually. In the cases where climate-induced impacts do have influences on crop yields, transitions among pyrolysis technologies and agricultural practice would occur. Under such a circumstance, net electricity generation and emission reduction would decrease by 1.72% and 3.19%, respectively. Thus,taking potential climate change impacts into account is necessary to avoid considerable deviations from the target. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Climate change; Lifecycle analysis; Sectoral model; Uncertainty","Climate models; Crops; Economic and social effects; Electric power generation; Emission control; Fertilizers; Forestry; Life cycle; Municipal solid waste; Pyrolysis; Renewable energy resources; Uncertainty analysis; Bio-energy; Economic and environmental benefits; Effectiveness and efficiencies; Environmental consequences; Large-scale development; Life cycle analysis; Renewable energy development; Uncertainty; Climate change",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070877790

State bodies of different spatial scales continuously put efforts to foster tourism growth and tourism is viewed as a prosperous economic path for the future. The prevailing tourism development is resort-oriented, which has transformed rural geographies in the North. Critical tourism geography research highlights that such market-driven tourism development has negative social and environmental consequences. Thus, tourism change needs to be examined from a broader perspective than economic benefits alone. It is required that tourism economy serves people and not vice versa. To increase sustainability in destination localities, collective economic agency in destinations is encouraged in tourism research and development. To date, tourism research has tended to draw on multiple, often contradicting, theoretical perspectives in an attempt to clarify how collective agency in tourism destinations should be best organized in order to foster social justice and ecological sustainability. The aim of this thesis is to understand how sustainability can be facilitated through local economic relations in resort-oriented destination development contexts. Sustainability discussions in tourism research are advanced by drawing on economic geography and its critical takes. The thesis consists of three studies that each examine sustainability in tourism destinations from a different viewpoint. The thesis first examines how (un)sustainability currently manifests in local economic relations and then discusses what changes are required to move towards more sustainable tourism futures. Ethnographically oriented case studies and a contemporary variant of the grounded theory method enables approaching tourism economies from the perspective of everyday tourism realities. The empirical part of the research is conducted in the Ruka and Ylläs destinations in the Finnish North. Insights were gathered by semi-structured in-depth interviews with local tourism actors in 2012 and 2015. The study introduces a poststructural political economy approach to sustainability transformations in tourism destinations. The less growth-focused economic thinking that exists in destinations is brought to light. Tourism actors' motives and aims can differ drastically from the rationales of growth-focused tourism destination development that dominate in networked tourism governance. Many of the tourism actors desire conservation of natural and cultural environment in destinations. This creates conflict between the coexisting tourism paths. In the thesis, it is argued that economic difference in tourism should not be conceptualized merely as a source of diversification of tourism supply and thus as beneficial for destination growth; it should be recognized as political agency in tourism economy. Tourism networking is already now often value-driven, and this needs to be encouraged. That is, transformative agency for tourism change can be gained and new tourism paths created also through incremental changes 'from below', not only via policy actions. To contribute to the critical (economic) geography research on social and economic change, this thesis highlights that it is central to understand not only what new economic futures look like but also how to work towards them in everyday politics. Although the alternative and critical voices are valuable as they accurately state a socially just view of how things ought to be, these voices may not be the best way to bring about a change. This is because power hierarchies are not easily recognized in everyday tourism work. Each actor interprets the social from their subjective point of view. Even actors with the most power can have personal experiences of powerlessness. Thus, to foster change, it is necessary to facilitate the transformation of the existing conflictual inter-group relations. Dialogical everyday politics could work as a means to foster understanding of different groups' tourism realities and their mutual influence. Conflict could be regarded not solely as an innate feature of capitalist economic relations but also as moments where mutual understanding can be facilitated. This is a way to establish local economic relations that enable community building. Destination sustainability touches not only firm-level practices but the mode of economic organization in tourism destinations. The thesis highlights that to advance social justice and environmental sustainability in destinations, destination development and planning should account for the possibility for a less growth-focused destination development path. As alternative tourism paths do not, as a rule, depend on new, large-scale tourism construction, they would likewise not foster growth in international tourist numbers and air travel. This unconventional view on economic path creation is to be encouraged as it is better in line with climate change mitigation needs and critical sustainability theorizing. © 2019 Geographical Society of Northern Finland.

Main aim of direct recycling approach is to reduce greenhouse gasses emission compared with primary aluminium production and conventional recycling. Other advantages are higher scrap material yield during recycling and energy savings. In this paper, SSR process consisted of aluminium chips hot extrusion and afterwards severe plastic deformation process at room and elevated temperatures. Mechanical properties of the solid state recycled samples obtained by presented process were comparable with samples obtained by conventional manufacturing. Furthermore, it was shown that additional plastic deformation after hot extrusion significantly improved mechanical properties of the recycled samples compared with those recycled only by hot extrusion.

Biofilm formation and cell aggregation under a high shear force depend on temperature and salt concentrations. It is the last of five E. coli strains (C, K12, B, W, Crooks) designated as safe for laboratory purposes whose genome has not been sequenced. Results: Here we present the complete genomic sequence of this strain in which we utilized both long-read PacBio-based sequencing and high resolution optical mapping to confirm a large inversion in comparison to the other laboratory strains. Notably, DNA sequence comparison revealed the absence of several genes thought to be involved in biofilm formation, including antigen 43, waaSBOJYZUL for lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis, and cpsB for curli synthesis. The first main difference we identified that likely affects biofilm formation is the presence of an IS3-like insertion sequence in front of the carbon storage regulator csrA gene. This insertion is located 86 bp upstream of the csrA start codon inside the - 35 region of P4 promoter and blocks the transcription from the sigma32 and sigma70 promoters P1-P3 located further upstream. The second is the presence of an IS5/IS1182 in front of the csgD gene. And finally, E. coli C encodes an additional sigma70 subunit driven by the same IS3-like insertion sequence. Promoter analyses using GFP gene fusions provided insights into understanding this regulatory pathway in E. coli. Conclusions: Biofilms are crucial for bacterial survival, adaptation, and dissemination in natural, industrial, and medical environments. Most laboratory strains of E. coli grown for decades in vitro have evolved and lost their ability to form biofilm, while environmental isolates that can cause infections and diseases are not safe to work with. Here, we show that the historic laboratory strain of E. coli C produces a robust biofilm and can be used as a model organism for multicellular bacterial research. Furthermore, we ascertained the full genomic sequence of this classic strain, which provides for a base level of characterization and makes it useful for many biofilm-based applications. © 2019 The Author(s).","Aggregation; Bacterial stress response; Carbon storage regulator; Complete genome sequence; Curli synthesis; E. coli biofilm formation; Salt concentration; Sigma 70; Temperature stress","bacterial DNA; green fluorescent protein; lipopolysaccharide; Escherichia coli protein; transcription factor; adaptation; Article; bacterial gene; bacterial genome; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterial survival; biofilm; controlled study; csgD gene; csrA gene; DNA extraction; DNA sequence; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli C; gene fusion; gene rearrangement; gene sequence; genetic transcription; genome rearrangement; nonhuman; promoter region; sequence analysis; start codon; synthesis; bacterial genome; bacterium adherence; biofilm; chromosomal mapping; chromosome inversion; Escherichia coli; gene expression regulation; genetics; growth, development and aging; regulator gene; salt stress; temperature; Bacterial Adhesion; Biofilms; Chromosome Mapping; Escherichia coli; Escherichia coli Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Genes, Regulator; Genome, Bacterial; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Salt Stress; Sequence Inversion; Temperature; Transcription Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073721471

Other ecosystem services can be ecosystem dependent and are in part regulated by local-scale decision-making. In the southwestern United States, ongoing climate change is exacerbating a legacy of fire-exclusion that has altered forest structure and increased high-severity wildfire risk. Management can mitigate this risk by reducing forest density and restoring frequent surface fires, but at the cost of reduced carbon stocks. We sought to quantify the role of management in building adaptive capacity to projected climate and wildfires and the carbon consequences in a forested watershed. We simulated carbon dynamics under projected climate and wildfires and two management scenarios: prioritized and optimized. The prioritized scenario involved thinning and prescribed burning in areas selected by stakeholders to mitigate high-severity wildfire risk. The optimized scenario used the probability of high-severity wildfires to locate thinning treatments and increased prescribed fire area burned relative to the prioritized scenario. Both scenarios reduced wildfire severity and significantly increased net photosynthesis relative to no-management. However, the optimized scenario decreased management-related losses by 2.4 Mg • C • ha−1 and wildfire emissions by 2.9 Mg • C • ha−1 relative to the prioritized scenario. By decreasing the area thinned and increasing the area burned relative to the prioritized scenario, the optimized scenario halved the time to realize a net carbon benefit relative to no-management. Given the increasing climatic and disturbance pressures impacting southwestern forests, management will play a critical role in building adaptive capacity and ensuring the continued provision of ecosystem services. ©2019.

Yet high-resolution emission data are often missing or contain large uncertainties especially for the developing regions. Taking advantage of long-term satellite measurements of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), here we develop a computationally efficient method of estimating NOx emissions in major urban areas at the 0.05° × 0.05° resolution. The top-down inversion method accounts for the nonlinear effects of horizontal transport, chemical loss, and deposition. We construct a two-dimensional Peking University High-resolution Lifetime-Emission-Transport model (PHLET), its adjoint model (PHLET-A), and a satellite conversion matrix approach to relate emissions, lifetimes, simulated NO2, and satellite NO2 data. The inversion method is applied to the summer months of 2012-2015 in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD; 29-34° N, 118-123° E) area, a major polluted region of China, using the NO2 vertical column density data from the Peking University Ozone Monitoring Instrument NO2 product (POMINO). A systematic analysis of inversion errors is performed, including using an independent test based on GEOS-Chem simulations. Across the YRD area, the summer average emissions obtained in this work range from 0 to 15.3 kg km-2 h-1, and the lifetimes (due to chemical loss and deposition) range from 0.6 to 3.3 h. Our emission dataset reveals fine-scale spatial information related to nighttime light, population density, road network, maritime shipping, and land use (from a Google Earth photo).

Quantitative understanding of dust emission from crusted surfaces is limited, because (1) theories on dust emission are not well tested for such surfaces; and (2) modelling is hampered by a lack of input data sufficient to describe the surface conditions. Combining detailed field measurements with physics-based numerical modelling, we present new insights into dust emission from crusted surfaces. Our measurements confirm that crust erodibility and dust-emission intensity can increase or decrease after previous erosion events. To support interpretation of the measurements and to test the applicability of a state-of-the-art parameterisation to simulate dust emission from crusted surfaces, we apply the dust emission scheme of Shao (2004). Saltation flux, which is input to the scheme, is approximated using the parameterisation of Kawamura (1964) and a scaling factor obtained from observations. Limitations of this approach are discussed. Our results show that the dust emission scheme is suitable to estimate dust emission from crusted surfaces if accurate input data and parameters describing the soil-surface condition are provided. The parameters were optimized for each dust event to achieve a best estimate. The variation of the resulting parameter values confirms the observed variability of dust-emission efficiency between the events and provides further evidence that it was caused by variations in crust erodibility. Our study demonstrates that available physics-based dust-emission parameterisations are able to simulate dust emissions under complicated conditions, but also that refined information on the soil-surface conditions are needed as input to the schemes. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,"dust; emission; erodibility; measurement method; mineral; numerical model; soil erosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066395095

It focuses on the German fiscal policy to promote the sale of the so-called Clean Cars during the mid-1980s. We concluded that the regulation proposed by European Commission in the field of competition and environmental protection law successfully solved the clash between legitimate goals around emissions regulations. It covers implication in terms of normative order; political objectives coherency; firms’ profit strategies and relationships between firms and regulators through European trade associations.

Evidence from regional scale studies suggests that foliar fungal symbiont distributions are influenced both by plant hosts and environmental variation in climate and soil resources. However, previous surveys have focused on either one plant host across an environmental gradient or one gradient and multiple plant hosts, making it difficult to disentangle the influence of host identity from the influence of the environment on foliar endophyte communities. We used a culture-based approach to survey fungal symbiont composition in the leaves of nine C3 grass species along replicated elevation gradients in grasslands of the Colorado Rocky Mountains. In these ecosystems, the taxonomic richness and composition of foliar fungal symbionts were mostly structured by the taxonomic identity of the plant host rather than by variation in climate. Plant traits related to size (height and leaf length) were the best predictors of foliar fungal symbiont composition and diversity, and composition did not vary predictably with plant evolutionary history. The largest plants had the most diverse and distinctive fungal communities. These results suggest that across the ~ 300 m elevation range that we sampled, foliar fungal symbionts may indirectly experience climate change by tracking the shifting distributions of plant hosts rather than tracking climate directly. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","C3 grass; Climate; Epichloë; Foliar endophytes; Horizontally transmitted endophytic fungi; Microbiome; Mountain ecosystems; Plant host","classification; climate change; Colorado; ecosystem; endophyte; fungus; genetics; isolation and purification; microbiology; mycobiome; phylogeny; physiology; plant leaf; plant physiology; Poaceae; symbiosis; Climate Change; Colorado; Ecosystem; Endophytes; Fungi; Mycobiome; Phylogeny; Plant Leaves; Plant Physiological Phenomena; Poaceae; Symbiosis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061101020

A transition from fossil fuels to renewables-based sources of energy is one positive step in reducing the greenhouse gases from the energy supply system, which currently requires long-distance transport of diesel for electricity and heating needs. Geothermal energy can not only displace diesel for part of this energy need, it can provide a base-load source of local energy to support food production and mitigate adverse impacts of food insecurity on communities. In this proof-of-concept study, we highlight some potential benefits of using geothermal energy to serve Canada's northern communities. Specifically, we focus on food security and evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of producing vegetables in a ""controlled environment"", using ground sources of heat for energy requirements at three remote locations-Resolute Bay, Nunavut, as well as Moosonee and Pagwa in Ontario. The system is designed for geothermal district heating combined with efficient use of nutrients, water, and heat to yield a diverse crop of vegetables at an average cost up to 50% lower than the current cost of these vegetables delivered to Resolute Bay. The estimates of thermal energy requirements vary by location (e.g., they are in the range of 41 to 44 kW of thermal energy for a single greenhouse in Resolute Bay). To attain adequate system size to support the operation of such greenhouses, it is expected that up to 15% of the annually recommended servings of vegetables can be provided. Our comparative analysis of geothermal system capital costs shows significantly lower capital costs in Southern Ontario compared to Northern Canada-lower by one-third. Notwithstanding high capital costs, our study demonstrates the technical and economic feasibility of producing vegetables cost-effectively in the cold northern climate. This suggests that geothermal energy systems can supply the heat needed for greenhouse applications in remote northern regions, supplying a reliable and robust source of cost-competitive sustainable energy over the long-term and providing a basis for improved food security and economic empowerment of communities. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Cold and remote regions; Economic development; Food security; Geothermal; Greenhouse; Renewable and sustainable energy","Climate change; Costs; Diesel engines; Energy conservation; Food supply; Fossil fuels; Geothermal fields; Geothermal wells; Greenhouse gases; Greenhouses; Sustainable development; Thermal energy; Thermal processing (foods); Vegetables; Economic development; Food security; Geothermal; Remote regions; Sustainable energy; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074880239

Game-changing opportunities for water stressed regions are emerging with new emissions reduction strategies and energy options. These have particular significance for socio-economic development pathways in the marginal drought-prone regions. In this paper, we explore the energy-water-environment nexus in watersheds undergoing acute water stress and energy transitions in the Arab region and the Horn of Africa. A review of published and ongoing scientific activity was used to elaborate four case studies and identify common trade-offs between objectives to reduce water stress, increase productivity and lower energy costs and emissions. The available scientific evidence base for assessment of these trade-offs was then compared via a discursive process amongst review team members. Collectively, the case studies present a state of the art in available geoscientific methods currently applied in the Arab region to quantify nexus trade-offs for decision-making concerning increasing groundwater use, water harvesting and wastewater reuse across the case studies. The review pursues the wider geographic relevance and scope of this emerging scientific agenda. It identifies global opportunities to boost and progressively enhance the geoscientific information bases for decision-making in the most water stressed regions, as well as direct comparisons with emerging discussion in the Horn of Africa region. Insights for sustainable development decision-makers are highlighted and further scope for the transfer of insights within and beyond the Arab region are discussed. © 2019, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Drought; Energy; Trade-offs; Water; Water stress","decision making; drought; groundwater; sustainable development; trade-environment relations; trade-off; urban region; urbanization; wastewater; wastewater treatment; water stress; watershed; Horn of Africa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073613268

Cities are developing climate change action plans (CCAPs) focusing their efforts on reducing GHG emissions and adapting to climate change impacts. Despite having the highest urban population in the world, there are a few studies on urban CCAPs in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) region. This study assessed the level of integration of mitigation and adaptation (IMA) in urban climate change plans across 44 major LAC cities. The level of IMA was measured by the utilization of the IMA index, a comprehensive evaluation framework of indicators. The results showed that more than half of the examined LAC cities have a moderate level of IMA. The study further explored and statistically analyzed 42 institutional, socioeconomic and environmental factors to identify which ones potentially drive or constrain the level of IMA. Five out of 42 factors were found to have a significant impact (p-value < 0.05) on the IMA index. Of the five significant factors, memberships in regional networks FLACMA and UCCI respectively, and donor agencies' contribution to the development of urban policies had a positive impact on IMA index; while the national climate fund and membership in the global network Urban LEDS had a negative impact. This suggests that cities are most likely to integrate mitigation and adaptation when the development of their CCAPs are supported by donor agencies or collaborating with other cities. The results highlight the important role of donor agencies, international organizations and cities' networks on providing the necessary capacity to cities for addressing climate change in an integrated manner. © 2019 The Author(s).

As an example of human-engineered infrastructure that enhances the sustainability and resilience of coastal social-ecological systems (SES), we have presented the dumbeong system, a farmer-engineered and managed irrigation system based on Korean traditional ecological knowledge. We analyzed the spatial relationship of dumbeongs with coastal landscape attributes and droughts in Goseong County in South Korea. We used generalized linear models (GLMs) to examine the effects of land cover and recent (2001–2010) standardized precipitation index (SPI) on the abundance of dumbeongs. Then, we projected near future (2020–2050) changes in the SPI-based drought risk for the dumbeong system using representative concentration pathway (RCP) climate scenarios. We found that forest and marine water areas have positive relations with dumbeong abundance, whereas SPI has a negative relation, indicating that the dumbeongs are more abundant in areas close to sea water and forests, and with higher incidences of drought. Derived climate change scenarios show that the study region will experience higher incidence of drought. Our findings provide empirical evidence for the dumbeong system as an effective community designed and driven adaptive response to local hydrological processes and climatic conditions, and as climate-resilient infrastructure that strengthens sustainability and resilience of coastal SES. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for sustainable landscape management and optimal use of the dumbeong system in coastal regions. © 2019 The Authors","Climate change; Climate-resilient infrastructure; Coastal social-ecological systems; Dumbeong; Farmer-managed irrigation system; Resilience Traditional ecological knowledge","Drought; Ecology; Forestry; Irrigation; Risk perception; Seawater; Sustainable development; Climate-resilient infrastructure; Dumbeong; Farmer managed irrigation systems; Social-ecological systems; Traditional ecological knowledge; Climate change; sea water; anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate effect; coastal zone; coastal zone management; environmental management; farmers knowledge; future prospect; infrastructural development; irrigation system; spatial analysis; traditional knowledge; Article; climate change; coastal waters; drought; ecosystem resilience; environmental sustainability; forest; hydrology; irrigation (agriculture); land use; landscape ecology; marine environment; priority journal; seashore; social adaptation; South Korea; spatial analysis; agriculture; ecosystem; environmental protection; human; procedures; social aspects and related phenomena; Goseong; South Korea; South Kyongsang; Agricultural Irrigation; Agriculture; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Droughts; Ecosystem; Forests; Humans; Republic of Korea; Sociological Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069808309

However, food systems and how we interact with them, offer tangible opportunities to respond to these environmental concerns in small but meaningful ways. By examining the impact of our food consumption, we are provided with an opportunity for ongoing self-assessment. To engage in this self-assessment as part of a community of practice, we argue, is all the more impactful. This paper is self-reflective, exploring the process and outcomes of a group of non-experts working together to develop a workshop to explore the politics of everyday eating. This workshop took the form of a seven-course meal. To disquiet this indulgence, these seven courses included both food for physical sustenance and food to provoke hearts and minds, because ‘we don’t usually think of what we eat as a matter of ethics’ (Singer and Mason, 2007: 3). The three food courses were sourced and cooked for conference participants by the authors of this paper. While undertaking these activities, we debated and documented our sourcing decisions and mused on the role of food in Aotearoa New Zealand. The remaining four courses served our guests the critical musings of food rescuers, local food producers and other food thinkers to cleanse the palate by way of presentations, poetry and performances. By using a meal as our methodology, we, as non-expert organizers and chefs, sought to explore our own, and allow others to explore their food consumption and ethics. © The Author(s) 2019.","autoethnography; community of practice; experiential learning; Food politics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85060608162

Using nonlocal Rayleigh and Timoshenko beam models, the discrete and continuous versions of equations of motion of magnetically affected nanosystems are derived. Commonly, the discrete models suffer from both labor costs and computational efforts for highly populated nanosystems. To conquer these special deficiencies of discrete nanosystems, appropriate continuous models have been established and their efficiency in capturing frequencies of discrete models is proved. The roles of wavenumber, radius of SWCNTs, magnetic field strength, nonlocality, and intertube distance in flexural and shear frequencies as well as their corresponding phase and group velocities are displayed and discussed. The obtained results confirm this fact that the longitudinal magnetic field could be employed as an efficient way to control characteristics of both flexural and shear waves in periodic jungles of SWCNTs. © 2019, The Brazilian Society of Mechanical Sciences and Engineering.","Assumed mode method; Control of transverse waves; Longitudinal magnetic field; Nonlocal elasticity theory; Periodic jungles of SWCNTs","Computation theory; Elasticity; Equations of motion; Longitudinal control; Magnetic fields; Nanosystems; Nanotubes; Shear flow; Shear waves; Wages; Assumed-mode method; Longitudinal magnetic fields; Non-local elasticity theories; Periodic jungles of SWCNTs; Transverse waves; Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCN)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073034053

This study included development of zero-dimensional model of a 2.0 L turbocharged diesel engine and then study the effects of changing its compression ratio in the numerical model. This paper gave a framework in determining the effect of compression ratios in different operational conditions of the engine. Implementation of variable compression ratio technology on a numerical model proved to be very cost-effective, time saving and validated the fact that numerical models can be used to study different parameters of the engines during the development stage. The main effect of an increase in compression ratio, was found to be as expected, a decrease in brake specific fuel consumption and an increase in thermal efficiency with a greater impact at low rpm-low load regions. Assuming, that the variable compression ratio technology can be utilized in the engine, this work found the best combination of compression ratios around the engine map, giving a best fit of trade-offs between the emissions and performance of the engine. This study also validates the fact that variable compression ratio technology, if implemented in the engine could not only reduce emissions of the engine but can be given as an option to the end-user to switch to more economic fuel consumption values during idling or cruising at long distant journeys. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Combustion; Emissions; Internal combustion engine; Numerical modelling; Variable compression ratio; Zero dimensional","Cost effectiveness; Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Engine cylinders; Greenhouse effect; Laws and legislation; Numerical models; Brake specific fuel consumption; Consumption values; Emission legislation; Emissions regulations; Operational conditions; Turbocharged diesel engine; Variable compression ratio; Zero-dimensional models; Compression ratio (machinery)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097052441

This issue is particularly relevant for traits related to growth and anti-herbivore defence of plants, because both sets of traits are closely tied to fitness, and because being sessile organisms, plants tend to experience strong local selection. Despite widespread recognition that the abiotic environment imposes selection on plant traits, how temperature and water availability independently select for allocation to growth and defence against herbivores is not well-resolved, and even more so, when considering under-ground herbivory and tritrophic interactions involving plant herbivores and their predators. To address heritable, climate-driven variation in root traits mediating tritrophic interactions, we performed a common garden experiment with four populations of common red fescue (Festuca rubra) encompassing the four corners of a precipitation by temperature gradient matrix. We found that plants originating from wetter and warmer conditions, in addition to producing more biomass, also produced a blend of volatile organic compounds more attractive for predatory nematodes of root insect herbivores. Moreover, across populations, variation in nematode attraction was mediated by balancing the emissions of attractive and repulsive volatile compounds. Our work builds towards better understanding how plant adaptation to climate interacts with adaptations to herbivores and their predators.

Very few studies have assessed carbon pools in old-growth Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.)-dominated boreal forests, and none have been conducted in hemiboreal forests. Therefore, we assessed the carbon storage of the living tree biomass, deadwood, forest floor (soil organic horizon, including all litter and decomposed wood), and mineral soil in 25 hemiboreal old-growth (163-218 years) unmanaged Scots pine stands in Latvia. The studied stands were without known records of any major natural or human-made disturbance in the visible past. Our results show, that the total ecosystem carbon pool (excluding ground vegetation) was 291.2 ± 54.2 Mg C ha-1, which was primarily composed of living tree biomass (59%), followed by mineral soil (31%), deadwood (5%), and the forest floor (5%). Within the studied stand age group, the total carbon pool remained stable; however, interchanges among the carbon pools, i.e., living biomass and laying deadwood, did occur. © 2019 by the authors.","Above- and below-ground tree biomass; Deadwood; Forest floor; Mineral soil; Over-mature forest; Pinus sylvestris; Semi-natural forest","Biodiversity; Biomass; Climate change; Ecosystems; Floors; Lakes; Minerals; Soils; Deadwood; Forest floors; Mature forest; Mineral soils; Pinus sylvestris; Semi-natural forests; Tree biomass; Forestry; aboveground biomass; belowground biomass; boreal forest; carbon; coniferous forest; dead wood; forest ecosystem; forest floor; forest soil; Biodiversity; Biomass; Ecosystems; Floors; Lakes; Minerals; Latvia; Pinus sylvestris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073455844

However, it remains unclear how different governance processes can coordinate competing resource uses despite incoherence of institutional resource regimes. This paper examines how institutional resource regimes and polycentric governance processes are co-evolving and to what extent these processes coordinate competing resource uses in incoherent resource regimes. Empirically, we performed an embedded case study of the institutional resource regime and governance processes of three water reservoir projects with contrasting outcomes in the region of Oberhasli in the canton of Berne, Switzerland, covering a timeframe starting from the early 20th century. Data were collected through 21 semi-structured interviews, document analysis, participatory observation, and transect walks. Analytically, we demonstrate how the combination of the Institutional Resource Regime and polycentric governance frameworks provides an opportunity to analyze co-evolving resource regimes and governance processes. The results show that the institutional resource regime has become increasingly incoherent over the past decades, but the evolution of polycentric processes to govern competing water uses compensated for regime incoherence. Polycentric governance improved the coordination of water uses, if mutual adjustment, trust and activation of overarching rules between actors with similar and opposing interests were present. We conclude that institutional regime incoherence may constitute a critical barrier to climate change adaptation, but polycentric governance processes may alleviate critical challenges arising from regime incoherence. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Coordination; Institutional Resource Regime; Local regulatory arrangement; Polycentric governance; Water","Article; case study; climate change; compensation; evolutionary adaptation; glacier; government; history; methodology; priority journal; semi structured interview; Switzerland; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068475239

This study examines benefits from the renewable energy utilization support program that subsidized household purchase and installation of thermal solar panels. This review of synergy between energy, climate, and air quality policies focuses on solar panel subsidies funded through the European Union and county governments in Mazowieckie Voivodship in Poland. County government offices, using the unpublished list of households receiving subsidies for thermal solar panel installation, mediated in the implementation of the survey and collected 123 completed questionnaires in May and June 2015. The heteroscedasticity-corrected OLS estimates two equations identifying and quantifying factors influencing the purchase price of solar panels and rural household monthly energy bill savings after installation using the gathered data. Among sociodemographic variables, increasing age was associated with an increasing price paid for the panels, but education was associated with paying a lower price for solar panels and lower self-reported energy bill savings. Panel purchase price increased if the respondent was a farmer, viewed subsidies as important, and preferred domestically manufactured panels. Location of household increased the price as compared to the reference county. Savings on monthly energy bills increased if respondent had a positive view of solar energy, expected a decrease in the bill following the purchase of panels, and heated large areas in the house. Subsidy programs have been important in increased household solar energy utilization, especially among farm households, while self-reported energy bill savings increased with positive attitudes towards renewable energy and the larger heated areas in rural residences. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; Decarbonization; GHG emission; Purchase price; Solar energy; Survey","air quality; climate change; greenhouse gas; investment incentive; residential energy; rural population; solar power; age; agricultural worker; air quality; article; climate; education; European Union; government; household; human; human experiment; investment; Poland; questionnaire; solar energy; air pollution; climate; investment; renewable energy; Air Pollution; Climate; Humans; Investments; Poland; Renewable Energy; Solar Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070089525

However, how the prevailing housing practices are intertwined with rural livelihoods and how the external initiatives to promote disaster-resistant housing practices materialize in a contested marginalized space are key questions with social vulnerability implications that seldom receive adequate attention. This paper aims to explore these questions through case studies of two hazard-prone rural areas in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach: The two study areas were selected considering the variation of risk patterns: one located in cyclone hazard-prone southern District of Noakhali and the other located in a flood hazard-prone area of Rajbari District. Existing housing practices in these two communities, their adoption of disaster-resistant housing options and their overall livelihood challenges were explored through questionnaire surveys, focus group discussions and transect walks. Findings: As this study shows, safe housing practices are tertiary concerns for people living in those contested spaces after meeting livelihood challenges. Further, in the absence of formal land tenure, adaptation efforts that introduce disaster-resistant housing practices may fail to be effective. Practical implications: The findings of this study demonstrate the need for a reorientation in the present approaches of climate adaptation (particularly, in case of housing practice) to make them more responsive to the adaptation challenges of socially vulnerable populations. Originality/value: Most of the prior studies on disaster and rural housing have focused on the post-disaster housing recovery, but there is yet to have enough study that looked at households’ current housing strategies and, in particular, how land tenure and livelihood challenges influence their choices. This study fills this research gap and also provides evidence in support of considering the risk priority of marginalized vulnerable population while responding to the broader concerns of climate change. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.","Bangladesh; Climate adaptation; Livelihood; Natural hazards; Rural housing","adaptive management; climate change; developing world; disaster management; hazard assessment; housing provision; livelihood; natural hazard; questionnaire survey; rural area; vulnerability; Bangladesh",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074030681

This paper investigates the use of a hybrid photovoltaics, biomass and diesel to meet the energy needs of a grid-connected village, located in east of Iran. Because of unstable economic conditions and rapid changing of the economic factors in Iran, several possible rates of inflation and discount rates were considered to find an optimal scenario. Before identifying an optimal scenario, a comparison was made to determine which way of installing photovoltaic panels, as centralized plant or top-roof, will be more beneficial in the region. It was concluded that, when the inflation is 10% and discount rate is equal to 18% (most recent economic condition of Iran), the best scenario includes 63 kW photovoltaics, 10 kW biogas generator and 10 kW and 15 kW diesel generator, which could produce energy with 0.193 $/kWh. It was also concluded that with the changes in fuel prices, interest rates, and inflation rates within the reasonable range of expected economic conditions for the project lifetime, the energy cost of the optimal system will vary from 0.085 to 0.238 $/kWh. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biomass; Diesel; Energy economy; Hybrid system; Photovoltaic; Top-roof","Biomass; Diesel engines; Economic analysis; Hybrid systems; Optimal systems; Photovoltaic cells; Roofs; Rural areas; Diesel; Economic condition; Energy economy; Hybrid photovoltaics; Photovoltaic; Photovoltaic panels; Suitable solutions; Technical analysis; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069563505

A method to improve stability of lean combustion while maintaining low thermal NOx formation is to add hydrogen in typical gas turbine fuels such as natural gas. The present work examines the thermoacoustic dynamic characteristics of hydrogen-enriched methane blends in a swirl stabilized model gas turbine combustor. We blend CH4 with increasing H2 molar content (from 0% to 40%) at a global equivalence ratio of ϕ=0.55 on a constant Reynolds number Re = 19000. The reference case of pure methane is susceptible to blow off at the same equivalence ratio. On increasing the hydrogen content at 10% H2, the flammability limits are extended. However, further increase of the H2 content leads to manifestation of random short bursts of dynamic pressure and heat release. Thermoacoustic dynamics are intermittently injected between a quiescent state and a regime of high amplitude oscillations. On further increasing H2 content, the dynamics are attracted towards a limit cycle; a fully established high amplitude regime, where no requiescence is observed. In this regime, heat release rate and dynamic pressure oscillate in phase and at the same frequency. Based on the observed dynamics, we seek a mixture property to characterize the dynamic state, the combustor operates in. We show that the extinction strain rate associated with each mixture can collapse the dynamic transitions from quiescent to intermittent instabilities and finally to fully established thermoacoustic oscillations. In each dynamic state, we examine the mechanism that affiliates coherent structures of the underlying thermodynamic flow field with the flame through the relation of the spatial distribution of the flow imposed strain rate over the extinction strain rate of each mixture. It is shown that the flame anchoring locations for a given mixture are dictated by the flow imposed strain rate and then that increased extinction resistance couples the flame with naturally excited to swirling flows helical instabilities, that may instigate mechanisms responsible for intermittent heat release rate bursts. Finally, the combustor demonstrates a limit cycle behaviour where the flow-imposed strain rate oscillates about the extinction strain rate along the inner shear layers causing local extinction of the flame at the root close to the centerbody. © 2019","Dynamic Mode Decomposition; Extinction strain rate; Methane/hydrogen enrichment","Combustion; Combustors; Flame resistance; Fuel burners; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Heat resistance; Hydrogen; Hydrogen fuels; Methane; Mixtures; Molar ratio; Nitrogen oxides; Plasma oscillations; Reynolds number; Shear flow; Thermoacoustics; Dynamic characteristics; Dynamic mode decompositions; Extinction strain rate; Global equivalence ratio; Heat Release Rate (HRR); Lean premixed combustion; Thermoacoustic instability; Thermoacoustic oscillations; Strain rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067940978

The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from landfills contribute to global climate change. Emissions from this sector contribute around 3% of total net emissions in Australia. Although responsible for a minor portion of Australia’s emissions, the sector provides the opportunity for low-cost sources of abatement. This research study aimed to identify new opportunities for reducing GHG emissions from the landfill waste stream in public facilities in Blacktown City in New South Wales, Australia. For this purpose, two public facilities of different types were selected, a library and an aquatic center. The results of the study show that removing organic food waste from the landfill stream at 10 public facilities of the Council could reduce GHG emissions compared with landfilling the food waste by about 0.805 tCO2e/year. However, separately transporting that waste would emit 7.13 tCO2e/year. Therefore, the separated food waste would need to be processed on-site, for example, through worm farms. Removing coffee cups from the landfill waste stream could reduce the associated landfill GHG emissions by around 0.275 tCO2e/y for the 10 public facilities. The study also recommended separating plastic bags from the landfill waste stream of these facilities to reduce 1.10 tonnes of plastic bags from landfill each year. Implications: Potential opportunities for general waste reduction and GHG emission mitigation in public facilities has been studied in this paper. Removing coffee cups and organics food from the waste stream are the main potential opportunities for reducing general waste with possible GHG emission reduction of 0.275 tCO2e/y and 0.161 tCO2/y respectively for 10 public facilities. Removing plastic bags from the waste stream would offer another solution for waste reduction by jointing with the large program running in Australia and creating a collection point for them with 1.1 tonne/y mitigation in general waste at 10 studied public facilities. © 2019, © 2019 A&WMA.",,"Climate change; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Plastic containers; Ghg emission mitigations; Global climate changes; Landfill wastes; Municipal solid waste (MSW); New South Wales , Australia; Public facilities; Research studies; Waste reduction; Municipal solid waste; agricultural land; article; carbon footprint; coffee; food waste; landfill; New South Wales; organic food; quantitative analysis; running; food; greenhouse gas; library; procedures; sanitation; solid waste; swimming pool; waste management; Food; Greenhouse Gases; Libraries; New South Wales; Public Facilities; Solid Waste; Swimming Pools; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071030215

Neglection of reflections in the tomography process was found to lead to overestimation of the emission near the wall surfaces by up to a factor of 4, as well as to formation of bright emission artifacts between the main emission regions and the wall surfaces, comprising locally up to 50% of the emission. Mimicking divertor spectroscopy measurements by integrating the tomographic reconstructions along vertical lines-of-sight implies that reflections comprise 15%-25% of the observed line-integrated emission peaks. The spatial differences in the reflection contribution between the different lines-of-sight are less pronounced than in the 2D reconstructions due to the dominance of the brightest emission regions through which the spectroscopic lines-of-sight pass. However, postprocessing EDGE2D-EIRENE simulations using the CHERAB code and synthetic spectroscopy suggests a decrease of the spectroscopically inferred divertor electron temperature by up to 75%, when redistribution of the observed light due to reflections is considered. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Cameras; Fusion reactor divertors; Repair; Tomography; 2D reconstruction; Integrated emissions; Reduction of emissions; Spatial accuracy; Spatial differences; Spectroscopic measurements; Spectroscopy measurements; Tomographic reconstruction; Image reconstruction; article; artifact; simulation; spectroscopy; tomography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073599826

Within the marine realm, ocean acidification, or the global decline in seawater pH, remains a pervasive threat to organisms and ecosystems. Natural variability in seawater carbon dioxide (CO2) chemistry, however, presents an opportunity to identify ocean acidification refugia (OAR) for marine species. Here, we review the literature to examine the impacts of variable CO2 chemistry on biological responses to ocean acidification and develop a framework of definitions and criteria that connects current OAR research to management goals. Under the concept of managing vulnerability, the most likely mechanisms by which OAR can mitigate ocean acidification impacts are by reducing exposure to harmful conditions or enhancing adaptive capacity. While local management options, such as OAR, show some promise, they present unique challenges, and reducing global anthropogenic CO2 emissions must remain a priority. © 2019 The Authors Global Change Biology Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","adaptive capacity; biological response; management; mitigation; ocean acidification; pH variability; refugia; vulnerability","adaptive management; carbon dioxide; climate change; global change; mitigation; ocean acidification; pH; refuge; vulnerability; carbon dioxide; sea water; climate change; ecosystem; pH; refugium; sea; Carbon Dioxide; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Oceans and Seas; Refugium; Seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070465844

In the last few decades, there was a significant change in the gaseous composition of earth's atmosphere, mainly through increased energy use in industry and agriculture sectors, viz. deforestation, intensive cultivation, land use change, management practices, etc. These activities lead to increase the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), etc., popularly known as the ""greenhouse gases"" (GHGs), and rise up the temperature. These GHGs cause regional and global changes in the climate-related parameters such as rainfall, soil moisture, and sea level. Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projected temperature rise from 0.5 to 1.2 ° C by 2020, 0.88 to 3.16 °C by 2050, and 1.56-5.44 °C by 2080 for India. To mitigate this climate change, among the different means, soil is also one of the key components of the agricultural production system, and it needs to be relooked in the view of the environment. Soil not only acts as a sink for GHGs but also as a source from agriculture. In this regard, concerted efforts are necessary for adverse climate change impact to reduce the vulnerability of agriculture. To meet out these issues, sources and mitigation options for individual gases from the soil are discussed in this chapter. Sources of CH4 emission are due to microbial decomposition of soil organic matter (SOM) under the submerged condition, burning of crop residue, and the enteric fermentation. The N2O is through fertilizers by the process of nitrification and denitrification. The major carbon (C) sources are tillage, burning of crop residue, and fossil fuel combustion. To overcome the emission of GHGs from the soil, the nature of the release of individual gas and its specific management can give an idea of sustaining soil health to safeguard the environment. Hence, reducing these GHGs emission from the soil through light to overcome the climate change effect. Reduction of CH4 gas mainly from rice can be done by the adoption of intermittent irrigation, planting methods, fertilizer type, etc. Nitrification inhibitors from plant-derived organics such as neem oil, neem cake, and Karanja seed extract could also reduce the N2O emission. Also, the demand-driven nitrogen (N) application using a leaf colour chart (LCC) reduces N2O emission. By using legume crops in rotation helps to reduce the N2O emission besides fixing long time C in the belowground. To reduce CO2 emission from the agriculture, sequestering C through agroforestry system, conservation agriculture, perennial crops, etc. could be the effective strategies for assimilating and storing C for a long time in soil. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Carbon dioxide; Environment; Methane; Mitigation; Nitrous oxide; Soil; Sources",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089168391

Perceived behavioural control was, however, found to be insignificant. The impact of past behaviour, environmental concerns, modernity, and government's role on perceived behavioural control then suggested the importance of these factors in ease of adaptability. The results of this study add to the wealth of information on the low carbon society in Malaysia by combining different variables that are significant determinants of citizens' intention to engage in low carbon activities. It also provides an important piece of information for Malaysian policy-makers to consider for low carbon society preparation; programs such as environmental awareness, policy interventions such as subsidies, and new technologies. Overall, the results of this study make it clear that the introduction of strategies and policies in Malaysia that concentrate on social contribution of all citizens from government to businesses and households is most likely to be successful in the move towards a low carbon society. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Citizens' intention; Extended theory of planned behaviour; Low carbon society; Social contribution","Environmental management; Environmental technology; Public policy; Citizens' intention; Environmental awareness; Environmental concerns; Government to business; Low-carbon societies; Perceived behavioural controls; Social contribution; Theory of planned behaviour; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068693061

Borders between neighbourhoods are mostly socially repulsive as they usually host large residual and underutilized spaces such as oversized main roads and other infrastructure elements. Consequently, these residual areas constitute large breaks in the neighbourhoods' building pattern and physical barriers for the inhabitants. Since we see a great potential in these residual areas, we have elaborated a planning tool which is generally applicable for sustainable development of transitional spaces between neighbourhoods. This study demonstrates different strategies on how these urban thresholds between neighbourhoods can be transformed into central active mixed-use public spaces that will be reachable for all residents by walking. Accordingly, they can promote for social interaction between different neighbourhoods and thus social sustainability. Within this paper, at first, the thresholds between different residential neighbourhoods' structures are examined to better understand their qualities and deficits. Secondly, various sustainable development options for the threshold areas are demonstrated. An exemplary site in the Capital Area of Muscat, Oman serves as a case study. The third part consists of an evaluation of the elaborated proposals according to their ecological, social and economical efficiency in order to create adequate implementation strategies. Finally, we propose that the ecological solutions for residual areas as developed in this paper for the GCC region can be expanded to other hot-climate countries as a planning tool to achieve sustainable built environments by connecting different neighbourhoods. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

However, political ecology researchers demonstrate that tropical forests are complex socioecological systems where humans and institutions play an integral role in shaping landscapes. The current framing overlooks the net effect of traditional subsistence agriculturalists leaving behind low emission lifestyles, despite the likelihood of a significant increase in per capita emissions over time. In this case study, we use the history of forest use in the Pueblos Mancomunados—a commonwealth of indigenous communities in Oaxaca, Mexico—to explore sequestration through a socioecological systems lens. As negative emissions programs consider afforestation, we triangulated semistructured interviews, an unsupervised GIS classification of land cover, and a review of carbon dioxide emissions to consider out-migration, abandonment, and lifestyle change. We find that communities are struggling to maintain livelihoods as migration to urban centers and the United States continues. Meanwhile, spatial analysis revealed 800 ha of afforestation. Our analysis of out-migration scenarios and per capita emissions changes identified a tipping point in which no net-sequestration would occur from afforestation due to the changing lifestyles of the migrants and recommend improved local development to avoid this form of “leakage” when assessing global carbon stocks. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","deforestation; leakage; Negative emissions; rural flight; sequestration","Carbon dioxide; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Global warming; Leakage (fluid); Carbon dioxide emissions; Forest preservation; Indigenous community; Net sequestration; Payments for ecosystem services; Semi structured interviews; sequestration; Socio-ecological systems; Reforestation; afforestation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; deforestation; ecosystem service; forest management; leakage; reforestation; rural-urban migration; Carbon Dioxide; Chelation; Commonwealth; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Reforestation; Mexico [North America]; Oaxaca; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064605394

To better understand high-pollution events in this region, the synoptic weather patterns associated with springtime non-dust high PM10 (High PM10) events and Asian Dust events in Seoul, South Korea, are examined for the 2001–2018 period. It is shown that the two high-pollution events accompany different atmospheric circulations. While High PM10 events are associated with weak surface cyclonic circulations over the Southeast China, Asian Dust events are characterized by strong cyclones over Northeast China. Composite weather maps show that mid-tropospheric circulation anomalies are exactly the opposite between the two events with anticyclonic anomalies over the Korean Peninsula for High PM10 events but cyclonic anomalies for Asian Dust events. The cluster analyses further reveal that High PM10 events are not determined by a single dominant weather pattern. They are associated with surface cyclonic circulations from southeastern China to the Sea of Okhotsk, anticyclonic circulations around the Korean Peninsula or their mixtures.

Rational design of semiconductor photocatalysts with unique structures may be promising to break this bottleneck.

Thanks to the bismuth rich strategy, the highly dispersed band structure and the elevated conduction band (CB) potential facilitate the charge transfer and photoreduction ability. Meanwhile, hollow structure provides the large specific area and creates a resonance in its interior to enhance the CO2 adsorption and activation. Benefiting from the collaborative promotion effect, the local charge arrangement and electronic structure are tuned so as to an exceptional efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 conversion into CO (3.16 μmol g−1 h−1) and CH4 (0.5 μmol g−1 h−1) is attained over hollow Bi4O5Br2, which is superior to that of solid Bi4O5Br2 and BiOBr, as well as other reported Bi-based photocatalysts.

The Mongolian Plateau (MP) is located at the mid-latitude arid/semiarid climate region, which is deemed as the most sensitive region in response to global climate change. In order to understand the spatiotemporal characteristics of droughts in Mongolian Plateau under changing climate, we divided the study area into three climatic regions via Köppen climate classification. Then, the seasonal and annual drought trends were analyzed by standardized precipitation evaporation index (SPEI), which is a function of monthly mean temperatures, highest temperatures, lowest temperatures and precipitations, collected from the 184 meteorological stations from 1980 to 2015. Mann-Kendall (MK) test was employed to detect if there is an abrupt change of annual drought, while the empirical orthogonal function method (EOF) was adopted to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of droughts across the Mongolian Plateau. Results from MK test illustrated that the SPEI-12 exhibited statistically significant downward trends (a < 0.05) for all three climatic regions of the Mongolian Plateau.EOF spatial analysis indicated that Region III experienced the most severe drought from 1980 to 2015. During the 35 years period, an abrupt change of drought was detected in 1999. Before year 1999, the climate was relatively humid. However, the entire region became more arid after year 1999, reflected by remarkably increased frequency and intensity of drought. SPEI-3 revealed the trend of drought at seasonal scale. We found that drought became more severe in spring, summer, and fall seasons for the entire MP. However, winter became more humid. Different climate regions exhibited quite different drought seasonality: Region I experienced a severe arid trend in summer and fall. For Region II and III, summer became more arid. All three regions became more humid in winter season, especially for Region I, with the Sen's slope of 0.0241/a. © 2019 by the authors.","Climatic regions; Drought; Mongolian Plateau; Spatiotemporal variation characteristics; SPEI","climate conditions; climate modeling; drought stress; empirical orthogonal function analysis; semiarid region; spatial variation; temporal variation; weather station; Cagayan Valley; Central Luzon; Ilocos; Mongolian Plateau; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073803261

To better utilize the subsurface space, the migration of CO2 in a supercritical state was modelled for a span of 10,000 days. The modelling results show that it is possible to inject CO2 into UCG cavities for storage.

However, catalysts in traditional direct methanol fuel cell associating with disordered electrode are prone to agglomerate, lowering energy conversion efficiency. Herein, we focus on order-structured catalyst layer by presenting a two-dimensional, two-phase, steady-state model to shed light on the ordered direct methanol fuel cells. The model considers both radial and axial transports of oxygen along the carbon nanowire in the order-structured cathode catalyst layer. The radial diffusion model simulates the oxygen transfer from the gas pore to the triple-phase boundary of the cylindrical electrode covered by a water film. The model also accounts for the effects of electrochemical surface areas of catalysts and the volume fraction of three phases. The whole-cell model formed by integrating those in different regions is solved numerically and validated against the experimental data in the literature. It is demonstrated that the direct methanol fuel cell with ordered electrode yields a better cell performance, 46.6% and 62.5% higher than that with agglomerate electrode in terms of peak power density and maximum current density, respectively, implying the improved energy efficiency. The better performance of the ordered electrode is attributed to the lowered activation, ohmic and concentration losses. Overall effect of the structural parameters indicates that the peak power density of the ordered direct methanol fuel cell can reach 93.86 mW cm−2 when carbon nanowire radius, carbon loading and Pt loading are set at 45 nm, 2.0 mg cm−2 and 1.6 mg cm−2, respectively.

However, most of the previous research studies concentrated on the use of one of the elements such as carbon or silicon. In order to fully recycle RHs, here, we report a novel hydrothermal process to develop Mn3O4/manganese silicate/C nanostructured composites using RHs as the raw materials. The as-prepared materials possess well- developed porosity with a high specific surface area because of the biomass-derived carbon.

A rapid, nondestructive, and economical detection method needs to be developed. A near-infrared hyperspectral imaging (HSI) system with a wavelength range of 874 to 1734 nm was used to measure the soil samples from Songyang County, Zhejiang Province, China. Totally, 198 samples were classified into four different texture groups: clay, clay loam, loam, and sand, based on the International Soil Science Society standard. The optimal wavelengths were selected by the method of competitive adaptive reweighted sampling. The texture features (contrast, correlation, energy, and homogeneity) of the images at the optimal wavelengths were extracted by the gray-level co-occurrence matrix. The results showed that both the spectral and image texture information could classify soil texture to some extent. The model established by the combination of optimal wavelengths and texture features achieved the highest correct classification rate of 87.9%. It was concluded that HSI was an efficient technique to classify the soil texture into four groups of clay, clay loam, loam, and sand. © 2019 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","data fusion; hyperspectral imaging; soil texture classification; texture features","Carbon capture; Classification (of information); Data fusion; Digital storage; Forestry; Hyperspectral imaging; Image classification; Infrared devices; Soil moisture; Spectroscopy; Textures; Carbon sequestration; Classification rates; Gray level co-occurrence matrix; Near-infrared hyperspectral imaging; Soil textures; Soil water retention; Texture features; Texture information; Image texture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077781199

Chen, Phys. Rev. B 98, 184404 (2018)2469-995010.1103/PhysRevB.98.184404], but its magnetic ground state remains ambiguous. Magnetometry measurements and time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction (NPD) have been employed to study the structural and magnetic properties of Co2V2O7, which includes two nonequivalent Co sites. Upon cooling below the Néel temperature TN=6.0(2) K, we observe magnetic Bragg peaks at 2 K in NPD, which indicates the formation of long-range magnetic order of Co2+ moments. After symmetry analysis and magnetic structure refinement, we demonstrate that Co2V2O7 possesses a complicated noncollinear magnetic ground state with Co moments mainly located in the b-c plane and forming a noncollinear spin-chain-like structure along the c-axis. The ab initio calculations demonstrate that the noncollinear magnetic structure is more stable than various ferromagnetic states at low temperature. The noncollinear magnetic structure with a canted ↑↑↓↓ spin configuration is considered to be the origin of magnetoelectric coupling in Co2V2O7 because the inequivalent exchange striction induced by the spin-exchange interaction between the neighboring spins could be the driving force of ferroelectricity. It is also found that the deviation of lattice parameters a and b is opposite below TN, while the lattice parameter c and β stay almost constant below TN, evidencing the anisotropic magnetoelastic coupling in Co2V2O7. © 2019 American Physical Society.",,"Anisotropy; Band structure; Calculations; Carbon dioxide; Cobalt; Ferroelectricity; Ground state; Lattice constants; Magnetic structure; Magnetism; Product development; Temperature; Long range magnetic order; Magnetoelastic couplings; Magnetoelectric couplings; Magnetometry measurements; Noncollinear magnetic structures; Spin-exchange interaction; Structural and magnetic properties; Time-of-flight neutron powder diffraction; Vanadium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073428782

Due to the small footprint of the flux chamber on the surface coverage, however, it is important to design a proper spatial deployment of the chambers with an optimal number of measurement points such that the measured fluxes are correctly scaled up to the whole landfill area. In order to improve the design of flux chamber network, several deterministic interpolation models were applied and results of reproducibility tests with 22 flux measurement data sets from ten municipal solid waste landfills in the Republic of Korea were compared one another. The bilinear model and natural neighbor model among the deterministic models showed stable results in all cases. The surface methane emissions estimated from arithmetic or geometric mean resulted in significant under- or overestimation compared to spatial interpolation methods in all data sets. As a result of this study, minimal number of flux measurement points could be determined for target error levels. Innovative flux chamber network design with proper measurement points will improve the accuracy of methane emission estimate from solid waste landfills. © 2019 The Authors","Deterministic models; Flux measurements; Landfill gas; Semi-variogram; Spatial interpolation; Surface methane emission","Interpolation; Methane; Municipal solid waste; Deterministic models; Flux measurements; Landfill gas; Methane emissions; Semivariograms; Spatial interpolation; Land fill; methane; emission; flux chamber; flux measurement; innovation; interpolation; landfill; methane; network design; solid waste; spatial data; variogram; arithmetic; Article; geometry; landfill; measurement accuracy; measurement error; municipal solid waste; priority journal; reliability; reproducibility; scale up; surface property; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067513443

Comparing the institutional variation of regional regimes, including their degrees of formalization, is gaining attention of studies on regionalism in International Relations. This study attempts to analyse the ways in which the selected cases of the forest-related Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and forest-focused Montréal Process (MP) regional regimes may have synergetic overlaps or disparity in their institutional design and forest policy development. For this, we combined IR's 'rational institutional design' theory and a policy analysis approach. Using a qualitative data approach, we analyzed key structure-related historical regime documents (e.g., charters) issued since the inception of both regimes, and their latest forest policy initiatives for the periods 2016-2025 (Strategic Plan of Action for ASEAN Cooperation on Forestry) and 2009-2015 (Conceptual Framework for the Montréal Process Strategic Action Plan) with all relevant policy documents since the adoption of current policies. Based on that, we pose the empirical questions of how both regimes illustrate governance structure (i.e., institutional design), and on the other hand how to explain regime forest policies coherently and consistently in terms of their high versus low degree of formality. The results show that institutional design is highly explanatory based on treaty and non-treaty regime formation as well as forest-related/focused regime formation with the synergistic sustainable forest management (SFM) issue that embraces deforestation and forest degradation, biodiversity, timber certification, and greenhouse gas emission. Additionally, the results suggest that the policy goals adopted by both regimes are coherent and consistent based on the full set of policy elements. Concerning the remedy for fragmented global forest governance arrangements, both regimes would be an example of practicing SFM-focused policies with the incorporation of forest-related policy elements into a larger governance assemblage dealing with issues such as biodiversity conservation or climate change mitigation. © 2019 by the authors.","Forest policy development; Formalization; Institutional design; Regional forest-related and forest-focused regimes","Biodiversity; Climate change; Conservation; Deforestation; Greenhouse gases; Timber; Association of Southeast Asian Nations; Biodiversity conservation; Climate change mitigation; Forest policy; Formalization; Institutional design; Regional forests; Sustainable forest management; Public policy; ASEAN; biodiversity; comparative study; deforestation; forest management; forestry policy; Montreal Protocol; policy development; timber certification; ASEAN; Biodiversity; Conservation; Deforestation; Greenhouse Gases; Sustainable Forest Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074342032

These results imply that there is tremendous opportunity for implementing CCS in large igneous provinces. However, the magnitude of this opportunity comprises commensurate levels of uncertainty because basalt reservoirs are characterized by highly heterogeneous, fracture-controlled hydraulic properties. This geologic uncertainty is propagated as parametric uncertainty in quantitative risk models, thus limiting the efficacy of models to predict CCS performance attributes, such as reservoir integrity and storage potential. To overcome these limitations, this study presents a stochastic approach for quantifying the geomechanical performance attributes of CCS operations in a highly heterogeneous basalt reservoir. We utilize geostatistical reservoir characterization to develop an ensemble of equally probable permeability distributions in a flood basalt reservoir with characteristics of the Wallula Basalt Pilot Project. We then simulate industrial-scale CO2 injections within the ensemble and calculate the mean and variance of fluid pressure over a 1-year injection period. These calculations are combined with the state of stress in southeast Washington State to constrain the spatial extent at which shear failure, fracture initiation, and borehole breakdown may occur. Results from this study show that (i) permeability uncertainty alone causes injection pressure to vary over 25 MPa, (ii) shear failure is likely to occur at 7 times greater distances from the injection than the CO2 migrates, and (iii) joint initiation pressures are localized within the volume comprising the CO2 plume. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","CO2 sequestration; Columbia River Basalt Group; heterogeneity; numerical modeling; permeability","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Floods; Geomechanics; Mechanical permeability; Numerical models; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Reservoirs (water); Risk assessment; Stochastic systems; Carbon capture and sequestrations; CO2 sequestration; Columbia river basalts; Geostatistical reservoirs; heterogeneity; Parametric uncertainties; Permeability distribution; Probabilistic assessments; Basalt; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; flood basalt; heterogeneity; numerical model; permeability; probability; reservoir characterization; uncertainty analysis; Columbia River; Iceland; United States; Washington [United States]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070756424

Due to the compact and large structures, AGS is characterised by the formation of zones with different dissolved oxygen (DO) and substrate gradients, which allows simultaneous nitrification and denitrification (SND). N2O emissions from AGS were investigated using laboratory-scale SBR fed with municipal wastewater. Special attention was paid to the effects of different organic loading rates (OLR) and aeration strategies. Emission factors (EF) were in a range of 0.54% to 4.8% (gN2O/gNH4-Nox.) under constant aerobic conditions during the aerated phase and different OLR. Higher OLR and SND were found to increase the N2O emissions. A comparative measurement of two similarly operated SBR with AGS showed that the reactor operated under constant aerobic conditions (DO of 2 mg L-1) emitted more N2O than the SBR with an alternating aeration strategy. Total nitrogen (TN) removal was significantly higher with the alternating aeration since non-aerated periods lead to increased anoxic zones inside the granules. The constant aerobic operation was found to promote the accumulation of NO2-N, which could explain the differences in the N2O levels. © 2019 The Authors","Aerobic granular sludge; N2O emission; Nitrogen removal; SBR","Dissolved oxygen; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Wastewater treatment; Aeration strategies; Aerobic condition; Aerobic granular sludges; Comparative measurements; Municipal wastewaters; Nitrous oxide emissions; Organic loading rates; Simultaneous nitrification and denitrification; Granular materials; dissolved oxygen; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; bioreactor; denitrification; dissolved oxygen; nitric oxide; nitrification; nitrogen; oxic conditions; pollutant removal; sludge; wastewater; wastewater treatment; aeration; aerobic granular sludge; Article; climate; comparative study; controlled study; denitrification; flocculent sludge; laboratory; municipal wastewater; nitrification; nitrous oxide emission; waste water management; bioreactor; sewage; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Nitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076949805

Producing one of the world's most astonishing cities is not the only concern for the government of the United Arab Emirates. The United Arab Emirates paid great attention to implementing various policies and strategies targeting to become among the most sustainable countries in the world. One of these strategies is the implementation of green roofs in residential and commercial spaces. Researches and studies indicate that green roofs are one of the strategies that result in an ecosystem when it is applied in urban regions. It can reduce the heat island effect that is formed in urban spaces which results in reducing air temperature and pollution in the environment, reducing greenhouse gas emission, energy conservation and many other benefits. This research proved the ability to mitigate heat island and improve thermal conditions when integrating these structures into the new developments and neighborhoods. This is achieved by examining the sequences resulting from integrating green roofs to the rooftops of residential units at Mina Al Arab compound by measuring the thermal parameters and investigating the changes that will occur using ENVI-met simulation program. The simulation compares a green roof system and a conventional roof system at 1:00 pm on a summer day and a winter day.

Understanding the regulatory mechanisms of ecosystem functions at local scales may facilitate predictions of the resistance and resilience of these functions to change. We evaluated how riverine bacterial community assembly and predicted gene content corresponded to decomposition rates of green leaf inputs from red alder trees into rivers of Washington State, USA. Previously, we documented accelerated decomposition rates for leaves originating from trees growing adjacent to the site of decomposition versus more distant locales, suggesting that microbes have a “home-field advantage” in decomposing local leaves. Here, we identified repeatable stages of bacterial succession, each defined by dominant taxa with predicted gene content associated with metabolic pathways relevant to the leaf characteristics and course of decomposition. “Home” leaves contained bacterial communities with distinct functional capacities to degrade aromatic compounds. Given known spatial variation of alder aromatics, this finding helps explain locally accelerated decomposition. Bacterial decomposer communities adjust to intraspecific variation in leaves at spatial scales of less than a kilometer, providing a mechanism for rapid response to changes in resources such as range shifts among plant genotypes. Such rapid responses among bacterial communities in turn may maintain high rates of carbon and nutrient cycling through aquatic ecosystems. © 2019 Jackrel et al.","Aquatic decomposition; Bacterial metabolism; Bacterial metabolism; Ecosystem subsidies; Environmental filtering; Intraspecific variation; Plant defensive chemistry","aromatic compound; alder; Article; bacterial metabolism; biodiversity; bioremediation; carbon cycling; community succession; controlled study; decomposition; degradation kinetics; environmental change; evolutionary rate; genotype; microbial community; microbiome; nonhuman; nutrient cycling; plant leaf; prediction; priority journal; adaptation; bacterium; ecosystem; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; plant leaf; tree; Washington; Adaptation, Physiological; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biodiversity; Ecosystem; Metabolic Networks and Pathways; Microbiota; Plant Leaves; Trees; Washington",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071743788

N2O mitigation strategies, in addition to reducing GHG emissions, ideally would not increase other harmful pollutants (such as leached nitrate, NO3, or volatilized ammonia, NH3) or decrease crop yield. We used the Denitrification-Decomposition model (DNDC) to simulate an array of single and combined interventions to corn management across broad range of physical conditions (climate and soil) in the Midwest US. We assumed a typical crop management baseline of continuous corn or corn-soy with conventional tillage and urea-ammonium nitrate fertilizer broadcast to the soil surface. Interventions included fertilizer nitrogen (N) form, controlled-release N, addition of nitrification inhibitors, N rate, split sidedress N applications, sub-soil N placement, and reduced tillage. Single-factor interventions which reduced N2O in all locales included a change to urea fertilizer, nitrification inhibitors, reductions to N rate, and use of N injection: urea fertilizer and nitrification inhibitors both reduced N2O emissions on average (30 and 9%, respectively) while simultaneously reducing NO3 leaching and mostly neutral effects to yield; N rate reductions reduced N2O (11%) but had modest negative effects to yield. Other single-factor interventions increase N2O emissions or N leaching on average but could have beneficial effects under some conditions. Combined interventions frequently include (&gt;50% of the time) urea, nitrification inhibitors, and reduced N. Interventions that, even when combined with other interventions, do not reduce N2O emissions and N leaching include anhydrous ammonia fertilizer, controlled release, and injection.

The Danish Eulerian Hemispheric Model (DEHM) has been used on a 50 km resolution over Europe in tagged mode in order to calculate the response of a 30% reduction of each emission sector in each Nordic country individually. The emission sectors considered in the study were energy production, non-industrial/commercial heating, industry, traffic, off-road mobile sources and waste management/agriculture. In total, 28 simulations were carried out. Following the air pollution modeling, the Economic Valuation of Air Pollution (EVA) model has been used to calculate the associated premature mortality and their costs. Results showed that more than 80 % of the PM2.5 concentration was attributed to transport from outside these four countries, implying an effort outside the Nordic region in order to decrease the pollutant levels over the area. The leading emission sector in each country was found to be non-industrial combustion (contributing by more than 60 % to the total PM2.5 mass coming from the country itself), except for Sweden, where industry contributed to PM2.5 with a comparable amount to non-industrial combustion. In addition to non-industrial combustion, the next most important source categories were industry, agriculture and traffic. The main chemical constituent of PM2.5 concentrations that comes from the country itself is calculated to be organic carbon in all countries, which suggested that non-industrial wood burning was the dominant national source of pollution in the Nordic countries. We have estimated the total number of premature mortality cases due to air pollution to be around 4000 in Denmark and Sweden and around 2000 in Finland and Norway. These premature mortality cases led to a total cost of EUR 7 billion in the selected Nordic countries. The assessment of the related premature mortality and associated cost estimates suggested that non-industrial combustion, together with industry and traffic, will be the main sectors to be targeted in emission mitigation strategies in the future. © 2019 Copernicus GmbH.

The methanotrophic community on duckweeds consisted primarily of γ-proteobacterial groups including the genera Methylomonas and Methylocaldum. Further analysis of co-cultures of a methanotroph isolate with sterilized duckweed revealed that the duckweed plant as well as the duckweed spent culture supernatant exerted an enhancing effect on methane oxidation.

This research focuses on the Punjab province of Pakistan and evaluates the impacts and consequences of climate change on general public at local and divisional level. In order to cope with the impacts of climatic changes at all levels, especially divisional level, raising reliable awareness and dispersing actionable knowledge regarding mitigating and adapting measures is significantly important. Therefore, recognition of information gaps, improvements in the level of alertness, and development of preventive measures in each sector is imperative. The impacts of climate change are observed across the country through gradual increase in temperature, human health issues, pest diseases, droughts, floods, and irregular weather patterns leading to changes in lifestyles, and these issues are likely to continue in the future. The main cause of climate change in Punjab, Pakistan, can be attributed to excessive release of greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere due to human activities involving inefficient energy usage, rapid urban expansion, improper waste management, industrial development, increasing transportation, agricultural activities, and livestock mismanagement. The findings of this study revealed that transportation sector is the major source of GHG emissions in the country, followed by industrialization and waste, at national, as well as divisional, level. The extent of impacts of climate change at divisional level is distinguishable and displayed a direct relationship with climate, geography, variation of effects, and modes of production in various regions of Punjab. The study strategically investigated all nine divisions of the province for comprehensive understanding of climate change phenomenon, and the results indicated that nearly three-fourths of the respondents have never indulged in taking steps towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. The study adopted a mixed (qualitative and quantitative) approach where the findings can act as set of guidelines for governmental authorities in formulating, assisting in preparation, instructing, and guiding policies for climate change mitigation and adaptation at national, local, and divisional levels.

However, this design can be found to be detrimental to airflow and it does not use air to improve air now. Therefore, we must consider the characteristics of the factory and the correct principle of fluid mechanics design. The air can flow through the green wall by inhalation to achieve the function of beautifying and purifying the air. And we will put active living wall module indoors, because many studies have shown that people spends to 80% to 90% of the time to stay indoor. Researchers believe that indoor air quality is closely related to people's health. It also meets WELL building standards. And there are also studies that indicate that plants in the classroom can increase the attention of school children. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to use fluid mechanics to design a new green wall for air purification and beautify the environment and promote air quality to create a better living environment. This study placed the active living wall module and the wooden core board together in a transparent acrylic box. After the veneer volatilizes volatile organic substances such as formaldehyde, the module is activated to cause the volatilized gas to pass through the pores below the leaves of the plant as the gas flows. It is also measured whether the concentration of the organic substance before and after passing is effectively changed after passing through the plant. At the same time, the relationship between the wind speed and the stomata of Baihejing is obtained experimentally, and the best photosynthesis efficiency can be obtained. This study found that the pumping mode removed 33% more formaldehyde than the non-exhausted mode. For this study, when 10.5 V (0.6 m/s) is given, there is an optimum photosynthesis efficiency between the wind speed and the planting pores, so the test will be tested at 0.6 m/s. We have found that active living wall module achieve increased efficiency in reducing pollutants. There is another experiment in this study to compare the active living wall modules with the commercially available air purifier. We evaluated the purification of formaldehyde and carbon dioxide, and the price and energy consumption etc. We found that this active living wall modules and commercial air purifier have the same ability of purification. However, there are still many issues in this research that have not been discussed in the future, so it will be more in-depth experiments and research, and also to develop a with the technology of low energy consumption, low pollution, low cost and good aesthetics, the active living wall module goal of reducing indoor air pollution is advanced. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Air; Air quality; Building codes; Carbon dioxide; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Fluid mechanics; Formaldehyde; Historic preservation; Indoor air pollution; Photosynthesis; Plants (botany); Ventilation; Ventilation codes; Walls (structural partitions); Wind; Active living walls; Building standards; Indoor air quality; Living environment; Low energy consumption; Organic substances; Pumping modes; Urban Heat Island Effects; Air cleaners",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074405024

Quantification of trans-boundary emissions is essential, especially for the construction sector, which requires great intermediate inputs from upstream sectors locally and globally. This study investigates the global energy-related CO2 emissions induced by Hong Kong's construction consumption based on multi-regional input-output analysis for the years 2004, 2007, and 2011. The results showed that the consumption-based CO2 emissions emitted to sustain the local construction consumption are at least 32.37% higher than those estimated by the conventional approach. The consumption-based CO2 has slightly declined from 2004 to 2011. This trend was closely tied to decreasing emission intensities of upstream sectors, even with strong growth in construction final demand. 96.61–97.41% of the consumption-based CO2 were indirect emissions, and 73.50–78.58% were trans-boundary emissions. Utilities, Manufacturing, and Transport &amp; Storage were the main source sectors contributing the most to total CO2 emissions. Based on the results, extended emission monitoring beyond municipal boundaries, diversification of import origins, implementation of import substitution, use of low carbon-intensive materials, and enhancement in electricity generation towards low-carbon fuels are proposed to mitigate construction-related CO2 emissions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions; Construction sector; Multi-regional input-output analysis; Urban area","Construction industry; International trade; CO2 emissions; Construction sectors; Conventional approach; Electricity generation; Input output analysis; Intermediate inputs; Municipal boundaries; Urban areas; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; construction industry; electricity generation; input-output analysis; urban area; Article; construction sector; construction work; consumer; controlled study; economic aspect; economic structure; electricity; Hong Kong; household; limit of quantitation; multi regional input output analysis; statistical analysis; trend study; urban area; China; Hong Kong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066272695

First, the aerodynamic characteristics of ionic wind were studied, and a maximum induced velocity of 3.3 m/s was achieved at an excitation voltage of 17 kV. Then, the optimal installation position of the actuator and the influence of the excitation voltage on flow control at different wind speeds were studied. The conclusions drawn are as follows. The effect of flow control is better when the upper electrode of the actuator is placed at the end of the top surface, increasing the likelihood of the plasma generation region approaching the natural separation location. The pressure on top of the slanted surface is primarily affected by airflow acceleration at a low excitation voltage and by the decrease of the separation zone at a high excitation voltage. The maximum drag reduction can be realized when the maximum velocity of ionic wind reaches 1.71 m/s at a wind speed of 10 m/s and 2.54 m/s at a wind speed of 15 m/s. Moreover, effective drag reduction can be achieved only by continuing to optimize the actuator to generate considerable thrust at a high wind speed. © 2019 by the authors.

Shenzhen, a fast-growing megacity in Southern China, has been one of the first practitioners to vigorously promote sustainable development in the building sector, for over 15 years. This study was therefore designed to employ the life cycle assessment approach to quantify the efforts of Shenzhen's public building practices, and evaluate its real ‘achievement’ by quantifying the CO2 emissions (CO2e) reduction over the past decades. The results show that the total CO2e from public buildings sectors in Shenzhen city have increased rapidly, from 15 Mt in 2005 to 22 Mt CO2e in 2016, because of the fast growth of public buildings’ construction activities. However, current ‘low-carbon’ efforts have only reduced CO2e by approximately 0.5 Mt annually over the past decade, and thus could not offset the rapid growth arising from the increase in floor area. This is hardly enough to contribute proportionally to the city's overall reduction target. In addition, we conducted a scenario analysis to determine the optimal mitigation measures. The results imply that accelerating the energy-saving renovation of existing buildings is a promising approach and could meet the pressing mitigation needs. These findings could not only inform evidence-based policies to promote the adoption of energy-saving building technologies in Shenzhen, but also shed light on sustainable transition in other megacities. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy-saving buildings; Life cycle assessment; Mitigation strategy; Shenzhen city","Carbon dioxide; Construction industry; Global warming; Intelligent buildings; Life cycle; Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy-saving buildings; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Mitigation strategy; Shenzhen city; Energy conservation; carbon dioxide; annual variation; building; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; energy use; life cycle analysis; megacity; mitigation; air pollution indicator; Article; building industry; carbon footprint; China; construction work; controlled study; country economic status; economic development; energy conservation; life cycle assessment; public policy; quantitative analysis; surface area; China; Guangdong; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067608143

Results show that CO2 emissions in Guangzhou will peak around 2023 under the current policy scenario. In order to advance the CO2 emissions peak to 2020, the more stringent emissions-reduction policies and measures need to be adopted under the peaking scenario and enhanced peaking scenario, with the peak emission value of 125–127 Mt CO2e.

Identifying remagnetization is difficult because it is commonly undetectable through the classic paleomagnetic field tests. Here we apply comprehensive paleomagnetic, rock magnetic, and petrographic studies to upper Triassic limestones in the eastern Qiangtang block. Our results reveal that detrital/biogenic magnetite, which may carry the primary natural remanent magnetization (NRM), is rarely preserved in these rocks. In contrast, authigenic magnetite and hematite pseudomorphs after pyrite, and monoclinic pyrrhotite record three episodes of remagnetization. The earliest remagnetization was induced by oxidation of early diagenetic pyrite to magnetite, probably related to the collision between the northeastern Tibetan Plateau and the Qiangtang block after closure of the Paleo-Tethys Ocean in the Late Triassic. The second remagnetization, residing in hematite and minor goethite, which is the further subsurface oxidation product of pyrite/magnetite, is possibly related to the development of the localized Cenozoic basins soon after India-Asia collision in the Paleocene. The youngest remagnetization is a combination of thermoviscous and chemical remanent magnetization carried by authigenic magnetite and pyrrhotite, respectively. Our analyses suggest that a high supply of organic carbon during carbonate deposition, prevailing sulfate reducing conditions during early diagenesis, and widespread orogenic fluid migration related to crustal shortening during later diagenesis, have altered the primary remanence of the shallow-water Tethyan carbonate rocks of the Tibetan Plateau. We emphasize that all paleomagnetic results from these rocks must be carefully examined for remagnetization before being used for paleogeographic reconstructions. Future paleomagnetic investigations of the carbonate rocks in orogenic belts should be accompanied by thorough rock magnetic and petrographic studies to determine the origin of the NRM. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","remagnetization; Tibetan Plateau; Triassic limestone","Carbonates; Hematite; Lime; Limestone; Lithology; Magnetite; Magnetization; Natural resources management; Organic carbon; Pyrites; Religious buildings; Sedimentology; Sulfur compounds; Chemical remanent magnetization; Natural remanent magnetization; Northeastern tibetan plateaux; Paleogeographic reconstruction; Remagnetization; Sulfate-reducing conditions; Tibetan Plateau; Triassic; Carbonation; carbonate rock; limestone; magnetic field; orogenic belt; paleomagnetism; petrography; remanent magnetization; rock property; Triassic; China; Qiangtang Block; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Xizang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069560706

However, it requires improvements of modelling methods, detailed observational data as input and expensive computational resources. This work aims to set up a distributed version of the HBV model with a physically based evapotranspiration scheme at 1 km resolution for mainland Norway and to calibrate/validate the model for 124 catchments using regionalized parameterizations. The Penman-Monteith equation was implemented in the HBV model and vegetation characteristics were derived from the Norwegian forest inventory combined with multi-source remote sensing data at 16 m spatial resolution. The estimated potential evapotranspiration (Ep) was compared with pan measurements and estimates from the MODerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MOD16) products, the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model (GLEAM) and Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) hydrological model. There are 5 climatic zones in Norway classified based on 4 temperature and precipitation indices. For each zone, the model was calibrated separately by optimizing a multi-objective function including the Nash-Sutcliff efficiency (NSE) and biases of selected catchments. In total, there are 85 catchments for calibration and 39 for validation. The Ep estimates showed good agreement with the measurements, GLEAM and VIC outputs. However, the MOD16 product significantly overestimates Ep compared to the other products. The discharge was well reproduced with the median daily NSE of 0.68/0.67, bias of −3%/−1%, Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) of 0.70/0.69 and monthly NSE of 0.80/0.78 in the calibration/validation periods. Our results showed a significant improvement compared to the previous HBV application for all catchments, with an increase of 0.08–0.16 in the median values of the daily NSE, KGE and monthly NSE. Both the temporal and spatial transferability of model parameterizations were also enhanced compared to the previous application. © 2019","HBV; High resolution; Norway; Potential evapotranspiration; Regional calibration","Calibration; Catchments; Efficiency; Image resolution; Remote sensing; Runoff; Spectrometers; Distributed hydrological modelling; High resolution; Moderate res-olution imaging spectrometers; Norway; Penman-Monteith equations; Potential evapotranspiration; Regional calibrations; Variable infiltration capacities; Evapotranspiration; calibration; catchment; evapotranspiration; forest inventory; hydrological modeling; Penman-Monteith equation; potential evapotranspiration; river discharge; satellite data; spatial distribution; spatial resolution; Norway; Hepatitis B virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069721253

However, the current sector policies focus either on the production side or consumption while the majority of sectors along the transmission were overlooked. This research combines input-output modelling and network analysis to track the embodied carbon emissions among thirty sectors of thirty provinces in China. Based on the large-data resolution network, a two-step network reduction algorithm is used to extract the backbone of the network. In addition, network centrality metrics and community detection algorithms are used to assess each individual sector's roles, and to reveal the carbon communities where sectors have intensive emission links. The research results suggest that the sectors with high out-degree, in-degree or betweenness can act as leverage points for carbon emissions mitigation. In addition to the electricity sector, which is included in the national ETS, the study also found that the metallurgy and construction sectors should be prioritized for emissions reduction from national and local levels. However, the hotpots are different across provinces and thus provincial specific targeted policies should be formed. Moreover, there are nineteen carbon communities in China with different features, which provides direction for provincial governments' external collaboration for synergistic effects. © 2019 by the authors.","Carbon emissions; China; Climate change; Input-output analysis; Network analysis; Policy","carbon emission; climate change; electricity industry; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; input-output analysis; network analysis; policy approach",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073630467

The wellbore failures lead to significant production of coal fines, reductions in well productivity, and downhole accidents. These negative outcomes make it essential to predict the conditions responsible for the failure of wellbores and to know when control measures are needed. This study proposed a semi-analytical model of coal wellbore stability during primary CBM recovery. The model incorporates the effects of sorption-induced strain, horizontal stress anisotropy, reservoir depletion, and well trajectory. Plane-strain poroelasticity and the Mogi–Coulomb failure criterion were applied to estimate critical drawdown and depletion for coal wellbore failure. A real field case from the San Juan Basin was simulated to validate the applicability of the proposed model. Wellbore failure-free operating envelopes were then generated for the life span of the field. The effects of sorption-induced strain and well trajectory on wellbore stability were analyzed, and the onset conditions for local wellbore failure and reservoir-scale coal failure were compared. Results revealed that the critical reservoir pressure (CRP_1) for local wellbore failure exceeded the pressure (CRP_2) for field-scale failure, i.e., local wellbore failure occurred earlier than reservoir failure. The CRP_1 value predicted using the model aligned well with actual field observations, thus verifying the model. The desorption-induced shrinkage effect inhibited wellbore failure when radial stress was the minimum principal stress; however, the shrinkage effect enhanced wellbore failure when radial stress was the intermediate principal stress. The optimal well trajectory for the San Juan Basin occurred at the inclination angle of approximately 20° and azimuth of 90°; and the CRP_1 had its minimum value at this trajectory. This study can help optimize field production plans, well trajectories, and well completion to mitigate coal wellbore instability. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.","Coalbed methane; Matrix shrinkage; Mogi–Coulomb criterion; Well trajectory; Wellbore stability","Boreholes; Coal; Coal bed methane; Coal deposits; Firedamp; Metal recovery; Methane; Natural gas wells; Oil field equipment; Production control; Shrinkage; Stability; Strain; Trajectories; Well completion; Coalbed methane recovery; Coulomb criterion; Coulomb failure criteria; Intermediate principal stress; Matrix shrinkage; Semi-analytical model; Well trajectory; Wellbore stability; Horizontal wells; azimuth; coalbed methane; drawdown; matrix; methane; poroelasticity; reservoir; trajectory; well completion; San Juan Basin [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065227741

This study focused on the effects of primary NOX control methods (different loads, over fire air, the ratios of secondary air and over fire air) and secondary NOX control methods (selective non-catalytic reduction process) on NOX emission and combustion characteristic. Results showed that the moisture evaporation rate, volatile release rate, char burning rate, temperature and the strength of flow velocity decreased as decreasing the operating load. However, the NOX emission of furnace outlet increased from 273.18 mg/Nm3 to 602.10 mg/Nm3. 100% operating load was the best condition to obtain a lowest NOX emission and a best combustion characteristic among different loads. In addition, the combustion strategy combining secondary air and over fire air could improve the combustion performance and reduce NOX emission. Further, a higher over fire air ratio was conducive to the formation of strong swirl flow and the enhancement of flow velocity strength in the flue. The optimal over fire air ratio was 31%–35% with NOX emission of 267.05 mg/Nm3 to 273.18 mg/Nm3 and residence time of 2.75 s–3.03 s. Moreover, ammonia based selective non-catalytic reduction process, better than urea, achieved a NOX emission of 132.41 mg/Nm3, a NOX removal efficiency of 51.50% and NH3 slip of 11.08 mg/Nm3 or 6.71 ppm. The study indicated that the optimal NOX control method was a condition of 100% load, combining with over fire air and 31% and 35% over fire air ratio.

Mass production through the use of machines has improved the overall societal prosperity in industrialized countries. The great and continuous demand of mechanization, economic growth, and energy consumption has resulted in the excessive use of natural resources and the mining of natural energy deposits. Challenges such as serious environmental pollution, ecological damage, and climate change have been identified as some of the critical issues for sustainable development. Therefore, this paper proposes a Delphi and Fuzzy (DFuzzy) model in order to institute low-carbon ecocities. DFuzzy is a scientific decision-making model with quantitative multiple attributes and artificial intelligence. Twelve specialists from the Delphi experts were interviewed, including chief executive officers (CEOs) of industries, management committee members, and senior academics, all of whom have 15 years of experience in urban planning practice. After a three-round Delphi process with 17 criteria that were taken from the literature, four criteria of the DFuzzy model were recognized by experts: policy norms, resident cooperation, pollution prevention and control, and ecological reserves. The practical application of the DFuzzy model took three areas as examples: the Baiyun District and Conghua District of Guangzhou City, and the Dahu Community of Kaohsiung City. Through the experts' consensus in the two-round Delphi process, the four criteria, as the input basis, demonstrated the objective quantitative calculation function of the DFuzzy model and also indicated that the model established in this study provides a reference for evaluating low-carbon ecocities. © 2019 by the authors.","Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Decision support; Delphi method; Environmental pollution; Fuzzy logic theory; Industrial revolution; Sustainable development","climate change; conceptual framework; Delphi analysis; economic growth; energy balance; fuzzy mathematics; manufacturing; quantitative analysis; questionnaire survey; urban planning; China; Conghua; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Kaohsiung; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074246020

The study sites included the Challenger Knoll, which was drilled by the Deep Sea Drilling Program (DSDP) in 1969 and showed the influence of salt tectonics on its evolution and the presence of subsurface petroleum. This study used gas flare mapping in the water column, detailed seafloor bathymetry, backscatter mapping, sub-bottom profiling, and remote sensing of surface water to locate seafloor areas of hydrocarbon emissions. Flares of gas bubbles were detected in the water column above all three knolls, making them the deepest reported gas emission sites in the GOM. Although surface oil slicks above the Sigsbee Knolls have been detected by satellite imaging in the past; in this study, neither satellite imagery nor ship-based observations detected floating oil, this suggests that oil seepage in the region is intermittent. High-resolution video surveys of the seafloor at Challenger Knoll, using a camera system mounted on a lowered tow-vehicle, documented the presence of seep-related chemosynthetic fauna including clam fields and microbial mats at the western part of the knoll. These findings are consistent with previous investigations that link hydrocarbon seepage at Challenger Knoll to salt tectonics. During visual seafloor inspections, no asphalt deposits, such as those known from sites in the Campeche Knoll area in the southern GOM, were observed. These findings indicate that hydrocarbon seepage is less pronounced in the Sigsbee Knolls region, central GOM, than is the case in hydrocarbon systems in the northern or southern GOM. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Flares; Gas emissions; Hydroacoustic; Hydrocarbons; Natural oil slicks; Remote sensing; Sigsbee Knolls","Deepwater drilling; Gas emissions; Hydrocarbons; Infill drilling; Mapping; Remote sensing; Salt tectonics; Satellite imagery; Surface waters; Underwater acoustics; Flares; Hydrocarbon emission; Hydrocarbon systems; Oil slicks; Satellite imaging; Seafloor bathymetry; Sigsbee Knolls; Surface oil slick; Hydrocarbon seepage; asphalt; carbon emission; Deep Sea Drilling Project; hydrocarbon seep; remote sensing; salt tectonics; seafloor; seepage; tectonic evolution; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Bivalvia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074514147

Over the years, the areas studied included several 'environmental hotspots', one of which was a hazardous industrial enterprise - the Kardzhali lead-zinc smelter. It was known to be the main source of lead, cadmium, zinc, and sulfur oxide contamination in the country. An overview of the available data from all moss surveys was made to reveal temporal and spatial deposition trends for the investigated metals and metalloids during the 20-year period of participation. Throughout the surveys, three analytical techniques were used: neutron activation analysis, atomic absorption spectrometry, and atomic emission spectrometry with inductively coupled plasma. Up to 47 elements were determined in 2005/6, 2010/11 and in 2015/16 (Ag, Al, As, Au, Ba, Br, Ca, Cd, Ce, Cl, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Dy, Fe, Hf, Hg, I, In, K, La, Li, Mg, Mn, Mo, Na, Nd, Ni, P, Pb, Rb, Sb, Sc, Se, Sm, Sr, Ta, Tb, Th, Ti, Tm, U, V, W, Yb, and Zn). The results were anticipated to be an extension to the available data on a small number of elements investigated by the State regulatory bodies and those reported to the ICP Vegetation programme. Due to violation of state environmental policy, a temporary shutting down of the production processes took place during the 2010/11 moss survey. It follows that biomonitoring took place around the time when the deposition rates were the highest, and then continued through 2015/16, while there was no industrial output. The smelter in Kardzhali is going to be reinstated in the near future after a major renovation. The moss survey data could be used to assess the new pollution-control equipment efficacy, and for estimation of health and environmental risks, and aid risk-management decisions. © 2019 Author(s).",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074145583

It is increasingly clear that farmers can detect the regional biophysical expressions and impacts of climate change. However, this has not led farmers to desire to take action on climate change. This begs the question: how then are farmers interpreting these experiences? We argue that political-economic context, the structural conditions of capitalist production, contributes to how farmers perceive and understand the impacts of climate change. We draw from our novel political economy of relevance theoretical framework and apply this framework to a sample of over 100 qualitative interviews with Iowa and Indiana row-crop farmers. We focus on their experiences with heavy rain events, a key impact of climate change in the Midwest. Our findings suggest that farmers become aware of, interpret and respond to heavy rain events within the context of capitalist production.

Catalyst preparation by colloidal synthesis often makes use of surfactants (capping agents) that control the size and morphology of target nano-objects during and after their synthesis. However, this approach can severely compromise the catalytic properties of the as-synthesized nanomaterials. Photonic curing is suitable to gently remove surfactants from the catalyst surface without severely altering its overall structural properties (e.g., surface faceting), thereby increasing the abundance of these surface active sites that can participate in the desired (electro)catalytic reaction. This catalyst activation is exemplarily demonstrated on the basis of Cu nanowire (Cu-NW) catalysts synthesized by an oleylamine route and transferred to a glassy carbon (GC) support electrode. Although the 3D networks of the as-synthesized Cu-NW catalysts predominantly produce hydrogen as the product of the electrolysis reaction, photonically cured Cu-NWs, denoted hereinafter as Cu metal membrane catalysts (MMCs), show a high selectivity toward ethylene formation, reaching a Faradaic efficiency of FEC2H4 = 42.4% (JC2H4 = -7.8 mA cm-2, E = -1.1 V vs RHE). This high ethylene yield can even be maintained during prolonged electrolysis of 110 h. A further beneficial effect of the photonic curing treatment is related to the substantially increased mechanical stabilization of the Cu-NW film on the support electrode induced by a ""mild"" sintering of Cu-NWs, which remains locally confined to their points of contact. A loss of catalyst material or a delamination of the catalyst film from the support electrode during massive gas evolution can thus be prevented.

The MODIS-derived aerosol optical depth (AOD) data was used as an auxiliary data to supplement the analysis with surface measured PM2.5. The emission source inventory and meteorology datasets are also used and analyzed to examine the causes of changes in trends of PM2.5. The results revealed that the annually averaged values of AOD and surface PM2.5 concentrations over the high-polluted areas are decreasing year-by-year, with stable values found over the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region. The decreasing trends of PM2.5 concentration and fine particle pollution frequency over the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei (BTH) area are most obvious. Over the PRD region, PM2.5 concentration maintains below the annual air quality standard (35 μg/m3) with low fine particle pollution frequency. The decreasing trend of averaged PM2.5 in each region is closely related to the reduction of anthropogenic PM2.5 emissions. However, the fluctuated features in different season are mostly influenced by the meteorological conditions. Based on the weather type classifications observed from the COST733 model, the weather types under uniform pressure and eastern high pressure more likely resulted in the occurrence of fine particulate pollution over China. When the weather under the bottom with high pressure occurs, Northeast China (NEC) and BTH regions are most likely to be polluted, which is more likely to lead to heavy fine particle pollution events. The air pollution in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) area is the most serious when the uniform pressure field weather occurs in winter. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic emissions; Fine particulate matter; Meteorological conditions; Spatiotemporal evolution","Air quality; Meteorology; Particles (particulate matter); Aerosol optical depths; Anthropogenic emissions; Fine particulate matter; Fine particulate matter (PM2.5); Interannual variability; Meteorological condition; Spatiotemporal evolution; Yangtze river delta; River pollution; aerosol; air quality; annual variation; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; climate conditions; concentration (composition); high pressure; meteorology; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; aerosol; air pollution; air quality standard; article; China; environmental protection; meteorology; optical depth; particulate matter; river; weather; winter; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069560162

The combination of the MCFC, CHP and MSP can be considered as an innovative breakthrough in the field of energy systems, in light of the fact that the reforming compartment can mutually feed both MCFC and MSP, and the whole process can simultaneously produce electricity, pure methanol and hot water. The SMR at 800 kPa and 600 °C was applied to produce synthetic gas required by MCFC and MSP. The simulation was performed by Aspen Hysys, considering several operational conditions and the best was selected according to exergetic performance assessment. The structure produced 110,544 kW net electricity (34% MCFC, 33.4% gas turbine, 18.4% RC and 14.2% ORC), pure methanol (99.9%) at 271.7 kgmole/h, and hot water at 80 °C and 65398.7 kgmole/h.

Since electrostatic force has the tendency to tug down the water, thus, a static electricity force creating plastic tank has been proposed to install at the bottom of plants to capture the transpiration water vapor and treated it in site by applying UV technology to meet the domestic water demand. A given amount of collected water (H2O) is also be decomposed into oxygen (O2) and energy state hydrogen gas (H2) by implementing electrolysis (Anode-oxidation: 2H2O(l) → O2(g) + 4H+(aq) + 4e− Eo = +1.23 V; Cathode-reduction 2H+(aq) + 2e− → H2(g) Eo = 0.00 V) to produce clean energy. Since the standard potential of the water electrolysis cell (Eo cell = Eo cathode − Eo anode) is − 1.23 V at 25 °C at pH 0 ([H+] = 1.0 M) at 25 °C with pH 7 ([H+] = 1.0 × 10−7 M), thus, the thermodynamic standard of cell potential can be obtained from standard-state free energy calculations by using the equation: ΔG° = −nFE° (where E° is the cell potential) to collect the activated hydrogen energy for domestic use to meet the energy demand.

Yet, translating climate science into management actions and policies is an ongoing challenge. In particular, four aspects have confounded implementation of climate-resilient management: (i) regional management tools may not be well-suited for managing the same systems under climate change, (ii) individual management policies and climate research studies are often implicitly focussed on spatio-temporal scales that are rarely aligned, (iii) management approaches seldom integrate across spatio-temporal scales and are, therefore, maladapted to unidirectional change and extreme events, and (iv) challenges to modelling socio-economic implications of climate change impede projections of cumulative costs to society, disguise adaptive limits, and ultimately impact climate risk and management trade-off assessments. We suggest that addressing environmental change favours adaptive and dynamic management approaches, while addressing shifting socio-economic and political conditions favours fixed long-term measures; considering both jointly requires a combination of dynamic-adaptive-fixed approaches. We outline a framework to integrate climate-responsive tools into a unified climate-resilient management approach using nested dynamic-adaptive-fixed management portfolios that improve management effectiveness and efficiency. This approach may help reduce future conflict between marine resource extractive and conservation goals through more explicit characterization of management trade-offs and identification of social and ecological tipping points. © 2019 Published by International Council for the Exploration of the Sea 2019.

However, few studies have examined both the long-term effects of climate (temperature, precipitation and wind disturbance) and non-climate (stand structure and topography) factors. In this study, we analyzed forest census data from 15 forest plots (17.5 ha, 8460 trees) in two primeval reserve areas over a 38-year period (1979–2016) using individual-based or grid-based state-space models to evaluate the effects of climate and non-climate factors that affect the demographic parameters (growth rate, mortality, and recruitment rate) of the three coniferous and seven deciduous broad-leaved species. Two climate factors during the growth period differentially affected the growth rate of trees: high temperature and high precipitation had negative effects on coniferous species and positive effects on broad-leaved species, respectively. The change of stand basal area and its interaction between precipitation in non-growth period affected the growth rate of some species. Furthermore, the mortality of large conifers was strongly affected by a typhoon in 2004. The dominance of coniferous species has declined especially in plots with west-facing slopes and from snowfall that has largely diminished since 1979. In northern Japan, the temperature and precipitation of the growth period are increasing, and snowfall is decreasing. Our results indicated that this climate change reduced the growth rates of coniferous species and increased those of broad-leaved species. Moreover, wind disturbances will increase, which will accelerate the change in species composition by removing dominant coniferous trees. This study is the first to show these directional changes in the species composition of northern mixed forests from conifer-dominated to broad-leaved tree-dominated based on the long-term tree demography. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Bayesian state-space model; Competition; Deciduous broad-leaved trees; Evergreen conifers; Growth; Mortality; Snowfall; Wind disturbance","Climate models; Competition; Forestry; Growth (materials); Population dynamics; Population statistics; Snow; State space methods; Topography; Broadleaved trees; Evergreen conifers; Mortality; State - space models; Wind disturbance; Climate change; basal area; climate change; community composition; competition (ecology); coniferous tree; deciduous forest; deciduous tree; ecological modeling; forest dynamics; growth rate; high temperature; mixed forest; mortality; precipitation (climatology); typhoon; wind; Competition; Forestry; Forests; Growth Rate; Mortality; Precipitation; Snow; Topography; Coniferales; Coniferophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069678298

This article focuses on an understudied set of governance scripts: development strategies that stem from international organizations and shape foreign aid. I argue that global norms of energy development push increased fossil fuel consumption as a means of development. It is widely known, however, that international environmental organizations diffuse norms that push nations to protect the environment. These contradictory scripts call into question the uniformly beneficial impact of the world polity on the natural environment. This study examines energy aid's impact on national carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in developing nations in the context of these contradictory norms. Using an original panel dataset of 121 countries, I test three hypotheses using fixed-effects regression with AR[1] corrections: (1) Whether aid increases CO2 emissions in recipient countries, (2) whether nations more embedded in the world environmental regime emit less carbon dioxide, and (3) whether the impact of energy sector aid is moderated by world environmental regime integration. Findings show that aid is associated with increased CO2 emissions, but environmental regime embeddedness moderates this effect.

The SEI provides a passivation layer on the anode surface, which inhibits further electrolyte decomposition and affords the long calendar life required for many applications. However, the SEI remains poorly understood. Recent investigations of the structure of the initial SEI, along with changes which occur to the SEI upon aging, have been conducted. The investigations provide significant new insight into the structure and evolution of the anode SEI. The initial reduction products of ethylene carbonate (EC) are lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LEDC) and ethylene. However, the instability of LEDC generates an intricate mixture of compounds, which greatly complicates the composition of the SEI. Mechanisms for the generation of the complicated mixture of products are presented along with the differences in the SEI structure in the presence of electrolyte additives. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.The development of lithium-ion batteries has afforded rapid advances in portable electronic devices and is enabling the implementation of electric vehicles. However, the low reduction potential of the graphitic anode requires the generation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to passivate the electrode surface and enable long-term cycling. While the SEI has been under investigation for a few decades, a thorough understanding of the formation and evolution mechanisms of the SEI has remained elusive. SEI component instability leads to decomposition of the SEI, generating gases and electrolyte soluble species. The evolution results in increased porosity of the SEI, further electrolyte reduction, and SEI thickening. Recent results suggest that the design of more stable SEI components would lead to improved performance. We also suggest that a better understanding of the nano-structure of the SEI components and ion transport along particle grain boundaries is critical for further advances. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.The development of lithium-ion batteries has afforded rapid advances in portable electronic devices and is enabling the implementation of electric vehicles. The low reduction potential of the graphitic anode requires the generation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to passivate the surface and enable long-term cycling, but resistance of the SEI significantly limits high rate charging. This perspective reviews the formation and decomposition reactions of the SEI and proposes a new mechanism for SEI thickening. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","aging mechanism; electrolyte; lithium ion battery; solid electrolyte interphase","Additives; Anodes; Charging (batteries); Electric automobiles; Electrolytes; Ethylene; Grain boundaries; Ions; Lithium compounds; Mixtures; Nanostructures; Passivation; Portable equipment; Seebeck effect; Solid electrolytes; Solid-State Batteries; Thermoelectric equipment; Aging mechanism; Decomposition reaction; Electrolyte decomposition; Electrolyte reduction; Formation and evolutions; Lithium ethylene dicarbonate; Portable electronic devices; Solid electrolyte interphase; Lithium-ion batteries; aging; electrolyte; ethylene; ion; lithium",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073100327

It is reasonable to think that the actions of the EU and the US, as powerful entities in global politics, influence the contours and effectiveness of the international climate change regime. The EU has for a long time strived to play the strongest role possible in international climate negotiations and to maximise its climate change targets, which is reflected through its climate policies and legal implementation of the international climate change regime. The situation in the US is more polarised, with the Republican Party almost uniformly denying the existence of climate change and any human impact on rising global temperatures. Instead of taking scientific reports on impacts, risks and adaptation to climate change seriously, the Trump administration is focused on increasing US production of oil, natural gas and coal. Meanwhile, Democrats are pushing to combat climate change, build a clean energy economy and secure environmental justice. This article explores and explains the legal differences in the EU and the US responses to climate change and climate change targets, and considers the possible contributing factors. The assessment takes account of policies at the highest governing level, thus not taking account of what is happening among some US states. © 2019, © 2019 International Bar Association.","climate change targets; climate science; EU climate policy; precautionary principle; principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and capabilities; public awareness; temperature goal; U.S. climate policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075054218

O. Kuntze) plantation in Jiangsu Province, China, including the following treatments: no nitrogen (N) fertilizer (control), conventional mineral N fertilizer (urea) (CN), soybean cake fertilizer (SF), pig manure (PM), cattle manure (CaM), chicken manure (CM), and CM + biochar (CMB). Cumulative nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitric oxide (NO) emissions were 4.8 ± 0.1 and 3.7 ± 0.3 kg N ha−1 year−1 under CN, respectively, and increased to 5.4 ± 0.2 and 4.6 ± 0.3 kg N ha−1 year−1 under SF (P ' 0.05), respectively. Treatments with livestock manures (PM, CaM, and CM) reduced N2O (41.4–49.6%) and NO (46.5–59.8%) emission in comparison to CN. Combined amendment of CM and biochar more effectively reduced N2O emissions than CM treatment alone. Based on a meta-analysis of 26 global paired measurements in acid soils, the threshold of C/N ratios of organic fertilizers between the positive and negative responses of N2O emissions to organic fertilizers was 8.6 with a range of 4.5–22.3 (95% confidence interval), indicating that reduced N2O emission under PM, CaM and CM was potentially due to their C/N ratios compared to the threshold. Organic fertilizer application did not influence tea yield, while combined application of CM and biochar increased tea yield and resulted in the least yield-scaled N2O emission. N2O and NO emission factors for N fertilizers applied under CN were 1.9 ± 0.1% and 1.5 ± 0.2%, respectively, and reduced to 0.08 ± 0.04% and 0.12 ± 0.04% under CMB, respectively. The results suggest that tea plantations in the subtropical region are hotspots for N2O and NO emissions.

A basic hierarchical graph model consists of two local graph models with three decision makers: one common decision maker supervising both local graph models, and two local decision makers, each of whom takes part in one local graph model. Two types of coalition, between the common and one local decision maker, and between two local decision makers are discussed. Theorems are proposed, indicating that transition from one equilibrium to another, called equilibrium jump, can only take place in the coalition consisting of common and local decision maker. The change to a more preferred equilibrium for local decision makers could only take place when they temporarily sacrifice their interests. An illustrative example of hierarchical disputes over achieving emission goals between the national and two provincial governments in China are investigated. The results suggest that agreements between the national and one provincial government can be reached. The province will achieve stricter emission goals when being subsidized by the national government. Agreements between the two provinces cannot be formed without the participation of the national government.

Although coastal zones have been affected by local human activities for centuries, how local human impacts and climate change stressors may interact to jeopardize coastal ecosystems remains poorly understood. Here we provide a review on interactions between climate change and local human impacts (e.g., interactions between sea level rise and anthropogenic land subsidence, which are forcing Indonesia to relocate its capital city) in the coastal realm. We highlight how these interactions can impair and, at times, decimate a variety of coastal ecosystems, and examine how understanding and incorporating these interactions can reshape theory on climate change impacts and ecological resilience. We further discuss implications of interactions between climate change and local human impacts for coastal conservation and elucidate the context when and where local conservation is more likely to buffer the impacts of climate change, attempting to help reconcile the growing debate about whether to shift much of the investment in local conservation to global CO2 emission reductions.

Gamma rays with energy from 250 MeV to 100 GeV are fitted with the NH model as a function of t353, NH μ t1353a (a≥1.0), to explicitly take into account a possible nonlinear t353/NH ratio. We found that a nonlinear relation, a 1.4, gives the best fit to the γ-ray data. This nonlinear relation may indicate dust evolution effects across the different gas phases. Using the best-fit NH model, we derived the CO-to-H2 conversion factor (XCO) and gas mass, taking into account the uncertainties of the NH model. The value of XCO is found to be (0.63-0.76)× 1020 cm-2 K-1km-1s, which is consistent with that of a recent γ-ray study of the Chamaeleon region. The total gas mass is estimated to be (6.0-7.3)×104 M, of which the mass of additional gas not traced by standard H I or CO line surveys is 20%-40%. The additional gas amounts to 30%-60% of the gas mass estimated in the case of optically thin H I and has five to seven times greater mass than the molecular gas traced by CO. Possible origins of the additional gas are discussed based on scenarios of optically thick H I and CO-dark H2.

Risk communication and health messaging about recommended behaviors to reduce exposure to air pollution can be integrated into existing care routines and structures. How this can be achieved most appropriately and effectively is not well understood. A focus group design is used to investigate cardiovascular patient and provider experiences, attitudes and beliefs about the risks of air pollution, related health risk messaging and factors that may influence integrating that topic into patient care and communication. Three discussions were hosted, one with cardiac patients, a second with non-physician cardiac rehabilitation providers and a third with physicians who treat cardiac patients. A within-case thematic inductive analysis of each discussion is used to understand the nature of communication, logistics, guidance and overall substance of the cardiac rehabilitation educational experience. Results suggest that air pollution may be an unrecognized risk factor for cardiac patients and cardiac rehabilitation is a prime setting for communicating air pollution health risk messaging. However, to effectively integrate air quality health risk messaging into cardiac rehabilitation, it is critical to account for the existing knowledge-base and behaviors of both providers and patients. © 2019 by the authors.

The main component of the conventional domestic heating equipment is a hot water boiler, powered by a burner. Generally, the present analysis is divided into two parts. The first part is based on analyzing the system for 12 daylight hours in which solar radiation is available, while the second part evaluates it for 12 night hours. To provide the heating load of the building during daylight hours, the solar-based system is used, and the conventional equipment is utilized at night hours. The real heating load of the building constituted of the total load relevant to hot consumed water and the building thermal loss rate in cold months and the available solar radiation are calculated and employed in the simulations. Also, the monthly average total solar radiation, applied in the simulations, is between 7.63 MJ/m2/day and 25.39 MJ/m2/day throughout a year. The results revealed that the highest heating load for air conditioning purposes in warm and cold days are 37.52 kW and 91.05 kW, respectively. Furthermore, the highest heating load is provided using 63.3 m2 and 443.8 m2 of FPSCs for hot and cold air conditioning, correspondingly. Besides, the maximum payback period of coupling the FPSCs with the conventional equipment is found to be 3.1 years. Also, the employment of FPSCs contributes to reductions in CO2 emission rate with values of 84.67 kg/MWh and 84.71 kg/MWh for cold and warm days, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Case study; Conventional equipment; Economic; Environmental; Flat plate solar collector; Residential building","Air conditioning; Economic analysis; Economics; Heating equipment; Housing; Investments; Solar buildings; Solar collectors; Solar radiation; Conventional equipment; Conventional heating; Environmental; Environmental aspects; Environmental assessment; Flat-plate solar collectors; Hot water boilers; Residential building; Heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071229239

Firstly, prelocalized coordinates configuration will be done to determine the places of vehicle parking lots. Secondly, an adaptive weather analytic technique that depended on first statistics (i.e., the mean & variance) criteria was adopted in this work to measure and compensate the weather condition changes using information of RGB chromatic channels. Finally, parking spaces inspection technique is used that based on some pixels of empty road and parking areas to detect and classify vehicle occupancy in these lots.

Wind energy integration is increasing in worldwide each year. To efficiently investigate a quality voltage for AC loads under wind speed variations, a combined control strategy is proposed in this paper. It consists of PI and model predictive control (MPC) for the three-phase rectifier and interlinking inverter, respectively. The controlled rectifier ensures a constant DC-bus voltage under variable wind speed, while MPC is used to control output AC load voltage under abrupt load changes. Unlike traditional controllers, MPC does not require PI controllers for inner current and outer voltage loop or complex modulation steps. The discrete state-space model of VSI, LC filter, and load currents are used to predict future trends of load voltage for each of eight switching states. The control strategy selects the optimal switching state that reduces the error difference between reference and predicted load voltage. The proposed scheme is tested under perturbation of generation and load parameters. The proposed MPC strategy is compared with the conventional method-based PI controllers. The presented results ensure the effectiveness of the proposed approach with 0.67% THD for the AC output voltage. © 2019 IEEE.","Controlled rectifier; model predictive control; standalone renewable energy system; voltage source inverter; wind generating systems","Controllers; Electric power system protection; Microgrids; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Rectifying circuits; State space methods; Wind; Wind power; Combined control strategies; Controlled rectifier; Conventional methods; Discrete state space; Renewable energies; Three-phase rectifiers; Wind energy integration; Wind speed variations; Electric rectifiers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113898033

On a COD basis, the amount of methanol generated could denitrify nearly 7 mg L−1 of NO3-N. © 2019","Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria; Anaerobic digestion; Bioengineered system; Circular economy; DAMO; Dissolved methane","Ammonia; Bacteria; Batch reactors; Chemical oxygen demand; Denitrification; Dissolution; Methane; Methanol; Natural resources management; Resource allocation; Ammonia oxidizing bacteria; Bioengineered system; Circular economy; DAMO; Dissolved methane; Anaerobic digestion; biofuel; methane; methanol; anaerobic digestion; bacterium; bioengineering; chemical oxygen demand; dissolved gas; economic conditions; effluent; immobilization; methane; methanotrophy; oxidation; resource management; alcohol production; ammonia oxidizing bacterium; anaerobic digestion; Article; controlled study; denitrifying methane oxidizing organism; effluent; gas; hydraulic retention time; methanotroph; methanotrophic bacterium; Methylococcus capsulatus; nonhuman; organisms by metabolism; oxidation; priority journal; recycling; resource management; thermal conductivity; waste water management; anaerobic growth; bioreactor; denitrification; oxidation reduction reaction; Methylococcus capsulatus; Nitrosomonadales; Anaerobiosis; Bioreactors; Denitrification; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067202653

Alberta's Oil Sands industry, arguably one of Canada's largest and most energy intensive industries, has made significant progress towards improving energy efficiency and reducing its fossil energy footprint, including investigating options for integrating bio-based feedstocks into bitumen extraction and processing. Nevertheless, developing sustainable bioenergy supply chains remains a crucial challenge to reaching this goal. This paper investigates pathways for harvesting and hauling biomass residues to produce bio-oil that can replace fossil fuels used in oil sands bitumen processing. A 3–stage grid model is developed, comprising a square grid distribution of harvesting fields and district centres. Biomass is collected and hauled to fast pyrolysis units centrally located within square harvesting fields. Raw bio-oil is hauled from fields to the centre of one of 11 District centres, where it is stabilized and blended. Stage–1 and Stage–2 estimate hauling distance using hypothetical roads described by geometric equations and tortuosity factors. Stage–3 hauling of stabilized bio-oil from District centres to upgraders at Scotford AB and Fort McMurray AB is estimated by using web-based mapping tools and actual road networks. Total diesel requirements for hauling are calculated using total distances obtained from the 3–stage hauling model. Average diesel consumption obtained from the model is 0.32 L per 1000 L of bio-oil produced, increasing to 3.45 L per 1000 L bio-oil delivered to district centres. Total diesel consumption is 10.23 and 14.40 L per 1000 L bio-oil delivered to Scotford and Ft. McMurray, respectively. The model shows that co-processing of biomass residues can reduce the fossil energy footprint of processing oil sands synthetic crude oil by 22–28%. The quantity of delivered bio-oil is sufficient to replace petroleum coke and synthetic crude oil used for combustion as well as a substantial fraction of natural gas fuel. Moreover, the model can help to determine the most suitable processing and hauling options at each stage in order to minimize diesel fuel requirements, and the model framework can be extended to other jurisdictions as well as other industries. © 2019","Bio-oil; Biomass hauling; Coutilization; Oil sands; Pyrolysis; Renewable energy","Biomass; Bituminous materials; Crude oil; Diesel engines; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Harvesting; Natural gas wells; Oil sands; Petroleum coke; Pyrolysis; Sand; Supply chains; Synthetic fuels; Bio oil; Bio-based feedstock; Bioenergy supplies; Co-utilization; Energy intensive industries; Geometric equations; Renewable energies; Synthetic crude oil; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068127520

The main advantage of using a supply function is that energy efficiency adoption can change as demand changes. Models such as Duke University’s Dynamic Integrated Economy/Energy/Emissions Model (DIEM) have had to rely on simplistic or fixed estimates of future energy efficiency from the literature rather than on estimates from energy efficiency supply curves. This paper attempts to develop a realistic energy efficiency supply curve and to improve on the current energy efficiency modeling. It suggests an alternative approach based on saved-energy cost data from program administrators and explains the methodologies employed to create the supply curve. It illustrates this approach with results from DIEM for various electricity demand scenarios. The analysis suggests that an additional 5–9% of energy efficiency is deployed for every 10% increase in the cost of electricity. Therefore, DIEM “invested” in energy efficiency up to an inelastic point on the energy efficiency supply curve. By contrast, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s energy efficiency approach assumes that realized energy efficiency is fixed, and has no elasticity, regardless of changes to marginal costs or constraints that affect emissions or economics. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Cost of saved energy; Electricity and integrated resource planning; Energy efficiency potential; Supply curve, supply function; Utility economics","Cost benefit analysis; Costs; Economics; Environmental Protection Agency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Bottom up approach; Cost of electricity; Duke University; Efficiency models; Electricity demands; Integrated resource planning; Supply function; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; Energy efficiency; demand elasticity; electricity generation; energy efficiency; energy resource; environmental protection; greenhouse gas; utility sector; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85056722709

Moreover, under the objective of cost minimize, the electrical power generation planning for each terms under different feasibility degrees (violating constraints or available resources situations) can be obtained. The results indicated that higher probability of violating system constraints would increase risk of system, but lower the total cost; the proportion of optimized thermal power generation and imported electricity would decrease, which could promote the energy conservation and emissions reduction in some degree.

In this study we calculated and compared the abatement costs of achieving multiple environmental targets with and without stacking under different policy regimes (emissions trading, charge, standards). To this end, a static mixed integer programming model was constructed. Theoretical analysis showed that, irrespective of policy regime, the cost of achieving predetermined emission targets is always lower when stacking is allowed. Another result was the excess abatement of pollutant under a no stacking system. Application to the Baltic Sea region showed that cost savings from stacking of pollutant abatement vary between policy regimes, being smallest for price regulation and highest for emission standards. However, the gains from stacking were unevenly distributed among the nine countries surrounding the Baltic Sea under all policy regimes, with Poland making the largest gain and Estonia, Russia and Latvia facing losses. Excess abatement without stacking in relation to the target was highest for nitrogen under all policy regimes, comprising up to 52% of the target abatement. © 2019 The Authors","Baltic Sea region; Cost-effectiveness; Interacting pollutants; Mixed integer programming; Stacking","abatement cost; climate change; cost analysis; cultivation; emission; environmental economics; mathematical analysis; pollutant; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea; Estonia; Latvia; Poland [Central Europe]; Russian Federation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068516417

This could be due to better N-use efficiency, but differences in microbial communities establishing in the rhizosphere may also play a role as the only known biological sink for N2O is its reduction to nitrogen gas (N2) by bacteria and archaea that possess the nosZ gene encoding the N2O reductase. Nitrous oxide reducing communities can be divided into two clades, I and II, and their relative abundance and diversity may have important consequences for N2O emissions. Here, we examine how intercropping with a legume (Medicago sativa, “lucerne”) and a grass (Dactylis glomerata, “cocksfoot”) species, compared to sole cropping of each species, affects the N2O emission potential, and the structure and abundance of root-associated N2O-reducing microbial communities. In a rhizobox experiment, we show that intercropping resulted in higher total shoot biomass compared to sole cropping. Further, N2O production rates were significantly higher in intercropped cocksfoot roots compared to sole cropping of either species. This coincided with lower abundances of nosZ clade II communities in intercropped compared to sole cropped cocksfoot roots, suggesting that these organisms likely act as a N2O sink. Phylogenetic placement of sequencing reads placed root-associated nosZ clade II reads close to Ignavibacteria and Opitutaceae, which harbour non-denitrifying N2O reducers with the genetic capacity to also perform dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium (DNRA). We observed a shift in the composition of the cocksfoot root-associated nosZI communities towards incomplete denitrifiers terminating with N2O in intercropped roots. Overall, we hypothesize that such alterations of plant-microbe and/or microbe-microbe interactions contributed to the higher potential N2O emission rate observed in intercropped cocksfoot roots. Understanding the nature of these interactions would represent an important step forward for the design of management practices that minimize N2O emissions. © 2019 The Authors","Denitrification; Nitrous oxide; nosZ; Rhizosphere","Bacteria; Denitrification; Gas emissions; Gene encoding; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Dissimilatory nitrate reduction; Emission potential; Greenhouse experiments; Management practices; Microbial communities; Nitrous oxide; nosZ; Rhizosphere; Plants (botany); alfalfa; ammonium; bacterium; gene expression; grass; greenhouse ecosystem; greenhouse gas; intercropping; nitrous oxide; rhizobacterium; rhizosphere; root; soil microorganism; Dactylis glomerata; Medicago sativa; Opitutaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069972151

Succulent plants use stored water to sustain metabolism during regular droughts; succulence is a highly successful adaptation that has evolved in thousands of species throughout the plant kingdom. Desert (xeromorphic) succulent species are a potentially relevant resource to manage environments and energy supply in the hottest and driest places. However, many species are threatened with extinction or could become invasive outside their natural range. This review highlights research needed to develop desert succulents as a sustainable resource in a carbon economy. Summary: Drought and increased temperature of the Earth's surface pose significant social and economic challenges under the anticipated effects of climate change. The presence of a reservoir of water to sustain metabolism under drought conditions is a conceptually simple, but remarkably complex, adaptation in the plant kingdom known broadly as succulence. The trait has arisen repeatedly among flowering plant lineages: thousands of succulent species representing immense taxonomic diversity are found on all continents except the polar regions. The phylogenetic diversity and ecological adaptations of desert-adapted (xeromorphic) succulent plants could be particularly relevant resources to meet the challenges of environmental change, in applications as varied as bioenergy, urban greening, and high-value products. However, a more complex picture is emerging in which xeromorphic succulents endemic to arid and semi-arid regions could be at risk of extinction due to habitat loss and exploitation, while others could become invasive if introduced outside their natural range, thus compounding an existing problem of invasive succulent plant species. This review aims to summarize the state of current knowledge of xeromorphic succulent plants as a resource, draw attention to conservation concerns, and examine the potential for their unique traits to be harnessed in a climate change-resilient world. © 2019 The Author, Plants, People, Planet © New Phytologist Trust","climate change; drought; resource; succulence; sustainable use; trait; water storage",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106018642

Anand Vihar was found to be most polluted and thus, selected as an AQCR. AERMOD performed satisfactorily in predicting pollutant concentration during winter and summer having an index of agreement in the range 0.54–0.80. PM10 and PM2.5 can be reduced substantially by increasing frequency of efficient mechanized cleaning of roads and sprinkling of water on the roads. Progressive decrease in NO2 concentrations can be achieved by restricting entry of truck in the study area through alternate path.

The default vegetation parameters from Global Land Cover 2000, currently incorporated into global climate models and used in regional climate model RegCM, are not realistic for China, which may have contributed to serious bias in surface climate simulation. In this study, a new set of vegetation parameters considering the Plant Functional Type (PFT) fractions and the corresponding monthly leaf area index (PFT_LAI), were developed based on the land cover and MODIS LAI data sets. The regional climate model RegCM4.5 coupled with the land surface model CLM4.5 were utilized to test the performance of the new vegetation parameters by comparing simulations with observations using different surface parameters. The surface energy balance was analysed to examine the effects of changed vegetation parameters on regional climate. The results showed that the new parameters were more accurate than the GLC2000 parameters when describing the distribution of crops, grassland, and forests over China. The improved vegetation parameters reduced model biases for winter air temperature and precipitation over southern China by 0.9°C and 8%, respectively, and reduced the winter temperature and summer precipitation biases over northeastern China by approximately 0.7°C and 8%, respectively. More accurate surface albedo are the main reasons for reductions in model bias. However, certain biases, such as the cold and dry bias over the Tibetan Plateau, still remained in the simulation results using our new vegetation data. © 2019 Royal Meteorological Society","China; CLM; improved climate simulations; plant functional type; RegCM","Land use; Vegetation; China; Climate simulation; Land surface modeling; Plant functional type; Realistic simulation; RegCM; Regional climate modeling; Vegetation parameters; Climate models; albedo; climate modeling; land use; leaf area index; regional climate; sampling bias; vegetation; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065789706

Across this region, temperature and precipitation influence the extent of the endemic region and number of Valley fever cases. Climate projections for the western United States indicate that temperatures will increase and precipitation patterns will shift, which may alter disease dynamics. We estimated the area potentially endemic to Valley fever using a climate niche model derived from contemporary climate and disease incidence data. We then used our model with projections of climate from Earth system models to assess how endemic areas will change during the 21st century. By 2100 in a high warming scenario, our model predicts that the area of climate-limited endemicity will more than double, the number of affected states will increase from 12 to 17, and the number of Valley fever cases will increase by 50%. The Valley fever endemic region will expand north into dry western states, including Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, Nebraska, South Dakota, and North Dakota. Precipitation will limit the disease from spreading into states farther east and along the central and northern Pacific coast. This is the first quantitative estimate of how climate change may influence Valley fever in the United States. Our predictive model of Valley fever endemicity may provide guidance to public health officials to establish disease surveillance programs and design mitigation efforts to limit the impacts of this disease. ©2019.

Calcium carbonate saturation state (ΩCaCO3) and pH would also increase meaning that AOA could alleviate sensitive regions and ecosystems from ocean acidification. However, AOA could raise pH and ΩCaCO3 well above modern-day levels, and very little is known about the environmental and biological impact of this. After treating a red calcifying algae (Corallina spp.) to elevated TA seawater, carbonate production increased by 60% over a control. This has implication for carbon cycling in the past, but also constrains the environmental impact and efficiency of AOA. Carbonate production could reduce the efficiency of CO2 removal. Increasing TA, however, did not significantly influence Corallina spp. primary productivity, respiration, or photophysiology. These results show that AOA may not be intrinsically detrimental for Corallina spp. and that AOA has the potential to lessen the impacts of ocean acidification. However, the experiment tested a single species within a controlled environment to constrain a specific unknown, the rate change of calcification, and additional work is required to understand the impact of AOA on other organisms, whole ecosystems, and the global carbon cycle. © 2018, The Author(s).","Artificial ocean alkalinization; Calcification; Carbon dioxide removal; Corallina spp; Ocean alkalinity","alkalinity; alkalinization; calcium carbonate; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; environmental impact; environmental response; ocean acidification; red alga; saturation; seawater; algae; Corallina",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85057124389

In such a complex framework of housing, social and economic interrelationships, cities become large consumers of resources and producers of greenhouse gases. Therefore, and in order to preserve resources and guarantee social services and the well-being of citizens, planning and policy actions are required that contribute to achieving sustainable growth. Beyond the environmental perspective, a socio-economic analysis is essential to make a comprehensive sustainability diagnosis of urban and rural systems. This paper presents a methodology for sustainability assessment, based on 38 indicators that include the three pillars of sustainability: social, economic and environmental. To carry out this assessment, 64 municipalities out of 313 located in Galicia (Northwest Spain) were selected and classified in three categories according to their population size (Medium Size, Small Size and Village). Moreover, two weighting methods have been considered (equal weighting and measured weighting attributed through Analytic Hierarchy Process method). The results show that most sustainable municipalities are located in the north of the region. On the other hand, regardless of the weighting method, 57% of the medium-sized municipalities are rated sustainable compared to 45% of those of the categories of Village and Small Size categories. Therefore, municipal size is relevant for measuring sustainability and there are no significant differences between the results obtained with the two weighting methodologies, indicating that the method developed is robust and could be applied to other municipalities and cities. © 2019","Rural areas; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable municipality; Triple bottom line; Urban sustainability","Economic analysis; Greenhouse gases; Knowledge management; Population statistics; Rural areas; Analytic hierarchy; Economic and social indicators; Sustainability assessment; Sustainable growth; Sustainable municipality; Triple Bottom Line; Urban sustainability; Weighting methodology; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067622588

Mutations in the human Parkin gene, PRKN, leads to degeneration of dopaminergic (DA) neurons, resulting in autosomal recessive early-onset parkinsonism and the loss of PRKN function is linked to sporadic Parkinson's disease (PD). Additionally, several in vitro studies have shown that overexpression of exogenous PRKN protects against the neurotoxic effects induced by a wide range of cellular stressors, emphasizing the need to study the mechanism(s) governing PRKN expression and induction. Here, Prkn was identified as a novel target gene of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor and member of the bHLH/PAS (basic helix-loop-helix/Per-Arnt-Sim) superfamily. AhR binds and transactivates the Prkn gene promoter. We also demonstrated that AhR is expressed in DA neurons and that its activation upregulates Prkn mRNA and protein levels in the mouse ventral midbrain. Additionally, the AhR-dependent increase in PRKN levels is associated with a decrease in the protein levels of its target substrate, α-synuclein, in an AhR-dependent manner, because this effect is not observed in Ahr-null mice. These results suggest that treatments designed to induce PRKN expression through the use of nontoxic AhR agonist ligands may be novel strategies to prevent and delay PD. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Parkin; Parkinson's disease; TCDD; α-Synuclein","alpha synuclein; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; cytochrome P450 1A1; messenger RNA; parkin; RNA 18S; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; actin; alpha synuclein; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; Cyp1a1 protein, mouse; cytochrome P450 1A1; messenger RNA; parkin; ubiquitin protein ligase; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; animal tissue; Article; brain tissue; controlled study; dopaminergic nerve cell; gene expression; gene targeting; liver tissue; mouse; mRNA expression level; neuropathology; nonhuman; Parkinson disease; priority journal; promoter region; protein expression level; protein induction; protein protein interaction; SH-SY5Y cell line; transactivation; transcription regulation; upregulation; ventral mesencephalon; animal; brain; cell line; gene expression regulation; genetics; human; knockout mouse; liver; metabolism; nerve cell; physiology; Actins; alpha-Synuclein; Animals; Brain; Cell Line; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Liver; Mice; Mice, Knockout; Neurons; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; RNA, Messenger; Ubiquitin-Protein Ligases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070618435

Two of the methods currently considered are desalination of seawater and reuse of mine-affected water based on the use of reverse osmosis (RO) membranes. Due to their high energy consumption and associated environmental impacts, these methods have been under scrutinity and, therefore, an LCA was undertaken for both methods. To allow comparison between the two, the functional unit of 1 kL of potable water was specified. Design data were collected for both the construction and operation phases of the plants while SimaPro was used as the LCA analysis software with the application of the ReCiPe Midpoint method. The results indicate that the operation phase carried a greater environmental burden than the materials required for the infrastructure. In particular, electricity production and consumption is responsible for the majority of environmental impacts that stem from the respective plants. The total energy consumption of the proposed desalination plant is 3.69 kWh/kL and 2.16 kWh/kL for the mine-water reclamation plant. This results in 4.17 kg CO2 eq/kL being emitted for the desalination plant and 2.44 kg CO2 eq/kL for the mine-affected plant. A further analysis indicated that replacing South African electricity with photovoltaic (solar) and wind power has the potential to bring significant environmental benefits. The integration of these renewable energy systems with desalination and membrane treatment of mine-affected water has been proven to reduce environmental burdens to levels associated with conventional water technologies powered by the current electricity mix. © 2019, South African Water Research Commission.

To investigate the scientific basis of the suggested environmental and health benefits offered by biodiesel, this review examines the current state of knowledge and key uncertainties of pollutant profiles of biodiesel engine exhaust and the associated the respiratory and cardiovascular outcomes. The ease and low cost of biodiesel production has facilitated greater distribution and commercial use. The pollutant profile of biodiesel engine exhaust is distinct from diesel, characterised by increased NOx and aldehyde emissions but decreased CO and CO2. Lower engine-out particulate matter mass concentrations have also been observed over a range of feedstocks. However, these reduced emissions have been attributable to a shift towards smaller sized particulate emissions. The toxicity of biodiesel engine exhaust has been investigated in vitro using various lung cell, in vivo evaluating responses induced in animals and through several human exposure studies. Discrepancies exist across results reported by in vitro and in vivo studies, which may be attributable to differences in biodiesel feedstocks, engine characteristics, operating conditions or use of aftertreatment systems across test scenarios.

Accurate climate change forecasts, therefore, depend on a reliable representation of mechanisms governing Arctic carbon cycle processes, but this task is complicated by the complex interaction of multiple controls on Arctic ecosystem changes, linked through both positive and negative feedbacks. As a primary example, predicted Arctic warming can be substantially influenced by shifts in hydrologic regimes, linked to, for example, altered precipitation patterns or changes in topography following permafrost degradation. This study presents observational evidence how severe drainage, a scenario that may affect large Arctic areas with ice-rich permafrost soils under future climate change, affects biogeochemical and biogeophysical processes within an Arctic floodplain. Our in situ data demonstrate reduced carbon losses and transfer of sensible heat to the atmosphere, and effects linked to drainage-induced long-term shifts in vegetation communities and soil thermal regimes largely counterbalanced the immediate drainage impact. Moreover, higher surface albedo in combination with low thermal conductivity cooled the permafrost soils. Accordingly, long-term drainage effects linked to warming-induced permafrost degradation hold the potential to alleviate positive feedbacks between permafrost carbon and Arctic warming, and to slow down permafrost degradation. Self-stabilizing effects associated with ecosystem disturbance such as these drainage impacts are a key factor for predicting future feedbacks between Arctic permafrost and climate change, and, thus, neglect of these mechanisms will exaggerate the impacts of Arctic change on future global climate projections. © 2019 The Authors.

Eutrophication and global warming are major challenges endangering mangrove ecosystem integrity. How these stressors affect seedling growth is not well understood. In a mesocosm experiment we grew mangrove seedlings in temperature-controlled chambers and investigated single and combined effects of temperature (23 and 33 °C), organic matter and dissolved nutrients on seedling trait morphology. Seedling survival was lowest in organic matter treatments. Combined effects of temperature and nutrients caused significant differences in root morphology with fewer but longer and thicker 3rd order roots, fewer 2nd and no 1st order roots in nutrient-enriched (23 °C) compared to non-enriched treatments (33 °C). Our results indicate these seedlings are less resilient to withstand their dynamic environment, in which they must settle and establish, due to lower root complexity.

Mesocosm experiments were conducted for 90 d to evaluate native, field-aged bed sediment PCBs, and ongoing input PCBs added 3 times a week. Simulated in situ remediation applied an activated carbon dose equal to the native organic carbon content that was premixed into the bed sediment for 1 mo. The highest bioaccumulation of native PCBs was in worms that remained in and directly ingested the sediment, whereas the highest bioaccumulation of the input PCBs was in fish that were exposed to the water column. When periodic PCB-contaminated sediment inputs were introduced to the water column, the activated carbon remedy had minimal effect on the input PCBs, whereas the native bed PCBs still dominated bioaccumulation in the control (no activated carbon). Therefore, remediation of only the local bedded sediment in environmental systems with ongoing contaminant inputs may have lower efficacy for fish and other pelagic and epibenthic organisms. While ongoing inputs continue to obscure remedial outcomes at contaminated sediment sites, the present study showed clear effectiveness of activated carbon amendment remediation on native PCBs despite these inputs but no remediation effectiveness for the input-associated PCBs (at least within the present study duration).

This area is an urban fringe with vast protected forests as buffer zone and catchment area for the city and surrounding area. Land conversion in this area will increase hazard risk of inundation, water quality decrease and increased CO2 emissions. Therefore, development should be maintained environmental stability. One of the rights applicated approach is carbon footprint that is capable to measure the balance between production and absorption needs of CO2 emissions. To find the optimal land allocation, we used carbon footprint calculation from the household activities, identify the factors of settlement growth, and use Linear Programming analysis.

Meanwhile, the development of settlement in North Balikpapan is affected by social demographic, developer initiative, environmental condition, public facilities availability, economical structure, and policy factors. According to those factors, optimal allocation of settlement area in North Balikpapan is only about 4,510.01 Ha.

While many acknowledge that the emissions are hazardous to health and environment,a universal determination and analysis method for the extent of the effect of soot is yet to be agreed. Against this background, this paper determines and analyzes the carbon footprint of an average family in Port Harcourt based on energy consumption and other sources of greenhouse gases. Using theinput-output approach and questionnaire, primary data werecollected on driving habits, energy generation, number of persons in the household, type of cooking device, travel mode and patterns, as well as fuel usage. The sampling instrument was administered to a random selection of 261 households within Port Harcourt that were identified and enrolled (through respective engagements) for the data gathering exercise. The sample population included family sizes that ranged from 1 to 12, in addition to a wide demographic mix. Data obtained from 61% of those contacted was used to determine associated CO2 emissions resulting from their family's activities. From cooking, electricity consumption, driving and air-travel, it was evidenced, based on the estimates, that the average family in Port Harcourt emits about 5.21tons of CO2e. Furthermore, it is revealed that by each person/family making minor changes to their daily routines, the cumulative effect of individual small savings will make significant impact in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and thereby climate change. Simple steps and policy actions are recommended for families to reduce their footprint. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Today, these systems are degraded, in large part due to changes in the hydroecology of waterways arising from water diversion and abstraction to sustain irrigated agriculture. The MDB Plan directs substantial investment towards the restoration of ecosystems largely via the buy-back of water allocations, under a cap-and-trade system, for use as environmental flows. This region is projected to receive less winter rainfall and run-off, which could exacerbate the impact of water diversions. Long-term climate records suggest a higher level of resilience to drying than may be inferred from modern studies. Further, palaeoecological records of change reveal that many wetlands that are perennial today were once naturally seasonal or intermittent, and that much wetland degradation predates regulation and can be attributed to declines in water quality, rather than quantity. A mix of approaches to rehabilitate this long-degraded system, planned and implemented over an extended period, may meet the demands of the Water Act of 2007, but also support the regional economy. An adaptive management approach offers a framework within which to map system vulnerabilities, characterize climate pressures, identify adaptation options, and monitor outcomes along a pathway to a sustainable future. Early lessons show the extent to which such a deliberative framework can assist water reform under changing socio-economic priorities and external hydroclimatic pressures. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","adaptation pathways; climate change; Murray–Darling Basin; paleolimnology; water resources; wetlands","adaptive management; climate change; floodplain; paleoclimate; paleoecology; paleolimnology; rainfall-runoff modeling; river management; water quality; water resource; wetland; Australia; Murray-Darling Basin",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070863162

Microbial biomass increased significantly with biochar addition at 10–20 cm soil depth but showed no response in the 0–10 cm depth soil layer. Compared to CK, biochar addition significantly affected the mean soil respiration rate during the two–year experiment, but the difference between CK and biochar treatments decreased both with time following biochar addition and with increasing biochar dosage. Annual cumulative soil respiration was significantly and positively correlated with the biomass of total PLFAs, gram-negative bacteria, bacteria, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (P &lt; 0.05) at 0–10 cm soil depth but not at 10–20 cm. Overall, only LB significant decreased the total CO2 emissions. Our results suggest that lower dosage additions of biochar have a positive effect in reducing total CO2 emissions and promote soil organic carbon sequestration in bamboo forests in subtropical China. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biochar; Microbial composition; Phospholipid-derived fatty acids; Soil CO2 emissions; Temperature sensitivity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065028774

Seasonal variability between November 2014, April 2015 and July 2015 in plankton respiration and bacterial (Bacteria + Archaea) metabolism is reported for the upper and bottom mixing layers at two stations in the Celtic Sea, UK. Upper mixing layer (UML, &gt;75 m in November, 41–70 m in April and ∼50 m in July) depth-integrated plankton metabolism showed strong seasonal changes with a maximum in April for plankton respiration (1.2- to 2-fold greater compared to November and July, respectively) and in July for bacterial production (2-fold greater compared to November and April). However UML depth-integrated bacterial respiration was similar in November and April and 2-fold lower in July. The greater variability in bacterial production compared to bacterial respiration drove seasonal changes in bacterial growth efficiencies, which had maximum values of 89% in July and minimum values of 5% in November. Rates of respiration and gross primary production (14C-PP) also showed different seasonal patterns, resulting in seasonal changes in 14C-PP:CRO2 ratios. In April, the system was net autotrophic (14C-PP:CRO2 &gt; 1), with a surplus of organic matter available for higher trophic levels and export, while in July balanced metabolism occurred (14C-PP:CRO2 = 1) due to an increase in plankton respiration and a decrease in gross primary production. Comparison of the UML and bottom mixing layer indicated that plankton respiration and bacterial production were higher (between 4 and 8-fold and 4 and 7-fold, respectively) in the UML than below. However, the rates of bacterial respiration were not statistically different (p &gt;.05) between the two mixing layers in any of the three sampled seasons. These results highlight that, contrary to previous data from shelf seas, the production of CO2 by the plankton community in the UML, which is then available to degas to the atmosphere, is greater than the respiratory production of dissolved inorganic carbon in deeper waters, which may contribute to offshore export. © 2017 The Authors","Bacterial growth efficiency; Bacterial production; Bacterial respiration; Dissolved organic carbon; Plankton community respiration; Shelf sea; Upper/bottom mixing layers","Bacteria; Biogeochemistry; Carbon dioxide; Efficiency; Metabolism; Mixing; Offshore oil well production; Organic carbon; Bacterial growth efficiencies; Bacterial production; Bacterial respiration; Dissolved organic carbon; Mixing layers; Plankton communities; Shelf sea; Plankton; bacterioplankton; bacterium; biological production; carbon cycle; dissolved inorganic carbon; dissolved organic carbon; metabolism; mixing; net primary production; respiration; shelf sea; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039425923

Los Castros s/n, Santander, 39005, Spain","The Mesolithic period in the Cantabrian region, a coastal area located in northern Spain, is characterised by a marked increase in the human use of coastal resources in comparison with previous periods, resulting in the formation of so-called “shell middens”. Archaeological investigations have provided insights into the formation processes of these shell middens, as well as long-term changes in human exploitation of different marine resources and the relationship of foraging strategies to past climate changes. However, efforts to reconstruct the key environmental factor governing coastal subsistence and foraging resilience, the seasonal availability and use of different marine resources, have been limited in the region and, indeed, across coastal Mesolithic Europe more widely. Here, we use stable oxygen isotope analysis of Phorcus lineatus (da Costa, 1778), one of the most widespread molluscs in northern Iberian mesolithic coastal sites, in order to determine the season in which humans collected key coastal resources at the site of EL Mazo (Llanes, Asturias). We demonstrate that P. lineatus was exclusively collected in late autumn, winter and early spring. An experimental programme, in which modern P. lineatus specimens were collected in situ over the course of three years, established that relative meat yield varied within this species throughout the annual cycle, with higher relative meat yield during colder months. We argue that mollusc collection patterns were driven by a cost-benefit principle during the Mesolithic in the Cantabrian region and human populations had intimate knowledge of the seasonal developmental cycles of exploited marine taxa. This also highlights the importance of developing intra-annual records of resource use and climate change if coastal foraging is to be properly understood in prehistory. © 2019, The Author(s).","Cantabrian region; Mesolithic; Relative meat yield; Seasonal subsistence; Shell middens; Stable oxygen isotopes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069640640

Results are compared with available satellite observations, including new trend estimates derived from the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry instrument on NASA's TIMED spacecraft. Modeled and observed trends are shown to be consistent throughout the entire middle atmosphere, from near the tropopause (~16 km) to the lower thermosphere (~95 km) in the period covered by the satellite data. Simulations are extended into the twenty-first century to document the evolution of the global-mean temperature trend profile. We find, consistent with previous studies, a marked change in the trend profile at the turn of the twenty-first century, which is driven by the recovery of stratospheric ozone following the adoption of the Montreal Protocol. In the twenty-first century, the trend profile becomes more uniform with altitude, but its overall shape and magnitude are conditioned by the scenario adopted for future emissions of greenhouse gases. Our results suggest that the vertical profile of temperature trends in the middle atmosphere will remain an important signature of global climate change, and they underscore the importance of global, continuous monitoring of this region of the atmosphere. ©2019.

The region also experiences atmospheric pollution caused by straw burning, which has become an important contributor to global warming. The goals of this experiment were to resolve the conflict between soil fertility and greenhouse gas emission when using straw return to the field and to identify the best balance between environmental protection and agricultural production. A randomized block design with three replicates was used. The design included three treatments based on the return of all winter wheat stalks to the field: (1) all summer maize stalks were pulverized mechanically and returned to the field (SR); (2) half of the summer maize stalks were pulverized mechanically and returned to the field (1/2 SR); and (3) all summer maize stalks were fully removed (control: CK). This long-term test was performed for 6 years. Straw returned to the field significantly increased greenhouse gas emissions. The cumulative CO2 emissions were higher by 32% under SR and by 17% under 1/2 SR compared with CK. The cumulative N2O emissions were higher by 28% under SR and 15% under 1/2 SR compared with CK. The greenhouse gas efflux increased with increased amounts of straw returned to the field. Compared with SR, 1/2 SR significantly reduced greenhouse gas emissions, while still ensuring sustainable soil fertility. Additionally, our research showed that the upper part of the corn stalk is better for generating biomass energy than the lower part. This study provides a theoretical basis for using the upper stalk for bioenergy and the lower stalk for direct return to the field for fertilization. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Double cropping system; Greenhouse gas emissions; Stover returned; Summer maize","Biomass; Crops; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Agricultural productions; Atmospheric pollution; Bio-mass energy; Double cropping; North China Plain; Residue management; Stover returned; Summer maize; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; agricultural emission; bioenergy; cropping practice; emission inventory; experimental study; greenhouse gas; maize; soil fertility; wheat; agricultural waste; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; climate; controlled study; crop management; cropping system; environmental protection; greenhouse gas; harvest; maize; plant stem; powder; priority journal; quantitative study; soil and soil related phenomena; soil fertility; summer; waste management; wheat; winter; agriculture; chemistry; China; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; maize; season; soil; China; North China Plain; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; Agriculture; China; Global Warming; Greenhouse Gases; Seasons; Soil; Triticum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067470702

In this research, a set of operations are proposed to reduce the chlorine percentage and the moisture content presented in this kind of waste, for its use as an alternative fuel in this production facilities. A washing of the waste under optimal conditions may reduce the chlorine content by approximately 50.0% of the original value and increase the lower calorific value by 8.0%. Drying the waste with a hot gas stream could produce a recoverable waste with a moisture content lower than 3.0%, which enables its temporary storage while avoiding its degradation. The use of an adequate amount of conditioned GAW can provide a substitute up to 51% of the conventional fossil fuel currently employed in the daily operation of the facility evaluated, leading to a reduction of the CO2 emissions associated with the decrease in the fossil fuel consumption.

CO2 is a greenhouse gas that can be converted into environmentally stable products through mineral carbonation, which has been pointed out as the most promising technology to reduce CO2 emissions and environmental impacts generated therefrom. Thus, this study presents an overview of the state of the art in terms of mineral carbonation research conducted between 2002 and 2018 with the aim of analyzing its evolution so as to identify the main scientific challenges in literature to indicate future research on it. The results reveal an increase in the number of publications and citations during the period under study and that there has been a fivefold increase in publications and citations on average in the latest five years. The analyzed works have made use of different kinds of industrial waste as raw material for mineral carbonation, whose most widely studied products were mining waste, Coal fly ash and Steelmaking slag. Mining waste is the most commonly studied material, which presents the greatest potential for mineral carbonation. Analyzes of recent articles have revealed that many challenges are yet to be overcome, such as the deployment of industrial carbonation technologies, mostly those that increase the efficiency of converting CO2 into carbonates and reduce its overall budget. Thus, further studies are needed with the aim of increasing the process reaction rate, reducing the use of chemical reagents and defining the mineralogical characteristics of raw materials in order to determine an ideal raw material for carbonation processes and analyze the market and profitability of products generated through mineral carbonation. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture; CCS; Mineral carbonation; Mineralization","Ashes; Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Chemical analysis; Digital storage; Environmental technology; Fly ash; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Minerals; Slags; Carbon capture and storages (CCS); Carbonation process; Chemical reagents; CO2 emissions; Coal fly ash; Mineral carbonation; Mineralization; State of the art; Carbon capture",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072135697

The inductive method was adopted from a case study and information was collected from primary and secondary sources. Based on the understanding of historical emissions, climate justice and global carbon budget, it is debated here whether LDCs should actually consent to everyone’s responsibilities even if they differ, since they have urgent needs to improve their development indexes, especially in terms of GDP and IDH. It is argued that the LDCs – whose historical contribution of emissions is around 0.4% of the total – should claim an increase in the share of the global carbon budget for economic and social development purposes. © 2019, Observare.

Typical JAZF1-SUZ12 ESS is slow growing, in which high uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) on positron emission tomography (PET) and subserosal masses are quite unusual. Case presentation: A 69-year-old Japanese woman complained of urinary incontinence. Pelvic magnetic resonance imaging showed uterine lesions composed of (1) a 9 × 8 × 7-cm mass protruding from the right-anterior wall, (2) a 4.5-cm mass attached to the right-posterior wall, and (3) a 6.5-cm intramural mass in the fundus. FDG-PET demonstrated maximum standardized uptake value of 13.28 confined to the two subserosal masses (1 & 2) in contrast to no uptake of the intramural mass (3). She was diagnosed with a high-grade uterine sarcoma concomitant with leiomyomas and underwent total hysterectomy with bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic lymphadenectomy. The removed uterus had three tumors - two in the right-anterior and right-posterior subserosa, respectively, and the remaining in the fundal myometrium. Microscopically, the three tumors shared morphologic features characterized by neoplastic cells similar to proliferative-phase endometrial stromal cells, in which neither round-cell component, pleomorphism, nor high mitotic activity was recognized. Nuclear cyclin D1 immunostaining was identified 50% of neoplastic cells in the two subserosal tumors (1 &2) whereas < 1% positive cells in the intramural component (3). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction showed the same-sized electrophoretic bands indicating JAZF1-SUZ12 gene fusion shared by the three uterine tumors and a focal tumor extension into the extrauterine vein. The patient is alive without evidence of recurrence at 14 months after surgery. Conclusions: Pathologists and clinicians should not exclude the possibility of JAZF1-SUZ12 ESS even when uterine subserosal masses demonstrate extraordinary FDG uptake on PET. Molecular analysis is helpful for diagnostic confirmation of JAZF1-SUZ12 ESS with a complex growth pattern. © 2019 The Author(s).","Cyclin D1; Endometrial stromal sarcoma; JAZF1-SUZ12; Positron emission tomography; Subserosal mass","corepressor protein; DNA binding protein; JAZF1 protein, human; polycomb repressive complex 2; SUZ12 protein, human; tumor protein; aged; case report; endometrium sarcoma; endometrium tumor; female; fluorescence in situ hybridization; genetics; human; pathology; procedures; tumor recurrence; Aged; Co-Repressor Proteins; DNA-Binding Proteins; Endometrial Neoplasms; Female; Humans; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Neoplasm Proteins; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Polycomb Repressive Complex 2; Sarcoma, Endometrial Stromal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073428253

Herein, we discuss the optimization of energy recovery from waste and how to reduce the environmental load of waste. First, we introduce the concept of upgrading waste-to-energy (WtE) processes to improve the exergy efficiency of society as a whole and provide guidance for selecting and combining the most appropriate technology for transforming waste-to-energy. We then propose a methodology called resource life-cycle assessment (LCA) that can be used to properly evaluate the effect of upgrading WtE processes and to optimize waste utilization not only within a given factory or municipality but also within society as a whole. Finally, we present two case studies with which we examine the direct and indirect upgrading of WtE processes and use resource LCA to quantitatively analyze the CO2 reduction achieved by upgrading WtE processes compared with that achieved by conventional WtE processes. The analysis of these case studies shows that upgrading WtE processes would result in approximately 50%–100% greater reduction in fossil fuel input compared with conventional waste power generation, which means that we expect a 50% to 100% greater reduction in CO2 emissions and the concomitant savings in fuel cost. The concept of upgrading WtE processes and resource LCA is useful for selecting a cost-effective option to improve the exergy efficiency both in developed countries and in developing countries, many of which need to contribute to their Nationally Determined Contribution under the Paris Agreement. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Burnable waste; Carbon dioxide; Energy recovery; Exergy; Life-cycle assessment","Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Developing countries; Environmental management; Exergy; Fossil fuels; Recovery; Appropriate technologies; Developed countries; Energy recovery; Environmental loads; Exergy efficiencies; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Low-carbon societies; Waste-to-energy systems; Life cycle; carbon; fossil fuel; carbon dioxide; energy efficiency; exergy; life cycle analysis; optimization; recovery; waste management; Article; carbon footprint; energy recovery; environmental policy; life cycle; methodology; process optimization; quantitative analysis; reduction (chemistry); technology; waste-to-energy; waste-to-energy plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068256605

Following extreme weather events, the media (including popular press and journalism) contributes to critical moments, where a potential window opens to transform public understandings of issues and challenges in established extreme event discourses. This paper examines government engagement with the media to better understand conditions of the post-event policy window from the perspective of critical discourse moments. More specifically, the paper uses keyword analysis and critical discourse analysis to examine discursive constructions of the post-event policy window following Hurricane Sandy by two city governments– Boston and New York. We contrast the language of city government engagement with media about post-disaster policy responses and compare this with the language of proposed city policies on climate risk adaptation and mitigation strategies. The outcomes of this analysis illustrate differences between government engagement with media in the post-disaster window and their eventual climate policy responses. The results raise questions regarding the influence of the media on post-disaster policy responses and focus attention on the proximity of an extreme weather event as potentially affecting the type of policy response (either proactive or reactive) by a governing body. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Discourse; Extreme events; media; Policy transitions; Policy window","article; attention; climate; disaster; discourse analysis; government; human; human experiment; language; Massachusetts; New York; weather",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067569123

The key role of biodiversity in securing human well-being is rarely considered a priority - instead short-term economic profits benefiting a few are prioritized. Particularly where local livelihoods rely on resources of protected areas for immediate survival, top-down enforced biodiversity conservation often increases social inequality, hunger and poverty and thus regularly fails. Identifying key knowledge gaps helps to adjust political priority setting and investment strategies to assess conservation threats and improve natural resource management. Since acting usually occurs at a local or regional scale, we focused on a priority conservation area in one of the world's poorest countries - the dry deciduous forests of western Madagascar. We aimed to identify key knowledge gaps in this area which need to be filled to better protect biodiversity and simultaneously ensure well-being of the local poor. We consulted 51 predominantly Malagasy experts using questionnaires. These questionnaires listed 71 knowledge gaps we collated from the literature which the experts were asked to rank by importance. Experts were encouraged to list additional knowledge gaps. Averaging the scores of all experts, we identified the top 10 knowledge gaps. Two political knowledge gaps addressing the need to determine strategies which improve law enforcement and reduce corruption ranked highest, followed by an ecological one concerning appropriate restoration and a socio-economic one regarding economic benefits locals gain from biodiversity. The general knowledge gap perceived as most important addressed strategies for long-term funding. Only one additional knowledge gap was identified: the impact of climate change-driven human migration from southwestern to central western Madagascar on socio-economic problems and its impacts on natural resources We linked the identified top 10 knowledge gaps as well as the additional knowledge gap suggested by experts to the SDGs, ABTs and 2 °C target of the Paris Climate Agreement, and discussed why these gaps were considered a priority.

The GEC is proposed with an industry-level perspective so as to provide detailed information about the extent to which the final demand of an industry of a country drives indirect CO2 emissions by any industry of any other country. The GET is defined as a simplified graphical structure of the GEC, which includes only the industries providing the highest contribution of CO2 emissions. The tools are described and new indices are developed with the aim of conducting multiple analyses with different purposes. Applications are given with specific emphasis to the different analyses that can be carried out.

Circumpolar marine risks are growing due to ship traffic increases linked to more ice-free open water, as well as increases in hazards for individuals that frequently travel on ice and trails in the region. While recent Government of Canada policies have attempted to respond to the growing risk of marine and coastal emergencies, there is strong evidence that the federal government and communities along Canada's Arctic coast are minimally prepared for the emerging risks. In this Short Communication, we argue that Canada is falling short of its international and national obligations to provide timely search and rescue across the Arctic, to the detriment of Arctic communities. Drawing from recently published reports and literature, we argue that providing additional training, resources, and support for volunteer SAR groups across the region is critical, along with increasing federal air and marine resources committed to the region.

In this study, we help Everglades restoration planning to bolster climate change resiliency by simulating plausible ecosystem responses to three climate change scenarios: a Baseline scenario of 2010 climate, and two scenarios that both included 1.5 °C warming and 7% increase in evapotranspiration, and differed only by rainfall: either increase or decrease by 10%. In conjunction with output from a water-use management model, we used these scenarios to drive the Everglades Landscape Model to simulate changes in a suite of parameters that include both hydrologic drivers and changes to soil pattern and process. In this paper we focus on the freshwater wetlands; sea level rise is specifically addressed in prior work. The decreased rainfall scenario produced marked changes across the system in comparison to the Baseline scenario. Most notably, muck fire risk was elevated for 49% of the period of simulation in one of the three indicator regions. Surface water flow velocity slowed drastically across most of the system, which may impair soil processes related to maintaining landscape patterning. Due to lower flow volumes, this scenario produced decreases in parameters related to flow-loading, such as phosphorus accumulation in the soil, and methylmercury production risk. The increased rainfall scenario was hydrologically similar to the Baseline scenario due to existing water management rules. A key change was phosphorus accumulation in the soil, an effect of flow-loading due to higher inflow from water control structures in this scenario. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon; Methylmercury; Peat; Phosphorus; Scenarios modeling; Sulfate","Carbon; Flow of water; Flow velocity; Mercury compounds; Peat; Phosphorus; Rain; Risk perception; Sea level; Soils; Sulfur compounds; Surface waters; Water management; Water supply; Biogeochemical process; Climate change scenarios; Freshwater wetlands; Methyl mercury; Restoration planning; Sulfate; Surface water flows; Water control structures; Climate change; fresh water; methylmercury; phosphorus; rain; surface water; biogeochemistry; climate change; landscape; methylmercury; modeling; peat; phosphorus; rainfall; sea level change; sulfate; Article; biogeochemistry; climate change; evapotranspiration; flow rate; human; landscape; sea level rise; warming; water management; wetland; ecosystem; Florida; forecasting; theoretical model; Everglades; Florida [United States]; United States; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Florida; Forecasting; Models, Theoretical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071283290

Appropriate solutions will depend on the effective promotion, monitoring and evaluation of changes in farming practice. Conservation agriculture (CA) is an important example of sustainable intensification and climate-smart agriculture, increasing the productivity and reliability of grain production while reducing agricultural inputs and future climate risks when adopted comprehensively. But to understand its implementation and benefits, researchers often rely on simplified measures of CA adoption (e.g., single proxies, binary measures, broad self-assessments, expert estimates). Here we use a national survey of South Africa's commercial grain farmers (n = 441), contextualized by previous interviews, to investigate common measures of adoption and their implications for CA's promotion, monitoring and evaluation. These farmers are unusually informative, because they are unsubsidized but have the capacity, incentive and willingness to adapt to climate change. We find that they are adopting CA autonomously, but that their implementation is highly variable and their interpretation of farming practice differs from that of local experts. Single proxies, binary adoption variables and broad farmer self-assessments suggest that between 40 and 80% of farmers have adopted CA. However, when evaluated across the three CA principles using UN-defined adoption thresholds, the comprehensive adoption rate is only 14%. Farmers’ definition of “conservation” differs substantially from that of the local experts most likely to be asked to contribute adoption estimates to global monitoring efforts, creating the potential for miscommunication. There is therefore substantial cause for concern in how CA is currently promoted, monitored and evaluated. Inaccurate adoption estimates jeopardize CA's potential as a climate change adaptation strategy, creating illusory progress that may disincentivize further substantive efforts towards agricultural sustainability and climate resilience. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change adaptation; Climate resilience; Conservation agriculture; South Africa; Sustainable agriculture","adoption; agricultural worker; article; climate change; grain; human; interview; major clinical study; monitoring; scientist; self evaluation; South Africa; sustainable agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067447705

In a climate change scenario possible adaptation measures include changes to establishment practices and tree management, better matching of species to site, both under current and future climates, and the planting of non-native species and provenances in anticipation of climate change. Current opinion is to encourage the planting of local provenances of native species, citing adaptation of provenances to local conditions, and the requirement to maintain biodiversity and a native genetic base. However, local provenances may not be able to adapt to a changing climate, particularly given the rate of change predicted. Sourcing planting stock from regions with a current climate similar to that predicted for the future may provide one option, although care must be taken to ensure that suitable provenances are selected which are not at risk from, for example, spring frost damage as a result of early flushing.

Furthermore, commonly used redox potential sensors provide only point measurements and are prone to error. This paper assesses whether combining electrical resistivity (ER) and self-potential (SP) measurements can allow the mapping of zones affected by anaerobic degradation. We use ER imaging because anaerobic degradation can release iron and manganese ions, which decreases pore water resistivity, and produces gas, which increases resistivity. Also, electrochemical differences between anaerobic and aerobic zones may create an electron flow, forming a self-potential anomaly. In this laboratory study, with four sand tanks with constant water table heights, time-lapse ER and SP mapped changes in electrical/electron flow properties due to organic contaminant (propylene glycol) degradation. Sampled pore water mapped degradation and water chemistry. When iron and manganese oxides were available, degradation reduced resistivity, because of cation release in pore water. When iron and manganese oxides were unavailable, resistivity increased, plausibly from methane production, which reduced water saturation. To bypass the reactions producing methane and release of metallic cations, a metal pipe was installed in the sand tanks between anaerobic and aerobic zones. The degradation creates an electron surplus at the anaerobic degradation site. The metal pipe allowed electron flow from the anaerobic degradation site to the oxygen-rich near surface. The electrical current sent through the metal pipe formed an SP anomaly observable on the surface of the sand tank. Time-lapse ER demonstrates potential for mapping degradation zones under anaerobic conditions. When an electrical conductor bridges the anaerobic zone with the near surface, the electron flow causes an SP anomaly on the surface. However, electrochemical differences between anaerobic and aerobic zones alone produced no SP signal. Despite their limitations, ER and SP are promising tools for monitoring redox sensitive conditions in unsaturated sandy soils but should not be used in isolation. © 2019","Degradation; Geobattery; Organic contaminant; Redox; Resistivity; Self-potential","Degradation; Electric conductivity; Electrons; Groundwater; Iron oxides; Manganese oxide; Mapping; Metals; Methane; Oxygen; Positive ions; Water tanks; Electrical conductors; Geobattery; Iron and manganese ions; Organic contaminant; Redox; Self potential; Self-potential anomalies; Unsaturated sandy soils; Redox reactions; cation; ground water; iron; manganese oxide; methane; oxygen; propylene glycol; anoxic conditions; biodegradation; electrical resistivity; groundwater; organic pollutant; redox conditions; water chemistry; Article; atomic emission spectrometry; degradation kinetics; electric conductance; electric potential; electric resistance; electrochemistry; electron transport; environmental monitoring; mathematical analysis; methanogenesis; oxidation reduction state; priority journal; sandy soil; water contamination; water sampling; electricity; oxidation reduction reaction; soil; soil pollutant; Electricity; Groundwater; Oxidation-Reduction; Soil; Soil Pollutants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068421145

This prediction imposes an implicit continuum of choices on all, ranging from: do nothing (beyond the status quo) to further prepare (paying the costs as they occur); through to invest now (in, for example, flood mitigation infrastructure) in the hope that such investments will reduce damage later. Good choices require good information. In this paper, we provide an empirical demonstration of one method (the life satisfaction approach) for generating quantitative estimates of both the tangible and intangible cost of disasters–the cost of doing nothing (beyond the status quo). We use data collected from almost 400 households in a flood prone region of the Philippines, finding that from 2008 to 2013, flooding generated an average of US$86 per annum in financial damages for each household. Our model predicts that the average respondent would require a one-off payment of between US$2,577 and US$3,221 (3.5 to 4.4 times the average annual income) to ‘compensate’ them for the additional intangible costs of flooding. Estimated total compensation exceeds estimated financial damage by about 1/3–suggesting that assessments, which do not account for intangibles may substantially underestimate the cost of doing nothing. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","climate change; Disaster risk Management; Economics; Southeast Asia","climate change; compensation; disaster management; flooding; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; life satisfaction; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85062349954

However, methanotrophs, bacteria capable of utilising methane as the sole source of carbon and energy, play a significant role in reducing the emissions of methane from many environments. Methylocella-like facultative methanotrophs are a unique group of bacteria that grow on other components of natural gas (i.e. ethane and propane) in addition to methane but a little is known about the distribution and activity of Methylocella in the environment. The purposes of this study were to identify bacteria involved in cycling methane emitted from natural gas seeps and, most importantly, to investigate if Methylocella-like facultative methanotrophs were active utilisers of natural gas at seep sites. Results: The community structure of active methane-consuming bacteria in samples from natural gas seeps from Andreiasu Everlasting Fire (Romania) and Pipe Creek (NY, USA) was investigated by DNA stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) using 13C-labelled methane. The 16S rRNA gene sequences retrieved from DNA-SIP experiments revealed that of various active methanotrophs, Methylocella was the only active methanotrophic genus common to both natural gas seep environments. We also isolated novel facultative methanotrophs, Methylocella sp. PC1 and PC4 from Pipe Creek, able to utilise methane, ethane, propane and various non-gaseous multicarbon compounds. Functional and comparative genomics of these new isolates revealed genomic and physiological divergence from already known methanotrophs, in particular, the absence of mxa genes encoding calcium-containing methanol dehydrogenase. Methylocella sp. PC1 and PC4 had only the soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) and lanthanide-dependent methanol dehydrogenase (XoxF). These are the first Alphaproteobacteria methanotrophs discovered with this reduced functional redundancy for C-1 metabolism (i.e. sMMO only and XoxF only). Conclusions: Here, we provide evidence, using culture-dependent and culture-independent methods, that Methylocella are abundant and active at terrestrial natural gas seeps, suggesting that they play a significant role in the biogeochemical cycling of these gaseous alkanes. This might also be significant for the design of biotechnological strategies for controlling natural gas emissions, which are increasing globally due to unconventional exploitation of oil and gas. © 2019 The Author(s).","Biological methane; DNA stable isotope probing; Facultative methanotrophs; Geological methane; Methylocella; Natural gas; Propanotrophs; Soluble methane monooxygenase; XoxF-methanol dehydrogenase","methane; methane monooxygenase; methanol dehydrogenase; natural gas; stable isotope; carbon; methane; natural gas; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; bacterium contamination; bacterium culture; bacterium isolate; carbon cycling; community structure; density gradient centrifugation; DNA DNA hybridization; DNA extraction; gene sequence; methanotrophic bacterium; Methylocella; microbial community; nonhuman; pH; priority journal; Beijerinckiaceae; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; phylogeny; Romania; United States; Beijerinckiaceae; Carbon; Methane; Natural Gas; Phylogeny; Romania; Soil Microbiology; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072930844

This study aims to investigate the underlying mechanisms and influencing factors associated with ammonium oxidation and nitrogen fixation in response to wetland-emergent aquatic plants. Methods: A field experiment was conducted to study the response of activity, abundance, and community structure of ammonia-oxidizers and diazotrophs to three wetland-emergent aquatic plants in summer and autumn. The root exudates and soil physicochemical properties were determined due to their important role in rhizosphere interactions. Results: AOR and NFR were significantly higher in rhizosphere than in bulk soils. The increases of AOR and NFR in rhizosphere were significantly positively affected by oxidation-reduction potential, additionally, NFR was also significantly affected by sugar-containing root exudates. Furthermore, NFR strongly correlated with diazotroph abundance, whereas AOR was linearly correlated with ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) activity and mostly determined by a specific AOA taxon. Conclusions: Emergent plant rhizosphere exhibited strong positive effects on AOR and NFR by altering community structure and abundance of related microorganisms.

Flue gas recirculation (FGR) is a functional way to reduce gas emission and reuse the waste heat of flue gas. Traditional FGR modes characterized low cycling ratio or worsened sintering indexes. In this paper, the flue gas compositions of each wind-box in sintering machine was measured. Based on the flue gas composition characteristics, these wind-boxes were partitioned into five regions to simplify the selection process of selective circulation. Main influence factors on sintering indexes of FGR were researched through sintering pot test. Methods of recirculating gas composition calculating and refined circulation modes establishing were proposed. Under the condition of suitable gas compositions and temperature for recirculation, including O2 ≥ 18%, H2O(g) ≤ 8%, SO2 ≤ 500 ppm, and T ≥ 200 °C, four feasible refined recirculation modes were obtained.

Therefore, when formulating carbon emission reduction policies for a province, it's necessary to consider the carbon emissions implied in trade. In this study, we established an interprovincial carbon flow analysis framework based on multi-regional input-output model, and we used China's 1997, 2002, 2007, and 2012 input-output data to make an empirical research of Hebei Province. The findings are as follows. Firstly, from 1997 to 2012, the embodied carbon emissions' net outflow of Hebei increased by 244.26 Mt, the number of the provinces that net inflowed carbon from Hebei increased from 18 to 22, and they extended from eastern coastal provinces and southern China to most parts of the country. Secondly, technological level and trade demand are the main factors affecting carbon emissions' net outflow, contributing −108.45 Mt and 352.71 Mt, respectively. On this basis, we developed a relationship model of the net outflow of carbon emission and commodity value to optimize the industrial development. Different from previous studies, our research has penetrated into every industry and every related province. We not only calculated the commodity transfer and embodied carbon transfer between Hebei Province and other provinces, and balanced the advantages and disadvantages of trade between key industries and provinces, then gave specific solutions and optimization measures, which has stronger practical meaning and guiding significance. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon transfer; Embodied carbon emissions; Interprovincial trade; Multiregional input-output model","Commerce; Emission control; Carbon emission reductions; Carbon transfer; Embodied carbons; Guiding significances; Industrial development; Input output model; Optimization measures; Spatial temporal analysis; Carbon; carbon emission; input-output analysis; international trade; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; trade-environment relations; China; Hebei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069843962

Moreover, upgrading the drainage system can have numerous negative environmental impacts on the city, especially in districts with dense population and buildings. A new integrated urban water management (IUWM) strategy implemented in China, ""sponge city,"" has gained significant attention in recent years. In this study, a novel framework is built to analyze the effectiveness of sponge city by 3D simulating urban inundation results and performing a cost-benefit analysis. Construction and maintenance fees are included in the costs list, and carbon reduction, air quality improvement, rainwater harvesting, and reduction of flood risk are included under benefits. The district of Nangang in Harbin city in Northeast China was chosen as a case study area. Finally, we conclude that the maximum precipitation of 49.82 mm/h by sponge city can bring the inundation depth below a target depth in the target area. Further, though the sponge city project is not effective from a private perspective, it is effective from a social perspective. © 2019 by the authors.","GIS; Integrated urban water management; Life cycle; Social cost and benefit; Sponge city","cost-benefit analysis; flood control; GIS; integrated approach; life cycle analysis; precipitation (climatology); urban area; water management; China; Harbin; Heilongjiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073606307

The increase in atmospheric CO2 as a consequence of fossil fuel combustion and land-use change is altering the stable carbon isotope composition (δ13C) of the atmosphere and ocean. This work investigates the application of using δ13C measurements of seawater samples to explore the biogeochemical responses of marine ecosystems to anthropogenic CO2 perturbations. The combination of isotopic and non-isotopic measurements from a subtropical North-Atlantic mesocosm experiment provided a holistic view of the biogeochemical mechanisms that affect carbon dynamics under a gradient of pCO2 ranging from ~350 up to ~1,000 μatm during a phytoplankton succession. A clear CO2 response was detected in the isotopic datasets with 13C shifts of up to ~5%0, but increased CO2 levels only had a subtle effect on the concentrations of the dissolved and particulate organic carbon pools. Distinctive δ13C signatures of the particulate organic carbon pools in the water column and sediment traps were detectable for the different CO2 treatments after a nutrient stimulated phytoplankton bloom. These signatures were strongly correlated (p &lt; 0.05) with the δ13C signatures of the inorganic carbon but not with the δ13C of the dissolved organic carbon pools (p &gt; 0.05). Fractionation of carbon isotopes in phytoplankton was positively affected (9.6 &lt; ε &lt; 16.5%0) by high CO2 levels either because of the higher CO2 availability or because of a shift in phytoplankton community composition. Nevertheless, phytoplankton bloom intensity and development was independent of CO2 concentrations, and higher CO2 levels had no significant effect on inorganic nutrient uptake. Results from this mesocosm experiment showed that variations in the carbon isotopic signature of the carbon pools depend on both physical (air-sea exchange) and biological (community composition) drivers opening the door to new approaches for investigations of carbon cycling in marine ecosystems. © Copyright © 2019 Esposito, Achterberg, Bach, Connelly, Riebesell and Taucher.","carbon cycle; marine biogeochemistry; mesocosm experiment; ocean acidification; stable carbon isotopes",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073680843

However, climate change will affect tree species survival and persistence in urban ecosystems. Tree failures will cause economic losses and jeopardize the delivery of societal benefits. The impacts of climate change will depend on the species’ resilience and adaptive capacity, as well as management actions which may ameliorate some of the negative impacts. Here, we assessed the potential vulnerability of Australia's urban forests to climate extremes. Our results can be used for future urban planning aiming to incorporate species that are well-adapted to the hotter, drier climates expected with climate change. Summary Urban forests (UFs) are recognized for the multiple benefits they provide to city-dwellers. However, global climate change—particularly predicted increases in the frequency and intensity of heatwaves and drought—will affect tree species’ performance and survival in urban ecosystems. Here, we assessed species composition and potential vulnerability of UFs in 22 Australian significant urban areas (SUAs) to heat and/or moisture stress. We quantified species’ realized climatic niches across their known distribution, and assessed the extent to which baseline climate in the SUAs where a particular species is planted fell within its niche. We used three environmental variables to group species based on their potential climate vulnerability. UFs varied in species composition and climate vulnerability across the continent. In general, neither climate similarity nor geographical proximity were good predictors of species composition among UFs. Of 1,342 tree species assessed (68.4% natives), 53% were considered potentially vulnerable to heat and/or moisture stress in at least one city where they are currently planted. Our results highlight the climate vulnerability of current plantings across Australian SUAs and can be used to direct future species selection that considers the species’ climate of origin and climatic niche. UF planning can incorporate species from SUAs with similar climates and with low vulnerability to contemporary, as well as future climate conditions. Species with high climate vulnerability, in contrast, may require more intensive management to avoid failure under future hotter, drier climate conditions. © 2019 The Authors.

For instance, invasive plant species have greater vegetation phenological sensitivity to climate change than native plant species in some regions, and hence invasion could modify how ecosystem carbon gain responds to increased drought frequencies expected with climate change. Results from a 4-yr drought experiment show that invasion reduced ecosystem potential for carbon gain via increased sensitivity to reduced rainfall. Using canopy greenness (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index, NDVI) as a proxy for potential ecosystem carbon gain, we show that areas invaded by herbaceous species had up to a 70% reduction in maximum NDVI under severe drought conditions as compared to areas dominated by native shrubs. Phenological differences between herbaceous- and shrub-dominated vegetation contributed to this reduction in potential ecosystem carbon gain because invaded areas had delayed green-up, especially under drought conditions, and shrub senescence was accelerated by drought. Hence, invasion by herbaceous species and increased drought frequencies are likely to act synergistically to reduce ecosystem capacity for carbon gain in this system. Our findings suggest that predicting ecosystem responses to future climate change could be improved by projecting of the spread of invasive species and accounting for phenological variation between native and invading species. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","climate change; coastal sage scrub; drylands; exotic species; Mediterranean type ecosystem; Normalized Difference Vegetation Index","biological invasion; canopy architecture; climate change; climate effect; drought stress; herb; Mediterranean environment; NDVI; net ecosystem production; phenology; scrub; shrub; synergism; climate change; drought; ecosystem; introduced species; plant; Climate Change; Droughts; Ecosystem; Introduced Species; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071246058

It was observed that researchers have proposed a lot of unique approaches to managing solid waste generation; with emphasis on perfect waste collection and disposal, but these approaches are very expensive considering the tight budgeting expenses Nigeria is faced with. This study shows that some rural communities experience huge post-harvest organic wastes from their farms and the cost of these losses has been estimated, which then forms a good spot to start the implementation process for this initiative. The research highlights the overview benefits of adopting microbial and pyrolysis approach in converting the lignocellulosic aspect of these waste to economically viable products that will have a direct positive impact on the immediate community. This study proposed a modified fast pyrolysis approach in the conversion process to reduce the production of pyrolytic gas and optimize the production of biochar and pyroligneous acid. Adopting these approaches will reduce the amount of carbon emitted into the atmosphere when burning these waste and produce bio-products instead of synthesized chemical products that have health implications. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

This policy seeks to improve public health and reduce emissions contributing to global warming. It is, however, very likely that more walking, cycling and use of public transport will be associated with an increase in traffic injury. Moreover, it is likely that most of this increase will go unnoticed and not be recorded in official road accident statistics. Official statistics on traffic injury are known to be very incomplete as far as injuries to pedestrians, cyclists and public transport passengers are concerned. This incompleteness is a problem when assessing health impacts of more walking, cycling and travel by public transport. In this paper, studies made in the city of Oslo, Norway (population 700,000) are used to develop numerical examples showing how the estimated real and recorded number of injuries may change when 10% of person km of travel performed by car are transferred to walking, cycling or public transport.

The ∆47 data typically requires several standardization steps and one of which heavily relies on true or equilibrium Δ47 values from different temperatures. However, they have not yet been experimentally quantified and only theoretically predicted Δ47 values are available to the community (e.g., Wang et al. 2004). In this study, a series of CO2 gases were cleaned using a custom-designed automated CO2 cleaning system, baked in a pre-cleaned dry quartz tube and then measured for their ∆47 values (the CBM protocol) to examine ∆47 change kinetics of CO2 gas over a heated quartz surface between 50 and 1100 °C. In another test, a series of CO2 gases were baked first, cleaned subsequently, and finally measured for their ∆47 values (the BCM protocol) to evaluate the effect of the CO2 cleaning on the ∆47 value in a routine ∆47 measurement. Our experimental results showed that ∆47 value of the CO2 gas over a heated quartz surface attained thermodynamic equilibrium in 191, 7, 0.23 and 0.1 h at 50, 100, 491 and 1000 °C, respectively. We also reported the first experimentally determined equilibrium ∆47–T relation in CO2 gas between 50 and 1100 °C as follows (∆47 in ‰, T in °C; R2 = 0.99, P &lt; 0.0001): Absolute∆47=0.9791±0.0029×e−0.0045T The comparison between the two CO2 preparation protocols also revealed that the CO2 cleaning step after the baking in the BCM protocol could alter the original ∆47 signature of CO2 gas by 0.04 and 0.07‰ at 100 and 1000 °C, respectively, increasing the empirical transfer function (ETF) slope to &gt;1. Therefore, the isotope scrambling effect reported in the literature (e.g., Dennis et al. 2011) might be resulted from CO2 cleaning process because isolating the CO2 cleaning effect (before the baking) yielded an ETF slope of 1, implying that instrumental or analytical artifacts that could affect the measured ∆47 were not significant. We suggest using a set of heated CO2 gases prepared by the BCM protocol from several different temperatures as an alternative for the conventional use of heated and water-equilibrated CO2 gases to construct an absolute reference frame and standardize Δ47. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,"Cleaning; Gases; Isotopes; Quartz; Temperature; Analytical artifact; Cleaning effect; Cleaning process; Clumped isotopes; Formation temperature; Isotope scrambling; Reference frame; Thermodynamic equilibria; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; equilibrium; isotopic analysis; isotopic composition; oxygen isotope; quartz; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070502662

Catheter loss is associated with increased hospitalization and high inpatient costs. Sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) demonstrates anti-infective and anticoagulation properties with a good safety profile, making it an ideal lock solution development target. The objective of this study was to determine the safety and efficacy of using sodium bicarbonate catheter lock solution (SBCLS) as a means of preventing HD catheter loss due to CRT and CRBSI. Methods: The study took place in a community hospital in Brooklyn, NY, USA. All admitted patients ≥18 years of age who needed HD treatment through CVC were included in the study. 451 patients included in the study were provided SBCLS or NSCLS post-dialysis. Catheter loss due to CRT or CRBSI was evaluated over a period of 546 days. Results: A total of 452 patients met the criteria; 1 outlier was excluded, 226 were in the NSCLS group and 225 were in the SBCLS group. There were no significant differences between groups in comorbidities at the outset. The NSCLS group had CRT and CRBSI rates of 4.1 and 2.6/1000 catheter days (CD), respectively, compared with 0.17/1000 CD for both outcomes in the SBCLS group. SBCLS patients had a significantly reduced catheter loss rate due to CRT (P &lt; 0.0001) and CRBSI (P = 0.0004). NSCLS patients had higher odds of losing their catheter due to CRT {odds ratio [OR] 26.6 [95% confidence interval (CI) 3.57-198.52]} and CRBSI [OR 15.9 (95% CI 2.09-121.61)] during the study period. Conclusion: The novel approach of using SBCLS was found to be safe and was statistically superior to normal saline in preventing HD catheter loss due to CRT and CRBSI. NaHCO3 solution is inexpensive, readily available in various settings and holds the potential to decrease hospitalization, length of stay and dialysis-related costs.

Additionally, there is little information on the effect of the consumption of halophytic plant species on the emission of fermentation gas by ruminants. This context was aimed to assess the chemical composition, mineral contents, and fermentation gas mitigation properties of nine different halophytic plants species, collected from south-eastern region of Iran. The minerals such as calcium (Ca), sodium (Na), and potassium (K) were estimated using atomic absorption spectroscopy, and phosphorus (P) by spectrophotometer. The mineral contents of halophytes were within the usual ranges. The rate of fermentation gas production (GP) among plants was calculated according to the standard protocol in a time-dependent manner (2–96 h) and revealed the characteristics of these halophytes. The GP was reduced for halophytes from vegetative and flowering stages to seed ripening stage. Parameters such as metabolisable energy, organic matter digestibility, and digestible organic matter in dry matter were estimated and observed to be decreased (P < 0.05) among different growth stages of halophytes. The evaluation of chemical constituents, mineral components, and other parameters established the promising role of these halophytic plant species as efficacious forage resources for ruminants. Furthermore, these halophytes may be used as valuable feeding stuffs for ruminants due to the mitigation characteristics of fermentation gas and less use of energy-rich supplements, respectively. © 2018, Springer Nature B.V.","Chemical composition; Gas production; Halophytes; Mineral components; Ruminants","detection method; dry matter; fermentation; gas production; growth; halophyte; organic matter; reaction kinetics; ruminant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85053390361

This study assessed the performance of land surface temperatures (LSTs), retrieved from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Aqua platform, over Egypt. Eight-day composites of daytime and nighttime LST data were aggregated and validated against near-surface seasonal and annual observational maximum and minimum air temperatures using data from 34 meteorological stations spanning the period from July 2002 to June 2015. A variety of accuracy metrics were employed to evaluate the performance of LST, including the bias, normalized root-mean-square error (nRMSE), Yule-Kendall (YK) skewness measure, and Spearman's rho coefficient. The ability of LST to reproduce the seasonal cycle, anomalies, temporal variability, and the distribution of warm and cold tails of observational temperatures was also evaluated. Overall, the results indicate better performance of the nighttime LSTs compared to the daytime LSTs. Specifically, while nighttime LST tended to underestimate the minimum air temperature during winter, spring, and autumn on the order of -1.3, -1.2, and -1.4 °C, respectively, daytime LST markedly overestimated the maximum air temperature in all seasons, with values mostly above 5 °C. Importantly, the results indicate that the performance of LST over Egypt varies considerably as a function of season, lithology, and land use. LST performs better during transitional seasons (i.e., spring and autumn) compared to solstices (i.e., winter and summer). The varying interactions and feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere, especially the differences between sensible and latent heat fluxes, contribute largely to these seasonal variations. Spatially, LST performs better in areas with sandstone formations and quaternary sediments and, conversely, shows lower accuracy in regions with limestone, igneous, and metamorphic rocks. This behavior can be expected in hybrid arid and semi-arid regions like Egypt, where bare rocks contribute to the majority of the Egyptian territory, with a lack of vegetation cover. The low surface albedo of igneous and limestone rocks may explain the remarkable overestimation of daytime temperature in these regions, compared to the bright formations of higher surface albedo (i.e., sandy deserts and quaternary rocks). Overall, recalling the limited coverage of meteorological stations in Egypt, this study demonstrates that LST obtained from the MODIS product can be trustworthily employed as a surrogate for or a supplementary source to near-surface measurements, particularly for minimum air temperature. On the other hand, some bias correction techniques should be applied to daytime LSTs. In general, the fine space-based climatic information provided by MODIS LST can be used for a detailed spatial assessment of climate variability in Egypt, with important applications in several disciplines such as water resource management, hydrological modeling, agricultural management and planning, urban climate, biodiversity, and energy consumption, amongst others. Also, this study can contribute to a better understanding of the applications of remote sensing technology in assessing climatic feedbacks and interactions in arid and semi-arid regions, opening new avenues for developing innovative algorithms and applications specifically addressing issues related to these regions. © 2019 by the authors.","air temperature; Egypt; Lithology; LST; MODIS; Validation","Arid regions; Atmospheric temperature; Biodiversity; Climate change; Energy utilization; Igneous rocks; Information management; Land use; Lime; Limestone; Lithology; Mean square error; Metamorphic rocks; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Solar radiation; Surface measurement; Surface properties; Water management; Air temperature; Arid and semi-arid regions; Egypt; Moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer; MODIS; Near-surface measurements; Sensible and latent heat fluxes; Validation; Land surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074212677

Variation of injection pressure was conducted in three representative operation points in the single-cylinder engine including conventional and wave piston bowl types. Additionally, detailed optical combustion studies were performed in a high pressure/high temperature combustion chamber with an engine-like flame-wall interaction geometry. The fuel properties mainly influenced parameters relating to events near the nozzle, such as the ignition delay, flame lift-off distance and spray air entrainment. Oxygenation of the fuel reduced soot formation (a known effect of spray-jet dilution), but the fuels’ H/C and T95 also influenced soot emissions. Viscosity, heating value and density, treated as secondary fuel parameters, affected the injected fuel's kinetic energy, and hence mean flow field and local turbulent mixing late in the combustion cycle. The results suggested that fuel effects on soot oxidation during late phases of combustion are mainly governed by parameters related to the fuel injection profile under the specific cylinder gas conditions. With an oxygenated fuel, flow structures (local turbulent side vortices) which are typical for the investigated engine type were found to form in a similar way as with a reference fuel. Hence, improved internal flow using a wave piston in combination with a low-sooting oxygenated fuel gave additional reductions in net soot emissions. © 2019","Diesel combustion; Fuel properties; Late cycle mixing; Piston bowl shape; Soot oxidation; Wave piston","Air entrainment; Air pollution control; Combustion chambers; Diesel engines; Direct injection; Dust; Exhaust gas recirculation; Gas emissions; Hydrogen fuels; Kinetic energy; Kinetics; Mixing; Nitrogen oxides; Oxidation; Pistons; Soot; Spray nozzles; Diesel combustion; Diesel engine combustions; Direct injection diesel engines; Flame-wall interaction; Fuel properties; High pressure/high temperature; Hydrogen-to-carbon ratio; Soot oxidation; Engine pistons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067344639

They will be more diminished in size and heavily fragmented (especially in lowland wet forests), have reduced structural and species complexity, be increasingly restricted to steeper, less accessible areas, and be missing many heavily hunted species. These changes, in turn, will greatly reduce the quality and quantity of ecosystem services that tropical forests can provide. Driving these changes will be continued clearance for farming and monoculture forest plantations, unsustainable selective logging, overhunting, and, increasingly, climate change. Concerted action by local and indigenous communities, environmental groups, governments, and corporations can reverse these trends and, if successful, provide future generations with a tropical forest estate that includes a network of primary forest reserves robustly defended from threats, recovering logged and secondary forests, and resilient community forests managed for the needs of local people. Realizing this better future for tropical forests and people will require formalisation of land tenure for local and indigenous communities, better-enforced environmental laws, the widescale roll-out of payments for ecosystem service schemes, and sustainable intensification of under-yielding farmland, as well as global-scale societal changes, including reduced consumerism, meat consumption, fossil fuel reliance, and population growth.

The neurotrophic factor artemin (Artn) is highly expressed in the epidermis of AhR-CA mice and causes hypersensitivity to itch (alloknesis) by elongating nerves into the epidermis. However, whether the Artn gene is regulated directly by AhR or indirectly through complex regulation associated with AhR remains unclear. To this end, we previously conducted chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing analyses of the Artn locus and found a xenobiotic response element (XRE) motif located far upstream (52 kb) of the gene. Therefore, in this study, we addressed whether the XRE actually regulates the Artn gene expression by deleting the region containing the motif. We generated two lines of ArtnΔXRE mice. In the mouse epidermis, inducible expression of the Artn gene by the AhR agonist 3-methylcholanthrene was substantially suppressed compared to that in wild-type mice. Importantly, in AhR-CA::ArtnΔXRE mice, Artn expression was significantly suppressed, and alloknesis was improved. These results demonstrate that the Artn gene is indeed regulated by the distal XRE-containing enhancer, and alloknesis in AhR-CA mice is provoked by the AhR-mediated direct induction of the Artn gene.

Lancaster Ave., Villanova, PA  19085, United States","Evapotranspiration (ET) is a viable runoff reduction mechanism and an important player in the hydrologic cycle of vegetated green stormwater infrastructure (GSI). As a dynamic process, ET is dependent on both meteorological factors (e.g., rainfall characteristics, relative humidity, and air temperature) and GSI properties (e.g., soil media type). This paper investigates the role of ET in runoff volume reduction of green roofs and rain gardens through a comprehensive literature review. Evapotranspiration is mostly unaccounted in the design and crediting of GSI systems because of the complex interaction of soil, plants, and climate that makes its quantification difficult. To improve vegetated GSI design for runoff volume reduction, design methods should consider ET and infiltration processes concurrently. Two methods, complex and simple, are reviewed and discussed herein. The simple method requires minimal input information compared to the more complex continuous simulation method; however continuous simulation yields volume reduction values more similar to field observations. It is demonstrated that modifying the drainage structure and using fine-grained in-situ soils can potentially increase ET in vegetated GSI systems. None of the available ET predictive equations, mostly derived from agricultural sciences, are found to precisely match observed GSI ET data. Until further research is conducted on GSI ET estimation methods, the 1985 Hargreaves method is recommended when performing continuous simulations. The 1985 Hargreaves method is simple, requires limited input data that are readily available, and generates reasonable results.

However, transnationally governed adaptation initiatives are emerging and increasing in scale. This paper analyses the effectiveness of transnational adaptation initiatives as a particular knowledge gap in this changing evolving governance landscape. Based on a new dataset of 40 initiatives that are governing adaptation across borders and that include non-state actors, it offers an overview assessment. It asks: do transnational adaptation initiatives achieve their stated goals and objectives, and which factors explain their ability to contribute to effective climate change adaptation? Drawing on transnational climate and sustainable development governance literature, an analytical framework is developed to assess to what extent ‘actors’, ‘process’, ‘institutional design’ and ‘context’ can explain effective outcomes. The assessment found that while almost two-thirds of the initiatives were highly effective in achieving goals and objectives by producing outputs, only one-third were highly effective in achieving outcomes, in the sense of leading to substantial change in behaviour of target groups. Where initiatives are effective, the main factors determining success are strong leadership and orchestration, good process management and staff resources, a focus on standard-setting and service provision rather than knowledge transfer, a high level of institutionalisation through binding rules for partners, and good coordination with international regimes. Perhaps less expected in view of the voluntary involvement of actors in transnational adaptation initiatives, initiatives based on ‘hard’ functions (i.e. standard-setting and service provision as opposed to knowledge transfer) and binding rules for partners were found to be more effective. © 2019, The Author(s).","Adaptation; Effectiveness; Non-state actors; Transnational governance","adaptive management; climate change; governance approach; management practice; service provision; sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066487503

There is a pressing need to develop a robust management strategy via enhancing the resiliency of the community, particularly in the context of complex urban environments, like Jakarta. Resilience is conceptualized within specific contexts and uniquely tailored to the targeted setting, yet research regarding the operational concept of a flood-resilient community in the context of Jakarta remains limited. This paper will elaborate this operational concept through understanding the desirable features and influential barriers of a flood-resilient community through the lenses of three main stakeholder groups: disaster risk reduction (DRR), climate change adaptation (CCA), and development. It will also discuss the ways in which the synergies that exist across these groups can be enhanced. Both quantitative and qualitative approaches were applied in this study, and multiple sources of data were used. The findings indicate that these groups share common views regarding the importance of human aspects being central to resilience building efforts. We argue there is an urgent need to shift the flood resilience building paradigm towards building community resilience from the people and to apply a collaborative governance approach to facilitate effective partnership between the actors involved. © 2019 by the authors.

One important part of cover crop management is termination. With smaller profit margins and constraints on time and labor, producers are searching for ways to reduce time and labor required to terminate cover crops while maintaining or increasing profitability. This study examined the effect of 11 different combinations of terminating cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) and planting cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) on population, seed cotton yield, total costs and net returns; and how combined operations affect labor, fuel consumption and carbon (CO2) emissions in a conservation system. Cereal rye followed by cotton was planted in central Alabama during the 2009-2011 crop years. Treatments included cotton planted directly into standing cereal rye, cover crops terminated at early milk growth stage using mechanical (roller or roller/crimper) with or without chemical termination (spraying) followed by cotton planting, and cover crop termination combined with cotton planting using spraying with or without rolling termination. While the 2011 crop year had the lowest plant populations, there was no year effect on seed cotton yields, total costs or net returns. Rolling with or without spraying yielded higher plant populations (26%), seed cotton yields (18.3%) and net returns (17.2%) than cotton planted into standing rye; however, rolling with or without spraying also had 23.8% higher costs due to increased fuel usage, machinery and labor hours, and yield varying costs. While rolling with spraying had slightly higher total costs compared with rolling alone (6.5%), plant populations, seed cotton yields and net returns were 11.42%, 6.4% and 6.5% higher, respectively. Converting from three separate operations for cover crop termination and cotton planting to rolling and spraying combined with planting, producers could potentially reduce CO2 emissions from fuel use and labor hours associated with cover crop termination and cotton planting by up to 51%. © 2017 Cambridge University Press.","Cereal rye; combining operations; conservation systems; cover crops; net returns; smooth roller; straight bar roller/crimper","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; conservation; cotton; cover crop; crop production; fuel consumption; labor; profitability; Alabama; United States; Embryophyta; Gossypium hirsutum; Secale cereale",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85039546994

However, the major issues of nitrate (NO3−-N) residue and instability in the current combination of nitritation and anammox process necessitates being addressed efficiently. The recently proposed partial-denitrification (PD), terminating NO3−-N reduction to nitrite (NO2−-N), has been regarded as a promising alternative of NO2−-N supplying for anammox bacteria. Given the engineering practices, the steadily high NO2−-N production, alleviating organic inhibition, and reducing greenhouse gas of PD process offers a viable and efficient approach for anammox implementation. Moreover, it allows for the extending applications of anammox process due to the NO3−-N removal availability. Here we comprehensively review the important new outcomes and discuss the emerging applications of PD-based anammox including the process development, mechanism understanding, and future trends. Significant greater stability and enhanced nitrogen removal efficiency have been demonstrated in the novel integrations of PD and anammox process, indicating a broad perspective in dealing with the mainstream municipal sewage, ammonia-rich streams, and industrial NO3−-N contained wastewater. Furthermore, researches are still needed for the predictable and controllable strategies, along with the detailed microbiological information in future study.

Rapid observations of the land surface temperature (LST) are, therefore, valuable for studying the dynamics of wetland systems. With the development of thermal remote sensing technology, LST retrieval with satellite images is a practicable way to detect a wetland and its neighboring area’s thermal environment from a non-point visual angle rather than the traditional detection from a point visual angle. The mono-windows (MW) method of retrieving LST was validated. On the basis of estimated LST, we used Geographical Information System (GIS) technology to study the impact of wetland reclamation on local temperatures at a regional scale. Following that, correlations between LST and the wetland were analyzed. The results show that: 1) It is feasible to retrieve the LST from Landsat 8 OLI satellite images with MW model. The model was validated with the land surface temperature observed in four meteorological stations when the satellite scanned the study region. The satellite retrieval error was approximately 1.01°C. 2) The relationship between the spatial distribution of land surface temperatures and the Zhalong wetland was analyzed based on GIS technology. The results show that wetland has an obvious influence on LST, and that this influence decreases with increasing distance from the wetland. When the distance from the wetland was less than 500 m, its influence on LST was significant. Results also illustrated that the effect of the wetland’s different land use/land cover’s LST distribution varied with different seasons. © 2019, Science Press, Northeast Institute of Geography and Agroecology, CAS and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","cold-humid effect; influence distance; land surface temperature; Zhalong wetland",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074569365

Consequently, innovative solutions to reduce methane emissions from livestock farming are required to ensure future sustainable food production. One possible approach is the use of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), Gram positive bacteria that produce lactic acid as a major end product of carbohydrate fermentation. LAB are natural inhabitants of the intestinal tract of mammals and are among the most important groups of microorganisms used in food fermentations. LAB can be readily isolated from ruminant animals and are currently used on-farm as direct-fed microbials (DFMs) and as silage inoculants. While it has been proposed that LAB can be used to reduce methane production in ruminant livestock, so far research has been limited, and convincing animal data to support the concept are lacking. This review has critically evaluated the current literature and provided a comprehensive analysis and summary of the potential use and mechanisms of LAB as a methane mitigation strategy. It is clear that although there are some promising results, more research is needed to identify whether the use of LAB can be an effective methane mitigation option for ruminant livestock. © Copyright © 2019 Doyle, Mbandlwa, Kelly, Attwood, Li, Ross, Stanton and Leahy.","bacteriocins; direct-fed microbials; lactic acid bacteria; methane; methanogens; mitigation; silage inoculants","bacteriocin; lactic acid; methane; probiotic agent; antibacterial activity; antifungal activity; antimicrobial activity; bacterial strain; beef cattle; colony forming unit; fermentation technique; gastrointestinal tract; gene sequence; genome; Gram positive bacterium; incidence; intestine flora; lactic acid bacterium; Lactobacillus; meta analysis (topic); methanogenesis; microbial community; morbidity; nonhuman; Propionibacterium acnes; Review; ruminant",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073675403

The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) can reallocate reservoir storage to respond to such changes. We assembled and analyzed a database of reservoir reallocations implemented and proposed by the Corps. While only a small portion of total reservoir storage nationwide has been reallocated, there are substantial differences in reallocation frequency and magnitude across the nation: some Corps Districts and Divisions use reallocation while others do not, relying more on discretion and small-scale adaptation of operations. This difference illustrates how water resource agencies like the Corps decentralize management decisions to allow responding to disparate conditions. Decentralized decision-making provides a responsive approach to water management, while centralized and hierarchical decision-making is a slower, more deliberative approach. Decentralized decision-making may lead to the accumulation of short-term, local decisions over time to the point that the system is managed differently than anticipated. Reallocation, which is a form of planned adaptive management, can be accommodating of multiple competing demands and different stakeholders, yet expensive and less temporally responsive. The challenge for any large water resource management agency is to balance between local-level, responsive discretion vs. centralized, planned decision-making. © 2019 American Water Resources Association","planning; rivers/streams; water allocation; water policy; water supply","Planning; Reservoir management; Reservoirs (water); Water management; Water supply; Decentralized decision making; Hierarchical decisions; Management decisions; Reservoir operation; Rivers/streams; Water allocations; Water policies; Waterresource management; Decision making; adaptive management; armed forces; decentralization; decision making; hierarchical system; operations technology; reservoir; water management; water planning; water supply; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069925833

Development of emission inventory and mitigation approaches needs accurate estimation of individual emission from animals under various physiological conditions and production systems. This research investigated the effect of different dietary concentrate contents on feed intake, growth performance, nutrient digestibility and CH4 emissions of heifers at various stages, and also developed linear or non-linear prediction equations using data measured by sulphur hexafluoride tracer technique. Increasing dietary concentrate contents increased feed intake and growth rate, enhanced nutrient digestibility, and reduced enteric CH4 emissions. Heifers at the age of 9, 12, and 15 months with an average weight of 267.7, 342.1, and 418.6 kg produced 105.2, 137.4, and 209.4 g/day of CH4, and have an average value of CH4 energy per gross energy intake (Ym) 0.054, 0.064, 0.0667, respectively. Equations relating CH4 emission values with animal and feed characteristics were developed with high determination coefficients for heifers at different growth stages.

Fuel staging, a technique in which the fuel flow to a multinozzle combustor is unevenly distributed between the nozzles, has been shown to mitigate the intensity of self-excited combustion instabilities in multiple nozzle combustors. In our previous work, we hypothesized that staging suppresses instability through a phase-cancelation effect in which the heat release rate from the staged nozzle oscillates out of phase with that of the other nozzles, leading to destructive interference that suppresses the instability. This previous theory, however, was based on chemiluminescence imaging, which is a line-of-sight integrated technique. In this work, we use high-speed laser-induced fluorescence to further investigate instability suppression in two staging configurations: center-nozzle and outer-nozzle staging. An edge-tracking algorithm is used to compute local flame edge displacement as a function of time, allowing instability-driven edge oscillation phase coherence and other instantaneous flame dynamics to be spectrally and spatially resolved. Analysis of flame edge oscillations shows the presence of convecting coherent fluctuations of the flame edge caused by periodic vortex shedding. When the system is unstable, these two flame edges oscillate together as a result of high-intensity longitudinal-mode acoustic oscillations in the combustor that drive periodic vortex shedding at each of the nozzle exits. In the stable cases, however, the phase between the oscillations of the center and outer flame edges is greater than 90 deg (~114 deg), suggesting that the phase-cancelation hypothesis may be valid. This analysis allows a better understanding of the instantaneous flame dynamics behind flame edge oscillation phase offset and fuel staging-based instability suppression. © 2019 by ASME",,"Combustors; Fuels; Gas emissions; Nozzles; Stability; Thermoacoustic engines; Vortex flow; Vortex shedding; Acoustic oscillation; Chemiluminescence imaging; Coherent fluctuation; Combustion instabilities; Destructive interference; Heat Release Rate (HRR); Integrated techniques; Thermoacoustic combustion; Combustion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074642971

However, effective building design strategies could significantly improve buildings' energy and indoor climate performances under both current and future climate conditions. The simulations show that the cooling energy demand of the analyzed building in the Greater Accra region is 113.9 kWh/m2 for the recent climate, and this increases by 31% and 50% for the projected climates for 2030 and 2050, respectively. For the analyzed building in the Ashanti region, the cooling energy demand is 104.4 kWh/m2 for the recent climate, and this increases by 6% and 15% for the 2030 and 2050 climates, respectively. Furthermore, indoor climate and comfort deteriorate under the climate change conditions, in contrast to the recent conditions. © 2019 by the author.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Climate change mitigation and adaptation; Design strategies; Energy performance; Residential buildings; Thermal comfort; Tropical climate",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074457862

Indeed, the integration of these materials into building envelopes will simultaneously reduce energy use and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission rates. In this context, the thermal performance of bio-based insulation materials is studied and compared to that of conventional insulation materials. However, the majority of these studies, concentrated especially in Europe, lack economic analysis. Cultivated for centuries in Morocco, the use of hemp in the building industry is very limited. The aim of this study is to assess the use of hemp as insulation material for Moroccan external building walls located in Meknes, a city characterized by the Mediterranean climate Csa. Firstly, time lag and decrement factor are investigated in order to assess the dynamic thermal behavior of an external multilayer wall insulated with hemp wool. Afterwards, based on a life cycle cost analysis (LCCA), optimum hemp wool thickness, energy savings and payback period are determined for an analysis period of 20 years. Using a computer program developed in Matlab, an implicit finite difference method is applied to solve the 1D heat equation and investigations are carried out for different wall orientations. It was found that highest optimum insulation thicknesses are provided by east and west orientations (5 cm) followed by the southern and the northern ones (4 and 3 cm, respectively). In addition, an air gap layer is introduced to the optimal insulated multilayer wall, and a third investigation is conducted. The optimal air gap thickness is determined based on the analysis of various thermal parameters such as Prandtl, Rayleigh and Nusselt numbers, conduction, convection and radiation heat transfer rates. For all wall orientations, optimum air gap thickness was found equal to 1.3 cm. Annual GHG emissions were also calculated and it was found that they can be decreased by about 71% with the use of optimum thicknesses of hemp wool and air cavity insulations. Finally, a comparative study with the recommendations set by the Moroccan thermal regulation is conducted. The findings showed that our investigated configuration would be more efficient from thermal, economical and environmental points of view. © 2019 Institution of Chemical Engineers","Cooling and heating transmission loads; Energy savings; Hemp wool; Life-cycle cost; Optimum air gap thickness; Optimum insulation thickness",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069940124

This paper presents the results of climate change impact assessment on a typical mid-rise residential building in four representative cities with different climatic characteristics in Turkey. Three different scenarios that characterize different solutions towards space cooling are developed, from naturally ventilated to fully air-conditioned. The energy requirements and corresponding CO2 emissions due to space conditioning as well as occupant thermal comfort are the investigated building performance metrics. The preliminary results based on energy simulations indicate that pronounced overheating will be experienced in the future, which will have a strong effect on cooling energy use and/or occupant comfort. The projected energy demand also points to the future need to explore measures for climate change adaptation of buildings and the importance of the decarbonization of the electricity industry for climate change mitigation.

The LCA model of car sharing is proposed, the global warming potential (GWP) of four car sharing models is determined, and the effect on GWP of urban transportation is explored. This study expanded the LCA of products to the LCA of services, by expanding the functional unit to service. In this study, the time dimension was considered during the functional unit setting. It was found that there are large GWP differences among different car sharing models. Electric vehicle car sharing models have less GWP than gasoline vehicle car sharing models. The dispatch distance and the numbers of passengers in one car are two key factors for GWP of car sharing models. When car sharing replaces ~10% and ~50% of private cars, the GWP reduction potentials of urban transportation are ~4% and ~20%, respectively. The overall distribution of car sharing should be set by considering the features of different models in different areas, to achieve the largest environment benefit by using car sharing in cities. Therefore, car sharing can be used as a measure for significant GWP reduction for city transportation. © 2019","Car sharing; Electric vehicle; GHG reduction; GWP; Life cycle assessment; Transportation","Electric automobiles; Electric vehicles; Global warming; Life cycle; Transportation; Environment benefits; Functional units; Gasoline vehicle; GHG reductions; Global warming potential; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Private vehicles; Reduction potential; Urban transportation; car use; electric vehicle; emission control; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; public transport; urban transport; Article; car driving; car sharing; carbon footprint; China; economic aspect; electric vehicle; energy consumption; environmental impact; gasoline vehicle; greenhouse effect; human; life cycle assessment; motor vehicle; priority journal; simulation; traffic and transport; urban area; urban transportation; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068108396

In this study, we found that 70.2 ± 0.2% of DDT disappeared in the presence of SRB and graphite powder, a model PCM, after 21 days at pH 7. Our results suggest that the observed DDT decay was due to the reaction between graphite powder and the reduced sulfur species that were produced by SRB. No biofilm formation was observed on the surface of graphite powder. Rather, the activity of SRB was inhibited by the presence of graphite powder. To understand the involvement of PCM in DDT decay, electrochemical cells and batch reactor experiments with sulfur-pretreated PCM as well as direct electrochemical reduction by a potentiostat were employed. Our results suggest that polysulfide, sulfide, sulfite, and thiosulfate could all react with PCM, forming surface-bound intermediates that subsequently led to DDT decay.

In the present study, two broad spectrum fungicides, chlorothalonil and carbendazim, were applied at the rates of 5, 10, and 50 mg of active ingredient (A.I.) per kg of dry soil combined with urea with 200 mg of N per kg of dry soil under laboratory conditions. The results showed that chlorothalonil obviously retarded the hydrolysis of urea, whereas carbendazim accelerated it in 4 days after the treatments (P &lt; 0.05). Chlorothalonil reduced denitrification, nitrification, and N2O production (P &lt; 0.05), but not for carbendazim. Further analysis on N-associated microbial communities showed chlorothalonil reduced nitrosomonas populations at the rates of 10 and 50 mg of A.I. per kg and autotrophic nitrifying bacterial populations at three application rates (P &lt; 0.05), but Carbendazim decreased nitrosomonas populations only at the rate of 50 mg of A.I. per kg and also autotrophic nitrifying bacterial populations at three rates and heterotrophic nitrifying bacterial populations at the rates of 10 and 50 mg of A.I. per kg. The reasons for this difference were ascribed to arrest urea hydrolysis and impediment of denitrification and nitrification processes by chlorothalonil.

We found that the impact on daily maximum eight-hour (MDA8) O3 concentration by the meteorological variation that mostly increased O3 was greater than that from emission reduction, which decreased O3. Specifically, the control measures implemented since 2013 in China have reduced SO2, NOx, PM2.5, and VOC emissions by 33%, 25%, 30%, and 4% in 2017, while NH3 emissions have increased by 7%. The changes in anthropogenic emissions lowered MDA8 O3 by 0.4–3.7 ppb (0.8%–7.6%, varying by region and month), although MDA8 O3 was increased slightly in some urban areas (i.e. North China) at the beginning/end of warm seasons. Relative to 2013, the average 2 m temperature in 2017 shows increments in North, North-east, East, and South China (0.34°C–0.83°C) and decreases in Central China (0.24°C). The average solar radiation shows increments in North, North-east, and South China (7.0–9.7 w/m2) and decreases in Central, South-west, and North-west China (4.7–10.3 w/m2). The meteorological differences significantly change MDA8 O3 by −3.5–8.5 ppb (−8.2%–18.8%) with large temporal variations. The average MDA8 O3 was slightly increased in North, North-east, East, and South China. The response surface model suggests that the O3 formation regime transfers from NOx-saturated in April to NOx-limited in July on average in China.

Biomass resources such as municipal solid waste, agricultural residue food processing industry waste, energy crops are a common type of renewable energy source and it help to produce energy, chemicals, and fuels. The useful energy recovered from biomass can be effectively utilized by a bio-energy conversion technique known as pyrolysis. Pyrolysis is considered as a kind of thermo-chemical conversion technique of waste material in the inert atmosphere to harvest biochar, syn-gas and bio fuel. Bio fuel harvest from forestry biomass through the microwave pyrolysis technology has been significantly attracting attention in the renewable energy sector over recent years. This is because of fact that microwave pyrolysis can possibly reduce greenhouse gases and contribute to energy security. A simulation model of pyrolysis process is developed by using a software called advanced system for process engineering it is basically a simulation tool for computer-aided energy modelling. This software is used to optimize and analyse the efficiency of the process involved in pyrolysis and to increase the output product yield such as bio-oil, syn-gas, and biochar with respect to the function of input parameters such as pyrolysis temperature and physio-chemical character of the biomasses. The ASPEN PLUS simulation is carried out using four different variety of biomasses namely Acacia Nilotica, Calophyllum inophyllum seed, rice husk, and Bael shell.

Indeed, the biodegradable organic matter of MSW undergoes anaerobic digestion producing the landfill gas (LFG), whose main components are CH4 and CO2. Therefore, biomethane energy exploitation in MSW landfills will reduce GHGs emission positively affecting the global warming. The aim of the present study was to assess the methane production in a Sicilian landfill by comparing the results from field measurements of methane emission and the estimates achieved by applying different mathematical models. A subsequent energetic/economic analysis was carried out based on the Italian incentive mechanisms. Two different scenarios were simulated for LFG valorization considering either internal combustion engines or micro gas turbines. The evaluation of the economic viability was performed by applying the classic models of the Net Present Value and Internal Rate of Return. The results of the present study showed that the LFG produced in the investigated landfill could be profitably used as energetic source and the economic income due to thermal and electrical energy valorization might positively contribute to the landfill management.

The sustainability of rice production systems can be measured based on economic, environmental, social, and institutional indicators. In this paper, we restrict our assessment to economic and environmental indicators. During 2012–2015, farmers were interviewed from 847 households from intensively irrigated rice production regions in Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Myanmar, Sri Lanka, and China. We assessed the sustainability of their farming practices using economic and environmental indicators, i.e., eight of the 12 performance indicators (PIs), as defined by the Sustainable Rice Platform (SRP). Across the six sites, there was a yield gap of 24–42% and a profit gap of 36–82% between the 10% highest-performing farms (mean of top decile) and the mean-performing farms. In addition, there was a labor productivity gap of 12–32%, a nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) gap of 11–20%, a phosphorus use efficiency (PUE) gap of 1–29%, and a water productivity gap of 12–42%. Deliberate modification of conventional practices, including not flooding the field for >30 days before rice planting, incorporating pre-rice crop residue >30 days before planting, and adoption of mid-season drainage or alternate wetting and drying irrigation rather than continuous flood irrigation during the rice growing period, could substantially reduce the greenhouse gas (GHG) emission in irrigated rice fields without yield penalty. There is an urgent need to adopt improved management strategies for nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K) fertilizer, irrigation water-use efficiency, as well as for decreasing pesticide use frequency, without sacrificing profitability and yield. We identified the following priority interventions for each site: a) increasing fertilizer use and adopting higher-yielding varieties in Bago, Myanmar; b) reducing pesticide application rates in Can Tho, Vietnam; c) reducing fertilizer use in Guangdong, China; d) reducing nitrogen and labor use in Yogyakarta, Indonesia; e) reducing fertilizer and water use in Polonnaruwa, Sri Lanka and; f) reducing fertilizer use in Nakhon Sawan, Thailand. Additional uses of the PI analysis clearly demonstrated that rice yield and profit gaps can sustainably be closed by increasing efficiencies that will also lead to reduced environmental footprint. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Economic sustainability; Environmental sustainability; Greenhouse gas emission; Nitrogen use efficiency; Profit gap; Sustainable intensification; Water productivity; Yield gap","Agricultural wastes; Cultivation; Efficiency; Floods; Greenhouse gases; Irrigation; Nitrogen fertilizers; Pesticides; Phosphorus; Productivity; Profitability; Water management; Water supply; Economic sustainability; Environmental sustainability; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Sustainable intensification; Water productivity; Yield gap; Sustainable development; agricultural intensification; comparative study; cropping practice; cultivation; emission inventory; environmental economics; environmental indicator; greenhouse gas; intensive agriculture; profitability; rice; sustainability; water use; yield response; Can Tho; China; Guangdong; Indonesia; Nakhon Sawan; North Central Province; Northern Region [Thailand]; Polonnaruwa; Sri Lanka; Thailand; Viet Nam; Yogyakarta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066474450

Therefore, to understand the plasma behavior of under C5F10O-N2 mixtures, the composition, thermodynamic properties and transport properties of the C5F10O-N2 mixtures in a temperature range of 300K to 30000K and a pressure range of 0.1 MPa to 0.8 MPa is calculated under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium. Then, the influence of mixing ratios and pressures are analyzed. The results can be used to determine the optimal proportion of C5F10O-N2 mixtures. Several peaks of the specific heat can be observed below 5000K, which could be a favorable factor for arc quenching. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Dielectric properties of gases; Global warming; Mixtures; Specific heat; Environmental-friendly; Global warming potential; High dielectrics; Liquefaction temperatures; Local thermodynamic equilibrium; Plasma behavior; Pressure ranges; Temperature range; Liquefaction of gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073749295

However, few studies have investigated the effects of air pollutants on human longevity, especially based on the total regional quantities and sources. Based on investigation of the spatiotemporal variations of three air pollutants (PM10, SO2, and NOx) and three longevity indicators (centenarian ratio, centenarity index, and aging tendency), this study aims to identify the relationship between air pollution and regional longevity in Guangxi Province. Air pollutant and population data from 109 counties and areas of Guangxi were collected from environmental research reports and statistical yearbooks. Cluster and outlier analysis was used to detect the regions with high and low clusters of the longevity indicators and air pollutants. Geographically weighted regression analyses were performed to determine the relationship between longevity and air pollutants. A negative relationship between the air pollutants PM10, SO2, and NOx on the aged population was observed. From a provincial level, industrial sources from the urban areas of cities located in the central province, including Liuzhou, Nanning, Laibing, Guigang and Yulin, were important contributors to the air pollutants PM10, SO2, and NOx, and thus could contribute to negative impacts on regional longevity. The key findings from this study will provide a case for management of air pollutants based on public health policies in China as well as other developing communities. © 2019 by the authors.

Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions are the main greenhouse gas emissions in wastewater treatment plants. In this study, the greenhouse gas emission sources in a wastewater treatment plant were determined. Direct (from fossil fuel combustion, methane emissions, and process emissions of the other greenhouse gases) and indirect emissions (primarily from electricity use) in the plant were monitored. The optimum influent characteristics and operating conditions have been defined by using Monte Carlo simulation to minimize the emissions. The results revealed that the highest direct greenhouse gas emission was observed in August with the value of 23.328 kg CO2-eq d–1 and the lowest emission was 7.56 kg CO2-eq d–1 measured in January. The aeration tank is a major source of greenhouse gas emissions. Indirect emission has occurred because of the anaerobic digester but the biogas has been cogenerated in the plant, so it has been ignored for the calculation. According to the simulation study, if the plant is operated under optimum operating conditions, it can emit the lowest amount of greenhouse gas emissions. The optimum removal values required for the minimum greenhouse gas emissions are 79% for chemical oxygen demand, 75% for biochemical oxygen demand, and 82% for total suspended solid. The optimum operating conditions for the aeration tank, which is the major source of emission, are 5.33 h of hydraulic retention time, 0.215 d of solid retention time, and 0.999 for food/microorganisms. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. © 2019 Society of Chemical Industry and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","CH4 emission; CO2 emission; greenhouse gases; minimization; Monte Carlo simulation; wastewater treatment plant","Biochemical oxygen demand; Carbon dioxide; Chemical industry; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Intelligent systems; Methane; Monte Carlo methods; Nitrogen oxides; Optimization; Oxygen; Reclamation; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage tanks; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; CO2 emissions; Environmental problems; Hydraulic retention time; Influent characteristics; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; Nitrous oxide emissions; Optimum operating conditions; Wastewater treatment plants; Greenhouse gases; carbon emission; emission control; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; methane; Monte Carlo analysis; retention; source identification; wastewater treatment plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070801004

The study assesses the causal significance of procedure and performance as sources of legitimacy, unpacks these dimensions into specific institutional qualities, and offers a comparative analysis across IOs in three issue areas of global governance. Theoretically, the article disaggregates institutional sources of legitimacy to consider democratic, technocratic, and fair qualities of procedure and performance. Empirically, it examines the effects of these institutional qualities through a population-based survey experiment in four countries in different world regions with respect to IOs in economic, security, and climate governance. The findings demonstrate that both procedure- and performance-related aspects of IO policymaking matter for popular legitimacy beliefs. This result holds across democratic, technocratic, and fair qualities of IO procedure and performance. Disaggregating the results by issue area indicates that a broader scope of institutional qualities are important for legitimacy beliefs in economic governance compared to security governance and, especially, climate governance. These findings suggest that propositions to reduce the institutional sources of IO legitimacy to single specific qualities would be misguided.

Consequently, there is a diversity of interpretations of the concept at the public-political arena both nationally and internationally. Recent Latin American efforts have given a step forward conceptualizing environmental governance from the South and systematizing experiences to illustrate a diverse contemporaneous reality. At a regional scale, within the last decades, discursive turns in national policies such as the introduction of the sustainable development concept have triggered an increase in studies and applications of environmental governance (e.g., forest's governance, climate change, marine coastal zones) including the use of the ecosystem services concept. The instrumentation of public actions in relation to environmental governance derives from the states. However, if analyzed with a beyond-the-States view, governance can be understood as a process involving the participation of governmental and non-governmental actors reaching decisions, for mutual benefits, through negotiation processes. However, there is not, still, within the countries of the region, inclusive and participative governance oriented toward the sustainable use of natural resources. Although there are many challenges, in this chapter we discuss two of them: (1) to build an analytical framework to understand the environmental governance modes currently available in Latin America and (2) to generate a new sociopolitical interdisciplinary framework involving both natural and sociopolitical systems as a contribution to a new analytical framework for environmental governance. In other words, new environmental governance for Latin America. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

Land use, and the associated management practices, is one of the major drivers which can deeply impact soil properties. To better understand the dynamics of soil chemical properties and to assess potential impact of land use, an improved monitoring of chemical signature in organo-mineral topsoils is necessary. Here, we explored how land use (forests or agrosystems i.e. olive-tree orchards) may shape soil chemical signature and whether it depends i) on the type of agricultural or sylvicultural practices, ii) on contrasted Mediterranean climate conditions at different spatial scales. We measured variations in soils properties by FTIR-ATR (Fourier-Transformed Infrared – Attenuated Total Reflectance) spectroscopy and elemental concentrations. FTIR showed that the aromatic fraction of organic matter and CaCO3 discriminated soils under different land uses (orchards or forests) and this depended on climate (sub-humid vs humid climate). Moreover, the chemical signatures of soils varied with the practices applied. For agrosystems, soils complemented with olive-mill wastes were characterized by aromatics compared to soils under natural grass or tillage. For forests, soils from Pinus spp. stands and Quercus spp. stands were discriminated by CaCO3 and aromatics respectively. Contrasted climate conditions at local scale, i.e. northern vs southern slopes for forests and distance from the sea (coastal vs inland area) for agrosystems, had an effect on soil chemical signature. The AcomDIM interpretation of FTIR-ATR signals showed that factors “land use”, “practices” and “climate” and their interactions could have a significant impact on soil chemical signature. PLS modeling also confirmed that FTIR-ATR is a useful tool to predict a type of land use depending on climate. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","AcomDim; Agricultural practices; FTIR-ATR; Land use; Mediterranean soils; PLS","Aromatization; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Chemical properties; Forestry; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Land use; Orchards; Soils; AcomDim; Agricultural practices; Attenuated total reflectance; Elemental concentrations; FT-IR-ATR; Mediterranean climates; Mediterranean soils; Soil chemical property; Climatology; calcium carbonate; organic matter; climate effect; forest soil; FTIR spectroscopy; infrared spectroscopy; land use; Mediterranean environment; orchard; prediction; reflectance; soil chemistry; topsoil; Article; chemical analysis; chemical composition; climate; climate change; concentration (parameter); elemental analysis; environmental factor; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; forest; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; fractionation; geographic mapping; grass; humidity; infrared spectroscopy; land use; mineralization; molecular interaction; oak; olive; orchard; pine; predictive value; priority journal; reflectometry; seashore; soil analysis; soil property; Southern Europe; tillage; vegetation; agriculture; chemistry; environmental protection; infrared spectrophotometry; olive tree; procedures; soil; Quercus; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Forests; Olea; Soil; Spectrophotometry, Infrared",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066787185

However, such estimates at regional and local scales are still highly uncertain. Airborne Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR) and Hyperspectral Imaging (HSI) can characterize the structural and functional diversity of forests with high accuracy at a sub-meter resolution, and potentially improve the AGB estimations. In this study, we compared the ability of different data sources (airborne LiDAR and HSI, and their combination) and regression methods (linear model - LM, linear model with ridge regularization - LMR, Support Vector Regression - SVR, Random Forest - RF, Stochastic Gradient Boosting - SGB, and Cubist - CB) to improve AGB predictions in the Brazilian Amazon. We used georeferenced inventory data from 132 sample plots to obtain a reference field AGB and calculated 333 metrics (45 from LiDAR and 288 from HSI) that could be used as predictors for statistical AGB models. We submitted the metrics to a correlation filtering followed by a feature selection procedure (recursive feature elimination) to optimize the performance of the models and to reduce their complexity. Results showed that both LiDAR and HSI data used alone provided relatively high accurate models if adequate metrics and algorithms are chosen (RMSE = 67.6 Mg.ha−1, RMSE% = 36%, R2 = 0.58, for the best LiDAR model; RMSE = 68.1 Mg.ha−1, RMSE% = 36%, R2 = 0.58, for the best HSI model). However, HSI-only models required more metrics (5–12) than LiDAR-only models (2–5). Models combining metrics from both datasets resulted in more accurate AGB estimates, regardless of the regression method (RMSE = 57.7 Mg.ha−1, RMSE% = 31%, R2 = 0.70, for the best model). The most important LiDAR metrics for estimating AGB were related to the upper canopy cover and tree height percentiles, while the most important HSI metrics were associated with the near infrared and shortwave infrared spectral regions, particularly the leaf/canopy water and lignin-cellulose absorption bands. Finally, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed that the remote sensing data source (LiDAR, HSI, or their combination) had a greater effect size than the regression algorithms. Thus, no single algorithm outperformed the others, although the LM method was less suitable when applied to the HSI and hybrid datasets. Results show that the synergistic use of LiDAR and hyperspectral data has great potential for improving the accuracy of the biomass estimates in the Brazilian Amazon. © 2019 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon stock; Data integration; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Laser scanning; Tropical forest","Analysis of variance (ANOVA); Biomass; Climate change; Data integration; Decision trees; Forestry; Hyperspectral imaging; Infrared devices; Lithium compounds; Regression analysis; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Water absorption; Carbon stocks; Hyperspectral remote sensing; Laser scanning; Light detection and ranging; Recursive feature elimination; Stochastic gradient boosting; Support vector regression (SVR); Tropical forest; Optical radar; aboveground biomass; algorithm; data assimilation; laser method; lidar; modeling; remote sensing; spectral analysis; tropical forest; variance analysis; Biomass; Forestry; Lithium Compounds; Regression Analysis; Remote Sensing; Spectroscopy; Amazonia; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070213201

Conservation studies often examine the impacts of climate change on heritage sites by assuming it as an isolated and static concept. This study aims to debate cultural heritage concept as the primary and neglected factor for wise development of climate-resilience policies. We first adopt the qualitative Meta-synthesis method to analyze the impacts of climate change on world heritage sites, through a systematic review of reports published by the UNESCO and its advisory bodies. Then, it is explained why the sustainability of cultural heritage requires a fundamental reconsideration of the concept and promotion of its evaluation framework. The findings suggest that protection of cultural heritage and developing the climate-resilience policies for the sustainability of landscape requires at the early stages a reflection on how heritage is defined as a useful resource and acceptable characteristic of territory. © 2019 by the authors.","Climate change; Climate resilience; Conservation; Cultural heritage; Protection; Sustainability; Territorial planning","climate change; cultural heritage; heritage conservation; policy development; sustainability; territorial planning; UNESCO; World Heritage Site",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073602746

To help understand the behaviour of this complex system, and evaluate climate model simulations, researchers typically take a reductionist approach, focusing on individual climate processes and studying their relationships with weather and climate in different regions. While more holistic approaches, such as climate networks, have been developed to explicitly address the complexity of the climate, here we argue for the use of a new approach that accounts for multiple cross-scale process interactions, framed with respect to specific climate outcomes of societal importance. We introduce and explore the concept of “climate process chains” (CPCs), describing their potential application using examples determined for southern Africa. Building on related theoretical concepts, and through reviewing literature on climate processes and teleconnections to southern Africa, we identify candidate CPCs for two outcomes of societal interest; a regional-scale drought and local-scale heavy rainfall. Focusing on such outcomes means that CPC investigations have more relevance to climate risk management contexts, as well as providing a constraint on the exploration of climate uncertainties for a region. We argue that CPCs may help to articulate relationships amongst regionally relevant climate processes across temporal and spatial scales, and discuss their potential utility in climate research, including in the evaluation of climate models and their simulations. © 2019 The Authors.

In order to manage the mangrove forests in SEA, their total biomass needs to be determined. However, development of a biomass dataset based on field survey is time consuming. An aboveground biomass (AGB) dataset of mangrove forests was developed for SEA based on ALOS PALSAR 25-m mosaic. Specifically, ALOS-PALSAR 25-m images were first retrieved for SEA from the Kyoto and Carbon Initiative projects and then converted from a digital number to a normalized radar cross-section format in decibels. Samples of mangrove forests in SEA were collected as regions of interest from ALOS PALSAR data based on visual interpretation using Landsat data and Google Earth imagery. A rule-based classification method based on mangrove backscattering characteristics was then used to classify mangroves and nonmangroves in the region. Subsequently, an empirical model was adopted to estimate the AGB of the mangrove forests and an AGB dataset was developed. The results indicate that the spatial distribution of mangrove forests over SEA is 5.1 million hectares, and the estimated average AGB is 140.5 ± 136.1 Mg / ha. © The Authors.

While decision making under risk and uncertainty is the forte of financial economics, important insights from pricing financial assets do not typically inform standard climate–economy models. Here, we introduce EZ-Climate, a simple recursive dynamic asset pricing model that allows for a calibration of the carbon dioxide (CO2) price path based on probabilistic assumptions around climate damages. Atmospheric CO2 is the “asset” with a negative expected return. The economic model focuses on society’s willingness to substitute consumption across time and across uncertain states of nature, enabled by an Epstein–Zin (EZ) specification that delinks preferences over risk from intertemporal substitution. In contrast to most modeled CO2 price paths, EZ-Climate suggests a high price today that is expected to decline over time as the “insurance” value of mitigation declines and technological change makes emissions cuts cheaper. Second, higher risk aversion increases both the CO2 price and the risk premium relative to expected damages. Lastly, our model suggests large costs associated with delays in pricing CO2 emissions. In our base case, delaying implementation by 1 y leads to annual consumption losses of over 2%, a cost that roughly increases with the square of time per additional year of delay.

Nonetheless, the collective response of ecological communities to environmental shifts cannot be predicted from the simple sum of individual species responses, since co-existing species are deeply entangled in interaction networks, such as food webs. For these reasons, the relation between environmental forcing and the structure of food webs is an open problem in ecology. To this respect, one of the main problems in community ecology is defining the role each species plays in shaping community structure, such as by promoting the subdivision of food webs in modules—that is, aggregates composed of species that more frequently interact—which are reported as community stabilizers. In this study, we investigated the relationship between species roles and network modularity under environmental shifts in a highly resolved food web, that is, a “weighted” ecological network reproducing carbon flows among marine planktonic species. Measuring network properties and estimating weighted modularity, we show that species have distinct roles, which differentially affect modularity and mediate structural modifications, such as modules reconfiguration, induced by environmental shifts. Specifically, short-term environmental changes impact the abundance of planktonic primary producers; this affects their consumers’ behavior and cascades into the overall rearrangement of trophic links. Food web re-adjustments are both direct, through the rewiring of trophic-interaction networks, and indirect, with the reconfiguration of trophic cascades. Through such “systemic behavior,” that is, the way the food web acts as a whole, defined by the interactions among its parts, the planktonic food web undergoes a substantial rewiring while keeping almost the same global flow to upper trophic levels, and energetic hierarchy is maintained despite environmental shifts. This behavior suggests the potentially high resilience of plankton networks, such as food webs, to dramatic environmental changes, such as those provoked by global change. © 2019 The Authors.

Only most obvious of these are phenomena under the label of climate change and the reduction of biodiversity in the sixth planetary extinction event. While environmental discourse has largely been about protecting a supposedly fairly stable external context from the depredations of ""development, ""the Anthropocene suggests much more clearly that the rich and powerful parts of humanity are reshaping the planetary system in processes that are about production much more than environmental protection. Holocene biomes have been so thoroughly changed that terrestrial biota and the human systems they support are being reconfigured in novel anthrome geographies in an increasingly artificial biosphere. This reassembling of living and artificial components is making the future Anthropocene one shaped by political decisions about investment, infrastructure and new forms of urban life and rural resource extraction. Whether this is a relatively benign future for most of humanity, or a violent one involving forcible control by the rich and powerful over the remains of a rapidly degrading biosphere and its peoples, is now the overarching question of geological politics. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

This study focuses on a serine peptidase isolated from Aureobasidium leucospermi LB86. The purified enzyme was able to clot milk and, in storage assays, it maintained 90% of its activity for 40 days at 4 °C, and around 66% activity for 210 days. It had an estimated molecular mass of 33 kDa, highest activity at pH 7.0 and 45 °C, was stable in the pH range 5.5–9.0 at 4 °C and 25 °C, exhibiting activity higher than 75%, and retained 90% of activity at temperatures up to 45 °C for 120 min.

Examples of work conducted by the author and colleagues in New York City to quantify the performance of urban GI are first summarized. This work includes monitoring efforts to understand how extensive green roofs retain rainfall, reduce surface temperatures, and sequester carbon. Next, a discussion of the advantages that a distributed, or neighborhood-level, GI system might bring to a climate adaptation strategy is provided.

However, due to a lack of data, energy consumption and emission statistics are not well documented. Focusing on the industrial production using fossil fuels, our work provides the first detailed city-level estimation of production-based sectoral CO2 emissions in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region. In 2010, 15 cities in Xinjiang emitted a total of 304.06 million tonnes CO2, and 97.7% of those emissions were related to fossil fuel combustion (i.e. energy-related emissions), with the remaining 2.3% from industrial processes associated with the production of cement (i.e. process-related emissions). The consumption of raw coal and crude oil were the main sources of Xinjiang's emissions (50.3% and 23.0%, respectively), whereas ‘petroleum processing and coking’ and ‘power and heat production’ were the two sectors that contributed the largest emissions at 32.6% and 27.9%, respectively. The cities in Xinjiang presented considerable variations in the total CO2 emissions and emissions per capita. The emissions intensity and emissions per capita shared similar distributions, and the emissions are significantly spatial autocorrelated. Cities whose economies relied on emission-intensive pillar industries and/or energy mainly sourced from raw coal tended to have high emissions per capita and high emissions intensities. Those cities included Altay, Changji, Hami and Shihezi. We also examined the time-series emissions of Urumqi, the largest city, from 2005 to 2015. Urumqi presented a generally rising trend in CO2 emissions over the decade, with emissions increasing by 324.2%. The major driving sector was ‘power and heat’, which showed increases in the total CO2 emissions and percentage of Xinjiang's emissions. Based on the findings, policy recommendations for emission reductions and low-carbon development for the cities in Xinjiang are provided, including adjusting the energy structure and introducing multiple industries. © 2019 The Authors","Cities; CO2 emissions; Energy consumption; Estimation; Xinjiang","Carbon dioxide; Cement industry; Coal combustion; Coking; Crude oil; Emission control; Energy utilization; Estimation; Fuels; Cities; CO2 emissions; Energy-related emissions; Fossil fuel combustion; Low-carbon development; Policy recommendations; Xinjiang; Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region; Coal industry; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; combustion; crude oil; emission control; estimation method; fossil fuel; industrial production; pollution policy; urban area; urban pollution; China; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067601108

While this has been a very successful strategy for safeguarding human health and protecting aquatic ecosystems, the conversion of ammonium into its elemental form is incompatible with the developing circular economy of the 21st century. Equally important, the activated sludge process and other emerging ammonium removal pathways have several environmental and technological limitations. Here, we assess that the theoretical energy embedded in ammonium in domestic wastewater represents roughly 38-48% of the embedded chemical energy available in the whole of the discharged bodily waste. The current routes for ammonium removal not only neglect the energy embedded in ammonium, but they can also produce N2O, a very strong greenhouse gas, with such emissions comprising the equivalent of 14-26% of the overall carbon footprint of wastewater treatment plants. N2O emissions often exceed the carbon emissions related to the electricity consumption for the process requirements of WWTPs. Considering these limitations, there is a need to develop alternative ammonium management approaches that center around recovery of ammonium from domestic wastewater rather than deal with its ""destruction"" into elemental dinitrogen. Current ammonium recovery techniques are applicable only at orders of magnitude above domestic wastewater strength, and so new techniques based on physicochemical adsorption are of particular interest. A new pathway is proposed that allows for mainstream ammonium recovery from wastewater based on physicochemical adsorption through development of polymer-based adsorbents. Provided adequate adsorbents corresponding to characteristics outlined in this paper are designed and brought to industrial production, this adsorption-based approach opens perspectives for mainstream continuous adsorption coupled with side-stream recovery of ammonium with minimal chemical requirements. This proposed pathway can bring forward an effective resource-oriented approach to upgrade the fate of ammonium in urban water management without generating hidden externalized environmental costs. © 2019 American Chemical Society.",,"Adsorption; Aquatic ecosystems; Biological water treatment; Carbon footprint; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Greenhouse gases; Recovery; Wastewater treatment; Conventional activated sludges; Electricity-consumption; Industrial production; Municipal wastewater treatment; Physico-chemical adsorption; Technological limitations; Urban water management; Wastewater treatment plants; Activated sludge process; ammonia; ammonium derivative; activated sludge; ammonium; carbon footprint; pollutant removal; recovery; sustainability; twentieth century; wastewater treatment; activated sludge; adsorption; anaerobic ammonium oxidation; carbon footprint; greenhouse gas; industrial production; physical chemistry; Review; waste component removal; waste water; waste water management; ecosystem; sewage; waste water; Ammonium Compounds; Ecosystem; Sewage; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072790527

Although the public recognizes the dangers of climate change, and is deluged with lists of possible mitigative actions, little is known about public efficacy beliefs in the context of climate change. Prior efficacy studies rely on conflicting constructs and measures of efficacy, and links between efficacy and risk management actions are muddled. As a result, much remains to learn about how laypersons think about the ease and effectiveness of potential mitigative actions. To bring clarity and inform risk communication and management efforts, we investigate how people think about efficacy in the context of climate change risk management by analyzing unprompted and prompted beliefs from two national surveys (N = 405, N = 1,820). In general, respondents distinguish little between effective and ineffective climate strategies. While many respondents appreciate that reducing fossil fuel use is an effective risk mitigation strategy, overall assessments reflect persistent misconceptions about climate change causes, and uncertainties about the effectiveness of risk mitigation strategies. Our findings suggest targeting climate change risk communication and management strategies to (1) address gaps in people's existing mental models of climate action, (2) leverage existing public understanding of both potentially effective mitigation strategies and the collective action dilemma at the heart of climate change action, and (3) take into account ideologically driven reactions to behavior change and government action framed as climate action. © 2019 Society for Risk Analysis","Climate change; efficacy; risk communication","Behavioral research; Climate models; Fossil fuels; Information theory; Risk assessment; Risk management; Climate change risks; efficacy; Government actions; Management strategies; Mitigation strategy; Public understanding; Risk communication; Risk mitigation strategy; Climate change; action plan; climate change; collective action; communication; government; management practice; mitigation; psychology; risk assessment; strategic approach; uncertainty analysis; attitude; climate change; human; questionnaire; risk assessment; United States; Attitude; Climate Change; Humans; Risk Assessment; Surveys and Questionnaires; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070067062

Climate change is anticipated to exacerbate land degradation in the rangelands, through increased incidence of drought. In the semi-arid rangelands of Australia, land managers have limited capacity to manage land degradation. Recent Australian climate policy initiatives could provide opportunities to improve land management, and increase resilience of rangeland pastoral systems. The Australian government's Emissions Reduction Fund enables landholders to obtain carbon credits for sequestering carbon in vegetation and soil. In western New South Wales (NSW), landholders have received funding for avoiding clearing or allowing the regrowth of native vegetation. These carbon farming projects could provide financial resources for landholders to manage drivers of land degradation and thus contribute to achieving “land degradation neutrality” (LDN). However, the impacts of carbon farming, particularly at regional level, are highly uncertain. The conceptual framework for LDN proposes that planning for LDN should be underpinned by assessment of resilience of the current and alternative lands use, using tools such as the Resilience Adaptation Pathways and Transformation Approach (RAPTA). RAPTA is a framework developed to guide the application of resilience concepts in management of social-ecological systems. It encourages a systems approach to identify critical linkages in the system, that become the focus of assessment of the system's resilience, and development of management plans to enhance resilience, and facilitate transformation where required. We present a case study of the application of RAPTA to support assessment of the resilience of current management and alternative land use strategies involving carbon farming. RAPTA facilitated a holistic assessment of social, biophysical and economic impacts of carbon farming in western NSW, that improved understanding of the opportunities, trade-offs, synergies and risks. RAPTA was found to be an effective tool to support LDN planning. Constraints to application of RAPTA include gaps in knowledge of thresholds, and resource requirements to enable effective stakeholder engagement, to inform integrated landscape management. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon farming; INS; Invasive native species; RAPTA; Resilience adaptation pathways and transformation approach","carbon; tenidap; agricultural worker; Article; Australia; conceptual framework; degradation; grazing; land use; landscape; priority journal; rangeland; season; soil; stakeholder engagement; vegetation; wind erosion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067306888

This study focused on improving the understanding of the BHFS performance by investigating its characteristics and potential failure modes. BHFS operation was split into three modes: catalytic oxidation (CO), thermal conductivity (TC) and a transition region. Good linear performance was observed in CO and TC modes (R2 &gt; 0.992), however, the calibration factor changed between experiments highlighting the importance of regular calibration. Measurements in the middle region were dominated by noise with poor linearity. Instrument failure due to high non-methane hydrocarbons occurred sometimes; a hypothesis to explain this has been established.

A suite of 3D global climate model simulations is performed for low and high obliquity planets with various stellar fluxes, CO2 concentrations, and initial conditions to explore the propensity for high obliquity climates to undergo global glaciation. We also simulate planets with thick CO2 or H2 atmospheres, such as those expected to develop near or beyond the outer edge of the habitable zone. We show that high obliquity planets are hotter than their low obliquity counterparts due to ice-albedo feedbacks for cold climates, and water vapor in warm climates. We suggest that the water vapor greenhouse trapping is greater on high obliquity bodies for a given global-mean temperature due to the different dynamical regimes that occur between the two states. While equatorial ice belts are stable at high obliquity in some climate regimes, it is substantially harder to achieve global glaciation than for a low obliquity planet. Temperate polar conditions can be present at high obliquity at forcings for which low obliquity planets would be in a hard snowball state. Furthermore, open ocean can persist even in the winter hemisphere and when global-mean temperatures are well below freezing. However, the influence of obliquity diminishes for dense atmospheres, in agreement with calculations from 1D energy balance models. © 2019. The American Astronomical Society.

The results show that for most of the analyzed countries, context-based climate policies for slums are not part of the strategies presented in the NDCs. We argue that a lack of policies involving informal settlements might limit the capacity of developing countries to contribute to the main goals of the Paris Agreement, as these settlements are significant portions of their urban populations. One of the hopeful prospects of the NDCs is that they will be reviewed in 2020 for the 26th Conference of the Parties (COP26).

This paper presents a novel integrated electricity-heat-gas transmission network model that considers electrical and gas network flows coupled with the fuel requirements for the heating sector. The latter is modelled at a nodal network level and on a half-hourly basis, building upon the high-resolution temporal and spatial heat demand model presented in Part I. In particular, here the modelling is developed further to include an integrated heat-electricity-gas optimization to assess the operation of different heating technologies, and particularly hybrid ones. More specifically, DC power flow modelling is coupled with steady-state gas network energy and transportation cost optimization to assess gas-electricity price interactions, and with transient gas flow modelling for gas network operational studies. Numerical case studies are performed on the GB energy system, considering the evolution towards a low carbon future, the operation of hybrid dual-fuel electric heat pump/gas boiler technologies, and the ability to alleviate gas network constraints. Resilience case studies considering nodal gas price implications under gas network supply shocks are also considered. The results show how pathways to electrify heating and decarbonise the power sector can lead to a 75% reduction in carbon emissions of the heat and electricity sectors and that using hybrid heating technologies can reduce conventional generation peaks by 24%. Additionally, it is shown that exploiting gas demand response can provide an additional resilience option to the gas network. © 2018","Gas demand response; Gas networks; Hybrid heating technologies; Integrated energy systems; Multi-energy systems; Network resilience","Carbon; Costs; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Flow of gases; Gas industry; Heating; Gas demands; Gas networks; Heating technology; Integrated energy systems; Multi-energy systems; Network resilience; Gases; demand analysis; electricity; environmental assessment; flow modeling; gas flow; integrated approach; network analysis; numerical model; operations technology; optimization; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85042607111

These islands experience a range of conditions in terms of physical and biological habitat, creating a natural laboratory to investigate local genetic adaptation. One striking habitat difference is in the availability of Euphausia superba krill as prey, which has led to A. gazella exhibiting a range of diets. A. gazella in some colonies consume exclusively krill, while their conspecifics in other colonies feed mainly on fish and consume few to no krill. To investigate potential adaptations to these different prey fields, reduced representation genome sequencing was conducted on A. gazella from the 8 major colonies. Twenty-seven genomic regions exhibiting signatures of natural selection were identified. Two of these genomic regions were clearly associated with seals living in krill-dominated areas or those in fish-dominated areas. Twenty-two additional genomic regions under selection showed a pattern consistent with prey differences as the driver of selection after historical migrations from krill-dominated habitats where lineages evolved to present krill-poor habitat areas were taken into account. Only 1 of the genomic regions identified appeared to be explained by any other environmental variable analysed (depth). Genomic regions under prey-driven selection included genes associated with regulation of gene expression, skeletal development, and lipid metabolism. Adaptation to local prey has implications for spatial management of this species and for the potential impacts of climate- or harvest-driven reductions in krill abundance on these seals. © Inter-Research and The Crown 2019","Arctocephalus gazella; DdRAD; Diet; Double digest restriction-site associated DNA sequencing; Euphausia superba; Natural selection","conspecific; diet; DNA; genetic analysis; genomics; habitat availability; local adaptation; natural selection; pinniped; prey availability; Antarctic Peninsula; Antarctica; West Antarctica; Arctocephalus gazella; Euphausia superba; Euphausiacea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073811603

Competing objectives from a variety of stakeholders relating to occupant wellbeing, fuel poverty alleviation, improved air quality, low energy use, emissions reduction, and legislative compliance then act to confound the attainment of operational quality and resilience of particular design solutions. This gives rise to a persistent and growing gap between design intent (in both new build and retrofit contexts) and the operational reality. Unfortunately, there are no current standards for building performance appraisal and operational resilience testing so that such assessments, where undertaken, are ad hoc and implemented as an arbitrary function of the particular project context. The result is that it is impossible to compare alternative proposals in terms of the performance that is likely to be delivered in practice.

Although the majority of fisheries in the world are managed at the national or local scale, most existing approaches to assessing climate impacts on fisheries have been developed on a global scale. It is often difficult to translate from the global to regional and local settings because of limited relevant data. To address the need for fisheries management entities to identify those fisheries with the greatest potential for climate change impacts, we present an approach for estimating expected climate change-driven impacts on the productivity and spatial range of fisheries at the regional scale in a data-poor context. We use a set of representative Mexican fisheries as test cases. To assess the implications of climate impacts, we compare biomass, harvest, and profit outcomes from a bioeconomic model under contrasting management policies and with and without climate change. Overall results show that climate change is estimated to negatively affect nearly every fishery in our study. However, the results indicate that overfishing is a greater threat than climate change for these fisheries, hence fixing current management challenges has a greater upside than the projected future costs of moderate levels of climate change. Additionally, this study provides meaningful first approximations of potential effects of both climate change and management reform in Mexican fisheries. Using the climate impact estimations and model outputs, we identify high priority stocks, fleets, and regions for policy reform in Mexico in the face of climate change. This approach can be applied in other data-poor circumstances to focus future research and policy reform efforts on stocks now subject to additional stress due to climate change. Considering their growing relevance as a critical source of protein and micronutrients to nourish our growing population, it is urgent for regions to develop sound fishery management policies in the short-term as they are the most important intervention to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change on marine fisheries. © 2019 Cisneros-Mata et al.

The current-voltage (I–V) characteristics of SJSs operating in their forward and reverse regions operating at ±3 V were measured at room temperature (295 K). The electronics parameters such as the series resistance (Rs), the shunt resistance (Rsh), the ideality factor (n) and the barrier height (ΦB0) were calculated by using thermionic emission (TE) theory, Ohm's law, Cheung and Cheung's function and modified Norde's function. Labview® based characterization tool developed to calculate the electronic parameters. The results were compared according to the various thicknesses and different rectifier contacts. Experimentally, if the results are analysed for each group, a (gradual) decrease in ZnO thicknesses is caused by an increase in the values of n, ФB0, RR. In addition, the Rsh values were significantly increased while the Rs values were almost close to each other. As the ΦB0 values, while compatible with the values found in the Cheung and Cheung's function, they are slightly higher than the values found in the TE theory. On the other hand, due to the voltage-dependent barrier height and nature of the used method, ФB0 values from modified Norde's function are a little higher than the TE theory. Finally, it can be clearly seen that electronic parameters of SJSs based on sensor applications can be arranged with various thicknesses according to extracted results. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","A nano-structures; A.

Large uncertainties still exist for previous studies which tried to simulate carbon emissions in spatial, and the resolution needs to be improved to a large extent. At a city level, this study collected various sources of big data and designed a new methodology to examine carbon emissions in Nanjing city at a high resolution of 300 m. In addition, regional differences were compared, and influence factors were analyzed. This study found, the core urban area in Nanjing presented an obvious intensity variation, but the emission intensities were much lower than in those from the peripheral region where industrial land was mainly distributed. Broad areas away from urban areas, where cropland and rural residential land were distributed, presented low carbon emission intensities. Regionally, the districts in the core urban area always presented high emission intensities. The characteristics of land usage and social-economic development were key factors in determining carbon emissions. An increase in ecological land and a decrease in developed land will help carbon reduction strategies greatly. For social and economic development, adjustments in the structure of industry and energy use efficiency improvements will play key roles in the reduction of carbon emissions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Big data; Carbon emissions; City; High resolution; Land use; Spatial distribution","Big data; Economic and social effects; Energy utilization; Industrial economics; Industrial emissions; Land use; Spatial distribution; Carbon emissions; City; Energy-use efficiency; High emission intensity; High resolution; Regional differences; Social and economic development; Spatial heterogeneity analysis; Carbon; carbon; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; computer simulation; emission control; energy efficiency; heterogeneity; numerical model; pollution control; spatial analysis; urban pollution; Article; carbon footprint; China; cropland; data processing; economic development; geographic distribution; land use; priority journal; rural area; simulation; socioeconomics; spatial analysis; urban area; China; Jiangsu; Nanjing [Jiangsu]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066949212

The issue of energy efficiency and climate chance resonates in energy sector as one of the main producer of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. While the Union as a whole is doing well in reducing emissions as well as in increasing the share of renewables, unfortunately, there are countries still far from their goal. The aim of this paper is to quantitatively assess the relationship between economic growth of energy sector and production of GHG emissions by energy sector in the V4 countries using decoupling method. The paper focuses on the case of V4 countries in the period of 1995 - 2016. Throughout the more than 20 years examined, the countries spread out into many different forms of decoupling. The results of analysis suggest that in most observed partial variables occurs the strong decoupling of economic growth of energy sector (measured in GVA) and GHG emissions produced by energy sector, what can be considered as positive trend. Findings of the paper are relevant for government, state and public institutions as well as stakeholders in general who play important role in preparation of programs, projects and initiatives to make energy appliances, buildings, transport and energy generation more efficient, and introduces stringent new energy efficiency standards and financing mechanisms to support more energy efficient products. © 2019 IEEE",,"Air quality; Economic analysis; Energy policy; Engineering education; Environmental protection; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Decoupling analysis; Decoupling methods; Energy generations; Energy-efficient products; Environmental pressures; Financing mechanisms; Public institution; Reducing emissions; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079539293

Here, we tested experimentally how soil food web trophic complexity modulates the response to drought of soil functions related to carbon cycling and the capture and transfer below-ground of recent photosynthate by plants. We constructed experimental systems comprising soil communities with one, two or three trophic levels (microorganisms, detritivores and predators) and subjected them to drought. We investigated how food web trophic complexity in interaction with drought influenced litter decomposition, soil CO2 efflux, mycorrhizal colonization, fungal production, microbial communities and soil fauna biomass. Plants were pulse-labelled after the drought with 13C-CO2 to quantify the capture of recent photosynthate and its transfer below-ground. Overall, our results show that drought and soil food web trophic complexity do not interact to affect soil functions and microbial community composition, but act independently, with an overall stronger effect of drought. After drought, the net uptake of 13C by plants was reduced and its retention in plant biomass was greater, leading to a strong decrease in carbon transfer below-ground. Although food web trophic complexity influenced the biomass of Collembola and fungal hyphal length, 13C enrichment and the net transfer of carbon from plant shoots to microbes and soil CO2 efflux were not affected significantly by varying the number of trophic groups. Our results indicate that drought has a strong effect on above-ground–below-ground linkages by reducing the flow of recent photosynthate. Our results emphasize the sensitivity of the critical pathway of recent photosynthate transfer from plants to soil organisms to a drought perturbation, and show that these effects may not be mitigated by the trophic complexity of soil communities, at least at the level manipulated in this experiment. © 2019 The Authors.

Air quality models have been used as an essential tool to predict spatial and temporal distribution of the PM2.5 and to support relevant policy making. This study aims to investigate the performance of high-fidelity air quality models in simulating surface PM2.5 chemical composition over the East Asia region in terms of a prediction consistency, which is a prerequisite for accurate air quality forecasts and reliable policy decision. The WRF-Chem (Weather Research and Forecasting-Chemistry) and WRF/CMAQ (Weather Research and Forecasting/Community Multiscale Air Quality modeling system) models were selected and uniquely configured for a one-month simulation by controlling surface emissions and meteorological processes (model options) to investigate the prediction consistency focusing the analyses on the effects of meteorological and chemical processes. The results showed that the surface PM2.5 chemical components simulated by both the models had significant inconsistencies over East Asia ranging fractional differences of 53% ± 30% despite the differences in emissions and meteorological fields were minimal. The models' large inconsistencies in the surface PM2.5 concentration were attributed to the significant differences in each model's chemical responses to the meteorological variables, which were identified from the multiple linear regression analyses. Our findings suggest that the significant models' prediction inconsistencies should be considered with a great caution in the PM2.5 forecasts and policy support over the East Asian region. © 2019 by the authors.","Air quality forecast; Air quality model; CMAQ; East Asia; PM2.5; WRF-Chem","Air quality; Chemical analysis; Decision making; Linear regression; Air quality forecasts; Air quality modeling; CMAQ; East Asia; PM2.5; WRF-Chem; Weather forecasting; air quality; chemical composition; climate modeling; climate prediction; comparative study; particulate matter; policy analysis; weather forecasting; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074073901

To remediate the impact of air pollution, urban greening has been increasingly explored as a possible way to remove PM from the surroundings. However, existing research focuses mainly on species-specific assessments within temperate climates that may not necessarily grow outside of their local regions. To address sampling limitations associated with the great species diversity in the tropics, our study quantified three key functional traits—leaf hairiness, average leaf area (ALA) and specific leaf area (SLA)—each spanning a wide range of values across 20 tropical species. Wind-tunnel experiments were used to assess surface deposition velocity on leaves; the size fractions PM10 and PM2.5 were measured through multiple rounds of filtration and gravimetric analysis. The effects of upper- and lower-surfaces of leaves on deposition velocity and their interactions with hairiness were also investigated. Results show that greater upper-surface hairiness and a low SLA were consistent predictors of higher deposition velocity for both PM-size fractions. Hairs on leaves serve as obstacles while low SLA tends to be associated with smaller and thicker leaves, together favoring the deposition and retention of PM. The possible mechanisms behind important plant traits and their interactions are discussed.

For Study 1, to capture epistemic cognition, epistemic emotions, and self-regulatory strategies, 114 undergraduate students thought out loud while reading conflicting texts about climate change. Protocol analysis revealed that epistemic aims, epistemic congruity, and appraisals of novelty and complexity of information served as antecedents to epistemic emotions. State-transition analyses revealed that curiosity increased the likelihood of metacognitive self-regulation, and that surprise decreased the likelihood of rehearsal and increased the likelihood of critical thinking. For Study 2, participants reported epistemic beliefs, read contradictory texts about climate change, reported emotions experienced while reading, and completed a knowledge assessment task. Path analyses revealed full mediation between epistemic beliefs, epistemic emotions, learning strategies and learning achievement. More constructivist beliefs about the complexity, uncertainty and justification of knowledge predicted more curiosity, less surprise, and less boredom. Curiosity, in turn, predicted critical thinking, knowledge elaboration and rehearsal strategies. Finally, critical thinking and rehearsal positively predicted learning achievement.

Because China's air pollution, especially PM2.5 pollution, is so serious that it forms an urgent policy issue affecting China's sustainable economic growth, this topic is important. However, few efforts have been made to explore the cost, potential and optimal plan of reducing emissions to control PM2.5 in China. To apply a parametric non-radial directional distance shadow price approach, panel data from 73 key monitoring cities in China from 2004 to 2016 are used to measure the PM2.5 environmental efficiency and marginal abatement cost. The results show that PM2.5 pollution in China presents regional and spatial correlations. The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region has more severe haze pollution than the Yangtze River Delta and the Pearl River Delta, resulting in the largest potential for emission reduction and the lowest marginal reduction cost. Overall, the average PM2.5 reduction potential for all cities is 42.6% without considering external sources and 40.4% when considering external sources. The average abatement cost of PM2.5 reaches 0.6308 billion yuan/μg·m3 when excluding external sources; when considering external sources, the average reduction cost in PM2.5 is 0.6378 billion yuan/μg·m3. Policymakers must be notified that PM2.5 pollution and other air emissions, such as CO2 and SO2 emissions, are very different from each other. PM2.5 pollution is spatially diffusive and exhibits regional heterogeneity. Therefore, policymakers must implement different policies in different cities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Marginal abatement cost; Parameterized non-radial directional distance function; PM2.5 pollution environmental efficiency; Shadow price","Air pollution; Cost reduction; Economics; Efficiency; Emission control; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Directional distance function; Directional distances; Environmental efficiency; Marginal abatement costs; Shadow price; Spatial correlations; Sustainable economic growth; River pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068211632

With ground observation and remotely sensed data, the variation of ground ozone concentrations at an urban AT (Aoti) station and a rural YF (Yufa) station in Beijing was examined and a notable upward trend of ozone concentrations at both stations was found from 2006 to 2017. Following this, through a statistical model, the relative contribution of meteorological conditions to long-term ozone variations at both stations was calculated as 2%–3%, indicating anthropogenic emissions were the major cause for long-term ozone variations in Beijing. Meanwhile, short-term ozone variations could be influenced significantly by seasonal and synoptic meteorological conditions. Furthermore, the long-term variations of ozone formation regimes across Beijing were analyzed using OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) retrieved HCHO VCDs (Vertical Column Densities)/NO2 VCDs, which were strongly correlated with ozone concentrations. The results suggested that the ozone formation regime for the AT urban station and YF rural station had changed from VOCs-limited and NOx-limited to VOCs-NOx-limited respectively. In this case, NOx-oriented emission-reduction measures for reducing PM2.5 concentrations might conversely enhance ozone concentrations in Beijing. Given the increasingly heterogeneous distribution of different ozone formation regimes across Beijing, emission-reduction strategies that balanced consider the reduction of VOCs and NOx emissions should be better designed and implemented according to local ozone formation regimes. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Beijing; Emission-reduction; Meteorological influences; Ozone; Regime","Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Beijing; Emission reduction; Emission reduction strategy; Heterogeneous distributions; Long term ozone variations; Meteorological influence; Ozone monitoring instruments; Regime; Ultraviolet spectrometers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068149891

However, how environmental factors-especially the temperature and precipitation pattern-impact Tc has been less discussed for forest stands. In this study, we investigated seasonal variations and responses of the Tc and canopy-to-air temperature difference (ΔT) associated with environmental conditions in two subtropical forests with contrasting temperature and precipitation patterns-Dinghushan (DHS) (temperature and precipitation synchronous site: hot and wet in the summer) and Qianyanzhou (QYZ) (temperature and precipitation asynchronous site: hot and arid in the summer). The results showed that Tc exhibits clear diurnal and seasonal variations above air temperature throughout the day and year, suggesting that the canopy of both DHS and QYZ is typically warmer than ambient air. However, the canopy-warming effect was substantially intensified in QYZ, and the difference of ΔT between dry and wet seasons was small (-00.07 °C) in DHS, while it was up to 0.9 °C in QYZ. Regression analysis revealed that this resulted from the combined effects of the increased solar radiation and vapor pressure deficit (VPD), but reduced canopy conductance (gc) caused by drought in the summer in QYZ. Sensitivity analysis further indicated that the responses of ΔT to VPD and gc changes were quite divergent, presenting negative responses to the enhanced VPD and gc in QYZ, while there were positive responses in DHS. The high productivity coupled with low transpiration cooling that occurs in a temperature and precipitation synchronous condition mainly contributes to the positive responses of ΔT in DHS. This study reveals the seasonal variations, environmental responses, and underlying causes of Tc under different temperature and precipitation patterns, providing useful information for the regional assessment of plant responses to future climate change. © 2019 by the authors.","Canopy temperature; Environmental sensitivity; Seasonal drought; Seasonal variation; Temperature and precipitation asynchronous","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Drought; Forestry; Radiation effects; Regression analysis; Tropics; Canopy temperature; Environmental conditions; Environmental response; Environmental sensitivities; Precipitation patterns; Seasonal droughts; Seasonal variation; Vapor pressure deficit; Sensitivity analysis; air temperature; canopy; climate change; drought; environmental change; environmental factor; precipitation (climatology); seasonal variation; tree; Drought; Forestry; Radiation Effects; Regression Analysis; Temperature; Tropics; Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073467878

This paper describes a case study on the large deformation mechanism and supporting method of the Maoxian tunnel in Sichuan Province, China, which is located in the core area influenced by the 2008 Wenchuan earthquake and suffered severe large deformation in broken phyllite under high geo-stress. Through a survey on the geological features, the deformation mechanism of surrounding rock and the failure characteristics of supporting structures of the Maoxian tunnel in F1 fault zone were studied. It was found that the occurrence of large deformation was due to the combined action of the high geo-stress and poor self-stability of carbonaceous phyllite. In order to control the squeezing deformation, single and double primary support methods were adopted in succession. A comparative field test was conducted to study their supporting mechanism and mechanical behavior in terms of surrounding rock pressure, internal stress of the steel arch, and axial force and bending moment of the secondary lining. The results revealed that the single primary support method cannot ensure the long-term safety of the tunnel, since many cracks in concrete occurred after about 180 days. The double primary support method, however, was able to control the large deformation and rheological effects of broken phyllite under high geo-stress effectively. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Broken phyllite; High geo-stress; Large deformation; Maoxian tunnel; Supporting method","Earthquakes; Rocks; Supports; 2008 wenchuan earthquakes; Deformation mechanism; Failure characteristics; Geo-stress; Phyllite; Supporting mechanisms; Supporting method; Surrounding rock pressure; Deformation; deformation mechanism; failure analysis; mechanical property; phyllite; stress; support structure; tunnel lining; China; Maoxian; Sichuan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072981084

The empirical results show obvious non-linear effects of environmental regulation and industrial structure on carbon dioxide emission. Taking the effects of both linearity and non-linearity into consideration, environmental regulation will reduce carbon emissions with the change of industrial structure rationalization (SR). When the level of industrial structure optimization (SH) is low, environmental regulation promotes carbon dioxide emissions. When the level of industrial structure optimization (SH) is high, environmental regulation plays a significant inhibitive role on carbon dioxide emissions. The Kuznets relationship between GDP per capita (PGDP) and carbon dioxide emissions is influenced by local industrial structure rationalization and industrial structure optimization.

Secondly, the economic benefits of EV charging facilities participating in carbon trading market is analyzed, which shows that participating in carbon trading has economic rationality. Finally, a case study of the carbon emission accounting and economic benefits of EV charging facilities participating in carbon trading is carried out.

MH98A. Here, we provide the genome of Methanoculleus taiwanensis CYW4T isolated from the deep-sea subseafloor sediment at the Deformation Front offshore southwestern Taiwan, where methane hydrate deposits are likely located. Through comparative genomics analyses of nine Methanoculleus strains from various habitats, 2–3 coding genes for trehalose synthases were found in all nine Methanoculleus genomes, which were not detected in other methanogens and are therefore suggested as a signature of genus Methanoculleus among methane-producing archaea. In addition, the structural genes adjacent to trehalose synthase genes are comprised of the signaling module of Per-Arnt-Sim (PAS) domain-containing proteins, Hsp20 family proteins, arabinose efflux permeases and multiple surface proteins with fasciclin-like (FAS) repeat. This indicates that trehalose synthase gene clusters in Methanoculleus might play roles in the response to various stresses and regulate carbon storage and modification of surface proteins through accumulation of trehalose. The non-gas hydrate-associated Methanoculleus strains harbor carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase (cooS/acsA) genes, which are important for the conversion of acetate to methane at the step of CO oxidation/CO2 reduction in acetoclastic methanogens and further implies that these strains may be able to utilize CO for methanogenesis in their natural habitats.

The use of SF6 is being reduced because of its high global warming potential. To describe the physical and chemical processes occurring in the arc plasma in circuit breakers, both local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and nonlocal chemical equilibrium (LCE) conditions have to be considered. The plasma composition of the arc core region can be calculated under the assumption of LTE by the method of minimization of the Gibbs free energy. The plasma composition of the arc boundary region or during the arc ignition period is not in LTE or LCE, so the use of a chemical kinetic model that considers the effects of the energy barrier in chemical reactions is required. Calculations for both conditions are presented for C4F7N. To develop the chemical kinetic model, the complete decomposition pathway and transition states were first reexamined and further developed. Based on the decomposition pathway, the rate constants of reactions were obtained according to the variational transition state theory method. The results obtained for the two cases provide a reference for the systematic understanding of the decomposition characteristics of C4F7N gas and for related engineering applications. © 2019 Author(s).",,"Electric circuit breakers; Electronic states; Free energy; Gibbs free energy; Global warming; Kinetic parameters; Kinetic theory; Rate constants; SF6 insulation; Sulfur hexafluoride; Chemical kinetic model; Decomposition characteristics; Decomposition mechanism; Engineering applications; Global warming potential; High voltage circuit breaker; Local thermodynamic equilibrium; Variational transition state theory; Decomposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074213250

However, the uncertainty of solar radiation brings significant challenges to the renewable heat and electrical system for buildings. Thus, many different solar radiation forecasting methods, such as Numerical Weather Prediction Methods (NWP), Statistical Methods, Top-Down Methods, Bottom-Up Methods and Hybrid Methods have been developed to make the best guess on future solar radiations. Based on the meteorology definition, nowcasting refers to the forecast of the temporal horizon from the next few seconds up to six hours. Predicting solar radiation within this range are extremely challenging, but crucial for solar energy system operation. This paper firstly reviewed the state of art of solar radiation forecasting methods and compared the key features of each method. According to the advantage and costs of each method, this paper then proposed a methodology to generate high accuracy low-cost solar radiation nowcast data for optimising building solar thermal system performance and related control strategies. Note that this paper focused on the scoping study of methodology rather than field experiments, and further research with experiments data will be reported in a journal publication. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

This study was conducted to determine the effect of lactic acid bacteria (LAB) inoculants, either alone or in combination with fibrolytic enzymes on the fermentation quality, and ruminal nutrients degradability, fermentation profile and microbial communities of high-moisture alfalfa silage. Alfalfa (206 g dry matter [DM]/kg fresh matter) was ensiled in laboratory-scale silos with four experimental variants: (a) deionized water (Control); (b) LAB inoculants (Lactobacillus plantarum and Pediococcus pentosaceus combination; I); (c) fibrolytic enzymes (cellulase and hemicellulase enzymes combination; E); (d) a mixture of I and E (IE). All silos were opened after 45 days for determining the silage quality. Further, the four experimental silages were used to measure in vitro rumen degradability, fermentation profile and bacterial populations by fermenting with buffered rumen fluid. The addition of I stimulated a more efficient homofermentation of high-moisture alfalfa silage than in the variants without I, as evidenced by higher lactic-to-acetic acid ratios and lower DM losses, and IE addition further enhanced the homofermentation. Compared to the Control, the addition of E increased the proteolysis, and decreased in vitro degradability of DM (IVDMD) and crude protein of DM (IVCPD) as well as in vitro gas production of 48 hr (GP48). The addition of I reduced the proteolysis and methane production, and increased the IVDMD, IVCPD, GP48, ruminal short-chain fatty acids concentrations and microbial protein production. The populations of Genus Prevotella were higher in silages produced with I, but lower with E than the Control. The data suggested that the addition of LAB inoculants alone or together with fibrolytic enzymes could improve the fermentation quality and nutritive value of high-moisture alfalfa silage. © 2019 Japanese Society of Grassland Science","additives; high-moisture alfalfa silage; methane production; ruminal bacterial populations; ruminal fermentation","additive; alfalfa; bacterium; degradation; enzyme; fermentation; methane; microbial community; silage; Animalia; Bacteria (microorganisms); Lactobacillus plantarum; Medicago sativa; Pediococcus pentosaceus; Prevotella",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064484392

It mediates the induction of many metabolic enzymes of the cytochrome P450 family after engaging with its ligands. Meanwhile, nickel, also an environmental toxicant, induces a hypoxic response, leading to stabilization of HIF-1α. Lysine residues known for posttranslational modifications are important for subcellular localization, stability, and/or activity of gene products. Methods: In this study, we have determined nickel’s suppressive effect on TCDD-induced expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2, two members of the cytochrome P450 super-family. We have also analyzed CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 levels after expression of AhR with various lysine mutations. Results: We have shown that induction of CYP1A1 and CYP1A2 by TCDD and other AhR ligands is significantly suppressed by hypoxia-mimetics including nickel. This effect is likely due to a competition for α-sub-unit shared by AhR and HIF-1 transcription factors. We have also found that substitutions of lysines 14, 17, and 21 with arginines suppress the ability of AhR to transactivate P450 genes after treatment with TCDD. Conclusion: Ligand-mediated AhR activation can be significantly modulated by co-exposure to other environmental toxicant (s) or by its lysine mutations. © 2019, The Korean Society of Toxicogenomics and Toxicoproteomics and Springer Nature B.V.","Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Cytochrome P450; HIF-1α; Lysine; Nickel chloride; Posttranslational modification; TCDD","2,3,7,8 tetrachlorodibenzo para dioxin; alpha tubulin; arginine; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; beta actin; cobalt; cytochrome P450; cytochrome P450 1A1; cytochrome P450 1A2; hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha; hypoxia inducible factor 1beta; lysine; nickel; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase 1; Article; BEAS-2B cell line; enzyme induction; exposure; gene mutation; heavy metal poisoning; HEK293T cell line; Hep-G2 cell line; human; human cell; hypoxia; ligand binding; protein expression; protein processing; transcription regulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073918225

Results show that approximately 2.2% of global energy consumption needs can be met by 2050, with significant contributions in the city gas network and transportation sector. Notably, passenger FCVs dominate the transportation sector contribution, leading to a global deployment of over 100 million FCVs by 2050 across North America, Western Europe, South East Asia, China and Japan. Hydrogen production is focused in non- OECD nations, and derived mainly from fossil fuels. As a result, CCS has a strong role to play in the future energy system in order to underpin the deployment of a significant fleet of FCVs.

In response, airlines have taken measures through various means, including the use of sustainable fuels. This article investigates the potential effects of a CORSIA-type policy when implemented in the United States. The study uses a combined model of airlines operations and multi-feedstock sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) to represent decisions of several actors, such as farmers, bio-refineries, airlines, and policymakers. The research employed a life-cycle assessment and Monte-Carlo simulation to evaluate two policy scenarios on the amount of SAF consumption and the resulting emissions. Implementing a CORSIA-type policy could stimulate the demand and production of SAFs, while also reducing air travel growth by increasing airfare. As a result of this combined effect and improved aircraft technology, there is a 3.5% chance that the U.S. airlines industry can reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 37.5–50% by the year 2050, compared to the 2005 emission levels. Despite a projected increase in air travel in 2050 by a factor of 2.75 (the median value), the emissions in 2050 are expected to rise to only 120% (the median value) of the 2005 level. The price of petroleum-based aviation fuels followed by the growth rate of the carbon price are the two most important factors to determine whether the CORSIA-type policy would achieve the emission reduction target. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Aviation emissions policy; Greenhouse gas emissions; Sustainable aviation fuels; U.S. airlines operations","Air transportation; Artificial life; Carbon; Civil aviation; Emission control; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Intelligent systems; Life cycle; Monte Carlo methods; Aircraft technology; Airlines operations; Aviation fuel; Emission reduction targets; Emissions policies; International aviation; International Civil Aviation Organization; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Greenhouse gases; air transportation; carbon emission; emission control; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; Monte Carlo analysis; pollution policy; sustainability; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85071110133

However, this challenge is difficult to address quantitatively based on the sole use of bulk chemical properties. Nitrogenous aerosols, mainly ammonium (NH+4 ) and nitrate (NO-3), play a particularly important role in tropospheric cloud formation. While dry and wet (mainly rainfall) deposition of NH+4 and NO-3 are regularly assessed, cloud water deposition is often underappreciated. Here we collected cloud water samples at the summit of Mt. Tai (1545m above sea level) in eastern China during a long-lasting biomass burning (BB) event and simultaneously measured for the first time the isotopic compositions (mean ±1σ/ of cloud water nitrogen species (δ15N-NH+4 = -6.53%±4.96 %, δ15N-NO-3 =-2.35%±2.00 %, δ18O-NO-3 = 57.80%±4.23 %), allowing insights into their sources and potential transformation mechanism within the clouds. Large contributions of BB to the cloud water NH+4 (32.9%±4.6 %) and NO-3 (28.2%±2.7 %) inventories were confirmed through a Bayesian isotopic mixing model, coupled with our newly developed computational quantum chemistry module. Despite an overall reduction in total anthropogenic NOx emission due to effective emission control actions and stricter emission standards for vehicles, the observed cloud δ15N-NO-3 values suggest that NOx emissions from transportation may have exceeded emissions from coal combustion. δ18O-NO-3 values imply that the reaction of OH with NO2 is the dominant pathway of NO-3 formation (57%±11 %), yet the contribution of heterogeneous hydrolysis of dinitrogen pentoxide was almost as important (43%±11 %). Although the limited sample set used here results in a relatively large uncertainty with regards to the origin of cloud-associated nitrogen deposition, the high concentrations of inorganic nitrogen imply that clouds represent an important source of nitrogen, especially for nitrogen-limited ecosystems in remote areas. Further simultaneous and long-term sampling of aerosol, rainfall, and cloud water is vital for understanding the anthropogenic influence on nitrogen deposition in the study region. © 2019 Author(s).",,"anthropogenic source; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric deposition; biomass burning; chemical property; cloud water; concentration (composition); emission inventory; isotopic composition; nitrogen; China; Shandong; Tai Shan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073036483

However, all of the studies assume a closed economy setting, where there is no interaction of the economy with an outside economy; this paper fills the gap by constructing a two-city E-DSGE model that features labor migration. With the model, we solve for the optimal environmental tax rate determined by a Ramsey social planner, who maximizes household utility and takes into account the policy's impact on labor migration. We find the following. (i) The optimal environmental tax rate should be more volatile and procyclical than the rates predicted in the aforementioned literature. (ii) In the closed economy setting, a higher environmental tax rate would always dampen production, while in our setting, it could stimulate output through deterring labor outflowand attracting labor inflow. (iii)We complement the existing literature by emphasizing that the optimal environmental tax rate in a city should respond not only to the shocks that occur internally, but also to those that occur in the opponent city. In particular, we find that it is optimal to reduce the environmental tax rate if a positive total factor productivity (TFP) shock occurs in the neighbor city. © 2019 by the authors.","E-DSGE model; Environmental tax; Migration","environmental policy; environmental tax; factor productivity; labor supply; numerical model; stochasticity; total factor productivity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073609652

Traditional actors such as governments and international organizations leave deficits in norm development, enforcement, capacity building, and financing. Orchestration has been suggested under the functionalist assumption that transnational actors can make up for these deficits, through optimizing complementarity between the realms of international and transnational governance and through eliciting more action toward the achievement of globally agreed climate goals. In the context of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), orchestration has taken the form of an evolving Global Climate Action Agenda (GCAA). Few studies have examined the role of orchestration in bolstering transnational adaptation. This article therefore asks: Has the GCAA effectively mobilized and prioritized transnational adaptation action? Further, has it effectively addressed functional, participatory, and geographic deficits? Analyzing a unique dataset of a hundred cooperative climate actions, this study finds that current patterns are incongruent with some functionalist expectations. GCAA orchestration has featured a political prioritization of both adaptation and mitigation and a focus on building a positive narrative of climate action. This combination of priorities has led to neglect of underperforming actions—many of them adaptation actions in developing countries. Subsequent iterations of the GCAA failed to recognize these actions and did not identify support needed for them. This has strengthened the bias toward mitigation aspects of climate change and exacerbated imbalances in the geography of transnational action under the GCAA. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate change adaptation; Governance; Non-state actors; Orchestration; UNFCCC","action plan; adaptive management; global change; global climate; governance approach; government; multinational enterprise; prioritization; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066485238

Therefore, studies on island in specific aspect (ecological, social and economic) is very essential for sustainable resource management and future development. Mangroves are highly important natural resources of coastal regions in respect to coastal livelihood and natural defense. Although, around 46% of the mangrove forest area has vanished worldwide in the last few decades. In this present research, Future Mangrove Suitability Index (FMSI) using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method has been performed for sustainable forest management under the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal no 15. It is a new framework applied on North and Middle Andaman Island to determine the future distribution of mangrove forest. Land-use and land-covers (LULC) are prepared in supervised classification (maximum likelihood algorithm) techniques with 3000 signatures. A total number of fourteen parameters has been used in multi-criteria decision making (MCDM) platform to generate future scenarios. Among them, Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) projected climatic data (RCP 6.0 scenario shows the best result comparing to 4.5 and 8.5) and projected population data has been used for the first time in the investigated area. The final results are validated using 556 field sample point. Seven major sensitive parameters have been selected from sensitivity analysis and three statistical correlation analysis has been performed using 300 field points to generate the actual correlation between the parameters. The final outcome shows that major unsuitable zones are located in Diglipur tehsil whereas; highest suitable zones are located in Rangat tehsil region which are the result of the continuous increase of sea surface height (1.5 mm observed during 1980–2009), seismic events with frequent storm surges, anthropogenic influences and impact of climate change. Thus a planned sustainable development practice is essential to control the biodiversity loss and future livelihood management.

The technical feasibility of the CCU value chain components (carbon capture, transportation and utilization) has been widely studied in literature. However infrastructural, regulatory and business strategic issues have received less attention. A review of the relevant policies (e.g. European Emissions Trading Scheme, Renewable Fuels and Waste Directives) has been performed. Stakeholder engagement and the stakeholder influence mapping was used to examine potential climate change, circular economy, renewable energy and regional industrial development policies that can support CO2 utilization value chains. The main contribution of the paper is to outline potential benefits of policies to foster the production and uptake of CO2-derived products such as methanol, polyurethane and mineral construction aggregates. Another outcome is to illustrate the role of key policy-making stakeholders in assessing the suitability of current statutes and the impact of potential changes. An important finding was that the development of connectivity infrastructure is a key missing enabler and more attention to policy on infrastructure is required.

Furthermore, while many studies have achieved a broadscreen analysis across several pools, fewer studies have followed the water quality of pools over time, with information regarding the production and fate of DBPs in pools over extended periods (e.g. > 1 year) being limited. This study reports the occurrence of 39 DBPs and several general water quality parameters in two newly built and filled swimming pools over 15 months, where investigations began prior to opening. DBP concentrations measured in this study were generally similar to or higher than those previously reported in chlorinated pools, with concentrations of chloroacetic acid, dichloroacetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, and chloral hydrate (trichloroacetaldehyde) in some samples being higher than previously reported maximum concentrations. Considering both pools, lower concentrations of DBPs were measured in the pool where a steady state non-purgeable organic carbon concentration was achieved, highlighting the importance of the establishment of a steady state balance of mineralisation versus addition of organic carbon to reduce precursors for DBP formation in pools. Pools were found to exhibit significantly higher estimated cytotoxicity than their filling water, which reflects the significantly higher concentrations of DBPs measured in the pools in comparison to the filling water. Chloral hydrate accounted for up to 99% the total estimated cytotoxicity and was found to be correlated to the number of pool entries, suggesting that swimmers may be a potential source of chloral hydrate precursors in pools. The presence and subsequent peak of non-purgeable organic carbon and DBPs prior to, and soon after, opening suggest that the building process and/or new pool infrastructure may have had a significant impact on the chemical water quality, particularly on DBP formation.

Furthermore, a novel control strategy, called “Boundary Expansion Scenario”, has been proposed, where the boundary of the ZEB-EV interactions can be expanded from the conventional local parking to the remote parking, so that the EV batteries can be fully utilized regardless of the parking location. The impact of the renewable energy system, the Vehicle-to-Building (V2B)interactions and the boundary expansion scenarios on the zero-emission performance of the office building and the EVs have been comprehensively investigated. The research results show that by merely activating the V2B function without the “Boundary Expansion Scenario”, the V2B capability can only lead to less than 5% of the enhancement of the matching capabilities, since 93.4% of the surplus renewable electricity occur mainly during the non-parking hours. However, by further activating the “Boundary Expansion Scenario”, the net zero-emission system can simultaneously enable the features of the significantly enhanced matching capabilities (the OEFe and OEMe both at 62%), the much intensified building-vehicle interactions (the EB2V at 18.73 kWh/m2.a and the EV2B at 14.87 kWh/m2.a), and an almost full renewable coverage of the EV storages (the renewable energy ratio at 96.9%). © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Building-to-vehicle; Renewable energy; Vehicle-building integration; Vehicle-to-building; Zero emission building; Zero energy system","Air pollution; Chemical activation; Energy conservation; Expansion; Office buildings; Renewable energy resources; Vehicles; Building integration; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Renewable energy systems; Transportation sector; Zero emission buildings; Zero energies; Zero energy buildings; alternative energy; building; electric vehicle; energy storage; parking; photovoltaic system; wind turbine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066099428

This study expands the input-output relationship into the production-consumption relationship. It uses optimized data of the relationship between household consumption and production industry to calculate the entire production-side carbon emissions, including from capital formation, of Chinese household consumption, and uses LMDI model to analyze the factors affecting the growth of carbon emissions from Chinese household consumption. The results show that the carbon emissions of Chinese household consumption grew steadily from 2005 to 2015 almost 50% of carbon emissions were accounted for by high growth rates in residence consumption. Carbon emissions and growth rate of urban households’ consumption are significantly higher than the same figures for rural households. The carbon emissions intensity of all types of household consumption except residence and education has shown a downward trend. Household consumption structure and income level are the two main factors that promote the growth of household carbon emissions. Urbanization level and population size are secondary factors while household consumption carbon intensity is an important factor for curbing the growth of household consumption emissions. The study also proposes policy recommendations on how to improve the consumption structure of households, reduce the carbon intensity of household consumption, and curb the growth of carbon emissions from urban households. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Capital formation; Carbon emissions; Carbon mitigation; Household consumption; Input-output analysis","carbon; capital formation; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; economic growth; environmental management; estimation method; growth rate; input-output analysis; population size; Article; capital; carbon footprint; Chinese; decomposition; education; entropy; environmental policy; food; household; population size; rural area; traffic and transport; urbanization; industry; urbanization; China; Carbon; Industry; Urbanization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067845256

Considering that the terrestrial access problem faced by Port of Santos has not yet been analyzed, this research aims to evaluate the logistical and environmental effectiveness of the organizational method adopted in Santos to address this problem, having as reference the solutions adopted by ports in developed countries. The organization method of terrestrial access adopted in Santos proved to be an effective alternative from a logistics operation perspective with the implementation of the regulating yard.

Herein, a poly(butyl acrylate/1-ethyl-3-vinylimidazole bis[(trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl]imide)-based quasi-solid-state copolymer electrolyte poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA-P(BA-co-[EVIm]TFSI) QPE-IL) was prepared for lithium-sulfur batteries. The butyl acrylate component with abundant ester groups ensures the strong chemical capture for LiPSs. What is more, the introduction of ionic liquid ([EVIm]TFSI) can greatly improve the ionic conductivity and lithium-ion migration rate. More importantly, the dynamic-reversible adsorption of LiPSs was realized by chemical adsorption of ester-rich groups and electrostatic repulsion of free-moving negatively charged ions. As a result, the lithium-sulfur battery assembled by a reduced graphene oxide/carbon nanotube film@sulfur (rGOCTF@S) self-supporting cathode and QPE-IL displayed a high initial discharge capacity of 1179 mA h g-1, good cycling stability (72% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 0.5 C), and superior rate performance.

Practices that build soil organic matter on agricultural lands also increase soil water holding capacity, potentially reducing climatic water deficit (CWD), increasing actual evapotranspiration (AET) and increasing groundwater recharge (RCH). We developed nine spatially-explicit land use and conservation scenarios (2001-2100) in the LUCAS land use change model to address two questions for California working lands (cropland and rangeland): How does land use change limit opportunities to manage soils for hydrologic climate adaptation benefits? To what extent and where can soil management practices increase climate adaptation on protected working lands? Hydrologic benefits [Σ(CWD, AET, RCH)] due to soil management were simulated in the Basin Characterization Model (a state-wide water balance model) for two Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 climate models. LUCAS simulated land conversion and new conservation easements with potential for maximum hydrologic benefits. Climate drove differences in lost potential for water benefits due to urbanization (33.9-87.6 m3 × 106) in 2050. Conflict between development pressure and potential hydrologic benefits occurred most in Santa Clara County in the San Francisco Bay Area and Shasta County in Northern Sacramento Valley. Hydrologic benefits on easements were similar in magnitude to losses from development. Water savings from management of California Land Conservation (a.k.a. Williamson) Act contract lands were an order of magnitude greater, totaling over 460 m3 × 106 annually in a drier climate by 2050. Few counties provide most benefits because of soil properties, climate and land area protected. The increase in hydrologic benefits varies by agricultural practice and adoption rate, land use type and configuration, and terms of conservation agreements. The effectiveness of programs designed to improve climate adaptation at county to state scales will likely increase by taking this variability into consideration. © 2019 The Author(s).

However, large investments are required to retrofit existing industrial plants, which remains the largest barrier to implementing energy saving solutions. Process integration methods can be used to identify the best investments to improve the efficiency of plants, yet their timing remains to be answered using an optimisation approach. Even more critically, such decisions must also account for future investments to avoid stranded or regretted investments. This paper presents a method incorporating investment planning over long time horizons in the framework of process integration. The time horizon is included by formulating the problem using multiple investment periods. Investment planning is conducted using a superstructure approach, which permits both commissioning and decommissioning of units in the beginning of each period. The method is applied to a large case study, with an industrial cluster neighbouring an urban centre to also explore options of heat integration between industries and cities. Compared to the business-as-usual operation, optimal investment planning improves the operating cost of the system by 27% without budget constraints and 16-26% with constraints on budget and investment periods, which is reflected as an increase in net present value and a decrease in CO2 emissions. In all cases, the operating cost benefits pay off the investment in less than two years. The present work is efficient in finding energy saving solutions based on the interest of industries. This method adds additional perspectives in the decision-making process and is adaptable to various time horizons, budgets and economic constraints. © 2019 by the authors.","Energy efficiency; Investment planning; Long time horizons; MILP; Process integration","Budget control; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Decision making; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Industrial emissions; Industrial plants; Integer programming; Operating costs; Decision making process; Industrial investments; Investment planning; MILP; Process integration; Resource efficiencies; Time horizons; World energy consumption; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075564961

However, data sets that allow for the full range of species turnover from colonization to extinction over relevant time periods are limited. The late Quaternary record provides unique opportunities to explore the traits that may have influenced interspecific variation in responses to past climate warming, in particular the rate at which species colonized newly suitable habitat or went locally extinct from degrading habitat. We controlled for differences in species climate niches in order to predict expected colonization and extinction sequences recorded in packrat middens from 15 localities in the Mohave, Sonoran, and Chihuahuan deserts of North America. After accounting for temperature niche differences, we tested the hypotheses that dispersal syndrome (none, wind, vertebrate), growth form (herb, shrub, tree) and seed mass mediated variation in postglacial colonization lags among species, whereas clonality (clonal, non-clonal), growth form, and seed mass affected extinction lags. Growth form and dispersal syndrome interactively affected colonization lags, where herbaceous species lacking long-distance dispersal mechanisms exhibited lags that exceeded those of woody, wind or vertebrate-dispersed species by an average of 2,000–5,000 yr. Growth form and seed mass interactively affected extinction lags, with very small-seeded shrubs persisting for 4,000–8,000 yr longer than other functional groups. Taller, vertebrate-dispersed plants have been shown in other studies to disperse farther than shorter plants without specialized dispersal mechanisms. We found that variation along this axis of dispersal syndromes resulted in dramatic differences in colonization rates in response to past climate change. Very small seeded shrubs may have a unique combination of long vegetative and seed bank lifetimes that may allow them to persist for long periods despite declines in habitat condition. This study indicates that readily measurable traits may help predict which species will be more or less sensitive to future climate change, and inform interventions that can stabilize and promote at-risk populations. © 2019 by the Ecological Society of America","climate change; dispersal limitation; dispersal syndrome; extinction debt; paleoecology; seed size","climate change; colonization; dispersal; extinction; functional group; growth form; herb; interspecific variation; Last Glacial Maximum; life history trait; paleoclimate; paleoecology; plant; Postglacial; Quaternary; seed size; species diversity; type locality; Vertebrata; climate change; ecosystem; life history trait; North America; plant; species extinction; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Extinction, Biological; Life History Traits; North America; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070898270

The Paris Agreement of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change entered into force in 2016 with the objective of strengthening the global response to climate change by keeping global temperature rise this century well below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 °C. The agreement requires all Parties to submit their “nationally determined contributions” (NDCs) and to strengthen these efforts in the years ahead. Reducing carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation is an important strategy for mitigating climate change, particularly in developing countries with large forests. Extensive tropical forest loss and degradation have increased awareness at the international level of the need to undertake large-scale ecological restoration, highlighting the need to identify cases in which restoration strategies can contribute to mitigation and adaptation. Here we consider Brazil as a case study to evaluate the benefits and challenges of implementing large-scale restoration programs in developing countries. The Brazilian NDC included the target of restoring and reforesting 12 million hectares of forests for multiple uses by 2030. Restoration of native vegetation is one of the foundations of sustainable rural development in Brazil and should consider multiple purposes, from biodiversity and ecosystem services conservation to social and economic development. However, ecological restoration still presents substantial challenges for tropical and mega-diverse countries, including the need to develop plans that are technically and financially feasible, as well as public policies and monitoring instruments that can assess effectiveness. The planning, execution, and monitoring of restoration efforts strongly depend on the context and the diagnosis of the area with respect to reference ecosystems (e.g., forests, savannas, grasslands, wetlands). In addition, poor integration of climate change policies at the national and subnational levels and with other sectorial policies constrains the large-scale implementation of restoration programs. The case of Brazil shows that slowing deforestation is possible; however, this analysis highlights the need for increased national commitment and international support for actions that require large-scale transformations of the forest sector regarding ecosystem restoration efforts. Scaling up the ambitions and actions of the Paris Agreement implies the need for a global framework that recognizes landscape restoration as a cost-effective nature-based solution and that supports countries in addressing their remaining needs, challenges, and barriers. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.","Brazilian NDC; Environmental monitoring; Environmental policy; Forestry sector; Landscape degradation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065202873

Exploring a case study of district heating development to support heat decarbonisation in the United Kingdom (UK), this article uses thematic analysis of qualitative semistructured interviews conducted between May 2013 and August 2015 with local and regional government officials, in order to consider how energy planning decision-making tools can be designed to support the early stages of low carbon transitions as a form of strategic niche management. The findings of this analysis are then tested through the development of a spatial heat planning tool covering England and Wales, designed to respond to the needs of niche actors seeking to facilitate early development of district heating projects. The tool is for use by local government actors as they seek to build social networks of stakeholders to support the technology change, to demonstrate its value and to support skills development. The research shows the importance of designing flexible tools which can go beyond techno-economic criteria and reflect the wider motivations and decision criteria of local actors, including social criteria. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

However, there is little consideration of whether the species being planted will be resilient to climate change. We assessed the distribution of climatically suitable habitat, now and in the future, for 176 tree species native to Australia, commonly planted across Australia's Significant Urban Areas (SUAs) and currently grown by commercial nurseries. Species' occurrence records were obtained from inventories and herbaria, globally and across Australia, and combined with baseline climate data (WorldClim, 1960–1990) and six climate scenarios for 2030 and 2070 using climatic suitability models (CSMs). CSMs for each species were calibrated and projected onto baseline and future scenarios. We calculated changes in the size of climatically suitable habitat for each species across each SUA, and identified urban areas that are likely to have suitable climate for either fewer or more of our study species under future climate. By 2070, climatically suitable habitat in SUAs is predicted to decline for 73% of species assessed. For 18% of these species, climatically suitable area is predicted to be more than halved, relative to their baseline extent. Generally, for urban areas in cooler regions, climatically suitable habitat is predicted to increase. By contrast, for urban areas in warmer regions, a greater proportion of tree species may lose climatically suitable habitat. Our results highlight changing patterns of urban climatic space for commonly planted species, suggesting that local governments and the horticultural industry should take a proactive approach to identify new climate-ready species for urban plantings. © 2019","Climate change; Horticulture industry; Species distribution models; Species selection; Urban trees; Vulnerability","Climate models; Ecosystems; Forestry; Population distribution; Climate scenarios; Horticultural industry; Local government; Pro-active approach; Species distribution models; Species selection; Urban trees; Vulnerability; Climate change; climate change; habitat; horticulture; species occurrence; tree; urban climate; vulnerability; article; Australia; climate change; government; habitat; horticulture; human; nursery; species distribution; urban area; city; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; forecasting; statistics and numerical data; theoretical model; tree; Australia; Australia; Cities; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Forecasting; Models, Theoretical; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066636698

Thereby, several aspects can be explicitly addressed, including a regionally differentiated accountability of sustainable feedstock availability, identification of environmental impacts along global value chains, and identification of trade-offs between different sustainability goals. The model is applied to assess the optimal choice between two lignocellulosic biorefinery concepts. Two optimization objectives are taken into account: maximizing the investor's profit and minimizing global impacts on climate change related to a specified demand for products. In terms of environmental impacts, the model also takes into account the comparison of new biorefineries with current available technologies producing the specified final demand. The results of the case study show that the biorefinery concept including the ethylene production is more beneficial in terms of reducing climate impacts, while on the other hand the biorefinery including the ethanol production is more cost-effective. Depending on the decision-maker's preference on weighting the two objectives, different capacities of biorefineries and optimal locations in Germany are identified. Furthermore, regions in Germany providing the necessary biomass feedstock can be identified on a county level. Finally, we argue that the extension of LCA by multi-objective optimization is well suited guiding the way toward well-informed decision-making in the field of technological choices. © 2019 by Yale University","biomass; hybrid LCA; industrial ecology; linear programming; multi-objective","Bioconversion; Biomass; Climate change; Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Ethylene; Feedstocks; Life cycle; Linear programming; Refining; Sustainable development; Biorefinery concept; Decision maker's preferences; Ethylene production; Hybrid LCA; Industrial ecology; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Multi objective; Multi-objective optimization models; Multiobjective optimization; biomass; bioreactor; cellulose; ethanol; ethylene; industrial ecology; life cycle analysis; lignin; multiobjective programming; optimization; refining industry; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85063980438

A potential reduction could be achieved by transitioning towards more efficient transport modes, optimally powered by renewable energy. Based on mobility (commutes), population, and weather data from Switzerland, we present a model to compute energy savings due to a (hypothetical) widespread deployment of electric bicycles. In different scenarios, we analyze the dependence of the commuting energy demand on users’ preferences about when to take the bike, such as an aversion to biking on cold and rainy days. Our study shows that GHG emission reductions of up to approx. 10% of the total emissions from diesel and gasoline are possible. In combination with a widespread deployment of electric vehicles, further savings of up to 17.5% could be achieved. In particular, the willingness to drive longer commutes by e-bike influences the potential GHG emission reductions, followed by the willingness to use the bicycle at temperatures below 10°C. Using these results, we identify the spatial energy and greenhouse gas savings potential and thus regions that are particularly suited for e-bike use. The identification of regions with high saving potentials allows for targeted marketing, transition-supporting incentives, or infrastructural changes to maximize the reduction of emissions. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Electric bicycles; Mobility; Renewable energy","Bicycles; Carrier mobility; Digital storage; Electric vehicles; Emission control; Energy conservation; Gas emissions; Population statistics; Sporting goods; Electric bicycles; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Potential reduction; Reduction of emissions; Renewable energies; Saving potentials; Targeted marketing; Total emissions; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070194985

This means that the system should be acceptable now and its expected future effects should be acceptable, in particular in relation to resource availability, consequences of functioning and morality of action. However, there are many components of sustainability. People who consider only one aspect may not advocate the best solution. If the focus is entirely on: animal welfare, preservation of rare wildlife species, maximising local biodiversity or minimising greenhouse gas production may cause other harms. When an agricultural or other product is considered, life cycle analyses can take account of every contributory factor. Every externality of the system should be evaluated and the value of each balanced. Some actions that improve animal welfare may also have positive environmental effects and each aspect can be measured. If straw from cereal production is burned, carbon dioxide is released but if it is used as bedding or for manipulation welfare is improved and the greenhouse gas effect can be reduced. Taking wild animals to keep as pets leads to poor welfare and wild populations are reduced. Stray dogs have a negative impact on the populations and welfare of some wild animals. Stray dog welfare is often poor because of disease and malnutrition so humanely killing the dogs can prevent poor welfare and benefit conservation. The land-sparing argument, encouraging intensive animal production so more land is available for nature reserves, would favour feedlots for beef production but the welfare of the cattle in feedlots is often poor and water usage and pollution can be high. However, semi-intensive silvopastoral systems are very efficient and their use of shrubs and trees greatly increases biodiversity, reduces greenhouse gas production per unit of production, reduces conserved water usage and improves welfare. Conserving land for hunting wild animals increases biodiversity but the hunting usually causes poor welfare. Where endangered species cannot adapt well to captive conditions, captive breeding might preserve the species but the welfare of the captive animals is poor. When a system is being evaluated, each of the many components of sustainability should be measured precisely: welfare, biodiversity, worker satisfaction, water use, greenhouse gas production and harmful accumulation of pollutants like nitrogen and phosphorus. Decision-making may involve developing units for comparison of each positive and negative consequence or considering any negative that is so great that no counter-balancing would ever be acceptable to the public. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",,"animal welfare; biodiversity; canid; captive breeding; carbon dioxide; cattle; decision making; endangered species; life cycle; nature reserve; rare species; straw; sustainability; Animalia; Bos; Canis familiaris",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068135532

The high level of international participation in the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation meeting in Beijing led to a desire for good air quality. Improved air quality required stringent emission controls in the first half of November. The resultant blue skies at this time attracted widespread comment and was thought to be responsible for the growing use of the term APEC Blue. The China Daily claimed APEC Blue was the top Beijing environmental key word for 2014, an expression it saw coined to describe these clear skies. However, APEC Blue may have other meanings, and convey more a sense of something wonderful, yet fleeting; the phrase often describes the temporary nature of improvements and was used more frequently during the low pollution days of APEC. There are also comments that the controls impose a heavy burden on citizens and even hint at a sense of deception. We explore the use of the term APEC Blue on social media and in publications and argue that it reflects a growing concern about regulation of air pollution in Beijing, particularly suggesting that the pubic doubts the appropriateness of short-term solutions to China's air pollution problems.

The steady growth of bio-based products however, drives the need to investigate their End-of-Use (EoU)/End-of-Life (EoL) alternatives. A critical review of the inventory of targeted valorization options for bio-based plastic waste is presented with limitations and opportunities. Impacts on the conventional waste management routes and the environment are considered. The provisions of the circular economy package, the targets and objectives set by the relevant EU environmental legislation, are used as key drivers for developing the inventory of the alternative EoU/EoL routes. Optimal alternative EoU/EoL routes are defined for the bio-based products in such a way that they are turned into valuable resources for the circular economy.

Yet, questions still remain about the effectiveness of indoor air cleaners on indoor PM2.5 concentrations and personal exposure to potentially hazardous components of PM2.5. Metals in PM2.5 have been associated with adverse health outcomes, so knowledge of their sources in urban indoor and outdoor areas and how exposures are influenced by indoor air cleaners would be beneficial for public health interventions. We collected 48-h indoor, outdoor, and personal PM2.5 exposure samples for 43 homes with asthmatic children in suburban Shanghai, China during the spring months. Two sets of samples were collected for each household, one set with a functioning air filter placed in the bedroom (“true filtration”) and the other with a non-functioning (“sham”) air cleaner. PM2.5 samples were analyzed for elements, elemental carbon, and organic carbon. The major sources of metals in PM2.5 were determined by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to be regional aerosol, resuspended dust, residual oil combustion, roadway emissions, alloy steel abrasion, and a lanthanum (La) and cerium (Ce) source. Under true filtration, the median indoor to outdoor percent removal across all elements increased from 31% to 78% and from 46% to 88% across all sources. Our findings suggest that indoor air cleaners are an effective strategy for reducing indoor concentrations of PM2.5 metals from most sources, which could translate into improved health outcomes for some populations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Indoor air quality; Particulate matter; Positive matrix factorization; Source apportionment","Air pollution; Air quality; Alloy steel; Factorization; Health; Indoor air pollution; Matrix algebra; Metals; Organic carbon; Particles (particulate matter); Atmospheric fine particulate matter; Chemical compositions; Health interventions; Indoor air quality; Indoor concentration; Particulate Matter; Positive Matrix Factorization; Source apportionment; Air cleaners; alloy; cerium; lanthanum; metal; organic carbon; metal; air quality; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; concentration (composition); indoor air; metal; particulate matter; pollution exposure; source apportionment; suburban area; abrasion; adolescent; adverse event; aerosol; air pollution; Article; asthma; awareness; chemical analysis; chemical composition; child; China; clinical outcome; combustion; concentration (parameter); controlled study; dust exposure; environmental exposure; environmental impact assessment; highway; human; particulate matter; public health; seasonal variation; spring; suburban area; air filter; air pollutant; dust; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; filtration; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; season; China; Shanghai; Aerosols; Air Filters; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution, Indoor; Child; China; Dust; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Monitoring; Filtration; Humans; Metals; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068824073

Species can be identified using taxonomic keys based on adult morphology and genitalia. The genus includes 261 species attacking conifers and non-conifer plants in many areas in the world, among which 40 species are present in the EU. The non-EU species are collectively listed in Annex IAI of Council Directive 2000/29/EC as Acleris spp. (non-European). Some species are important defoliators in North America, mainly on conifers but also on several broadleaf trees. Females lay eggs on the leaves or on the bark. The larvae bind together with silk the leaves upon which they feed. Pupation occurs in leaves attached with silk or in the soil. Some species are univoltine; others are bivoltine or multivoltine. Flight capacity is not documented, but outbreak expansion suggests that the adults can probably fly long distances. The main pathways for entry are host plants for planting with or without soil, cut branches, fruits of host plants (including cones), round wood with bark and bark. The presence of host plants and suitable EU climate would allow the establishment of the known non-EU harmful species. In the literature, nine non-EU Acleris species are reported as pests on various host plants, namely A. gloverana, A. variana, A. minuta, A. nishidai, A. issikii, A. semipurpurana, A. robinsoniana, A. senescens and A. nivisellana. These non-EU Acleris spp. satisfy all the criteria to be considered as Union quarantine pests. Concerning the other 212 non-EU Acleris species, there is scarce information on host plants, pests status and climatic suitability. Measures are in place to prevent the introduction of non-EU Acleris spp. through the pathways described in the document. As non-EU Acleris spp. are not present in the EU and plants for planting are not the major pathway for spread, non-EU Acleris spp. do not meet the criteria to be considered as regulated non-quarantine pests. © 2019 European Food Safety Authority.

The purpose of this paper is to evaluate the technical potential of the photovoltaic renewable energy sources available in Republic of Moldova with scope to contribute to achievement the goals of the Energy Strategy until 2030, the main state document in the field of energy. The Republic of Moldova is an Associate Membership of the EU and a Membership of Energy Community. These facts determines the country's development direction and policies of its energy sector. The goals of this Strategy include diversification of energy sources, inclusively RES, ensuring the share of annual electricity production from RES at least 15% (about 1, 274 TWh) in 2030 and reducing greenhouse gases emissions by 25% in 2020. Republic of Moldova has an insignificant amount of fossil energy resources (coal, natural gas and oil). At the same time, the renewable electricity production is insignificant and the economy entirely depends on imports of fossil energy resources from neighbor countries. Thus, there is considerable delay in achieving Strategy's goals. © 2019 IEEE.","electricity production; electricity sources; photovoltaic energy; renewable energy technical potential","Climate change; Coal deposits; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Natural gas deposits; Climate change mitigation; Electricity production; Electricity source; Greenhouse gases emissions; Photovoltaic energy; Renewable electricity production; Technical potential; Use of renewable energies; Renewable energy resources",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076200719

We have developed a roadmap for evaluating the contribution of both private- and public-good ecosystem services generated by agricultural soils to societal welfare. The approach considers the needs of decision-makers at different levels, from farmers to policy-makers. This we achieve through combining production functions-to quantify the impacts of alternative management practices on agricultural productivity and soil ecosystem services-with non-market valuation of changes in public-good ecosystem services and benefit-cost analysis. The results show that the net present value to society of implementing soil-friendly measures are substantial, but negative for farmers in our study region. Although we apply our roadmap to an intensive farming region in Sweden, we believe our results have broad applicability, because farmers do not usually account for the value of public-good ecosystem services. We therefore conclude that market outcomes are not likely to be generating optimal levels of soil ecosystem services from society's perspective. Innovative governance institutions are needed to resolve this market failure to safeguard the welfare of future generations. © 2019 by the authors.","Benefit-cost analysis; Climate change; Food security; Natural capital; Nutrient retention; Policy; Soil carbon; Valuation","agricultural practice; agricultural science; agricultural soil; climate change; decision making; food security; management practice; natural capital; policy making; soil carbon; soil ecosystem",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073625523

On the other hand, any such development will have health and environmental impacts, issues that have been repeatedly raised by the local community; as well as implications for Kenya's emissions and related climate targets, a concern for the international community working on climate change. Using the proposed Lamu coal power plant in Kenya, this research draws on political settlement theory and discourse network analysis to reveal the influence of structural features of the context, the location of power, the distribution of benefits and how actors employ discursive strategies to protect their interests. The analysis suggests that although there is broad civil society opposition to the plant, there is significant backing from the Presidency, big business interests and the necessary regulatory bodies. The arguments made by supporters, such as cheap, baseload electricity appear to contradict the recommendations for coal, of electricity planning processes in Kenya, which indicate the plant could lead to surplus electricity supply, thereby increasing the price of electricity. The controversies surrounding the ongoing National Environmental Tribunal have also illustrated some of the political motives at play. More broadly, the plant appears to be part of an infrastructure development vision championed by President Kenyatta and supported by a growing relationship with China, suggesting the future of coal may be determined by interests other than robust, least cost electricity planning. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Development; Discourse; Electricity; Political settlement",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066831379

People disagree, however, about the relative importance of these two reasons. This article develops an “institutional view” to address this issue, which consists of two claims. First, many emissions of greenhouse gases that took place before the establishment of legitimate institutions of global climate governance do not give rise to climate-related duties. Second, the absence of legitimate institutional global governance, more generally, undermines full rights to wealth on the part of developed states and thus removes an objection to their having to contribute more to tackling the challenges of climate change. The upshot is that, at present, climate duties should be allocated between states mainly on the basis of wealth rather than history. © 2019 by the Southern Political Science Association.

Aurèlia Capmany 69, Girona, Catalonia, 17003, Spain","Aims: Our aims were 3-fold: (i) to determine whether global change has altered the composition and structure of the plant community found in the sessile oak forests on the NE Iberian Peninsula over the last decades, (ii) to establish whether the decline in forest exploitation activities that has taken place since the mid-20th century has had any effect on the forests and (iii) to ascertain whether there is any evidence of impact from climate warming. Methods: We assess changes in the plant community by comparing a current survey of sessile oak forest with a historical data set obtained from previous regional studies dating from 1962 to 1977. We analyse the regional changes in the community in terms of biodiversity variables, species composition and plant traits. Furthermore, plants traits such as plant life forms and chorological groups are used to discern any effects from land-use changes and climate warming on the plant community. Important Findings: There has been a loss of diversity in the community and, in the hottest region, there is also a loss of species richness. The composition of the community suggests that, although significant changes have taken place over recent decades, these changes differ between regions as a result of the low impact global change has had in the western regions. For instance, while the tree canopy cover in the western sessile oak forests remains stable, the eastern sessile oak forests are still recovering from the former exploitation that led to a loss of their rich and abundant herbaceous stratum. In fact, the recovery process in the Catalan Pre-Coastal Range has constituted an increase in the Euro-Siberian plants typical to this community. Moreover, in the eastern forests, there is evidence that climate warming has impacted the thermophilization of the sessile oak forests found on the Coastal Range. © 2019 The Author(s) 2019.

A better understanding of processes specifically causing forest degradation may be of interest to policy makers concerned with the design of programs to conserve forests, for example under international policy on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). On the basis of data from a farmer survey carried out in the western Pacific area of Mexico, this study uses a cross-sectional regression model to identify the variables that explain variations between groups of farmers in the amounts of land temporarily cleared for shifting cultivation, which results in decreasing the density of forest biomass. We found that, contrary to common perception about shifting cultivation, within each community, many farmers, both richer and poorer, carry out shifting cultivation. Moreover, it is the wealthier farmers that are making more temporary clearances for such activities when compared with those with less resources. We conclude that, for effectiveness in the design of national programs for REDD+, intra-community differences in farmer status should be taken into account. Moreover, REDD+ interventions should consider the impacts of this program on farmers without rights to land. © 2019 by the authors.","Farmers' choices; Forest degradation; REDD+; Rural communities","Deforestation; Regression analysis; Agricultural activities; Cross-sectional regression; Farmers' choices; Forest degradation; International policies; REDD; Rural community; Shifting cultivations; Cultivation; deforestation; emission control; farmers knowledge; regression analysis; rural society; shifting cultivation; socioeconomic impact; Cultivation; Deforestation; Degradation; International; Land; Mexico; Processes; Regression Analysis; Mexico [North America]; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073430949

For example, infrastructure with a long lifespan now needs to be designed or adapted to account for a future climate that will be different from the past or present. There is a growing necessity for the climate information used in decision making to change from traditional science-driven metrics to decision-driven metrics. This is particularly relevant in East Africa, where limited adaptation and socio-economic capacity make this region acutely vulnerable to climate change. Here, we employ an interdisciplinary consultation process to define and analyse a number of such decision-oriented metrics. These metrics take a holistic approach, addressing the key East African sectors of agriculture, water supply, fisheries, flood management, urban infrastructure and urban health. A multifaceted analysis of multimodel climate projections then provides a repository of user-focused information on climate change and its uncertainties, for all metrics and seasons and two future time horizons. The spatial character and large intermodel uncertainty of changes in temperature and rainfall metrics are described, as well as those of other relevant metrics such as evaporation and solar radiation. Intermodel relationships amongst metrics are also explored, with two clear clusters forming around rainfall and temperature metrics.

Real time monitoring of air pollution will help in calculating air quality index to issue health advisories as well as for taking necessary actions to meet standards. Air pollutants in the form of ground-level ozone and particulate matter have been the major pollutants in recent times. The proposed prototype in this paper deals with a smart Mongoose OS based monitoring system to monitor the harmful pollutants' concentration continuously. Mongoose OS is a cross-platform IoT operating system, which provides generic infrastructure layer for smart products and minimal foot print on edge device. As Monitoring is carried out uninterrupted, concerned officials get notified whenever a certain pollutant surpasses the threshold. Prototype is designed using cost effective low power ESP32 development board and appropriate sensors to monitor CO, CO2, NH3, Smoke particulates (PM-{2.5}) and Ozone. The values of pollutants (unit of measurement is PPM) captured by this prototype can be sent through message brokers to the cloud server set up using Losant IoT platform, by configuring it as Wi-Fi access point. PPM values of pollutants are then displayed on to losant device logs through MQTT protocol.

Children-from infancy to the age of 14-are especially susceptible to the health effects of traffic emissions due to their rapidly developing immune, neurologic, and lung systems and high ventilation rates. Physiologically vulnerable children in disadvantaged neighborhoods are potentially disproportionately exposed to traffic emissions due to close residential proximity to highways and other high-volume roadways. Traffic-related primary pollutants known to impact health include highly respirable fine and ultrafine particles, diesel exhaust particles and gases, particle-bound metals and carcinogens including volatile organic compounds like benzene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Consistent and compelling scientific evidence suggests prenatal and childhood exposures to primary traffic emissions can cause onset and exacerbation of asthma, delayed lung function development, and childhood leukemia. Emerging suggestive evidence links traffic emission exposures to autism spectrum disorder, delayed cognitive development, and childhood obesity. Health risks can accumulate over the life course and lead to development of adult chronic disease, disability, and premature death. Currently, the specific traffic emission constituents responsible for observed adverse effects are unknown. In light of this uncertainty, multi-sector, systems-based community design approaches towards less car-dependent, greener urban cities with affordable, quality housing and well-designed, mass transportation and active transport options will likely result in the most successful, sustainable, and cost-effective strategies for improving child wellbeing. Effective evidence-based single sector strategies for reducing child total exposures include indoor air treatment, noise and vegetation roadside barriers, and strategies for reducing urban diesel emissions. Where resources are strictly constrained, validated data-driven planning models can bring together key stakeholders including community members, government agencies, and public- and private-sector organizations and guide prioritization and implementation of evidence-based, mutually reinforcing single sector interventions that can most effectively promote child health and well-being. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.

The differences between performance criteria of academic and non-academic partners make knowledge co-production unlikely to emerge and survive without protection. This paper aims to understand how different participants in knowledge co-production for climate adaptation can be protected from the norms, values, and performance criteria of their own respective organizations and communities. We found that combinations of shielding (moderating pressures from the selection environment), nurturing (supporting knowledge development), and empowerment (increasing influence over the contexts) activities lead to more successful knowledge co-production. Moreover, our analysis shows that there is no silver bullet for the protection of knowledge co-production.

To achieve the ambitious greenhouse gas-reduction targets therein, the electric power sector must be transformed fundamentally. To this end, we develop a two-stage stochastic optimization model. The proposed model determines the optimal mix of generation and transmission capacity to build to serve future demands at least cost, while respecting technical constraints and climate-related considerations. The model uses a mix of AC and high-voltage DC transmission lines, conventional and renewable generation, and different types of energy-storage units to meet these objectives. Short- and long-term uncertainties are modeled using operating conditions and scenarios, respectively. We demonstrate the model using a case study that is based on the Texas power system, with 2050 as the target year of the analysis. We include explicit carbon-emissions constraints. Doing so allows us to examine the effect of carbon-reduction targets and deep decarbonization of electricity production on investment decisions. As expected, we find that thermal-dominated power systems must transition toward having a renewable-dominated generation mix. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate policy; Energy storage; Generation-expansion planning; Stochastic optimization; Transmission-expansion planning","Carbon; Climate models; Electric energy storage; Energy storage; Environmental regulations; Expansion; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; HVDC power transmission; Investments; Optimization; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Climate policy; Generation expansion planning; Greenhouse gas reductions; Stochastic optimization model; Stochastic optimizations; Transmission capacities; Transmission expansion planning; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Electric power system planning; electricity generation; emission control; energy planning; energy storage; environmental policy; numerical model; optimization; stochasticity; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074189221

These detrimental effects are expected to increase, given the continuously growing global water demand and the associated water stress problems caused by water scarcity and population and economic growth. Along with political inclination to impose strict environmental regulations and a carbon tax on the price of freshwater, developing low-energy-consumption, low-carbon-emission desalination systems operating at low recovery is the future of SW desalination. Such desalination systems can be achieved by integrating electrodialysis, which does not have driving force limitations, with nanofiltration and brackish water reverse osmosis (RO), which provide low-energy-consumption desalination regions, to decrease energy consumption below that of current state-of-the-art RO systems. In this study, iterative optimization algorithms were developed for hybrid desalination systems. As a result, energy consumptions as low as 1.3 kWh/m3 were achieved at recoveries &lt;30%. Despite the higher cost of freshwater production compared with that of state-of-the-art RO systems, owing to utilization of larger membrane areas, the hybrid systems reduced carbon dioxide emissions and brine concentrations from 63 to 26 and 41 to 34%, respectively. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Energy optimization; Hybrid simulation; Low emission; Low recovery; Seawater desalination","Carbon dioxide; Cost benefit analysis; Economics; Energy utilization; Environmental regulations; Global warming; Hybrid systems; Iterative methods; Population statistics; Recovery; Seawater; Water filtration; Brackish water reverse osmosis; Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy optimization; Hybrid simulation; Iterative optimization algorithms; Low emission; Low energy consumption; Seawater desalination; Desalination; algorithm; carbon emission; cost analysis; desalination; energy efficiency; optimization; seawater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069679069

Different successional stages have also different capabilities of re-establishing carbon stocks. Therefore, a successful discrimination of successional stages over wide areas can lead to an improved quantification of above ground biomass and carbon stocks. The reduction of the mapping uncertainties is especially a challenge due to high heterogeneity of the tropical vegetation. In this framework, the development of innovative remote sensing approaches is required. Forests (top) height (and its spatial distribution) are an important structural parameter that can be used to differentiate between different successional stages, and can be provided by Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) acquisitions. In this context, this paper investigates the potential of forest heights estimated from TanDEM-X InSAR data and a LiDAR digital terrain model (DTM) for separating successional stages (primary or old growth and secondary forest at different stages of succession) by means of a maximum likelihood classification. The study was carried out in the region of the Tapajós National Forest (Pará, Brazil) in the Amazon biome. The forest heights for three years (2012, 2013 and 2016) were estimated from a single-polarization in bistatic mode using InSAR model-based inversion techniques aided by the LiDAR digital terrain model. The validation of the TanDEM-X forest heights with independent LiDAR H100 datasets was carried out in the location of seven field inventory plots (measuring 50 × 50 m, equivalent to 0.25 ha), also allowing for the validation of the LiDAR datasets against the field data. The validation of the estimated heights showed a high correlation (r = 0.93) and a low uncertainty (RMSE = 3 m). The information about the successional stages and forest heights from field datasets was used to select training samples in the LiDAR and TanDEM-X forest heights to classify successional stages with a maximum likelihood classifier. The identification of different stages of forest succession based on TanDEM-X forest heights was possible with an overall accuracy of about 80%. © 2019 The Authors","Forest height; Interferometry; Successional stages; Synthetic Aperture Radar; TanDEM-X; Tropical forests","Carbon; Classification (of information); Interferometry; Mapping; Maximum likelihood; Optical radar; Remote sensing; Synthetic aperture radar; Tropics; Uncertainty analysis; Forest height; Forest successional stages; Interferometric synthetic aperture radars; Maximum likelihood classifications; Maximum likelihood classifiers; Successional stages; TanDEM-X; Tropical forest; Reforestation; anthropogenic effect; biome; digital terrain model; heterogeneity; interferometry; lidar; mapping method; remote sensing; secondary forest; synthetic aperture radar; TanDEM-X; tropical forest; tropical region; vegetation type; Amazonia; Brazil; Para [Brazil]; Tapajos National Forest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069898957

It examines the potential for the planting of 15 selected tree species for carbon storage under various water-energy regimes to create carbon neutral (or negative) villa neighborhoods. Recent improvements to solar photovoltaic and reverse-osmosis desalination technology have lowered the carbon emissions for water production by over 99% relative to current gas-powered multi-stage flash desalination (0.08 kg CO2/m3 vs.12.8 kg CO2/m3). This allows trees planted in hot, desert climates to utilize treated ocean water while net sequestering between 1.7 and 38.2 kg C/tree/yr depending on species. When planted in existing neighborhood open spaces, we find that net carbon storage rates from trees are significant (15–800%) relative to operational emissions rates for building energy (cooling, lighting, equipment) when households are supplied from 100% renewable energy sources. Thus, as technology advances, landscape design strategies in the region could evolve to maximize planting to sequester carbon while also creating more comfortable outdoor spaces that enhance the livability of neighborhoods. This study provides a first step in identifying the potential for landscape architectural design to employ a tree-based, neighborhood scale, carbon storage strategy in arid regions such as those in the Arabian Peninsula. As nations move towards a carbon-neutral future, it is imperative to develop innovative solutions that address urban sustainability, especially in resource-challenged and extreme climate regions where new urban development is planned. © 2019","Arid; Carbon sequestration; Desalination; Landscape design; Sustainability","Arid regions; Carbon dioxide; Desalination; Forestry; Gas emissions; Renewable energy resources; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Abu Dhabi , United Arab Emirates; Arid; Carbon sequestration; Landscape design; Multi stage flash desalination; Renewable energy source; Reverse osmosis desalination; Urban sustainability; Water treatment; arid region; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; desalination; extreme event; landscape change; landscape planning; neighborhood; sustainability; sustainable development; urban development; Abu Dhabi [United Arab Emirates]; Arabian Peninsula; United Arab Emirates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067171691

It is energy, labor, and capital intensive, favors global warming, and ultimately has a detrimental effect on the natural resources and soil biodiversity. Furthermore, the rice-wheat cropping sequence has a number of sustainability issues, viz., declining land and water productivity, poor soil health, and arising micronutrient deficiency which is an alarming issue. Integrated approaches must be developed for improving the declining livelihoods in the region. The changing climate and its consequences are complicating the situation of the available natural resources, viz., water, soil, atmosphere, etc. Carbon (C) and water footprints need to be identified in the currently practiced rice-wheat cropping sequence for filling the gaps to improve livelihoods by one or other means. Resource conservation technologies (RCTs) partition greater fraction of water from unproductive evaporation to the desired transpiration which is further reflected on the higher grain yields. Transpiration causes a greater inflow of water and nutrients which ultimately increases the grain yield with lesser consumption of irrigation water, which further increases water productivity. There is a need to focus on the issue to sustain the rice-wheat productivity in South Asia. This book chapter is focused on all the strategies to practice climate-smart agriculture for improving livelihoods in South Asia, which include irrigation based on scheduling, precision laser leveling, direct seeded rice (DSR), mechanical transplanting, crop diversification, short-duration crop varieties, and delaying transplanting time, and reevaluate their effect on water and land productivity under divergent soil textural classes under different climatic conditions in South Asia. There is a need to come out with an integrated package for the farmers depending upon their conditions. Delineation of the residual consequence of used RCT on available moisture during the intervening periods is there, as it affects the performance of intervening crops and certainly adds to the livelihood of the farmer. The aim of this chapter is to review different technologies and their impact on land and water productivity and thereby try to come up with some integrated approach for improving livelihoods of farmers of the region. Therefore, scientists must be very careful while advocating any single RCT or a set of RCTs to the farmers with a must consideration of their social, financial, and geological conditions for enhancing both land and water productivity in South Asia. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Climate-smart agriculture; Rice-wheat cropping sequence; South Asia; Water productivity",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089169095

Reduction of tail pipe emission was concentrated and found that hybridization can ensure better results. Hybrid electric vehicle operates on electric motor as well as internal combustion engine. Battery power is one the major source of energy for driving electric motor and different battery technologies have been developed. Battery management system (BMS) controls battery parameters like State of Charge (SoC), State of Health (SoH) and Depth of Discharge (DoD) which definitely has an impact on power-torque ratings. Various drive train configurations are developed based on the power-torque requirements and size of engine/electric motor. Maintaining proper flow of energy can have better reduction in emissions, more battery life, less fuel consumption and optimum power-torque ratings. Power and torque has to be varied based on the driver's requirement, maximum power and torque may not be required all the time and that is the area to capitalize some efficiency. Higher fuel efficiency lies in managing energy flow from various power sources to final drive. Energy flow can be controlled by deploying certain logical constraints on battery management system along with drive train which optimises the losses, optimization techniques have shown better results in control of power-torque ratings. This paper explains about the various drive train configurations, battery technologies and their control techniques. Wide range of future scope has been explained by routing each and every technology involved in hybrid vehicles. © 2019 SAE International.

These PM levels needs to be reduced urgently as they increase the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory health problems for millions of people. Plants have shown to efficiently reduce PM in the air by accumulation on their leaves. In order to investigate which plant species accumulate most PM, we screened 49 common plant species for their PM accumulation capacity in one of the tropical cities with the highest PM concentrations of the world, Hanoi (Vietnam). Using this subset of plants, we tested if certain leaf characteristics (leaf hydrophilicity, stomatal densities and the specific leaf area) can predict the PM accumulation efficiency of plant species. Our results show that the PM accumulation capacity varies substantially among species and that Muntingia calabura accumulated most PM in our subset of plants. We observed that plants with hydrophilic leaves, a low specific leaf area and a high abaxial stomatal density accumulated significantly more PM. Plants with these characteristics should be preferred by urban architects to reduce PM levels in tropical environments. Muntingia calabura can be used as an efficient bio-remediation strategy to reduce PM. Plants with a lower SLA, a more hydrophilic leaf surface and higher (abaxial) stomatal densities showed higher PM accumulating capacities. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Bioremediation; Muntingia calabura (strawberry tree); Particulate matter (PM); Saturation isothermal remanant magnetization (SIRM)","Air pollution; Air quality; Bioremediation; Health risks; Hydrophilicity; Particles (particulate matter); Population statistics; Saturation magnetization; Tropics; East Asian countries; Environmental conditions; International healths; Leaf characteristics; Particulate Matter; Specific leaf area; Strawberry tree; Tropical environments; Plants (botany); atmospheric pollution; bioaccumulation; bioremediation; concentration (composition); particulate matter; remanent magnetization; tree; air pollution; Arbutus; architect; article; bioremediation; city; human; hydrophilicity; leaf area; leaf surface; nonhuman; particulate matter; Viet Nam; air pollutant; chemistry; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; plant; plant leaf; procedures; tree; urbanization; Viet Nam; Hanoi; Viet Nam; Arbutus unedo; Muntingia calabura; Air Pollutants; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Plant Leaves; Plants; Trees; Urbanization; Vietnam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069802935

In Australia, the majority of regions address building performance through the National Construction Code. However, in 2004 the New South Wales government introduced a planning instrument called the ‘Building Sustainability Index’, known as BASIX. Until now there has been limited investigation of this sustainability index approach compared with addressing issues individually through building standards. This paper presents analysis of 94,648 building energy assessments in New South Wales and 190,286 from other Australian states to explore the impact of BASIX. The results show that the building code process delivers greater certainty and higher performance than through the sustainability index. The analysis shows that 58% of homes that pass BASIX would fail the National Construction Code for thermal comfort, and that the process of improving performance through the index is more cumbersome and slower than through individual building standards. Given the need to progressively increase house energy standards, governments should be seeking both certainty and higher performance outcomes. Failure to deliver community expected minimum performance risks locking in poor performance for long-life assets, and condemning a generation of households to unnecessarily higher energy bills. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","BASIX; Building regulations; Building sustainability index; Energy efficiency; Housing; Thermal comfort","Building codes; Buildings; Codes (symbols); Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Housing; Locks (fasteners); Sustainable development; Thermal comfort; BASIX; Building performance; Building regulations; Building standards; Improving performance; Performance outcome; Policy instruments; Sustainability index; Construction; building; energy efficiency; household energy; housing; regulatory framework; sustainability; Australia; New South Wales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070292876

Among the several ions, HCO3 − and H+ have a central role, mainly due to their role on pH homeostasis. In the male reproductive tract, the major players in pH regulation and homeodynamics are carbonic anhydrases (CAs), HCO3 − membrane transporters (solute carrier 4—SLC4 and solute carrier 26—SLC26 family transporters), Na+–H+ exchangers (NHEs), monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) and voltage-gated proton channels (Hv1). CAs and these membrane transporters are widely distributed throughout the male reproductive tract, where they play essential roles in the ionic balance of tubular fluids. CAs are the enzymes responsible for the production of HCO3 − which is then transported by membrane transporters to ensure the maturation, storage, and capacitation of the spermatozoa. The transport of H+ is carried out by NHEs, Hv1, and MCTs and is essential for the electrochemical balance and for the maintenance of the pH within the physiological limits along the male reproductive tract. Alterations in HCO3 − production and transport of ions have been associated with some male reproductive dysfunctions. Herein, we present an up-to-date review on the distribution and role of the main intervenient on pH homeodynamics in the fluids throughout the male reproductive tract. In addition, we discuss their relevance for the establishment of the male reproductive potential. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Epididymal fluid; Ionic transporters; Seminiferous tubular fluid; Sperm; Spermatogenesis","adenylate cyclase; carbonate dehydratase; carbonate dehydratase II; carbonate dehydratase IV; carbonate dehydratase IX; carbonate dehydratase VII; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; estrogen receptor alpha; monocarboxylate transporter 1; monocarboxylate transporter 2; monocarboxylate transporter 3; monocarboxylate transporter 4; monocarboxylate transporter 6; monocarboxylate transporter 8; sodium ion; sodium proton exchange protein; sodium proton exchange protein 1; sodium proton exchange protein 2; sodium proton exchange protein 3; sodium proton exchange protein 4; sodium proton exchange protein 5; sodium proton exchange protein 6; sodium proton exchange protein 7; sodium proton exchange protein 8; solute carrier protein; solute carrier protein 26; solute carrier protein 26 A3; solute carrier protein 26 A6; unclassified drug; unindexed drug; bicarbonate; carbonate dehydratase; ion channel; monocarboxylate transporter; sodium proton exchange protein; cell membrane; cell survival; cellular distribution; endocytosis; homeostasis; human; male fertility; male genital system; nonhuman; pH measurement; physiological process; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; protein transport; Review; spermatozoon count; spermatozoon maturation; spermatozoon motility; animal; chemistry; fertility; homeostasis; ion transport; male; male genital system; metabolism; pH; Animals; Bicarbonates; Carbonic Anhydrases; Fertility; Genitalia, Male; Homeostasis; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ion Channels; Ion Pumps; Male; Monocarboxylic Acid Transporters; Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066992301

Even if greenhouse gases emission were reduced to zero today, global warming and the consequent climate change would continue to affect future generations: as climate is changing, human systems must learn to adapt. This study focuses on the role, the use and the management of climate information to overcome the barriers to climate change adaptation action. The article first addresses the relationship between sustainable development and climate change, regarded as “two mutually reinforcing sides of the same coin”. After a short section on the complementarity of mitigation and adaptation strategies, it analyses the barriers to investments in climate adaptation action by public authorities: the uncertainty about the magnitude and the frequency of climate change-connected events, the common wrong perception of unlikelihood of global warming consequences and the intrinsic complexity characterizing human systems are identified as major constraints. These considerations lead to introduce the concepts of soft-resilience and low-regret adaptation strategies. The discipline of climate change adaptation based on soft-approach climate resilience strategies is closely linked to information management, information technologies, communications, logistics, geographic information services and good governance. Indeed, information management is here seen as the pillar of soft-approach strategies. Low-regret strategies are defined as measures that would generate net social and/or economic benefits both under current climate and a range of future climate change scenarios. Section 5 explores potential synergies between Climate Services (understood as any service, equipment, techniques, practical knowledge and skills that can be used to increase climate resilience of human system) and Urban Facility Management services. This study identifies Innovative Urban Climate Services, an integrated system of services addressing both climate and urban issues simultaneously, as an effective, soft-approach and low-regret strategy to overcome the barriers to adaptation action. These solutions provide a general framework allowing a flexible and customized support for human systems in adapting to unavoidable impacts of climate change. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Yet, climate change impacts will not be contained within country borders, meaning that climate change adaptation governance should also consider “borderless climate risks” that cascade through the international system, in relatively simple or highly complex ways. In this paper, we demonstrate how the notion of borderless climate risks challenges the dominant territorial framing of adaptation and its problem structure. To advance knowledge, we ask: why has a territorial framing and the national and sub-national scales dominated adaptation governance? How do borderless climate risks challenge this framing and what are possible governance responses? We draw on constructivist international relations theory and propose that the epistemic community that developed to interpret climate change adaptation for decision-makers had certain features (e.g. strong environmental sciences foundation, reliance on place-based case study research) that established and subsequently reinforced the territorial framing. This framing was then reinforced by an international norm that adaptation was primarily a national or local responsibility, which has paradoxically also informed calls for international responsibility for funding adaptation. We conclude by identifying types of governance responses at three different scales—national and bilateral; transnational; international and regional—and invite more systematic evaluation by the IR community. © 2019, The Author(s).","Climate change adaptation; Climate risk; Epistemic community; Governance; Norms; UNFCCC","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; decision making; environmental risk; governance approach; international relations; territorial planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066509205

APV lies at the heart of a global energy transformation, increasing world energy demand, negative global warming effects, and global water scarcity, and offers a promising investment to farmers and new opportunities for ecologically sustainable livelihoods. As a renewable energy investment, it meets the sustainability demand by reducing climate concerns but it also opens the door to significant socioeconomic benefits. However, the final outcome of the investment depends on government policies, environmental conditions, technical progress and what materials are used in solar power systems.

These practices also implicitly assume that there is no variation across maneuvers within each test. This has implications for air pollution regulations that rely on pulmonary function tests to determine adverse effects or set standards. We perform a Monte Carlo simulation of 20,902 tests of forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), each with eight maneuvers, for an individual with empirically obtained, plausibly normal pulmonary function. Default coefficients of variation for inter- and intratest variability (3% and 6%, respectively) are employed. Measurement error is defined as the difference between results from the conventional protocol and an unconstrained, eight-maneuver alternative. In the default model, average measurement error is shown to be ∼5%. The minimum difference necessary for statistical significance at p &lt; 0.05 for a before/after comparison is shown to be 16%. Meanwhile, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has deemed single-digit percentage decrements in FEV1 sufficient to justify more stringent national ambient air quality standards. Sensitivity analysis reveals that results are insensitive to intertest variability but highly sensitive to intratest variability. Halving the latter to 3% reduces measurement error by 55%. Increasing it to 9% or 12% increases measurement error by 65% or 125%, respectively. Within-day FEV1 differences ≤5% among normal subjects are believed to be clinically insignificant.

Using the PMG panel ARDL and panel econometric technics, heterogeneity and cross-sectional dependence among the panel were considered to explore the long and short-run dynamic relationships as well as the validity of a proposed model. The results provide panel empirical evidence that there is short-term bidirectional causality between GDP, renewable electricity consumption and CO2 emissions and between non-renewable electricity consumption, GDP and renewable electricity consumption. For the long-term causal relationship, the result indicates that there is bidirectional causality between non-renewable electricity consumption and CO2 emissions. However, there is evidence of unidirectional causal relationships from GDP to CO2 emissions and non-renewable electricity consumption and from renewable electricity consumption to CO2 emissions. The findings imply that non-renewable electricity consumption and economic growth stimulate CO2 emissions in southern and northern Mediterranean countries, while renewable electricity reduces them. This empirical evidence suggests that expansion of renewable energy sources is a viable strategy for addressing energy security and reducing carbon emissions to protect the environment for future generations. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Energy policy; Mediterranean countries; Non-renewable energy consumption; Panel cointegration; Renewable energy consumption","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Electric power utilization; Energy policy; Energy security; Energy utilization; Renewable energy resources; CO2 emissions; Mediterranean countries; Non-renewable energy; Panel co integrations; Renewable energy consumption; Economic and social effects; alternative energy; carbon emission; cointegration analysis; economic development; energy policy; energy use; environmental degradation; nonrenewable resource; panel data; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070933760

Rapid greenhouse gas emissions over the past few decades already commit Earth to a warmer climate state and lock-in future extinctions. I consider what steps might be taken to protect the climate and the future of the biosphere by drawing on our understanding of the Devonian rise of forests. At stake is nothing less than the future of humanity and the fate of species we are fortunate enough to share the planet with. Summary. Drastic phase down of our carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from burning fossil fuels within decades will likely be insufficient to avoid seeding catastrophic human-caused climate change. We have to also start removing CO2 from the atmosphere, safely, affordably and within decades. Technological approaches for large-scale carbon removal and storage hold great promise but are far from the gigaton-scale required. Enhanced chemical weathering of crushed silicate rocks and afforestation are proposed CO2 removal approaches mimicking events during the Devonian rise of forests that triggered massive CO2 drawdown and the great late Palaeozoic cooling. Evidence from Earth's history suggests that if undertaken at scale, these strategies may represent key elements of a climate restoration plan but will still be far from sufficient. Climate protests by the world's youth are justified. They recognize the urgency of the situation and the intergenerational injustice of our time: current and future generations footing the immense economic and ecological bill for damaging carbon emissions they had no part in and which world leaders are failing to limit. © 2019 The Author, Plants, People, Planet © New Phytologist Trust","carbon dioxide removal; chemical weathering; climate change; Earth history; reforestation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106304844

It has been suggested that besides the shape and location of the sea surface temperature (SST) anomaly this remote connection depends on the strength and location of the atmospheric convection response in the tropical Pacific. Here we show in a perturbed physics ensemble of the Kiel Climate Model and CMIP5 models that due to a cold equatorial SST bias many climate models are in a La Niña-like mean state, resulting in a too westward position of the rising branch of the Pacific Walker Circulation. This in turn results in a convective response along the equator during ENSO events that is too far west in comparison to observations. This effect of the equatorial cold SST bias is not restricted to the tropics, moreover it leads to a too westward SLP response in the North Pacific and too westward precipitation response that does not reach California. Further we show that climate models with a reduced equatorial cold SST bias have a more realistic representation of the spatial asymmetry of the teleconnections between El Niño and La Niña. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","CMIP5; El Niño/Southern Oscillation; North Pacific teleconnections; Perturbed physics ensemble; Rainfall over California; Sea surface temperature bias","air-sea interaction; atmospheric convection; computer simulation; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; equatorial dynamics; numerical model; perturbation; rainfall; sea surface temperature; teleconnection; Walker circulation; California; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (Equatorial); Pacific Ocean (North); United States; Pomatiopsis californica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85064478960

In Australia, the main public ‘co-benefits’ that could result from carbon farming are conservation of biodiversity, increases in soil and water quality, productivity increases, and economic and cultural services for Indigenous communities. While there is a lack of empirical evidence that carbon farming is delivering these ecosystem services to date, various metrics have been developed by researchers and through other payment for ecosystem services schemes that may enable effective targeting of these co-benefits. In this article, we review previous studies and schemes and identify four main approaches for metrics that could be applied to carbon farming in Australia: (1) spatial modelling, (2) benchmarks; (3) environmental benefit indices; and (4) indicators. The relative value of each of these approaches varies, depending on the objectives of policy-makers. Spatial modelling and benchmarks can play a key role in decision support systems for landholders who may be interested in carbon farming. Indices are valuable for the development of new or modified market-based schemes that weigh up different co-benefits. Indicators are critical for outcome-based payment schemes and for verifying the effectiveness of co-benefit policies overall. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Biodiversity; Carbon farming; Indicators; Indices; Sequestration; Soil",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070279904

The elevational gradient also affects the diversity and abundance of pollinators associated with these plants. As a result, plants may have locally adapted floral traits. However, detailed assessments of multiple floral traits along elevational gradients are often neglected despite the traits being important for plant sexual reproduction. We tested the association of floral traits with pollinators in response to elevation by identifying pollinators and measuring morphological and biochemical floral traits as well as studying the breeding systems of ten aggregated Rhododendron species in the Sikkim Himalaya. Corolla length, nectar volume and distance between stamen and stigma significantly decreased with elevation. In contrast, nectar concentrations were positively associated with elevation. Birds, bumblebees and flies were the three dominant pollinator groups. Bird visits showed a strong negative association with elevation while visits by bumblebees and flies increased with elevation. Species with longer corollas and higher nectar volumes showed higher rates of bird visits, while bumblebees were associated with species that had higher nectar concentrations. Fruit set following cross-pollination was high compared to self-pollination, and higher pollen limitation and auto-fertility were observed among species in higher elevations. These observed patterns in the association between floral traits and pollinator groups in response to elevation may help generate testable hypotheses on alpine plant–pollinator responses to climate warming. © 2019, Swiss Botanical Society.","Climate change; Elevation; Floral traits; Himalaya; Pollinators; Rhododendron","biochemical composition; concentration (composition); elevation; environmental gradient; floral trait; flower visiting; local adaptation; nectar; plant-pollinator interaction; pollen limitation; shrub; Himalayas; Sikkim Himalayas; Aves; Rhododendron",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85070199214

Agronomic performance was evaluated by statistical analysis of productivity, while environmental performance was evaluated by analyzing the carbon footprint, according to ISO 14067. Agronomic analysis showed that rotation of melons with maize and Brachiaria resulted in a higher yield of melons for export. Assessment of the carbon footprint of this system in relation to the conventional system showed that the rotation system presented a lower carbon footprint. A scenario analysis showed that the carbon footprint can be further reduced by 42.54%, if: I) production takes place in areas already cultivated for more than 20 years, ii) the amount of inorganic nitrogen applied is reduced by 50%, and iii) commercialization of melons begins in the United States.

Post-fire plant communities often have increased floral abundance and diversity, but the effects of wildfires on the ecological process of pollination are poorly understood. Nocturnal moths are globally important pollinators, but no previous study has examined the effects of wildfire on nocturnal pollination interactions. We investigated the effects of wildfire on nocturnal pollen-transport networks. We analysed the abundance and species richness of moths and flowers, and the structure of these networks, at three burned and three unburned sites in Portugal for two years, starting eight months after a large fire. Nocturnal pollen-transport networks had lower complexity and robustness following the fire than at nearby unburned sites. Overall, 70% of individual moths carried pollen, and moths were found to be transporting pollen from 83% of the flower species present. Burned sites had significantly more abundant flowers, but less abundant and species-rich moths. Individual moths transported more pollen in summer at burned sites, but less in winter; however, total pollen transport by the moth assemblage at burned sites was just 20% of that at unburned sites. Interaction turnover between burned and unburned networks was high. Negative effects of fire upon moths will likely permeate to other taxa through loss of mutualisms. Therefore, if wildfires become more frequent under climate change, community resilience may be eroded. Understanding the responses of ecological networks to wildfire can inform management that promotes resilience and facilitates whole-ecosystem conservation. © 2019 The Authors.

Ecological niche models were built with MaxEnt, using occurrence data of two lineages separately, together and also using native range data. Predictive abilities of the models were compared and potential distributions of the two lineages were predicted under present and future climate scenarios. The models were projected on the native range to identify climatically suitable areas for each lineage. Significant differences between climatic niches of the two invasive lineages were found and unique climatically suitable areas for each lineage were identified. A large area of South and Southeast Asia was found to be climatically suitable for both lineages. Under climate change scenarios, pole ward range expansion for one lineage and decrease in range size along marginal areas for another lineage were predicted. However, high amount of niche unfilling for both the lineages indicated that if introduced, the lineages can establish in cold and dry areas of the invasive range. The evidence of niche abandonment between native and invasive ranges indicated presence of other lineages in its native range which are not yet introduced in this region. These findings provided baseline data for implementing management strategies at early stage of invasion and quarantine measures to protect this region from future invasions. Climatically suitable areas in the native range were identified for both lineages which can be prioritized for conducting surveys for identification of source populations and biological control agents. Our study highlights the importance of integrating genetic data in future ENM approaches to have finer scale information of species’ distribution, which can be utilized to develop region-specific and climate change-integrated management strategies for invasive species. © 2019 The Authors","Climate change; Genetic lineage; Invasion; MaxEnt; Niche modeling; Potential distribution",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072871009

The rapid increase in global temperatures during the last century due to an exponential increase of greenhouse gas concentrations is altering the climate beyond our capacity of adaptation. In order to mobilize the society towards bold, informed, coherent responses, public institutions should work together to raise awareness of the problem. The University must have a leading role in Climate Change communication, education and research in order to improve our capacity for Climate Change mitigation and adaptation. Climate Change is a complex problem that requires a multidisciplinary approach. In this paper we discuss the role of the university in front of this planetary issue. We discuss the challenges and opportunities that the university has as a source of knowledge through research but also as educators of a new generation that will be left to deal with this issue. At the University of Salamanca, we have launched a series of seminars titled ""The University facing the challenges of Climate Change"". This initiative aimed to create a dialogue involving multiple parties (academics, local community and the general public) as a way to exchange ideas and look for possible strategies to tackle Climate Change. The format of the seminar, including a face to face discussion between the parties and a virtual platform (Youtube channel), enhances the impact of our initiative. Additionally, the usage of digital media for Climate Change education and communication is discussed. Due to the widespread lack of materials in Spanish, this seminar, up to date and in an accessible format, is a powerful tool for Climate Change communication and education. © 2019 ACM.","Climate Change; Continuing Education; Digital media; Education","Digital storage; E-learning; Ecosystems; Education; Facings; Greenhouse gases; Climate change mitigation; Continuing education; Education and researches; Exponential increase; Gas concentration; Global temperatures; Multi-disciplinary approach; Public institution; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075440819

We used the field-tested Stream Segment Temperature model (U.S. Geological Survey) to simulate how altering discharge, groundwater input, channel wetted width, and shade prevents the temperatures of White Mountain, Arizona, stream reaches from exceeding the thermal tolerance of Apache Trout Oncorhynchus apache, both under existing conditions and under a climate change scenario. Simulations suggested increasing shade, either through streamside planting of specific numbers and species of plants or by other means, would be most effective and feasible for cooling the stream reaches we studied. Ponderosa pine Pinus ponderosa and Douglas fir Pseudotsuga menziesii provided the most shade followed in order by Engelman spruce Picea engelmannii, Bebb's willow Salix bebbiana, Arizona alder Alnus oblongifolia, and finally coyote willow Salix exigua. Vegetation survival depends on the appropriateness of site conditions at present and under climate change, and planting in buffer strips minimizes additional water removal from the watershed through evapotranspiration. Alternative shading options, including thick sedge growth, shade cloth, or felled woody vegetation, may be considered when environmental conditions do not support plantings. Increasing groundwater input can cool streams, but additional sources are scarce in the region. Decreasing the width-to-depth ratio would succeed best on reaches with widths greater than 2.0 m. Increasing discharge from upstream may lower water temperature on reaches with an initial discharge greater than 0.5 m3/s. Existing models provide suggestions to cool stream reaches. Further development of accessible software packages that incorporate evaporation, fragmentation, and other projected climate change effects into their routines will provide additional tools to help manage climate change effects. © 2019 American Fisheries Society",,"climate change; environmental conditions; groundwater; salmonid; strategic approach; water temperature; watershed; Arizona; United States; White Mountains [Arizona]; Alnus oblongifolia; Oncorhynchus apache; Oncorhynchus gilae apache; Picea; Picea engelmannii; Pinus ponderosa; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Salix bebbiana; Salix exigua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85073624132

Organisms may respond to such changes through habitat selection, favouring those areas less affected by ECEs; however, documenting habitat selection in response to ECEs is difficult in the wild due to the rarity of such events and the long-term biological data required. Sea level rise and changing weather patterns over the past decades have led to an increase in the frequency of coastal flooding events, with serious consequences for ground nesting shorebirds. Shorebirds therefore present a useful natural study system to understand habitat selection as a response to ECEs. We used a 32-year study of the Eurasian oystercatcher (Haematopus ostralegus) to investigate whether habitat selection can lead to an increase in nest elevation and minimize the impacts of coastal flooding. The mean nest elevation of H. ostralegus has increased during the last three decades. We hypothesized that this change has been driven by changes in H. ostralegus territory settlement patterns over time. We compared various possible habitat selection cues to understand what information H. ostralegus might use to inform territory settlement. There was a clear relationship between elevation and territory settlement in H. ostralegus. In early years, settlements were more likely at low elevations but in more recent years the likelihood of settlement was similar between high and low elevation areas. Territory settlement was associated with conspecific fledgling output and conspecific density. Settlement was more likely in areas of high density and areas with high fledgling output. This study shows that habitat selection can minimize the effects of increasingly frequent ECEs. However, it seems unlikely that the changes we observe will fully alleviate the consequences of anthropogenic climate change. Rates of nest elevation increase were insufficient to track current increases in maximum high tide (0.5 vs. 0.8 cm/year). Furthermore, habitat selection cues that rely on information from previous breeding seasons (e.g. conspecific fledgling output) may become ineffective as ECEs become more frequent and environmental predictability is diminished. © 2019 The Authors.

Agriculture contributes to climate change by increasing GHG emissions, and climate change in turn affects agricultural production. In this paper, we calculated carbon emissions and sequestration of agriculture in the 142 counties of Hebei Province, China, and analyzed their spatiotemporal distributions during 2000–2010. Considering net carbon emissions as an undesirable output, we then measured low-carbon agricultural production efficiency using a stochastic directional distance function. We further explored the impacts of climate change on low-carbon agricultural production. We found that carbon emissions in agriculture increased by 15.85% (650 million tons) during 2000–2010, while carbon sequestration in agroecosystems increased by 33.82% (13.8 million tons). The annual average low-carbon agricultural production efficiency increased by 3.03%. There were distinct disparities of efficiency among cities, with the highest efficiency in Chengde and Shijiazhuang. The efficiency in southeastern areas was lower than that in the northwest, owing to the increased carbon emissions. Temperature and precipitation had a positive effect on efficiency in Hebei, whereas extreme weather events caused lower efficiency. The results provide valuable references for developing sustainable, climate-resilient and adaptive agriculture under changing climatic conditions. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agroecosystem; Carbon emission; Climate change; Hebei; Low-carbon agricultural production efficiency","Agriculture; Carbon; Ecosystems; Efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Stochastic systems; Agricultural productions; Agro ecosystems; Carbon emissions; Carbon sequestration; Directional distance function; Extreme weather events; Hebei; Spatiotemporal distributions; Climate change; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural production; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; climate change; greenhouse gas; precipitation (climatology); temperature; Chengde; China; Hebei; Shijiazhuang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045455762

Because they are directly contributing to human well-being, the realized ecosystem services are of particular socio-economic importance. A key challenge faced by the economic valuation of ecosystem services is how to differentiate between realized and potential ecosystem services. Here, we address this challenge for Southern Ontario, which is the most densely populated region of Canada. We apply the Co$ting Nature model to generate the combined spatial distribution and use intensity of a bundle of six ecosystem services: water provisioning and supply, water quality, carbon sequestration, carbon storage, flood regulation, and nature-based tourism. The relative distribution of the potential ecosystem services is then combined with region-specific unit values for the land covers supplying the ecosystem services. The unit values are expressed in 2017 Canadian dollars per hectare and per year. Our analysis yields a total potential value of the bundled ecosystem services of $19 billion per year for Southern Ontario. To estimate the value of the realized ecosystem services, the potential values are scaled by the corresponding relative use indices. The resulting value of the realized ecosystem services is $9.7 billion per year, that is, about 50% of the value of the potential ecosystem services. The importance of accounting for the use intensity of ecosystem services is illustrated for the Greenbelt, a protected area of about 7600 km2 surrounding the Greater Toronto-Hamilton conurbation, which is home to more than nine million people. Within the Greenbelt, 61% of the value of potential ecosystem services is realized, significantly higher than the regional average. Of particular importance is flood regulation by the Greenbelt, given the growing threat of urban flooding in the Toronto area. © 2019","Co$ting nature; Economic valuation; Greenbelt; Potential ecosystem services; Realized ecosystem services; Southern Ontario","carbon; agricultural land; Article; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; ecosystem; forest; geographic distribution; land use; Ontario; priority journal; suburban area; water quality; water supply; wetland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068127599

We performed the modeling of a hybrid microgrid system, followed by an economic analysis and sensitivity analysis to optimize the hybrid system design. We performed simulations based on the energy resources available (solar PV, wind, gasoline generator &amp; battery energy storage system) to satisfy the energy demands of the microbank, while the excess energy was supplied to meet the demand of the community loads, i.e. water pumping machine and rural home lighting. The results obtained showed that the hybrid system comprising the solar PV/battery/diesel was most techno-economically viable with a Net Present Cost (NPC) and Cost of Energy (COE) of $468,914 and 0.667$/kWh, respectively. Comparing these results with those obtained using analytical methods, the solar PV, battery and converter sizes obtained were slightly higher than the optimal system configurations as produced by HOMER.

Its biogeochemical impact on wetland functioning is strongly mediated by the microbiome associated with its roots. However, little is known about the structure and function of this WH rhizobiome and its relation to wetland ecosystem functioning. Here, we unveil the core and transient rhizobiomes of WH and their key biogeochemical functions in two of the world’s largest wetlands: the Amazon and the Pantanal. WH hosts a highly diverse microbial community shaped by spatiotemporal changes. Proteobacteria lineages were most common, followed by Actinobacteria and Planctomycetes. Deltaproteobacteria and Sphingobacteriia predominated in the core microbiome, potentially associated with polysaccharide degradation and fermentation of plant-derived carbon. Conversely, a plethora of lineages were transient, including highly abundant Acinetobacter, Acidobacteria subgroup 6, and methanotrophs, thus assuring diverse taxonomic signatures in the two different wetlands. Our findings point out that methanogenesis is a key driver of, and proxy for, community structure, especially during seasonal plant decline. We provide ecologically relevant insights into the WH microbiome, which is a key element linking plant-associated carbon turnover with other biogeochemical fluxes in tropical wetlands. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","16S rRNA; Eichhornia crassipes; Methane and nitrogen cycle; Rhizosphere; Root; Tropical wetland","bacterial DNA; carbon; RNA 16S; bacterium; classification; ecosystem; Eichhornia; genetics; isolation and purification; metabolism; microbiology; microflora; phylogeny; Bacteria; Carbon; DNA, Bacterial; Ecosystem; Eichhornia; Microbiota; Nutrients; Phylogeny; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061008687

The taxonomical and functional diversity of such soils can be a great source of information about microbial community and genes involved in petroleum hydrocarbon (PHC) degradation. In this study, microbial diversity of soils contaminated by RP from urban biome of Pune, India, and CP from agricultural biome of Gujarat, India, were assessed by 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing on Illumina MiSeq platform. Association between the soil microbial community and the physicochemical parameters were investigated for their potential role. In RP- and CP-contaminated soils, the microbiome analysis showed Proteobacteria as most dominant phylum followed by Actinobacteria. Interestingly, Firmicutes were most prevailing in a CP-contaminated sample while they were least prevailing in RP-contaminated soils. Soil moisture content, total organic carbon and organic nitrogen content influenced the taxa diversity in these soils. Species richness was more in RP as compared to CP soils. Further prediction of metagenome using PICRUSt revealed that the RP and CP soils contain microbial communities with excellent metabolic potential for PHC degradation. Microbial community contributing to genes essential for soil health improvement and plant growth promotion was also gauged.

We use dedicated zoom-in cosmological simulations with the hydrodynamical adaptive mesh refinement code RAMSES, which are evolved down to z = 0 and reach a maximum spatial resolution of 380 h-1 pc and a gas mass resolution up to 1.8 × 105 h -1Mθ in the densest regions. We compute the expected emission from the gas in the CGM using CLOUDY emissivity models for different lines (e.g. Lyα, CIV, OVI, CVI, OVIII) considering UV background fluorescence, gravitational cooling and continuum emission. In the case of Lyα, we additionally consider the scattering of continuum photons. We compare our predictions to current observations and find them to be in good agreement at any redshift after adjusting the Lyα escape fraction. We combine our mock observations with instrument models for Faint Intergalactic Redshifted Emission Balloon-2 (FIREBall-2; UV balloon spectrograph) and HARMONI (visible and NIR IFU on the ELT) to predict CGM observations with either instrument and optimize target selections and observing strategies. Our results show that Lyα emission from the CGM at a redshift of 0.7 will be observable with FIREBall-2 for bright galaxies (NUV∼18 mag), while metal lines like OVI and C IV will remain challenging to detect. HARMONI is found to be well suited to study the CGM at different redshifts with various tracers. © 2019 The Author(s).","Galaxies: Evolution; Galaxies: Formation; Intergalactic medium",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075163347

The advanced fitness for propulsion systems are the telemetry, navigation and electronic horizon systems in combination with connectivity functions. These smart systems are the key elements for increasing safety, congestion-free highways, reduced fuel consumption and emissions under real driving conditions. In this work, a novel optimization approach is presented to advise the driver economically to select battery charging and refueling stations as well as the quantities to be recharged or refueled. In this way, travel costs for a preselected route can be economically minimized and the EU driver rest period can be combined. When selecting the stations, the most cost-effective live charging and fueling tariffs are considered. The presented algorithm calculates the global optimal solution with discrete dynamic programming (DP) approach. The novel approach enables interaction with the preselected grids (V2G) and recommends reservations. The approach is applied to study the German highway Aachen-Munich-Aachen and Aachen-Friedrichshafen-Aachen routes. With the novel method, a reduction of more than 12 % of costs and 12 % of fuel consumption can be achieved. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Automobile drivers; Charging (batteries); Cost effectiveness; Decision making; Dynamic programming; Intelligent systems; Intelligent vehicle highway systems; Propulsion; Vehicle-to-grid; Connectivity function; Cost effective; Driver assistance system; Global optimal solutions; Horizon systems; Innovative solutions; Optimization approach; Propulsion system; Secondary batteries",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076799117

We applied G'DAY, a process-based ecophysiological model, to simulate carbon and water budgets and stem biomass production of Eucalyptus plantations in São Paulo State, Brazil. Our main objective was to assess the drivers of spatial variability in plantation production at regional scale. We followed a multi-site calibration approach: the model was first parameterized using a detailed experimental dataset. Then a subset of the parameters were re-calibrated on two independent experimental datasets. An additional genotype-specific calibration of a subset of parameters was performed. Model predictions of key carbon-related variables (e.g., gross primary production, leaf area index and stem biomass) and key water-related variables (e.g., plant available water and evapotranspiration) agreed closely with measurements. Application of the model across ca. 27,500 ha of forests planted with different genotypes of Eucalyptus indicated that the model was able to capture 89% of stem biomass variability measured at different ages. Several factors controlling Eucalyptus production variability in time and space were grouped in three categories: soil, climate, and the planted genotype. Modelling analysis showed that calibrating the model for genotypic differences was critical for stem biomass prediction at regional scale, but that taking into account climate and soil variability significantly improved the results. We conclude that application of process-based models at regional scale can be used for accurate predictions of Eucalyptus production, provided that an accurate calibration of the model for key genotype-specific parameters is conducted. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Ecophysiological model; Eucalyptus plantations; G'DAY; Optimization; Productivity","Biomass; Budget control; Calibration; Carbon; Forecasting; Forestry; Optimization; Productivity; Soils; Ecophysiological modeling; Eucalyptus plantations; G'DAY; Genotypic differences; Gross primary production; Multi-site calibration; Process-based models; Spatial variability; Climate models; biomass; carbon balance; climate effect; dicotyledon; ecological modeling; genotype; leaf area index; optimization; plantation forestry; spatial variation; water budget; Biomass; Calibration; Carbon; Cost Control; Forecasts; Forestry; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068962869

This paper establishes a stochastic approach to conceptualize the air pollution control model to attain a sustainable solution. The model is formulated for decision makers to select the least costly treatment method using linear programming with a defined objective function and multi-constraints. Furthermore, an integrated fuzzy based risk assessment approach is applied to examine uncertainties and evaluate an ambient air quality systematically. The applicability of the optimized model is explored through an open-pit metal mine case study, in North America. This method also incorporates the meteorological data as input to accommodate the local conditions. The uncertainties in the inputs, and predicted concentration are accomplished by probabilistic analysis using Monte Carlo simulation method. The output results are obtained to select the cost-effective pollution control technologies for PM25, PM10, NOx, SO2 and greenhouse gases. The risk level is divided into three types (loose, medium and strict) using a triangular fuzzy membership approach based on different environmental guidelines. Fuzzy logic is then used to identify environmental risk through stochastic simulated cumulative distribution functions of pollutant concentration.

The main challenge with this process lies in the management of the generated residues, namely, air pollution control (APC) lime, fly ash, and bottom ash. In this study, a novel approach is explored that could potentially allow using incineration energy and residues to produce an ecological cement (eco-cement) at a low synthesis temperature (1100 °C) with the ability to achieve structural binding strength when reacted with carbon dioxide. It was found that eco-cement made exclusively from residues (100%) had shown low early strength by carbonation activation and was more latent hydraulic. With 6% virgin additives, eco-cement could develop a strength of 55 MPa by 2 h carbonation, which was comparable to the performance of control ordinary Portland cement (OPC) hydrated for 28 days. Leaching tests validated the stability of the product, where concentrations of monitored heavy metals in the leachate solution were all well under regulatory limits. In the near future, eco-cement could possibly be produced within MSW incinerators by making use of abundantly generated heat for clinkering raw meals prepared from incineration residues. As a further step, concrete made from such cement could also be activated by carbon dioxide captured locally from emission stacks, thereby reducing an operation's carbon footprint and effectively diverting carbon emissions from the atmosphere. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon sequestration; Eco-cement; MSWI residues; Municipal solid waste incineration; Resource conservation; Waste recycling","Air pollution; Air pollution control; Ash handling; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Cement additives; Conservation; Fly ash; Heavy metals; Lime; Municipal solid waste; Natural resources; Portland cement; Strength of materials; Carbon sequestration; Eco-cement; MSWI residues; Resource conservation; Waste recycling; Waste incineration; carbon dioxide; cement; ecocement; unclassified drug; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; cement (construction material); incineration; municipal solid waste; recycling; waste management; Article; carbon footprint; carbonation; chemical composition; chemical reaction; combustion; compressive strength; concentration (parameter); environmental sustainability; incineration; landfill; leaching; municipal solid waste; process monitoring; recycling; stoichiometry; temperature sensitivity; X ray fluorescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067367254

Understanding the adaptations being practiced and factors which determine decision in adoption is vital in designing viable strategies. A cross-sectional survey research design was employed to collect data from 384 randomly selected smallholder farmers to identify adaptation measures being undertaken and to estimate the prominent determinants in the adoption of adaptations in drought-prone areas of north-central Ethiopia. Data were analyzed using percentage, weighted mean index, Chi-square test, t test and multinomial regression model and triangulated with thematic analysis. Around 96% of the respondents have perceived a change in climate and 65.4% employed adaptation measures. Stone/soil bund, changing the farming calendar and switching to short maturing varieties are the most widely practiced adaptations. Barriers inhibiting smallholder farmers from taking adaptation measures were financial constraint, lack of affordable technologies, lack of knowledge, limited access to early warning, uncertainty about the future, shortage of land and scarcity of water. The results from the multinomial discrete choice model revealed that age and educational level of the head, family size, herd size, access to training, access to microfinance, extension services, remittance and perceiving that climate change can be adapted influenced the selection of adaptations. Overcoming financial constraint, strengthening extension service, providing timely information and early warning, intensifying irrigation, integration of non-farm sources of livelihood in the farming system and land resource management would enable to enhance the adaptive capacity of smallholder farmers. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media B.V., part of Springer Nature.","Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Climate change; Coping strategies; Multinomial logit model; Smallholder agriculture","adaptive management; climate change; coping strategy; farming system; rainfed agriculture; resource management; smallholder; strategic approach; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045055994

In this scenario, agroforestry is one of the best alternatives to cope with climate change and disaster risks. However, the agroforestry approaches adopted in the past were sectoral and partial, and were insufficient to contribute to socio-economic wellbeing and resilient communities. Nepal has been implementing package-based integrated agroforestry since 2016. It is a project approach to advance agroforestry practices by including disaster mitigation, land and water management, and community development activities. This paper reflects on the process and outcomes of the agroforestry practices, implemented by the government in seven super zones of Nepal. The programs have shown fairly satisfactory output in building adaptive capacity to climate change, awareness and active participation in agroforestry development activities. This paper reveals that the agroforestry alone cannot be sustained, and hence, it has to be integrated with land productivity enhancement, natural resource management, climate change adaptation, and livelihood support in addition to tree plantation in agricultural lands. This paper is crucial in understanding the scope of package-based integrated agroforestry approach to build climate resilient communities. © 2019 by the authors.","Agroforestry Systems; Climate Change Adaptation; Resilient Communities; Super Zone Development Program; Water and Land Management",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081695397

Data were gathered during hot summer days, using mobile observations and a questionnaire. The results showed that the cooling effect of this urban park of 125 ha area at a distance of 150 m could reduce air temperatures by an average of 0.63 °C and 1.28 °C for distances of 380 m and 665 meters from the park. Moreover, the degree of the physiological equivalent temperature (PET) index at a distance of 150 meters from the park is on average 2 °C PET and 2.3 °C PET less compared to distances of 380 m and 665 m, respectively. Considering the distance from the park, the correlation between occupant perceived thermal comfort (PTC) and PET is inverse. That is, augmenting the distance from the park increases PET, while the extent of PTC reduces accordingly. The correlation between these two factors at the nearest and furthest distances from the park is meaningful (p-value < 0.05). The results also showed that large-scale urban parks generally play a significant part in creating a cognitive state of high-perceived thermal comfort spaces for residents. © 2019 by the authors.","Air temperature; Climate change mitigation and adaptation; Cooling effect; Global warming; Perceived thermal comfort; Physiological equivalent temperature; Smart cities; Sustainable cities; Sustainable urban development; Thermal comfort; Urban green spaces; Urban health; Urban heat island; Urban park; Urban resilience","Cooling systems; Global warming; Physiology; Smart city; Thermal comfort; Urban growth; Air temperature; Climate change mitigation; Cooling effects; Physiological equivalent temperatures; Sustainable cities; Sustainable urban development; Urban green spaces; Urban health; Urban heat island; Urban parks; Urban resilience; Atmospheric temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074990704

The flexible CO2 wave-guide laser has been developed and commercially available for several years. However, the transnasal use of CO2 flexible wave-guided laser surgery through the instrument channel of a flexible endoscope (CO2 TNFLS) is not permitted in Japan. This feasibility study aimed to assess the value and the safety of an in-office CO2 TNFLS procedure. Methods: Patients with small laryngopharyngeal diseases were enrolled from June 2015. Eligible patients had indications with lesions generally localized superficial lesions such as the benign tumor, leukoplakia, and premalignant lesion-like carcinoma in situ (CIS). Patients were locally well anesthetized using xylocaine. After removing as much of the lesion(s) as possible with flexible forceps, the remainder of the lesions were evaporated using CO2 TNFLS through the instrument channel of a flexible endoscope under local anesthesia. Results: Eighteen surgeries involving 13 patients, including 9 papilloma (7 recurrent respiratory papilloma [RRP]), 2 carcinoma in situ, 1 leukoplakia, and 1 large epiglottic cyst), were performed. Four patients with RRP required multiple surgeries. Except for 3 patients with RRP, all patients achieved disease control without additional intervention. All procedures were completed with no severe adverse events. Conclusion: Office-based CO2 TNFLS is safe and feasible for patients with laryngopharyngeal pathologies. It is especially valuable for RRP patients with small lesions to avoid surgery under general anesthesia. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Fiber guided CO2laser; In office surgery; Larynx; Pharynx; Recurrent respiratory papilloma; Transnasal flexible CO2 wave-guide laser surgery","lidocaine; adult; aged; Article; benign respiratory tract tumor; carcinoma in situ; clinical article; clinical effectiveness; epiglottic cyst; epiglottis tumor; feasibility study; female; general anesthesia; human; laryngopharyngeal lesion; laser surgery; leukoplakia; local anesthesia; male; middle aged; patient safety; pharynx disease; respiratory papilloma; transnasal flexible carbon dioxide laser surgery; treatment outcome; very elderly; ambulatory surgery; carcinoma in situ; cyst; drug therapy; ear nose throat surgery; epiglottis; gas laser; larynx disorder; larynx tumor; leukoplakia; low level laser therapy; natural orifice transluminal endoscopic surgery; nose cavity; papillomavirus infection; pharynx cancer; pharynx disease; procedures; respiratory tract infection; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ambulatory Surgical Procedures; Anesthesia, Local; Carcinoma in Situ; Cysts; Epiglottis; Feasibility Studies; Female; Humans; Laryngeal Diseases; Laryngeal Neoplasms; Laser Therapy; Lasers, Gas; Leukoplakia; Male; Middle Aged; Nasal Cavity; Natural Orifice Endoscopic Surgery; Otorhinolaryngologic Surgical Procedures; Papillomavirus Infections; Pharyngeal Diseases; Pharyngeal Neoplasms; Respiratory Tract Infections; Treatment Outcome",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85061272265

Major auto emissions, particulate matter, are critical road transport emissions that threaten human health and the environment but are often excluded from policy discussions. In Ghana, vehicle acquisition schemes are not environmentally friendly and current national policies have alienated the monitoring of airborne emissions from the transport sector. This calls for the design and implementation of green transport and fuel economy options. We discuss the critical role of motor vehicle particulates in Ghana and propose policy solutions for sustainable urban mobility. We have shown that environmental remediation, social equity and sustainability can only be achieved when transport emissions are properly integrated in a coordinated transport policy. Ghana has a National Transport Policy that recognizes the challenges of environmental pollution due to vehicular emissions and uneconomic fuel consumption. There are green fuel policy proposals and a vehicle testing and licensing regime that is largely driven by mechanical and electrical functionality. Auto-vehicle emissions performance standards have not been developed and technical capacity for emissions testing is lacking. Ambient air monitoring is limited to particulate matter which is not nationally representative as it is confined to Greater Accra Region at only 15 sites. 77% of road users believe 20% of all cars in urban centres visibly exude fumes. Noise pollution and vehicular emissions were reported at 78% and 75% of 160 respondents respectively. Vehicle owners, drivers and driver unions are apprehensive of electric cars but would welcome a reliable, convenient and efficient mass transport system. Abatement strategies to reduce vehicular emissions particulates will require integrated solutions and inter-agency collaboration among regulatory institutions. The Environmental Protection Agency and Driver and Vehicle Licensing Authority should be empowered to develop emissions performance standards and conduct real time monitoring of particulates with the assistance of the Motor Traffic and Transport Department of the Ghana Police Service. It is further recommended that volatile organic compounds, particularly benzene series contaminants, should be monitored by the Agency. Further research on vehicular emissions of volatile organic compounds and their health effects on road users should be carried out to understand the full impact of exposure of on-road emissions. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Fuel economy; Ghana; Particulate matter; Sustainable transport; Urban mobility","Air pollution control; Air quality; Automobile testing; Developing countries; Driver licensing; Environmental Protection Agency; Fuel economy; Fuels; Motor transportation; Noise pollution; Particles (particulate matter); Roads and streets; Sustainable development; Traction motors; Urban transportation; Vehicle performance; Volatile organic compounds; Ambient air monitoring; Design and implementations; Environmental pollutions; Environmental remediation; Inter-agency collaboration; Mechanical and electrical; National transport policy; Road transport emissions; Particulate emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100779946

Research and development efforts have been focused on devising novel concepts, low-cost systems, and reliable electric/fuel cell powertrain. In fact, electric and fuel cell vehicles coupled with low-carbon electricity sources offer the potential for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and exposure to tailpipe emissions from personal transportation. In particular, Pedal Assisted Bicycles popularity is rising in urban areas due to their low energy consumption and environmental impact. In fact, when electrically moved, they are zero emission vehicles with very low noise emissions, as well. These positive characteristics could be even improved by coupling a PAB with a fuel cell based power generation system, thus increasing the vehicle autonomy without influencing their emissions and consumption performances. In this paper, four types of vehicles are compared from an environmental and accessibility point of view: Conventional car, bus, electric PAB and hydrogen fuel cell PAB; for such vehicles, the respective utilization stages are accounted for, i.e. without considering the manufacturing process. The analysis has been carried out comparing different vehicles performance along different routes of an Italian middle-size city, Viterbo, which represents a very good pilot case as its Municipality is adopting many solutions suggested by European Union through the planning tool called Sustainable Energy Action Plan. The comparison is based on an ad-hoc developed mathematical procedure, which includes environmental (greenhouse gas and air pollution emissions), health (pollutants toxicity levels) and accessibility time (waiting times) indicators. According to this analysis, electric and fuel cell PAB exhibit interesting advantages over the other vehicles. However, the global economic efficiency of electric or fuel cell apparatus depends substantially on the exploited source of electrical energy. © 2019 SAE International.

The aerodynamic gradient method (ADM) is commonly used to measure fumigant and pesticide emissions. However, the ADM may over estimate emissions compared to other micrometeorological and modeling approaches, which would increase uncertainty over the true flux estimate. Different studies with ADM have also used multiple differing transport functions that relate concentration gradients to emissions. Therefore, we tested different and more recent transport functions to try to correct the anticipated observed higher values with ADM using observations from two sites in California, USA. We evaluated different transport functions against eddy covariance observations and found that using the functions developed by Högström (1996) corrected the ADM values to be in line with other observational methods. For the Fresno experiment, cumulative emission masses from the ADM- Högström functions were within 7% of other approaches while the Pruitt function was >15% higher. Applying the Högström functions to a series of previous fumigation experiments in California saw reductions in the ADM observations of >25% for cumulative mass emissions. The results indicate that the Högström functions should be used for future ADM experiments in the absence of more robust transport factors for local meteorological conditions. The results also illustrate how previous ADM observations could be corrected to reduce uncertainty in flux emissions estimates. © 2019","1,3-dichloropropene; Aerodynamic gradient method; Eddy covariance; Fumigants; Pesticides","Aerodynamics; Atmospheric movements; Fumigation; Gradient methods; Pesticides; 1 ,3-Dichloropropene; Aerodynamic gradients; Concentration gradients; Cumulative emissions; Eddy covariance; Fumigants; Meteorological condition; Observational method; Uncertainty analysis; fumigant; aerodynamics; concentration (composition); eddy covariance; fumigant; organochlorine pesticide; pesticide residue; public health; Article; California; controlled study; Eddy covariance; environmental impact assessment; environmental protection; environmental temperature; meteorological phenomena; meteorology; priority journal; soil fumigation; time series analysis; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067227927

The goal of this model is to simulate permafrost thaw rates, understand the significant effects of climate change on permafrost, and assess the reciprocal effects of permafrost thaw on climate. In order to simulate permafrost over time spans of several years, a robust and efficient model is required. In the present setting, the heat transfer problem is converted to a minimization problem, in which we minimize a potential function that characterizes the governing heat transfer PDE within a time discrete framework. The use of the trust region minimization algorithm proves desirable due to the highly non-linear energy functional which also involves non-convex terms induced by phase change. Results obtained show satisfactory agreement with existing analytical solutions. Moreover, the grid and time step convergence studies conducted to examine the dependence of the solution on mesh and time step sizes indicate robust convergence rates. This is the first application of trust region energy minimization algorithm in permafrost simulation. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Finite element method; Heat transfer; Non-isothermal; Permafrost thaw; Phase change; Trust region","climate change; climate effect; finite element method; heat transfer; numerical model; permafrost; thawing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068766389

While it is essential to understand the temporal dynamics of urban forest structure as well as its services and contribution to human wellbeing in cities, it has hardly ever been examined whether the future contributions of these services after different possible planting strategies can comply with climate change policy goals; these are topics rarely discussed in urban planning and management. In this paper, the ecosystem services currently provided by urban trees (through carbon sequestration and storage), as well as those potentially provided in the future, were quantified using the i-Tree Eco model, and their contribution to climate change mitigation was evaluated. As a case study in Tabriz, Iran, we developed four possible scenarios. Synergy (urban temperature regulation by UF) and trade-off (tree water requirements) were also analyzed. Future carbon sequestration and storage potential of urban trees was compared with the estimated future carbon emissions. The current contribution in Tabriz is relatively modest (about 0.2%), but it can be tripled through long-term tree planting strategies. Additionally, the temporal cooling effects and tree water requirements increase as climate change mitigation improves through tree planting. We conclude that urban tree planting has a small impact on carbon mitigation in the study area, most likely because of the young age of trees in Tabriz as well as the fact that the planted trees cannot deliver all their benefits over a 20-years period and need more time. Thus, the use of urban trees serves only as a complementary solution rather than an alternative climate mitigation strategy. Our quantitative approach helps urban environmental policymakers to evaluate how much they can rely on urban forest strategies to achieve climate change mitigation targets. © 2019, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon storage and sequestration; Greenhouse gas emissions; I-tree eco; Synergy; Trade-off; Urban forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068331475

We studied the effects of cell-specific IDO1 expression in the epithelium at baseline and during intestinal inflammation in mice. Methods: We generated transgenic mice that overexpress fluorescence-tagged IDO1 in the intestinal epithelium under control of the villin promoter (IDO1-TG). We generated intestinal epithelial spheroids from mice with full-length Ido1 (controls), disruption of Ido1 (knockout mice), and IDO1-TG and analyzed them for stem cell and differentiation markers by real-time polymerase chain reaction, immunoblotting, and immunofluorescence. Some mice were gavaged with enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (E2348/69) to induce infectious ileitis, and ileum contents were quantified by polymerase chain reaction. Separate sets of mice were given dextran sodium sulfate or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid to induce colitis; intestinal tissues were analyzed by histology. We utilized published data sets GSE75214 and GDS2642 of RNA expression data from ilea of healthy individuals undergoing screening colonoscopies (controls) and patients with Crohn's disease. Results: Histologic analysis of small intestine tissues from IDO1-TG mice revealed increases in secretory cells. Enteroids derived from IDO1-TG intestine had increased markers of stem, goblet, Paneth, enteroendocrine, and tuft cells, compared with control enteroids, with a concomitant decrease in markers of absorptive cells. IDO1 interacted non-enzymatically with the aryl hydrocarbon receptor to inhibit activation of NOTCH1. Intestinal mucus layers from IDO1-TG mice were 2-fold thicker than mucus layers from control mice, with increased proportions of Akkermansia muciniphila and Mucispirillum schaedleri. Compared to controls, IDO1-TG mice demonstrated an 85% reduction in ileal bacteria (P = .03) when challenged with enteropathogenic E coli, and were protected from immune infiltration, crypt dropout, and ulcers following administration of dextran sodium sulfate or 2,4,6-trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid. In ilea of Crohn's disease patients, increased expression of IDO1 correlated with increased levels of MUC2, LYZ1, and aryl hydrocarbon receptor, but reduced levels of SLC2A5. Conclusions: In mice, expression of IDO1 in the intestinal epithelial promotes secretory cell differentiation and mucus production; levels of IDO1 are positively correlated with secretory cell markers in ilea of healthy individuals and Crohn's disease patients. We propose that IDO1 contributes to intestinal homeostasis. © 2019 AGA Institute","Kynurenine; Metabolism; Microbiome; Organoids; Ulcerative Colitis","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; ido1 protein; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1; Notch receptor; protein; RNA; unclassified drug; villin; AHR protein, human; Ahr protein, mouse; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; basic helix loop helix transcription factor; IDO1 protein, mouse; indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase; indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, human; Notch receptor; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; cell differentiation; cell specificity; controlled study; enteritis; epithelium cell; Escherichia coli infection; female; gene overexpression; human; human tissue; male; microflora; mouse; mucus; nonhuman; Notch signaling; priority journal; promoter region; secretory cell; transgenic mouse; tumor spheroid; animal; bacterium; case control study; cell line; cell lineage; disease model; enzymology; genetics; genotype; inflammatory bowel disease; intestine flora; intestine mucosa; knockout mouse; metabolism; microbiology; pathology; phenotype; secretory pathway; signal transduction; stem cell; Animals; Bacteria; Basic Helix-Loop-Helix Transcription Factors; Case-Control Studies; Cell Differentiation; Cell Line; Cell Lineage; Disease Models, Animal; Epithelial Cells; Gastrointestinal Microbiome; Genotype; Humans; Indoleamine-Pyrrole 2,3,-Dioxygenase; Inflammatory Bowel Diseases; Intestinal Mucosa; Mice, Knockout; Phenotype; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Receptors, Notch; Secretory Pathway; Signal Transduction; Stem Cells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072546855

One system is the passive downdraught evaporative cooling (PDEC) tower. PDEC captures hot, dry winds at the top of a tower and then cools the air by passing it through or over water. This cooler air then flows out from the base of the tower into the building. In this study, a PDEC system in a small Saudi public library was monitored for two summer months. A key aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between local wind speed and direction and the performance of the PDEC towers. A thermal comfort analysis investigated the acceptability limits of indoor temperature using the adaptive thermal comfort model. A parametric analysis of the wind effects was conducted by grouping wind data in to ranges of wind speed and direction and then correlating them against environmental conditions in the library. The results indicated that the PDEC towers could deliver significant cooling for library users. However, the towers’ effectiveness was influenced by changes in wind speed, and in a counter intuitive way – stronger wind speeds tended to reduce the tower cooling efficiency. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The objectives were to assess the system viability in a location of moderate-to-high-temperature solar availability to sCO2 power block during the day and to investigate the role of thermal energy storage with 4, 8, 12, and 16 h of storage to increase the solar share and the yearly energy generating capacity. A case study of system optimization and evaluation is presented in a city in Saudi Arabia (Riyadh). To achieve the highest energy production per unit cost, the heliostat geometry field design integrated with a sCO2 Brayton cycle with a molten-salt thermal energy storage (TES) dispatch system and the corresponding operating parameters are optimized. A solar power tower (SPT) is a type of CSP system that is of particular interest in this research because it can operate at relatively high temperatures. The present SPT-TES field comprises of heliostat field mirrors, a solar tower, a receiver, heat exchangers, and two molten-salt TES tanks. The main thermoeconomic indicators are the capacity factor and the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE). The research findings indicate that SPT-TES with a supercritical CO2 power cycle is economically viable with 12 h thermal storage using molten salt. The results also show that integrating 12 h-TES with an SPT has a high positive impact on the capacity factor of 60% at the optimum LCOE of $0.1078/kW h. © 2019 by ASME.","Brayton cycle; CO2; heat exchanger; heliostat field; recompression sCO2 cycle; solar energy; supercritical carbon dioxide; TES molten salt","Carbon dioxide; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Fused salts; Heat exchangers; Heat storage; Solar energy; Solar water heaters; Supercritical fluid extraction; Thermal energy; Concentrated solar power; Heliostat field; Levelized cost of electricities; Molten salt; Recompression; Solar power towers (SPT); Supercritical carbon dioxides; System optimizations; Brayton cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065247889

The main objectives of this study were to collect renewable energy resource data of a hybrid hospital, use the average amount of hospital waste from the literature and NASA surface meteorology in addition to the solar energy database from HOMER Pro software to construct a hybrid model for a conceptual hospital in the new green city in Saudi Arabia, NEOM. The hybrid model consisted of biogas cofire and diesel generators, PV solar array and batteries. Simulations were performed to analyse the load requirements of a standalone hospital. The mechanism of energy storage was designed based on Tesla batteries. Then, the hybrid hospital model was tested with NEOM's natural resources, load demand of 250 kWh/day and the average amount of daily hospital waste of 0.6 tons based on the literature data. This condition allows the smart hospital to be tested with real features. The outcome of the COE, NPC and the amount of reduction of carbon dioxide in the hybrid hospital were analysed. Many of the hybrid properties and constraints that define the hospital were adopted from previous literature concentrating on similar domains. The optimal solution of a hybrid micro grid consisted of biogas cofire, PV array, and batteries. Of the total load demand, 32.3% and 67.6% were produced by PV array and biogas cofire generators, respectively, together with eight Tesla PowerWall2.0 batteries. The cost of energy was 0.21 USD/kWh and the net present cost was 243,699.17 USD. In this study, we compared renewable energy with conventional energy and found that the optimal solution would be able to reduce carbon emission and diesel consumption by almost 84% and 81%, respectively.

To provide policy direction in achieving the emission targets, this study investigated the drivers essential to attaining the Sustainable Development Goals in regards to reducing environmental pollution in EU member countries. A balanced panel of 16-EU countries from 1997 to 2014 was estimated with Panel Pool Mean Group Autoregressive distributive lag (PMG-ARDL) model. The study traced the equilibrium relationship between ecological footprint, real gross domestic product, trade openness, fertility rate, renewable and non-renewable energy consumption — suggested by both Kao and Pedroni cointegration tests. The PMG-ARDL analysis confirmed the role of non-renewable energy consumption in depleting environmental quality while renewable energy consumption was found to improve environmental sustainability. Interestingly, the unexpected long-run fertility-ecological footprint nexus was connected with the divergent fertility rate information of the EU member countries. Although, country-specific policy approach is essential, however, such a framework should be compatible with the region's overall Sustainable Development Goals. The call for diversification of existing energy portfolios by either incorporating or enhancing renewable energy technologies is essential to sustain the current success strides of most member states.

In this work, we report experimental observations of femtosecond laser irradiation on SWCNTs, in order to process and join them through an efficient and cost-effective technique. The nanotubes were deagglomerated in ethanol by an ultrasonicator and thin slurries of SWCNTs were spread evenly on glass substrates. A laser micromachining workstation for laboratory FemtoLAB (workshop of photonics) has been employed to irradiate the different SWCNTs film samples. The effect of laser parameters, such as pulse wavelength, laser power, etc., were systematically tuned to see the possibility of joining the SWCNTs ropes. Several experiments have been performed to optimize the parameters on different samples of SWCNTs. In general, the nanotubes were mostly damaged by the infrared (1st harmonics femtosecond laser) irradiation on the focal plane. However, the less damaging effect was observed for second harmonics (green wavelength) irradiation. The results suggest some joining of nanotubes along the sides of the focus plane, as well as on the center at the brink of nanotubes.

However, smart grid technology brings new challenges to the big data management of the new power system construction. Additionally, due to the large-scale intermittent distributed renewable resources contribution and stochastic electric vehicles integration, the current energy management systems must undergo some improvements to handle the smart grid requirements.

Unanticipated climate-induced surges in peak load can lead to supply shortages causing frequent brownouts and blackouts, and large-scale socioeconomic impacts. In this paper, the climate sensitivity of daily peak load is characterized by leveraging advanced statistical machine learning algorithms. More specifically, a rigorously tested and validated predictive model based on the Bayesian additive regression trees algorithm is proposed. Results from this study revealed that maximum daily temperature followed by mean dew point temperature are the most important predictors of the climate-sensitive portion of daily peak load. Among the non-climatic predictors, electricity price was found to have a strong positive association with the daily peak load. Economic growth was observed to have an inverse association with the daily peak load. While the proposed framework is established for the state of Texas, one of the most energy-intensive states with geographic and demographic susceptibility to climatic change, the methodology can be extended to other states/regions. The model can also be used to make short-term predictions of the climate-sensitive portion of daily peak load. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Climate sensitive peak-load; Dew point temperature; Predictive energy analytics; Statistical learning theory","Climate models; Economics; Inverse problems; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Trees (mathematics); Bayesian additive regression trees; Dewpoint temperature; Peak load; Power systems planning; Predictive energy analytics; Socio-economic impacts; Statistical learning theory; Statistical machine learning; Electric power system planning; algorithm; Bayesian analysis; climate change; dew point; economic growth; electricity; energy planning; environmental assessment; operations technology; power generation; prediction; sensitivity analysis; socioeconomic impact; statistical analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069654114

However, biodiversity–ecosystem function (BEF) relationships may be fundamentally different across dense-wooded and light-wooded species, as they are clustered at two opposite extremes of the wood economics spectrum. Here we analyzed BEF relationships through mediations of functional dominance (i.e. community-weighted mean, CWM) and functional divergence (FDvar) of plant maximum height (H) while accounting for the effects of other characteristics of homegardens, across dense-wooded, light-wooded and all species, by using structural equation modelling (SEM) on 45 homegarden agroforestry systems in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The dense-wooded SEM accounted for 69% variation in aboveground biomass through significant positive direct effects of CWM H (β = 0.51) and FDvar H (β = 0.20), and indirect effect of species diversity via FDvar H on aboveground biomass (β = 0.12). Although the light-wooded SEM accounted for 19% variation in aboveground biomass, the BEF relationships were non-significant. Regardless of SEMs, FDvar H but not CWM H was significantly positively related to species diversity. None of the BEF relationships was statistically significant when dense-wooded and light-wooded species were mixed. From a theoretical aspect, these positive BEF relationships are driven by both dominant and complementarity dense-wooded species. From a practical aspect, the positive BEF relationships support the feasibility of UN Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+) initiative in studied agroforests, which aims to enhance carbon storage in aboveground biomass while conserving biodiversity. Hence, this study suggests that wood density is a potential sustainability indicator for better management of agroforest-ecosystem while driving positive BEF relationships. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Agroforestry; Ecological indicators; Functional diversity; Functional dominance; Wood economics spectrum","Biodiversity; Biomass; Deforestation; Ecosystems; Hardwoods; Sustainable development; Above ground biomass; Agroforestry; Agroforestry system; Ecological indicators; Functional diversity; Functional dominance; Structural equation modelling (SEM); Sustainability indicators; Environmental protection; aboveground biomass; agroforestry; arid region; biodiversity; complementarity; deforestation; dominance; ecosystem function; ecosystem management; emission inventory; environmental indicator; functional change; home garden; niche; spectrum; sustainability; wood",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045547185

Therefore, climate change mitigation demands a fundamental transformation in the Urban Energy Systems (UES), energy markets and energy policies. In this context, the large shift to micro-generation from renewable energy sources and their integration in the current energy system are a technical challenge for future energy systems design and operation. This will be further exacerbated if flexibilisation technologies such as storage are not efficiently integrated. For this purpose, an accurate modelling and representation of UES requires the characterisation of different urban energy requirements. These requirements, along with the urban fabric of cities, should be adequately incorporated in a spatial-temporal framework including both static and dynamic datasets. In this context, urban energy models provide policymakers with qualitative and quantitative insights for the planning of future UES. Within this framework, urban energy models integrated in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) will play an important role due to their multi-layer approach. This study introduces an open source GIS-based platform called FlexiGIS for the optimisation of energy systems in cities. FlexiGIS is used in this contribution to optimally allocate distributed battery storage in urban areas. The FlexiGIS platform provides the urban energy infrastructure (spatial dimension), simulates electricity consumption and generation (spatial and temporal dimension) and performs a linear optimisation for the economic deployment of micro-generation and decentralised storage under different energy scenarios. The first case study considers the city as a single system or ‘energy cell’, while the second one assumes that the city is divided into connected subsystems or districts. The total UES costs and required storage capacities for the investigated scenarios are obtained using optimisation. A key finding is that, for the investigated scenarios, investing in local electricity storage and renewable power generation can significantly reduce the total system costs and increase urban self-sufficiency. This study also highlights that the off-grid scenario (isolated city) is not an optimal choice. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Flexibility options; FlexiGIS platform; Geographic Information Systems (GIS); Open source data; OpenStreetMap (OSM); Urban Energy Systems (UES)","Climate change; Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Energy policy; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Information systems; Information use; Linear programming; Open systems; Renewable energy resources; Urban planning; Flexibility options; FlexiGIS platform; Open source datum; OpenStreetMap (OSM); Urban energy systems; Geographic information systems; alternative energy; climate change; cost analysis; database; energy policy; energy storage; energy use; GIS; greenhouse gas; operations technology; optimization; policy making; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066476444

This paper investigates energy consumption in residential type A villa buildings constructed by the Ministry of Housing. The study specifically investigates energy consumption of a case building in three climate zones of the country identified in the KSA Building Code (SBC-602E). The software package IES-ve was used to simulate power consumption of the case building taking into account the climate characteristics of each zone. In total 6 cities were considered from the three zones to evaluate and compare annual and monthly power consumption loads of the building. It was found that there is some distinction of energy consumption for heating and cooling in the three zones (e.g., peak monthly power energy consumption for cooling varied from 6.371 MWh in Riyadh (zone1) to 1.663 MWh in Abha (zone3) and no heating requirement for Jaddah (zone 1) while Turaif (zone 3) heating consumption is 23.835 MWh) however, further work is required to identify clearer the climate specifications within each zone to address the excess energy consumption of this type of buildings. © 2019 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In this study, we identify two plausible bioenergy production pathways for bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) based on centralized and distributed energy systems to show what BECCS could look like if deployed by 2050 in Great Britain. The extent of agricultural land available to sustainably produce biomass feedstock in the centralized and distributed energy systems is about 0.39 and 0.5 Mha, providing approximately 5.7 and 7.3 MtDM/year of biomass respectively. If this land-use change occurred, bioenergy crops would contribute to reduced agricultural soil GHG emission by 9 and 11 MtCO2eq/year in the centralized and distributed energy systems respectively. In addition, bioenergy crops can contribute to reduce agricultural soil ammonia emissions and water pollution from soil nitrate leaching, and to increase soil organic carbon stocks. The technical mitigation potentials from BECCS lead to projected CO2 reductions of approximately 18 and 23 MtCO2/year from the centralized and distributed energy systems respectively. This suggests that the domestic supply of sustainable biomass would not allow the emission reduction target of 50 MtCO2/year from BECCS to be met. To meet that target, it would be necessary to produce solid biomass from forest systems on 0.59 or 0.49 Mha, or alternatively to import 8 or 6.6 MtDM/year of biomass for the centralized and distributed energy system respectively. The spatially explicit results of this study can serve to identify the regional differences in the potential capture of CO2 from BECCS, providing the basis for the development of onshore CO2 transport infrastructures. © 2019 The Authors.

Using mobile conversion technologies that can operate in remote areas and are capable of converting forest residues into high quality energy products can address the issues associated with its valorization for renewable energy production. This study evaluated environmental sustainability of using an integrated novel system of semi-mobile biomass conversion technologies (BCTs) to utilize low-value forest residue biomass as high value bioenergy products. A cradle-to-grave life cycle assessment (LCA) and resource use assessment on a unit-process level was conducted for two bio-products: nontorrefied briquettes (NTB) and torrefied briquettes (TOB). Their use for production of useful thermal energy in wood stoves for domestic heating and electricity at power plants were investigated along with their alternatives. The analyses were performed with SimaPro 8.5 using the DATASMART database. The impact assessment results showed a notable decrease in global warming (GW) impact when substituting fossil fuels with these two bio-products. Specifically, for domestic heating on an equivalent energy basis, a 50% substitution of propane with NTB and TOB showed GHG emission reductions of 46% and 41%, respectively. For electricity generation, 10% cofiring at coal power plant with NTB and TOB showed GHG emission reductions of 6% and 8%, respectively. For the TOB supply chain, a large portion of the GW impact of the came from the torrefaction process and followed by the drying process. This was due to the propane use in these processes. Comparative analysis showed that near-woods biomass conversion for TOB production instead of processing feedstock at an in-town facility with access to grid electricity found 48%–55% lower GW impact for both electricity and heat generation scenarios, respectively. Resourced footprint analysis showed that most exergy extraction from the natural environment came from the drying process for NTB supply chain. In the TOB product system, torrefaction was the major contributor. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Bioenergy; Exergetic life cycle assessment; Life cycle assessment; Resource use assessment; Torrefaction; Wood briquettes","Bioconversion; Biomass; Briquets; Drying; Electric power generation; Emission control; Environmental technology; Exergy; Feedstocks; Forestry; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Power plants; Propane; Supply chains; Sustainable development; Bio-energy; Exergetic life cycle assessments; Life Cycle Assessment (LCA); Resource use; Torrefaction; Life cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85068042791

Most developing countries are particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change due to their economic circumstances. As such, they are often less able to implement adaptation strategies to reduce climate-related impact. Based on this, this study deals with the risk, vulnerability and adaptive measures in the case of sudden disasters (i.e. heavy floods and tsunami) by applying the disaster vulnerability approach, using a case study in Malaysia. This study applies three basic indicators of climatic disasters' impact and issues – (i) flood disaster vulnerability (Ω); (ii) flood disaster magnitude (Π); and (iii) integration of adaptive flood risk management (§) using public risk perception of climate disasters and flood prevention strategies. Following the findings, this study proposes procedural and theoretical frameworks which are comparatively new to the research of climate threats (climate change, variability and disasters).

The tool integrates and simulates impacts of land and water interventions on the water balance to determine their impact across climate-smart agricultural objectives of agricultural productivity, climate change adaptation and mitigation. The tool was implemented in two villages in the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. The tool performs well in simulating village water balance and its impact on the yield of rainfed and irrigated crop areas. Results show that considerable differences exist within the portfolio of land and water interventions, with only a combination of supply, demand and moisture conservation practices being able to help achieve climate-smart agricultural objectives.

To evaluate the direct effects of climate change on the transport and accumulation of nitrate-N, we developed an integrated modeling framework combining climatic change, nitrate-N infiltration in the unsaturated zone, and groundwater level fluctuations. The study was based on a center-pivot irrigated corn field at the Nebraska Management Systems Evaluation Area (MSEA) site. Future groundwater recharge (GR) and actual evapotranspiration (ETa) rates were predicted via an inverse vadose zone modeling approach by using climatic data generated by the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) climate model under the RCP 8.5 scenario, which was downscaled from the global CCSM4 model to a resolution of 24 km by 24 km. A groundwater flow model was first calibrated on the basis of historical groundwater table measurements and then applied to predict the future groundwater table in 2057–2060. Finally, the predicted future GR rate, ETa rate, and groundwater level, together with future precipitation data from the WRF climate model, were used in a three-dimensional (3D) model to predict nitrate-N concentrations in the subsurface (saturated and unsaturated parts) from 2057 to 2060. The future GR was predicted to decrease in the study area, as compared with the average GR data from the literature. Correspondingly, the groundwater level was predicted to decrease (30 to 60 cm) over the 5 years of simulation in the future. The nitrate-N mass in the simulation domain was predicted to increase but at a slower rate than in the past. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the accumulation of nitrate-N is sensitive to groundwater table elevation changes and irrigation rates. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Groundwater recharge; Nitrate-N accumulation; Vadose zone modeling","3D modeling; Climate models; Groundwater flow; Inverse problems; Nitrates; Recharging (underground waters); Sensitivity analysis; Solute transport; Water quality; Weather forecasting; Actual evapotranspiration; Ground water recharge; Groundwater level fluctuation; Integrated model framework; Nitrate-N; Three dimensional (3-D) modeling; Vadose zone modeling; Weather research and forecasting; Climate change; ground water; nitrate; arable land; climate change; groundwater; infiltration; maize; nitrate; prediction; recharge; vadose zone; Article; climate change; concentration (parameter); evapotranspiration; field corn; irrigation (agriculture); nitrate leaching; pollution transport; precipitation; prediction; priority journal; river basin; sensitivity analysis; simulation; water contamination; water flow; Nebraska; Platte Basin; United States; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066808991

It was found that impurity metals iron and copper originating from the gold ore (Fe 1.6% and Cu 0.05%), were advantageous self-initiating oxidants and 87% of gold could be dissolved in pure calcium chloride (2.8 M) solution. In addition, no bromide, which is a commonly added aggressive additive in modern cyanide-free processes, was required. The lowest chloride concentrations applied were comparable (0.6 M) or even milder (0.3 M) than those typical of seawater chloride concentrations, and could still result in gold recovery, 72% and 64%, respectively, with copper as oxidant. Conventionally gold extraction is assumed to require highly aggressive leaching media, high redox potentials, and high gold complex stability in the solution. The findings presented can provide a competitive environmental and economic edge and therefore new horizons for future cyanide-free gold chloride technologies, suggesting that in future, even seawater can act as the basis for cyanide free gold leaching. © 2019","Carbon in chloride leach; Cyanide-free leaching; Material efficiency; Seawater; Sustainability","Activated carbon; Calcium chloride; Copper; Cyanides; Environmental technology; Gas plants; Iodine compounds; Leaching; Ores; Oxidants; Recovery; Redox reactions; Seawater; Sustainable development; Chemical consumption; Chloride concentrations; Chloride leach; Chloride solutions; Leaching parameters; Material efficiency; Redox potentials; State of the art; Gold compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067586950

The opportunity cost for this significant share is environmental degradation without required measures to protect the environment. Using the Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squared approach from 1995 to 2014, this study aims to explore the nexus between tourism and environmental pollution for three lower middle-income Southeast Asian economies: Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam. This paper uses carbon emissions as a proxy for environmental pollution against tourist arrivals with a few control variables for analysis. The Zivot-Andrews unit root test is applied to deal with structural breaks in data and the Gregory-Hansen test for robustness. The results confirm a negative impact of tourism on the environment for Indonesia and the Philippines; however, tourism improves the environmental quality of Vietnam. This implies that the relationship varies for different countries in the same region, depending on the country-specific characteristics and corresponding policies to protect the environment. The impact of governmental policies also differs for high and lower middle-income countries as one size cannot fit all. This study provides a comprehensive milieu of the impact of tourism on the environment. The identified dominant factors can guide Southeast Asian and other developing countries’ governments at all levels in systematically formulating policies; by using these policies, carbon emissions from tourism can be reduced efficiently, resulting in sustainable development in the region. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon emissions; Energy use; Environmental pollution; Southeast Asian economies; Tourism; Tourist arrivals","Carbon; Developing countries; Economics; Environmental protection; Pollution control; Carbon emissions; Energy use; Environmental pollutions; Southeast Asian economies; Tourism; Tourist arrivals; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85067560808

However, the detailed multiphase fluid dynamics and processes of GCS are not fully understood because various CO2 trapping mechanisms in geological formations have large variations in both spatial and temporal scales. As a result, there remain many uncertainties in determining the sequestration capacity of the reservoir and the safety of sequestered CO2 due to leakage. Furthermore, the sequestration efficiency is highly dependent on the CO2 injection strategy, which includes injection rate, injection pressure, and type of injection well, and its orientation, etc. The goal of GCS is to maximize the sequestration capacity and minimize the plume migration by optimizing the GCS operation. In this paper, first the basic fluid dynamics and trapping mechanisms for CO2 sequestration are briefly discussed. They are followed by a brief summary of current GCS projects worldwide with special emphasis on those in the United States. Majority of the paper is devoted to the numerical modeling, simulation, and optimization of CO2 sequestration in saline aquifers at macro spatial scales of a few to hundreds of kilometers and macro temporal scales of a few to hundreds of years. Examples of numerical simulations of a few large industrial scale projects are presented. The optimization studies include the investigation of various injection and well placement strategies to determine the optimal approach for maximizing the storage and minimizing the plume migration. © 2019 by ASME.",,"Aquifers; Fluid dynamics; Hydrogeology; Injection (oil wells); Numerical models; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon sequestration; Geological formation; Geological sequestration; Injection pressures; Optimization studies; Spatial and temporal scale; Trapping mechanisms; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85065235301

Salinity, which is associated with low water quality is a critical issue for California avocado growers and, coupled with avocado root rot, threatens the long-term sustainability of the industry since avocados (Persea americana Mill.) are known to be extremely salt sensitive. Salt tolerance of the ‘Hass’ variety, the most commonly grown scion in California, is influenced by rootstock. We investigated ‘Hass’ scions grafted onto three different avocado rootstocks under control (irrigation using water with EC = 0.65 dS/m) and salinity (irrigation using water with EC = 1.5 dS/m) conditions. Results indicated that, compared to control conditions, the irrigation of avocado trees using water with EC = 1.5 dS/m increased canopy damage by 44%, reduced survival by half of the trees tested, and caused yield losses of more than 63%. Avocado leaves visibly damaged by the salinity treatment (named as partially burned or PB leaves) experienced photoinhibition, and reduction of photosynthetic rate and water-use efficiency, suggesting that the poor performance in carbon assimilation contributed to reductions in yield and increases in mortality. The salinity treatment did not cause water stress and the poor performance of treated trees was attributable to chloride accumulation previously reported. Leaf carbon isotopic composition was affected in trees under salinity treatment by increasing the values of δ13C however, this affect was nor correlated with water-use efficiency. Overall, ‘R0.05’, ‘PP40’ and ‘Dusa’ performed similarly and, considering the conditions of the experiment and the intrinsic susceptibility of avocado trees to salinity, were superior to all other rootstocks tested. Future screenings for salinity tolerant rootstocks are required to improve yield when poor quality soil or water is used. Overall, our results showed a coordination between the physiological performance, health and productivity of the ‘Hass’ scion and how these parameters were negatively affected by salinity. © 2019","Crop trees; Persea americana; Physiology; Plant stress; Rootstock; Salinity","agricultural production; crop plant; crop yield; fruit; physiological response; physiology; rootstock; salinity; water availability; water quality; water supply; water use efficiency; California; United States; Persea americana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069466281

Globally, valuation research has increased markedly over the past two decades, partly due to the influence of environmentalism and the notable depletion of ES. Using meta-analysis of 1156 peer-reviewed journal articles from 1994 to 2017, this study assesses forest ES valuation, focusing on temporal trends, methodological approaches, the types of services most frequently evaluated, and the origin of ES valuation research, especially biomes, economy, and management modalities. Findings suggest that western European countries, including the UK, had the highest number of publications (33%) followed by the United States (15%) and China (13%). Countries with lower middle and low income collectively share only about 14% of the total publications, indicating a large gap in ES research in these countries. In terms of valuation methods, monetary valuation was initially popular, while non-monetary valuation using modelling and mapping methods is gaining popularity. The study revealed that more than 80% of studies have consistently assessed multiple functions of forests but largely focus on regulating services (carbon storage/sequestration/climate regulation). Similarly, about 57% of total ES research was carried out on public land, government managed forests and protected areas, whereas less than 3% was on community-based forestry (CBF), which shares more than 15% and 31% of the forests in developed and developing countries, respectively. Whilst ES publications on forestry have seen significant increases, valuation studies in countries with high biodiversity are conspicuously unrepresented; particularly on forests in mountain regions in low to lower-middle income countries. Some reasons for this disparity in ES research under four themes are discussed, in connection with the global climate change, biodiversity policies, and national, bilateral and multilateral initiatives. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.","Community-based management; Ecosystem Services; Forests; Mountain; Valuation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85069678710

This study places its focus on analysing the ability of KSA’s new residential building envelope codes to successfully function according to the climate at present and in the future. In Jeddah, KSA, two single-family villas were examined with DesignBuilder simulation software and impacts of the new codes that were applied were assessed. Achieving the validation of the energy model requires the measurement of temperature indoors and outdoors. In addition, a long-term financial study was conducted to analyse the economic feasibility of the codes under the current and future climate change periods. Although the study shows the new codes produce a reduction in energy consumption by 14% to 40 % from the current cases, with the inclusion of wall and roof insulation being the most effective features of the new requirements of the codes.

Furthermore, the Water Evaluation and Planning tool (WEAP) model was used for the water resources utilization simulation and adaptation scenarios by the different riparian users. The SWAT model performed satisfactorily for streamflow and water yield prediction both in the calibration and validation phases with a R2 of 0.57-0.68 and RSR of 0.66-0.82, while the WEAP model calibration and validation at the same station with rainfall data posted a R2 of 0.64 and 0.89. Planners and decision-makers on water resources allocation, therefore, need to consider several integrated plans as alternatives to the adaptation to climate change impacts and anthropogenic activities in resolving the unmet demands. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Climate change; Dependable flow; Geographic Information Systems; SWAT; Water Management; WEAP","Catchments; Decision making; Geographic information systems; Information management; Information systems; Information use; Rain; Resource allocation; Runoff; Smart city; Water management; Adaptation to climate changes; Calibration and validations; Dependable flow; Model calibration and validation; Soil and water assessment tool; SWAT; Water resources utilizations; WEAP; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077738413

Modern distribution systems employ Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) to assist the local networks in terms of CO2 reduction, security of supply and power quality. The economic merits of DERs are numerous and they can include any generator type or energy-storage device connected to the distribution network. The generators in common use are wind turbines and photovoltaic systems. Several scientific contributions tackled recently the issue of connecting distribution energy resources to the primary systems along the main where they are most valuable. In this paper, a new generalized approach is developed to investigate the substation area expansion as affected by the interconnection of a wind turbine generating system at the opposite end of the primary main. Equations are derived based on the permissible voltage drop defined between the substation feed point and the last distribution transformer. Simulation results show that additional area coverage could be achieved by interconnection a wind turbine and a set of curves are drawn to be readily used for linear-dimension areas with uniform load densities. © 2019 IEEE.","distributed generation; Distribution systems; voltage drop; wind turbines generating systems","Costs; Electric energy storage; Electric transformers; Energy resources; Expansion; Industrial electronics; Photovoltaic cells; Distributed Energy Resources; Distribution engineers; Distribution systems; Distribution transformer; Photovoltaic systems; Primary distribution; Scientific contributions; Wind Turbine Generating systems; Wind turbines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084084397

The role of water use in driving these emissions, and the apportioning of the emissions to individual countries engaged in paddy cultivation, are aspects that have been mired in controversy and disagreement. This is largely due to the fact that methane (CH4) emissions not only change with the cultivar type but also regions, climate, soil type, soil conditions, manner of irrigation, type and quantity of fertilizer added-to name a few. The factors which can influence these aspects also encompass a wide range, and have origins in causes which can be physical, chemical, biological, and combinations of these. Exceedingly complex feedback mechanisms, exerting different magnitudes and types of influences on CH4 emissions under different conditions, are operative. Similar is the case of nitrous oxide (N2O); indeed, the present level of understanding of the factors which influence the quantum of its emission is still more patchy. This makes it difficult to even understand precisely the role of the myriad factors, less so model them. The challenge is made even more daunting by the fact that accurate and precise data on most of these aspects is lacking. This makes it nearly impossible to develop analytical models linking causes with effects vis a vis CH4 and N2O emissions from paddy fields. For situations like this the bioinspired artificial intelligence technique of artificial neural network (ANN), which can model a phenomenon on the basis of past data and without the explicit understanding of the mechanism phenomena, may prove useful. However, no such model for CH4 or N2O has been developed so far. Hence the present work was undertaken. It describes ANN-based models developed by us to predict CH4 and N2O emissions using soil characteristics, fertilizer inputs, and rice cultivar yield as inputs. Upon testing the predictive ability of the models with sets of data not used in model development, it was seen that there was excellent agreement between model forecasts and experimental findings, leading to correlations coefficients of 0.991 and 0.96, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 11.17 and 261.3, respectively, for CH4 and N2O emissions. Thus, the models can be used to estimate CH4 and N2O emissions from all those continuously flooded paddy wetlands for which data on total organic carbon, soil electrical conductivity, applied nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium, NPK, and grain yield is available. © 2019 by the authors.","Artificial neural networks; Greenhouse gas emissions; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Oryza sativa; Paddy; Rice","Ability testing; Climate change; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Mean square error; Methane; Neural networks; Nitrogen oxides; Organic carbon; Soils; Wetlands; Artificial intelligence techniques; Nitrous oxide; Nitrous oxide emissions; Oryza sativa; Paddy; Rice; Root mean square errors; Soil electrical conductivity; Gas emissions; agricultural emission; agricultural land; anthropogenic source; artificial intelligence; artificial neural network; greenhouse gas; methane; nitrous oxide; rice; source apportionment; water use; Oryza sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85074361567

For the efficient and reliable operation of GIS, it is necessary to investigate non-uniform field breakdown in SF6. Generation of free electrons is an essential prerequisite for initiation and propagation of positive discharges. A 3D particle-in-cell MonteCarlo collision (PIC-MCC) model is used to investigate the initiation of positive needle-to-plane streamer discharge in SF6 with field ionization at pressures ranging from 1 to 5 bar. Free electrons are generated from impurity molecules with low density and low ionization energy in SF6 because of field ionization. The local electric field dependent electron generation rate is calculated using Zener's model. Two stages of tree like streamer discharge are observed. In first phase, a spherical shape inception cloud is formed around the needle tip, which eventually destabilizes into multiple branches in the next stage. With the increase in pressure, the decrease in particle density, number of branches and total propagation length of streamer discharge is observed. The simulation results show that field ionization could be the possible source of ionization in SF6 in the presence of high electric field. © 2019 IEEE.",,"Electric discharges; Electric switchgear; Insulation; Ionization of gases; Needles; Sulfur hexafluoride; Electron generation; Gas insulated switchgear(GIS); High electric fields; Increase in pressure; Initiation and propagation; Local electric field; Monte-carlo collisions; Particle-in-cell simulations; SF6 insulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081668384
