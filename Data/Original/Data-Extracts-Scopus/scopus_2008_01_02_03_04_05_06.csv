The ability of African rue seedlings to tolerate and recover from progressive drought was examined in greenhouse experiments. Water was withheld for 15 d, and a subset of plants were rewatered after 12 d of water deficit to examine recovery. Conductance rate decreased to 0.1 mol H2O m-2 s-1 and photosynthesis rate decreased to 2 μmol CO2 m-2 s-1 within 6 and 12 d, respectively. Leaf water potential decreased more slowly than gas exchange rates; after 15 d of water deficit plants maintained net carbon gain at -4.8 MPa. Photosynthesis and conductance rates of rewatered plants recovered to levels similar to well-watered controls within 9 and 12 d, respectively. After 9 d of water deficit, seedlings needed only 4 d to recover physiological function similar to well-watered controls. Reduced seedling biomass was observed after 6 d of water deficit, and biomass remained smaller than controls after 15 d of recovery. The rapid change in conductance rate and slower response in leaf water potential indicates that stomatal control is an important component of seedling response to water deficit. The success of African rue in arid environments is due in part to the ability of seedlings to tolerate and recover from water deficit.","Invasive species; Progressive drought; Rangeland weed; Weed management","angiosperm; arid environment; gas exchange; invasive species; perennial plant; physiology; rangeland; seedling; water stress; weed control; North America; United States; Peganum harmala",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349100178

We performed a full chemical analysis using the new generation of hydrostatic, spherically symmetric carbon-rich model atmospheres and the spectral synthesis method in LTE.Results.The luminosities, atmosphere parameters and chemical composition of ALW-C6 and ALW-C7 are compatible with these stars being in the TP-AGB phase undergoing third dredge-up episodes, although their extrinsic nature (external pollution in a binary stellar system) cannot be definitively excluded. Our chemical analysis shows that the metallicity of both stars agree with the average metallicity ([Fe/H] ~ dex) previously derived for this satellite galaxy from the analysis of both low resolution spectra of RGB stars and the observed colour magnitude diagrams. ALW-C6 and ALW-C7 present strong -element enhancements, [ /Fe] , , respectively. These enhancements and the derived -process indexes [ /Fe] , [ /Fe] and [ ] are compatible with theoretical -process nucleosynthesis predictions in low mass AGB stars (~) on the basis that the C()O is the main source of neutrons. Furthermore, the analysis of C and CN bands reveals a large carbon enhancement (C/O ~ and 5, respectively), much larger than the values typically found in galactic AGB carbon stars (C/O ~ ). This is also in agreement with the theoretical prediction that AGB carbon stars are formed more easily through third dredge-up episodes as the initial stellar metallicity drops. However, theoretical low-mass AGB models apparently fail to simultaneously fit the observed -element and carbon enhancements. On the other hand, Zr is found to be less enhanced in ALW-C7 compared to the other elements belonging to the same -peak. Although the abundance errors are large, the fact that in this star the abundance of Ti (which has a similar condensation temperature to Zr) seems also to be lower than those of others metals, may indicate the existence of some depletion into dust-grains in its photosphere. © 2008 ESO.","Galaxies: dwarf; Galaxies: Local Group; Stars: abundances; Stars: AGB and post-AGB; Stars: carbon","Astrophysics; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon; Emission spectroscopy; Galaxies; Luminance; Galaxies: dwarf; Galaxies: Local Group; Photosphere; Stars: abundances; Stars: AGB and post-AGB; Stars: carbon; Stellar metallicity; Stars",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41449114396

However, recent reports provide conflicting support for the pattern, questioning whether Bergmann's clines are generally present in amphibians. In this study, we measured 96,996 adult Plethodon from 3974 populations to test for the presence of Bergmann's clines in these salamanders. Only three Plethodon species exhibited a significant negative correlation between body size and temperature consistent with Bergmann's rule, whereas 37 of 40 species did not display a pattern consistent with this prediction. Further, a phylogenetic comparative analysis found no relationship between body size and temperature among species. A meta-analysis combining our data with the available data for other amphibian species revealed no support for Bergmann's rule at the genus (Plethodon), order (Caudata), or class (Amphibia) levels. Our findings strongly suggest that negative thermal body size clines are not common in amphibians, and we conclude that Bergmann's rule is not generally applicable to these taxa. Thus, evolutionary explanations of Bergmann's clines in other tetrapods need not account for unique life-history attributes of amphibians. © 2007 The Author(s).","Bergmann's rule; Body size; Kernel density estimation; Meta-analysis; Plethodon; Thermal clines","amphibian; body size; climate; cline; comparative study; ectothermy; life history; measurement method; meta-analysis; phylogeny; temperature effect; testing method; adaptation; Amphibia; animal; article; biological model; body size; body temperature; classification; climate; evolution; genetics; geography; histology; molecular evolution; species difference; temperature; United States; Adaptation, Biological; Amphibia; Animals; Body Size; Body Temperature; Classification; Climate; Evolution; Evolution, Molecular; Geography; Models, Genetic; Species Specificity; Temperature; United States; Urodela; Amphibia; Caudata; Plethodon; Salamandroidea; Tetrapoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39749113143

The federal government continues to involve itself in highly localized issues with little clear connection to interstate environmental issues or a manifest need for federal uniformity. At the same time, states and local governments, especially recently, are not content to confine their attention to issues of local concern but are developing policies on environmental issues of national and even international importance. Nor do environmental issues “stay” in the control of any particular level of government but rather tend to pass back and forth, much like the proverbial football, between different levels of government. The current system of environmental federalism is therefore a dynamic one of overlapping federal and state jurisdiction. However, it is threatened by federal legislation and Supreme Court rulings. A wave of preemptive legislation has emerged from Congress in recent years. Numerous bills pending in Congress, for example, would preempt state actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs) that contribute to climate change. Similarly, following a long line of cases in which the Supreme Court has preempted a variety of state actions designed to protect the public, the Court recently (2004) preempted state auto-pollution regulations, despite, at best, ambiguous statutory language. Legal academics are similarly hostile to the dynamism of environmental federalism because it runs contrary to the prevailing view that an optimal level of government exists from which to set environmental policy. © Cambridge University Press 2009.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927044000

The Pani-MeSA polymer was characterized by FT-IR, UV-vis, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and impedance spectroscopy. The polymer was dispersed in polyvinylacetate and coated on carbon steel samples by a dipping method. The electrochemical behavior and anticorrosion properties of the coating on carbon steel in 3% NaCl were investigated using open-circuit potential (OCP) versus time of exposure, and electrochemical techniques including electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potentiodynamic polarization and cyclic voltammetry (CV). During initial exposure, the OCP dropped about 0.35 V and the interfacial resistance increased several times, indicating a certain reduction of the polymer and oxidation of the steel surface. Later the OCP shifted to the noble direction and remained at a stable value during the exposure up to 60 days. The EIS monitoring also revealed the initial change and later stabilization of the coating. The stable high OCP and low coating impedance suggest that the conducting polymer maintains its oxidative state and provides corrosion protection for carbon steel throughout the investigated period. The polarization curves and CV show that the conducting polymer coating induces a passive-like behavior and greatly reduces the corrosion of carbon steel. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Liquefied natural gas (LNG) has traditionally been transported via steam turbine (ST) ships. Recently, LNG shippers have begun using dual-fuel diesel engines (DFDEs) to propel and offload their cargoes. Both the conventional ST boilers and DFDE are capable of burning a range of fuels, from heavy fuel oil to boil-off-gas (BOG) from the LNG load. In this paper a method for estimating the emissions from ST boilers and DFDEs during LNG offloading operations at berth is presented, along with typical emissions from LNG ships during offloading operations under different scenarios ranging from worst-case fuel oil combustion to the use of shore power. The impact on air quality in nonattainment areas where LNG ships call is discussed. Current and future air pollution control regulations for ocean-going vessels (OGVs) such as LNG ships are also discussed. The objective of this study was to estimate and compare emissions of criteria pollutants from conventional ST and DFDE ships using different fuels. The results of this study suggest that newer DFDE ships have lower SO2 and PM2.5/PM10 emissions, conventional ST ships have lower NOx, volatile organic compound, and CO emissions; and DFDE ships utilizing shore power at berth produce no localized emissions because they draw their required power from the local electric grid.

In highly motorized countries such as the US, policy-makers are beginning to recognize that shifting some travel from auto trips to walking trips can help the country achieve important policy objectives such as combating obesity and reducing the air pollution and oil dependency that result from auto use. However, researchers know very little about pedestrian behaviour and the role of the built and aesthetic environment in influencing pedestrian trips to transit. As communities wrestle with the interconnected issues of obesity, sprawl, and quality of life, planners need to understand how far Americans will walk to transit and the environmental factors that influence them. This survey of 328 pedestrians walking to rail stations, primarily on weekday mornings, found that they were willing to walk an average of half a mile to the rail station and that minimizing the distance walked was the most important factor influencing their choice of route. The people surveyed also frequently mentioned safety factors as important in route choice. Aesthetic elements of the built environment, on the other hand, were rarely mentioned as important route choice factors. The paper concludes by using these survey findings to recommend strategies that planners, designers, and policy-makers can use to design successful transit and pedestrian-oriented developments.",,"atmospheric pollution; obesity; pedestrian; policy strategy; preference behavior; railway transport; spatial analysis; transportation mode; transportation policy; walking; California; North America; Oregon; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39049150430

Although over the last 20 years the city has registered a slower population growth, its urban area continues to expand. The particular problem with the expansion to the south is that urbanization is invading a so-called Preservation Zone (Suelo de Conservacion) that represents a territory subject to preservation given its ecological value in terms of climate regulation, water recharge, forest communities, agricultural cultivation, and hilly landscape. In this particular space, there is a process of diffused urbanization with very low densities in the Preservation Zone. In recent years it has been possible to identify a high number of illegal settlements of low income populations within its limits. This is a continuous, small-scale process, but in the medium and long term it means a significant loss of land with high ecological value. This process happens despite land use planning regulations being in existence since the late 1970s. From 1970 to 1995 just over 10 thousand hectares were lost including irrigation land and forest areas. The analysis includes, the dynamics and main patterns of urbanization in the Preservation Zone, the description of planning norms, and a precise measurement of illegal settlements. The paper concludes that this peri-urban process shows, a marked environmental damage, lack of effectiveness of planning norms and of increasing living standards of the poor, all of which show an ineffective urban governance, that does not contribute to sustainability in the Preservation Zone and in the city in general. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A polyphasic approach was used to assess the functional diversity of microbial populations likely to catalyze electron flow under conditions proposed for in situ uranium bioremediation. The addition of ethanol and glucose as supplemental electron donors stimulated microbial nitrate and Fe(III) reduction as the predominant terminal electron-accepting processes (TEAPs). U(VI), Fe(III), and sulfate reduction overlapped in the glucose treatment, whereas U(VI) reduction was concurrent with sulfate reduction but preceded Fe(III) reduction in the ethanol treatments. Phyllosilicate clays were shown to be the major source of Fe(III) for microbial respiration by using variable-temperature Mössbauer spectroscopy. Nitrate- and Fe(III)-reducing bacteria (FeRB) were abundant throughout the shifts in TEAPs observed in biostimulated microcosms and were affiliated with the genera Geobacter, Tolumonas, Clostridium, Arthrobacter, Dechloromonas, and Pseudomonas. Up to two orders of magnitude higher counts of FeRB and enhanced U(VI) removal were observed in ethanol-amended treatments compared to the results in glucose-amended treatments. Quantification of citrate synthase (gltA) levels demonstrated a stimulation of Geobacteraceae activity during metal reduction in carbon-amended microcosms, with the highest expression observed in the glucose treatment. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the active FeRB share high sequence identity with Geobacteraceae members cultivated from contaminated subsurface environments. Our results show that the functional diversity of populations capable of U(VI) reduction is dependent upon the choice of electron donor. Copyright © 2008, American Society for Microbiology.

Both parameters were studied in a systematic approach under specific local meteorological conditions at nine different composting plants in Germany with emphasis on dispersal of microorganisms. Measurements were done at emission points and at sampling sites in the downwind and upwind directions of the facilities under 'normal case' (i.e. weather conditions typical for the location in combination with working activities at the plants) and 'real worst case' conditions (dispersal of bioaerosols into the surroundings expected to occur with high probability). Airborne microorganisms were sampled using filtration and impingement. Subsequent cultivation on four different culture media allowed quantification and identification of the culturable microflora. It turned out that a general assessment of emissions and dispersal of bioaerosols from composting plants is not possible because of the coherences of various factors influencing the dispersal. The site-specific meteorological situations must be considered carefully, whenever sampling locations are selected and need to be recorded in any sampling protocol. Air inversions in particular can lead to high concentrations of microorganisms (>104-105 cfu m-3 of thermophilic actinomycetes and thermotolerant fungi) in the surroundings of composting plants. Finally, it was shown that both thermotolerant fungi and thermophilic actinomycetes can serve as indicator organisms. © 2007 Elsevier GmbH.

An analysis of X-ray images of the Z-pinch shows that the dimensions and spatial structures of the emitting regions are different for hard and soft X rays. It is found that the HXR emission peak is delayed with respect to the soft X-ray (SXR) one. The dependence of the HXR power on the material, initial diameter, and mass (implosion time) of the wire array is determined. It is shown that the HXR intensity in the spectral range >50 keV is several orders higher than the emission intensity in the high-energy tail of the SXR spectrum (assuming that this spectrum is thermal). A comparison of the time evolution and spatial localization of the HXR and SXR sources during the implosion of wire arrays indicates the presence of a new superthermal phenomenon that differs qualitatively from the processes determining the peak power of the SXR pulse. Possible mechanisms that can be responsible for the generation of HXR pulses are considered. © 2008 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43049086289

Furthermore, quantifying the global carbon budget and characterising uncertainties have emerged as critical to a successful implementation of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its Kyoto Protocol. Beyond fundamental quantification, attribution of the processes responsible for the so-called 'residual terrestrial uptake' is important to the carbon cycle communities' ability to simulate the future response of the terrestrial biosphere to climate change and intentional sequestration activities. The objective of this chapter is to describe the approaches to model-data fusion enabling continued advances in quantifying carbon cycling and the terrestrial mechanisms at work. The major impediments to advances in this field include accounting for climate variability and uncertainties in model outcomes. One proposed solution to overcome these obstacles is the use of data from the FLUXNET network to characterise the relative strength of climate impact on plant productivity and respiration. Other solutions involve the use of atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements for model validation and the use of remote sensing data. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The geographical coverage of MFRSR networks is complementary to that of AERONET and often provides better spatial density of measurement sites, especially in the United States. We describe our recently updated analysis algorithm for MFRSR data that allows partitioning of the spectral aerosol optical depth (AOD) into fine and coarse mode AOD and retrieval of the fine mode effective radius. Our recent sensitivity study demonstrated that for a typical measurement accuracy 0.01 of AOD, the trade-offs between the spectral aerosol extinction and NO2 absorption in the visible range effectively prevent unambiguous retrieval of NO2 column from MFRSR data and may also bias aerosol size distribution retrievals. This has prompted us to adopt a new retrieval approach, which utilizes climatological NO2 (based on SCIAMACHY satellite retrievals) and uses column ozone from TOMS measurements. The performance of this new approach was evaluated using the long-term data set from the Southern Great Plains (SGP) site operated by the U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Program. We present a detailed intercomparison of total, fine, and coarse mode AOD and fine mode effective radius between two MFRSRs located at the SGP's Central Facility and with the correlative AERONET Sun-sky inversion results (Version 2) derived from a collocated CIMEL Sun photometer. The comparison between two MFRSRs demonstrated good consistency of both the measurements and the analysis. Agreement with AERONET inversions is remarkably good, in that differences in AOD components do not exceed the expected measurement accuracy of 0.01, while the retrieved values of fine mode effective radius show no relative bias and only 0.03 μm random error (standard deviation of the differences). We show that if only data with large enough AOD (more than 0.06 at 870 nm) are selected, this error is reduced by a factor of two, becoming about 10% of a typical fine mode effective radius value.

Based on the factor scores, six conditional functions were defined to allocate each pixel to a region. In order to simplify the models, one index variable was substituted for each factor. Then, through Discriminant Analysis, the constants and coefficients of the models were determined. The final models were evaluated against some examples, one of which, Yazd, was demonstrated fully. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,"ARC-INFO; climate modeling; cluster analysis; discriminant analysis; factor analysis; GIS; pixel; synoptic meteorology; Asia; Eurasia; Iran; Middle East; Yazd",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41049092313

Assessment of data from New York, NY; Baltimore, MD; Pittsburgh, PA; Atlanta, GA; Houston, TX; St. Louis, MO; and Fresno, CA, indicates that in virtually all of the regions, transport of aerosol over distances of 100-1000 km has a significant impact on urban particulate matter concentrations and a dominant role in determining rural particulate matter concentrations, though the nature of the regional contributions differs from region to region. This assessment is generally consistent with previous conceptual models of fine particulate matter formation and accumulation in these regions. The nature of the transported aerosol is largely sulfate in Eastern and Midwestern cities and nitrate in the Central Valley of California. In addition to physical transport of aerosol over distances of 100-1000 km, regional transport of aerosol precursors may lead to conditions conducive to large-scale nucleation events. Regional nucleation events have been reported in the East, Midwest, and in California. The events occurred in the morning soon after surface layers coupled with layers aloft, and the events generate ultrafine particles. In some cases, these nucleation events have been correlated with availability of sulfur dioxide and, therefore, may be sulfate formation events.

However, although current understanding of possible long-term response of vegetation to elevated CO2 and CO2-induced climate change in some geographical areas (e.g., the high-latitude regions) has been strengthened by dint of accumulating evidence from these past studies, it is still weak in others. This study examines the responses of global potential natural vegetation distribution, net primary production (NPP), and fire emissions to future changes in atmospheric CO2 concentration and climate using the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Land Model's dynamic global vegetation model. The model is run to vegetative equilibrium (i.e., with respect to leaf area index (LAI) and vegetation coverage) driven with preindustrial climate and future climate near 2100, respectively, simulated by eight general circulation models (GCMs). The simulated potential vegetation under the preindustrial control mean climate (CO2 concentration held at 275 ppm) is compared with that under the SRESA1B 2100 mean climate (CO2 concentration stabilizes at 720 ppm beyond 2100). Simulated vegetation response ranges from mild changes of the fractional coverage of different plant functional types to the rather dramatic changes of dominant plant functional types. Although such response differs significantly across different GCM climate projections, a quite consistent spatial pattern emerges, characterized by a considerable poleward spread or shift of temperate and boreal forests in the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, and a substantial degradation of vegetation type in the tropics (e.g., increase of drought deciduous trees coverage at the expense of evergreen trees) especially in portions of West and southern Africa and South America. Despite the widespread degradation of vegetation type in the tropics, NPP, and growing season LAI are predicted to increase under most GCM scenarios over most of the globe. Carbon fluxes to the atmosphere due to fire generally increase too across the globe. Such responses of NPP and fire occurrence result from the synergistic effects of CO2 concentration changes, climate changes, and vegetation changes. In the HadCM-driven simulation, however, extreme responses are shown in some regions: Deciduous forest is replaced by grasses in large areas in the middle latitudes, and substantial areas in northern South America and southern Africa predominantly covered by evergreen forest are replaced with grasses while NPP and fire emissions reduce drastically (by more than 100%). A future paper will examine how the biosphere response documented here influences the impact of climate change on surface hydrological conditions.

In this paper, we evaluate the distributed model, Kineros2, in application to an arid catchment in Oman, using rainfall-runoff data from 27 storm events. The analysis looks at model sensitivities, uncertainty and performance, based on uniform random sampling of the model parameter space and predictions of features of the observed hydrograph at the catchment outlet. A series of three experiments used different calibration strategies (an 11-parameter calibration, a 5-parameter calibration, and a 3-parameter calibration allowing some spatial variability of the saturated hydraulic conductivity). The parameters most significantly affecting flow peak and volume performance are those controlling infiltration rates on hillslopes. The model output was also generally sensitive to a parameter within the rainfall interpolation model. Relatively little sensitivity to initial catchment wetness was observed. Prediction performance was generally poor, for all events and for all the tested calibration and prediction strategies; and the uncertainty, estimated using model ensembles, was very high. A 2-parameter regression model used in previous work was found to perform better for predicting flow peaks. Literature review shows our results are consistent with experience of other modellers of arid and semi-arid climate hydrology. In order to realise the potential value of distributed, physically based models, for application to arid and semi-arid regions, significant data collection and further research is required, in particular regarding spatial rainfall observation and modelling. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In CB-PP/PS blends, CB was found to preferentially localize in the PS phase. However, upon the introduction of styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) tri-block copolymer, CB showed higher affinity to the polybutadiene (PBD) section of the SBS copolymer, which was selectively localized at the interface between PP and PS, within the PP phase and within the PS main particle coating PS subparticles and connecting them together. There is a 40% reduction in the percolation threshold in the (70/30) PP/PS blend upon addition of 5 vol% SBS because of the selective localization of CB in the PBD phase and the change of blend morphology. SBS was found to change the morphology of the dispersed PS phase into a rod-like structure at a critical SBS loading. Moreover, for composites with or without SBS, at a certain CB loading above the percolation threshold, the mixture exhibited a co-continuous morphology in contrast to the dispersed morphology of the (70/30) PP/PS blend without CB or at low CB loadings. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The compounds tested were potassium acetate, sodium pyruvate, fumaric acid, succinic acid, sodium citrate and glycerol. For comparison, the bacterial numbers on glucose (a conventional carbon source) and Tween 80 and crude oil (unconventional carbon sources), as sole sources of carbon and energy were also determined. Sodium pyruvate was, in most cases, the carbon and energy source most commonly utilized by the cultivable surface water bacteria.

Quantification of heterotrophic bacteria associated with cultures of local picocyanobacterial strains, originally isolated from the Gulf surface water, also revealed that the carbon source most commonly utilized by cultivable bacteria was sodium pyruvate. However, a different bacterial composition was identified, with Alcanivorax, Stappia and Marinobacter as the major heterotrophic genera.

Oxidation catalytic converters of modern vehicles facilitating the formation of NO2 in the exhaust line, especially in diesel cars equipped with original equipment manufacturer (OEM) particle filters, are assumed to be responsible. NO2 is toxic and increased proportions of NO2 in total NOx in the atmosphere cause higher ambient ozone concentrations. These observations lead to a need for reliable emission factors for NO and NO2 for road vehicles, while only NOx is recorded in standard emission measurements. In this regard, it was recently shown that NO2 needs to be detected by an adequate online measuring method. The present work provides novel insight into these topics gained from an experimental campaign carried out with modern gasoline and diesel vehicles of certification categories Euro 3 and Euro 4. Reliable emission factors for NO and NO2 are presented for different driving situations, such as real-world driving, cold start and statutory tests, together with corresponding particle emission data. Highest emissions of NOx are recorded for diesel cars equipped with OEM particle filters with mass ratios of NO2 within NOx of up to 70%. The NOx emissions exceed the statutory emission limit and real-world emissions are even more pronounced, especially in urban driving conditions. Their particle emissions are greatly reduced, but the contribution of NO2 to soot oxidation is thought to be minor. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A study was made at laboratory scale using four 2 L reactors working semi-continuously at 35 °C. The effect of the organic loading rate (OLR) was initially examined (using equal proportion of the three components on a volatile solids, VS, basis). Anaerobic co-digestion with OLRs in the range 0.3-1.3 kg VS m-3 d-1 resulted in methane yields of 0.3 m3 kg-1 VS added, with a methane content in the biogas of 54-56%. However, at a further increased loading, the biogas production decreased and there was a reduction in the methane yield indicating organic overload or insufficient buffering capacity in the digester. In the second part of the investigation, co-digestion was studied in a mixture experiment using 10 different feed compositions.

Coulter Department of Biomedical Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, GA, United States","Positional enrichment analysis has become an important technique for assessing detailed flux distributions and the fates of specific atoms in metabolic pathway systems. The typical approach to positional enrichment analysis is performed by supplying specifically labeled substrate to a cell system, letting the system reach steady state, and measuring where label had arrived and accumulated. The data are then evaluated mathematically with the help of a linear stoichiometric flux distribution model. While this procedure has proven to yield new and valuable insights, it does not address the transient dynamics between providing label and its ultimate steady-state distribution, which is often of great interest to the experimentalist (pulse labeling experiments). We show here that an extension of a recent mathematical method for dynamic labeling analysis is able to shed light on these transitions, thereby revealing insights not obtained with traditional positional enrichment analyses. The method traces the dynamics of one or more carbons through fully regulated metabolic pathways, which, in principle, may be arbitrarily complex. After a brief review of the earlier method and description of the theoretical extension, we illustrate the method with an analysis of the pentose phosphate pathway in Zymomonas mobilis, which has been used for traditional positional enrichment analyses in the past. We show how different labeling schemes result in distinctly different transients, which nevertheless eventually lead to a steady-state labeling profile that coincides exactly with the corresponding profile from traditional analysis. Thus, over the domain of commonality, the proposed method leads to results equivalent to those from state-of-the-art existing methods. However, these steady-state results constitute only a small portion of the insights obtainable with the proposed method. Our method can also be used as an ""inverse"" technique for elucidating the topology and regulation of pathway systems, if appropriate time series data are available. While such dynamic data are still rather rare, they are now being generated with increasing frequency and we believe it is desirable, and indeed necessary, to accompany this trend with an adequate, rigorous method of analysis. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We hypothesized that in semiarid agroecosystems of the Mediterranean region, a shift from the traditional management system (including conventional tillage [CT] and a cereal-fallow rotation) to a more conservative system, including no-till (NT) and continuous cropping, could reduce CO2 emissions during the cropping season. Thus, in this study, we studied the effects of tillage and cropping systems on C inputs and soil CO2 fluxes during three cropping seasons at three different sites in the Ebro River valley (northeast Spain). Carbon inputs ranged from 650 to 6000 kg ha-1 and seasonal average CO2 flux ranged from 0.10 to 1.76 g CO2 m-2 h-1. Differences in rainfall led to marked differences in C inputs and soil fluxes among growing seasons. Although differences among tillage treatments were weak, CO2 fluxes under NT were always lower. Intensification of cropping systems led to an increase in C input. A move from CT to NT together with cropping intensification is suitable to increase C inputs and to reduce soil CO2 fluxes in semiarid Mediterranean agroecosystems. © Soil Science Society of America.

The results of the analyses of the aliphatic fraction indicate that all samples contain n-alkanes ranging from C14 to C32, with C25, C26, C27 and C29 being the more abundant congeners. Fossil fuels biomarkers such as extended tricyclic terpanes (hopanes, steranes) and isoprenoid hydrocarbons (pristane, phytane) were observed in our samples on a daily basis. Source reconciliation was conducted using molecular diagnostic ratios (such as the carbon preference index - CPI). The mean CPI value (1.84) indicates the mixed origin of the Athenian fine particles. The notable presence of an unresolved complex mixture or ""hump"" of hydrocarbons in our gas chromatograms is indicative of petrogenic hydrocarbon inputs. An approximate measure of this kind of contamination is the ratio of the concentrations of unresolved components to the resolved n-alkanes and other major compounds (U:R). The high U:R value of 25.25 further confirmed the major contribution of fossil fuels. Yet, the percent contribution of leaf wax n-alkanes (25.15%) indicated the parallel contribution of biogenic sources. This work supports the conclusion that vehicular emissions were the major source of aliphatic organic compounds with a smaller contribution of biogenic n-alkanes during the study period in Athens. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Aliphatic hydrocarbons; Athens; Atmospheric particulate matter; N-alkanes; Organic aerosol; PM2.5; Urban aerosol","aliphatic hydrocarbon; atmospheric pollution; biogenic emission; hydrocarbon; particulate matter; traffic emission; urban area; Athens [Attica]; Attica; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349192798

This is based on the premise that habitat variability in the past was at least as great as at present; that this variability at the landscape level is a function of variations in geology, soils, and topography rather than climate; and that vegetation type at the landscape level can be reconstructed from these environmental variables. Measurable variation in climate in tropical Africa today occurs over distances of at least 100 km, so that ranges of habitat variation within the limited area of Laetoli today can be reconstructed in relation to soils and topography, and the effects of climate changes are then estimated in relation to these other factors. In order to document the modern vegetation, we have made voucher collections of plants in the Laetoli region, recorded distributions of plants by habitat, climate, soil, and topography, and mapped the vegetation distributions. Results show that areas of low relief have soils with impeded drainage and dense Acacia drepanolobium woodland, having low canopies when disturbed by human action, higher when not; shallow brown soils on volcanic lavas have four woodland associations, two dominated by Acacia species, two by Combretum-Albizia species; shallow volcanic soils to the east have a woodland association with Croton-Dombeya-Albizia species; elevated land to the east on volcanic soils has two associations of montane-edge species, one with Croton-Celtis-Lepidotrichilia, and the other with Acacia lahai; the eastern highlands above 2,750 m have montane forest; seasonal water channels flowing from east to west have three Acacia riverine woodland associations; three deep valleys to the north of the area have dense riverine woodland with Celtis, Albizia, Euclea, Combretum, Acacia spp.; emergence of springs at Endulen feed a perennial stream with closed gallery forest with Ficus-Croton-Lepidotrichilia; and, finally, recent ash falls have produced immature alkaline soils with calcrete formation and short grass vegetation. All of these vegetation associations have been modified by human disturbance to greater or lesser degrees, and we have attempted to allow for this both by basing the associations on the least modified areas and by predicting how the associations, or parts of associations, have been altered by human action. Past land forms at Laetoli have been based on the geology and geomorphology of the area. Past vegetation patterns were estimated by superimposing present distributions of plant associations on equivalent landforms in the past, assuming similar climate to the present. This indicates the overall pattern of vegetation at Laetoli to have been a mosaic of low and tall deciduous woodlands and with riverine woodland and forest associations along water courses. Low woodlands would have been dominated by Acacia species, and tall woodlands by Combretum-Albizia species, with increasing increments of montane species, such as Croton species, to the east of the area. Riverine woodlands would have been dominated by Acacia-Euclea species, with wetter associations (downriver or linked with spring activity) supporting gallery forest with Ficus, Celtis, and Croton species. These are all species associations common in the area today, and with landforms little changed in the past, and assuming similar climate, there is every reason to predict that they would have been present in the past. Moreover, Pliocene environments lack the human disturbance that has destroyed much of the present day vegetation. Presence of woodlands is supported by fossil wood attributed to several of the tree species present in the area today and by similarities in the mammalian community structure between past and present. Having established the pattern for Pliocene vegetation based on climatic variables existing today, we then predict the effects of past variations in climate.

These techniques are, therefore, a very useful analysis tool, especially when the analyzed time series are characterized by numerous missing or erroneous data. The joint application of both Kalman filter and Kriging algorithms allows users to benefit from the main advantages of two independent methods, in order both to improve the performance of the developed model and to reduce its uncertainty.

This paper, as part of program OPEN, focuses on quantifying emissions of NH3 from water-holding structures at two of the best ESTs and compares them with the projected emissions from two conventional lagoon and spray technologies (LSTs). The evaluated ESTs are: (1) Super Soils at Goshen Ridge; and (2) Environmental Technologies at Red Hill. The water-holding structures for these two ESTs contained no conventional anaerobic lagoon. A dynamic flow-through chamber was used to measure NH3 fluxes from the water-holding structures at both the ESTs and at the conventional LST farms. In order to compare the emissions from the water-holding structures at the ESTs with those from the lagoons at the conventional sites under similar conditions, a statistical-observational model for lagoon NH3 emissions was used. A mass-balance approach was used to quantify the emissions. All emissions were normalized by nitrogen-excretion rates. The percentage reductions relative to the conventional lagoons were calculated for the two ESTs. Results showed substantial reductions in NH3 emissions at both ESTs. Super Soils had reductions of 94.7% for the warm season and 99.0% for the cool season. Environmental Technologies had slightly larger reductions of 99.4% and 99.98% for the cool and warm season, respectively. As a result of such large reductions in ammonia emissions, both technologies meet the criteria to be classified as ESTs for ammonia emissions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Increased nitrogen emissions may lead to environmental impacts including photochemical air pollution, reduced visibility, changes in biodiversity, and stratospheric ozone depletion. In the last 50 yr, emissions of ammonia (NH.), which is the most abundant form of reduced reactive nitrogen in the atmosphere, have significantly increased as a result of intensive agricultural management and greater livestock production in many developed countries. These agricultural production practices are increasingly subject to governmental regulations intended to protect air resources. It is therefote important that an accurate and robust agricultural emission factors database exist to provide valid scientific support of these regulations. This paper highlights some of the recent work that was presented at the 2006 Workshop on Agricultural Air Quality in Washington, D.C. regarding NH3 emissions estimates and emission factors from agricultural sources in the U.S. and Europe. In addition, several best management practices are explored as the scientific community attempts to maximize the beneficial use of reactive nitrogen while simultaneously minimizing negative environmental impacts.

However, soluble sugars produced photosynthetically must also be exported to support growth processes in heterotrophic tissues. To begin to address how vacuolar sugar storage and assimilate partitioning are regulated in A. comosus, degenerate PCR and cDNA library screening were used to clone three candidate sugar transporters from the leaves of this species. Subcellular localization of the three transporters was investigated via expression of YFP-fusion proteins in tobacco epidermal cells and their co-localization with subcellular markers by confocal microscopy. Using this strategy, a putative hexose transporter (AcMST1) and a putative inositol transporter (AcINT1) were identified that both localized to the tonoplast, whereas a putative sucrose transporter (AcSUT1) was found to localize to prevacuolar compartments. A cDNA (AcMST2) with high similarity to a recently characterized tonoplast hexose transporter in Arabidopsis was also identified from an A. comosus fruit EST database. Analyses of transcript abundance indicated that AcMST1 was more highly expressed in fruits compared to leaves of A. comosus, whilst transcripts of AcINT1, AcSUT1, and AcMST2 were more abundant in leaves. Transcript abundance of AcINT1, the putative inositol transporter, showed day-night changes comparable to those of other CAM-related transcripts described in Mesembryanthemum crystallinum. The results are discussed in terms of the role of vacuolar sugar transporters in regulating carbon flow during the diel cycle in CAM plants. © The Author [2008].

In solid waste collection process, the trucks emit to environment different emissions from its exhausts. For this reason, in solid waste collection process, it is necessary that route optimization should be performed in order to decrease the emissions. This study was performed in Trabzon City with 39 districts, a shortest path model was used in order to optimize solid waste collection/hauling processes to minimize emission. Unless it performs route optimization in solid waste collection/hauling process, emissions increase due to empty miles negativeness. A software was used as an optimization tool. The software provided Geographical Information System (GIS) elements such as numerical pathways, demographic distribution data, container distribution data and solid waste production data. In addition, mematic container layer was having 777 points for the entire city. By using the software, the optimized route was compared with the present route. If the optimized route in solid waste collection system is used, route distance and route time will be decreased by 24-6 % and 44-3 % as mean of nine routes, respectively. By performing the stationary container collection process and route optimization, it is determined that CO2, NOx, HC, CO, PM emissions will be reduced 831-4, 12-8, 1-2, 0-4, 0-7 g per route, respectively.","Exhaust emission; GIS; Route optimization; Solid waste collection; Trabzon; Turkey","Diesel engines; Exhaust systems (engine); Geographic information systems; Optimization; Solid wastes; Waste management; Exhaust emission; Route optimization; Solid waste collection; Trabzon; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349165721

The effect of diurnal versus nocturnal damage on the initiation of plant defense responses was investigated using MecWorm, a robotic device designed to reproduce tissue damage caused by herbivore attack. Lima bean leaves that were damaged by MecWorm during the photophase emitted maximal levels of β-ocimene and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate in the late photophase. Leaves damaged during the dark phase responded with the nocturnal emission of (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, butwith only lowamounts of β-ocimene; this emission was followed by an emission burst directly after the onset of light. In the presence of 13CO2, this light-dependent synthesis of β-ocimene resulted in incorporation of 75% to 85% of 13C, demonstrating that biosynthesis of β-ocimene is almost exclusively fueled by the photosynthetic fixation of CO2 along the plastidial 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-P pathway. Jasmonic acid (JA) accumulated locally in direct response to the damage and led to immediate up-regulation of the P. lunatus β-ocimene synthase gene (PlOS) independent of the phase, that is, light or dark. Nocturnal damage caused significantly higher concentrations of JA (approximately 2-3 times) along with enhanced expression levels of PlOS. Transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana transformed with PlOS promoter::β- glucuronidase fusion constructs confirmed expression of the enzyme at the wounded sites. In summary, damage-dependent JA levels directly control the expression level of PlOS, regardless of light or dark conditions, and photosynthesis is the major source for the early precursors of the 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-P pathway. © 2007 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Phaseolus lunatus; Spodoptera littoralis; 2 C methylerythritol 4 phosphate; 2-C-methylerythritol 4-phosphate; 3 hexenylacetate; 3-hexenylacetate; acetic acid derivative; alkene; beta-ocimene; carbon; cyclopentane derivative; drug derivative; erythritol; jasmonic acid; ocimene; oxylipin; sugar phosphate; vegetable protein; animal; armyworm; article; bean; circadian rhythm; gene expression regulation; genetics; host parasite interaction; larva; light; metabolism; molecular genetics; parasitology; physiology; plant leaf; signal transduction; upregulation; volatilization; Acetates; Alkenes; Animals; Carbon Isotopes; Circadian Rhythm; Cyclopentanes; Erythritol; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Host-Parasite Interactions; Larva; Light; Molecular Sequence Data; Oxylipins; Phaseolus; Plant Leaves; Plant Proteins; Signal Transduction; Spodoptera; Sugar Phosphates; Up-Regulation; Volatilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48949120203

However, as it requires a sufficiently high temperature difference between ambient air and the building structure, this technique is highly sensitive to changes in climatic conditions. In order to quantify the impact of climate warming on the night-time ventilative cooling potential in Europe, eight representative locations across a latitudinal transect were considered. Based on a degree-hours method, site-specific regression models were developed to predict the climatic cooling potential (CCP) from minimum daily air temperature (Tmin). CCP was computed for present conditions (1961-90) using measured Tmin data from the European Climate Assessment (ECA) database. Possible time-dependent changes in CCP were assessed for 1990-2100, with particular emphasis on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 'A2' and 'B2' scenarios for future emissions of greenhouse gases and aerosols. Time-dependent, site-specific Tmin scenarios were constructed from 30 Regional Climate Model (RCM) simulated data sets, as obtained from the European PRUDENCE project. Under both emissions scenarios and across all locations and seasons, CCP was found to decrease substantially by the end of the 21st century. For the six Central and Northern European locations (47N) CCP was found to decrease in summer (June-August) by 20-50%. For the two Southern European locations (Madrid and Athens), future CCP was found to become negligible during the summer and to decrease by 20-55% during the spring and the autumn. The study clearly shows that night-time cooling potential will cease to be sufficient to ensure thermal comfort in many Southern and Central European buildings. In Central and Northern Europe, a significant passive cooling potential is likely to remain, at least for the next few decades. Upper and lower bound estimates for future CCP were found to diverge strongly in the course of the 21st century, suggesting the need for flexible building design and for risk assessments that account for a wide range of emissions scenarios and uncertainty in climate model results. La ventilation nocturne est souvent considre comme un concept de refroidissement passif prometteur. Toutefois, cette technique ncessitant une diffrence de temprature suffisamment leve entre l'air ambiant et la structure du btiment, elle est trs sensible aux changements des conditions climatiques. Pour quantifier l'impact du rchauffement climatique sur les possibilits de refroidissement par ventilation nocturne, on a considr huit emplacements reprsentatifs sur une transversale latitudinale en Europe. Sur la base d'une mthode 'degrs-heures', on a dvelopp des modles de rgression spcifiques des sites pour prvoir le potentiel de refroidissement climatique (CCP) partir de la temprature quotidienne minimale de l'air (Tmin). On a calcul le CCP pour les conditions prsentes pendant la priode 1961-90 en utilisant les donnes Tmin de la base de donnes ECA (Evaluation du climat europen). On a valu de possibles changements du CCP lis la dure pour la priode 1990-2100, en mettant l'accent sur les scnarios A2 et B2 du GIEC (Groupe d'experts intergouvernemental sur l'volution du climat) relatifs aux futures missions de gaz effet de serre et aux arosols. Des scnarios lis la dure, avec Tmin spcifiques aux sites ont t labors partir de 30 ensembles de donnes de modles de climats rgionaux simuls obtenus dans le cadre du projet europen PRUDENCE. Pour les deux scnarios d'mission et pour tous les emplacements et saisons, on a constat que le CCP diminuait de faon substantielle ds la fin du XXIe sicle. Pour les six emplacements en Europe centrale et en Europe du Nord (47 nord), on a constat que le CCP diminuait de 20-50% (juin-aot). Pour les deux emplacements en Europe du Sud (Madrid et Athnes), on a constat que le futur CCP devenait ngligeable pendant l't et diminuait de 20-55% pendant le printemps et l'automne. Cette tude montre clairement que le potentiel de refroidissement nocturne cessera d'tre suffisant pour assurer le confort thermique dans de nombreux btiments construits en Europe du Sud et en Europe centrale. En Europe centrale et en Europe du Nord, un potentiel significatif de refroidissement passif va vraisemblablement durer pendant au moins les prochaines dcennies. Il s'est avr que les estimations suprieures et infrieures du futur CCP divergeaient nettement dans le courant du XXIe sicle, ce qui suggre la ncessit de concevoir les btiments avec souplesse et d'valuer le risque en tenant compte d'une large gamme de scnarios d'mission et de l'incertitude des rsultats des modles climatiques.

To compute the transport of energy during the diffusion jump process, and then Q*, the processes of thermal activation to the transition state and the decay from the transition state are considered to be inverses; thus the net process is reduced to the analysis of the purely mechanical decay process. Molecular statics and dynamics are then suggested as the means to simulate the decay process and the case of carbon diffusion in body-centered cubic α-iron is so analyzed as an example. Our results show that, for the case Q* ≈ -Qm, where Qm is the activation energy for carbon diffusion, this is in agreement with experimental evidence reported in the literature. Thus both the sign and magnitude of Q* are correctly predicted.

A lignite coal was used for co-combustion. On-line concentrations of O2, CO, CO2, SO2, NOX and total hydrocarbons (CmHn) were measured in the flue gas during combustion experiments. Variations of emissions of various pollutants were studied by changing the operating parameters (excess air ratio, fluidization velocity, and fuel feed rate). Temperature distribution along the bed was measured with thermocouples. For co-combustion of apricot and peach fruit stones with a lignite coal, various ratios of biomass to coal ranging from 0 to 100 wt.% were tested. For the peach stone co-combustion tests, efficiencies are about 98% and for the apricot stone co-combustion tests, efficiencies ranged between 94.7% and 96.9% for 25%, 50% and 75% of apricot stone in the fuel mixture. The results of this study have shown that as the biomass ratio in the fuel mixture increases, the combustion takes place at the upper regions of the main column. This causes higher temperatures in the freeboard than the bed. Also the CO and hydrocarbon (CmHn) emissions increase as the biomass percentage increases in the fuel mixture. This causes decrease in the combustion efficiency. These results suggest that peach and apricot stones are potential fuels that can be utilized for clean energy production in small-scale fruit juice industries by using BFBC. The percentage of peach stones or apricot stones in the fuel mixture is suggested to be below 50 wt.% in order to obtain the emission limits of EU. During the design of the BFBC, one has to be careful about the volatile matter (VM) content of the biomass. For the complete combustion of the VM, longer freeboard or secondary air addition should be considered. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Moreover, grasslands support large populations of belowground herbivores that consume a major portion of plant biomass. The direct trophic link between herbivores and plants suggests that primary consumers may be particularly sensitive to rising CO2 concentrations; however, the responses of belowground grassland herbivores have rarely been investigated. Here, we report the response of a range of herbivorous nematode populations to elevated CO2 concentrations from three distinct grassland experiments. The three studies each involved 5-6 years of CO2 fumigation, utilized natural or representative plant and soil communities, and were sampled at the end of the growing season. In the vast majority of cases, elevated CO2 did not affect the abundance of nematode families; only two nematode families were significantly influenced by CO2 enrichment (Anguinidae increased in one case and Hoplolaimidae decreased in another). Similarly, elevated CO2 did not influence the total abundance, family richness, diversity or plant parasitic index of the herbivorous nematode community. These neutral responses to CO2 enrichment occurred despite increased root production in all three experiments, suggesting a simultaneous antagonistic mechanism may have operated, possibly decreased root quality and/or changes in the soil environment. Whatever the mechanism, our findings suggest that herbivorous nematodes in grassland ecosystems are resistant to rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Currently, only 40%, or 44.5 million metric tons, of coal combustion products (CCPs) generated in the United States each year by electric utilities are diverted from disposal in landfills or surface impoundments and recycled. Despite promising economic and environmental savings, there has been scant attention devoted to assessing life cycle impacts of CCP disposal and beneficial use. The objective of this paper is to present a life cycle inventory considering two cases of CCP management, including the stages of coal mining and preparation, coal combustion, CCP disposal, and CCP beneficial use. Six beneficial uses were considered: concrete production, structural fills, soil amendments, road construction, blasting grit and roofing granules, and wallboard. Methods. Primary data for raw material inputs and emissions of all stages considered were obtained from surveys and site visits of coal-burning utilities in Florida conducted in 2002, and secondary data were obtained from various published sources and from databases available in SimaPro 5.1 (PRé Consultants, Amersfoort, The Netherlands). Results. Results revealed that 50 percent of all CCPs produced, or 108 kg per 1,000 kg of coal combusted, are diverted for application in a beneficial use; however, the relative amounts sold by each utility is dependent on the process operating parameters, air emission control devices, and resulting quality of CCP. Diversion of 50% of all CCPs to beneficial use applications yields a decrease in the total raw materials requirements (with the exception of gravel and iron) and most emissions to air, water, and land, as compared to 100% disposal. Discussion. The greatest reduction of raw materials was attributed to replacing Portland cement with fly ash, using bottom ash as an aggregate in concrete production and road construction in place of natural materials, and substituting FGD gypsum for natural gypsum in wallboard. The use of fly ash as cementitious material in concrete also promised significant reductions in emissions, particularly the carbon dioxide that would be generated from Portland cement production. Beneficial uses of fly ash and gypsum showed reductions of emissions to water (particularly total dissolved solids) and emissions of metals to land, although these reductions were small compared to simply diverting 50% of all CCPs from landfills or surface impoundments. Conclusions. This life cycle inventory (LCI) provides the foundation for assessing the impacts of CCP disposal and beneficial use. Beneficial use of CCPs is shown here to yield reductions in raw material requirements and various emissions to all environmental compartments, with potential tangible savings to human health and the environment. Recommendations and Perspectives. Extension of this life cycle inventory to include impact assessment and sensitivity analysis will enable a determination of whether the savings in emissions reported here actually result in significant improvements in environmental and human health impacts. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Beneficial use; Coal combustion; Coal combustion products (CCPs); Disposal; Emissions; Florida; Life Cycle Inventory (LCI)","calcium sulfate; carbon dioxide; cement; coal; concrete; iron; air pollution; air pollution control; article; ash; building industry; building material; coal mining; combustion; comparative study; data base; device; dissolution; energy; fly ash; inventory control; landfill; life cycle assessment; materials; methodology; parameter; priority journal; processing; quality control; soil amendment; soil pollution; United States; waste disposal; waste management; water pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45349098853

Tightening of NOx and Particulate Matter (PM) limits further from Euro III to Euro IV levels has provoked the need of either controlling NOx from the engine measures and use PM control after-treatment devices such as Partial Flow Filters, or, controlling PM from the engine measures and use NOx control devices such as Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems. Manufacturers have adopted different strategies, depending upon the suitability, cost factors, infrastructure development and ease of maintenance of these systems. PM Metalit®, is a partial flow filter, which captures particulates coming out of the exhaust and re-generates on a continuous basis with the help of Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) in the exhaust. As NO2 content is generally less in a typical exhaust of a diesel engine, a Diesel Oxidation Catalyst should be used before the PM Metalit®, in order to generate NO2 from the Nitrogen Oxide (NO) available in the exhaust. The PM Metalit® systems have been in use in Europe for various OEM and Aftermarket applications for quite some time. India is poised to introduce Bharat Stage IV (Euro IV) emission norms from year 2010 in all major cities. Along with this, the utmost required diesel fuel with 50 ppm sulphur will also be introduced across these selected cities. The NOx emission reduction from Bharat Stage III to Bharat Stage IV level may be possible through further engine optimisation or Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) system optimization. For bringing down the particulate matter, partial flow PM Metalit® would be one of the options. Details of the PM Metalit® system, along with some of the results obtained on various world-wide applications so far, are presented in this paper.

Geological media suitable for CO2 storage through various physical and chemical trapping mechanisms must have the necessary capacity and injectivity, and must confine the CO2 and impede its lateral migration and/or vertical leakage to other strata, shallow potable groundwater, soils and/or atmosphere. Such geological media are mainly oil and gas reservoirs and deep saline aquifers that are found in sedimentary basins. Storage of gases, including CO2, in these media has been demonstrated on a commercial scale by enhanced oil recovery operations, natural gas storage and acid gas disposal. Some of the risks associated with CO2 capture and geological storage are similar to, and comparable with, any other industrial activity for which extensive safety and regulatory frameworks are in place. Specific risks associated with CO2 storage relate to the operational (injection) phase and to the post-operational phase, of which the risks of most concern are those posed by the potential for acute or chronic CO2 leakage from the storage site. Notwithstanding the global climate effect of CO2 returning to the atmosphere, the local risks to health and safety, environment and equity need to be properly assessed and managed. Currently there are very few operations in the world where CO2 is injected and stored in the ground, mostly if not exclusively as a by-product of an operation driven by other considerations than climate change, such as oil production or regulatory requirements regarding H2S. These operations show that there are no major technological barriers to CO2 geological storage, and that challenges and barriers lie elsewhere. A major challenge in the implementation of CO2 geological storage is the high cost of CO2 capture, particularly for dilute streams like those from power plants and industrial combustion processes. There are concerns that public opinion and public's acceptance or rejection of this technology will likely affect the large-scale implementation of CO2 geological storage. The current paucity of policy, legislation and a proper regulatory framework in most jurisdictions is presently the most significant barrier. The resolution of these challenges will affect the economics and financial risk of CO2 geological storage and will accelerate or delay the deployment of this technology for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.

Sci Total Environ 2007; submitted as companion manuscript.) the study area, acquisition of the one-year data set and qualitative analysis of the data set have been described. In Part II a source profile has been established for each activity present in the study area: 6 profiles (urban heating, solvent use, natural gas leakage, biogenic emissions, gasoline evaporation and vehicle exhaust) have been extracted from literature to characterise urban sources, 7 industrial profiles have been established via canister sampling around industrial plants (hydrocarbon cracking, oil refinery, hydrocarbon storage, lubricant storage, lubricant refinery, surface treatment and metallurgy). The CMB model is briefly described and its implementation is discussed through the selection of source profiles and fitting species. Main results of CMB modellings for the Dunkerque area are presented. (1) The daily evolution of source contributions for the urban wind sector shows that the vehicle exhaust source contribution varies between 40 and 55% and its relative increase at traffic rush hours is hardly perceptible. (2) The relative contribution of vehicle exhaust varies from 55% in winter down to 30% in summer. This decrease is due to the increase of the relative contribution of hydrocarbon storage source reaching up to 20% in summer. (3) The evolution of source contributions with wind directions has confirmed that in urban wind sectors the contribution of vehicle exhaust dominate with around 45-55%. For the other wind sectors that include some industrial plants, the contribution of industrial sources is around 60% and could reach 80% for the sector 280-310°, which corresponds to the most dense industrial area. (4) The pollution in Dunkerque has been globally characterised taking into account the frequency of wind directions and contributions of sources in each wind direction for the whole year.

Undertaking the first national-level climate impact assessment in Korea, we evaluated the impacts of climate change on Korea's 139 drainage subbasins, that have varying climate and complex topography. Subsequently, we estimated the spatial and temporal variations of water resources in each sub-basin under a climate change simulation. This simulation was based on high-resolution data (27 × 27 km) that were created by the Korean Meteorological Research Institute using the climate models ECHO-G and NCAR/MM5. In order to generate the climate and runoff simulations for each sub-basin, we used the LARS-WG model, a stochastic weather generator, and the PRMS hydrologic model. The results indicated that the amount of runoff was expected to decrease in spring and summer and to increase in fall and winter. Runoff amounts were also expected to increase in northern regions and decrease in southern regions. In addition, relative changes in water balance components - precipitation, evapotranspiration, and runoff - are investigated. These variations in the timing and amount of runoff under climate change could have significant implications for the sustainable management of water resources in Korea. © Inter-Research 2008.","Climate-change impact; Hydrological model; Korea; Regionalization; Water resources","Climate change; Computer simulation; Evapotranspiration; Hydrology; Precipitation (meteorology); Runoff; Topography; climate change; climate modeling; environmental impact; hydrological modeling; runoff; water budget; water resource; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44249099078

The syngas, after filtration and compression, feeds two gas turbines. In turn, the exhaust from the gas turbines, after post-combustion with char and tar, drives a steam turbine power plant. Before being discharged, the flue gas is processed in a selective catalytic reduction (SCR) unit to reduce CO, VOC and NOx content and is filtered to remove particulate matter. This innovative approach to energy recovery from MSW combines high energy efficiency with a low level of polluting emissions. The estimated global efficiency of the plant, referred to the LHV of the MSW, is around 28-30%, a much higher value than ordinarily obtained in traditional waste incineration plants. The environmental analysis includes a study of the polluting emissions and the simulation of their concentration in the area surrounding the plant: the emissions of the plant have a negligible influence on the original polluting levels of the settlement area. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Stable isotope techniques have a crucial role to play in the attribution of N2O emissions to different microbial processes, through estimation (natural abundance, site preference) or quantification (enrichment) of processes based on the 15N and 18O signatures of N2O determined by isotope ratio mass spectrometry. These approaches have the potential to become even more powerful when linked with recent developments in secondary isotope mass spectrometry, with microbial ecology, and with modelling approaches, enabling sources of N2O to be considered at a wide range of scales and related to the underlying microbiology. Such source partitioning of N2O is inherently challenging, but is vital to close the N 2O budget and to better understand controls on the different processes, with a view to developing appropriate management practices for mitigation of N2O. In this respect, it is essential that as many of the contributing processes as possible are considered in any study aimed at source attribution, as mitigation strategies for one process may not be appropriate for another. To aid such an approach, here the current state of the art is critically examined, remaining challenges are highlighted, and recommendations are made for future direction.

However, few studies have quantified spatial variation in plant δ13C at the landscape scale. We determined variation in leaf δ13C, leaf nitrogen per leaf area (Narea), and specific leaf area (SLA) in April and August 2005 for all individuals of three common woody species within a 308 × 12-m belt transect spanning an upland-lowland topoedaphic gradient in a subtropical savanna in southern Texas. Clay content, available soil moisture, and soil total N were all negatively correlated with elevation. The δ13C values of Prosopis glandulosa (deciduous N2-fixing tree legume), Condalia hookeri (evergreen shrub), and Zanthoxylum fagara (evergreen shrub) leaves increased 1-4‰ with decreasing elevation, with the δ13C value of P. glandulosa leaves being 1-3‰ higher than those of the two shrub species. Contrary to theory and results from previous studies, δ13C values were highest where soil water was most available, suggesting that some other variable was overriding or interacting with water availability. Leaf Narea was positively correlated with leaf δ13C of all species (p &lt; 0.01) and appeared to exert the strongest control over δ13C along this topoedaphic gradient. Since leaf Narea is positively related to photosynthetic capacity, plants with high leaf Narea are likely to have low p I/p a ratios and therefore higher δ13C values, assuming stomatal conductance is constant. Specific leaf area was not correlated significantly with leaf δ13C. Following a progressive growing season drought in July/August, leaf δ13C decreased. The lower δ13C in August may reflect the accumulation of 13C-depleted epicuticular leaf wax. We suggest control of leaf δ13C along this topoedaphic gradient is mediated by leaf N area rather than by stomatal conductance limitations associated with water availability. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Carbon isotope discrimination; Leaf nitrogen; Photosynthetic capacity; Soil moisture; Specific leaf area","carbon; rain; water; carbon isotope; deciduous tree; nitrogen; photosynthesis; plant water relations; savanna; shrub; soil moisture; spatial variation; stomatal conductance; subtropical region; water availability; woody plant; angiosperm; article; chemistry; ecosystem; geography; metabolism; physiology; plant leaf; season; soil; species difference; temperature; Angiosperms; Carbon; Carbon Isotopes; Ecosystem; Geography; Plant Leaves; Rain; Seasons; Soil; Species Specificity; Temperature; Water; North America; Texas; United States; Condalia hookeri; Prosopis; Prosopis glandulosa; Zanthoxylum; Zanthoxylum fagara",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43349088688

The Apheis network estimated the number of potential premature deaths from all causes that could be prevented by reducing PM 2.5 annual levels to 25 μg/m3, 20 μg/m3, 15 μg/m3 and 10 μg/m3 in 26 European cities. The various PM2.5 concentrations were chosen as different reductions based on the limit values proposed by the new European Directive, the European Parliament, the US Environmental Protection Agency and the World Health Organization, respectively. The Apheis network provided the health and exposure data used in this study. The concentration-response function (CRF) was derived from the paper by Pope et al (2002). If no direct PM2.5 measurements were available, then the PM10 measurements were converted to PM 2.5 using a local or an assumed European conversion factor. We performed a sensitivity analysis using assumptions for two key factors - namely, CRF and the conversion factor for PM2.5. Specifically, using the ""at least"" approach, in the 26 Apheis cities with more than 40 million inhabitants, reducing annual mean levels of PM2.5 to 15 μg/m 3 could lead to a reduction in the total burden of mortality among people aged 30 years and over that would be four times greater than the reduction in mortality that could be achieved by reducing PM2.5 levels to 25 μg/m3 (1.6% vs 0.4% reduction) and two times greater than a reduction to 20 μg/m3. The percentage reduction could grow by more than seven times if PM2.5 levels were reduced to 10 μg/m3 (3.0% vs 0.4%). This study shows that more stringent standards need to be adopted in Europe to protect public health, as proposed by the scientific community and the World Health Organization.",,"air quality; ambient air; health policy; mortality; particulate matter; public health; risk assessment; sensitivity analysis; World Health Organization; air quality; article; health behavior; health care; mortality; particulate matter; population growth; public health service; sensitivity analysis; world health organization; Adult; Aged; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Health; Environmental Monitoring; Europe; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mortality; Particulate Matter; Public Health; Urban Health; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849153576

Emissions were calculated for individual buildings as a product of internal concentration and ventilation rate, which were estimated by a carbon dioxide balance method. Relative humidity and temperature were also measured. The overall mean emission rates of NH3, total bacteria, respirable endotoxins, inhalable particles, and respirable particles per 500 kg live weight from Australian piggery buildings were 1442.5 mg h-1, 82.2 × 106 cfu h-1, 20.1 × 103 EU h-1, 1306.7 mg h-1, and 254.7 mg h-1, respectively. Internal concentrations of key airborne pollutants have been reported in companion articles. Building characteristics and management systems used in the piggeries were documented at the time of sampling and used in the subsequent statistical modeling of variations in pollutant emission rates. The emissions model used all statistically significant factors identified during prior modeling conducted for individual pollutant concentrations and ventilation airflow.

These species were selected due to their abundance in the estimated domain (47,000 km2) of the Kinki region. BVOC emission experiments were conducted in a growth chamber where temperature and light intensity can be controlled. Temperature was set at the average summer temperature in Osaka and at 5 °C above average. Light intensity was set at 1000, 335, and 0 μmol m-2 s-1 during day time. The amount of BVOC emission was high around noon due to the rise of ambient temperature. It was also found that the total emission rates and compositions of BVOC varied significantly among the plant species. Q. serrata, Q. crispula, F. crenata, Q. acutissima Carruthers, Q. glauca, and Q. myrsinaefolia emitted isoprene and showed emission dependence on light intensity and temperature. C. japonica, P. densiflora, C. obtusa, and O. sativa emitted monoterpenes and also showed emission dependence on temperature; however, only C. japonica and P. densiflora showed emission dependence on light intensity. Using BVOC emissions data from 10 plant species and forest data, BVOC emission potential maps were made. The emission of isoprene and monoterpenes from the Kinki region were estimated to be 596 and 54 ton h-1, respectively. Seasonal and diurnal variations of BVOC emissions potential were also estimated. Of note, though the amount of monoterpenes from O. sativa is small, it contributes approximately 5% to the total monoterpene emissions due to the huge land area covered by paddy fields. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Here, a study is made of the effects of these canopy dissimilarities combined with the snow-induced changes in length of growing season on seasonal gross primary production (GPP). • Methods: Leaf area index (LAI) and community-aggregated values of leaf angle and leaf nitrogen content were estimated for seven alpine plant canopies distributed along a marked snowmelt gradient, and these were used as input variables in a sun-shade canopy bulk-photosynthesis model. The model was validated for plant communities of early and late snowmelt sites by measuring the instantaneous CO2 fluxes with a canopy closed-chamber technique. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to estimate the relative impact of canopy properties and environmental factors on the daily and seasonal GPP. • Key Results: Carbon uptake was primarily related to the LAI and total canopy nitrogen content, but not to the leaf angle. For a given level of photosynthetically active radiation, CO 2 assimilation was higher under overcast conditions. Sensitivity analysis revealed that increase of the length of the growing season had a higher effect on the seasonal GPP than a similar increase of any other factor. It was also found that the observed greater nitrogen content and larger LAI of canopies in late-snowmelt sites largely compensated for the negative impact of the reduced growing season. • Conclusions: The results emphasize the primary importance of snow-induced changes in length of growing season on carbon uptake in alpine temperate meadows. It was also demonstrated how using leaf-trait values of the dominants is a useful approach for modelling ecosystem carbon-cycle-related processes, particularly when continuous measurements of CO2 fluxes are technically difficult. The study thus represents an important step in addressing the challenge of using a plant functional-trait approach for biogeochemical modelling. © The Author 2008.

Here, we show that CA12 is robustly regulated by estrogen via ERA in breast cancer cells, and that this regulation involves a distal estrogen-responsive enhancer region. Upon the addition of estradiol, ERα binds directly to this distal enhancer in vivo, resulting in the recruitment of RNA polymerase II and steroid receptor coactivators SRC-2 and SRC-3, and changes in histone acetylation. Mutagenesis of an imperfect estrogen-responsive element within this enhancer region abolishes estrogen-dependent activity, and chromosome conformation capture and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays show that this distal enhancer communicates with the transcriptional start site of the CA12 gene via intrachromosomal looping upon hormone treatment. This distal enhancer element is observed in the homologous mouse genomic sequence, and the expression of the mouse homologue, Car12, is rapidly and robustly stimulated by estradiol in the mouse uterus in vivo, suggesting that the ER regulation of CA12 is mechanistically and evolutionarily conserved. Our findings highlight the crucial role of ER in the regulation of the CA12 gene, and provide insight into the transcriptional regulatory mechanism that accounts for the strong association of CA12 and ER in human breast cancers. ©2008 American Association for Cancer Research.",,"carbonate dehydratase IX; estradiol; estrogen receptor; estrogen receptor alpha; nuclear receptor coactivator 2; RNA polymerase II; selective estrogen receptor modulator; steroid receptor coactivator 3; carbonate dehydratase; carbonate dehydratase XII; estradiol; estrogen receptor alpha; luciferase; selective estrogen receptor modulator; acetylation; animal experiment; article; breast cancer; chromatin immunoprecipitation; controlled study; estrogen responsive element; female; gene expression; gene sequence; human; human cell; mouse; mutagenesis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein modification; animal; breast tumor; C57BL mouse; cell culture; chromatin; DNA responsive element; drug effect; enhancer region; enzymology; gene expression regulation; genetic transfection; genetics; metabolism; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; physiology; sequence homology; Animals; Base Sequence; Breast Neoplasms; Carbonic Anhydrases; Chromatin; Enhancer Elements (Genetics); Estradiol; Estrogen Receptor alpha; Female; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Humans; Luciferases; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Molecular Sequence Data; Response Elements; Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Transfection; Tumor Cells, Cultured",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44849142755

Several lubricants are now decorated with this label in Europe, a label also known as ""La Marguerite"". In some countries there are laws that require the use of such lubricants for some purposes. The movement toward eco labels in Europe began in the 1980's with water pollution caused by two stroke cycle gasoline engines on Lake Constance. Lubricants entered the water from loss lubrication and leakage. Today environmentally acceptable lubricants are in demand for outboard two stroke engine oils, chain saw oils, wheel flange lubricants, rope lubricants, central lubrication system lubricants for trucks, hydraulic oils for forestry and agricultural equipment, sluices and sewage disposal plants, and civil engineering applications, snow mobile and ski slope equipment lubricants, and concrete shutting fluids. Eco-toxicity and biodegradability are to be considered in designing a lubricant. An environmentally acceptable lubricant biodegrades rapidly, is non-toxic against humans, fish, and bacteria. Eco labels for lubricants consider the lubricant eco-toxicological and technical properties, and production properties and equipment. The first eco label in Europe was the ""Blue Angel"" label in Germany. In Scandinavia the ""White Swan"" and in Austria the ""Umwelt Zeichen"" labels were used. In May 2004, the European Parliament passed a revised Community Eco-label Award scheme EC Regulation No. 1980/2000 to promote products of reduced harm to water and soil during use and that lead to reduced carbon dioxide emissions. These criteria are characterized by R-Phrases indicating environmental and human health hazards (R stands for Risk), additional aquatic requirements, and biodegradability and bio-accumulative potential. These criteria are detailed. With respect to the use of renewable raw materials in formulating the lubricants, the carbon content should be > 50% for hydraulic oils; > 45% for greases, > 70% for chain saw oils, concrete release agents, and other loss lubricants, and > 50% for two stroke engine oils. Hydraulic fluids must meet the technical performance criteria of ISO 15380. Greases have to be ""fit for purpose"". Chain saws must meet the technical performance criteria of RAL-UZ-48 of the Blue Angel. Concrete release agents and other loss lubricants shall be fit for purpose.

Model results consistently resolved 10 factors that are interpreted as two secondary, five industrial, one motor vehicle, one road dust, and one biomass burning sources. The STN dataset is generally not corrected for field blank levels, which are significant in the case of organic carbon (OC). Estimation of primary OC using the elemental carbon (EC) tracer method applied on a seasonal basis significantly improved the model's performance. Uniform increase of input data uncertainty and exclusion of a few outlier samples (associated with high potassium) further improved the model results. However, it was found that most PMF factors did not cleanly represent single source types and instead are ""contaminated"" by other sources, a situation that might be improved by controlling rotational ambiguity within the model. Secondary particulate matter formed by atmospheric processes, such as sulfate and secondary OC, contribute the majority of ambient PM2.5 and exhibit strong seasonality (37 ± 10% winter vs. 55 ± 16% summer average). Motor vehicle emissions constitute the biggest primary PM 2.5 mass contribution with almost 25 ± 2% long-term average and winter maximum of 29 ± 11%. PM2.5 contributions from the five identified industrial sources vary little with season and average 14 ± 1.3%. In summary, this study demonstrates the utility of the EC tracer method to effectively blank-correct the OC concentrations in the STN dataset. In addition, examination of the effect of input uncertainty estimates on model results indicates that the estimated uncertainties currently being provided with the STN data may be somewhat lower than the levels needed for optimum modeling results.

It catalyzes the irreversible conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate into pyruvate and is under allosteric control. In Corynebacterium glutamicum, this enzyme was regarded as promising target for improved production of lysine, one of the major amino acids in animal nutrition. In pyruvate kinase deficient strains the required equimolar ratio of the two lysine precursors oxaloacetate and pyruvate can be achieved through concerted action of the phosphotransferase system (PTS) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), whereby a reduced amount of carbon may be lost as CO2 due to reduced flux into the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle. In previous studies, deletion of pyruvate kinase in lysine-producing C. glutamicum, however, did not yield a clear picture and the exact metabolic consequences are not fully understood. Results: In this work, deletion of the pyk gene, encoding pyruvate kinase, was carried out in the lysine-producing strain C. glutamicum lysCfbr, expressing a feedback resistant aspartokinase, to investigate the cellular response to deletion of this central glycolytic enzyme. Pyk deletion was achieved by allelic replacement, verified by PCR analysis and the lack of in vitro enzyme activity. The deletion mutant showed an overall growth behavior (specific growth rate, glucose uptake rate, biomass yield) which was very similar to that of the parent strain, but differed in slightly reduced lysine formation, increased formation of the overflow metabolites dihydroxyacetone and glycerol and in metabolic fluxes around the pyruvate node. The latter involved a flux shift from pyruvate carboxylase (PC) to PEPC, by which the cell maintained anaplerotic supply of the TCA cycle. This created a metabolic by-pass from PEP to pyruvate via malic enzyme demonstrating its contribution to metabolic flexibility of C. glutamicum on glucose. Conclusion: The metabolic flux analysis performed illustrates the high flexibility of the metabolic network of C. glutamicum to compensate for external perturbation. The organism could almost maintain its growth and production performance through a local redirection of the metabolic flux, thereby fulfilling all anabolic and catabolic needs. The formation of the undesired overflow metabolites dihydroxyacetone and glycerol, in the deletion mutant, however, indicates a limiting capacity of the metabolism down-stream of their common precursor glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and opens possibilities for further strain engineering. © 2008 Becker et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"2 propanol; aspartate kinase; glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate; glycerol; lysine; phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase; phosphotransferase; pyruvate kinase; tricarboxylic acid; article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; biomass production; Corynebacterium glutamicum; deletion mutant; enzyme activity; enzyme metabolism; gene deletion; glucose transport; microbial biomass; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; protein expression; Animalia; Corynebacterium glutamicum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42449109972

The radiation protection group of the INFN-LNF participated to the intercomparison with a Bonner sphere spectrometer equipped with an active 6LiI (Eu) scintillator and a set of passive detectors, namely MCP-6s (80 mg cm- 2)/MCP-7 TLD pairs from TLD Poland. Both active and passive spectrometers, independently tested and calibrated, were used to determine the field and dosimetric quantities in the measurement point. The FRUIT unfolding code, developed at the INFN-LNF radiation protection group, was used to unfold the raw BSS data. This paper compares the results of the active or passive spectrometers, obtaining a satisfactory agreement in terms of both spectrum shape and value of the integral quantities, as the neutron fluence or the ambient dose equivalent. These results allow qualifying the BSS based on TLD pairs as a reliable passive method to be used around high energy particle accelerators even in low dose rate areas. This is particularly useful in those workplaces where the active instruments could be disturbed by the presence of pulsed fields, large photon fluence or electromagnetic noise. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The mechanism of plasma production comprises several common phenomena at the target surface, at the plasma-target interface and in the plasma expansion region. Atom vaporization and electron emission due to target heating by high intensity laser radiation and the plasma were considered. The heat flux from the plasma is convected by ions and returned electrons. At the plasma-target interface, an electrical sheath appears in which all charged particles are accelerated. The accelerated electron emission beam conveys energy into the plasma and together with partial absorption of the laser energy heats the plasma electrons. A mathematical model was formulated, which describes the phenomena in the solid target, space charge sheath, electron beam relaxation region, plasma expansion region and the Knudsen layer, where the vapor flux from the target was formed. The model allows determination of the target temperature, plasma density and plasma temperature, potential drop in the sheath and electrical field at the target surface, electron and ion current density, the rate of target vaporization, vapor degree of ionization and plasma velocity for the model was applied to an example of an Al target, with laser pulse durations of 1ns, 10, 103 and 10ms and laser power density of qL=10-3-1GW/cm2.

These advantages are related to the peculiar distribution of energy released by these particles in the traversed matter both at the macroscopic and at the microscopic scale. Besides the favourably dose distribution, there is a variety of positive radiobiological features related to the microscopic distribution of energy deposition. An important feature is the increase in ionisation density (revealed by the increase in Linear Energy Transfer: LET) as the beam penetrates the tissues, and this is associated in some cases to a significant increase of the Relative Biological Effectiveness (RBE) in the tumour volume with respect to the normal traversed tissues. Indeed, among the light ions that have been considered for hadrontherapy, the carbon ions give the optimal ratio between RBE along the Spread Out Bragg Peak (SOBP) and that at the entrance region. Proton beams, which are easier to accelerate and to deliver to the patient, have an RBE which does not change much with depth, showing a significant rise only at the distal part of the SOBP. Moreover, as ionisation density (and LET) increases with depth, there are changes in radiobiological properties other than RBE. In fact, it is expected that at the tumour site, in addition to the more effective cell killing: i) the oxygen effect may be lower, suggesting a possible decrease in recurrences due to hypoxic, radioresistant cells; ii) the radioresistance increase in some phases of the cell cycle is reduced; iii) the fractionation regimens scarcely affect the tumour sterilization while helping in sparing the traversed healthy tissue. After the above description of the rationale for the therapeutic use of charged hadrons, this paper briefly reviews the measured radiobiological properties of therapeutic hadron beams together with some relevant biophysics model aimed at their interpretation and at predicting the biological effects in mixed radiation fields. The problem of deriving a ""clinical"" RBE from the ""biological"" one is also shortly described, considering separately the proton and carbon ions cases. For the former case the simplifying assumption of RBE = 1.1 (and criticisms to it) currently adopted in general by the proton therapy Centres is described, while for the latter case the main two approaches (developed in Japan and in Germany) are outlined. Finally, the importance of gaining a better knowledge in hadron radiobiology is addressed, with respect to both the basic aspects and therapeutic applications of these particles. This need is put into the perspective of the increasing number of hadrontherapy facilities in the world and in Italy in particular, a fact that stimulates improving the existent approaches for treatment planning and that at the same time gives a unique opportunity for research at these Centres by devoted beam lines and related experimental facilities.","Carbon ions; Hadrontherapy; Protons; Radiation biology; Radiotherapy; Relative biological effectiveness",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40349106071

ENDOTELON consists of a complex of procyanidolic oligomers extracted from the seeds of a variety of vine cultivated in the Bordeaux wine-growing region, and is prescribed for the treatment of chronic venous insufficiency and retinal lesions. Considering the difficulty in labelling the various constituents of the product, the labelling procedure was based on providing radioactive CO2 to the plant. After isolation and purification, 150 mg of active material (50 μCι) was administered orally to six healthy volunteers. Radioactivity was measured in the blood over time until 72 and 120 hours in the same subjects after drug administration. Urinary and faecal elimination was measured for a period of 167 hours. Urinary elimination of the radioactive compounds represented 12 to 27% of the administered dose and faecal elimination represented 47 to 75% depending on the subject. The radioactivity of the 14CO2 eliminated in the breath was also measured, and represented around 8% of the total radioactivity for the 72-hour period after administration.

Materials and methods: Analysis of consecutive patients with vulvar cancer who preoperatively underwent sentinel scintigraphy (planar and 3D-SPECT imaging) and CT or MRI. Body markers were used for exact anatomical co-registration and fusion datasets were reconstructed using SPECT and CT/MRI. The number and localisation of all intraoperatively identified and resected sentinel lymph nodes (SLN) were compared between planar and 3D fusion imaging. Results: Twenty six SLN were localized on planar scintigraphy. Twelve additional SLN were identified after SPECT and CT/MRI reconstruction, all of them were confirmed intraoperatively. In seven cases where single foci were identified at plSc, fusion imaging revealed grouped individual nodes and five additional localisations were discovered at fusion imaging. In seven patients both methods identified SLN contra lateral to the primary tumor site, but only fusion imaging allowed to localise iliac SLN in four patients. All SLN predicted on fusion imaging could be localised and resected during surgery. Conclusions: Fusion imaging using SPECT and CT/MRI can detect SLN in vulvar cancer more precisely than planar imaging regarding number and anatomical localisation.

The approach uses physical and climatological data combined with site-specific measurements of evaporative isotopic enrichment of 2H and 18O in lake water to measure lake residency and ungauged runoff to lakes. Mean water yields to individual lakes across the region over a 3-year period are estimated to range from 5 to 395 mm·year-1, with a standard deviation of two times the predicted estimates based on interpolation of gauged stream flow from broad-scale watersheds in the area. Comparison of the method with longer-term Water Survey of Canada hydrometric data suggests very similar average water yields for moderate- to large-sized watersheds. However, the isotope-based estimates appear to capture extreme low water yields in flat, disconnected areas and extreme high water yields in other areas thought to be related to stronger connections to regional groundwater flow systems. For aquatic ecosystems of northeastern Alberta, an area expected to be affected by acid deposition from regional oil sands development, continued refinement of the technique is important to accurately assess critical loads for ungauged systems, particularly those in low-yield settings. © 2008 NRC.",,"acid deposition; aquatic ecosystem; assessment method; comparative study; estimation method; gauge; hydrometry; isotopic analysis; lake water; mass balance; streamflow; water yield; Alberta; Canada; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949088744

When the exposure history is absent, or delayed, the diagnosis is more difficult and relies on recognising the importance of multi-system disease. We present a case of accidental carbon monoxide poisoning. Case presentation: A middle-aged man, who lived alone in his mobile home was found by friends in a confused, incontinent state. Initial signs included respiratory failure, cardiac ischaemia, hypotension, encephalopathy and a rash, whilst subsequent features included rhabdomyolysis, renal failure, amnesia, dysarthria, parkinsonism, peripheral neuropathy, supranuclear gaze palsy and cerebral haemorrhage. Despite numerous investigations including magnetic resonance cerebral imaging, lumbar puncture, skin biopsy, muscle biopsy and electroencephalogram a diagnosis remained elusive. Several weeks after admission, diagnostic breakthrough was achieved when the gradual resolution of the patient's amnesia, encephalopathy and dysarthria allowed an accurate history to be taken for the first time. The patient's last recollection was turning on his gas heating for the first time since the spring. A gas heating engineer found the patient's gas boiler to be in a dangerous state of disrepair and it was immediately decommissioned. Conclusion: This case highlights several important issues: The bewildering myriad of clinical features of carbon monoxide poisoning, the importance of making the diagnosis even at a late stage and preventing the patient's return to a potentially fatal toxic environment, and the paramount importance of the history in the diagnostic method. © 2008 Bennetto et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"carbon monoxide; adult; amnesia; anamnesis; article; brain disease; brain hemorrhage; carbon monoxide intoxication; case report; clinical feature; confusion; dysarthria; electroencephalogram; heart muscle ischemia; human; hypotension; incontinence; kidney failure; lumbar puncture; male; muscle biopsy; neuroimaging; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; parkinsonism; peripheral neuropathy; priority journal; progressive supranuclear palsy; rash; respiratory failure; rhabdomyolysis; skin biopsy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45149089297

Acid-gas-injection operations constitute a commercial-scale analog to CO2 injection in geological media as a climate-change mitigation measure. Deep saline aquifers provide a very large capacity for the sequestration of acid and greenhouse gases, being found in all sedimentary basins around the world. Proper understanding of the relative permeability-displacement character of such systems is essential in ascertaining gas injectivity and migration, and in assessing the suitability, containment, and safety of prospective injection sites. Pure CO2 and H2S represent the compositional end members of acid and greenhouse gases, hence the interest in measuring their displacement properties. This paper presents the detailed experimental equipment and protocols along with the results of a series of relative permeability measurements conducted at full reservoir conditions using supercritical pure CO2 and H2S on samples of intercrystalline sandstone, carbonate, shale, and anhydrite rocks from the Wabamun and Zama areas in Alberta, Canada, where large CO2 sources and several acid-gas-injection operations exist. Results of the relative permeability measurements are presented for each fluid and rock type.

From December 2003 to May 2004, acoustic estimates of Arctic cod biomass at a 225-m-deep station in central Franklin Bay (southeastern Beaufort Sea) increased progressively by 2 orders of magnitude, reaching maximum values of 2.7 and 55 kg m-2 in April. During accumulation in Franklin Bay, the fish occupied the lower part of the Pacific halocline (140 m to bottom), where the temperature-salinity signature (-1.4 to 0.3°C; 33 to 34.8 practical salinity units) corresponded to slope waters. Currents at 200 m along the western slope of Amundsen Gulf headed SSE in early winter, suggesting the passive advection of Arctic cod from Amundsen Gulf into Franklin Bay. Retention in Franklin Bay against the general circulation resulted from the fish keeping at depth to reduce predation by diving seals and/or to benefit from relatively warm temperatures in the lower halocline. Extrapolating a standing biomass of 11.23 kg m-2 at the station in April to the whole of Franklin Bay, the availability of polar cod would amply satisfy the requirements of predators. Dense accumulations of Arctic cod in embayments in winter likely play an important role in structuring the ecosystem of the Beaufort Sea.

First, mitigation, which actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and sequester or store carbon in the short-term, and make development choices that will lead to low emissions in the long-term. Second, adaptation, which involves adjustments in natural or human systems and behaviours that reduce the risks posed by climate change to people's lives and livelihoods. While the two are conceptually distinct, in practice they are very much interdependent, and both are equally urgent from a healthy population perspective. To define the policies to mitigate and to adapt to global climate change, data and information at all scales are the basic requirement for both developed and developing countries. However, as compared to mitigation, adaptation is an immediate concern for low-income countries and for small islands states, where the reduction of the emissions from greenhouse gases is not among their priorities. Adaptation is also highly location specific and the required ground data to assess the impacts of climate change on human health are not available. Climate data at high spatial resolution can be derived by various downscaling methods using historical and real-time meteorological observations but, particularly in low-income countries, the outputs are limited by the lack of ground data at the local level. In many of these countries, a negative trend in the number of meteorological stations as compared as to before 2000 is evident, while remotelysensed imagery becomes more and more available at high spatial and temporal resolution. The final consequence is that climate change policy options in the developing world are greatly jeopardized.","Climate change; Climate variability; Global warming; Human health; Meteorological observations; Remote sensing","article; environmental monitoring; greenhouse effect; human; methodology; policy; public health; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Public Health; Public Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54449084784

Spring events such as leafing and flowering have typically advanced, some by several weeks, with median advances of 4-5 d per degree Celsius. Autumn events, such as leaf coloring or leaf fall, have usually become delayed, though with more variability than spring events. Changes in summer events have been mixed. Phenological changes have varied geographically, as have recent temperature changes. Most studies of at least several decades duration show the initiation of rapid changes in the 1970s or 1980s, paralleling patterns of temperature change. Plants and animals in a given area have often responded at different rates to temperature change, which is likely to change patterns of interaction between plants and their pollinators and herbivores. Altitudinal changes in plant distributions have been demonstrated in several areas, especially in Scandinavia and in Mediterranean Europe, though these changes lag the measured temperature changes. Latitudinal changes in plant distribution have been demonstrated in only a few instances and it has been suggested that precipitation changes may have limited range shifts in response to warming in some areas. The observed and predicted changes in plant distribution and phenology have major implications for various ecological and evolutionary phenomena, including ecosystem productivity, species interactions, community structure, and conservation of biodiversity.","Climate change; Distribution limits; Flowering; Global warming; Leafing; Phenology","altitudinal zonation; biodiversity; climate change; community structure; conservation; flowering; global warming; phenology; population distribution; temperature; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43949108247

Quantitative stratigraphic analyses of bulk sediment composition, texture (% sand and coarse organic detritus), the C/N ratio of bulk organic matter, and magnetic susceptibility allowed us to define a common succession of sedimentary units in all three lakes. This common stratigraphy includes a basal unit of dry and stiff low-organic clays capped by a horizon of peaty mud or peat, overlain by organic lake sediment. We interpret this stratigraphy to represent an episode of (nearly) complete desiccation of these lake basins. This was followed first by an early phase of modest lake refilling, during which time extensive littoral and submerged vegetation developed, producing peaty lake deposits. Mostly higher lake levels later on resulted in deposition of fine-grained lake muds. Using 210Pb and 137Cs activity profiles combined with four AMS 14C dates on single terrestrial plant macrofossils or multiple charred grass particles indicate that in all three lakes the episode of most recent complete desiccation occurred in the late 18th and early 19th century. These results add to an accumulating body of palaeoenvironmental data revealing a prolonged period of extreme drought in equatorial East Africa about 200 years ago, also documented in the cultural history of the African Great Lakes region. Given the geographical spread of the study lakes across the East African plateau, these results indicate that the climatic anomaly of reduced rainfall responsible for this drought was at least sub-continental in scale. © 2007.","Lake Baringo; Lake-sediment records; Late Holocene; Palaeoclimate; Sediment stratigraphy; Tropical East Africa","desiccation; drought; eighteenth century; Holocene; lacustrine deposit; lithology; nineteenth century; paleoclimate; paleolimnology; precipitation intensity; stratigraphy; Africa; East Africa; Kenya; Sub-Saharan Africa; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40149097162

In the Amazon region, the direct threat of deforestation and degradation is now strongly intertwined with an indirect challenge we are just beginning to understand: the possibility of substantial regional drought driven by global climate change. The Amazon region hosts more than half of the world's remaining tropical forests, and some parts have among the greatest concentrations of biodiversity found anywhere on Earth. Overall, the region is estimated to host about a quarter of all global biodiversity. It acts as one of the major 'flywheels' of global climate, transpiring water and generating clouds, affecting atmospheric circulation across continents and hemispheres, and storing substantial reserves of biomass and soil carbon. Hence, the ongoing degradation of Amazonia is a threat to local climate stability and a contributor to the global atmospheric climate change crisis. Conversely, the stabilization of Amazonian deforestation and degradation would be an opportunity for local adaptation to climate change, as well as a potential global contributor towards mitigation of climate change. However, addressing deforestation in the Amazon raises substantial challenges in policy, governance, sustainability and economic science. This paper introduces a theme issue dedicated to a multidisciplinary analysis of these challenges. © 2008 The Royal Society.","Amazonia; Brazil; Climate change; Deforestation; Fire; Tropical forest","biodiversity; climate change; deforestation; drought; fire; global climate; governance approach; rainforest; soil carbon; sustainability; tropical forest; twenty first century; Amazonia; South America",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41649091576

Single orebodies, which are up to 3 km long along strike and several hundred meters wide, depending on dip of the beds, are strata bound and composed of two major ore types - namely, hard hematite ore that is of ancient geologic origin and ores related to recent weathering along a lateritized Cretaceous-Cenozoic land surface. The ancient hard hematite orebodies comprise laminated hematite ores in which microplaty hematite is dominant, and massive ores composed almost entirely of martite. Supergene ores, in contrast, are comprised of goethite-rich duricrust and soft saprolitic hematite ores representing the leached zone of the Cretaceous-Cenozoic laterite profile. Hard hematite-martite ores formed by hydrothermal replacement of BIF protolith, not only through leaching of silica but possibly also through introduction of iron by hydrothermal fluids of meteoric origin. Hematite iron ore pebbles in a conglomerate at the base of the Meso- to Neoproterozoic Kolhan Group near Noamundi attest to the antiquity of the hard hematite orebodies. Soft saprolitic iron ores formed as a product of lateritic weathering processes in Cretaceous-Cenozoic times. Supergene alteration took place under the influence of reducing and acidic meteoric water, which is typical for lateritic soil profiles developed under humid tropical climatic conditions with lush plant cover. Goethitic duricrusts capping the laterite profile suggest alternating wet and dry seasons in this environment. © 2008 Society of Economic Geologist Inc.",,"Drought; Erosion; Hematite; Iron; Iron ore treatment; Iron ores; Landforms; Leaching; Minerals; Ore deposits; Ore treatment; Oxide minerals; Silica; Silicate minerals; Silicon compounds; Soil mechanics; Soils; Weathering; Banded-iron formation (BIF); Cenozoic; Climatic conditions; Goethite (Gt); Hematite ores; High-grade hematite; Hydrothermal fluids; Land surfaces; Lateritic soils; Meteoric waters; Neoproterozoic; Ore-bodies; Paleoarchean; Protolith; Supergene alteration; Wet and dry seasons; Ores; Archean; banded iron formation; Cenozoic; Cretaceous; greenstone belt; hematite; hydrothermal fluid; iron ore; ore body; paragenesis; petrogenesis; protolith; supergene process; Asia; Eurasia; India; Jharkhand; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47849108949

In the current study, we used a renal epithelial cell line, the opossum kidney (OKP) cell, to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the long-term effects of PTH on NHE3 transport activity and expression. We observed that NHE3 activity was reduced 6 h after addition of PTH, and this reduction persisted almost unaltered after 24 h. The decrease in activity was associated with diminished NHE3 cell surface expression at 6, 16, and 24 h after PTH addition, total cellular NHE3 protein at 16 and 24 h, and NHE3 mRNA abundance at 24 h. The lower levels of NHE3 mRNA were associated to a small, but significant, decrease in mRNA stability. Additionally, by analyzing the rat NHE3 gene promoter activity in OKP cells, we verified that the regulatory region spanning the segment -152 to +55 was mildly reduced under the influence of PTH. This effect was completely abolished by the presence of the PKA inhibitor KT 5720. In conclusion, long-term exposure to PTH results in reduction of NHE3 mRNA levels due to a PKA-dependent inhibitory effect on the NHE3 promoter and a small reduction of mRNA half-life, and decrease in the total amount of protein which is preceded by endocytosis of the apical surface NHE3. The decreased NHE3 expression is likely to be responsible for the reduction of sodium, bicarbonate, and fluid reabsorption in the proximal tubule consistently perceived in experimental models of PTH disorders.

We analyzed whole ecosystem carbon exchange rates as well as nutrient dynamics, microbial and plant community composition and biomass after 2 years of experimental temperature increase. Plant biomass increased significantly with warming, mainly due to the strong response of lichens, the dominant plant group within this ecosystem. Experimental warming also increased soil nitrogen pools and nitrogen turnover rates. Major changes in soil microbial and plant composition, however, were not detected. Although experimental warming increased gross ecosystem productivity, the higher plant biomass did not compensate for the much greater increase in C losses. Ecosystem respiration and net ecosystem CO2 losses were significantly higher in warmed plots compared to control ones. We suggest that this was due to increased soil respiration, since soil carbon pools were lower in warmed soils, at least in the upper horizons. Our study thus supports the general hypothesis that tundra ecosystems turn from a carbon sink to a carbon source when temperatures increase in the short-term. Since lichens, which produce low quality litter, increased their biomass significantly with warming in this specific ecosystem type, CO2 losses may slow down in the long-term. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Arctic ecosystem; Carbon balance; Experimental warming; Microbial community structure; Nutrient cycling; Plant growth","arctic environment; carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; climate effect; community composition; community structure; experimental study; growth response; lichen; microbial activity; microbial community; nutrient dynamics; plant community; shrub; soil respiration; temperature effect; tundra; warming; Eurasia; Siberia; Embryophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43349093473

For the United Kingdom, we suggest that these concerns have increasingly become manifest in a new strand of political debate around energy policy, which reframes nuclear power as part of the solution to the need for low-carbon energy options. A mixed-methods analysis of citizen views of climate change and radioactive waste is presented, integrating focus group data and a nationally representative survey. The data allow us to explore how UK citizens might now and in the future interpret and make sense of this new framing of nuclear power-which ultimately centers on a risk-risk trade-off scenario. We use the term ""reluctant acceptance"" to describe how, in complex ways, many focus group participants discursively re-negotiated their position on nuclear energy when it was positioned alongside climate change. In the concluding section of the paper, we reflect on the societal implications of the emerging discourse of new nuclear build as a means of delivering climate change mitigation and set an agenda for future research regarding the (re)framing of the nuclear energy debate in the UK and beyond. © SAGE Publications.",,"article; classification; climate; environmental exposure; greenhouse effect; human; information processing; legal aspect; nuclear accident; nuclear power plant; policy; power supply; radioactive waste; risk assessment; social behavior; standard; statistics; United Kingdom; Climate; Electric Power Supplies; Environmental Exposure; Focus Groups; Great Britain; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Nuclear Power Plants; Public Policy; Radioactive Hazard Release; Radioactive Waste; Risk Assessment; Social Responsibility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40849135775

Chlorophyll a and phytoplankton production data indicated phosphorus (P) limitation in spring, nitrogen (N) and P co-limitation in summer, and no N or P limitation in autumn. Heterotrophic bacterial abundance, dissolved organic carbon levels, and plankton respiration were not stimulated by nutrient enrichment. Autotrophic biomass and production, but not heterotrophic biomass or respiration, were seasonally stimulated by the availability of P and/or N. Such imbalance between autotrophic and heterotrophic processes may contribute to the accumulation of phytoplankton biomass during the growing season. Cyanobacterial abundance in the lake increased from 22% of the plankton biomass in the spring when the TN:TP ratio was high to 68% in the autumn when the TN:TP ratio was low, suggesting that P availability helps drive a seasonal succession towards cyanobacterial dominance. © 2008, Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,"bioassay; biological production; chlorophyll a; cyanobacterium; eutrophication; growing season; metabolism; nutrient availability; nutrient limitation; phytomass; phytoplankton; urban ecosystem; Michigan; Mona Lake; North America; United States; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cyanobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39749094924

Although the role of the AHR in control of drug metabolism and endocrine disruption is partly understood, we know little about the regulation of the AHR itself by endocrine factors. Our work with hypophysectomized rats suggested that hepatic AHR protein level is positively regulated by pituitary-dependent factors. A current hypothesis is that adrenal glucocorticoids elevate AHR expression and enhance responsiveness to AHR agonists. Dexamethasone (DEX) at concentrations that activate the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) increased AHR mRNA, protein, and TCDD-binding by approximately 50% in Hepa-1 mouse hepatoma cells. This response was blocked by the GR antagonist 17β-hydroxy-11β-[4-dimethylamino phenyl]-17α-[1-propynyl]estra-4,9-dien-3-one (RU486), suggesting GR involvement. This small magnitude increase in AHR levels was functionally significant; pretreatment of Hepa-1 cells with DEX caused a 75% increase in the maximum induction of an AHR-activated luciferase reporter plasmid by TCDD. A luciferase reporter under control of the proximal 2.5 kilobases of the mouse Ahr 5′-flanking region and promoter was induced approximately 2.5-fold by DEX when cotransfected with a mouse GR expression plasmid. This is the first demonstration that glucocorticoids increase AHR levels in hepatoma cells via a GR-dependent transcriptional mechanism, suggesting a novel aspect of cross-talk between the AHR and the GR.

Effects on AIS include range shifts and more frequent overwintering of species. These effects may create new challenges for AIS management. We examined available U.S. state AIS management plans to assess each program's capacity to adapt to climate-change effects. We scored the adaptive capacity of AIS management plans on the basis of whether they addressed potential impacts resulting from climate change; demonstrated a capacity to adapt to changing conditions; provided for monitoring strategies; provided for plan revisions; and described funding for implementation. Most plans did not mention climate change specifically, but some did acknowledge climatic boundaries of species and ecosystem sensitivities to changing conditions. Just under half the plans mentioned changing environmental conditions as a factor, most frequently as part of research activities. Activities associated with monitoring showed the highest capacity to include information on changing conditions, and future revisions to management plans are likely to be the easiest avenue through which to address climate-change effects on AIS management activities. Our results show that programs have the capacity to incorporate information about climate-change effects and that the adaptive-management framework may be an appropriate approach. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.","Adaptive capacity; Adaptive management; Aquatic invasive species management plans; Climate change","water; adaptation; adaptive management; biomonitoring; climate change; climate effect; conservation planning; invasive species; management practice; overwintering; animal; article; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; greenhouse effect; methodology; standard; United States; Animals; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; United States; Water; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949207470

This study adopts the rare British lichen Vulpicida pinastri as a case study species and examines its ecological response to emerging threats: climate change and the recurrent loss of its primary habitat (juniper scrub). We used predictive niche modelling to examine the response of V. pinastri to a range of present-day climatic variables. A successful model was projected for a period during the 2050s based on IPCC climate change scenarios (UKCIP02 data), and threat was estimated as the proportional change in bioclimatic space. To estimate the potential range now and during the 2050s, projected bioclimatic space was masked by a habitat map equivalent to (i) the present-day distribution of juniper and (ii) theoretical juniper distribution based on existing rates of decline. Our results point to potential range loss of V. pinastri with climate warming, exacerbated by the recurrent decline in juniper habitat. This predictive modelling approach was complemented by an assessment of local stand-scale effects. At four sites in north-east Scotland we examined the occurrence and abundance of V. pinastri thalli, in response to juniper spatial distribution, and the life-stage and structure of individual shrubs. Vulpicida pinastri appeared to be dispersal limited at small-scales, and was significantly more abundant on old and degenerate juniper shrubs. Our results evidence a close relationship between management for habitat quality and effective lichen conservation. Effective conservation of V. pinastri must ensure cohorts of older and degenerate juniper shrubs are maintained at sites where the species is expected to be most resistant to long-term climate warming, i.e. in the uplands of north-east Scotland. © 2008 British Lichen Society.","Bioclimatic response; Juniperus communis; Niche-modelling; Nonparametric multiplicative regression; UKCIP02","Juniperus; Juniperus communis; Vulpicida pinastri",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849112632

Emerging carbon regulation in the US has the potential to affect existing markets for renewable energy. Carbon cap-and-trade programs are now under development in the Northeast under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) and in early stages of development in the West and Midwest. There is increasing discussion about carbon regulation at the national level as well. While renewable energy will likely benefit from carbon cap-and-trade programs because compliance with the cap will increase the costs of fossil fuel generation, cap-and-trade programs can also impact the ability of renewable energy generation to affect overall CO2 emissions levels and obtain value for those emissions benefits. This paper summarizes key issues for renewable energy markets that are emerging with carbon regulation, such as the implications for emissions benefits claims and voluntary market demand and the use of renewable energy certificates (RECs) in multiple markets.

The diversity target is only met when consumption is reduced by 10-15% and the constraint on maximum material throughput is relaxed. Re-structuring the mix and reducing consumption is insufficient to achieve a sustainable EU carbon footprint.

They have also previously been found to be important in the initial biopolymer degradation of sedimentary organic matter. The Flavobacteria community was analysed in inshore, marine sediments subject to regular inputs of highly labile organic carbon in order to understand the importance of this group in carbon degradation. We used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and real-time PCR in a statistically robust manner, over 2 consecutive years, to demonstrate that the number of Flavobacteria in the sediment increased and community composition shifted with organic loading. Further community shifts occurred after cessation of organic loading, and population numbers also decreased. Flavobacteria appear to be important in the initial responses of the sediment microbial community to organic loading, regardless of sediment type, but flavobacterial composition was not predictable. The highly dynamic nature and large diversity (functional redundancy) of the Flavobacteria in these sediments may contribute to this unpredictable response. © Inter-Research 2008.","Community composition; Degradation; Flavobacteria; Organic pollution","Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroides; Bacteroides (class); Bacteroidetes; Cytophaga; Flavobacteria; Flavobacterium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649186238

We examine whether CO2 prices could eventually replace the existing support schemes for wind and if they adequately capture its benefits. The analysis also looks at the effectiveness of the clean development and joint implementation mechanisms to trigger wind projects and technology transfer in developing countries. We find out that climate policy is unlikely to provide sufficient incentives to promote wind power, and that other policies should be used to internalise the societal benefits that accrue from deploying this technology: CO2 prices can only reflect the beneficial impact of wind on climate change but not its contribution to the security of supply or employment creation. A minimum price of around €40/tCO2 should be attained to maintain present support levels for wind and this excludes income risks and intermediation costs. Finally, CDM improves the return rate of wind energy projects in third countries, but it is the local institutional framework and the long-term stability of the CO2 markets that matters the most. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we focus on marine sedimentary records off Southern Chile that are archiving the regional paleoseismic history over the Holocene and Late Pleistocene. The investigated records - Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Site 1232 and SONNE core 50SL - are located at ~ 40°S and ~ 38°S, within the Perú-Chile trench, and are characterized by frequent interbedded strata of turbiditic and hemipelagic origin. On the basis of the sedimentological characteristics and the association with the active margin of Southern Chile, we assume that the turbidites are mainly seismically triggered, and may be considered as paleo-megaearthquake indicators. However, the long-term changes in turbidite recurrence times appear to be strongly influenced by climate and sea level changes as well. During sea level highstands in the Holocene and Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5, recurrence times of turbiditic layers are substantially higher, primarily reflecting a climate-induced reduction of sediment availability and enhanced slope stability. In addition, segmented tectonic uplift changes and related drainage inversions likely influenced the postglacial decrease in turbidite frequencies. Glacial turbidite recurrence times (including MIS 2, MIS 3, cold substages of MIS 5, and MIS 6), on the other hand, are within the same order of magnitude as earthquake recurrence times derived from the historical record and other terrestrial paleoseismic archives of the region. Only during these cold stages sediment availability and slope instability were high enough to enable recording of the complete sequence of large earthquakes in Southern Chile. Our data thus suggest that earthquake recurrence times on the order of 100 to 200 years are a persistent feature at least during the last glacial period. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Actually, the models for which the limiting effect of soil moisture upon evapotranspiration is already large in the present climate generally responds by a decrease of evapotranspiration whereas the other models generally exhibit an increase of evapotranspiration. The uncertainties in evapotranspiration changes seem to have an important impact in precipitation and temperature changes.

Good correlation with no significant bias (r2 = 0.67, slope = 0.99 ± 0.17, n = 12) is found for the ensemble of comparisons when the aircraft could spiral sufficiently low to sample most of the NO2 column. Urban spirals where large extrapolations were needed below the aircraft floor (1000 ft) showed poorer agreement. We use the OMI observations together with a global chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to estimate emissions of nitrogen oxides over the eastern United States and Mexico in March 2006. Comparison to EPA's National Emissions Inventory 1999 (NEI99) calls for a decrease in power plant emissions and an increase in on-road vehicle emissions relative to that inventory. The rise in vehicular emissions is offsetting the reduction in power plant and industry emissions. These findings are consistent with independent assessments.

Emissions for 2004-2005 totalled 1.4 Gt CO2-eq year-1 relative to total emissions from all sectors of 49 Gt CO2-eq year-1 [including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2 O), and F-gases normalized according to their 100-year global warming potentials (GWP)]. The CH4 from landfills and wastewater collectively accounted for about 90% of waste sector emissions, or about 18% of global anthropogenic methane emissions (which were about 14% of the global total in 2004). Wastewater N2O and CO2 from the incineration of waste containing fossil carbon (plastics; synthetic textiles) are minor sources. Due to the wide range of mature technologies that can mitigate GHG emissions from waste and provide public health, environmental protection, and sustainable development co-benefits, existing waste management practices can provide effective mitigation of GHG emissions from this sector. Current mitigation technologies include landfill gas recovery, improved landfill practices, and engineered wastewater management. In addition, significant GHG generation is avoided through controlled composting, state-of-the-art incineration, and expanded sanitation coverage. Reduced waste generation and the exploitation of energy from waste (landfill gas, incineration, anaerobic digester biogas) produce an indirect reduction of GHG emissions through the conservation of raw materials, improved energy and resource efficiency, and fossil fuel avoidance. Flexible strategies and financial incentives can expand waste management options to achieve GHG mitigation goals; local technology decisions are influenced by a variety of factors such as waste quantity and characteristics, cost and financing issues, infrastructure requirements including available land area, collection and transport considerations, and regulatory constraints. Existing studies on mitigation potentials and costs for the waste sector tend to focus on landfill CH4 as the baseline. The commercial recovery of landfill CH4 as a source of renewable energy has been practised at full scale since 1975 and currently exceeds 105 Mt CO2-eq year-1. Although landfill CH4 emissions from developed countries have been largely stabilized, emissions from developing countries are increasing as more controlled (anaerobic) landfilling practices are implemented; these emissions could be reduced by accelerating the introduction of engineered gas recovery, increasing rates of waste minimization and recycling, and implementing alternative waste management strategies provided they are affordable, effective, and sustainable. Aided by Kyoto mechanisms such as the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) and Joint Implementation (JI), the total global economic mitigation potential for reducing waste sector emissions in 2030 is estimated to be 1000 Mt CO2-eq (or 70% of estimated emissions) at costs below 100 US$ t-1CO2-eq year-1. An estimated 20-30% of projected emissions for 2030 can be reduced at negative cost and 30-50% at costs &lt; 20 US$ t-1 CO2-eq year-1. As landfills produce CH4 for several decades, incineration and composting are complementary mitigation measures to landfill gas recovery in the short- to medium-term - at the present time, there are &gt; 130 Mt waste year-1 incinerated at more than 600 plants. Current uncertainties with respect to emissions and mitigation potentials could be reduced by more consistent national definitions, coordinated international data collection, standardized data analysis, field validation of models, and consistent application of life-cycle assessment tools inclusive of fossil fuel offsets. © ISWA 2008.","Carbon dioxide; Emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gas; Incineration; IPCC; Landfill; Methane; Nitrous oxide; Waste; Waste water; Wmr 1315-2","Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Recycling; Waste incineration; Waste management; Wastewater; Reduced waste generation; Waste minimization; Gas emissions; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Recycling; Waste incineration; Waste management; Wastewater; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; emission control; global warming; greenhouse gas; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; methane; nitrous oxide; waste management; anaerobic digestion; article; carbon balance; climate change; composting; data analysis; data collection method; developed country; energy balance; environmental economics; environmental protection; environmental sanitation; global climate; government; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; incineration; international cooperation; landfill; life cycle assessment; nitrogen balance; policy; priority journal; public health; recycling; standardization; sustainable development; validation study; waste management; waste minimization; waste water management; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Incineration; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Refuse Disposal; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39649105427

Permafrost probability maps with 30 m × 30 m grid cells were generated for part of the Ruby Range, Yukon Territory (425 km2), and for the Haines Summit area, northern British Columbia (536 km2), using winter BTS measurements in conjunction with late-summer ground truthing by probing and digging pits to physically verify the presence of permafrost. BTS values, and hence permafrost distribution, were modeled using elevation and potential incoming solar radiation (PISR) for the Ruby Range. PISR was not significant at Haines Summit, probably because persistent cloudiness associated with its more maritime climatic regime reduced aspect-induced variability in insolation. Probability maps indicate that ∼66% of the Ruby Range area and ∼43% of the Haines Summit area are underlain by permafrost. Therefore, the Ruby Range should be classified as extensive discontinuous permafrost, while Haines Summit is part of the sporadic discontinuous permafrost zone and not the isolated patches zone as portrayed on recent maps. Extensive ground truthing proved to be an essential part of the procedure because traditional BTS ""rules-of-thumb"" did not remain valid across the differing mountain climate zones. © 2008 NRC Canada.",,"Crack propagation; Landforms; Maps; Precipitation (meteorology); Probability; Probability distributions; Basal temperatures; Grid cells; Northwest Canada; permafrost distribution; Probability mapping; Probability maps; Permafrost; basal temperature; cloud cover; insolation; mapping method; mountain environment; permafrost; prediction; probability; snow; solar radiation; spatial variation; British Columbia; Canada; Haines Summit; North America; Ruby Range; Yukon Territory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46749138324

Plant production in the boreal forest is nutrient limited, and we examined how long-term fertilization affected growth of white spruce Picea glauca in the face of these major changes. We conducted a large-scale experiment by fertilizing two 1 km2 stands of white spruce in the southwestern Yukon with commercial NPK fertilizer from 1987 to 1994. Tree growth was measured by the width of annual increments in 60 trees from each of 2 control and of 2 matched fertilized 1 km2 sites for the period from 1977 to 1997 in a before, during, and after experimental design. Ring widths increased in both control and fertilized trees over this period as summer temperatures increased. Ring widths in fertilized trees increased from 9 to 48% over control trees during the years in Which fertilizer was added, but immediately fell back to control levels from 1995 to 1997 at 1 site as soon as fertilization was stopped. In the long term, nitrogen in these forests may become tied up in shrubs, grasses, herbs, and fungi and not be available to the trees.

Major questions about life, climate, and geology require answers from state-of-the-art laboratories on Earth. Spacecraft instrumentation cannot perform critical measurements such as precise radiometric age dating, sophisticated stable isotopic analyses, and definitive life-detection assays. Returned sample studies could respond radically to unexpected findings, and returned materials could be archived for study by future investigators with even more capable laboratories. Unlike martian meteorites, returned samples could be acquired with known context from selected sites on Mars according to the prioritized exploration goals and objectives. The ND-MSR-SAG formulated the following 11 high-level scientific objectives that indicate how a balanced program of ongoing MSR missions could help to achieve the objectives and investigations described by MEPAG (2006). (1) Determine the chemical, mineralogical, and isotopic composition of the crustal reservoirs of carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, and other elements with which they have interacted and characterize carbon-, nitrogen-, and sulfur-bearing phases down to submicron spatial scales in order to document processes that could sustain habitable environments on Mars both today and in the past. (2) Assess the evidence for prebiotic processes, past life, and extant life on Mars by characterizing the signatures of these phenomena in the form of structure/morphology, biominerals, organic molecular and isotopic compositions, and other evidence within their geologic contexts. (3) Interpret the conditions of martian water-rock interactions through the study of their mineral products. (4) Constrain the absolute ages of major martian crustal geologic processes, including sedimentation, diagenesis, volcanism/plutonism, regolith formation, hydrothermal alteration, weathering, and cratering. (5) Understand paleoenvironments and the history of nearsurface water on Mars by characterizing the clastic and chemical components, depositional processes, and postdepositional histories of sedimentary sequences. (6) Constrain the mechanism and timing of planetary accretion, differentiation, and the subsequent evolution of the martian crust, mantle, and core. (7) Determine how the martian regolith was formed and modified and how and why it differs from place to place. (8) Characterize the risks to future human explorers in the areas of biohazards, material toxicity, and dust/granular materials and contribute to the assessment of potential in situ resources to aid in establishing a human presence on Mars. (9) For the present-day martian surface and accessible shallow subsurface environments, determine the preservation potential for the chemical signatures of extant life and prebiotic chemistry by evaluating the state of oxidation as a function of depth, permeability, and other factors. (10) Interpret the initial composition of the martian atmosphere, the rates and processes of atmospheric loss/gain over geologic time, and the rates and processes of atmospheric exchange with surface condensed species. (11) For martian climate-modulated polar deposits, determine their age, geochemistry, conditions of formation, and evolution through the detailed examination of the composition of water, CO2, and dust constituents, as well as isotopic ratios and detailed stratigraphy of the upper layers of the surface. MSR would attain its greatest value if samples are collected as sample suites that represent the diversity of the products of various planetary processes. Sedimentary materials likely contain complex mixtures of chemical precipitates, volcaniclastics, impact glass, igneous rock fragments, and phyllosilicates. Aqueous sedimentary deposits are important for performing measurements of life detection, observations of critical mineralogy and geochemical patterns, and trapped gases. On Earth, hydrothermally altered rocks can preserve a record of hydrothermal systems that provided water, nutrients, and chemical energy necessary to sustain microorganisms. They also might have preserved fossils in their mineral deposits. Hydrothermal processes alter the mineralogy of crustal rocks and inject CO2 and reduced gases into the atmosphere. Chemical alteration that occurs at nearsurface ambient conditions (typically &lt; ∼20°C) creates low-temperature altered rocks and includes, among other things, aqueous weathering and various nonaqueous oxidation reactions. Understanding the conditions under which alteration proceeds at low temperatures would provide important insight into the near-surface hydrological cycle, including fluid/rock ratios, fluid compositions (chemical and isotopic, as well as redox conditions), and mass fluxes of volatile compounds. Igneous rocks are expected to be primarily lavas and shallow intrusive rocks of basaltic composition. They are critical for investigations of the geologic evolution of the martian surface and interior because their geochemical and isotopic compositions constrain both the composition of mantle sources and the processes that affected magmas during generation, ascent, and emplacement. Regolith samples (unconsolidated surface materials) record interactions between crust and atmosphere, the nature of rock fragments, fine particles that have been moved over the surface, exchange of H2O and CO2 between near-surface solid materials and the atmosphere, and processes that involve fluids and sublimation. Regolith studies would help facilitate future human exploration by assessing toxicity and potential resources. Polar ices would constrain present and past climatic conditions and help elucidate water cycling. Surface ice samples from the Polar Layered Deposits (PLD) or seasonal frost deposits would help to quantify surface/atmosphere interactions. Short cores could help to resolve recent climate variability. Atmospheric gas samples would constrain the composition of the atmosphere and processes that influenced its origin and evolution. Trace organic gases (e.g., methane and ethane) could be analyzed for abundances, distribution, and relationships to a potential martian biosphere. Returned atmospheric samples that contain Ne, Kr, CO2, CH4, and C2H6 would confer major scientific benefits. Chemical and mineralogical analyses of martian dust would help to elucidate the weathering and alteration history of Mars. Given the global homogeneity of martian dust, a single sample is likely to be representative of the planet. A depth-resolved suite of samples should be obtained from depths that range from cm to several m within regolith or from rock outcrop to investigate trends in the abundance of oxidants (e.g., OH, HO2, H2O2, and peroxy radicals), the effects of radiation, and the preservation of organic matter. Other sample suites include impact breccias that might sample rock types that are otherwise not available locally, tephra consisting of fine-grained regolith material or layers and beds possibly delivered from beyond the landing site, and meteorites whose alteration history could provide insights into martian climatic history. The following factors would affect our ability to achieve MSR's scientific objectives: (1) Sample size. A full program of scientific investigations would likely require samples of ≥8 g for bedrock, loose rocks, and finer-grained regolith. To support required biohazard testing, each sample requires an additional 2 g, leading to an optimal size of 10 g. Textural studies of some rock types might require one or more larger samples of ∼20 g. Material should remain to be archived for future investigations. (2) Number of samples. Studies of differences between samples could provide more information than detailed studies of a single sample. The number of samples needed to address MSR scientific objectives effectively is 35 (28 rock, 4 regolith, 1 dust, 2 gas). If the MSR mission recovers the MSL cache, it should also collect 26 additional samples (20 rock, 3 regolith, 1 dust and 2 atmospheric gas). The total mass of these samples is expected to be about 345 g (or 380 g with the MSL cache). The total returned mass with sample packaging would be about 700 g. (3) Sample encapsulation. To retain scientific value, returned samples must not commingle, each sample must be linked uniquely to its documented field context, and rocks should be protected against fragmentation during transport. A smaller number or mass of carefully managed samples is far more valuable than a larger number or mass of poorly managed samples. The encapsulation of at least some samples must retain any released volatile components. (4) Diversity of the returned collection. The diversity of returned samples must be commensurate with the diversity of rocks and regolith encountered. This guideline substantially influences landing site selection and rover operation protocols. It is scientifically acceptable for MSR to visit only a single site, but visiting 2 independent landing sites would be much more valuable. (5) In situ measurements for sample selection and documentation of field context. Relatively few samples could be returned from the vast array of materials the MSR rover would encounter; thus we must be able to choose wisely. At least 3 kinds of in situ observations are needed (color imaging, microscopic imaging, and mineralogy measurement) and possibly as many as 5 (also elemental analysis and reduced-carbon analysis). No significant difference exists in the observations needed for sample selection vs. sample documentation. Revisiting a previously occupied site might result in a reduction in the number of instruments. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",,"astronomy; chemistry; methodology; microclimate; review; science; space flight; Extraterrestrial Environment; Mars; Science; Space Flight",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48849088529

Increased snow depth had a large effect on the temporal pattern of first date snow-free in spring, bud break, and flowering, but did not affect the rate of plant development. By contrast, snow depth had a large qualitative effect on N mineralization in deep snow zones, causing a shift in the timing and amount of N mineralized compared to ambient snow zones. Nitrogen mineralization in deep snow zones occurred mainly overwinter, whereas N mineralization in ambient snow zones occurred mainly in spring. Concentrations of soil dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) were approximately 5 times greater than concentrations of inorganic nitrogen (DIN) and did not vary significantly over the season.

The mtaA1, mtaA2, and mtbA genes of Methanosarcina acetivorans C2A encode putative methanol- or methylamine-specific MT2 enzymes. To address the in vivo roles of these genes in growth and methanogenesis from known substrates, we constructed and characterized mutants with deletions of each of these genes. The mtaA1 gene is required for growth on methanol, whereas mtaA2 was dispensable. However, the mtaA2 mutant had a reduced rate of methane production from methanol. Surprisingly, deletion of mtaA1 in combination with deletions of the genes encoding three methanol-specific MT1 isozymes led to lack of growth on acetate, suggesting that MT1 and MT2 enzymes might play an important role during growth on this substrate. The mtbA gene was required for dimethylamine and monomethylamine (MMA) utilization and was important, but not required, for trimethylamine utilization. Analysis of reporter gene fusions revealed that both mtaA1 and mtbA were expressed on all methanogenic substrates tested. However, mtaA1 expression was induced on methanol, while mtbA expression was down-regulated on MMA and acetate. mtaA2 was expressed at very low levels on all substrates. The mtaA1 transcript had a large 5′ untranslated region (UTR) (275 bp), while the 5′ UTR of the mtbA transcript was only 28 bp long. Copyright © 2008, American Society for Microbiology.

Many countries elected forest management activities and the resulting net balance of carbon emissions and removals of non-CO2 greenhouse gases by forest management in their climate change mitigation measures. In this paper a generic dynamic forestry model (FORMICA) is presented. It has an empirical basis. Several modules trace C pools relevant for the Kyoto Protocol and beyond: biomass, litter, deadwood and soil, and harvested wood products. The model also accounts for the substitution of fossil fuels by wood products and bioenergy. FORMICA was used to first study the model sensitivity and uncertainty based on data from Thuringia, a federal state of Germany, to determine the major sources of uncertainty in carbon accounting at different levels of carbon pool aggregation (biomass, ecosystem, forestry sector and enhanced forestry sector including the accumulated substitution effect). Rotation length and maximum increment contributed most to uncertainty in biomass. The influence of the latter did not diminish with higher level of pool aggregation. Uncertainty in the enhanced forestry sector was to a smaller degree controlled by product and substitution related parameters. Relative uncertainty decreased with the level of aggregation and comprehensiveness of the carbon budget. In a second step the model estimated the sink potential of the Thuringian forestry sector. The projected average biomass sink for the period of 2003-2043 of 0.6 t C ha-1 year-1 could be increased by 50% by broadening the perspective to the entire forestry sector, including substitution effects. A simulation of forest conservation on 20% of the forest area increased C fixation. However, even in the biomass C pool the expected C stock changes did not exceed the estimated uncertainty of 40%. A higher level of aggregation (i.e. the inclusion of soil and litter, product pool and substitution effects) decreases relative uncertainty but also diminishes differences between different management options. The analysis demonstrates that the choice of management mitigation options under an accounting scheme should include the impacts on forest products and of substitution effects. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Column plugging and excessive AOX breakthrough from the first carbon column to the second column are common analytical problems reported on wastewater samples from totally chlorine free (TCF) sulfite mills. Results using a pre-column affixed with a Cerafelt® plug in the lower end to capture solids showed that contributions of AOX from solids were minimal in process sewer samples evaluated in this study, suggesting that excluding solids from sample analyses would bias AOX results low by less than 5%. To address breakthrough, analyses were conducted using various dilutions and carbon amounts in the adsorption columns. Smaller sample volumes and higher carbon amounts did not reduce breakthrough sufficiently to meet the method-specified criterion of 25% or less for most samples tested. This suggests that the breakthrough problem may be due to competition for adsorption on the carbon from unknown constituents specific to sulfite mills and/or that the organic halides present are weakly adsorbed. Additional work was conducted to identify sources of AOX in a sulfite pulp and paper mill. Filtered water used in the bleach plant and purchased bleached kraft pulp were noted as primary sources. The study also suggested that AOX was not generated during sulfite pulp bleaching and may have been partially destroyed in that process. © 2008 by the National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc.","AOX; Cluster rule; Column breakthrough; Effluent; EPA method 1650; Mill sources; NPDES monitoring; Organic halide; Solids plugging; Sulfite mills","Cluster rule; Column breakthrough; NPDES monitoring; Organic halide; Solids plugging; Bleached pulp; Halide minerals; Paper and pulp mills; Sulfite process; Organic compounds; Bleaching; Halides; Organic Compounds; Sulfite Mills",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40749117228

Much is known about the processes that regulate the carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) of leaf, plant, and ecosystem carbon pools and of photosynthetic and respiratory carbon dioxide (CO 2) fluxes. In this review, systematic patterns and mechanisms underlying variation in δ13C of plant and ecosystem carbon pools and fluxes are described. We examine the hypothesis that the δ13C of leaf biomass can be used as a reference point for other carbon pools and fluxes, which differ from the leaf in δ13C in a systematic fashion. Plant organs are typically enriched in 13C relative to leaves, and most ecosystem pools and respiratory fluxes are enriched relative to sun leaves of dominant plants, with the notable exception of root respiration. Analysis of the chemical and isotopic composition of leaves and leaf respiration suggests that growth respiration has the potential to contribute substantially to the observed offset between the δ 13C values of ecosystem respiration and the bulk leaf. We discuss the implications of systematic variations in δ13C of ecosystem pools and CO2 fluxes for studies of carbon cycling within ecosystems, as well as for studies that use the δ13C of atmospheric CO2 to diagnose changes in the terrestrial biosphere over annual to millennial time scales. © The Authors (2008).","Carbon dioxide (CO2); Organic; Photosynthesis; Plant; Respiration; Soil","carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon isotope; isotopic composition; photosynthesis; phytomass; soil respiration; terrestrial ecosystem; autotrophy; cell respiration; ecosystem; metabolism; physiology; plant; review; Autotrophic Processes; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Isotopes; Cell Respiration; Ecosystem; Plants",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40349088797

An NMR-based perturbation mapping approach was used to more completely probe the dynamic response of the core mutation V54A in the protein eglin c by monitoring changes in picosecond to nanosecond aromatic side-chain dynamics and H/D exchange stabilities. Previous side-chain dynamics studies on this mutant were limited to methyl-bearing residues, most of which were found to rigidify on the picosecond to nanosecond time scale in the form of a contiguous ""network"". Here, high precision 13C relaxation data from 13 aromatic side chains were acquired by applying canonical relaxation experiments to a newly developed carbon labeling scheme [Teilum et al. (2006) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 128, 2506-2507]. The fitting of model-free parameters yielded S2 variability which is intermediate with respect to backbone and methyl-bearing side-chain variability and τe values that are approximately 1 ns. Inclusion of the aromatic dynamic response results in an expanded network of dynamically coupled residues, with some aromatics showing increases in flexibility, which partially offsets the rigidification in methyl side chains. Using amide hydrogen exchange, dynamic propagation on a slower time scale was probed in response to the V54A perturbation. Surprisingly, regional stabilization (slowed exchange) 10-12 Å from the site of mutation was observed despite a global destabilization of 1.5 kcal·mol-1. Furthermore, this unlikely pocket of stabilized residues colocalizes with increases in aromatic flexibility on the faster time scale. Because the converse is also true (destabilized residues colocalize with rigidification on the fast time scale), a plausible entropy-driven mechanism is discussed for relating colocalization of opposing dynamic trends on vastly different time scales. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Conformal mapping; Dynamic response; Exchange interactions; Mutagenesis; Nuclear magnetic resonance; Perturbation techniques; Phase stability; Proteins; Structural relaxation; Core mutation; Distal sites; Perturbation mapping; Side chain dynamics; Molecular dynamics; amide; aromatic compound; eglin C; methyl group; aromatic amino acid; carbon; eglin proteinase inhibitors; hydrogen; mutant protein; protein; accuracy; allosterism; article; carbon nuclear magnetic resonance; entropy; gene mutation; isotope labeling; molecular dynamics; molecular probe; molecular stability; monitoring; priority journal; proton transport; chemical structure; chemistry; genetics; kinetics; metabolism; movement (physiology); mutation; nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; protein conformation; thermodynamics; time; Amino Acids, Aromatic; Carbon Isotopes; Hydrogen; Kinetics; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Models, Molecular; Movement; Mutant Proteins; Mutation; Protein Conformation; Proteins; Thermodynamics; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42449088134

They are a rapidly growing subset of the population of the United States and are quite diverse in their racial ancestry, country of origin, area of residence, socioeconomic status, tobacco use, and access to health care. Current evidence suggests that the prevalence and morbidity of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) vary widely among Hispanic-American nations, with similar but limited findings among Hispanic subgroups in the United States. Potential reasons for such variation include differences in racial ancestry and genetic susceptibility, exposure to tobacco smoke and/or biomass smoke, access to health care, and disease management. Future studies of COPD in Hispanics should include large samples of subgroups that are well defined with regard to self-reported ethnicity, country of origin, area of residence, tobacco use, and socioeconomicstatus. Areas that need to be carefully examined include validation of COPD diagnoses for epidemiologic studies (e.g., by radiologic assessment), COPD in high-risk groups (e.g., Puerto Ricans), impact of biomass smoke (in rural areas) and air pollution (in urban areas) on COPD morbidity, effects of migration and acculturation on COPD prevalence and morbidity among Hispanic subgroups in the United States, development of reference values for spirometry, smoking cessation, and overcoming barriers to management.

River terraces provide important records of uplift, which is essential for their formation, and of landscape evolution. Their cyclic formation, however, almost invariably seems to have been a response to climatic fluctuation. Sequences in the European core area of IGCP 449, which has the longest and most extensive research history, have been used as templates for worldwide comparison. There is evidence for a global acceleration of uplift at the time of, and perhaps in response to, the Mid-Pleistocene Revolution, when climatic fluctuation switched to 100 kyr Milankovitch cycles. Terraces formed prior to this generally consist of wide aggradational sheets that probably each represent formation over several 41 kyr cycles. Subsequently, river valleys became more steeply entrenched and terraces formed in response to the stronger 100 kyr climatic forcing, in many cases at approximately one per cycle. This paper uses the new data resource to explore differences between records in different climate zones, between sequences with variable numbers of Middle-Late Pleistocene terraces and between systems in which the all-important incision event has occurred in different parts of climatic cycles.

A defined deletion in the cg1547 gene, now designated uriR (uridine utilization regulator), resulted in the mutant strain C. glutamicum KB1547. Comparison of gene expression levels in C. glutamicum KB1547 and the wild-type strain revealed enhanced expression of the uriR operon genes cg1546 (ribokinase), cg1545 (uridine transporter) and cg1543 (uridine-preferring nucleoside hydrolase). Gene expression of the uriR operon was stimulated by the presence of either uridine or ribose. Growth assays with C. glutamicum mutants showed that functional Cg1543 and Cg1545 proteins are essential for the utilization of uridine as the sole carbon source. Transcriptional regulation of the uriR operon is mediated by a 29 bp palindromic sequence composed of two catabolite-responsive element (cre)-like sequences and located in between the mapped -10 promoter region and the start codon of uriR. A similar cre sequence was detected in the upstream region of rbsK2 (cg2554), coding for a second ribolkinase in C. glutamicum ATCC 13032. DNA band-shift assays with a streptavidin-tagged UriR protein and labelled oligonucleotides including the cre-like sequences of uriR and rbsK2 demonstrated the specific binding of the purified regulator in vitro. Whole-genome DNA microarray hybridizations comparing the gene expression in C. glutamicurn KB1547 with that of the wild-type strain revealed that UriR is a pathway-specific repressor of genes involved in uridine utilization in C. glutamicum. © 2008 SGM.",,"carbon; catabolite control protein A; complementary DNA; nucleosidase; oligonucleotide; protein GalR; protein kinase; protein Lacl; protein UriR; regulator protein; ribose; streptavidin; transcription factor; uridine; bacterial DNA; bacterial protein; carrier protein; glycosidase; phosphotransferase; repressor protein; ribokinase; uridine; article; bacterial growth; bacterial strain; carbon source; controlled study; Corynebacterium glutamicum; deletion mutant; DNA binding; DNA flanking region; DNA microarray; gene deletion; gene expression; gene mapping; gene sequence; in vitro study; nonhuman; operon; priority journal; promoter region; protein family; protein function; protein localization; repressor gene; start codon; transcription regulation; wild type; binding site; biosynthesis; comparative study; Corynebacterium glutamicum; gel mobility shift assay; gene expression profiling; gene order; genetics; growth, development and aging; metabolism; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; protein binding; Corynebacterium glutamicum ATCC 13032; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Binding Sites; Corynebacterium glutamicum; DNA, Bacterial; Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay; Gene Expression Profiling; Gene Order; Membrane Transport Proteins; Molecular Sequence Data; N-Glycosyl Hydrolases; Operon; Phosphotransferases (Alcohol Group Acceptor); Promoter Regions (Genetics); Protein Binding; Repressor Proteins; Uridine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349107696

To explore the pre-birth views of primiparous women in relation to childbirth and the role of the midwife intrapartum. Objectives. To contribute to the debate on women's childbirth expectations within the current climate of escalating intervention rates and to explore how women view the role of the midwife. Method. A qualitative framework encompassing an explorative descriptive design. Semi-structured interviews with eight 'low-risk' primiparous women between 34 to 41 weeks' gestation were analysed using Attride-Stirling's (2001) systematic method for thematic'analysis. Results. Two global themes emerged from the data - maintaining internal control and external control factors. These were supported by six organising themes: facilitating an intervention-free birth, going with the flow, faith in the system, fear of the unknown, role of support partner and role of the midwife. The findings suggest that women expect and hope for a birth devoid of intervention and place considerable faith in the hospital's ability to provide appropriate and safe care. While women viewed the midwife as a specialist, their understanding of the midwives' role intrapartum was limited. The importance of support and education for the birthing partner was also highlighted. Implications. Midwives need to ensure they do not foster a state of dependence and that women are able to maintain choice and integrity throughout the birth experience. Women may need information regarding the role and expertise of the midwife intrapartum. © 2008 The Royal College of Midwives.","Attride-stirling approach to data analysis; Intrapartum expectations; Midwifery; Pre-birth expectations; Role of midwife; Women's views",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67651114102

This region is centered around the root, and is best defined by the biotic response to the influence of the root. Thus, the spatial limits of the rhizosphere are determined by the soil biotic community under the direct or indirect influence of plant roots. The composition and dynamics of this biotic community is dependent on plant species, root architecture, plant carbon allocation, soil physical and chemical properties, microbial population diversity, among a host of other factors. Though root biology and ecology are more challenging than aboveground studies, the biological and ecological importance of the root system and surrounding rhizosphere has prompted many detailed studies of root biology and rhizosphere ecology.

The dynamics of the system are studied using a renormalized master equation, both with multipolar and minimal-coupling interaction schemes. We show that both models lead to the same result and, in contrast to nonrenormalized models, predict that the relative orientation of the (coaligned) dipoles is unimportant in the Dicke limit. Our master equation is of relevance to any system of dipole-coupled two-level atoms, and gives bounds on the strength of the dipole-dipole interaction for closely spaced atoms. Exact calculations for small atom systems in the near-Dicke limit show the increased emission times resulting from the evolution generated by the strong dipole-dipole interaction. However, for large numbers of atoms in the near-Dicke limit, it is shown that as the number of atoms increases, the effect of the dipole-dipole interaction on collective emission is reduced. © 2008 The American Physical Society.",,"Magnetic moments; Mathematical models; Resonance; Wavelength; Minimal-coupling interaction; Subradiant emission; Electromagnetic wave emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549110208

It has been recognized that many, if not all, problems of environmental degradation are transboundary in nature and therefore need an international solution. National policy measures essentially cannot cope with international environmental problems because the source of pollution or the impact of pollution may not be within a particular state's jurisdiction. Traditionally, international environmental problems have been addressed at international environmental conferences where treaties are designed that commit the signatories to controlling the problem in question. Since the 1970s the number of international environmental agreements (IEAs) has risen to reach record numbers. There is a loose assumption that this is a good thing and that this rise has resulted in a commensurable improvement in environmental protection. But is this actually the case? In fact, many would argue that there is little positive correlation at all. What are the connections between environmental diplomacy and environmental protection and how can environmental protection be achieved? IEAs are international legal instruments adopted by a large number of states and intergovernmental organizations with the primary purpose of preventing, and managing, negative human impacts on natural resources. IEAs can take the form of a single instrument or a series of interlinked documents such as conventions, followed by protocols and amendments. For example, The Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol are part of the same framework. IEAs cover a broad range of policy areas, from biodiversity to regulating humanmade greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere, and the control of chemicals and hazardous wastes. The implementation of IEAs is a complex process, involving coercion of a wide range of actors into accepting environmental goals and subsequently implementing the necessary behavioural changes. To these ends, IEAs adopt a series of constitutional measures: a Conference of Parties (COP) to act as a decision-making body on behalf of the policy; a secretariat to support the COP and administer the policy, and various other executive and subsidiary bodies to advise and report on the policy on a non-mandatory basis. Institutional arrangements such as international (or multilateral as they are also called) environmental agreements reflect negotiated compromises at the policy level and are the sum total of what is politically feasible to achieve. However, these compromises also tell a story about priorities in policy-making which reflect the interests of the most powerful actors in this policy process or indeed other overlapping policy processes. These priorities can be manifested in economic terms, in social terms, in agenda-setting in general and in evaluations or definitions of the environmental problem in question. As the case studies presented in this chapter will show, there is very often a lack of connection between the political compromises that shape an international agreement on the environment and the ecological demands of a particular environmental problem. There is also often a level of abstraction to policy remedies that do not account for social inequalities between states but also between social groups in states and how they are affected by an environmental problem and how the economic and social cost of a solution affects them. It is felt by many analysts and activists of global environmental politics that the state-centric form of agreement-making marginalizes the environment and many of the world's citizens. They see the actors in global environmental politics as a triangular set of relations rather than as an issue of the state that regulates everything with other actors subordinate to the state. So a triangular vision would see the state, economic actors and civil society actors all vying to influence environmental outcomes. It cannot be denied that since the 1980s non-state actors have experienced a significant rise in influence on the international scene. States are still the only sovereign actors (the ones with the legal and military power to make decisions) but nonstate actors have been integrated into all international decision-making processes and perform important stakeholder functions. Non-state actors may not be able to sign legal documents but they perform agenda-setting tasks, influence meetings, provide information, act as a voice of caution or reason, and also bring in new dimensions to any discussion. We now have an international and global field of politics in which there are international legal agreements on the environment between states, legal agreements signed by states and other actors (legally binding for the states) and agreements between non-state actors that are seen as equally influential as state-led arrangements (not legally binding, although very much in the spotlight). Non-state actors are defined simply as actors not representing governments and can range from environmental non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to community advocacy groups, scientific think tanks and multinational corporations (MNCs). Since the 1970s, environmental policy has seen a dramatic intensification of non-state actor involvement and subsequently environmental policy-making and international regime building can no longer be described as a singularly government/state centric activity (it is currently estimated that 40,000 NGOs are operating in international regime building). Environmental policy-making represents a complex and ambiguous policy process whereby both state and non-state actors shape the content and implementation of IEAs. Additionally, the process of economic and media globalization has further blurred the line between actors. The assumption is that with these trends we as a global society have the means to move away from abstract agreements driven by economic rationality and political compromise and hampered by the constraints of lengthy lead times to a more democratic form of decision-making that can focus more on the most pressing challenges of the twenty-first century. However, these trends do not resolve the fundamental problem of growing inequality among various social groups on this planet, nor do they address the debate between technological progress and consumption. The question remains whether the existing frameworks for dealing with environmental problems are adequate to rise to this seemingly insurmountable challenge. © 2000, 2008 Editorial selection and matter, Trevor C.

Combustion temperatures were determined by two methods: by measuring the unburned oxygen in the exhaust and by calculating the temperature using the fuel and airflows. These temperatures were correlated to ratios composed of the integrated intensity of the long wavelength region of the OH band between 310 to 340 nm (ratio's numerator) and that between 305 and 310 nm (ratio's denominator). Average local combustor flame temperatures at the end of the combustion zone may then be determined by tracking these ratios during combustor operation. The sensitivity of these ratios yields a 0.8% change in the ratios every 20°F with a precision of ±30°F or ±1% at 3000°F with 95% confidence bounds demonstrating the feasibility of this technique for use as a potential control parameter for gas turbine combustors burning natural gas and air mixtures. This method is well suited for the low equivalence ratios (< 1) required to reduce NOx and CO emissions. Other methods using peak ratios of different emission bands exhibit nonlinearity, lower sensitivity and greater uncertainty. © 2008 IEEE.","Chemiluminescence; Combustion; Emission; Flame temperature; UV","Chemiluminescence; Combustion; Gas turbines; Natural gas; Parameter estimation; Ultraviolet radiation; Airflows; Combustor operation; Flame temperature; Natural gas flames; Temperature distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38749145212

From below, the plate was heated by non-reacting, turbulent air jets (Re = 5,000) and by a laminar flame (λ = 0.7, Re = 350), respectively. For well-defined boundary conditions, the plate was cooled by a turbulent cold jet from above in both cases. Wall temperature as well as gas temperature distributions within and outside of the thermal boundary layer of the hot side of the system were determined. The radial surface temperature profile of the plate was measured by coating it with thermographic phosphors (TP), materials whose phosphorescence decay time is dependent on their temperature. The TP was excited electronically by a frequency-tripled Nd:YAG laser (355 nm). The temporal decay of the phosphorescence intensity was measured pointwise by a photomultiplier tube. In this case, the 659 nm emission line of Mg4FGeO6:Mn was monitored. Non-intrusive point measurements of the gas temperature close to the surface were performed by rovibrational coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS) of diatomic nitrogen. Beams from a seeded, frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser (532 nm) and from a modeless broadband dye laser (607 nm) were phase-matched into a surface-parallel, planar-boxcars configuration. The temperature data could be collected as close as 300 μm to the surface. Thermographic phosphors as well as CARS proved to be consistent for wall temperature and boundary layer measurements in all test cases.

The newest treatment systems can compensate for tumor target motion as well as shape dose distributions to conform precisely to delineated target volumes. These sophisticated technologies now drive the development of imaging modalities able to generate equally high-resolution and lesion-specific roadmaps that are the foundation of these highly accurate radiation plans. Positron emission tomography/computed tomography (PET/CT) is currently becoming a routine imaging tool for radiation oncology because of its combined benefits of positron imaging and high-resolution anatomic display. The improved staging and lesion delineation provided by PET, combined with the 3D anatomic display provided by CT, now allows better treatment stratification and more precise targeting. Additionally, respiratory-gated 4D CT and 4D PET/CT have been used in the simulation process for respiratory-gated radiation therapy. Successful integration of PET/CT into the radiation therapy planning process requires an understanding of how therapy plans are derived and the process by which the patient receives therapy, because these dictate the method of image acquisition. The radiation oncologists, too, must understand the technology of positron imaging to adapt these functional images based on intensities rather than pixels to their targeting process. Modifications to the PET/CT scanner and room are necessary to image the patient in the reproducible position required for treatment planning. Although the impact of these efforts on patient outcome has yet to be determined, the benefit of better treatment choice, due to improved staging, and more precise targeting with less normal tissue exposure resulting in improved quality of life will likely promote PET/CT to the gold-standard for targeted therapies. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This gregarious species feeds on suspended detritus and phytoplankton. Given the large area dominated by reefs, suspension feeding by this species might reduce the lagoon phytoplankton concentration and even hinder local eutrophication. To evaluate this hypothesis in situ replicated mesocosm experiments were performed in spring 2005 and, summer and winter 2006. Mesocosms enclosing reefs and without reefs were installed and grazing intensity was measured as the difference in chlorophyll a concentration and turbidity between the reef-treatment and the treatment without reefs. Reefs of F. enigmaticus decreased the mean chlorophyll a concentration, more during summer (56% decrease) than spring (25% decrease) and winter (19% decrease). Reefs also decreased water turbidity during summer (54% decrease) and spring (23% decrease). While previous studies indicate that the physical structure of these reefs alters water flow increasing water turbidity, our evidences show that their suspension-feeding activity can counteract this effect. Water turbidity was positively correlated with chlorophyll a concentration, which suggests that phytoplankton grazing by F. enigmaticus decreased light attenuation through the water column, with a potential for enhancement of benthic primary productivity. Therefore, our results suggest that grazing by this polychaete affects overall estuarine primary production as well as the relative importance of planktonic and benthic carbon sources to higher trophic levels. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluating the long-term effects of harvesting and planting strategies is important especially as the climate changes. In this study, we evaluated the effects of the projected climate warming on potential changes in species' coverage (percent cover), area harvested (percentage of the study area) and species harvested, using the LANDIS model. Our evaluation was based on the harvest and planting plans specified in Natural Forest Protection Project (NFPP). Our simulated results show that the coverage of southern species such as Korean pine (Pinus koraiensis) and ribbed birch (Betula costata) increases, whereas the coverage of northern species like larch (Larix gmelinii), Kingan fir (Abies nephrolepis), spruces (Picea koraiensis and P. jezoensis) and Dahur birch (Betula davurica) decreases under the warming climate in the region. The species harvested primarily consist of the southern species, especially deciduous species under the warming climate. The warming climate leads to 11.2% increase in area harvested compared to that under the current climate, when planting is not simulated. When planting is simulated, tradeoffs between planting and area harvested are complex. The area harvested only increases in places where moderate planting is implemented, and decreases in places with both low (≤5% area planted) and high (≥30%) planting percentage. This is because when the planting percentage is low, the rate of increase of harvestable species due to planting is lower than the rate of decrease of warming-declining species. When the planting percentage is high, the rate of increase of planted species is higher than the rate of colonization of warming-adapted deciduous species, and the planted species delay the establishment of the warming-adaptable species that have short harvest rotations (due to lower harvestable ages). Our results suggest that the management strategy with planting area of 20% is the best among all the scenarios simulated. Under this warming climate, moderate planting area (e.g. 20%) increases the area harvested to about 43%, which is still less than that (58%) designated in the NFPP. These results have important implications for forest managers designing sustainable forest harvest and reforestation strategies for the landscape under the warming climate. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Although sulfate-reducing organisms dominate anaerobic carbon consumption in marine microbial mats, methanogens persist and their activity varies vertically and temporally in the mat system. In the Sippewissett mats, potential methane production for all mat layers was higher in the spring (17.2 ± 4.5 nmol CH4 cm-2 day-1) than in the fall (3.0 ± 1.1 nmol CH4 cm-2 day-1) and maximal rates were consistently observed in proximity to the chemocline (5-10 mm depth). The methane flux from the mat surface did not vary appreciably over time due to the ability of methanotrophic activity to limit net methane production. Evidence indicates that both aerobic and anaerobic oxidation of methane occurs in this system. The importance of H2 as a substrate for methanogenesis appeared to be the greatest at the mat surface (0-10 mm), and the proportion of methylotrophic methanogens generally increased with depth. These results suggest that both non-equilibrium H2 dynamics and the use of non-competitive substrates permit coexistence of methanogens and sulfate-reducing organisms in the mat system. © 2008 The Authors.",,"hydrogen; methane; sea water; sulfate; article; bacterium; biology; metabolism; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; United States; Bacteria; Hydrogen; Marine Biology; Massachusetts; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction; Seawater; Sulfates; Water Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40949092360

Planar 123I-MIBG scans revealed decreased heart-to-mediastinum ratios at early (20 minutes) and delayed (4 hours) images (2.1 ± 0.1 and 1.9 ± 0.1, respectively). The cardiac washout rate of 123I-MIBG on the late images was increased to 34% ± 3%. The 123I-MIBG uptake on SPECT scans was obviously reduced in the akinetic LV apex (defect score, 3.30 ± 0.34), whereas 99mTc-MIBI SPECT indicated normal or only mildly reduced perfusion within this region (defect score, 0.89 ± 0.35). Conclusions: Our study indicates a functional alteration in presynaptic sympathetic neurotransmission in patients with TLVAB, and suggests a pathophysiologic explanation of the impairment of LV function. © 2008 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.","123I-MIBG; 99mTC-MIBI; adregenic innervation; Apical ballooning; cardiomyopathy; SPECT; Tako-Tsubo","(3 iodobenzyl)guanidine i 123; methoxy isobutyl isonitrile technetium tc 99m; acute coronary syndrome; adrenergic nerve; adrenergic transmission; aged; angiocardiography; article; cardiomyopathy; clinical article; controlled study; female; heart innervation; heart left ventricle; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; heart left ventricle function; heart perfusion; human; male; pathogenesis; pathophysiology; patient selection; presynaptic nerve; priority journal; single photon emission computer tomography; sympathetic innervation; sympathetic tone; takotsubo cardiomyopathy; Aged; Autonomic Nervous System Diseases; Female; Heart; Heart Ventricles; Humans; Male; Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38649100372

Urban life in Australian cities has been physically structured around the private motor vehicle, and transport policies have historically focused on the public funding of large-scale public roadways. There is no better example of this approach to transport planning than in Southeast Queensland, where government departments associated with responsibilities for road infrastructure have traditionally wielded enormous power, and have repeatedly attempted to impose large-scale technological solutions for transport problems without regard for their wider impacts on urban life. Despite an emerging awareness of the need to reduce carbon emissions by establishing alternative models of urban mobility, local authorities in Brisbane have recently followed in this wellestablished tradition by embarking on an ambitious expansion of river crossings and underground road tunnels as a way to increase the capacity of private vehicular flows through the inner city. This article is an exploration of the philosophical framework 'driving' these political decisions and their inevitable imposition of new spatio-temporal laws on Brisbane's inhabitants. Drawing on Henri Lefebvre's account of the relationship between the production of space and social rhythms, it is argued that these transport planning decisions and the way they govern mobility will reproduce the destructive effects of abstraction on both space and the rhythms of the city. © 2015, Routledge.

Location: Lowland rain forests in the western Amazon. Methods: Floristic data on 91 woody plant genera, from 39 0.1-ha plots across the western Amazon, and precipitation data from a 0.5° global data set were used to test for correlations between plant relative abundance (defined as percentage number of stems ≥ 2.5 cm diameter at breast height for each woody plant genus per plot) and derived dry-season variables. Moisture preference was then assessed in terms of pioneer and shade-tolerant life-history strategy. Results: There were significant associations between the distribution of plant relative abundances and seasonal precipitation variables in 34% of genera analysed. Significant differences were identified in size-class distribution between dry affiliates and generalists. Dry affiliates were not dominant in any size class in any plot type, whereas climate generalists dominated most of the size classes in the dry plots and the mid-range size classes in the wet plots. Dry-affiliate genera were a minority, even in dry forests. Wet-affiliate genera were correlated with shade tolerance, whereas genera with no rainfall affiliation were often pioneers. Main conclusions: The results suggest that moisture variable seasonality influences community composition in a manner that can be related to the life-history trade-off between shade tolerance and pioneer ranking. One possible reason for higher diversity in wetter forests is that high rainfall amplifies the niche space available to shade-tolerant plants. Determining which plant groups are constrained by which environmental variables can contribute to our understanding of how forest composition may be changing now, and how it may change under future climate: if shade-tolerant trees are also drought-intolerant, community structure in wet forests may be more vulnerable to future increases in moisture stress. © 2008 The Authors.","Amazon forest; Community composition; Dry-season intensity; Precipitation gradient; Relative abundance; Shade tolerance","climate; community composition; community structure; drought stress; dry season; floristics; range size; relative abundance; shade tolerance; size distribution; species diversity; woody plant; Amazonia; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42349084356

As a result, monitoring networks that track PM levels have been established across the United States. Some of the older monitors measure PM less than 10 μm in diameter (PM10), while the newer monitors track PM levels less than 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5); it is now believed that this fine component of PM is more likely to be related to the negative health effects associated with PM. We propose a bivariate dynamic process convolution model for PM 2.5 and PM10 concentrations. Our aim is to extract information about PM2.5 from PM10 monitor readings using a latent variable approach and to provide better space-time interpolations of PM 2.5 concentrations compared to interpolations made using only PM 2.5 monitoring information.

Thawing of these mounds creates thermokarst lakes, which are particularly abundant in Nunavik, east of the Hudson Bay area. The inception of the permafrost in mounds and their growth are regulated by climate conditions, by local Quaternary geology and by environmental factors such as topography, vegetation, snow cover and surface humidity. Variable sizes and morphology of the permafrost mounds can be attributed to local factors that affect the ice segregation process, particularly the supply of water needed for ice-lens growth and grain-size composition of the soil into which aggradation takes place. Computer image analysis of CT scans on high quality cores obtained from permafrost mounds and plateaus of various shapes reveal that the ice layer sequences and permafrost internal structure vary with landform types. A relationship therefore exists between different morphological type within a family of landforms and their microscale internal structure.

Advantageous spacecraft orbits during the first 120 days of 2007 allowed ENA observations to be mapped to the equatorial plane of the planet and surveyed as a statistical ensemble in a Sun-synchronous coordinate system. When projected onto the equatorial plane, emissions from both energetic hydrogen atoms (20-50 keV) and energetic oxygen atoms (64-144 keV) form toroidal distributions nearly concentric with the planet. The hydrogen torus is continuous in local time, but the oxygen torus has a gap from dawn to noon. When fitted to circles, the H torus has a mean radius of 11.0 ±0.5 Rs, while the O torus has a mean radius of 7.9 ±0.8 RS(1 RS= 60268 km). Both tori display peaks at just before midnight at local times of 23.6 h (H) and 21.8 h (O). These maxima seem to be regular features over the 120-day interval surveyed, suggesting the hot spot may be caused by injection of particles from Saturn's magnetotail, as would be the case during substorms. However, the persistence of the ENA emissions suggests they are continuously driven by processes internal to Saturn's magnetosphere. When mapped along magnetic field lines to Saturn's ionosphere, both H and O emissions appear equatorward of the aurora and are distinct from it.

It defines a coherent and updated set of input parameters (emission factors, mileage and fleet composition) for traffic emission estimation between 1998 and 2015. 1998-2004 emissions are assessed basing on historical data, while 2005-2015 rely on different hypothesis about mobility development and vehicular turnover rate. The work shows that road traffic emissions of PM10 and PM10 precursors are expected to decrease in the period 2005-2015, with a reduction greater than 70% in scenarios with a fast vehicle turnover and a decrease in fuel usage. Increase in fuel consumption could substantially lower the emission reduction expected, off-setting a substantial part of the new technology benefits. The introduction of DPF (diesel particulate filter) vehicles will determine a reduction of PM10 exhaust, however this could potentially be stalled by the increase in diesel usage in the vehicle fleet and an increase in mileage driven, as the latter causes a rise in the contribution of PM10 from abrasion. Concerning the total atmospheric emissions in Lombardy, SO2 (- 6%) and NH3 (&lt; - 2%) emission will remain constant, while PM10, VOC and NOx emission will decrease, respectively by 2-30%, 6-15% and 2-32% in the period 2001-2015. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Data on whether a bill was introduced in the state legislature and whether a law was enacted to address childhood obesity were linked to a rich set of independent variables concerning state political and socioeconomic characteristics that were drawn from a variety of sources. The association between state legislative action and state political and socioeconomic characteristics was measured using probit regression.Results:From 2003 to 2005 there was an increasing trend toward the introduction of bills and enactment of laws to address childhood obesity. State legislative action on childhood obesity was more likely in states with a greater gap between adults' actual and desired weight, a higher percentage of college-educated adults, a higher percentage of African-American residents, a Democratic governor, or a legislature not controlled by Republicans.Discussion: The socioeconomic conditions of the state and its political climate strongly predict legislative action to address childhood obesity. The finding that Democratic governors and state legislatures not controlled by Republicans are associated with greater policy action against obesity suggests that the 2006 election may result in additional action against obesity in certain states.

In countries like Italy, with an high potential in terms of wind power generation, an efficient energy planning based on renewables is a very complex task. It encompasses many aspects: the resource availability assessment, the compliance with environmental and legislative constraints and last, but not least, the technical aspects linked to the safe integration to the grid of the intermittent power generated by the wind farms. This paper is the first part of a study addressing the first of the aforementioned issues. The wind measurements recorded in several stations of Sicily (Italy) were used for the spatial modelling of the wind fields over the region. A statistical analysis of the wind data has allowed the estimation of the parameters of the wind probability distribution function, that is a Weibull, as predicted by theory. In the last sections of the paper the results of some traditional deterministic and geostatistical interpolation techniques are shown. In the companion paper the maps of the estimated wind fields have been obtained by using the results of the statistical investigation accomplished here and coupling neural and geostatistical techniques. For a comprehensive evaluation of the forecasting accuracy of this neural kriging approach, those maps have to be compared with the maps showed in this paper. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Box 236, Reading RG6 6AT, United Kingdom","Many modelling studies examine the impacts of climate change on crop yield, but few explore either the underlying bio-physical processes, or the uncertainty inherent in the parameterisation of crop growth and development. We used a perturbed-parameter crop modelling method together with a regional climate model (PRECIS) driven by the 2071-2100 SRES A2 emissions scenario in order to examine processes and uncertainties in yield simulation. Crop simulations used the groundnut (i.e. peanut; Arachis hypogaea L.) version of the General Large-Area Model for annual crops (GLAM). Two sets of GLAM simulations were carried out: control simulations and fixed-duration simulations, where the impact of mean temperature on crop development rate was removed. Model results were compared to sensitivity tests using two other crop models of differing levels of complexity: CROPGRO, and the groundnut model of Hammer et al. [Hammer, G.L., Sinclair, T.R., Boote, K.J., Wright, G.C., Meinke, H., and Bell, M.J., 1995, A peanut simulation model: I. Model development and testing. Agron. J. 87, 1085-1093]. GLAM simulations were particularly sensitive to two processes. First, elevated vapour pressure deficit (VPD) consistently reduced yield. The same result was seen in some simulations using both other crop models. Second, GLAM crop duration was longer, and yield greater, when the optimal temperature for the rate of development was exceeded. Yield increases were also seen in one other crop model. Overall, the models differed in their response to super-optimal temperatures, and that difference increased with mean temperature; percentage changes in yield between current and future climates were as diverse as - 50% and over + 30% for the same input data. The first process has been observed in many crop experiments, whilst the second has not. Thus, we conclude that there is a need for: (i) more process-based modelling studies of the impact of VPD on assimilation, and (ii) more experimental studies at super-optimal temperatures. Using the GLAM results, central values and uncertainty ranges were projected for mean 2071-2100 crop yields in India. In the fixed-duration simulations, ensemble mean yields mostly rose by 10-30%. The full ensemble range was greater than this mean change (20-60% over most of India). In the control simulations, yield stimulation by elevated CO2 was more than offset by other processes - principally accelerated crop development rates at elevated, but sub-optimal, mean temperatures. Hence, the quantification of uncertainty can facilitate relatively robust indications of the likely sign of crop yield changes in future climates. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Detailed information on present NO2 levels as well as predictions of NO2 concentrations corresponding to reduced NOx levels in urban areas are very useful to decision and policy makers in order to protect the public health. In the present paper, monitoring stations of the Athens network are initially classified into two main groups, traffic affected and urban background, using effectively a criterion based on the ratio of annual mean NO:NO2 concentrations. Two empirical methodologies are then considered and compared for assessing the effect of different NOx levels on the attainment of the annual NO2 air quality standard at urban-background locations in the Athens area. An interesting finding is that these two methodologies, one more general and one both year and site dependent, give similar results for the specific study area and can be applied alternatively based on the length of available concentration time series. The results show that in order to meet the EU annual mean NO2 objective at all the urban-background locations of the Athens area, annual NOx concentrations should be reduced to approximately 60 μg m-3, requiring NOx emission reductions of up to 30%. An analysis of the health implications of the currently observed NO2 levels is conducted, based on a dose-response relationship, and is coupled with available health-related data for the Athens area. This analysis suggests that if NO2 concentrations were reduced to the levels of the annual EU air quality standard, then a decrease of hospital admissions of up to 2.6% would be observed, depending on the levels of NO2 measured at different monitoring sites of the Athens conurbation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Strains with one or two AKR genes disrupted have apparently normal phenotypes, but disruption of at least three AKR genes results in a heat shock phenotype and slow growth in inositol-deficient culture medium (Ino-). The present study was carried out to identify metabolic or signaling defects that may underlie phenotypes that emerge in AKR deficient strains. Here we demonstrate that pretreatment of a pentuple AKR null mutant with the anti-oxidative agent N-acetyl-cysteine rescues the heat shock phenotype. This indicates that AKR gene disruption may be associated with defects in oxidative stress response. We observed additional markers of oxidative stress in AKR-deficient strains, including reduced glutathione levels, constitutive nuclear localization of the oxidation-sensitive transcription factor Yap1 and upregulation of a set of Yap1 target genes whose function as a group is primarily involved in response to oxidative stress and redox balance. Genetic analysis of the Ino- phenotype of the null mutants showed that defects in transcriptional regulation of the INO1, which encodes for inositol-1-phosphate synthase, can be rescued through ectopic expression of a functional INO1. Taken together, these results suggest potential roles for AKRs in oxidative defense and transcriptional regulation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The field method often applied to date has compared the δ13C of emitted to anaerobic zone CH 4. Recent laboratory mass balance studies have indicated that this approach tends to underestimate CH4 oxidation. Therefore, we examined the CH4-δ13C at various soil depths in field settings and compared these values to emitted CH4. At 5-10 cm depth, we observed the most enrichment in CH4-δ13C (-46.0 to -32.1‰). Emitted CH4-δ13C was more negative, ranging from -56.5 to -43.0 ‰. The decrease in CH 4-δ13C values from the shallow subsurface to the surface is the result of processes that result in selective emission of 12CH4 and selective retention of 13CH 4 within the soil. Seasonal percent oxidation was calculated at seven sites representing four cover materials. Probe samples averaged greater (21 ± 2%, p &lt; 0.001, n = 7) oxidation than emitted CH4 data. We argue that calculations of fraction oxidized based on soil derived CH 4 should yield upper limit values. When considered with emitted CH4 values, this combined approach will more realistically bracket the actual oxidation value. Following this guideline, we found the percent oxidation to be 23 ± 3% and 38 ± 16% for four soil and three compost covers, respectively. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon isotopes; Methane oxidation; Anaerobic digestion; Computation theory; Isotopes; Land fill; Oxidation; Soils; Methane; carbon 13; delta carbon 13; methane; unclassified drug; Anaerobic digestion; Computation theory; Isotopes; Land fill; Methane; Oxidation; Soils; carbon isotope; compost; field survey; landfill; mass balance; methane; methanotrophy; oxidation; stable isotope; article; calculation; compost; field emission; field study; landfill; materials; mathematical analysis; oxidation; quantitative assay; soil analysis; United States; Carbon Isotopes; Methane; Oxidation-Reduction; Refuse Disposal; Seasons; Soil; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949190912

Tablets were compared for similar total porosity. The end-use property study highlighted that the presence of 2% of sodium dodecyl sulphate was not favorable to the tablet mechanical characteristics, inducing a lower ""bonding ability"". The linear relationship between the disintegration and dissolution times showed that the disintegration time was relevant to express the behavior of the tablets in water. The disintegration data showed two zones: when porosity was higher than 20%, the disintegration time was always lower than 2 min g-1 and similar for both formulas; for lower porosities, the disintegration time increased and was higher in the presence of the surfactant. In this second case, the released CO2 due to the reaction between adipic acid and sodium bicarbonate in water was slowed down in the presence of the surfactant, confirming the disintegration data. However, this negative effect of SDS on the disintegration time could not be linked to a difference of pore size distribution between the two formulas. So, despite the creation of weak interparticle bonds with the other compounds of the formula, the presence of SDS increased the disintegration by limiting the water uptake, independently of the porous texture. Moreover, no preferential localization of the surfactant at the surface of the tablet might be involved to explain the effect of SDS on the tablet accessibility by water. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Detergent; Disintegration; Porosity; Surfactant; Tablet; Tensile strength","Chlorine; Pore size; Porous materials; Sodium compounds; Textures; Water; Bonding ability; Disintegration time; Interparticle bonds; Porous texture; Surface active agents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42449143045

If New Zealand is to continue to position itself as a truly sustainable nation, it will need to take radical and effective steps to reduce its transport-related carbon dioxide emissions. Even if New Zealand were not to take early action, it is likely that it would come under strong international pressure to stay in step with progressive countries. The government has recently committed, in principle, to cutting domestic transport related emissions by 50 percent by 2040, but it is not yet clear that the measures the government has proposed will get New Zealand to this target. This paper examines the policy opportunities provided by urban form and transport, arguing that these issues have been little explored to date in New Zealand in terms of their potential to reduce carbon emissions, and provide co-benefits such as health gains and cost savings. Ensuring that urban development and transport policies are highly innovative and integrated will be critical to the sustainability transition that New Zealand is now beginning to make, including the transition to low-carbon transport.","Emissions; Greenhouse gases; Policy; Transport; Urban form",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57249105503

Conical flames were anchored on a disk-shaped bluff body that was attached to a central rod in the burner nozzle. A combustible propane-air mixture flowed through a converging axisymmetric nozzle with a concentric insert, allowing radial mixture variation by tailoring the composition in the inner and outer parts of the nozzle. The radial mixture profiles were characterized near the location of the flame holder by laser Rayleigh light scattering. Additionally, a loudspeaker at the nozzle base allowed introduction of periodic velocity oscillations with an amplitude of 9% of the mean flow velocity up to a frequency of 350 Hz. The flame blowoff equivalence ratio was experimentally determined by continuously lowering the fuel flow rates and determining the flame detachment point from the flame holder. Flame detachment was detected by a rapid reduction of CH* emission from the flame base imaged by a photomultiplier detector. It was found that the flame blowoff is preceded by progressive narrowing of the flame cone for the case of higher inner jet equivalence ratios. In this case, the fuel-lean outer flow cannot sustain combustion, and clearly this is not a good way of operating a combustor. Nevertheless, the overall blowoff equivalence ratio is reduced by inner stream fuel enrichment. A possible explanation for this behavior is given based on the radial extent of the variable-equivalence-ratio mixture burning near the flame stabilization region. Fuel enrichment in the outer flow was found to have no effect on blowoff as compared to the case of uniform mixture. The results were similar for the whole range of mean flow velocities and upstream excitation frequencies. © 2008 The Combustion Institute.","Bluff-body stabilization; Flow oscillation; Mixture gradients; Premixed flames","Light scattering; Nozzles; Photomultipliers; Velocity measurement; Bluff-body stabilization; Flow oscillation; Mixture gradients; Premixed flames; Flame research; fuel; Flame research; Light scattering; Nozzles; Photomultipliers; Velocity measurement; article; combustion; flow rate; light scattering; oscillation; priority journal; velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43549084563

Two independent methods to extract the gross primary productivity (GPP) from atmospheric CO2 concentration measurements were explored and compared in this study. The methods are (1) planetary boundary layer (PBL) carbon budget analysis that allows the estimation of regional GPP at daily time steps from hourly CO2 concentration measurements and (2) spatially explicit hourly carbon cycle modeling based on remote sensing and then integrating the daily flux field with a concentration footprint function depending on wind and stability. These methods have been applied to a 28-m tower at an old black spruce site near Candle Lake (∼ 100 km NE of Prince Albert: 53.98717∞*N, 105.11779°W). The estimates of daily GPP by these two approaches agreed well for 2003 (slope = 0.99; r2 = 0.89). In order to test these methods of inferring the regional GPP from mixing ratio measurements, we also compared the estimates of regional GPP with estimates made using eddy covariance (EC) flux measurements, although their respective source areas are different. They had similar seasonal patterns, but the regional estimates were consistently smaller than the local EC flux derived GPP throughout the growing season in 2003. These estimates of annual regional GPP were 649-664 g C M-2 for 2003 while the EC-derived annual GPP was 819-847 g C m-2. The annual difference was about 20-25%. The EC flux footprint of the tower was relatively homogeneous old black spruce while the concentration footprint, which was a few orders of magnitude larger than the flux footprint, covered boreal evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forests, grassland, cropland, and lakes. Nonforested land occupied about 10-50% of the concentration footprint depending on wind direction and speed and was less productive than the black spruce forest. The discrepancies between regional and local GPP estimates reflected the differences in underlying land surfaces represented by the different footprint areas.

Economic development, urbanization, energy consumption, transportation/motorization, and rapid population growth are major driving forces of air pollution in large cities, especially in megacities. Air pollution levels in developed countries have been decreasing dramatically in recent decades. However, in developing countries and in countries in transition, air pollution levels are still at relatively high levels, though the levels have been gradually decreasing or have remained stable during rapid economic development. In recent years, several hundred epidemiological studies have emerged showing adverse health effects associated with short-term and long-term exposure to air pollutants. Time-series studies conducted in Asian cities also showed similar health effects on mortality associated with exposure to particulate matter (PM), sulfur dioxide (SO 2), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and ozone (O3) to those explored in Europe and North America. The World Health Organization (WHO) published the ""WHO Air Quality Guidelines (AQGs), Global Update"" in 2006. These updated AQGs provide much stricter guidelines for PM, NO 2, SO2 and O3. Considering that current air pollution levels are much higher than the WHO-recommended AQGs, interim targets for these four air pollutants are also recommended for member states, especially for developing countries in setting their country-specific air quality standards. In conclusion, ambient air pollution is a health hazard. It is more important in Asian developing countries within the context of pollution level and population density. Improving air quality has substantial, measurable and important public health benefits. © 2008 The Japanese Society for Hygiene.","Air pollution; Health effects; Risk assessment; Time-series study; WHO Air Quality Guidelines","nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; Asia; conference paper; developing country; economic development; energy consumption; Europe; mortality; North America; particulate matter; population density; traffic and transport; urbanization; world health organization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49549110897

The ARPS model was chosen because of its nonhydrostatic dynamics, the generalized terrain-following height vertical coordinate, and the Arakawa-C horizontal grids, which are identical to the ones used in CMAQ, as well as its capabilities of simulating assorted-scale meteorological circulations within a large spectrum (especially at small scales). To assess its performance, the integrated ARPS-CMAQ modeling system was applied to Beijing, China, for simulating its PM10 concentration. The study region was delineated into a two-level nested-grid domain with spatial resolutions of 12 and 4 km, respectively. Three monitoring stations within the urban area of Beijing representing different categories of city function zones were selected to provide measurement data. The months of January 2002, August 2002, January 2004, and September 2004 were used as target months for model performance evaluation through scatter plots and correlation coefficient analysis between the simulated concentrations and observed data. The results show that a satisfactory agreement between modeled and observed data has been reached. The integrated ARPS-CMAQ modeling system was then employed to investigate two PM10 pollution episodes that occurred during the periods of July 516 and August 1219 of 2002, respectively. It was found that the transboundary PM10 contributions from Beijing's surrounding provinces played a leading role in the occurrences of both PM 10 pollution episodes. This indicates that, while Beijing needs to take positive steps to reduce its own pollution emissions, much effort should also be placed on demanding more pollution reduction and better environmental performance from its surrounding provinces. This study represents a continuous effort in combining meteorological models with air quality models for providing an integrated scientific modeling tool to city councils for addressing the crucial air quality issues. © Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2008.","Air quality; ARPS; CMAQ; Simulation","Air quality; Concentration (process); Correlation theory; Data acquisition; Mathematical models; Meteorology; Advanced Regional Prediction System (ARPS); Correlation coefficient analysis; Nonhydrostatic dynamics; Weather forecasting; Advanced Regional Prediction System Model; air quality; article; China; Community Multiscale Air Quality model; computer simulation; correlation coefficient; environmental exposure; hydrodynamics; intermethod comparison; mathematical model; meteorological phenomena; meteorology; non hydrostatic dynamics; nonhuman",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549146545

The study articulates and fits a school crime model to 712 high schools participating in the 2000 School Survey on Crime and Safety, confirming that school location and student socioeconomic status have moderate effects on school crime. Much of the contextual effects are mediated via school climate. School climate reflected by school size, student mobility, and student misbehavior affect school safety in profound and predicted ways. Larger size and schools with higher student transience and misbehavior predict higher levels of criminal incidents. School security program is correlated with lower school crime; however, the effect is small and nonsignificant. Tough on crime policy is associated with higher level of school crime, controlling for community and school variables. Consequently, a positive school climate in combination with necessary security control is recommended to improve school safety and reduce school crimes. © 2008 Corwin Press.","Punitive measures; School climate; School crime; School culture; School structure; Security programs; Structural equation model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42449135419

However, irregular morphology and severe agglomeration of particles were acquired due to nonuniform fusion of solid precursors. In this study, InTaO4 was synthesized by two sol-gel routes, the thermal hydrolysis and esterification methods. The precursors were indium (III) nitrate pentahydrate [ln(NO3)3] and tantalum(V) butoxide [Ta(OC4H9)5] dissolved in solutions. The InTaO4 powders with a unifonn grain size of 17.7 mn were successfully synthesized using the esterification method at a calcination temperature of 950 °C. A uniform InTaO4 thin film nearly 40 nm thick formed on an optical fiber at 1100 °C using the sol prepared by the esterification. method. For the first time, InTaO4 was evaluated by the photocatalytic activity of CO2 photo reduction, which was conducted in aqueous solution under visible light irradiation. Cocatalyst NiO was loaded on the surface of InTaO4 to further enhance the methanol yield. The methanol yields of NiO/InTaO4 by esterification method were significantly higher than those by solid-state fusion. The esterification method provided homogeneous mixing of Ta(OC4H9)5 and In(NO3)3, resulting in nano-sized InTaO4 with uniform crystallinity and superior photocatalytic activity. © 2008 Materials Research Society.",,"Agglomeration; Calcination; Esterification; Grain size and shape; Hydrolysis; Morphology; Photocatalysis; Sol-gel process; Homogeneous mixing; Solid-state fusion; Visible-light photocatalyst; Indium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649149022

In CFPCR, DNA cocktail is pumped through the constant temperature zones and reaches thermal equilibrium with the channel walls quickly due to its low thermal capacitance. In previous work, a polycarbonate CFPCR was designed with microchannels 150 μm deep, 50 μm wide, and 1.78 m long - including preheating and post-heating zones, fabricated with LIGA, and demonstrated. The high thermal resistance of the polycarbonate led to a high temperature gradient in the micro-device at steady-state and was partly responsible for the low amplification yield. Several steps were taken to ensure that there were three discrete, uniform temperature zones on the polycarbonate CFPCR device including: reducing the thickness of the CFPCR substrate to decrease thermal capacitance, using copper plates as heating elements to ensure a uniform temperature input, and making grooves between temperature zones to increase the resistance to lateral heat conduction between zones. Finite element analyses (FEA) were used to evaluate the macro temperature distribution in the CFPCR device and the micro temperature distribution along a single microchannel. At steady-state, the simulated CFPCR device had three discrete temperature zones, each with a uniform temperature distribution with a variation of ±0.3°C. An infrared (IR) camera was used to measure the steady-state temperature distribution in the prototype CFPCR and validated the simulation results. The temperature distributions along a microchannel at flow velocities from 0 mm/s to 6 mm/s were used to estimate the resulting temperatures of the DNA reagents in a single microchannel. A 500 bp DNA fragment was generated from a bacteriophage λ-DNA target using 20 cycles of PCR. The amplification efficiencies compared to a commercial thermal cycler were 72.7% (2 mm/s), 44% (3 mm/s), and 29.4% (4 mm/s). The amplification efficiency with the modified CFPCR device increased by 363% at 2 mm/s and 440% at 3 mm/s compared to amplification obtained using a CFPCR device with the same fluidic layout, (Hashimoto et al., Lab Chip 4:638, 2004) strictly due to the improved temperature distribution. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC 2007.","Continuous flow PCR; Finite element simulation; Micro PCR; PCR; Thermal management","Bacteriophages; DNA; Finite element method; Flow velocity; Heat resistance; Microchannels; Polycarbonates; Temperature distribution; Thermal cycling; Thermal gradients; Continuous flow polymerase chain reactors; Thermal equilibrium; Bioreactors; copper; DNA fragment; polycarbonate; article; bacteriophage; camera; continuous flow reactor; controlled study; denaturation; finite element analysis; gene amplification; heat tolerance; high temperature; microelectromechanical system; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; renaturation; simulation; steady state; temperature sensitivity; thermal conductivity; validation process; Computer Simulation; Equipment Design; Equipment Failure Analysis; Finite Element Analysis; Microchemistry; Microfluidic Analytical Techniques; Models, Theoretical; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Temperature; Thermal Conductivity; Enterobacteria phage lambda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40349097797

Due to differences in local environments and lifestyles the quantity and composition of waste often vary. This leads to differences in waste treatment methods and causes different volumes of greenhouse gases (GHGs), highlighting the need for local research. In this study the Life Cycle Inventory method was used with global warming indicator GHGs as the variables. By quantifying the data and adopting a region-based approach, this created a model of household MSWM in Taipei City, a metropolitan region in Taiwan. To allow analysis and comparison a compensatory system was then added to expand the system boundary. The results of the analysis indicated that out of all the solid waste management sub-models for a function unit, recycling was the most effective method for reducing GHG emissions while using kitchen food waste as swine feeding resulted in the most GHG emissions. As for the impact of waste collection vehicles on emissions, if the efficiency of transportation could be improved and energy consumption reduced, this will help solid waste management to achieve its goal of reducing GHG emissions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Numerous studies examining short-term effects of air pollution show significant associations between ambient levels of particulate matter (PM) and other air pollutants and increases in premature mortality and hospitalizations for cardiovascular and respiratory illnesses. Several well-designed epidemiological studies confirmed the adverse long-term effects of PM on both mortality and morbidity. Epidemiological studies also document significant associations between ozone (O3), sulfur (SO2), and nitrogen oxides (NOx) and adverse health outcomes; however, the effects of gaseous pollutants are less well documented. Subpopulations that are more susceptible to air pollution include children, the elderly, those with cardiorespiratory disease, and socioeconomically deprived individuals. Canada-wide standards for ambient air concentrations of PM2.5 and O3 were set in 2000, providing air quality targets to be achieved by 2010. In the United States, the Clean Air Act provides the framework for the establishment and review of National Ambient Air Quality Standards for criteria air pollutants and the establishment of emissions standards for hazardous air pollutants. The 1996 European Union's enactment of the Framework Directive for Air Quality established the process for setting Europe-wide limit values for a series of pollutants. The Clean Air for Europe program was established by the European Union to review existing limit values, emission ceilings, and abatement protocols, as set out in the current legislation. These initiatives serve as the legislative framework for air quality management in North America and Europe.

The secondary spreading effect which occurs upon introduction of humid air on NaCl deposited zinc surfaces was strongly dependent on the CO2 and SO2 content of the introduced air. Ambient level of CO2 (350 ppm) resulted in a relatively low spreading effect, whereas the lower level of CO2 (&lt;5 ppm) caused a much faster spreading over a larger area. In the presence of SO2, the secondary spreading effect was absent which could limit the cathodic process in this case. At &lt;5 ppm CO2, the corrosion is more localized, with the formation of simonkolleite (Zn5(OH)8Cl2 · H2O), zincite (ZnO) and sodium carbonate (Na2CO3), and a larger effective cathodic area. At 350 ppm CO2, the corrosion is more general and formation of simonkolleite, hydrozincite (Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2) and sodium carbonate was observed. Sodium carbonate was mainly formed in more alkaline areas, in the inner edge of the electrolyte droplet and in the secondary spreading area. Oxidation of sulphur and concomitant sulphate formation was enhanced in the presence of NaCl particles, due to the formation of a droplet, the separation of the anodic and cathodic areas and the accompanying differences in chemical composition and pH in the surface electrolyte. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Design: Retrospective 10-year case note review. Setting: Tertiary referral hospital. Patients: We reviewed retrospective case notes for 30 treated ears in 29 consecutive patients with CM (ie, loss of the tympanic membrane for longer than 1 month, refractory to conservative medical treatment) who underwent carbon dioxide laser microsurgery between 1995 and 2004, excluding patients who had undergone previous otologic surgery such as tympanoplasty. Interventions: Carbon dioxide laser microsurgery for resurfacing the nonepithelialized tympanic membrane was performed using local anesthesia. Main Outcome Measures: Resolution of disease in the affected tympanic membrane. Results: Of 30 affected ears, 22 demonstrated total resolution of CM, 7 demonstrated partial resolution, and the status of 1 ear remained unchanged at the end of follow-up (mean,19.7 months). Revision laser therapy was performed in 3 ears, resulting in total resolution of disease in 1 ear. Time to total resolution of disease ranged from 1 to 16 months (mean, 2.95 months). Conclusions: We used carbon dioxide laser microsurgery to treat intractable primary CM and describe its efficacy in a retrospective review of laser resurfacing covering 10 years. We believe that laser microsurgery has the advantages of less invasiveness and higher applicability compared with aggressive surgical treatment. In patients with CM refractory to conservative medical treatment, carbon dioxide laser microsurgery could be an effective alternative when aggressive surgical procedures are not under consideration. ©2008 American Medical Association.

Significant reductions in energy and emissions are derived from the decrease of energy-intensive production with virgin materials. In many cities, competing priorities can lead to limited consideration given to system optimal collection and processing strategies that can drive down costs and increase revenue while simultaneously reducing system energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. We evaluate three alterations to a hypothetical California city's recycling network to discern the conditions under which the changes constitute system improvements to cost, energy, and emissions. The system initially operates with a collection zoning scheme that does not mitigate the impact of seasonal variations in consumer tonnage. In addition, two collection organizations operate redundantly, collecting recyclables from different customer types on the same street network. Finally, the system is dual stream, meaning recyclables are separated at the curbside. In some scenarios, this practice can limit the consumer participation rate leading to lower collection quantities. First, we evaluate a ""business as usual"" (BAU) scenario and find that the system operates at a $1.7 M/yr loss but still avoids a net 18.7 GJ and 1700 kg of greenhouse gas equivalent (GGE) per ton of material recycled. Second, we apply an alternative zoning scheme for collection that creates a uniform daily pickup demand throughout the year reducing costs by $0.2 M/yr, energy by 30 MJ/ton, and GHG emissions by 2 kg GGE/on. Next, the two collection organizations are consolidated into a single entity further reducing vehicle fleet size and weekly vehicle miles traveled resulting in savings from BAU of $0.3 M/yr, 100 MJ/ton, and 8 kg GGE/ton. Lastly, we evaluate a switch to a single-stream system (where recyclables are commingled). We show that single-stream recycling can increase the total amount of material collected to a degree that lowers overall net cost ($0.2 M/yr) and leads to further reductions in energy use (210 MJ/ton) and emissions(16 kg GGE/ton). However, there can be circumstances in which maintaining a consolidated dual stream system is preferred over single stream. A sensitivity analysis is also performed and a discussion is presented addressing the applicability of this city network to others. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Sensitivity analysis; Societies and institutions; Cost reductions; Single-stream recycling; Recycling; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Recycling; Sensitivity analysis; Societies and institutions; cost-benefit analysis; emission; energy use; greenhouse gas; recycling; sensitivity analysis; urban area; article; cost control; energy; exhaust gas; greenhouse gas; recycling; seasonal variation; United States; Air Pollutants; California; Cities; Conservation of Energy Resources; Conservation of Natural Resources; Cost Control; Greenhouse Effect; Refuse Disposal; California; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41849121493

Here, we show for the first time systematically that the luminescence intensity is closely correlated with the local electric field induced by the molecular dipole. A strong electric field may facilitate radiationless decay channels with a charge-transfer nature, leading to a high quenching rate. Consistent with this conclusion, which is derived from the red DCV/2DCV and green CHO/2CHO, our new blue fluorophore DPV with an essentially zero dipole moment has successfully achieved one of the best electrofluorescent blue OLEDs. At the same time, by doping the highly dipolar DCV into an isolated environment with the low-polarity Alq3 as the host matrix, we obtained a very high performance of saturated yellow OLEDs as well, This is possibly due to the reduction of emission-quenching dipoles from the neighboring molecules. Our results have provided an important insight in designing luminescent materials, as follows: molecular dipole moments should be kept at a low magnitude to avoid quenching induced by a strong local electric field in the chromophore. © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

The advantages in terms of primary energy saving are well established. However, the potential of combined heat and power (CHP) and combined cooling heat and power (CCHP) systems for reducing the emission of hazardous greenhouse gases (GHG) needs to be further investigated. This paper presents and discusses a novel approach, based upon an original indicator called trigeneration CO2 emission reduction (TCO2ER), to assess the emission reduction of CO2 and other GHGs from CHP and CCHP systems with respect to the separate production. The indicator is defined in function of the performance characteristics of the CHP and CCHP systems, represented with black-box models, and of the GHG emission characteristics from conventional sources. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown in the companion paper (Part II: Analysis techniques and application cases) with application to various cogeneration and trigeneration solutions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

While policies that encourage green roofs exist atthe local and regional level, installation costs remain at a premium and deter investment in this technology. The objective of this paper is to quantitatively integrate the range of stormwater, energy, and air pollution benefits of green roofs into an economic model that captures the building-specific scale. Currently, green roofs are primarily valued on increased roof longevity, reduced stormwater runoff, and decreased building energy consumption. Proper valuation of these benefits can reduce the present value of a green roof if investors look beyond the upfront capital costs. Net present value (NPV) analysis comparing a conventional roof system to an extensive green roof system demonstrates that at the end of the green roof lifetime the NPV for the green roof is between 20.3 and 25.2% less than the NPV for the conventional roof over 40 years. The additional upfront investment is recovered at the time when a conventional roof would be replaced. Increasing evidence suggests that green roofs may play a significant role in urban air quality improvement. For example, uptake of NOX is estimated to range from $1683 to $6383 per metric ton of NOX reduction. These benefits were included in this study, and results translate to an annual benefit of $895-3392 for a 2000 square meter vegetated roof. Improved air quality leads to a mean NPV for the green roof that is 24.5-40.2% less than the mean conventional roof NPV. Through innovative policies, the inclusion of air pollution mitigation and the reduction of municipal stormwater infrastructure costs in economic valuation of environmental benefits of green roofs can reduce the cost gap that currently hinders U.S. investment in green roof technology. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Energy utilization; Environmental engineering; Regulatory compliance; Vegetation; Economic model; Stormwater runoff; Roofs; runoff; storm water; Energy utilization; Environmental engineering; Regulatory compliance; Roofs; Vegetation; atmospheric pollution; cost-benefit analysis; economic analysis; environmental effect; environmental policy; pollution control; probability; roof; urban area; valuation; air pollution; air quality; article; building; economic evaluation; energy; energy consumption; model; United States; urban area; vegetation; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Conservation of Energy Resources; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Facility Design and Construction; Models, Economic; Nitrogen Oxides; Plants; North America; United States; Nucleopolyhedrovirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41849141930

Oceanographically, however, they are very different. The Arctic is a deep basin surrounded almost completely by extensive shallow continental shelves and continental land masses. Large river systems (Chapter 2) discharge significant volumes of fresh water and sediment into the Arctic basin, some of them carrying substantial pollution, and exchange with the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans is highly constrained. In direct contrast, the Antarctic is a single isolated land mass surrounded on all sides by a deep ocean contiguous with the three great ocean basins (Fig. 21.1). Climate change has been identified as the key environmental trend in both polar regions, with the most likely effect in the marine environment being mediated through changes in sea-ice dynamics (Clarke & Harris2003) (Table 21.1). The polar regions play a critical role in the regulation of global climate, and it is expected that future climatic shifts will be particularly pronounced at high latitudes (IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] 2001a). The precise patterns of change and the feedbacks that influence these are, however, poorly understood and our ability to predict the future is greatly limited by this uncertainty. MAJOR ARCTIC TRENDS Current expectations are that the Arctic region will be the first to experience substantial climate change, with a possible rise in average surface air temperature of 4–5 °C by the middle of this century (Stouffer et al. 1989; Manabe et al. 1991; IPCC 2001a). © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2008.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-67650847646

The two study areas are located in north-central and east-central New Mexico and are separated by 200 km. Each section contains abundant paleosols of varying maturity with features that reflect an arid to semiarid climate. There is little pedogenic variation throughout the strata at each location, and a typical paleosol profile is about 1 m thick and has an AB-Bw-Bk-BC horizon succession. Bkm, Bss, Bssk, or Bssg horizons are present in some paleosols. Micromorphological features suggest dominantly well-drained sola (e.g., abundant carbonate nodules, illuviated clay) with minor periods of moist or saturated conditions (e.g., FeMn concretions, FeMn coatings and hypocoatings, sepic-plasmic fabrics). Trace fossils are abundant in these strata and are dominated by Taenidium serpentinum and root traces. Depth-to-carbonate functions estimate that mean annual precipitation was between 200 and 450 +/- 95 mm. Relative to location 1 (eastern New Mexico), location 2 (north-central New Mexico) produced higher paleo-precipitation estimates and has stronger and more abundant sepic-plasmic fabrics in thin sections. The presence of a gleyed paleosol, Camborygma eumnkenomos, and slickensides at location 2 also suggests conditions wetter than at location 1. Taxonomically, all of the paleosols in this study appear to be Entisols or Aridisols and can be grouped into seven representative pedotypes of varying maturity. By comparing these paleosols to modern soils, this study demonstrates that the Late Triassic Western Interior during the Late Norian to Rhaetian was arid to semiarid and supported a desert shrub environment that had localized and periodic moist or saturated soil conditions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The air quality issues of most concern to CAFO vary but generally include ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, particulate matter, volatile organic compounds, greenhouse gases, and odors. Air pollutants may be regulated by federal and state laws or by nuisance complaints. The United States Environmental Protection Agency, and poultry, swine, and dairy industries recently agreed to the National Air Emissions Monitoring System to fund research on atmospheric emissions from production farms in the United States. Air quality regulations may be based on actual emissions, atmospheric concentrations, or human perception, or via limiting the size or location of CAFO. Measuring the concentrations or emissions of most air pollutants is expensive and complex. Because of spatial and temporal variability, concentrations and emissions must be measured continuously over an extended period of time. Because different methods or models can give different results with the same data set, a multitude of methods should be used simultaneously to assure emissions are reasonable. The ""best"" method to measure concentrations andemissions will depend upon atmospheric concentrations, cost, facility characteristics, objectives, and other factors. In the future, requirements formonitoring of air emissions from CAFO will probably increase. Reliable processbased models need to be developed so that emissions of air pollutants can be estimated from readily obtained diet, animal, facility, and environmental variables. Auditors will need to be trained in a variety of disciplines including animal sciences, chemistry, engineering, micrometeorology, instrumentation, modeling, and logic. © 2008 American Registry of Professional Animal Scientists.","Air quality; Concentrated animal feeding operations; Dispersion; Modeling; Regulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77954114330

We demonstrate that for transmitted light imaging, an LED can replace the traditional tungsten filament bulb while offering longer life; no color temperature change with intensity change; reduced emission in the infrared region, which is important for live cell imaging; and reduced cost of ownership. We show a direct substitution of the typical tungsten bulb with a commercially available LED and demonstrated the color stability by imaging a histology section over a wide range of light intensities. For fluorescent imaging, where the typical illumination sources are mercury or xenon lamps, we demonstrate that LEDs offer advantages of providing a longer lifespan, having a more constant intensity output over time, more homogeneous illumination, and significantly lower photon dose.

Aerosols are originally released at the surface as a consequence of anthropogenic activities, biomass burning, soil mobilization, etc. After being vertically transported into the FT, they are exposed to the long-range transport (LRT) and may subside to impact, in turn, surface air pollution in remote places. Using 5400 h of routine Lidar observations conducted at the SIRTA observatory in the Paris area (France), we identified 154 free tropospheric aerosol layers continuously monitored during their downward transport into the local PBL. One of these events-associated to a Saharan dust outbreak-is thoroughly documented in a case study. And a climatological analysis of surface PM10 levels recorded at air quality monitoring stations allows the impact of FT to PBL transport of aerosols to be quantified.

Countries striving to this end are seeking to reassess their energy systems with a view toward planning energy programs and strategies in line with sustainable development goals and objectives. Turkey's demand for energy and electricity is increasing rapidly. Since 1990, energy consumption has increased at an annual average rate of 4.3%. Turkey is heavily dependent on expensive imported energy resources that place a big burden on the economy and air pollution is becoming a great environmental concern in the country. As would be expected, the rapid expansion of energy production and consumption has brought with it a wide range of environmental issues at the local, regional and global levels. With respect to global environmental issues, Turkey's carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions have grown along with its energy consumption. States have played a leading role in protecting the environment by reducing emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). In this regard, renewable energy resources appear to be the one of the most efficient and effective solutions for clean and sustainable energy development in Turkey. Turkey's geographical location has several advantages for extensive use of most of these renewable energy sources.

H7V 1B7, Canada","The industrialization and the demographic expansion have both influenced the biogeochemical cycle of hydrogen (H2), carbon monoxide (CO) and carbon dioxide (CO2). In the actual context, knowledge about the spatial distribution of the natural sources and sinks of these trace gases is then crucial to infer possible effects of climate and land use changes on their global budget. This article reports the H2, CO and CO2 concentrations and micrometeorological fluxes measured during 1 year in a rural area of the mixed wood ecozone of Canada. Land use represents a critical issue in the control of trace gas natural sources or sinks of that region, which is the most densely habited in Canada. On average, the site emitted CO2 at a rate of 7.7 g m-2 d-1 and consumed H2 and CO at 0.34 and 5.1 mg m-2 d-1, respectively. Temperature was the most important factor affecting the H2 and CO surface to air exchanges. The strength of the soil sink was maximal at the end of the summer, while H2 and CO emissions were observed at the snow-melting period. In winter, H2 and CO depositions were attributed to their oxidation by photochemically active compounds within the snow cover. When soil temperature was above 10 °C, trace gas fluxes followed a well-defined diurnal cycle. H2 and CO2 deposition rates were positively correlated with H2O fluxes, while CO followed the inverse trend. CO2 diurnal variations resulted from a balance between photosynthesis and soil respiration, while some biotic and abiotic factors were proposed to explain the trend observed for H2. In the case of CO, emissions originating from heat- and photo-induced reactions were involved in the attenuation in the strength of the soil sink during daytime. Measured fluxes were compared with the literature to show the relative importance of the rural areas in the studied trace gases budget.

Greatly enhanced investment in agriculture by a broad range of stakeholders will be required if this sector is to meet the food security requirements of tomorrow's Africa. However, production uncertainty associated with between and within season rainfall variability remains a fundamental constraint to many investors who often over estimate the negative impacts of climate induced uncertainty. Climate change is likely to make matters worse with increases in rainfall variability being predicted. The ability of agricultural communities and agricultural stakeholders in SSA to cope better with the constraints and opportunities of current climate variability must first be enhanced for them to be able to adapt to climate change and the predicted future increase in climate variability. Tools and approaches are now available that allow for a better understanding, characterization and mapping of the agricultural implications of climate variability and the development of climate risk management strategies specifically tailored to stakeholders needs. Application of these tools allows the development and dissemination of targeted investment innovations that have a high probability of biophysical and economic success in the context of climate variability. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Though a lot of research has been done to investigate the functional relationship linking air quality and air pollution from transport, a further improvement in the knowing of this relationship is needed. The aim of this study was to analyze this relationship and to develop a more flexible framework to allow communication between transport emissions and air quality concentrations. This paper describes the development of this framework, suggests methodological tools to mitigate its problems and shows its application to the mega-city of Beijing, in P.R. China. The result of implementing this methodology would be a system providing high time/space resolution measurements of both air pollutant concentrations and traffic emissions data, as well as real-time transportation and dispersion modelling of those data. The key advantage of the system proposed would be the runtime integration of modelling, to interpret the data measured, with measurements, to validate the data modelled.

To characterize AQM in the United States, four examples that addressed local, regional, and global scale air pollution are described. These examples include: (1) the Hazardous Air Pollutants (HAPs) program, (2) National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) program, (3) ""Cap & Trade"" programs, and (4) U.S. global pollution control efforts. These four examples were chosen because each presents a different approach to AQM. This was not intended to be a comprehensive description of U.S. AQM programs, but rather representative of selected examples that highlight the themes of this program. Some general principles that are illustrated in the article and are considered important characteristics of U.S. AQM are: • Ensure open access to information and transparency in decision making. • Develop and sustain a well-trained workforce. • Facilitate training, networking, and technology transfer among air quality managers. • Integrate planning and coordination of efforts across jurisdictions (across federal, state, and local agencies). • Educate and encourage participation of stakeholders. • Balance of societal benefits and costs. • Apply innovative approaches, where possible. • Fund research to improve the scientific basis for problem identification and effective AQM strategy development.

In order to investigate the role of fungi and their metabolisation activity, we collected airborne fungi using a biosampler in an urban location of Montreal, Quebec, Canada (45° 28′ N, 73° 45′ E). After isolation on Sabouraud dextrose agar, we exposed isolated colonies to dicarboxylic acids (C2-C7), a major group of organic aerosols and monitored their growth. Depending on the acid, total fungi numbers varied from 35 (oxalic acid) to 180 CFU/mL (glutaric acid). Transformation kinetics of malonic acid, presumably the most abundant dicarboxylic acid, at concentrations of 0.25 and 1.00 mM for isolated airborne fungi belonging to the genera Aspergillus, Penicillium, Eupenicillium, and Thysanophora with the fastest transformation rate are presented. The initial concentration was halved within 4.5 and 11.4 days. Other collected fungi did not show a significant degradation and the malonic acid concentration remained unchanged (0.25 and 1.00 mM) within 20 days. Degradation of acid with formation of metabolites was followed using high performance liquid chromatography-ultraviolet detection (HPLC/UV) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), as well as monitoring of 13C labelled malonic acid degradation with solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). Using GC/MS we identified two processes driving chemical modifications of organic aerosol solutions: (I) formation of metabolites within several days, and (II) rapid release (≤ 2 min) of organic molecules from fungal species upon the insertion of taxa in organic aerosol solutions.

Fast flame ionization detectors and non-dispersive infrared fast CO and CO2 detectors are used as the principal diagnostics. Measured component trends are shown with detailed explanations. CFR engine exhaust unburned hydrocarbon levels are shown to be 3 to 7 times higher for startup than for steady state operation depending on spark timing and fuelling. Torque is found to be relatively insensitive to fuelling within 5 per cent of stoichiometric. Additionally, in-cylinder and exhaust CO levels are strong functions of startup enrichment. Exhaust CO, much easier to measure than in-cylinder CO, could be used to meter fuel more tightly during startup in order to reduce undesirable emissions. Exhaust CO levels can be at or below stabilized engine steady state levels depending on fuelling levels.

On geological timescales, a quasi-equilibrium between ecosystem (biome) distribution and climate exists, although the slow growth of forests and the slow buildup of organic matter in soils and peat bogs create substantial nonlinear responses at the timescale of centuries. The current interest in global change 'impacts' on the biosphere is due to the novel, potentially devastating nature of 'anthropogenic' climate change in many ecosystems. Human society associates high values with the biosphere, due to its intrinsic value and also as provider of 'ecosystem services' such as food, fiber, clean water, as well as spiritual and other values. The concept of 'vulnerability' has been employed to describe this human view on biospheric change. It allows the consistent assessment of biospheric change involving a common metric. It also includes the formulation of future 'risk', expressed by the scenario-based analysis of losses that may arise if trends of global change are extrapolated into the future. This presentation of impacts focuses not only on changes brought about by anthropogenic perturbations due to global processes such as the emission of greenhouse gases (GHGs) but also the increasing pressure from land-use change including land degradation and deforestation. Global change impacts are, on the one hand, documented from observations and careful attribution to driving forces, and, on the other hand, recognized by consideration of 'expected impacts' due to future trends in drivers, expressed as scenarios. These scenarios are not predictions, because the precise nature of future drivers cannot be known as they depend on human demography, economic development, application of technology, climate protection policy, and other factors. Scenarios are not speculative, however, because they rely on established causal relationships between driving forces and ecosystem response. For example, since the link between GHG emissions, global temperatures, and sea-level rise is well established, and since quick stabilization of GHG concentrations is very unlikely, it can therefore be inferred with high confidence that coastal ecosystems are at risk worldwide, even in places where currently no damage is observed yet. Numerical models for the assessment of future impacts (developed during 25 years by many groups worldwide) are now a mature technique for the consideration of nonlinear impacts and the combination of multiple forcings - as is amply illustrated by the recent assessments of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In the following, a summary will first be given about the nature of currently observed changes in the biosphere that can be attributed to global change.

For their Third Assessment Report in 2001, the United Nations International Programme on Climate Change developed a set of economic development scenarios, which were then run with the four major general circulation models (GCM) to estimate the anthropogenesis-forced climate change. These GCMs produce worldwide grids of predicted monthly temperature, cloud, and precipitation deviations from the period 1961–1990. As this period is the same used for several major typical meteorological year data sets, these typical data sets can be used as a starting point for modifying weather files to represent predicted climate change. Over the past 50 years, studies of urban heat islands (UHI) or urbanization have provided detailed measurements of the diurnal and seasonal patterns and differences between urban and rural climatic conditions. While heat islands have been shown to be a function of both population and microclimatic and site conditions, they can be generalized into a predictable diurnal and seasonal pattern. Although the scientific literature is full of studies looking at the impact of climate change driven by human activity, there is very little research on the impact of climate change or urban heat islands on building operation and performance across the world. This article presents the methodology used to create weather files which represent climate change scenarios in 2100 and heat island impacts today. For this study, typical and extreme meteorological weather data were created for 25 locations (20 climate regions) to represent a range of predicted climate change and heat island scenarios for building simulation. Then prototypical small office buildings were created to represent typical, good, and low-energy practices around the world. The simulation results for these prototype buildings provide a snapshot view of the potential impacts of the set of climate scenarios on building performance. This includes location-specific building response, such as fuel swapping as heating and cooling ratios change, impacts on environmental emissions, impacts on equipment use and longevity comfort issues, and how low-energy building design incorporating renewables can significantly mitigate any potential climate variation. In this article, examples of how heat island and climate change scenarios affect diurnal patterns are presented as well as the annual energy performance impacts for three of the 25 locations. In cold climates, the net change to annual energy use due to climate change will be positive – reducing energy use on the order of 10% or more. For tropical climates, buildings will see an increase in overall energy use due to climate change, with some months increasing by more than 20% from current conditions. Temperate, mid-latitude climates will see the largest change but it will be a swapping from heating to cooling, including a significant reduction of 25% or more in heating energy and up to 15% increase in cooling energy. Buildings which are built to current standards such as ASHRAE/IESNA Standard 90.1-2004 will still see significant increases in energy demand over the twenty-first century. Low-energy buildings designed to minimize energy use will be the least affected, with impacts in the range of 5–10%. Unless the way buildings are designed, built, and operated changes significantly over the next decades, buildings will see substantial operating cost increases and possible disruptions in an already strained energy supply system. © 2008 International Building Performance Simulation Association (IBPSA).","Climate change; Future simulation; Historical weather; Urban heat island; Weather data","Architectural design; Atmospheric temperature; Buildings; Climate models; Energy utilization; Environmental design; Environmental impact; Meteorology; Office buildings; Precipitation (meteorology); Climate change scenarios; Environmental emissions; Future simulation; General circulation model; Scientific literature; Typical meteorological year; Urban heat island; Weather data; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-77952609865

Recent work suggests that fungal rather than bacterial pathways dominate N transformation in desert soils. We evaluated this hypothesis by comparing the contributions of bacteria and fungi to N 2O production at control and N fertilized sites within a semiarid grassland in central New Mexico (USA). Soil samples were taken from the rhizosphere of blue grama (B. gracilus) and the microbiotic crusts that grow in open areas between the bunch grasses. Soils incubated at 30% or 70% water holding capacity, were exposed to one of three biocide treatments (control, cycloheximide or streptomycin). After 48 h, N2O and CO2 production were quantified along with the activities of several extracellular enzymes. N2O production from N fertilized soils was higher than that of control soils (165 vs. 41 pmol h-1 g-1), was higher for crust soil than for rhizosphere soil (108 vs. 97 pmol h-1 g -1), and increased with soil water content (146 vs. 60 pmol h -1 g-1). On average, fungicide (cycloheximide) addition reduced N2O production by 85% while increasing CO2 production by 69%; bactericide (streptomycin) reduced N2O by 53% with mixed effects on CO2 production. N2O production was significantly correlated with C and N mineralization potential as measured by assays for glycosidic and proteolytic enzymes, and with extractable nitrate and ammonium. Our data indicate that fungal nitrifier denitrification and bacterial autotrophic nitrification dominate N transformation in this ecosystem and that N2O production is highly sensitive to soil cover, N deposition and moisture. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Denitrification; Extracellular enzyme activity; Fungi; Nitrous oxide; Semiarid grasslands; Sevilleta LTER","bacterium; bioassay; biomass; comparative study; enzyme activity; fungus; grassland; hypothesis testing; nitrification; nitrous oxide; semiarid region; New Mexico; North America; United States; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bouteloua gracilis; Fungi; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349018357

Average PM2.5 24-h personal exposure was 0.29 mg/m3 and mean 48-h kitchen concentration was 1.269 mg/m3 for participating women using the traditional open fire (fogon). If these concentrations are typical of rural conditions in Mexico, a large fraction of the population is chronically exposed to levels of pollution far higher than ambient concentrations found by the Mexican government to be harmful to human health. Installation of an improved Patsari stove in these homes resulted in 74% reduction in median 48-h PM2.5 concentrations in kitchens and 35% reduction in median 24-h PM2.5 personal exposures. Corresponding reductions in CO were 77% and 78% for median 48-h kitchen concentrations and median 24-h personal exposures, respectively. The relationship between reductions in median kitchen concentrations and reductions in median personal exposures not only changed for different pollutants, but also differed between traditional and improved stove type, and by stove adoption category. If these reductions are typical, significant bias in the relationship between reductions in particle concentrations and reductions in health impacts may result, if reductions in kitchen concentrations are used as a proxy for personal exposure reductions when evaluating stove interventions. In addition, personal exposure reductions for CO may not reflect similar reductions for PM2.5. This implies that PM2.5 personal exposure measurements should be collected or indoor measurements should be combined with better time-activity estimates, which would more accurately reflect the contributions of indoor concentrations to personal exposures. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2008.","Biomass stoves; Carbon monoxide; Exposure bias; Indoor air pollution; Particulate matter","carbon monoxide; biomass; conference paper; cooking; environmental monitoring; exposure; female; health; heating; human; indoor air pollution; instrumentation; interview; methodology; Mexico; particulate matter; smoke; wood; Air Pollution, Indoor; Biomass; Carbon Monoxide; Cookery; Environmental Monitoring; Female; Heating; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Interviews as Topic; Mexico; Particulate Matter; Rural Health; Smoke; Wood",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549114018

The model considers an extended biomass-implicit reaction network for organic carbon degradation, which includes extracellular hydrolysis of macromolecular organic matter, fermentation, sulfate reduction, methanogenesis, AOM, acetogenesis and acetotrophy. Catabolic reaction rates are determined using a modified Monod rate expression that explicitly accounts for limitation by the in situ catabolic energy yields. The fraction of total sulfate reduction due to AOM in the sulfate-methane transition zone (SMTZ) at each site is calculated. The model provides an explanation for the methane tailing phenomenon which is observed here and in other marine sediments, whereby methane diffuses up from the SMTZ to the top of the core without being consumed. The tailing is due to bioenergetic limitation of AOM in the sulfate reduction zone, because the methane concentration is too low to engender favorable thermodynamic drive. AOM is also bioenergetically inhibited below the SMTZ at both sites because of high hydrogen concentrations (∼3-6 nM). The model results imply there is no straightforward relationship between pore water concentrations and the minimum catabolic energy needed to support life because of the highly coupled nature of the reaction network. Best model fits are obtained with a minimum energy for AOM of ∼11 kJ mol-1, which is within the range reported in the literature for anaerobic processes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Results show that population aging reduces long-term emissions, by almost 40% in a low population scenario, and effects of aging on emissions can be as large, or larger than, effects of technical change in some cases.

Eustatic-climatic, high-frequency changes, linked to the Earth's orbital perturbations, are considered at the origin of this hierarchy, where the elementary cycles record the precession and/or the obliquity periodicities, and the bundles and superbundles record the short- and long-eccentricity, respectively. These orbital cycles are superimposed on lower-frequency cycles (Trangressive/Regressive Facies Trends, T/RFTs), commonly made up of 2-5 superbundles. In a sequence stratigraphy approach, the superbundles and the T/RFTs have been interpreted in terms of depositional sequences and used for high-resolution, long-distance (regional-to supraregional) correlation, as well as to assemble orbital chronostratigraphic diagrams that quantify the minimum time required for each succession to stack up. The chronostratigraphic correlation carried out in central-southern Italy allowed us to show that the sedimentary record of the analyzed sequences may be considered quasi-continuous, at least at superbundle level, and to suggest numerical estimates for the time duration of the discussed intervals.","Cyclostratigraphy; High-resolution correlation; Orbital chronostratigraphy; Sequence stratigraphy","carbonate platform; chronostratigraphy; Cretaceous; cyclostratigraphy; diagenesis; facies analysis; progradation; sequence stratigraphy; stratigraphic correlation; texture; Italy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84918589198

The flowsheet includes all major units in a typical dehydration facility, that is: absorption column, flash unit, heat exchangers, regenerator, stripper, and reboiler. The base case operating conditions are taken to resemble field data from one of the existing TEG-dehydration units operating in United Arab Emirates (UAE). Using Aspen Plus, the flowsheet is then used to study the effects of different input parameters and operating conditions of the absorption column, the stripper and the overall plant, on BTEX emission, volatile organic components (VOCs) emission, TEG losses and water content (dew point) of the dehumidified natural gas. Contactor performance has been found to be most sensitive to disturbances in operating pressure and wet gas flow rate, whereas flow rate of stripping gas and temperature of inlet solvent have the major impact on the stripper performance. The potential of artificial neural network (ANN) to detect and diagnose process faults in the dehydration plant has also been explored. ANN successfully detects the disturbance severity levels in the input variables considered for the contactor. In particular, abnormal levels of BTEX concentrations in the rich solvent (exiting the contactor) are shown to precisely indicate the severity levels in the input variables. Faults in the stripper-regenerator unit have been perfectly predicted by the ANN for two symptoms (TEG emissions and BTEX emissions in vents) and to a lesser extent for faults in VOCs emissions. The best ANN prediction is obtained for the overall plant where the ANN simulates the imposed disturbances for three severity levels of imposed malfunctions for all symptoms considered. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The use of vermicompost (VC) and microbial inoculants (Azotobactor and phosphorus-solubilizing bacteria) to improve plant nutrition may address these issues. Effects of VC and microbial inoculants in combination with inorganic fertilizers on growth and yield of crops and soil health need to be better understood. The eastern Ghats region of Orissa, India, has a favorable climate for year-round cultivation of vegetables. An on-farm experiment with seven treatments including chemical fertilizers, VC, cow manure (CM), and microbial inoculants was carried out for 3 consecutive years during winters of 2001 to 2003, at Koraput, India, on a red soil to determine the most effective integrated nutrient management option for enhancing productivity of cabbage (Brassica oleracea L. Capitata group) and bell pepper (Capsicum annuum L.). Vermicompost appeared to be the best soil additive in both crops in terms of yield, net economic return, and water use efficiency (WUE). In bell pepper, use of VC+50% recommended rate of synthetic fertilizers (RRF) produced significantly higher yield over 100% RRF, with a net return increase of 29.8%. There was a similar effect for yield of cabbage. In the 50% RRF+VC treatment, WUE was 32.6% higher in bell pepper and 6.2% higher in cabbage over treatment with 100% RRF. Bulk density of the surface soil after 3 years was reduced; its organic carbon and available N and P status improved due to treatment with CM and VC. The data indicate that 5 Mtha-1 of VC can meet 50% of the fertilizer requirement of bell pepper and cabbage while providing higher productivity, income, and residual soil fertility.©2008 by The Haworth Press.","Cabbage; Economics; Integrated nutrient management; Pepper; Soil properties; Water use efficiency; Yield","Bacteria (microorganisms); Brassica oleracea; Brassica oleracea var. capitata; Capsicum annuum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-68149157058

Integrated assessments of greenhouse gas emissions have compared intensive cropping systems in industrialized countries, but such assessments have not been applied to common cropping systems of smallholder farmers in developing countries. We report an integrated assessment of greenhouse gas emissions in slash-and-burn agriculture and an alternative chop-and-mulch system in the Amazon Basin. The soil consumed atmospheric methane (CH4) under slash-and-burn treatment and became a net emitter of CH4 to the atmosphere under the mulch treatment. Mulching also caused about a 50% increase in soil emissions of nitric oxide and nitrous oxide and required greater use of fertilizer and fuel for farm machinery. Despite these significantly higher emissions of greenhouse gases during the cropping phase under the alternative chop-and-mulch system, calculated pyrogenic emissions in the slash-and-burn system were much larger, especially for CH4. The global warming potential CO2-equivalent emissions calculated for the entire crop cycles were at least five times lower in chop-and-mulch compared with slash-and-burn. The crop yields were similar for the two systems. While economic and logistical considerations remain to be worked out for alternatives to slash-and-burn, these results demonstrate a potential 'win-win' strategy for maintaining soil fertility and reducing net greenhouse gas emissions, thus simultaneously contributing to sustainability at both spatial scales. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biomass burning; CH4; Global warming potentials; Methane; Mulching; Nitric oxide; Nitrous oxide; Shifting agriculture; Soil","biomass burning; crop yield; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; mulching; nitric oxide; nitrous oxide; shifting cultivation; soil emission; Amazonia; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42949162515

Plant traits regulate net soil carbon storage by controlling carbon assimilation, its transfer and storage in belowground biomass, and its release from soil through respiration, fire and leaching. However, our mechanistic understanding of these processes is incomplete. Here, we present a mechanistic framework, based on the plant traits that drive soil carbon inputs and outputs, for understanding how alteration of vegetation composition will affect soil carbon sequestration under global changes. First, we show direct and indirect plant trait effects on soil carbon input and output through autotrophs and heterotrophs, and through modification of abiotic conditions, which need to be considered to determine the local carbon sequestration potential. Second, we explore how the composition of key plant traits and soil biota related to carbon input, release and storage prevail in different biomes across the globe, and address the biome-specific mechanisms by which plant trait composition may impact on soil carbon sequestration. We propose that a trait-based approach will help to develop strategies to preserve and promote carbon sequestration. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd/CNRS.","Biochemical stoichiometry; Biodiversity; C : N ratio; Carbon budget; Decomposition; Ecosystem functioning; Global change; Plant-soil feedback; Respiration; Soil organic carbon","carbon; biome; carbon sequestration; decomposition; functional role; soil carbon; adaptation; comparative study; ecosystem; metabolism; microbiology; plant; review; soil; Adaptation, Biological; Carbon; Ecosystem; Plants; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41849150021

Some of these targeted emission reductions could result from a switch from coal-fired to gas-fired electricity generation. The focus in this work lies on Western Europe, with the presence of the European Union Emission Trading Scheme (EU ETS). For the switching to occur, several conditions have to be fulfilled. First, an economical incentive must be present, i.e. a sufficiently high European Union Allowance (EUA) price together with a sufficiently low natural gas price. Second, the physical potential for switching must exist, i.e. at a given load, there must remain enough power plants not running to make switching possible. This paper investigates what possibilities exist for switching coal-fired plants for gas-fired plants, dependent on the load level (the latter condition above). A fixed allowance cost and a variable natural gas price are assumed. The method to address GHG emission reduction potentials is first illustrated in a methodological case. Next, the GHG emission reduction potentials are addressed for several Western European countries together with a relative positioning of their electricity generation. GHG emission reduction potentials are also compared with simulation results. GHG emission reduction potentials tend to be significant. The Netherlands have a very widespread switching zone, so GHG emission reduction is practically independent of electricity generation. Other counties, like Germany, Spain and Italy could reduce GHG emissions significantly by switching. With an allowance cost following the switch level of a 50% efficient gas-fired plant and a 40% efficient coal-fired plant in the summer season (like in 2005), the global GHG emission reduction (in the electricity generating sector) for the eight modeled zones could amount to 19%. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, ground OFMSW and pulverized coal (PC) were used for co-firing tests. The tests were carried out in a bench-scale bubbling FBC. Coal and bio-waste fuels are quite different in composition. Ash composition of the bio-waste fuels is fundamentally different from ash composition of the coal. Chlorine (Cl) in the MSW may affect operation by corrosion. Ash deposits reduce heat transfer and also may result in severe corrosion at high temperatures. Nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) assessments can play an important role in a strategy to control carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions while raising revenue. Regulations such as subsidies for oil, liquid petroleum gas (LPG) for natural gas powered vehicles, and renewables, especially biomass lines, to reduce emissions may be more cost-effective than assessments.

A long-term trend of visibility in Guangzhou (one of the largest cities in PRD) shows that between 1954 and 2006, there is a rapid change in visibility. Between 1954 and 1972, low visibility has the smallest occurrence (less than a few days per year). Between 1972 and 1980, the visibility condition is within a transition period, and the occurrence of low visibility increases rapidly. Between 1980 and 2006, the occurrence of low visibility remains very high (150 days year-1), suggesting that the city of Guangzhou is often under low-visibility conditions since the 1980s. In order to understand the causes of the low visibility in Guangzhou, we analyze physical and chemical characterizations of a low-visibility event occurring between 15 and 29 November 2005. The analysis suggests that high concentration of aerosol particles is a major cause for the low visibility. The threshold aerosol concentration that is corresponding to the low visibility (&lt;10 km) is about 120 μg m-3. Further analysis indicates that the relationship between aerosol concentrations and visibility appears in a non-linearity correlation. When aerosol concentrations are very high (above 120 μg m-3), the change in visibility is not sensitive to aerosol concentration. By contrast, when aerosol concentrations are &lt;120 μg m-3, the change in visibility is very sensitive to aerosol concentrations. This study also shows that absorbing aerosol particles (such as element carbon (EC)) play important roles in the reduction of visibility. In most cases, the extremely low visibility (&lt;2 km) is often resulted from high EC concentrations (above 15 μg m-3). In averaged condition, small scattering aerosol particles (&lt;1 μm in radius) have the largest contribution to the reduction of visibility (about 70%). By contrast, large scattering particles have the smallest contribution to the reduction of visibility. This analysis implies that the persistent low visibility is mainly resulted from small aerosol particles, including both scattering and absorbing particles. In order to improve the visibility in the Guangzhou region, the reduction of small particle emissions is urgently needed. This study suggests that there are two important steps to improve the visibility in Guangzhou. First, the aerosol concentration should be reduced to less than the threshold value (120 μg m-3). Second, a further decrease in aerosols from its threshold value will lead to a significant improvement in visibility due to the non-linearity relationship between aerosol and visibility. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The potential increase in nitrate, when sulfate is reduced and the associated ammonia is released, can negate the sulfate mass reduction. Current regional-scale air quality models do not reproduce the present-day levels of total ammonia and total nitrate, leading to possible errors in the air quality model predictions of future nitrate concentrations. The objective of this study is to quantify the effects of errors in the total-ammonia and total-nitrate budgets on nitrate relative response (RR), defined as the percent change in particulate nitrate stemming from reductions in SO2 emissions. This objective is addressed through three sensitivity studies using the Community Multiscale Air Quality model (CMAQ). These studies assess the sensitivity of the nitrate RR (%) to (1) errors in ammonia emissions, (2) errors in the heterogeneous production of nitrate from N2O5, and (3) errors in the NOX emissions. The results indicate that nitrate RRs due to SO2 emission reductions are much more sensitive to errors in the total-ammonia budget than to errors in the total-nitrate budget. The sensitivity of the nitrate RR to NOX emissions is only moderate and is due primarily to the effect of NOX changes on sulfate production, rather than on total nitrate. Also, a strong relationship was found between the nitrate RR and the Adjusted Gas Ratio (free ammonia adjusted for the degree of sulfate neutralization divided by total nitrate). © 2007.","Emission control response; Inorganic aerosols; Nitrate relative reduction factors; Non-linearity; Particulate nitrate replacement; RRF; Sensitivity analysis","Ammonia; Ammonium compounds; Budget control; Nitrates; Sensitivity analysis; Sulfur dioxide; Emission control response; Inorganic aerosols; Nitrate relative reduction factors; Particulate nitrate replacement; Air quality; ammonia; nitrate; sulfur dioxide; air quality; ammonia; atmospheric modeling; emission control; nitrate; particulate matter; sulfur dioxide; air analysis; air pollutant; air quality; analytical error; article; chemical analysis; particulate matter; priority journal; sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38749122072

In the United States, terrestrial carbon sequestration in private and public forests offsets approximately 11% of all GHG emissions from all sectors of the economy on an annual basis. Although much of the attention on forest carbon sequestration strategy in the United States has been on the role of private lands, public forests in the United States represent approximately 20% of the U.S. timberland area and also hold a significantly large share (30%) of the U.S. timber volume. With such a large standing timber inventory, these forested lands have considerable impact on the U.S. forest carbon balance. To help decision makers understand the carbon implications of potential changes in public timberland management, we compared a baseline timber harvest scenario with two alternative harvest scenarios and estimated annual carbon stock changes associated with each. Our analysis found that a ""no timber harvest"" scenario eliminating harvests on public lands would result in an annual increase of 17-29 million metric tonnes of carbon (MMTC) per year between 2010 and 2050-as much as a 43% increase over current sequestration levels on public timberlands and would offset up to 1.5% of total U.S. GHG emissions. In contrast, moving to a more intense harvesting policy similar to that which prevailed in the 1980s may result in annual carbon losses of 27-35 MMTC per year between 2010 and 2050. These losses would represent a significant decline (50-80%) in anticipated carbon sequestration associated with the existing timber harvest policies. If carbon sequestration were valued in the marketplace as part of a GHG offset program, the economic value of sequestered carbon on public lands could be substantial relative to timber harvest revenues. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Elevated carbon dioxide (CO2) increases photosynthesis and leaf area index (LAI) of soybeans and thus may increase εi and εc; elevated O3 may have the opposite effect. Knowing if elevated CO2 and O3 differentially affect physiological more than structural components of the ecosystem may reveal how these elements of global change will ultimately alter productivity. The effects of elevated CO2 and O3 on an intact soybean ecosystem were examined with Soybean Free Air Concentration Enrichment (SoyFACE) technology where large field plots (20-m diameter) were exposed to elevated CO2 (∼550 μmol mol-1) and elevated O3 (1.2 × ambient) in a factorial design. Aboveground biomass, LAI and light interception were measured during the growing seasons of 2002, 2003 and 2004 to calculate εi and εc. A 15%; increase in yield (averaged over 3 years) under elevated CO2 was caused primarily by a 12% stimulation in εc, as εi increased by only 3%. Though accelerated canopy senescence under elevated O3 caused a 3% decrease in εi, the primary effect of O3 on biomass was through an 11% reduction in εc. When CO2 and O3 were elevated in combination, CO2 partially reduced the negative effects of elevated O3. Knowing that changes in productivity in elevated CO2 and O3 were influenced strongly by the efficiency of conversion of light energy into energy in plant biomass will aid in optimizing soybean yields in the future. Future modeling efforts that rely on εc for calculating regional and global plant productivity will need to accommodate the effects of global change on this important ecosystem attribute. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Crop; Leaf area index; Light; Photosynthesis; Production; SoyFACE","biomass; canopy; carbon dioxide; factor productivity; global change; leaf area index; light; ozone; photosynthesis; soybean; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949194180

A key signalling molecule produced in guard cells in response to plant hormones, light, carbon dioxide and pathogen-derived signals is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). The mechanisms by which H2O2 integrates multiple signals via specific signalling pathways leading to stomatal closure is not known. Principal Findings: Here, we identify a pathway by which H2O2, derived from endogenous and environmental stimuli, is sensed and transduced to effect stomatal closure. Histidine kinases (HK) are part of two-component signal transduction systems that act to integrate environmental stimuli into a cellular response via a phosphotransfer relay mechanism. There is little known about the function of the HK AHK5 in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we report that in addition to the predicted cytoplasmic localisation of this protein, AHK5 also appears to co-localise to the plasma membrane. Although AHK5 is expressed at low levels in guard cells, we identify a unique role for AHK5 in stomatal signalling. Arabidopsis mutants lacking AHK5 show reduced stomatal closure in response to H2O2, which is reversed by complementation with the wild type gene. Over-expression of AHK5 results in constitutively less stomatal closure. Abiotic stimuli that generate endogenous H2O2, such as darkness, nitric oxide and the phytohormone ethylene, also show reduced stomatal closure in the ahk5 mutants. However, ABA caused closure, dark adaptation induced H2O2 production and H2O2 induced NO synthesis in mutants. Treatment with the bacterial pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) flagellin, but not elf peptide, also exhibited reduced stomatal closure and H2O2 generation in ahk5 mutants. Significance: Our findings identify an integral signalling function for AHK5 that acts to integrate multiple signals via H2O2 homeostasis and is independent of ABA signalling in guard cells. © 2008 Desikan et al.",,"ethylene; flagellin; hydrogen peroxide; mutant protein; nitric oxide; phytohormone; protein AHK5; protein histidine kinase; abscisic acid; bacterial DNA; ethylene; ethylene derivative; nitric oxide; primer DNA; protein histidine kinase; protein kinase; protein-histidine kinase; T DNA; T-DNA; Arabidopsis; article; cell function; cell membrane; controlled study; cytoplasm; dark adaptation; environmental factor; gene overexpression; genetic complementation; guard cell; nonhuman; plant stoma; prediction; protein function; protein localization; signal transduction; wild type; Arabidopsis; cell fractionation; cytology; darkness; enzymology; gene; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; signal transduction; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Bacteria (microorganisms); Abscisic Acid; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Darkness; DNA Primers; DNA, Bacterial; Ethylenes; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Hydrogen Peroxide; Nitric Oxide; Protein Kinases; Signal Transduction; Subcellular Fractions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47749097140

Methodology was developed to semicontinuously measure subsurface concentrations of CO2 using expanded, porous Teflon (ePTFE) tubing. Lengths of ePTFE tubing (7.6 m) were buried at 0.02, 0.1, and 0.18 m below the soil surface in a Harps loam soil (fine-loamy, mixed, superactive, mesic Typic Calciaquoll) in central Iowa, and also positioned directly on the soil surface (0 m). Soil atmospheric gases that diffused through the walls of the tubing were circulated in a closed-loop design through solid-state CO2 sensors to determine the concentration of CO2 at each depth. Independent measures of CO2 concentrations were also determined by sampling the in-line gas stream of the ePTFE system and from samples extracted from gas wells positioned near the buried tubing. Good agreement (r2 &gt; 0.95) was observed between the ePTFE system and the independent measures, with the ePTFE having biases of 1.2 and 1.37 times greater than the in-line and gas well samples, respectively. The soil-gas diffusion coefficient of CO2 (Ds) was determined using intact soil cores and values were about 2.5 times less than two popular models used to predict Ds in soil. Estimates of CO2 flux using Fick's Law, six approaches to determine the vertical CO2 concentration gradient, and three methods to determine Ds ranged from &gt;800 to &lt;1 μmol m-2 s-1 on Day of the Year 239.5. Although Fick's Law is commonly used to estimate CO2 flux from soil, the approach used to determine the vertical CO2 concentration gradient and method used to determine Ds can both include sources of uncertainty. © Soil Science Society of America.

It is situated about 30km northeast of the city of Hannover and covers about 300km2. Six multilevel sampling wells along a representative strip under predominantly arable land along a groundwater flow-line were sampled from the groundwater table down to a depth of 10m below the soil surface. We measured N2O, CO2, NO3-, SO42-, DOC, pH, redox potentials and O2 concentrations. N2O accumulated at four out of six wells close to the groundwater table. About 20% of N2O that occurred between the groundwater table and 7-8m below it resided in the top 0.4m. An exchange zone for N2O at the interface between the saturated and the unsaturated zone extended 0.55 ± 0.22m below the groundwater table and acted as a source and sink for N2O. N2O below the exchange zone cannot be transferred from the groundwater to the atmosphere. The upward fluxes from the exchange zone into the unsaturated zone at the six wells ranged between 0.0009 and 0.3kg N2O ha- 1 year- 1. The yearly downward fluxes into the exchange zones had about the same order of magnitude as the upward fluxes. The upward and downward fluxes of N2O at the (fluctuating) water table did cancel out each other, but this does not yet imply, that the N2O fluxes at the soil surface also cancel out each other. N2O-N:NO3-N ratios were highly variable ranging from 0.0002 to 0.0417. A multiple regression for the monthly N2O amounts in the exchange zone could explain 66% of the yearly variation.

Americans spend most of their time indoors, where they have a greater ability to modify their environment. The indoor environment contains both pollutants (eg, particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, secondhand smoke, and ozone) and allergens from furred pets, dust mites, cockroaches, rodents, and molds. Indoor particulate matter consists of particles generated from indoor sources such as cooking and cleaning activities, and particles that penetrate from the outdoors. Nitrogen dioxide sources include gas stoves, furnaces, and fireplaces. Indoor particulate matter and nitrogen dioxide are linked to asthma morbidity. The indoor ozone concentration is mainly influenced by the outdoor ozone concentration. The health effects of indoor ozone exposure have not been well studied. In contrast, there is substantial evidence of detrimental health effects from secondhand smoke. Guideline recommendations are not specific for optimizing indoor air quality. The 2007 National Asthma Education and Prevention Program asthma guidelines recommend eliminating indoor smoking and improving the ventilation. Though the guidelines state that there is insufficient evidence to recommend air cleaners, air cleaners and reducing activities that generate indoor pollutants may be sound practical approaches for improving the health of individuals with asthma. The guidelines are more specific about allergen avoidance; they recommend identifying allergens to which the individual is immunoglobin E sensitized and employing a multifaceted, comprehensive strategy to reduce exposure. Outdoor air pollutants that impact asthma include particulate matter, ozone, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, and guidelines recommend that individuals with asthma avoid exertion outdoors when these pollutants are elevated. Outdoor allergens include tree, grass, and weed pollens, which vary in concentration by season. Recommendations to reduce exposure include staying indoors, keeping windows and doors closed, using air conditioning and perhaps high-efficiency particulate arrestor (HEPA) air filters, and thorough daily washing to remove allergens from one's person. © 2008 Daedalus Enterprises.","Allergens; Asthma; Nitrogen dioxide; Ozone; Particulate matter; Pollutants; Secondhand smoke; Sulfur dioxide","allergen; immunoglobulin E; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air conditioning; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; ambient air; asthma; avoidance behavior; cleaning; cockroach; concentration (parameters); conference paper; cooking; dust; environmental exposure; exercise; furnace; gas; grass; health education; health program; human; immune system; mite; morbidity; mould; nonhuman; particulate matter; passive smoking; pollen; practice guideline; rodent; season; smoke; sound; weed; air; animal; asthma; domestic animal; dust; fungus; immunology; indoor air pollution; particulate matter; Pyroglyphidae; review; Air; Air Pollution, Indoor; Allergens; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Asthma; Cockroaches; Dust; Environmental Exposure; Fungi; Humans; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Pyroglyphidae; Rodentia; Sulfur Dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50049109302

These communities serve to oxidize dissolved sulfides to sulfate, and are typically associated with the recent exposure of sulfide-rich sediments. Such mats are also ubiquitous in areas of hydrocarbon seepage, where they are thought to consume sulfide generated in underlying sediment. Despite the high abundance of dissolved methane in hydrocarbon seeps, few studies have considered the importance of methanotrophy in mat communities. To assess the importance of methanotrophs in microbial mats from hydrocarbon seeps, an approach involving lipid biomarkers, stable isotopes and enrichment culturing was applied. Microbial mat samples were collected from benthic surfaces at two hydrocarbon seeps located in the Coal Oil Point seep field, offshore from Goleta, California. Both samples display a high abundance of 16:1 fatty acids, including two isomers specific to type I methanotrophic bacteria, 16: 1(ω8) and 16:1(ω6). Depleted values of δ13C found in 16:1 fatty acids suggests methane assimilation into biomass, whereas three separate investigations of sulfide-oxidizing bacteria yield fractionation factors too small to account for these values. On the basis of these observations and experiments, an isotope mass balance was applied to fatty acids present in the microbial mat samples which indicates methanotrophs contribute up to 46% of total fatty acids. These results implicate methanotrophy as an important function for microbial mats in seep areas despite the visual appearance of these mats as being composed of giant sulfur bacteria.

In temperate regions of the world, coastal saltmarsh is mostly low-stature perennial grasses and herbs, whereas the tropical equivalent is woody vegetation that reaches shrub or tree height. The woody plants occupying the tropical intertidal mudflats are referred to as mangroves, and the plant community is commonly called a mangrove community, or more simply mangrove. Mangroves are the keystone species of a broader ecosystem that includes a number of additional plant taxa and animal species that are dependent on, but not necessarily exclusive to, the intertidal mangrove ecosystem. In addition to requiring adequate sedimentation for colonization, mangroves are limited by temperature and humidity, so that globally, they are found within the tropics and subtropics, with some incursions into lower latitudes of the temperate zones. Under optimal conditions of high and uniform precipitation and temperature, such as those found in equatorial regions, true forests develop with trees attaining heights of 50 m and above-ground biomass that is comparable with terrestrial lowland tropical forest. A general attenuation in plant size towards the latitudinal extremes of mangrove distributions is associated with increased seasonality of climate and reduced wet-season precipitation (Blasco 1984; Duke et al. 1998). At the extreme, these climate conditions may result in very low freshwater inputs, as is the case for the very arid-zone mangroves of the Arabian Gulf (Dodd et al. 1999). © Foundation for Environmental Conservation 2008.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84932602530

Al Gore's recent award, along with UN's Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) of the Nobel peace prize - provided a recent high profile linking of consumption and science. It is not clear to what extent the public at large engages in evaluating the scientific merits of the arguments about the link between human consumption and global environmental catastrophes. But on a local scale, we are routinely required to evaluate, scientific and pseudoscientific claims in advertising. Since advertising is used to sell products, the discourse of scientifically framed claims is being used to persuade consumers of the benefits of these products. In the case of functional foods and cosmetics, such statements are deployed to promote the health benefits and effectiveness of their products. This exploratory study examines the views of British consumers about the scientific and pseudoscientific claims made in advertisements for foods, with particular reference to functional foods, and cosmetics. The participants in the study all worked in scientific environments, though they were not all scientists. The study found that scientific arguments that were congruent with existing health knowledge tended to be accepted while pseudoscientific knowledge was regarded skeptically and concerns were raised over the accuracy and believability of the pseudoscientific claims. It appears that scientific awareness may play a part in consumers' ability to critically examine scientifically and pseudoscientifically based advertising claims. © SAGE Publications.",,"cosmetic; adult; advertizing; article; attitude to health; awareness; climate; consumer; female; food; greenhouse effect; human; information processing; interpersonal communication; middle aged; policy; safety; statistics; United Kingdom; Adult; Advertising as Topic; Awareness; Climate; Consumer Satisfaction; Cosmetics; Female; Focus Groups; Food; Great Britain; Greenhouse Effect; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Middle Aged; Public Policy; Safety; Truth Disclosure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40849139348

It is very important to estimate the quantity of water by using readily available climate data for managing water resources of the natural environment. As a case study an artificial neural network (ANN) methodology is developed for estimating the groundwater levels (upper Floridan aquifer levels) as a function of monthly averaged precipitation, evaporation, and measured levels of Magnolia and Brooklyn Lakes in north-central Florida. Groundwater and surface water are highly interactive in the region due to the characteristics of the geological structure, which consists of a sandy surficial aquifer, and a highly transmissive limestone-confined aquifer known as the Floridan aquifer system (FAS), which are separated by a leaky clayey confining unit. In a lake groundwater system that is typical of many karst lakes in Florida, a large part of the groundwater outflow occurs by means of vertical leakage through the underlying confining unit to a deeper highly transmissive upper Floridan aquifer. This provides a direct hydraulic connection between the lakes and the aquifer, which creates fast and dynamic surface water/groundwater interaction. Relationships among take levels, groundwater levels, rainfall, and evapotranspiration were determined using ANN-based models and multiple-linear regression (MLR) and multiple-nonlinear regression (MNLR) models. All the models were fitted to the monthly data series and their performances were compared. ANN-based models performed better than MLR and MNLR models in predicting groundwater levels.","Artificial neural network; Groundwater; Interaction; Surface water","Aquifers; Evapotranspiration; Groundwater; Lakes; Lime; Linear regression; Neural networks; Surface waters; Environmental concerns; Geological structures; Hydraulic connection; Interaction; Multiple linear regressions; Multiple nonlinear regression; Natural environments; Upper floridan aquifers; Groundwater resources; artificial neural network; confined aquifer; evapotranspiration; geological structure; groundwater flow; groundwater-surface water interaction; prediction; surface water; water level; water management; water quality; water resource; Brooklyn Lake; Florida [United States]; Magnolia Lake; North America; United States; Magnolia; Magnoliaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47249110634

A channel can allow for a reaction intermediate generated at one active site to be used as a substrate at a second active site, without the need for the intermediate to leave the safety of the protein matrix. One such bifunctional enzyme is carbon monoxide dehydrogenase/acetyl-CoA synthase from Moorella thermoacetica (mtCODH/ACS). A key player in the global carbon cycle, CODH/ACS uses a Ni-Fe-S center called the C-cluster to reduce carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide and uses a second Ni-Fe-S center, called the A-cluster, to assemble acetyl-CoA from a methyl group, coenzyme A, and C-cluster-generated CO. mtCODH/ACS has been proposed to contain one of the longest enzyme channels (138 Å long) to allow for intermolecular CO transport. Here, we report a 2.5 Å resolution structure of xenon-pressurized mtCODH/ACS and examine the nature of gaseous cavities within this enzyme. We find that the cavity calculation program CAVENV accurately predicts the channels connecting the C- and A-clusters, with 17 of 19 xenon binding sites within the predicted regions. Using this X-ray data, we analyze the amino acid composition surrounding the 19 Xe sites and consider how the protein fold is utilized to carve out such an impressive interior passageway. Finally, structural comparisons of Xe-pressurized mtCODH/ACS with related enzyme structures allow us to study channel design principles, as well as consider the conformational flexibility of an enzyme that contains a cavity through its center. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Amino acids; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Proteins; Xenon; Bifunctional enzymes; Multiple active sites; Enzyme activity; acetyl coenzyme A synthetase; acyl coenzyme A; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; iron; methyl group; nickel; sulfur; xenon; accuracy; amino acid composition; article; binding site; calculation; carbon cycle; chemical reaction; cluster analysis; comparative study; enzyme active site; enzyme conformation; enzyme structure; gas; Moorella thermoacetica; nonhuman; prediction; pressure; priority journal; protein folding; protein function; transport kinetics; Acetate-CoA Ligase; Aldehyde Oxidoreductases; Crystallization; Crystallography, X-Ray; Gram-Positive Asporogenous Rods, Irregular; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Multienzyme Complexes; Predictive Value of Tests; Protein Binding; Xenon; Moorella thermoacetica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40949131858

Two soil profiles on a small floodplain in southeastern Tennessee, USA were described and sampled in detail using both pedological and geological approaches, including stable carbon isotope analysis of soil organic matter (SOM). Correlation between the 2 profiles was constrained by uncalibrated AMS 14C ages of bulk humates, and using SOM δ13C values, both mobile and immobile elements. Four distinct 2.5-4‰ shifts towards less negative δ13C values for SOM suggest ∼ 300-yr cyclicity and transient warmer and drier climate events, with either water-stressed C3 vegetation or as much as 35% C4 plants present during the mid-Holocene.

Results from this study provide further understating regarding previous observations that the surface tensions of structure making sodium carbonate solutions have been shown to be significantly greater than the surface tensions of structure breaking bicarbonate solutions at equivalent concentrations. This difference in surface tension and its variation with salt concentration is related to the organization of water and ions at the air/solution interface. Spectral results from SFVS show at equivalent concentrations that, for the carbonate solution, the strong water structure signal of 3200 cm-1 at the air/carbonate solution interface is increased by a factor of 4 when compared to the same signal for the air/bicarbonate solution interface, which spectrum is weaker than the spectrum for the air/water interface in the absence of salt. These results from SFVS are explained by the results from MDS which show that in the case of carbonate solutions the structure making carbonate ions are excluded from the interfacial water region which region is extended in depth. On the other hand, in the case of bicarbonate solutions, the bicarbonate ions are accommodated in the interfacial water region and there is no evidence of an increase in the extent of water structure.

The results of many enclosure-based studies indicate that temporal SQT emission variations appear to be dominated mainly by ambient temperatures although other factors contribute (e.g., seasonal variations). This implies that SQT emissions have increased significance at certain times of the year, especially in late spring to mid-summer. The strong temperature dependency of SQT emissions also creates the distinct possibility of increasing SQT emissions in a warmer climate. Disturbances to vegetation (from herbivores and possibly violent weather events) are clearly also important in controlling short-term SQT emissions bursts, though the relative contribution of disturbance-induced emissions is not known. Based on the biogenic SQT emissions studies reviewed here, SQT emission rates among numerous species have been observed to cover a wide range of values, and exhibit substantial variability between individuals and across species, as well as at different environmental and phenological states. These emission rates span several orders of magnitude (10s&amp;ndash;1000s of ng gDW-1 h&amp;minus;1) . Many of the higher rates were reported by early SQT studies, which may have included artificially-elevated SQT emission rates due to higher-than-ambient enclosure temperatures and disturbances to enclosed vegetation prior to and during sample collection. When predicting landscape-level SQT fluxes, modelers must consider the numerous sources of variability driving observed SQT emissions. Characterizations of landscape and global SQT fluxes are highly uncertain given differences and uncertainties in experimental protocols and measurements, the high variability in observed emission rates from different species, the selection of species that have been studied so far, and ambiguities regarding controls over emissions. This underscores the need for standardized experimental protocols, better characterization of disturbance-induced emissions, screening of dominant plant species, and the collection of multiple replicates from several individuals within a given species or genus as well as a better understanding of seasonal dependencies of SQT emissions in order to improve the representation of SQT emission rates.",,"biogenic emission; landscape; phenology; seasonal variation; terpene; vegetation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43949090484

Compared with the stock suspension, the films show an initial photoluminescent shift, of circa 6-8 nm to the red, when the particles are deposited. A shift of circa 6-8 nm is also seen when the suspensions are first heated to 85°C from room temperature (20°C) having been stored in a fridge at 5°C. This shift is non-recoverable. With continual cycling from room temperature to 85°C the suspensions show a slight tendency for the emission to move increasingly to the red; whereas the films show no such tendency. In both cases, the range in emission is ca 10 nm from the room temperature state to 80°C. The intensity of the emission from the film drops abruptly (ca 50% reduction) after one cycle of heating; in the suspension there is an initial increase (ca 3-5% increase) in intensity before it decays. We see that the shift towards the red has been attributed to energy transfer or a rearrangement of the packing of the particles in the thin films. After conducting analysis of the films using scanning probe microscopy we have determined that a change in the morphology is responsible for the permanent shift in emission wavelength associated with prolonged heating. The influence of traps has not been ruled out, but the morphological change in the samples is very large and is likely to be the dominating mechanism affecting change for the red shift at room temperature.

This concept, which is basically different from the traditional one of inequality, is related to the level of inherent potential conflict in a distribution. The polarization approach has been widely applied in the analysis of income distribution. The extension of this approach to the analysis of international distribution of CO2 emissions is quite useful as it gives a potent informative instrument for characterizing the state and evolution of the international distribution of emissions and its possible political consequences in terms of tensions and the probability of achieving agreements. In this paper we analyze the international distribution of per capita CO2 emissions between 1971 and 2001 through the adaptation of the polarization concept and measures. We find that the most interesting grouped description deriving from the analysis is a two groups' one, which broadly coincide with Annex B and non-Annex B countries of the Kyoto Protocol, which shows the power of polarization analysis for explaining the generation of groups in the real world. The analysis also shows a significant reduction in international polarization in per capita CO2 emissions between 1971 and 1995, but not much change since 1995, which might indicate that polarized distribution of emission is still one of the important factors leading to difficulties in achieving agreements for reducing global emissions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Historically, diesel engines have been singled out in this regard, but recent research shows the need to consider particulate emissions from gasoline engines as well. Already implicated in more than one respiratory disease, the strongest evidence in recent times points to particle-mediated cardiovascular disorders (strokes and heart attacks). Accordingly, legislation limiting particulate emissions is becoming increasingly stringent, placing great pressure on the automotive industry to produce cleaner vehicles - pressure only heightened by the ever-increasing number of cars on our roads. Particulate Emissions from Vehicles addresses a field of increased international interest and research activity; discusses the impact of new legislation globally on the automotive industry; and explains new ways of measuring particle size, number and composition that are currently under development. The expert analysis and summary of the state-of-the-art, which encompasses the key areas of combustion performance, measurement techniques and toxicology, will appeal to R and D practitioners and engineers working in the automotive industry and related mechanical fields, as well as postgraduate students and researchers of engine technology, air pollution and life/ environmental science. The public health aspects will also appeal to the biomedical research community. © 2008 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890151491

One-hour averaged semi-continuous measurements were made with a suite of instruments to provide PM2.5 mass and chemical composition data. Total PM2.5 mass concentrations (non-volatile plus semi-volatile) were measured with an R&amp;P filter dynamic measurement system (FDMS TEOM) and a conventional TEOM monitor was used to measure non-volatile mass concentrations. PM2.5 chemical species monitors included a dual-oven Sunset monitor to measure both non-volatile and semi-volatile carbonaceous material, an ion chromatographic-based monitor to measure sulfate and nitrate and an Anderson Aethalometer to measure black carbon (BC). Gas phase data including CO, NO2, NOx and O3 were also collected during the sampling period. In addition, single-particle measurements were made using aerosol time-of-flight mass spectrometry (ATOFMS). Twenty different single-particle types consistent with those observed in previous ATOFMS studies in Riverside were identified for the PMF2 analysis. Finally, time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry (ToF-AMS) provided data on markers of primary and secondary organic aerosol. Two distinct PMF2 analyses were performed. In analysis 1, all the data except for the ATOFMS and ToF-AMS data were used in an initial evaluation of sources at Riverside during the study. PMF2 was able to identify six factors from the data set corresponding to both primary and secondary sources, primarily from automobile emissions, diesel emissions, secondary nitrate formation, a secondary photochemical associated source, organic emissions and Basin transported pollutants. In analysis 2, the ATOFMS and ToF-AMS data were included in the analysis. In the second analysis, PMF2 was able to identify 16 factors with a variety of both primary and secondary factors being identified, corresponding to both primary and secondary material from both anthropogenic and natural sources. Based on relationships with Basin meteorology, the PMF identified source profiles and diurnal patterns in the source concentrations, sources were identified as being of local origin or resulting from transport of pollutants across the Basin due to onshore flow. Good agreement was observed between the PMF2 predicted mass and the FDMS measured mass for both analyses. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we demonstrate that if RED credits were traded on international carbon markets, even moderate decreases in deforestation rates could generate billions of Euros annually for tropical forest conservation. We also discuss the main challenges for a RED mechanism that delivers real climatic benefits. These include providing sufficient incentives while only rewarding deforestation reductions beyond business-as-usual scenarios, addressing risks arising from forest degradation and international leakage, and ensuring permanence of emission reductions. Governance may become a formidable challenge for RED because some countries with the highest RED potentials score poorly on governance indices. In addition to climate mitigation, RED funds could help achieve substantial co-benefits for biodiversity conservation and human development. However, this will probably require targeted additional support because the highest biodiversity threats and human development needs may exist in countries that have limited income potentials from RED. In conclusion, how successfully a market-based RED mechanism can contribute to climate change mitigation, conservation and development will strongly depend on accompanying measures and carefully designed incentive structures involving governments, business, as well as the conservation and development communities. © 2008 The Royal Society.","Biodiversity; Carbon market; Climate change; Governance; Kyoto Protocol; Rainforest","biodiversity; climate change; compensation system; deforestation; emission control; forest management; governance approach; Kyoto Protocol; mitigation; rainforest; risk assessment",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41649115384

The global sourcing trends 2008 report is co-authored by Morrison & Foerster partners based in Europe, the USA and Asia and edited by the Chair of Morrison & Foerster's Global Sourcing Group. Initially, colleagues in the Global Sourcing Group were surveyed and this team of more than 60 lawyers in the firm's offices around the globe were asked for their observations over the last 12 months, and predictions for the coming months, based on advising on a wide range of sourcing projects in a number of geographic and sectoral markets. Soundings were taken from more than 50 clients from a client base which includes Fortune 100 companies, some of the world's largest financial institutions; public sector organizations; outsourcing service providers; and a range of corporates from diverse industry sectors including media, travel and logistics, insurance, healthcare and pharmaceuticals, and IT. Other advisors in the sector were spoken to also, including many of the leading outsourcing consultancies. Results of this informal survey were then compared with the annual sourcing reports the firm had produced at the start of 2006 and 2007. The report finds: an economic slowdown will see a move back towards cost-driven outsourcing – despite the fact that, over the long term, service-driven or value-driven deals tend to deliver more stable, successful relationships. Greater emphasis is seen on post-signature support, governance, supplier management, and the role of the retained function. As the pharma industry sharpens its focus on the core competencies needed to sustain its pipeline of new drug candidates, increased pharmaceutical outsourcing in 2008 and thereafter is expected to be seen. As all companies seek to reduce their corporate carbon footprint, a greater take up of outsourced services that deliver “Green IT” is expected.

Method and Materials: We investigate the impact of track structure on calculations of RBE values using the Local Effect Model (LEM). It calculates the RBE for cell lines or tissues starting from the corresponding experimental/clinical photon data and an amorphous track structure model. Different track structure models that use energy‐dependent as well as energy‐independent core radii are investigated and compared to in vitro and in vivo data. Additionally, we apply them to calculate the biologically effective dose along a spread‐out Bragg peak for typical chordoma treatments. Results: We show that the LEM is sensitive to different descriptions of the radial dose distributions. However, by changing a single model parameter of the photon reference curve, reasonable RBE values can be achieved for all dose distributions. The general improvement of predictions using a modified version of the LEM with an energy‐dependent core radius is demonstrated by comparison to in vitro data of human cell lines and to experimental data of the radiation tolerance of the rat spinal cord. Additionally, we find a larger therapeutic ratio for the modified model version relative to the original LEM for a typical treatment scenario for chordoma patients. Conclusion: The Local Effect Model is sensitive to the inner part (few nanometers) of different track structure descriptions. Since these interactions of ions with liquid water are neither well understood experimentally nor theoretically, more studies should address the energy deposition around ion tracks. This will be in particular useful for further optimization of carbon ion therapy in general and with respect to comparison with other treatment modalities like protons or IMRT. © 2008, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

The aim of the study was to determine whether the pre-construction opinions held by communities local to a wind farm change after an extended period following commissioning. Residents of St. Newlyn East, Cornwall, England, were asked to recall their opinions of Carland Cross wind farm in 1991 and 2006. Statistically significant changes in opinion were observed for attitudes regarding the wind farm's visual attractiveness and the importance of the energy security it provides. This study continues by exploring potential reasons for this in the context of recent literature on public attitudes towards renewable energy. The findings of this study support the proposals in the 2007 UK White Paper, Planning for a Sustainable Future, for community engagement early in the project process and for the requirement of infrastructure to be debated at the national level. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The hypothesis for this study was that the timing, frequency, and precipitation amount would produce different precipitation thresholds for uptake of carbon dioxide in grass and shrub plant communities. Eight years of precipitation data were used to determine the amount needed for carbon dioxide uptake thresholds in spring and summer seasons. Bowen ratio energy balance systems were used to measure carbon dioxide and moisture fluxes. In spring at the shrub site, close to or above long-term average spring precipitation of 59 mm was required to produce an uptake response. At the grass site a minimum of 23 mm was needed to produce an uptake response, which was much less than the long-term precipitation average of 68 mm. At both sites, spring or multiple summer responses reduced the threshold values for a summer response. Summer threshold ranges for the shrub site were 57-94 mm with a spring response and 123-140 mm without. Grass site summer thresholds were 51-95 mm with a spring response and 80-148 mm without. Summer precipitation threshold values were higher than spring values relating to the high summer evapotranspiration demand. The influence and variability of precipitation timing and frequency on carbon dioxide uptake threshold values resulted in no definitive conclusions as to differences between the grass and shrub plant communities, except that the grass site had slightly lower thresholds. Precipitation timing and frequency influence on total carbon uptake in some situations were more important than total precipitation. The lower grass site threshold values, along with a shift in climate toward more frequent and smaller precipitation events, may give grass ecosystems a competitive growth advantage.",,"Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Ecology; Plant life extension; Time measurement; Bowen ratio energy balance; Carbon uptake; Competitive growth; Driving forces; Moisture fluxes; Plant communities; Plant growth; Precipitation data; Precipitation events; Spring precipitation; Summer precipitation; Total carbon; Total precipitation; Springs (components); biological uptake; Bowen ratio; carbon dioxide; climate change; energy balance; evapotranspiration; grass; growth rate; plant community; precipitation assessment; semiarid region; shrub; threshold; Arizona; North America; United States; Walnut Gulch; Juglans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46049083207

In CASBEE, BEE (Building Environmental Efficiency) was developed as a new indicator for assessment following the concept of eco-efficlency. With the increasing BEE value, the total environmental performance of buildings is labeled from the highest performance. The framework of basic and extended CASBEE tools as a structured assessment system is called the ""CASBEE family."" CASBEE consists of a set of four basic assessment tools; namely, ""CASBEE for Pre-design"" (CASBEE-PD), ""CASBEE for New Construction"" (CASBEE-NC), ""CASBEE for Existing Building"" (CASBEE-EB) and ""CASBEE for Renovation"" (CASBEE-RN). These correspond to the individual stages of the building's lifecycle. There are also needs for detailed assessment targeting specific environmental aspects. ""CASBEE-HI,"" as an extended tool, assesses efforts made in buildings to alleviate the heat island effect. A new tool called ""CASBEE for Urban Development"" (CASBEE-UD) Is developed for assessment of a group of buildings. Some local authorities introduced CASBEE into their building administration as assessment methods for their sustainable building reporting systems. This requires building owners to submit a planning document assessing the environmental performance of their buildings to the authorities. In April 2004, the city of Nagoya introduced ""CASBEE Nagoya."" Introduction of CASBEE followed in the city of Osaka, Yokohama, Kyoto and other municipals. These local systems require some modification in CASBEE to reflect their local characteristics, such as climate and prioritized policies.

This has so far only been possible using indirect estimates of drug concentration such as assuming constant relation between tissue and blood including extrapolations from animals. Methods: A system for controlling target tissue concentration (UIPump) was used to regulate whole-brain concentrations of a central benzodiazepine receptor antagonist at therapeutic levels with input from brain kinetics as determined with PET. The system was tested by using pharmacological doses of flumazenil mixed with tracer amounts of [11C]flumazenil. Flumazenil was used as a model compound for anesthesia. An infusion scheme to produce three different steady-state levels in sequence was designed based on kinetic curves obtained after bolus injection. The subjects (Sprague-Dawley rats, n=6) were monitored in a microPET scanner during the whole experiment to verify resulting brain kinetic curves. Results: A steady-state brain concentration was rapidly achieved corresponding to a whole-brain concentration of 118±6 ng/ml. As the infusion rate decreased to lower the exposure by a factor of 2, the brain concentration decreased to 56±4 ng/ml. A third increased steady-state level of anesthesia corresponding to a whole-brain concentration of 107±7 ng/ml was rapidly achieved. Conclusion: The experimental setup with computerized pump infusion and PET supervision enables accurate setting of target tissue drug concentration. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

In 2002 and 2003, EPA revised its rules to narrow NSR's coverage of renovations. Congress mandated a National Research Council study of the revisions' impacts. In that study, we used an electricity-sector model to explore possible effects of the equipment replacement provision (ERP), the principal NSR change directed at power plants. We find that, assuming implementation of the Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR), tight enforcement of the prerevision NSR rules would likely lead to no or limited decreases in national emissions compared to policies such as ERP. However, emissions might shift forward in time because the previous NSR rules would depress allowance prices, discouraging banking and encouraging allowance use. Only under the most aggressive prerevision NSR enforcement scenario, in which essentially all coal capacity is compelled to retrofit controls by 2020, do NOx emissions fall below ERP levels. Even then, total 2007-2020 SO2 emissions are unaffected. Further decreases in national emissions could be accomplished more cheaply by tighter emissions caps than through NSR because caps provide incentives for efficient operating strategies, such as fuel switching, as well as retrofits. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Electric power generation; Fuels; Mathematical models; Retrofitting; Electricity-sector model; Equipment replacement provision (ERP); Particulate emissions; nitrous oxide; sulfur dioxide; coal; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; Electric power generation; Fuels; Mathematical models; Particulate emissions; Retrofitting; air quality; electricity generation; emission control; environmental legislation; law enforcement; legislative implementation; nitrogen oxides; sulfur dioxide; air monitoring; air sampling; article; atmospheric diffusion; atmospheric dispersion; electricity; health program; mandatory program; nitrous oxide emission; pollution control; pollution transport; air pollutant; air pollution; cost; economics; electric power plant; government; government regulation; legal aspect; theoretical model; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Coal; Costs and Cost Analysis; Electricity; Government Regulation; Models, Theoretical; Nitrogen Oxides; Power Plants; Sulfur Dioxide; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40949150783

Carbonyl compounds play a unique role in the development of our understanding of the spectroscopy, photochemistry, and photophysics of polyatomic molecules and their photodissociation has been the subject of numerous studies over many decades. Upon irradiation, a molecule can undergo internal conversion (IC) and intersystem crossing (ISC) processes, besides photochemical and other photophysical processes. Transient intermediates formed in the IC and ISC radiationless processes, which are termed ""dark"", are not amenable to detection by conventional light absorption or emission. However, these dark intermediates play critical roles in IC and ISC processes and thus are essential to understanding mechanistic photochemistry of a polyatomic molecule. We have applied the multiconfiguration complete active space selfconsistent field (CASSCF) method to determine the dark transient structures involved in radiationless processes for acetophenone and the related aromatic carbonyl compounds. The electronic and geometric structures predicted for the dark states are in a good agreement with those determined by ultrafast electron diffraction experiments. Intersection structure of different electronic states provides a very efficient ""funnel"" for the IC or ISC process. However, experimental determination of the intersection structure involved in radiationless transitions of a polyatomic molecule is impossible at present. We have discovered a minimum energy crossing point among the three potential energy surfaces (S1, T1, and T2) that appears to be common to a wide variety of aromatic carbonyl compounds with a constant structure. This new type of crossing point holds the key to understanding much about radiationless processes after photoexcitation of aromatic carbonyl compounds. The importance of ab initio determination of transient structures in the photodissociation dynamics has been demonstrated for the case of the aromatic carbonyl compounds. In addition, the detailed knowledge of mechanistic photochemistry for aromatic carbonyl compounds forms the basis for further investigating photodissociation dynamics of a polyatomic molecule.

The bottleneck of implementing the strategies is the capacity of predicting the simultaneous impacts of change in management practices on agricultural production, soil and water resources and environmental safety. Process-based models provide an opportunity to quantify the impacts of farm management options on various pools and fluxes of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in agroecosystems. The denitrification-decomposition or DNDC model was recently modified for simulating N cycling for the U.S. Midwestern agricultural systems. This paper reports a continuous effort on applying the model for estimating the impacts of alternative management practices (e.g., no-till, cover crop, change in fertilizer rate or timing) on agro-ecosystems in the Midwestern U.S. A typical row-crop field in Iowa was selected for the sensitivity tests. The modeled results were assessed with a focus on four major indicators of agro-ecosystems, namely crop yield, soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration, nitrate-N leaching loss and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. The results indicated that no-till practice significantly increased SOC storage and reduced nitrate-N leaching rate, but slightly decreased crop yield and increased N2O emissions. By modifying the methods of fertilizer application in conjunction with the no-till practice, the disadvantages of no-till could be overcome. For example, increasing the fertilizing depth and using a nitrification inhibitor could substantially reduce N2O emissions and increase crop yield under the no-till conditions. This study revealed the complexity of impacts of the alternative farming management practices across different climate conditions, soil properties and management regimes. Process-based models can play an important role in quantifying the comprehensive effects of management alternatives on agricultural production and the environment. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Since isoprenoid biosynthesis requires high amounts of phosphorylated intermediates, the emission may also be controlled by inorganic phosphorus concentration (Pi) in leaves. We carried out experiments to determine the emission of isoprene from Phragmites australis plants used in reconstructed wetlands to phytoremediate elevated levels of phosphorus contributed by urban wastes. Four groups of plants were grown hydroponically in water containing different levels of KH2PO 4. High levels of phosphorus in the water resulted in high Pi in the leaves. High Pi stimulated photosynthesis at intercellular CO2 concentrations lower and higher than ambient, implying higher ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase (Rubisco) activity and higher ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate regeneration rates, respectively. However, isoprene emission was substantially lower at high Pi than at low Pi, and was not associated to photosynthesis rates at high Pi. This surprising result suggests that isoprene is limited by processes other than photosynthetic intermediate availability or by energetic (ATP) requirements under high Pi levels. Irrespective of the mechanism responsible for the observed reduction of isoprene emission, our results show that Phragmites plants may effectively remove phosphorus from water without concurrently increase isoprene emission, at least on a leaf area basis. Thus, Phragmites used in reconstructed wetlands for phytoremediation of urban wastes rich of phosphates will not contribute high loads of hydrocarbons which may influence air quality over urban and peri-urban areas. © 2007 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Isoprene emission; Phosphorus; Phragmites australis; Phytoremediation","aquatic plant; biogenic emission; experimental study; grass; hydroponics; isoprene; metabolism; phosphorus; photosynthesis; phytoremediation; urban area; wetland; Phragmites; Phragmites australis; 1,3 butadiene derivative; hemiterpene; isoprene; pentane; phosphorus; article; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Poaceae; soil; Butadienes; Hemiterpenes; Pentanes; Phosphorus; Poaceae; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41649115088

Consequently there is now growing confidence that these changes are largely attributable to global warming. Based on the data from four long-term monitoring, synoptic stations, between 1890 and 2004, mean annual temperatures in Ireland rose by 0.7°C. In the absence of strict emissions controls, a doubling of global atmospheric concentrations of CO2 is likely by the end of the twenty-first century. As a consequence, global temperatures are projected to increase by between 1.8°C and 4°C over the same period depending on the climate sensitivity to increased levels of greenhouse gases. In order to determine the likely impact on Irish temperatures and related climatic variables, this paper illustrates a technique for downscaling Global Climate Model (GCM) output for a selection of sites in Ireland. Results of a weighted ensemble mean, derived from multiple GCMs, are presented in an attempt to address some of the various uncertainties inherent in climate modelling. Projected changes in selected indices of temperature extremes are also presented for a high emissions scenario (A2), as changes in extremes are likely to have a larger and more immediate impact on human society than changes in the mean climate state. © 2008 Geographical Society of Ireland.","Ireland; Potential evapotranspiration; Radiation; Statistical downscaling; Temperature","climate change; climate modeling; downscaling; electromagnetic radiation; ensemble forecasting; global climate; potential evapotranspiration; statistical analysis; temperature; Eurasia; Europe; Ireland; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949130824

This quality makes them a tool of choice for the preparation of perovskite-type oxides. To optimize the functional properties of these materials, it is essential to set accurately their possible complex stoichiometries. However, details of the formation of the perovskite crystal remain obscure. Different stages of an ethylene-diamine-tetraacetic acid (EDTA)/citrate-gel based synthesis process for mixed conducting (Ba0.5Sr0.5)(Fe0.8Zn0.2)O3-δ of cubic perovskite structure are elucidated. The combination of analytical transmission electron microscopy with X-ray diffraction reveals that the perovskite-type oxide is formed already at moderate temperatures at around 700 °C via nanoscale solid state reactions between finely-dispersed crystalline intermediates identified as a spinel and a carbonate. The reaction scheme, however, is intricate and includes stuffed tridymite structures as transient phases. The ultrafine intermixing of extremely small reactants makes EDTA/citrate-gel based procedures superior to classical solid state routes with respect to applications that demand phase purity and stoichiometry control. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

In this study, we have used both RNA antisense and gene knockout lines to specifically reduce the activity of the chloroplast βCA1 polypeptide (At3g01500) in the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Although able to germinate, seedling establishment of transgenic plants is significantly reduced relative to wild-type plants when grown at ambient levels of CO2. Growth at elevated (1,500 μL L-1) CO2 or on plates supplemented with sucrose restores seedling establishment rates to wild-type levels. Seed from wild-type and transgenic plants exhibited no significant differences in seed protein, lipid content, or reserve mobilization during seedling growth. βCA1-deficient seedlings do, however, exhibit reduced capacity for light-dependent 14CO2 assimilation prior to the development of true leaves. The small number of surviving seedlings able to grow and develop are phenotypically similar to wild-type plants, even when subsequently grown at subambient levels of CO2. Microarray analysis of mature leaves of βCA1-deficient plants shows some differences in transcript abundance, particularly with genes involved in ethylene signaling and response. The data suggest that reduced levels of seedling establishment by βCA1-deficient plants could be the result of poor cotyledon photosynthetic performance at the onset of phototrophic growth and prior to the development of true leaves. © 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.",,"Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Embryophyta; carbonate dehydratase; primer DNA; Arabidopsis; article; enzymology; growth, development and aging; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; plastid; Arabidopsis; Base Sequence; Carbonic Anhydrases; DNA Primers; Plastids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48549098844

Mechanical layering is a fundamental control on carbonate fault zones. Relatively planar faults with low-displacement gradients develop in massive, strong, clay-poor limestones and dolomites. In less competent clay-rich strata, shale beds impede fault propagation, resulting in fault-related folding, and locally steep bedding dips. Faults in clay-poor massive limestones and dolomites tend to be steep (70° or more), whereas weaker, clay-rich limestones develop faults with shallower dips (60° or less). Fault zone rocks show evidence of cataclasis, cementation, deformation of cement by mechanical twinning and pressure solution, and multiple generations of cement with differing degrees of deformation, indicating contemporaneous cementation and fault slip. In stratigraphic sequences consisting of both competent and incompetent strata, the ratio of incompetent to competent strata by thickness is a useful guide for inferring the relative rates of fault displacement and propagation. Low displacement-to-propagation ratios associated with competent strata generate low-displacement gradients, inhibiting fault-related folding. Conversely, high displacement-to-propagation ratios associated with incompetent strata promote high-displacement gradients and fault-related folding. Copyright © 2008.

Therefore, it is critical to develop technologies to mitigate this problem. One very promising approach to reducing CO2 emissions is CO2 capture at a power plant, transport to an injection site, and sequestration for long-term storage in any of a variety of suitable geologic formations. However, if the promise of this approach is to come to fruition, capture costs will have to be reduced. The Department of Energy's Carbon Sequestration Program is actively pursuing this goal. CO2 capture from coal-derived power generation can be achieved by various approaches: post-combustion capture, pre-combustion capture, and oxy-combustion. All three of these pathways are under investigation, some at an early stage of development. A wide variety of separation techniques is being pursued, including gas phase separation, absorption into a liquid, and adsorption on a solid, as well as hybrid processes, such as adsorption/membrane systems. Current efforts cover not only improvements to state-of-the-art technologies but also development of several innovative concepts, such as metal organic frameworks, ionic liquids, and enzyme-based systems.

The most abundant secondary species include sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). The relative abundance of each species varies in space and time as a function of meteorology, source emissions strength and type, thermodynamics, and atmospheric processing. Transport of secondary aerosols from upwind locations can contribute significantly at downwind receptor sites, especially regionally in the eastern United States, and across a given urbanized area, such as in Los Angeles. Processes governing the formation of the inorganic secondary species (sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium) are fairly well understood, although the occurrence of nucleation bursts initiated with the formation of ultrafine sulfuric acid particles observed regionally on clean days in the eastern United States was unexpected. Because of the complex nature of organic material in air, much is still to be learned about the sources, formation, and even spatial and temporal distributions of SOAs. For example, a considerable fraction of ambient organic PM is oxidized organic species, many of which still need to be identified, quantified, and their sources and formation mechanisms determined. Furthermore, significant uncertainty (approaching 50% or more) is associated with estimating the SOA fraction of organic material in air with current methods. This review summarizes the findings of the Supersites Program and related studies addressing secondary particulate matter (PM), including spatial and temporal variations of secondary PM and its precursor species, data and methods for determining the primary and secondary fractions of PM mass, and findings on the anthropogenic and natural fractions of secondary PM.

In many areas, thinning treatments can re-establish the natural ecological processes and help restore ecosystem structure and function. Precipitous global climate change has focused attention on the carbon storage in forests. An unintended consequence of fire suppression has been the increased storage of carbon in ponderosa stands. Thinning treatments reduce standing carbon stocks while releasing carbon through the combustion of fuel in logging machinery, burning slash, and the decay of logging slash and wood products. These reductions and releases of stored carbon must be compared to the risk of catastrophic fire burning through the stand and releasing large quantities of carbon to the atmosphere to more fully understand the costs and benefits - in carbon terms - of forest restoration strategies. This study examines the effect of a restoration thinning treatment on the carbon stock of a ponderosa pine forest. The total pre-treatment above-ground carbon stock was 48,880 kg C ha-1 and the post-treatment stand had 36,420 kg C ha-1. The carbon stock in trees across the stand ranged from 28,560 to 67,560 kg C ha-1 pre-treatment and from 11,970 to 55,510 kg C ha-1 post-treatment. 8240 kg C ha-1 was removed from the site and sold to the wholesale firewood market (plot values ranged from 4890 to 12,310 kg C ha-1), 91 kg C ha-1 was released from the combustion of fuel in harvesting operations and trucking, and the processing of the firewood required carbon released 33 kg C ha-1. The burning of slash piled on site released 4140 kg C ha-1 (plot values ranged from 2920 to 6900 kg C ha-1). We estimated that in a stand-replacing fire, the treated stand would release 2410 kg C ha-1 less to the atmosphere than the untreated stand. However, the thinning treatment resulted in stand structural changes that make the stand less likely to support a crown fire and therefore more likely to avoid the carbon releases associated with crown fires, even under extreme fire conditions. On balance, the thinning treatment released 3114 kg C ha-1. If the wood removed from the site had been used in longer-lasting products, the thinning could have resulted in net carbon storage on the order of 3351 kg C ha-1. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, MERIS can be up to 100% apart from MODIS and SeaWiFS. This difference reduces to about 35% if MERIS is calibrated with the ENEA lidar. Those results confirm the unavoidable need of precise measurements of chlorophyll-a concentration in close proximity to the sea surface.

With multidecadal full-chemistry transient simulations in the MOZART-2 tropospheric chemistry model, we show that tropospheric O3 responds approximately linearly to changes in CH4 emissions over a range of anthropogenic emissions from 0-430 Tg CH4 a-1 (0.11-0.16 Tg tropospheric O3 or ∼11-15 ppt global mean surface O3 decrease per Tg a-1 CH4 reduced). We find that neither the air quality nor climate benefits depend strongly on the location of the CH4 emission reductions, implying that the lowest cost emission controls can be targeted. With a series of future (2005-2030) transient simulations, we demonstrate that cost-effective CH4 controls would offset the positive climate forcing from CH4 and O3 that would otherwise occur (from increases in NOx and CH4 emissions in the baseline scenario) and improve O3 air quality. We estimate that anthropogenic CH4 contributes 0.7 Wm-2 to climate forcing and ∼4 ppb to surface O3 in 2030 under the baseline scenario. Although the response of surface O3 to CH4 is relatively uniform spatially compared to that from other O3 precursors, it is strongest in regions where surface air mixes frequently with the free troposphere and where the local O3 formation regime is NOx-saturated. In the model, CH4 oxidation within the boundary layer (below ∼2.5 km) contributes more to surface O3 than CH4 oxidation in the free troposphere. In NOx-saturated regions, the surface O3 sensitivity to CH4 can be twice that of the global mean, with >70% of this sensitivity resulting from boundary layer oxidation of CH4. Accurately representing the NOx distribution is thus crucial for quantifying the O3 sensitivity to CH4.

Due to knowledge spillovers, optimal policy involves a portfolio of different instruments targeted at emissions, learning, and R&D. Although the relative cost of individual policies in achieving reductions depends on parameter values and the emissions target, in a numerical application to the U.S. electricity sector, the ranking is roughly as follows: (1) emissions price, (2) emissions performance standard, (3) fossil power tax, (4) renewables share requirement, (5) renewables subsidy, and (6) R&D subsidy.

Operationally generated data sets consist of temperature, H2O, O3, CH4, N2O, HNO3, and NO2 profiles. Measurement errors are investigated in detail and random and systematic errors are specified. The results are validated by independent instrumentation which has been operated at ground stations or aboard balloon gondolas and aircraft. Intercomparisons of MIPAS measurements with other satellite data have been carried out, too. As a result, it has been proven that the MIPAS data are of good quality. MIPAS can be operated in different measurement modes in order to optimize the scientific output. Due to the wealth of information in the MIPAS spectra, many scientific results have already been published. They include intercomparisons of temperature distributions with ECMWF data, the derivation of the whole NOy family, the study of atmospheric processes during the Antarctic vortex split in September∼2002, the determination of properties of Polar Stratospheric Clouds, the downward transport of NOx in the middle atmosphere, the stratosphere- troposphere exchange, the influence of solar variability on the middle atmosphere, and the observation of Non-LTE effects in the mesosphere.",,"atmospheric chemistry; data set; Envisat-1; error analysis; FTIR spectroscopy; interferometer; polar stratospheric cloud; satellite data; troposphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42249099156

The Priestley-Taylor model is relatively simple, and has proven to be remarkably accurate and theoretically robust for estimates of potential evapotranspiration. Building on recent advances in ecophysiological theory that allow detection of multiple stresses on plant function using biophysical remote sensing metrics, we developed a bio-meteorological approach for translating Priestley-Taylor estimates of potential evapotranspiration into rates of actual evapotranspiration. Five model inputs are required: net radiation (Rn), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI), maximum air temperature (Tmax), and water vapor pressure (ea). Our model requires no calibration, tuning or spin-ups. The model is tested and validated against eddy covariance measurements (FLUXNET) from a wide range of climates and plant functional types-grassland, crop, and deciduous broadleaf, evergreen broadleaf, and evergreen needleleaf forests. The model-to-measurement r2 was 0.90 (RMS = 16 mm/month or 28%) for all 16 FLUXNET sites across 2 years (most recent data release). Global estimates of evapotranspiration at a temporal resolution of monthly and a spatial resolution of 1° during the years 1986-1993 were determined using globally consistent datasets from the International Satellite Land-Surface Climatology Project, Initiative II (ISLSCP-II) and the Advanced Very High Resolution Spectroradiometer (AVHRR). Our model resulted in improved prediction of evapotranspiration across water-limited sites, and showed spatial and temporal differences in evapotranspiration globally, regionally and latitudinally. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Forecasts based on bioclimatic envelop modeling of distributions of species suggests greater impacts can be expected in the future, but such projections are contingent on assumptions regarding future climate and migration rates of species. Here, we present a first assessment of the potential impact of climate change on a global biodiversity hotspot in southwestern Western Australia. Across three representative scenarios of future climate change, we simulated migration of 100 Banksia (Proteaceae) species at a rate of 5 km decade-1 and compared projected impacts with those under the commonly applied, but acknowledged as inadequate, assumptions of 'full-' and 'no-migration.' Across all climate × migration scenarios, 66% of species were projected to decline, whereas only 6% were projected to expand or remain stable. Between 5% and 25% of species were projected to suffer range losses of 100% by 2080, depending mainly on climate scenario. Species losses were driven primarily by changes in current precipitation regimes, with the greatest losses of species projected to occur in a transition zone between wet coastal areas and interior arid regions and which is projected to become more arid in the future. Because the ranges of most species tended to collapse in all climate scenarios, we found that climate change impacts to flora of southwestern Western Australia may be large, even under optimistic assumptions regarding migration abilities. Taken together, our results suggest that the future of biodiversity in southwestern Western Australia may lie largely in the degree to which this hotspot experiences increased drought and in the ability of species to tolerate such decreases in precipitation. More broadly, our study is among a growing number of theoretical studies suggesting the impacts of future climate change on global biodiversity may be considerable. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Bioclimatic; Dispersal; Ecologic alniche; Endemic; Extinction; Maxent; Maximum entropy; Niche-based model; Range shift; Species distribution model","bioclimatology; biodiversity; climate change; climate effect; dispersal; endemic species; evergreen tree; extinction; geographical distribution; hot spot; maximum entropy analysis; migration; range expansion; Australasia; Australia; Western Australia; Banksia; Proteaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43349092796

It is argued that demographers have consistently underestimated the impact of such improvements and, consequently, have underestimated gains in life expectancy. With more workers living longer and healthier lives, men in Western countries have four times more leisure than they did a century ago, and this trend will continue.

Although this technology has proven effective for various temperate soils, extrapolation to cold soils is hindered by the lack of information about specific microbes, genes, and enzymes involved in hydrocarbon biodegradation in cold soils. These environments present multiple challenges to bioremediation besides low temperature and concomitantly lower enzymatic reaction rates: for example, cold soils are often poor in nutrients, low in available water, and may exhibit extremes of pH and salinity. Also in such environments the physical nature of the contaminant(s) is affected, with increased viscosity of liquid hydrocarbons and reduced volatilization of toxic, low molecular weight hydrocarbons. Despite these constraints, the biodegradation of many of the components of petroleum hydrocarbons by indigenous cold-adapted microbial populations has been observed at low temperatures in hydrocarbon-contaminated soils (e.g. Braddock et al.1997; Aislabie et al.1998; Margesin and Schinner 1998; Whyte et al 1999a; Mohn and Stewart 2000). However, because hydrocarbons tend to persist in polar soils, there are obvious limitations to the activity of the indigenous microbes in situ.In this chapter we review the literature describing hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria indigenous to cold soils, with a focus on polar soils. We discuss their adaptations to environmental parameters that challenge their activity in situ including cold and fluctuating temperatures, limited nutrient availability, extremes in pH and salinity, and desiccation. We provide recommendations for methods to determine whether a soil contains the appropriate microbial community for applying bioremediation. © Cambridge University Press 2008 and 2009.",,"Aluminum alloys; Bacteria; Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Contamination; Hydrocarbons; Microorganisms; Nutrients; Petroleum chemistry; Pollution; Reaction rates; Soils; Environmental parameter; Fluctuating temperatures; Hydrocarbon biodegradation; Hydrocarbon degrading bacteria; Microbial communities; Microbial populations; Nutrient availability; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Soil pollution",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76149134741

The determination of the temperature and mixture field occurs by employing in-flame measurement techniques. Valuable information concerning the mixing procedure, the temperature distribution, the turbulence level, and the velocity field of the flame is provided. The results demonstrate that there is sufficient residence time in the precombustion area of the lifted flame in order to achieve spatial and temporal uniformity of the mixture, leading to a quasi-premixed state. It was also found that hot reaction products, carried upstream by an annular zone of reverse flow, react with fresh unburnt mixture in a re-ignition process. The determination of the flow pattern revealed the presence of an inner weak recirculation zone in the nozzle vicinity and a dominant external recirculation zone. The examination of the probability density function of the velocity measurements was also found to be a very useful tool in terms of the analysis of the turbulence structure of the flow. The bimodal distribution in the shear layer between the downstream flow and the recirculated gases yields the existence of large scale eddies.

Arsenic sources in the Penobscot Formation include, in order of decreasing As content by weight: löllingite and realgar (c. 70%), arsenopyrite, cobaltite, glaucodot, and gersdorffite (in the range of 34-45%), arsenian pyrite (<4%), and pyrrhotite (<0.15%). In the Penobscot Formation, the relative stability of primary As-bearing minerals follows a pattern where the most commonly observed highly altered minerals are pyrrhotite, realgar, niccolite, löllingite > glaucodot, arsenopyrite-cobaltian > arsenopyrite, cobaltite, gersdorffite, fine-grained pyrite, Ni-pyrite > coarse-grained pyrite. Reactions illustrate that oxidation of Fe-As disulphide group and As-sulphide minerals is the primary release process for As. Liberation of As by carbonation of realgar and orpiment in contact with high-pH groundwaters may contribute locally to elevated contents of As in groundwater, especially where As is decoupled from Fe. Released metals are sequestered in secondary minerals by sorption or by incorporation in crystal structures. Secondary minerals acting as intermediate As reservoirs include claudetite (c. 75%), orpiment (61%), scorodite (c. 450%), secondary arsenopyrite (c. 469/6), goethite (<4490 ppm), natrojarosite (<42 ppm), rosenite, melanterite, ferrihydrite, and Mn-hydroxide coatings. Some soils also contain Fe-Co-Ni-arsenate, Ca-arsenate, and carbonate minerals. Reductive dissolution of Fe-oxide minerals may govern the ultimate release of iron and arsenic - especially As(V) - to groundwater; however, dissolution of claudetite (arsenic trioxide) may directly contribute As(III). Processes thought to explain the release of As from minerals in bedrock include oxidation of arsenian pyrite or arsenopyrite, or carbonation of As-sulphides, and most models based on these generally rely on discrete minerals or on a fairly limited series of minerals. In contrast, in the Penobscot Formation and other metasedimentary rocks of coastal Maine, oxidation of As-bearing Fe-cobalt-nickel-sulphide minerals, dissolution (by reduction) of As-bearing secondary As and Fe hydroxide and sulphate minerals, carbonation and/or oxidation of As-sulphide minerals, and desorption of As from Fe-hydroxide mineral surfaces are all thought to be involved. All of these processes contribute to the occurrence of As in groundwaters in coastal Maine, as a result of variability in composition and in stability of the As source minerals. Arsenic contents of soils and groundwater thus reflect the predominant influence and integration of a spectrum of primary mineral reservoirs (instead of single or unique mineral reservoirs). Cycling of As through metasedimentary bedrock aquifers may therefore depend on consecutive stages of carbonation, oxidation and reductive dissolution of primary and secondary As host minerals. © 2008 AAG/ Geological Society of London.","Arsenic; Maine; Mineralogy; Pathways; Reactions; Trace-element chemistry; Watershed","Aquifers; Arsenic; Carbonation; Cobalt compounds; Dissolution; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Iron oxides; Manganese compounds; Mineralogy; Nickel compounds; Oxidation; Oxide minerals; Pyrites; Rare earths; Sulfur compounds; Surface waters; Trace elements; Underground reservoirs; Watersheds; Element chemistry; Maine; Metasedimentary rocks; Pathways; Reactions; Reductive dissolution; Relative stabilities; Transport pathways; Arsenate minerals; arsenic; bedrock; conference proceeding; crystal structure; dissolution; groundwater; iron oxide; metasedimentary rock; mineralogy; pyrite; secondary mineral; surface water; trace element; transport process; watershed; Maine; North America; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39649119499

Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are considered as one promising technological solution for limiting transport-generated greenhouse gas emissions. Currently, the number of HEVs in the market remains limited, but this picture will change in the years to come as HEVs are expected to pave the way for cleaner technologies in transport. In this paper, results are presented regarding fuel economy and pollutant emissions measurements of two hybrid electric production vehicles. The measurements were conducted on a Prius II and a Honda Civic IMA using both the European legislated driving cycle (New European Driving Cycle, NEDC) and real-world simulation driving cycles (Artemis). In addition to the emissions measurements, other vehicle-operating parameters were studied in an effort to better quantify the maximum CO2 reduction potential. Data from real-world operation of a Prius II vehicle were also used in the evaluation. Results indicate that in most cases both vehicles present improved energy efficiency and pollutant emissions compared to conventional cars. The fuel economy benefit of the two HEVs peaked under urban driving conditions where reductions of 60% and 40% were observed, respectively. Over higher speeds the difference in fuel economy was lower, reaching that of conventional diesel at 95 km h-1. The effect of ambient temperature on fuel consumption was also quantified. It is concluded that urban operation benefits the most of hybrid technology, leading to important fuel savings and urban air quality improvement. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

With the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and a variety of recently introduced national directives supporting renewable energy sources in the European Union, the economic attractiveness of bioenergy production has distinctly increased. This article combines an economic evaluation of biomass production with site-related natural conditions of the Havelland region, situated in the north-east area of Germany. Two methods for evaluating site-specific potential biomass yields were compared. For three example biomass crops, evaluations of yield estimations at agricultural lots for site-optimized suitability (SOS) and conventional suitability (CS) were carried out. Both modelling approaches were compared. The results of the GIS modelling indicate that the financial support for increasing the use of renewable energy with the German feed-in system, called Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz (EEG), will possibly lead to an increased cultivation of crops with high biomass output. This monocultural orientation of farming practices and the negative effects on the ecosystem could act in opposition to other environmental initiatives of the EU. The outputs of the SOS analysis show that high biomass production could be integrated into environmental policy proposals. Therefore, new EU policy should take modified subsidies into consideration in order to avoid developing conflicts between small-scale changes in landscape ecosystems caused by large-scale transformations in energy policy. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Biomass; Common Agricultural Policy (CAP); Erneuerbares- Energien-Gesetz (EEG); GIS-modelling","Bioenergy; Common Agricultural Policy (CAP); Erneuerbares- Energien-Gesetz (EEG); Greenhouse gas emissions; Ecosystems; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Sustainable development; Biomass; agricultural policy; biomass allocation; economic analysis; energy policy; European Union; GIS; greenhouse gas; land use; modeling; renewable resource; sustainability; agricultural management; article; biomass; economic aspect; energy; financial management; Germany; land use; policy; Biomass; Conservation of Energy Resources; Costs and Cost Analysis; Crops, Agricultural; Energy-Generating Resources; European Union; Geographic Information Systems; Germany; Models, Theoretical; Brandenburg; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany; Havelland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549111982

Multibeam bathymetry, side scan sonar imagery and 2D seismics are analyzed to present four mound provinces: (1) the Pen Duick Mound Province on the Pen Duick Escarpment, (2) the Renard Mound Province on the Renard Ridge, (3) the Vernadsky Mound Province on the Vernadsky Ridge and the Al Idrisi Mound Province on the gas-blanked sediments above the buried Al Idrisi Ridge. Video imagery and surface samples are described to ground-truth the different mound areas. The paradox is that nearly no live corals are presently being observed at the surface of the mounds, while the mound cores display throughout a high number of reef-forming cold-water coral fragments (scleractinians) in association with numerous associated fauna formerly inhabiting the econiches provided by the coral framework. Environmental and oceanographic conditions during the recent past (glacials/stadials) were probably more favourable for cold-water coral growth. Pore water analyses in on-mound cores at the south-eastern edge of Pen Duick Escarpment give evidence of focused, higher methane fluxes and sulphate reduction rates on mounds than in the surrounding sediments. Cores from several mounds display horizons of strong corrosion and dissolution of the coral fragments. A three-phase model for carbonate mound evolution in these settings is proposed. (1) In a first stage external controls (positive oceanographic and environmental conditions, the presence of an active planktonic food chain, based on a high primary production, and a suitable substrate) are responsible for the initiation of cold-water coral growth. (2) Once the cold-water corals established an initial framework, sedimentation becomes an important factor controlling mound growth: the cold-water corals baffle the sediments. (3) Throughout mound growth, the mound may episodically be affected by diagenetic processes responsible for aragonite dissolution and probably carbonate precipitation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Low Isles Reef is one of 46 low wooded island-reefs unique to the northern Great Barrier Reef, which are situated in areas that lie in reach of river flood plumes and where inter-reef sediments are dominated by terrigenous mud. Radiocarbon ages from surface and subsurface sediment samples indicate that Low Isles Reef began to form at ca 3000 y BP, several thousand years after the Holocene sea-level stillstand, and reached sea-level soon after (within ∼500 years). Maximum reef productivity, marked by the development of mature reef flats that contributed sediment to a central lagoon, was restricted to a narrow window of time, between 3000 and 2000 y BP. This interval corresponds to: (i) a fall in relative sea-level, from ∼1 m above present at ca 5500 y BP to the current datum between 3000 and 2000 y BP; and (ii) a regional climate transition from pluvial (wetter) to the more arid conditions of today. The most recent stage of development (ca 2000-0 y BP) is characterised by extremely low rates of carbonate production and a dominance of destructive reef processes, namely storm-driven remobilisation of reef-top sediments and transport of broken coral debris from the reef front and margins to the reef top. Results of the present study enhance existing models of reef development for the Great Barrier Reef that are based on regional variations in reef-surface morphology and highlight the role of climate in controlling the timing and regional distribution of carbonate production in this classic mixed carbonate-siliciclastic environment.","Australia; Carbonate sediments; Great Barrier Reef; Holocene; Queensland","barrier reef; carbonate sediment; coral reef; deposition; Holocene; modeling; reef formation; Australasia; Australia; Coral Sea; Great Barrier Reef; Low Isles Reef; Pacific Ocean; Queensland; Anthozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45949102597

Biogas concentration measurements and gas-pumping tests were conducted in multilevel wells installed in the backfilled overburden beside the landfill site. A migration event recorded in autumn 2004 during the maintenance shutdown of the extraction system was simulated using TOUGH-LGM software. Eleven high-density instantaneous surface monitoring (ISM) surveys of methane were conducted on the test site. Gas fluxes were calculated by geostatistical analyses of ISM data correlated to dynamic flux chamber measurements. Variograms using normal transformed data showed good structure, and kriged estimates were much better than inverse distance weighting, due to highly skewed data. Measurement-based estimates of yearly off-site surface emissions were two orders of magnitude higher than modelled advective lateral methane flux. Nucleodensimeter measurements of the porosity were abnormally high, indicating that the backfill was poorly compacted. Kriged porosity maps correlated well with emission maps and areas with vegetation damage. Pumping tests analysis revealed that vertical permeability was higher than radial permeability. All results suggest that most of the lateral migration and consequent emissions to the atmosphere were due to the existence of preferential flow paths through macropores. In December 2006, two passively vented trenches were constructed on the test site. They were successful in countering lateral migration. © ISWA 2008.","Advection; Biogas; Landfill; Lateral migration; Macropores; Methane emission; wmr 1208-2","Biogas; Land fill; Mechanical permeability; Methane; Porosity; Statistical methods; Biogas concentration measurements; Geostatistical analyses; Instantaneous surface monitorng; Gas emissions; biogas; methane; Biogas; Gas emissions; Land fill; Mechanical permeability; Methane; Porosity; Statistical methods; advection; biogas; emission; flux chamber; geostatistics; landfill; methane; permeability; pollutant transport; porosity; urban pollution; variogram; advection; air pollution control; article; atmospheric dispersion; Canada; computer program; computer simulation; densitometry; gas permeability; geostatistical analysis; landfill; pollution monitoring; porosity; priority journal; vegetation; waste gas management; Gases; Permeability; Quebec; Refuse Disposal; Soil; Canada; Montreal; North America; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149092544

Two powerful tools - climate change risk assessment and total water management - can be used to determine the vulnerability of water management systems to climate change. These tools can also be used to drive the development of integrated water management strategies and infrastructure to provide water supplies that are more resilient to the effects of climate change. One approach for assessing the risks of climate change to water systems is to use a dual analytical framework known as the threshold-scenario risk assessment. The framework comprises two parts: the more qualitative threshold risk assessment approach and the quantitative scenario risk assessment approach. This article provides tools, resources, examples, and new, holistic solutions that that can be used to manage both the built and natural portions of the water cycle.

Forests provide important economic, environmental, social, and cultural benefits, so that in forestry, as in other areas of environmental policy and management, there are tensions between economic development and environmental protection. In this article we review the current information on global forest cover and condition, examine the international processes that relate to forest protection and to sustainable forest management, and look at the main forest certification schemes. We consider the link between the international processes and certification schemes and also their combined effectiveness. We conclude that in some regions of the world neither mechanism is achieving forest protection, while in others local or regional implementation is occurring and is having a significant impact. Choice of certification scheme and implementation of management standards are often influenced by a consideration of the associated costs, and there are some major issues over the monitoring of agreed actions and of the criteria and indicators of sustainability. There are currently a number of initiatives seeking to improve the operation of the international forestry framework (e.g., The Montreal Process, the Ministerial Convention of the Protection of Forests in Europe and European Union actions in Europe, the African Timber Organisation and International Tropical Timber Organisation initiative for African tropical forest, and the development of a worldwide voluntary agreement on forestry in the United Nations Forum on Forests). We suggest that there is a need to improve the connections between scientific understanding, policy development, and forestry practice, and also the cooperation between the various international initiatives and processes, so that the international framework is more effective and its influence is extended geographically. © Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences 2008.",,"biodiversity; certification; cost-benefit analysis; environmental policy; environmental protection; forest management; forestry policy; land use change; sustainable forestry; environment; environmental protection; international cooperation; review; tree; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environment; Internationality; Trees",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48249144714

We tested two biological hypotheses for the influence of extreme temperatures on annual southern pine beetle population growth in the context of four alternative hypotheses for density-dependent population regulation. The significance of climate variables and their interaction with population regulation depended on the model of density dependence. The best model included both direct and delayed density dependence of a cubic rather than linear form. Population growth declined with the number of days exceeding 32°C, temperatures previously reported to reduce brood survival. Density dependence also changed with the number of hot days. Growth was highest in years with average minimum winter temperatures. Severely cold winters may reduce survival, whereas warm winters may reduce the efficiency of spring infestation formation. Whereas most previous studies have incorporated climate as an additive effect on growth, we found that the form of delayed density dependence changed with the number of days >32°C. The interaction between temperature and regulation, a potentially common phenomenon in ecology, may explain why southern pine beetle outbreaks do not occur at perfectly regular intervals. Factors other than climate, such as forest management and direct suppression, may have contributed significantly to the timing, severity, and eventual cessation of outbreaks since the mid-1950s. © 2008 Entomological Society of America.","Climate change; Dendroctonus frontalis; Outbreaks; Thanasimus dubius; Upper lethal temperature","beetle; climate change; density dependence; forest management; population dynamics; population growth; population outbreak; survival; animal; article; beetle; biological model; population density; population dynamics; temperature; United States; Animals; Beetles; Models, Biological; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Temperature; Texas; North America; Texas; United States; Coleoptera; Curculionidae; Dendroctonus frontalis; Thanasimus dubius",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46849105675

To control dioxins, it is necessary to determine the mechanism of their formation. Because copper chloride (CuCl2) is one of the strongest catalysts of dioxin formation in fly ash, it is important to study the chemical changes of this compound. To determine the chemical changes of copper, Cu-K x-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectra were examined during the heating of model fly ash using a time-resolved dispersive x-ray absorption fine structure (DXAFS) technique. The change in the absorption edge of the Cu-K XANES spectrum revealed a change in the valence of copper and the temperature dependence of the reduction and oxidation of CuCl2. From room temperature to 270 °C, CuCl2 was reduced, and from &gt;270 to 300 °C, copper was reoxidized in the presence of 10% oxygen. At a constant temperature of 210 or 300 °C, copper was dynamically reduced and oxidized. In experiments using different gas streams, HC1 gas had no effect on the reaction of copper, while oxygen gas was essential for the reoxidation of copper. Our results suggest that dioxin formation in fly ash occurs via the chlorination of carbon with the reduction of CuCl2 and carbon gasification catalyzed by copper oxides.

Patients were then instructed to rate their levels of pain on a visual analog scale over time, and the amount of tooth movement was analyzed. Results: Significant pain reductions were observed with laser treatment from immediately after insertion of separators through day 4, but no differences from the nonirradiated control side were noted thereafter. No significant difference was noted in the amount of tooth movement between the irradiated and nonirradiated group. Conclusions: The hypothesis was rejected.

Uncertainty arises from variable distributional shifts of species' ranges due to climate change. The planning framework consists of a two-stage optimization model that selects a nominal conservation area network in the first stage and evaluates its performance under the climate scenarios in the second stage. The model is applied to eleven at-risk species in Alaska including the threatened Spectacled Eider and Steller's Eider sea ducks and the polar bear. The 109th United States Congress and 2008 federal budget proposed opening for oil and gas development the ""1002 Area"" of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which intersects the Plain. This analysis finds that, if Arctic Alaska experiences 1.5 °C of warming by 2040 (as predicted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's A2 scenario), then potential habitat will decrease significantly for eight of these at-risk species, including the polar bear. This analysis also shows that there is synergism between oil and gas development and climate change. For instance, climate change accompanied by no development of the 1002 Area results in an increase of potential habitat for Steller's Eider. However, if development accompanies climate change, then there is a 20% decrease in that area. Further, this analysis quantifies the tradeoff between development and maintenance of suitable habitat for at-risk species. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The coupled-cavity systems are characterized by a large number of discrete lossy nonorthogonal quasimodes that can be obtained using a combination of the finite-difference time-domain method and the tight-binding approach. We project the electric field Green tensor onto the quasimodes using a non-Hermitian projector and thereby avoid the prohibitive finite-difference time-domain calculation of the Green tensor in large systems. We extend our projection approach to show that the quantum dynamics can be derived from an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian that is the full Hamiltonian projected onto the quasimode basis. We demonstrate the equivalence of the effective Hamiltonian approach with the Green tensor approach for the case of spontaneous emission and show how it can be used to treat multiple-photon, multiple-dot dynamics. The effective Hamiltonian provides a systematic approach to treating interacting quantum-dot-photon dynamics in coupled-cavity systems with a moderate number of quantum dots and photons and can be easily generalized to include nonradiative decay and decoherence of the quantum dots. Finally, we use our approach to model spontaneous emission in an asymmetric two-cavity system in a photonic crystal slab. We show that results obtained using our approach are essentially identical to results using the full Green tensor in the weak-coupling regime. In the strong-coupling regime, we show that the spontaneous emission dynamics are strongly affected by the nonorthogonality of the quasimodes and the results can be easily understood in terms of the quasimode dressed states. © 2008 The American Physical Society.",,"Characterization; Electric field effects; Finite difference time domain method; Photonic crystals; Photons; Tensors; Coupled-cavity systems; Nonorthogonal quasimodes; Photonic crystal slabs; Semiconductor quantum dots",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43449085524

One solution to this is to make parking garages free for a reasonable time period, and to charge visitors once they exceed the time limit. Another is to charge those who prefer street parking, making them more expensive than a garage. This approach offers the benefits of reducing congestion and adding pedestrian safety, helps the environment by reducing the emissions produced by additional driving and idling in congested areas and guarantees a higher turnover of on-street spaces. Another approach is to upgrade meters by employing multispace meters, which charge newly arrived cars even though the time limit for the previous customer has not expired.",,"parking; pedestrian; road pricing; traffic congestion; transportation development; transportation planning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44249093969

Argon was added to the system as a nonabsorbable molecular probe in the polymer to take into account the effect of the volume swelling on the measurement. Sorption behavior has been studied at 50°C by changing the composition and the density of the supercritical phase. We have found that VDF dissolves in its polymer with concentrations much lower man carbon dioxide at similar total and partial pressures. The mixed fluid CO2/VDF behaves as a worse solvent toward PVDF with respect to pure CO2, leading to a reduction of the cumulative sorption. This effect becomes progressively more significant when the fluoromonomer concentration increases. Experimental data obtained from binary systems were fitted using the Sanchez-Lacombe equation of state, and this model was used to estimate the drift in the composition of the polymer phase during the polymerization of VDF in ScCO2.

This large program targets 100 early-type galaxies with the Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer on board the Chandra X-Ray Observatory and the Multiband Imaging Photometer on board the Spitzer Space Telescope, with the aim of providing an unbiased census of low-level supermassive black hole activity in the local universe. Here we report on the Chandra observations of the first 16 targets, and combine them with results from archival data of another, typically more massive, 16 targets. Pointlike X-ray emission from a position coincident with the optical nucleus is detected in 50% of the galaxies (down to our completeness limit of ∼4 × 1038 ergs s-1 ). Two of the X-ray nuclei are hosted by galaxies (VCC 1178 [N4464] and VCC 1297 [N4486B]) with absolute B magnitudes fainter than -18, where nuclear star clusters are known to become increasingly common. After carefully accounting for possible contamination from low-mass X-ray binaries, we argue that the detected nuclear X-ray sources are most likely powered by low-level accretion on to a supermassive black hole, with a ≲11% chance contamination in VCC 1178, where a star cluster is barely resolvable in archival Hubble Space Telescope images. Based on black hole mass estimates from the global properties of the host galaxies, all the detected nuclei are highly sub-Eddington, with luminosities in the range -8.4 lt; log(L0.3-10 keV/LEdd) &lt; -5.9. The incidence of nuclear X-ray activity increases with the stellar mass M* of the host galaxy: only between 3% and 44% of the galaxies with M*, &lt; 1010 M ⊙ harbor an X-ray active supermassive black hole.

In the present work Nd:YAG laser light pulses (λ=∈1064 nm, 6 ns) of different energies (25, 50, 75 and 100 mJ) are focused using a quartz lens (focal length 10 cm) onto certified aluminum alloy samples in air under atmospheric pressure. The emitted spectra are collected and analyzed using an echelle spectrometer coupled with an intensified charge coupled device camera. The temporal history of the plasma is obtained by recording the emission features at predetermined delays and at a fixed gate width (2500 ns). For each spectrum both electron density and excitation temperature are calculated for each delay time and laser pulse energy; we found that the values of the electron density are decreasing from 1018 to 1017 cm-3. The corresponding excitation temperatures were between 30000 and 4000 K depending on the laser pulse energy and the sample used. The LTE conditions were followed up for the different delays and different energies to determine the temporal range in which they are satisfied. It has been found that in the cases of 25- and 50-mJ laser energies, the LTE conditions were satisfied in the chosen delay range (500-5000 ns). On the other hand, for higher laser energies, the LTE conditions were critical at delay times less than 1500 ns and are satisfied for longer delays. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Carrier concentration; CCD cameras; Emission spectroscopy; Laser pulses; Thermodynamics; Excitation temperatures; Laser pulse energy; Local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE); Laser produced plasmas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44449158564

When the Fe2O3-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 catalyst was exposed to a mixture of CO and H2, the majority of the surface species depicted by the DRIFT analysis were associated with carbonates. The carbonates were essentially stable in a He atmosphere at temperatures ranging from 60 to 450 °C. An increase in the temperature leads to the conversion of the carbonates, where the oxygen comes from the catalyst lattice. Investigations carried out using a H2O/He mixture showed that carbon oxides were produced during the interconversion of carbonate species on the catalyst surface with steam. The main gas component produced during the TPD of an Fe2O3-Ce0.5Zr0.5O2 catalyst in the temperature interval of 60-500 °C was carbon dioxide. The amount of carbon oxides produced decreased at elevated temperatures. The steady-state isotopic C18O experiments revealed that the Boudouard reaction occurred at temperatures higher than 350 °C.

It argues that the current government strategy, investment policy and industrial interest are over-emphasized on biomass-burning power generation as part of the clean energy development trajectories, which may not lead to the most cost-effective outcomes in terms of investments, resource use and social development objectives. It points out that there are large potentials in developing and disseminating household-based biomass technologies in rural areas, especially with energy-efficient modern biomass stoves, which can produce far more economic, social and environmental benefits than biomass power plants. It is a decentralized solution to use renewable energy resources for meeting multi-objectives. It is suggested that key incentive policies be provided by the government to encourage this technological transition, or the leapfrogging from using traditional household stoves towards modern biomass stoves, which will lead to a win-win situation in global, regional and local environmental protection, sustainable resource management and related social benefits, particularly for the poor in remote communities. Six policy recommendations are made: (1) financial schemes development; (2) preferable tax and carbon tax; (3) regulatory policy reform; (4) service industry support; (5) market research, training and capacity building for key stakeholders; (6) development of methodologies and standards for CDM projects.

Understanding the complexity of diurnal ozone processes and their relationships with precursors is thus critical for identifying optimal transportation emissions control strategies. This paper uses functional data analysis methods to model the dynamics of diurnal ozone and nitrogen oxides cycles, their interrelationships, and the multilevel spatio-temporal variations of ozone and nitrogen oxides measurements from Southern California. Functional data analysis accounts for the continuous nature of diurnal ozone/nitrogen oxides processes by converting discrete observations into functional diurnal curves. Results show important, but low-dimensional, spatio-temporal variations in diurnal ozone/nitrogen oxides cycles.

Particularly under semi-arid conditions, the acquisition of water and nutrients is highly variable during the vegetation growth period and between years. Additionally, grazing is repeatedly disturbing the functional equilibrium between the root system and the transpiring leaf canopy. However, very few data is available considering grazing effects on belowground net primary productivity (BNPP) and root-shoot dry mass allocation in natural grassland systems. We hypothesise that grazing significantly reduces BNPP due to carbon reallocation to shoot growth. Root biomass and BNPP were estimated by soil coring in 2004, 2005 and 2006 and from ingrowth cores in 2005 and 2006 at one site which has been protected from grazing since 1979 (UG79), at one winter grazing (WG), and one heavily grazed (HG) site. BNPP was estimated from the summation of significant increments of total and live root biomass and from accumulated root biomass of ingrowth cores. Belowground biomass varied from 1,490-2,670 g m-2 and was significantly lower under heavy grazing than at site UG79. Root turnover varied from 0.23 to 0.33 year-1 and was not significantly different between sites. Heavy grazing significantly decreased live root biomass and BNPP compared to site UG79. Taking BNPP estimates from live root biomass dynamics and ingrowth cores as the most reliable values, the portion of dry mass allocated belowground relative to total net primary productivity (BNPP/NPP) varied between 0.50-0.66 and was reduced under heavy grazing in 2005, but not in 2006. The positive correlation between cumulative root length density of ingrowth cores and leaf dry matter suggests that the ingrowth core method is suitable for studying BNPP in this semi-arid steppe system. Grazing effects on BNPP and BNPP/NPP should be considered in regional carbon models and estimates of belowground nutrient cycling. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","BNPP; Cumulative root length density; Grazing intensity; Ingrowth core method; Semi-arid grassland","belowground biomass; belowground production; biomass allocation; grassland; grazing pressure; net primary production; nutrient cycling; root system; semiarid region; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Nei Monggol",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43349103199

The widespread adoption of small local power generators presents a path for early action on climate change by reducing the emissions associated with a centralised fossil fuel electricity system. A strong potential influence on the emergence of a domestic distributed energy market in Australia is the willingness of the public to accept distributed generation. To study the potential acceptance of distributed energy we considered the environmental concern and consumer technology adoption literature. We then surveyed 706 householders from four Australian states during 2007. Our analysis of these data pointed to the public's willingness to accept the use of distributed generators, identified attitudinal and demographic characteristics related to higher acceptance, and assessed preferences regarding the technology's features. These findings provide a basis for understanding the behaviour of the public in the advent of a domestic distributed energy market. Implications are presented for decision-makers involved with domestic distributed energy and for researchers of products that have both environmental and technological characteristics. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Distributed energy; Public attitudes; Technology adoption","climate change; electricity generation; electricity supply; emission control; energy market; household survey; preference behavior; public attitude; technology adoption; Australasia; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48249143167

Barnhart Building, Lexington, KY 40546-0276, United States","Using recently published baseline ammonia emissions data for U.S. broiler chicken housing, we present a method of estimating their contribution to an annual ammonia budget that is different from that used by USEPA. Emission rate increases in a linear relationship with flock age from near zero at the start of the flock to a maximum at the end of the flock, 28-65 days later. Market weight of chickens raised for meat varies from ""broilers"" weighing about 2 kg to ""roasters"" weighing about 3 kg. Multiple flocks of birds are grown in a single house annually, with variable downtime to prepare the house between flocks. The method takes into account weight and number of chickens marketed. Uncertainty in baseline emissions estimates is used so that inventory estimates are provided with error estimates. The method also incorporates the condition of litter that birds are raised upon and the varying market weight of birds grown. Using 2003 USDA data on broiler production numbers, broiler housing is estimated to contribute 8.8-11.7 kT ammonia for new and built-up litter, respectively, in Kentucky and 240-324 kT ammonia for new and built-up litter, respectively, nationally. Results suggest that a 10% uncertainty in annual emission rate is expected for the market weight categories of broilers, heavy broilers, and roasters. A 27-47% reduction in annual housing emission rate is predicted if new rather than built-up litter were used for every flock. The estimating method can be adapted to other meat bird building emissions and future ammonia emission strategies, with suitable insertion of an age-dependent emission factor or slope into a predictive model equation. The method can be readily applied and is an alternative to that used by USEPA. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Scenarios for feedstock production were examined using a life-cycle approach. We considered both purpose grown bioenergy crops (BEC) and the use of crop wastes (CW) as feedstocks. The BEC scenarios involved a change from growing winter wheat to purpose grown miscanthus, switchgrass, and corn as bioenergy crops. The CW scenarios consider both corn stover and winter wheat straw as feedstocks. Our findings show that the avoided emissions are between 2 and 5 times greater when biochar is applied to agricultural land (2-19 Mg CO2 ha-1 y-1) than used solely for fossil energy offsets. 41-64% of these emission reductions are related to the retention of C in biochar, the rest to offsetting fossil fuel use for energy, fertilizer savings, and avoided soil emissions other than CO2. Despite a reduction in energy output of approximately 30% where the slow pyrolysis technology is optimized to produce biochar for land application, the energy produced per unit energy input at 2-7 MJ/MJ is greater than that of comparable technologies such as ethanol from corn. The C emissions per MWh of electricity production range from 91-360 kg CO2 MWh -1, before accounting for C offset due to the use of biochar are considerably below the lifecycle emissions associated with fossil fuel use for electricity generation (600-900 kg CO2 MWh-1). Low-temperature slow pyrolysis offers an energetically efficient strategy for bioenergy production, and the land application of biochar reduces greenhouse emissions to a greater extent than when the biochar is used to offset fossil fuel emissions. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Greenhouse gases; Optimization; Particulate emissions; Pyrolysis; Biochar sequestration; Crop wastes (CW); Energy production; Energy balance; alcohol; biochar; charcoal; fertilizer; fossil fuel; Energy balance; Greenhouse gases; Optimization; Particulate emissions; Pyrolysis; bioenergy; electricity generation; emission control; energy balance; energy crop; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; optimization; pyrolysis; sequestration (chemistry); soil emission; agricultural land; article; bioenergy; corn; crop management; electricity; energy balance; exhaust gas; feedstock; greenhouse effect; life cycle; material state; process optimization; pyrolysis; separation technique; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Carbon Dioxide; Heat; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Poaceae; Miscanthus; Panicum virgatum; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44449160515

Two emission scenarios represent best estimates of 2002 and 2004 emissions; they allow assessment of the impact of the NOx emissions reductions imposed on the utility sector by the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call. The third scenario represents a hypothetical rendering of what NOx emissions would have been in 2002 if no emission controls had been imposed on the utility sector. Examination of the modeled median and 95th percentile daily maximum 8-hr average ozone concentrations reveals that median ozone levels estimated for the 2004 emission scenario were less than those modeled for 2002 in the region most affected by the NOx SIP Call. Comparison of the ""no-control"" with the ""2002"" scenario revealed that ozone concentrations would have been much higher in much of the eastern United States if the utility sector had not implemented NOx emission controls; exceptions occurred in the immediate vicinity of major point sources where increased NO titration tends to lower ozone levels.

The target seams (Seam 4 and Seam 10) were intersected at 652 m and 605 m, respectively. The coals were bright banded, relatively competent and reasonably cleated, with cleat spacing between 5-20 mm. The FMI (Formation Micro-Imaging) log identified two primary fracture directions, corresponding to both face and butt cleats, which were developed almost equally in some coal intervals. The amount of shearing was limited, in spite of the presence of numerous thrust faults and fold structures in the corehole vicinity. Total gas content was high, with an average of 17.7 cm3/g (arb; 568.1 scf/t). An adsorption isotherm of the thick Seam 4 showed gas saturation levels of 90% at in-situ reservoir conditions. Methane content was 92-96% and carbon dioxide levels were less than 2%. Isotopic studies on the methane confirmed the thermogenic origin of the gas, as anticipated based on the coal rank. The coal seams were fracture stimulated using 50/50 nitrogen and fresh water along with 9 to 12 tons of 12/20 mesh sand used as a proppant. It is believed that the coals were not stimulated properly because of the small proppant volume and the complex - and often unpredictable - fracture pattern in coals, particularly in the Inner Foothills region that has high stress anisotropy. An injectivity test showed coal absolute permeability to be less than 1 mD, the skin to be - 2 (indicating a slightly damaged coal) and water saturation in the cleats to be 90%. A four-month production test was conducted; gas rates declined from 930 to 310 m3/d (33 to 11 MCFD) and water rates were low (&lt; 5 BWD). Produced water was saline (TDS was 20,000 mg/L) and high in chloride and bicarbonate ions. Production testing was followed by history matching and numerical simulation, which consisted of numerous vertical and horizontal well development scenarios and other parameters. Simulating multiple parallel horizontal wells in the Gates coals resulted in the highest peak gas production rates, cumulative production and recovery efficiencies, in agreement with public data from the Mannville coals in the deeper part of the Alberta Syncline. The positive effect of constructive interference in depressurizing the coal reservoirs and accelerating gas production over short periods of time was demonstrated. Coal quality data from a nearby underground mine shows that drilling horizontal wellbores in the Gates coals would be challenging because of unfavourable geomechanical properties, such as low cohesion and unconfined compressive strength values, and structural complexity. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

On the other hand, chlorine gas is added as a disinfectant agent in two steps, pre- and post-chlorination. Due to these reasons most of water treatment plants suffer low filtering effectiveness and produce the trihalomethane (THM) species as a chlorination by-product. The Ismailia Canal represents the most distal downstream of the main Nile River. Thus its water contains all the proceeded pollutants discharged into the Nile. In addition, the downstream reaches of the canal act as an agricultural drain during the closing period of the High Dam gates in January and February every year. Moreover, the wide industrial zone along the upstream course of the canal enriches the canal water with high concentrations of heavy metals. The obtained results indicate that the canal gains up to 24.06×106 m3 of water from the surrounding shallow aquifer during the closing period of the High Dam gates, while during the rest of the year, the canal acts as an influent stream losing about 99.6×106 m3 of its water budget. The reduction of total organic carbon (TOC) and suspended particulate matters (SPMs) should be one of the central goals of any treatment plan to avoid the disinfectants by-products. The combination of sedimentation basins, gravel pre-filtration and slow sand filtration, and underground passage with microbiological oxidation-reduction and adsorption criteria showed good removal of parasites and bacteria and complete elimination of TOC, SPM and heavy metals. Moreover, it reduces the use of disinfectants chemicals and lowers the treatment costs. However, this purification system under the arid climate prevailing in Egypt should be tested and modified prior to application. © Zhejiang University Press 2008.","Drinking water treatment; Egypt; Hazardous by-products; Ismailia Canal; Natural attenuation","chlorine; disinfectant agent; drinking water; heavy metal; organic carbon; surface water; trihalomethane; adsorption; article; bacterium; chlorination; Egypt; filtration; oxidation reduction reaction; parasite; priority journal; river; sedimentation; suspended particulate matter; waste component removal; water management; water pollutant; water supply; water treatment; Egypt; Industry; Seasons; Water Microbiology; Water Movements; Water Pollutants; Water Purification; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41349096258

We present a sedimentological and paleoclimatic analysis for Belan sections, incorporating new luminescence and radiocarbon dates and a compilation of previous research. Some 20 m of strata are exposed in fluvial terraces, commencing with pedogenic and channel calcretes linked to groundwater ponding on the underlying bedrock. Overlying alluvium deposited from mixed-load meandering rivers yields dates between 85±11 and 72±8 kyr before present (BP), implying sustained fluvial activity during Marine Isotope Stage 5 and later; these strata contain Middle Paleolithic artifacts. Thin reworked gravels with Upper Paleolithic artifacts are dated at ∼21-31 kyr BP, and may represent declining alluviation and floodplain gully erosion during reduced monsoonal activity around the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Younger channel fills contain shell-rich eolian sand, and mounds of shelly sand lie inland from the river. Five OSL dates from the sands span 14 to 7 kyr BP, corresponding to a period of climatic instability that includes the Younger Dryas as the monsoon intensified following the LGM. Although suggesting more arid phases, the source-bordering eolian material has a small volume and the grains are partially bleached, indicating local wind action. Overlying floodplain muds reflect renewed alluviation, after which the river incised during peak monsoon flow. The Mesolithic settlement of Chopani-Mando spans a period of reduced monsoon activity and climatic instability following the LGM. Subsequent Neolithic settlements were probably established under stronger monsoon conditions suitable for the development of agriculture. Mesolithic habitation may have ended when a nearby bedrock channel was abandoned as the reinvigorated Belan cut a new course, along which Neolithic settlements were later established. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A storage capacity of about 50 million tonnes of CO2 per annum for a 40-year injection period is required, which will necessitate several individual storage sites to be used both sequentially and simultaneously, but timed such that existing hydrocarbon assets will not be compromised. Detailed characterisation focussed on the Kingfish Field area as the first site to be potentially used, in the anticipation that this oil field will be depleted within the period 2015-2025. The potential injection targets are the interbedded sandstones of the Paleocene-Eocene upper Latrobe Group, regionally sealed by the Lakes Entrance Formation. The research identified several features to the offshore Gippsland Basin that make it particularly favourable for CO2 storage. These include: a complex stratigraphic architecture that provides baffles which slow vertical migration and increase residual gas trapping and dissolution; non-reactive reservoir units that have high injectivity; a thin, suitably reactive, lower permeability marginal reservoir just below the regional seal providing mineral trapping; several depleted oil fields that provide storage capacity coupled with a transient production-induced flow regime that enhances containment; and long migration pathways beneath a competent regional seal. This study has shown that the Gippsland Basin has sufficient capacity to store very large volumes of CO2. It may provide a solution to the problem of substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions from future coal developments in the Latrobe Valley. © 2007 Innovative Carbon Technologies Pty Ltd.","Australia; CO2; Gippsland Basin; Storage","Gas emissions; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Oil fields; Petroleum reservoirs; Coal developments; Geological storage systems; Storage capacity; Carbon dioxide; basin; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; Eocene; oil field; Paleocene; sandstone; site characterization; stratigraphy; Australasia; Australia; Bass Strait; Gippsland Basin; Kingfish Field",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349112235

We present new isotope data of carbonate-hosted ores from the Iglesiente district (Sardinia, Italy) and Vila Ruiva (Portugal), as well as from the silicate-hosted ores of the Broken Hill district, New South Wales (Australia) and Freihung (Germany) and review previously published isotope data. The temperature dependence of oxygen isotope fractionation between Pb and Zn carbonate minerals and water below 240 °C for cerussite and below 100 °C for smithsonite and phosgenite can be expressed as1000lnαcerussite-water = 2.29(106 / T2) - 3.561000lnαsmithsonite-water = 3.10(106 / T2) - 3.501000lnαphosgenite-water = 2.55(106 / T2) - 3.50with T in Kelvin. The carbon isotope fractionation between smithsonite, phosgenite, hydrozincite and calcite is less than about 2‰, while cerussites are strongly depleted in 13C by about 10‰ as compared to the former minerals. Oxygen isotope variations of individual carbonate minerals within a deposit are relatively small indicating constant formation temperatures and a single, meteoric fluid source. Average formation temperatures of the studied deposits are calculated at 20 ± 5 °C using the estimated isotope compositions of local paleometeoric waters. We observe a linear relationship between the isotope values of estimated paleometeoric waters and supergene carbonates. Thus, base metal carbonate minerals from supergene deposits may provide paleoclimatic information. The carbon isotope values are in most carbonate-hosted deposits highly variable (more than 10‰) suggesting at least two isotopically distinct carbon sources. The isotopically light component can be related to oxidation of C3 plants (soil-derived carbon) and/or microbes that take active part in sulfide oxidation, while the isotopically heavy component originates from carbonate carbon from wall rocks and/or atmospheric carbon. The 13C-enriched component is less dominant in silicate-hosted deposits. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Should consumers buy RECs or emission offsets? After examining this question, the author concludes that RECs are not equivalent to emission offset credits, and as currently defined, the retiring of a REC may have no impact on emissions from electric power generation. Consumers who purchase RECs in voluntary green power markets are providing financial assistance to renewable generators in the form of a production subsidy. Generators that sell RECs are not transferring emission reductions, since they are unlikely to have ownership or the ability to quantify reductions using a commonly accepted standard. More importantly, RECs currently sold in voluntary markets do not pass credible additionality tests and can, at best, be expected to have a market demand effect, which will be less than the supply of RECs on the market. REC definitions that use the term ""environmental attributes"" or ""environmental benefits"" are almost universally ambiguous, providing the mistaken impression that consumers are purchasing a good instead of subsidizing a public good. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

How should emission-trading schemes treat RECs? How can emission mitigation policies provide real incentives for renewable generation? The objective of REC markets should be to promote additional renewable energy investments. The author asserts that defining RECs in terms of attributes, especially off-site attributes, does not further this goal. Ambiguous language such as ""environmental attribute"" or ""environmental benefit"" creates confusion in the marketplace while failing to address the relevant coordination issues with Renewable Portfolio Standard compliance markets, voluntary emission offset markets, or emission cap-and-trade markets. Specifically, defining RECs in terms of off-site attributes creates a number of problems, including that once an emissions cap-and-trade scheme is in place, such definitions of a REC can become indefensible. The author proposes to redefine RECs in terms of on-site attributes, which resolves the aforementioned problems and allows compliance and voluntary renewable energy and emission markets to function without conflicts. Ideally, environmental commodities should be homogeneous, first best measures of the relevant environmental good, as well as easily measured and verified.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides inventory methodology guidance to the Parties of the UNFCCC. This methodology guidance, and national inventories based on it, omits carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmospheric oxidation of methane, carbon monoxide, and non-methane volatile organic compounds emissions that result from several source categories. The inclusion of this category of ""indirect"" CO2 in GHG inventories increases global anthropogenic emissions (excluding land use and forestry) between 0.5 and 0.7%. However, the effect of inclusion on aggregate UNFCCC Annex I Party GHG emissions would be to reduce the growth of total emissions, from 1990 to 2004, by 0.2% points. The effect on the GHG emissions and emission trends of individual countries varies. The paper includes a methodology for calculating these emissions and discusses uncertainties. Indirect CO2 is equally relevant for GHG inventories at other scales, such as global, regional, organizational, and facility.

Traditionally, the model-predicted pollutant concentrations are evaluated for the ""base case"" to assess a model's ability to reproduce past observations. Dynamic evaluation approaches, which evaluate a model's ability to accurately simulate air quality changes from given changes in emissions, are critically important to regulatory applications. Here, we investigate approaches to evaluate the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model's predicted ozone (O3) response to large NOx emission reductions associated with the NOx State Implementation Plan (SIP) Call and on-road mobile emissions. This case has the advantages that emission changes associated with the NOx SIP Call can be well characterized and substantial changes are observed in O3 levels. To consider the modeled response to emission changes in light of the strong meteorological influences on O3, two time periods after the NOx SIP Call are included with very different meteorological conditions. The sensitivity to chemical mechanisms is also considered by including simulations with the CB4, SAPRC, and CB05 chemical mechanisms. The evaluation results suggest that the air quality model predictions underestimate the O3 reductions observed after the NOx SIP Call was implemented. While the emission estimate uncertainties may also be a factor, the results suggest that the contribution of long-range transport of O3 and precursors is underpredicted, especially when using the CB4 chemical mechanism. Further investigation of the chemical mechanisms' ability to characterize tropospheric chemistry aloft is recommended. Results based on the most recent CMAQ version 4.6 with CB05 and updated emission inventories show incremental improvements to the modeled O3 response to NOx emission reductions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To help out with this need, airline operators are doing their part as they wash their planes between flights and looks on for an optimized route as a way of attaining fuel and operating efficiencies. Boeing, on the other hand, does research and development and ensures that their environmental strategy has a clear and precise focus. And Boeing makes sure that they improve their environmental performance without disrupting the flow of people and commerce around the world.",,"air transportation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; conference proceeding; emission control; greenhouse gas; growth rate; industrial development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45849096436

The Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was utilized in photochemical simulations on a matrix of modeling scenarios permitting an examination of the separate effects of emission changes and meteorological influences on maximum ozone levels over a 3-month period during the summers of 2002 and 2004. Two modeling scenarios involved base case 2002 emissions and post-control emissions, reflecting the point source NOx emission reductions implemented before the ozone season of 2004, using summer 2002 meteorological conditions. Results revealed that point source NOx emission reductions caused decreases in daily maximum 8-h ozone concentrations over the eastern United States. At the 50th and 95th percentiles of the cumulative frequency distribution, daily maximum 8-h ozone values in the emission reduction scenario were lower than corresponding base case values over 70% and 90% of the modeling domain, respectively. During southwesterly wind flows across the Ohio River Valley, morning ozone concentrations aloft were lower over northeastern states downwind of the emissions-rich region in the NOx reduction scenario results. Another notable feature of the NOx emission reduction scenario results is that greater decreases in daily maximum 8-h ozone occurred at higher concentrations. Results from other modeling scenarios revealed strong differences in meteorological conditions between these two summer periods greatly impacted the daily 8-h maximum ozone concentrations with the meteorological effects on ozone being greater than those from emission changes over the northern part of the modeling domain. Using backtrajectory analysis, greater percentage decreases in daily maximum 8-h ozone occurred at monitoring sites when they were downwind of the Ohio River Valley, which is a notable emission source region, as compared to cases when the sites were not downwind of it.","CMAQ; HYSPLIT; NOx emission reductions; Photochemical ozone; Trajectory analysis","Air quality; Computer simulation; Gas emissions; Nitrogen oxides; Wind effects; Emission reductions; Photochemical ozone; Photochemical simulations; Trajectory analysis; Ozone; nitrogen oxide; ozone; air quality; emission control; environmental assessment; environmental modeling; meteorology; nitrogen oxides; ozone; photochemistry; point source pollution; pollution monitoring; spatial analysis; trajectory; air analysis; air pollution; air quality; article; chemical analysis; meteorology; model; photochemistry; priority journal; simulation; summer; United States; North America; Ohio Valley [Pennsylvania-Ohio]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37349048938

Normally, soils and sawdust had been used as cheap readily available sorbent materials of spills of fuel oil, consisting of complex mixtures of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons. Chilean legislation considers these fuel oil contaminated mixtures of soil and sawdust as hazardous wastes, and thus they must be contained. It remains unknown whether it would be feasible to clean-up Chilean desert soils with high salinity and metal content, historically polluted with different commercial fuel oil, and contained during years. Thus, this study evaluated the feasibility of aerated in-vessel composting at a laboratory scale as a bioremediation technology to clean-up contaminated desert mining soils (fuel concentration &gt; 50,000 mg kg-1) and sawdust (fuel concentration &gt; 225,000 mg kg-1) in the Atacama Region. The composting reactors were operated using five soil to sawdust ratios (S:SD, 1:0, 3:1, 1:1, 1:3, 0:1, on a dry weight basis) under mesophilic temperatures (30-40 °C), constant moisture content (MC, 50%) and continuous aeration (16 l min-1) during 56 days. Fuel oil concentration and physico-chemical changes in the composting reactors were monitored following standard procedures. The highest (59%) and the lowest (35%) contaminant removals were observed in the contaminated sawdust and contaminated soil reactors after 56 days of treatment, respectively. The S:SD ratio, time of treatment and interaction between both factors had a significant effect (p &lt; 0.050) on the contaminant removal. The results of this research indicate that bioremediation of an aged contaminated mixture of desert mining soil and sawdust with fuel oil is feasible. This study recommends a S:SD ratio 1:3 and a correct nutrient balance in order to achieve a maximum overall hydrocarbon removal of fuel oil in the weathered and aged contaminated wastes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Efforts are being made to study methane emission from rice paddies in different ways. In particular, selection of rice cultivars that emit less methane is practical because it does not change farmer practices. Assam state is a rice-growing state of the northeastern part of India. Assam state is very rich in the rice genepool. Here, we screened rice cultivars popularly grown during the monsoon season of Assam. Five traditional cultivars and five high-yield modern cultivars were grown in the field. Methane emission was measured for the whole crop-growing season. Crop growth parameters including plant height, tiller number, leaf number, plant biomass, leaf area index and grain yield were recorded. Soil parameters such as soil temperature, soil pH and soil organic carbon were also recorded. Our results show that the methane emission of rice cultivars ranged from 8.83 g m-2 to 18.63 g m-2 over three and a half months. Variety IR 36 was found to emit the least methane amongst all the cultivars. Five cultivars were identified as high methane-emitting cultivars (&gt;15 g m-2. Methane flux values of the crop-growing season exhibited a positive correlation with leaf number, tiller number and leaf area index. Traditional rice cultivars with profuse vegetative growth recorded higher methane flux values compared with high-yielding varieties.

We use steroid-inducible 3α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase/carbonyl reductase (3α-HSD/CR) as a reporter system to study steroid signaling in Comamonas testosteroni. In previous investigations we cloned and characterized the 3α-HSD/CR-encoding gene, hsdA. In addition, we identified two negative regulator genes (repA and repB) in the vicinity of hsdA, the protein products which repress hsdA expression on the level of transcription and translation, respectively. Recently, a positive regulator of hsdA expression, TeiR (testosterone-inducible regulator), was found by transposon mutagenesis, but the mode of its action remained obscure. In the present work we produced a TeiR-green fluorescent fusion protein and showed that TeiR is a membrane protein with asymmetrical localization at one of the cell poles of C. testosteroni. Knock-out mutants of the teiR gene revealed that TeiR provides swimming and twitching motility of C. testosteroni to the steroid substrate source. TeiR also mediated an induced expression of 3α-HSD/CR which was paralleled by an enhanced catabolism of testosterone. We also found that TeiR responds to a variety of different steroids other than testosterone. Biochemical analysis with several deletion mutants of the teiR gene revealed TeiR to consist of three different functional domains, an N-terminal domain important for membrane association, a central steroid binding site, and a C-terminal part mediating TeiR function. Finally, we could demonstrate that TeiR works as a kinase in the steroid signaling chain in C. testosteroni. Overall, we provide evidence that TeiR mediates steroid sensing and metabolism in C. testosteroni via its steroid binding and kinase activity. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Binding energy; Binding sites; Biochemistry; Cell membranes; Gene encoding; Lipids; Metabolism; Port terminals; Biochemical analysis; Cell poles; Comamonas testosteroni; Deletion mutants; Encoding genes; Functional domains; Fusion proteins; Gene regulations; Kinase activities; Knock outs; Membrane associations; Membrane proteins; Negative regulators; Positive regulators; Reporter systems; Signaling chains; Steroid substrates; Terminal domains; Testosteroni; Transposon mutagenesises; Transcription; 3alpha hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase; green fluorescent protein; hybrid protein; membrane protein; phosphotransferase; steroid; testosterone; testosterone inducible regulator; unclassified drug; bacterial protein; recombinant protein; TeiR protein, Comamonas testosteroni; testosterone; amino terminal sequence; article; bacterial gene; bacterial metabolism; binding site; carboxy terminal sequence; Comamonas testosteroni; deletion mutant; enzyme activity; enzyme induction; nonhuman; priority journal; protein domain; protein expression; signal transduction; teir gene; biological model; chemistry; enzyme linked immunosorbent assay; gene deletion; gene expression regulation; metabolism; molecular cloning; mutation; physiology; plasmid; protein binding; protein tertiary structure; Comamonas testosteroni; Bacterial Proteins; Cloning, Molecular; Comamonas testosteroni; Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Membrane Proteins; Models, Biological; Models, Genetic; Mutation; Phosphotransferases; Plasmids; Protein Binding; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Recombinant Proteins; Signal Transduction; Steroids; Testosterone",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47749106430

Positive impacts are the elimination of lead compounds from gasoline and the reduction of noxious emissions. There is also the reduction of CO2 emissions, since sugarcane ethanol requires only a small amount of fossil fuels for its production, being thus a renewable fuel. These positive impacts are particularly noticeable in the air quality improvement of metropolitan areas but also in rural areas where mechanized harvesting of green cane is being introduced, eliminating the burning of sugarcane. Negative impacts such as future large-scale ethanol production from sugarcane might lead to the destruction or damage of high-biodiversity areas, deforestation, degradation or damaging of soils through the use of chemicals and soil decarbonization, water resources contamination or depletion, competition between food and fuel production decreasing food security and a worsening of labor conditions on the fields. These questions are discussed here, with the purpose of clarifying the sustainability aspects of ethanol production from sugarcane mainly in São Paulo State, where more than 60% of Brazil's sugarcane plantations are located and are responsible for 62% of ethanol production. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, in many tropical regions records are only available from a small number of sites. This can limit the application of predictive modelling, particularly in the case of rare and endangered species. We aim to address this problem by developing a methodology for defining and mapping species pools associated with climatic variables in order to investigate potential species turnover and regional species loss under climate change scenarios combined with anthropogenic disturbance. Location: The study covered an area of 6800 km2 in the highlands of Chiapas, southern Mexico. Methods: We derived climatically associated species pools from floristic inventory data using multivariate analysis combined with spatially explicit discriminant analysis. We then produced predictive maps of the distribution of tree species pools using data derived from 451 inventory plots. After validating the predictive power of potential distributions against an independent historical data set consisting of 3105 botanical collections, we investigated potential changes in the distribution of tree species resulting from forest disturbance and climate change. Results: Two species pools, associated with moist and cool climatic conditions, were identified as being particularly threatened by both climate change and ongoing anthropogenic disturbance. A change in climate consistent with low-emission scenarios of general circulation models was shown to be sufficient to cause major changes in equilibrium forest composition within 50 years. The same species pools were also found to be suffering the fastest current rates of deforestation and internal forest disturbance. Disturbance and deforestation, in combination with climate change, threaten the regional distributions of five tree species listed as endangered by the IUCN. These include the endemic species Magnolia sharpii Miranda and Wimmeria montana Lundell. Eleven vulnerable species and 34 species requiring late successional conditions for their regeneration could also be threatened. Main conclusions: Climatically associated species pools can be derived from floristic inventory data available for tropical regions using methods based on multivariate analysis even when data limitations prevent effective application of individual species modelling. Potential consequences of climate change and anthropogenic disturbance on the species diversity of montane tropical forests in our study region are clearly demonstrated by the method. © 2007 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Chiapas; Climate change; Climatic envelopes; Conservation; Disturbance; Diversity; Species distribution Modelling","climate change; deforestation; discriminant analysis; endemic species; environmental disturbance; floristics; geographical distribution; modeling; montane forest; multivariate analysis; species diversity; species pool; tree; tropical region; upland region; Chiapas; Mexico [North America]; North America; Magnolia sharpii; Magnoliaceae; Wimmeria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949212149

Using emission factors that were calculated from the relationship between the electricity produced and amount of treated wastes, the GHG emissions in the Oeiras municipality, were estimated for a time series of 6 years (1998-2003). The obtained results showed that the electricity sector accounts for about 75% of the municipal emissions in 2003. This study was developed in order to obtain tools to base options and actions to be undertaken by local authorities such as energy planning and also public information. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Allelopathic interactions between invasive and native species have been suggested to be an important mechanism for the success of some of the most aggressive plant invaders. However, field experiments that test the effects of natural levels of allelopathic compounds on coexisting native species are exceptionally rare. 2. In this study, we analyzed the allelopathic effects of the invasive tree Ailanthus altissima on seedling emergence, survival and growth of three native tree species (Acer rubrum, A. saccharum and Quercus rubra) in temperate forests of the northeastern United States. We used activated carbon (AC) to reduce potential allelopathic interference, and developed neighbourhood models that explain the observed spatial variation in the effects of the AC treatments on seedling performance as a function of the size, abundance and distribution of Ailanthus trees in the neighbourhood. 3. Our results showed that the addition of AC to the soil did not affect seedling emergence or survival, but caused a significant increase in seedling growth of all three species. Moreover, the AC shifted the overall interaction between Ailanthus and maple seedlings from neutral or slightly positive to very positive for A. rubrum, and from negative to positive for A. saccharum, whereas the net interaction between Ailanthus and Q. rubra was always negative. As Ailanthus has the ability to increase soil fertility, these species-specific responses are presumably influenced by among-species differences in the net effects of both allelopathy and changes in resource availability caused by the presence of Ailanthus. 4. The cumulative allelopathic effects of Ailanthus were proportional to the density of Ailanthus in the neighbourhood, regardless of their size. In contrast, Ailanthus effects were strongly influenced by distance from a tree, generally dropping to zero within 5 m from the trunk. 5. Synthesis. Taken together, our results indicate that allelopathy is an important mechanism to take into account when trying to understand the causes and consequences of plant invasions. However, this study also strongly suggests that the real significance of the allelopathic effects of an invasive species cannot be assessed independently of its target community, or in isolation of other resource interactions involving the invader and the native community. © 2008 The Authors.","Acer rubrum; Acer saccharum; Activated carbon; Ailanthus altissima; Allelopathy; Field experiment; Invasive species; Neighbourhood models; Plant interactions; Quercus rubra; Seedling performance","abundance; activated carbon; aggression; allelopathy; deciduous tree; growth; invasive species; population density; population distribution; population size; resource availability; seedling emergence; soil fertility; spatial variation; survival; temperate forest; North America; United States; Acer; Acer rubrum; Acer saccharum; Ailanthus; Ailanthus altissima; Quercus rubra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149121647

Flash-induced fluorescence kinetics showed that in the absence of DCMU, the half time of the fast and slow components decreased while that of the middle component increased considerably with increasing salt concentration. In the presence of DCMU, fluorescence relaxation was dominated by a 0.6s component in control cells. After salt stress, this was partially replaced by a faster new component with half time of 20-50 ms. Thermoluminescence measurements revealed that S2QA- and S2QB- recombinations were shifted to higher temperatures in parallel and the intensities of the thermoluminescence emissions were significantly reduced in salt-stressed cells. The period-four oscillation of the thermoluminescence B band was highly damped. There were no significant changes in contents of CP47, CP43, cytochrome c550, and D1 proteins. However, content of the PsbO protein in thylakoid fraction decreased but increased significantly in soluble fraction. The results suggest that salt stress leads to a modification of the QB niche at the acceptor side and an increase in the stability of the S2 state at the donor side, which is associated with a dissociation of the PsbO protein. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Others suggest improving public transit, walking paths and bicycle lanes, as well as providing incentives to people who would use them.

These were a low-productivity grassland, with no history of fertilizer application and a high-productivity grassland with a history of high fertilizer application, referred to as unimproved and improved grassland, respectively. The use of phospholipid fatty acid analysis (PLFA) revealed that the soil of the unimproved grassland had a significantly greater microbial biomass, and a greater abundance of fungi relative to bacteria than did the improved grassland. Soils from both grasslands were maintained at 55% water holding capacity (WHC) or dried to 10% WHC and rewetted to 55% WHC, and then sampled on days 1, 3, 9, 16, 30 and 50 after rewetting. The D/RW stress significantly reduced microbial biomass carbon (C), fungal PLFA and the ratio of fungal-to-bacterial PLFA in both soils. In contrast, D/RW increased microbial activity, but had no effect on total PLFA and bacterial PLFA in either soil. Microbial biomass nitrogen (N) was reduced significantly by D/RW in both soils, but especially in those of the improved grassland. In terms of nutrient leaching, the D/RW stress significantly increased concentrations of dissolved organic C and dissolved organic N in leachates taken from the improved soil only. This treatment increased the concentration of dissolved inorganic N in leachate of both soils, but this effect was most pronounced in the improved soil. Overall, our data show that D/RW stress leads to greater nutrient leaching from improved than from unimproved grassland soils, which have a greater microbial biomass and abundance of fungi relative to bacteria. This finding supports the notion that soils with more fungal-rich communities are better able to retain nutrients under D/RW than are their intensively managed counterparts with lower fungal to bacterial ratios, and that D/RW can enhance nutrient leaching with potential implications for water quality. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The results contribute to understanding how large-scale deployment of CCS might be realised in the UK and the challenges associated therein. The survey revealed that key barriers to implementation of CCS are currently a lack of long-term policy framework in the UK and costs.

N2L 3G1, Canada","In Canada, the Canadian Council of Ministers for the Environment (CCME) is currently engaged in a process to determine how best to reduce air emissions from oil refineries. The National Framework for Petroleum Refineries Emissions Reduction (NFPRER) is being developed with the input of stakeholders, including nongovernment organizations (NGOs), industry, and regulatory jurisdictions. One component of this framework is the development of a tool to prioritize emissions for reduction based on estimated health impacts. HEIDI II (Health Effects Indicators Decision Index II) is a spreadsheet-based model that prioritizes a series of carcinogenic and noncarcinogenic air toxicicants and criteria air contaminants commonly emitted from Canadian oil refineries. A generic meteorological dispersion model was applied to reported annual emissions data for each of Canada's 20 refineries. Photodegradation rates and ambient levels of each substance were accounted for, and air concentrations were calculated for 20 geographic zones around each refinery. These were coupled to toxicity data derived mainly from Health Canada and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and applied to target populations of children, adults and seniors. HEIDI II predicts incidence of relevant disease endpoints from each substance emitted, except for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylene (BTEX) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), which were treated as chemical mixtures. Rankings were based on predicted case incidence or the application of a common health impact metric, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), to the predicted incidence. Using the DALY approach, priority rankings can be made within each of the chemical classes, or across all three classes together. HEIDI II incorporates several switches that allow the user to investigate alternate scenarios based on stack height, average daily sunlight hours (for calculating photodegradation), and the possibility of emissions below regulatory reporting thresholds.

Rocks are generally at low strain and low metamorphic grade, but are often highly deformed and at amphibolite facies grade adjacent to the Cinzento Strike Slip System. The Province has been long recognised for its giant enriched iron and manganese deposits, but over the past 20 years has been increasingly acknowledged as one of the most important Cu-Au and Au-PGE provinces globally, with deposits extending along an approximately 150 km long WNW-trending zone about 60 km wide centred on the Carajás Fault. The larger deposits (approx. 200-1000 Mt @ 0.95-1.4% Cu and 0.3-0.85 g/t Au) are classic Fe-oxide Cu-Au deposits that include Salobo, Igarapé Bahia-Alemão, Cristalino and Sossego. They are largely hosted in the lower volcanic sequences and basement gneisses as pipe- or ring-like mineralised, generally breccia bodies that are strongly Fe- and LREE-enriched, commonly with anomalous Co and U, and quartz- and sulfur-deficient. Iron oxides and Fe-rich carbonates and/or silicates are invariably present. Rhenium-Os dating of molybdenite at Salobo and SHRIMP Pb-Pb dating of hydrothermal monazite at Igarapé-Bahia indicate ages of ca. 2.57 Ga for mineralisation, indistinguishable from ages of poorly-exposed Archean alkalic and A-type intrusions in the Itacaiúnas Belt, strongly implicating a deep magmatic connection. A group of smaller, commonly supergene-enriched Cu-Au deposits (generally &lt; 50 Mt @ &lt; 2% Cu and &lt; 1 g/t Au in hypogene ore), with enrichment in granitophile elements such as W, Sn and Bi, spatially overlap the Archean Fe-oxide Cu-Au deposits. These include the Breves, Águas Claras, Gameleira and Estrela deposits which are largely hosted by the upper sedimentary sequence as greisen-to ring-like or stockwork bodies. They generally lack abundant Fe-oxides, are quartz-bearing and contain more S-rich Cu-Fe sulfides than the Fe-oxide Cu-Au deposits, although Cento e Dezoito (118) appears to be a transitional type of deposit. Precise Pb-Pb in hydrothermal phosphate dating of the Breves and Cento e Dezoito deposits indicate ages of 1872 ± 7 Ma and 1868 ± 7 Ma, respectively, indistinguishable from Pb-Pb ages of zircons from adjacent A-type granites and associated dykes which range from 1874 ± 2 Ma to 1883 ± 2 Ma, with 1878 ± 8 Ma the age of intrusions at Breves. An unpublished Ar/Ar age for hydrothermal biotite at Estrela is indistinguishable, and a Sm-Nd isochron age for Gameleira is also similar, although somewhat younger. The geochronological data, combined with geological constraints and ore-element associations, strongly implicate a magmatic connection for these deposits. The highly anomalous, hydrothermal Serra Pelada Au-PGE deposit lies at the north-eastern edge of the Province within the same fault corridor as the Archean and Paleoproterozoic Cu-Au deposits, and like the Cu-Au deposits is LREE enriched. It appears to have formed from highly oxidising ore fluids that were neutralised by dolomites and reduced by carbonaceous shales in the upper sedimentary succession within the hinge of a reclined synform. The imprecise Pb-Pb in hydrothermal phosphate age of 1861 ± 45 Ma, combined with an Ar/Ar age of hydrothermal biotite of 1882 ± 3 Ma, are indistinguishable from a Pb-Pb in zircon age of 1883 ± 2 Ma for the adjacent Cigano A-type granite and indistinguishable from the age of the Paleoproterozoic Cu-Au deposits. Again a magmatic connection is indicated, particularly as there is no other credible heat or fluid source at that time. Finally, there is minor Au-(Cu) mineralisation associated with the Formiga Granite whose age is probably ca. 600 Ma, although there is little new zircon growth during crystallisation of the granite. This granite is probably related to the adjacent Neoproterozoic (900-600 Ma) Araguaia Fold Belt, formed as part of the Brasiliano Orogeny. Thus, there are two major and one minor period of Cu-Au mineralisation in the Carajás Mineral Province. The two major events display strong REE enrichment and strongly enhanced LREE. There is a trend from strongly Fe-rich, low-SiO2 and low-S deposits to quartz-bearing and more S-rich systems with time. There cannot be significant connate or basinal fluid (commonly invoked in the genesis of Fe-oxide Cu-Au deposits) involved as all host rocks were metamorphosed well before mineralisation: some host rocks are at mid- to high-amphibolite facies. The two major periods of mineralisation correspond to two periods of alkalic to A-type magmatism at ca. 2.57 Ga and ca. 1.88 Ga, and a magmatic association is compelling. The giant to world-class late Archean Fe-oxide Cu-Au deposits show the least obvious association with deep-seated alkaline bodies as shown at Palabora, South Africa, and implied at Olympic Dam, South Australia. The smaller Paleoproterozoic Cu-Au-W-Sn-Bi deposits and Au-PGE deposit show a more obvious relationship to more fractionated A-type granites, and the Neoproterozoic Au-(Cu) deposit to crustally-derived magmas. The available data suggest that magmas and ore fluids were derived from long-lived metasomatised lithosphere and lower crust beneath the eastern margin of the Amazon Craton in a tectonic setting similar to that of other large Precambrian Fe-oxide Cu-Au deposits. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Ecuador 3493, Santiago, Chile","The high particle concentrations that are observed in Santiago de Chile during winter have prompted the government to pursue several approaches to reduce the contamination. One of these strategies was to change the traffic direction, and privileges in several streets. The main avenue (Alameda), which has 5 lanes each way, was segregated such that in three of them, only public buses can circulate and the other two lanes can be used by other vehicles. The objective is that the buses can circulate more freely, thus reducing emissions. During winter of 2001, we have measured the elemental carbon (EC) concentration along Alameda Avenue and several other streets with a light-absorption coefficient equipment built at the University of Santiago. The morning rush hour peak can be seen for all months indicating that the influence of traffic in this area is high. The EC concentration during rush hour represents an average of 25% of the total concentration. In addition, the average in EC concentration (for all months) due to rush hour traffic is higher in the street with no segregated traffic than the other two stations that have segregated traffic. However, the large variability in the data does not allow concluding with statistical significance that there is a reduction in EC pollution during rush hour. The average values of the elemental carbon concentration in 4 stations have been measured, and two of them show high values, the other two show lower values that depend on the location across the city. These results, allow drawing approximately the limits of an area with high elemental carbon concentration.","Diesel emissions; Elemental carbon; Light absorption coefficient; Traffic","absorption coefficient; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon; carbon emission; concentration (composition); emission control; Chile; Metropolitana; Santiago [Metropolitana]; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949198261

This methodology employs data from representative sectors of the fossil-fuel market to determine the temporal (monthly) and spatial (provincial/state) patterns of fuel consumption. These patterns of fuel consumption are then converted to patterns of CO2 emissions. The purpose is to provide a procedure for determining anthropogenic emissions from countries where a full accounting of emissions is impracticable due to limited data availability. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proportional methodology, it is applied to data from the United States (U.S.) and the results are compared to those from an independent methodology that employs a thorough accounting of all fuel sectors. Although there are some discrepancies between the two sets of CO2 emissions estimates, overall, the approaches yield similar results.

Past approaches have indirectly estimated isotopic CO2 exchange using relaxed eddy accumulation, the flask-based isoflux method, and flux-gradient techniques. Eddy covariance (EC) is an attractive method because it has the fewest theoretical assumptions and the potential to give a direct measure of isotopic CO2 flux, but it requires a highly sensitive and relatively fast response instrument. To date, no such field measurements have been reported. Here we describe the use of a closed-path tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy and eddy covariance (EC-TDL) system for isotopic (C16O2, 13CO2, C18O16O) flux measurements. Results are presented from an intensive field experiment conducted over a soybean canopy from 18 July to 20 September 2006. This experiment represents a rigorous field test of the EC-TDL technique because the transport was dominated by relatively high frequency eddies. Net ecosystem CO2 exchange (FN) measured with the EC-TDL system showed strong correlation (r2 = 0.99) in the half-hourly fluxes with an EC open-path infrared gas analyzer (EC-IRGA) over the 60-d period. Net CO2 flux measured with the EC-IRGA and EC-TDL systems agreed to within 9%. Flux loss associated with diminished frequency response beyond 1 Hz for the EC-TDL system was approximately 8% during daytime windy (&gt;4 in s-1) conditions. There was no significant evidence of a kinetic-type fractionation effect related to a phase shift among isotopologues due to tube attenuation. Investigation of isotopic spectral similarity in the flux ratio (δNx) for both 13CO2 and C18O16O transport showed that δNx was relatively independent of eddy scale for this ecosystem type. Flux loss, therefore, did not significantly bias δNx. There was excellent agreement between isofluxes (Fδx) measured using the flux-gradient and eddy covariance methods. Application of the EC-TDL technique over rougher surfaces or below canopy, where the flux-gradient approach is difficult to apply, appears promising for obtaining continuous long-term measurements of isotopic CO2 exchange.

In recent years, significant progress has been made in understanding the environmental and physiological controls on isoprenoid emission and in scaling these emissions to canopy and landscape levels. We summarize recent developments and compare different approaches for simulating volatile isoprenoid emission and scaling up to whole forest canopies with complex architecture. We show that the current developments in modeling volatile isoprenoid emissions are ""split-ended"" with simultaneous but separated efforts in fine-tuning the empirical emission algorithms and in constructing process-based models. In modeling volatile isoprenoid emissions, simplified leaf-level emission algorithms (Guenther algorithms) are highly successful, particularly after scaling these models up to whole regions, where the influences of different ecosystem types, ontogenetic stages, and variations in environmental conditions on emission rates and dynamics partly cancel out. However, recent experimental evidence indicates important environmental effects yet unconsidered and emphasize, the importance of a highly dynamic plant acclimation in space and time. This suggests that current parameterizations are unlikely to hold in a globally changing and dynamic environment. Therefore, long-term predictions using empirical algorithms are not necessarily reliable. We show that process-based models have large potential to capture the influence of changing environmental conditions, in particular if the leaf models are linked with physiologically based whole-plant models. This combination is also promising in considering the possible feedback impacts of emissions on plant physiological status such as mitigation of thermal and oxidative stresses by volatile isoprenoids. It might be further worth while to incorporate main features of these approaches in regional empirically-based emission estimations thereby merging the ""split ends"". © 2008 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","BVOC emission; Isoprenoids; Modeling; Scaling; Spatial variability; Temporal variability","aerosol formation; algorithm; biogenic emission; ecological modeling; environmental conditions; estimation method; isoprenoid; ozone; spatial variation; temporal variation; volatile substance; terpene; biological model; chemistry; ecosystem; metabolism; plant; review; time; volatilization; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Plants; Terpenes; Time Factors; Volatilization",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41649098070

Weekly or biweekly water samples from the inflow and outflow regions of 11 test cells (2,000 m2) were analyzed for various forms of P and other selected water quality variables between January 2002 and August 2004. Test cells located at the north site received water with a high average total P (TP) concentration (72 μg L-1), while test cells located at the south site received water with a lower average TP concentration (43 μg L-1). These test cells were dominated by an emergent vascular plant-cattail (Typha latifolia), submerged aquatic vegetation or SAV (Najas guadalupensis, Chara sp., Ceratophyllum demersum, and Hydrilla verticillata), or algal periphyton (mixed with Eleocharis cellulosa and Utricularia spp. in the south site only). Under a constant hydraulic loading rate (9.27 in yr-1), these test cells removed P effectively, with removal efficiencies of 56%-65% at the north site and 35%-62% at the south site. The mass removal rate and rate constant at the north site were also higher than at the south site. Soluble reactive P (SRP) and particulate P were the major forms at inflow and were removed effectively by all of the test cells. The removal of dissolved organic P was significant (∼60%) in the cattail and periphyton test cells, but no removal was detected in the SAV test cells. At the north site, P removal efficiency of the cattail test cells was slightly higher than that of the SAV test cells. At the south site, periphyton test cells were the best performers. The removal of SRP was positively correlated with the removal of calcium in the majority of the test cells, pointing to the potential importance of co-precipitation of calcium carbonate and SRP. Direct plant uptake, wetland filtering, microbial degradation, and co-precipitation with calcium carbonate were mechanisms thought to be responsible for P removal in these wetlands. Outflow TP concentration, an important measure for restoration performance, increased continuously with the increases in the TP mass loading rate at the north site, but peaked at approximately 30 μg L-1 when the TP mass loading rate reached 0.5 g m-2 yr-1 at the south site. © 2008, The Society of Wetland Scientists.","Calcium; Cattail; Hydraulic loading rate; Periphyton-based stormwater treatment area; Removal efficiency; Submerged aquatic vegetation; Test cells; Total phosphorus","calcium; constructed wetland; phosphorus; plant community; submerged vegetation; vascular plant; water quality; Florida [United States]; North America; United States; algae; Ceratophyllum demersum; Chara; Eleocharis; Eleocharis cellulosa; Hydrilla verticillata; Najas guadalupensis; Tracheophyta; Typha; Typha latifolia; Utricularia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-55949094852

The underlying hypothesis is that mild winters and warm, early springs, which are expected to occur as the climate warms, may induce premature plant development, resulting in exposure of vulnerable plant tissues and organs to subsequent late-season frosts. The 2007 spring freeze in the eastern United States provides an excellent opportunity to evaluate this hypothesis and assess its large-scale consequences. In this article, we contrast the rapid prefreeze phenological advancement caused by unusually warm conditions with the dramatic postfreeze setback, and report complicated patterns of freeze damage to plants. The widespread devastation of crops and natural vegetation occasioned by this event demonstrates the need to consider large fluctuations in spring temperatures a real threat to terrestrial ecosystem structure and functioning in a warming climate. © 2008 American Institute of Biological Sciences.","Carbon cycle; Climate warming; Extreme temperature fluctuation; Frost damage; Plant phenology",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41649083365

Analysis of the benefits of these policies in terms of reduced climate change impacts has been limited. The currently available analytical tools have a limited capacity to estimate both the economic impacts of climate change and the potential to reduce likely economic damages through either mitigation or adaptation. • abare in collaboration with CSIRO has developed a preliminary version of a 'global integrated assessment model' (GIAM) to fill this gap in analytical capacity. GIAM allows feedbacks and interactions between climate and economic systems and has the capacity to provide detailed information about the physical and economic impacts of climate change. • Development of this analytical capacity is particularly relevant as Australia and many other countries are moving or planning to move toward policy measures designed to address the impacts of climate change, including emissions trading schemes and adaptation measures. • Using GIAM, an illustrative long run 'reference case' (to 2100) of global and regional economic activity with climate change impacts, in the absence of mitigation and planned adaptation measures, is developed. • It is important to recognise the preliminary and illustrative nature of the analysis reported here. Additional work is needed to understand better the extent of climate change impacts and to further improve the analysis.",,"adaptation; climate change; economic impact; emissions trading; environmental assessment; environmental economics; integrated approach; mitigation; modeling; trade-environment relations; Australasia; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41149117909

In many Nordic municipalities the European environmental quality standard for inhalable particles (PM10) is exceeded due to these particles. In this study, particles from the wear of studded and studless friction tyres on two pavements and traction sanding were generated using a road simulator. The particles were characterized using particle sizers, Particle Induced X-Ray Emission Analysis and electron microscopy. Cell studies were conducted on particles sampled from the tests with studded tyres and compared with street environment, diesel exhaust and subway PM10, respectively. The results show that in the road simulator, where resuspension is minimized, studded tyres produce tens of times more particles than friction tyres. Chemical analysis of the sampled particles shows that the generated wear particles consist almost entirely of minerals from the pavement stone material, but also that Sulfur is enriched for the submicron particles and that Zink is enriched for friction tyres for all particles sizes. The chemical data can be used for source identification and apportionment in urban aerosol studies. A mode of ultra-fine particles was also present and is hypothesised to originate in the tyres. Further, traction material properties affect PM10 emission. The inflammatory potential of the particles from wear of pavements seems to depend on type of pavement and can be at least as potent as diesel exhaust particles. The results imply that there is a need and a good potential to reduce particle emission from pavement wear and winter time road and street operation by adjusting both studded tyre use as well as pavement and traction material properties. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Black auroras typically appear post-magnetic midnight and during the substorm recovery phase, but not exclusively so. We report on the first combined multimonochromatic optical imaging, bistatic white-light TV recordings and incoherent scatter radar observations of black aurora by EISCAT of the phenomenon. From the relatively larger reduction in luminosity at 4278 Å than at 8446 Å we show that nonsheared black auroras are most probably not caused by downward directed electrical fields at low altitude. From the observations, we determine this by relating the height and intensity of the black aurora to precipitating particle energy within the surrounding background diffuse aurora. The observations are more consistent with an energy selective loss cone. Hence the mechanism causing black aurora is most probably active in the magnetosphere rather than close to Earth.

According to the distribution of these isotopes in the above systems, two types of microbial methane are recognized in the Earth's crust: (1) resulting from CO2 reduction and (2) produced through acetate fermentation. In the case of methane 1, the biologic distribution of hydrogen and carbon isotopes in the above systems corresponds to the thermodynamic isotope exchange equilibrium at a given temperature of the methane genesis medium. In the case of methane 2, the same systems show mainly a nonequilibrium distribution of these isotopes. We have revealed a linear relationship between the isotopic compositions of CH4, H2O, and CO2: δD(CH4) = αDbDδD(H2O) + b and δ13C(CH4) = αCbCδ13C(CO2) + d, where αDb and αCb are the general factors of biologic nonequilibrium fractionation of hydrogen and carbon isotopes, respectively, in the systems CH4-H2O and CH4-CO2. These factors are determined from the equations 103 ln αDb = -477.357(106/T2) + 3458.55 and 103 ln αCb = -277.954(106/T2) + 1988.677, where T(K) is the temperature of the acetate methanogenic medium. The values of αDb and αCb do not depend (in contrast to the values of b and d) on the kind of bacteria and the temperature of the methane genesis medium. Based on thermodynamic data, we proposed a model for the formation of the isotopic composition of microbial methane in nature. Variations in the hydrogen and carbon isotope compositions of microbial methane in various geologic objects are due mainly to the variations in the temperature of the methanogenic medium and the mixing (in different proportions) of methane 1 with methane 2. The portions of acetate fermentation methane in the total balance of microbial methane in different geologic objects vary over a wide range of values: 52 to 100% in marine deposits of Cape Lookout Bight, North Carolina, US; 65 to 100% in surface fresh waters of Lake Wuermsee, Germany; and 35% in Lake Kivu, East Central Africa. © 2008.","geochemistry; Isotopes; microbial methane genesis","carbon isotope; crustal structure; fermentation; hydrogen isotope; isotopic fractionation; methane; methanogenesis; methanogenic bacterium; modeling; Cape Lookout Bight; North America; North Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43649101026

Root/shoot biomass ratio was increased in severely Fe-deficient plants grown in hydroponics but not under moderate Fe limitation in soil culture. Significantly increased biomass production in high CO2 treatments, even under severe Fe deficiency in hydroponic culture, indicates an improved inrernal Fe utilization. Iron deficiency-induced secretion of PS in 0.5 to 2.5 cm sub-apical root zones was increased by 74% in response to elevated CO2 tteatments of barley plants in hydroponics but no PS were detectable in root exudates collected from soil-grown plants. This may be attributed to suppression of PS release by internal Fe concentrations above the critical level for Fe deficiency, determined at final harvest for soil-grown barley plants, even without additional Fe supply. However, extremely low concentrations of easily plant-available Fe in the investigated soil and low Fe seed reserves suggest a contribution of PS-mediated Fe mobilization from sparingly soluble Fe sources to Fe acquisition of the soil-grown barley plants during the preceding culture period. Higher Fe contents in shoots (+52%) of plants grown in soil culture without Fe supply under elevated atmospheric CO2 concenttations may indicate an increased efficiency for Fe acquisition.

We studied the abundance and function of the soil microbial community at two levels of spatial resolution to assess the response of microorganisms in the rhizosphere of the whole root system and of apical root zones of Phaseolus vulgaris L. to elevated CO2 and high or low N supply. At the coarser resolution, microbial biomass C, basal respiration and phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) patterns in the rhizosphere remained unaffected by elevated CO2, because the C flux from the whole root system into soil did not change [as shown by Haase, S., Neumann, G., Kania, A., Kuzyakov, Y., Römheld, V., Kandeler, E., 2007. Elevation of atmospheric CO2 and N-nutritional status modify nodulation, nodule carbon supply, and root exudation of Phaseolus vulgaris L. Soil Biology &amp; Biochemistry 39, 2208-2221]. At a higher spatial resolution, more low-molecular-weight compounds were released from apical root zones under elevated CO2. Thus, at an early stage of plant growth (12 days after sowing), elevated CO2 induced an increase of enzyme activities (xylosidase, cellobiosidase and leucine-aminopeptidase) in the rhizosphere soil of apical root zones. At later stages of plant growth (21 days after sowing), however, enzyme activities (those above as well as N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase and phosphatase) decreased under elevated CO2. The abundance of total and denitrifying bacteria in the rhizosphere soil of apical root zones was unaffected by CO2 elevation or N supply. Plant age seemed to be the main factor influencing the density of the bacterial community.

The signature of this seasonal CO2 cycle has been detected in surface pressure measurements from the Viking and Pathfinder landers. The amount of CO2 that condenses during fall and winter is controlled by the net polar energy loss, which is dominated by emitted infrared radiation from the cap itself. However, models of the CO2 cycle match the surface pressure data only if the emitted radiation is artificially suppressed suggesting that they are missing a heat source. Here we show that the missing heat source is the conducted energy coming from soil that contains water ice very close to the surface. The presence of ice significantly increases the thermal conductivity of the ground such that more of the solar energy absorbed at the surface during summer is conducted downward into the ground where it is stored and released back to the surface during fall and winter thereby retarding the CO2 condensation rate. The reduction in the condensation rate is very sensitive to the depth of the soil/ice interface, which our models suggest is about 8 cm in the Northern Hemisphere and 11 cm in the Southern Hemisphere. This is consistent with the detection of significant amounts of polar ground ice by the Mars Odyssey Gamma Ray Spectrometer and provides an independent means for assessing how close to the surface the ice must be. Our results also provide an accurate determination of the global annual mean size of the atmosphere and cap CO2 reservoirs, which are, respectively, 6.1 and 0.9 hPa. They also indicate that general circulation models will need to account for the effect of ground ice in their simulations of the seasonal CO2 cycle. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The present contribution gives an overview of the history of GHG emission regulation in Austria and identifies the progress made towards the realization of the national climate strategy to attain the GHG emission targets. The contribution uses Austria as an example of the way in which proper waste management can help to reduce GHG emissions. The GHG inventories show that everything must be done to minimize the carbon input due to waste deposition at landfill sites. The incineration of waste is particularly helpful in reducing GHG emissions. The waste-to-energy by incineration plants and recovery of energy yield an ecologically proper treatment of waste using state-of-the-art techniques of a very high standard. The potential for GHG reduction of conventional waste treatment technologies has been estimated by the authors. A growing number of waste incinerators and intensified co-incineration of waste in Austrian industry will both help to reduce national GHG emissions substantially. By increasing the number and capacity of plants for thermal treatment of waste the contribution of proper waste management to the national target for reduction of GHG emissions will be in the range of 8 to 14%. The GHG inventories also indicate that a potential CO2 reduction of about 500 000 t year-1 is achievable by co-incineration of waste in Austrian industry. © ISWA 2008.","Austrian climate strategy; GHG emissions; Kyoto target; Waste management; Wmr 1323-5","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Carbon dioxide reduction; Climate protection; Waste management; carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Waste disposal; Waste incineration; Waste management; emission control; greenhouse gas; incineration; Kyoto Protocol; waste management; waste treatment; article; Austria; carbon source; climate change; electricity; energy recovery; energy yield; European Union; greenhouse gas; heat; incineration; industrial waste; landfill; methodology; municipal solid waste; practice guideline; priority journal; solid waste management; Austria; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Incineration; Refuse Disposal; Vehicle Emissions; Waste Management; Austria; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39649118612

These fluxes are the production of aboveground litter and root litter, and decomposition of the soil organic matter (SOM) pool by soil microorganisms. Knowledge about the temperature sensitivity of the decomposition of different SOM fractions is crucial in order to understand how climate change might affect carbon storage in soils. In this study, the temperature sensitivity of the turnover times of three different SOM fractions (labile, intermediate, and stabilized) was investigated for 11 forest sites along a temperature gradient. Carbon-14 isotope analyses of the SOM fractions combined with a model provided estimates of their turnover times. The turnover times of the labile SOM fraction were not correlated with mean annual soil temperature. Therefore it was not possible to estimate temperature sensitivity for the labile SOM fraction. Given considerable evidence elsewhere for significant temperature sensitivities of labile SOM, lack of temperature sensitivity here most likely indicates limitations of the applied methodology for the labile SOM fraction. The turnover times of the intermediate and the stabilized SOM fractions were both correlated with mean annual soil temperatures. The temperature sensitivity of the stabilized SOM fraction was at least equal to that of the intermediate SOM fraction and possibly more than twice as high. A correction for confounding effects of soil acidity and clay content on the temperature sensitivities of the intermediate and stabilized SOM fractions was included in the analysis. The results as observed here for the three SOM fractions may have been influenced by (1) modeling assumptions for the estimation of SOM turnover times of leaf and needle longevities, constant annual carbon inputs, and steady-state SOM pools, (2) the occurrence of summer drought at some sites, (3) differences between sites in quality of the SOM fractions, or (4) the relatively small temperature range. Our results suggested that a 1°C increase in temperature could lead to decreases in turnover times of 4-11% and 8-16%, for the intermediate and stabilized SOM fractions, respectively. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","14C; Climate-change relevance; Decomposition of SOM; Density fractionation; Forest sites, southern Italian Alps; Litter; Soil organic carbon; Soil organic matter (SOM); Temperature gradient; Temperature sensitivity of decomposition; Turnover time","organic compound; carbon isotope; carbon sequestration; climate change; decomposition; litter; sensitivity analysis; soil organic matter; soil temperature; temperature gradient; turnover; article; soil; temperature; tree; Organic Chemicals; Soil; Temperature; Trees; Alps; Eurasia; Europe; Italy; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149176619

The calibration protocol individually compensated for the progressive drift of calibration parameters, whereby sensor precision and accuracy, as well as applicable lifetime were improved. A severely reduced photoacidity was observed for the immobilized fluorophore, for which excited state dynamics was characterized and benefited from during measurements. Due to the significantly reduced photoacidity of HPTS immobilized in the ethyl-cellulose sensing membrane, a dual excitation/dual emission (F1, ex/em: 405/440 nm and F2, ex/em: 465/510 nm) ratiometric (RF1, F2 = F1/F2) sensing scheme could be used to amplify sensor response. The signal to noise (S/N) ratio was enhanced by ∼400% utilizing the dual excitation/dual emission ratiometric sensing scheme, rather than the more commonly used protocol of dual excitation/single emission for HPTS fluorescence. Apparent pKa of the fluorophore ranged from 6.74 to 8.50, mainly determined by the immobilization procedure. The repeatability (IUPAC, pooled standard deviation) over three pH values (6.986, 7.702 and 7.828) was 0.0044 pH units for the optical sensor, compared to 0.0046 for the electrode used for standardization.

However, constraints on its oceanographic history preceding the Quaternary (the past 1.8Myr) have become available only recently, because of the difficulties associated with obtaining continuous sediment records in such a hostile setting. Here, we use the neodymium isotope compositions of two sediment cores recovered near the North Pole to reconstruct over the past 15Myr the sources contributing to Arctic Intermediate Water, a water mass found today at depths of 200 to 1,500m. We interpret high neodymium ratios for the period between 15 and 2 Myr ago, and for the glacial periods thereafter, as indicative of weathering input from the Siberian Putoranan basalts into the Arctic Ocean. Arctic Intermediate Water was then derived from brine formation in the Eurasian shelf regions, with only a limited contribution of intermediate water from the North Atlantic. In contrast, the modern circulation pattern, with relatively high contributions of North Atlantic Intermediate Water and negligible input from brine formation, exhibits low neodymium isotope ratios and is typical for the interglacial periods of the past 2Myr. We suggest that changes in climatic conditions and the tectonic setting were responsible for switches between these two modes. © 2008 Nature Publishing Group.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44549087397

To determine the 137Cs deposition density, undisturbed soil profiles were taken from 23 environments situated between the latitudes of 02°N and 30°S. Sampling sites located along to the equator exhibited 137Cs deposition densities with an average value of 219 Bq m-2. Extremely low deposition densities of 1.3 Bq m-2 were found in the Amazon region. In contrast, the southern part of Brazil, located between latitudes of 20°S and 34°S, exhibited considerably higher deposition densities ranging from 140 Bq m-2 to 1620 Bq m-2. To examine the 137Cs soil-to-plant transfer in the Brazilian agricultural products, 29 mainly tropical plant species, and corresponding soil samples were collected at 43 sampling locations in nine federal states of Brazil. Values of the 137Cs concentration factor plant/soil exhibited a large range from 0.020 (beans) to 6.2 (cassava). Samples of some plant species originated from different collecting areas showed different concentration factors. The 137Cs content of some plants collected was not measurable due to a very low 137Cs concentration level found in the upper layers of the incremental soils. Globally, the soil-to-plant transfer of 137Cs can be described by a logarithmic normal distribution with a geometric mean of 0.3 and a geometric standard deviation of 3.9. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

These events were found by searching the 6-12 keVenergy range (see Paper I) and are small active region flares, from low (GOES) C class to below A class. Each microflare is automatically analyzed at the peak time of the 6-12 keV emission: the thermal source size is found by forward-fitting the complex visibilities for 4-8 keV, and the spectral parameters (temperature, emission measure, power-law index) are found by forward-fitting a thermal plus nonthermal model. The resulting wealth of information we determine about the events allows a range of the thermal and nonthermal properties to be investigated. In particular, we find that there is no correlation between the thermal loop size and the flare magnitude, indicating that microflares are not necessarily spatially small. We present the first thermal energy distribution of RHESSI flares and compare it to previous thermal energy distributions of transient events. We also present the first nonthermal power distribution of RHESSIflares and find that a few microflares have unexpectedly large nonthermal powers up to 1028 erg s-1. The total microflare nonthermal energy, however, is still small compared to that of large flares as it occurs for shorter durations. These large energies and difficulties in analyzing the steep nonthermal spectra suggest that a sharp broken power law and thick-target bremsstrahlung model may not be appropriate for microflares. © 2008.

We describe a novel 3-dimensional (3D) gated blood pool single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) approach, from which a contraction homogeneity index (CHI) is derived and compared with planar phase analyses. Methods and Results: Subjects underwent planar and SPECT blood pool acquisition. Planar images were processed for left ventricular ejection fraction computation and phase values. SPECT images were processed by our novel algorithm, with which CHI was computed. Overall, 235 patients (79% male; mean age, 62 ± 11 years) completed the study. Left ventricular ejection fractions were similar by planar (33.5% ± 13.5%) and 3D (34.7% ± 12.7%) methods (r = 0.83, P < .0001). Mean phase angles for planar and tomographic methods were 126.3° ± 29.6° and 124.4° ± 28.7°, respectively (r = 0.53, P < .0001). Phase and amplitude signals were incorporated in the CHI, which was non-normally distributed with a median of 73.8% (interquartile range, 58.7%-84.9%). This index minimized the negative impact of dyskinetic wall segments with limited regional motion. The planar heterogeneity index (SDΦ) was 28.2° (interquartile range, 17.5°-46.8°) and correlated inversely with CHI (r = -0.61, P < .0001). Conclusion: The novel 3D dispersion index CHI accounts for both phase delay of a dyssynchronous segment and its magnitude of contraction and is moderately correlated with planar phase analyses. Its potential in cardiac resynchronization therapy remains to be exploited. © 2008 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.","cardiac resynchronization therapy; Contraction homogeneity index; single photon emission computed tomography gated blood pool imaging","amerscan; methoxy isobutyl isonitrile technetium tc 99m; stannous pyrophosphate; unclassified drug; adult; algorithm; article; blood pool scintiscanning; cardiac resynchronization therapy; comparative study; controlled study; correlation analysis; diagnostic imaging; diagnostic procedure; female; gated imaging; heart contraction; heart left ventricle contraction; heart left ventricle ejection fraction; human; image processing; major clinical study; male; priority journal; signal processing; single photon emission computer tomography; three dimensional imaging",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38649143696

CaCO3 could be added to the surface layer in regions where the depth of the boundary between supersaturated and unsaturated water is relatively shallow (250-500 m) and where the upwelling velocity is large (30-300 m a-1). The CaCO3 would dissolve within a few 100 m depth below the saturation horizon, and the dissolution products would enter the mixed layer within a few years to decades, facilitating further absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere. This absorption of CO2 would largely offset the increase in mixed layer pH and carbonate supersaturation resulting from the upwelling of dissolved limestone powder. However, if done on a large scale, the reduction in atmospheric CO2 due to absorption of CO2 by the ocean would reduce the amount of CO2 that needs to be absorbed by the mixed layer, thereby allowing a larger net increase in pH and in supersaturation in the regions receiving CaCO3. At the same time, the reduction in atmospheric pCO2 would cause outgassing of CO2 from ocean regions not subject to addition of CaCO3, thereby increasing the pH and supersaturation in these regions as well. Geographically optimal application of 4 billion t of CaCO3 a-1 (0.48 Gt C a-1) could induce absorption of atmospheric CO2 at a rate of 600 Mt CO2 a-1 after 50 years, 900 Mt CO2 a-1 after 100 years, and 1050 Mt CO2 a-1 after 200 years.

Yet minimal amounts of charred plant remains and abundant noncharred material occur in various K-P boundary locations across North America. This refutes the inference that wild. fires occurred on a global scale, and requires an alternative explanation for the aciniform soot. Here we describe significant concentrations of carbon cenospheres in K-P boundary sediments from New Zealand, Demnark, and Canada. Carbon cenospheres are thought to derive solely from incomplete combustion of pulverized coal or fuel-oil droplets, which suggests that the impact may have combusted organic-rich target crust. The Chicxulub impact crater is located adjacent to the Cantaretl oil reservoir, one of the most productive off fields on Earth. This indicates that abundance of organic carbon in the Chicxulub target crust was likely to have been above global mean values. But even if we discount Chicxulub's organic-rich locality, the global mean crustal abundance for fossil organic matter is more than adequate to account for observed concentrations of both carbon cenospheres and aciniform soot, therefore making the global wildfire hypothesis unnecessary. © 2008 The Geological Society of America.","Aciniform; Anthropogenic pollutants; Ash; Cretaceous-paleogene; Cretaceous-tertiary boundary; Extinction; Fire; Impacts; K-T; Kerogen; Soot","bolide impact; Elevated concentrations; Forest wildfires; Fossil organic matters; Paleogene; Sedimentation; Organic compounds; carbon dioxide; combustion; Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary; extinction; fossil; organic carbon; organic matter; paleoenvironment; Paleogene; plant; soot; warming; wildfire",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46149109882

Physiological characteristics of the N2O emitter in the soilless culture system, including responses to soil environments, substrate concentration, C-source concentration, pH, and temperature, suggest that the N2O emitting Janthinobacterium sp. strain A1-13 is highly adapted to reclaimed open peatland and primarily responsible for massive N2O emissions from the acidic peat soils.

This can be achieved using compositional reservoir simulations. However, sophisticated equations of state (EOS) approaches used in current compositional simulators are computationally expensive. It is advantageous and possible to use a simple, but accurate fluid model for the very specific case of geological CO2 storage. Using a black-oil simulation approach, the computational burden of flow simulation can be reduced significantly. In this work, an efficient and simple algorithm is developed for converting compositional data from EOS into black-oil PVT data. Our algorithm is capable of predicting CO2-brine density, solubility, and formation volume factor, which are all necessary for black-oil flow simulations of CO2 storage in geological formations. Numerical simulations for a simple CO2 storage case demonstrate that the black-oil simulation runs are at least four times faster than the compositional ones without loss of accuracy. The accuracy in prediction of CO2-brine black-oil PVT properties and higher computational efficiency of the black-oil approach promote application of black-oil simulation for large-scale geological storage of CO2 in saline aquifers. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The area covers Central and Northern Europe, adjacent sea-areas and Greenland. The GCM data were provided from the Max Planck Institute, Germany (MPI), the Hadley Centre, U.K. (HC), the Bjerknes Centre, Norway (BCCR) and University of Oslo, Norway (UiO). The resulting ensemble covers a range of future climate realizations from different global models, different greenhouse gas scenarios and natural climate variability. In order to present trends in statistical parameters including extreme events and their return periods, the downscaled response data are combined as an ensemble of equally valid possible realizations. The combined statistics is obtained after adjustments accounting for (i) different set-ups of the respective GCMs in producing the control climate and (ii) the variable range of time between the control and scenario periods. We find that annual extreme events of daily precipitation and wind speed in the control climate become more frequent in the scenario period over large areas in Northern Europe.

We present a new approach for national assessments of the environmental impact of an agricultural sector. Emission estimates are combined with a country-specific set of indicators to assess the environmental impact in nine regions with specific environmental characteristics. We estimate the contribution of emissions of ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen oxides (NO) to acidification and terrestrial eutrophication, nitrate (NO3) and phosphate (PO4) to aquatic eutrophication, nitrogen oxides (NO), particulate matter (PM10) and (PM2.5) to human toxicity and methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (NO) to global warming. We present large regional differences in the environmental and health impact per unit of agricultural production. The regional acidifying, eutrophying and global warming impact of dairy cattle is calculated to be up to three times the national average, depending on the dairy cattle intensity. Aquatic eutrophication is found to be a problem in regions with relatively high eutrophying emissions per hectare of so-called nitrate vulnerable zones. Human toxicity problems caused by dairy cattle livestock and manure management are problematic in regions with a high population density in rural areas. The strength of our approach is the use of country-specific characterisation factors to assess the potential environmental and health impact of agriculture at the sub-national scale. We were able to analyse the potential environmental impact without explicit quantification of specific effects on humans and ecosystems. The results can be used to identify the most polluted areas as well as appropriate targets for emission reduction. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We examined the effects of soil temperature (14, 20, 26 °C) on the structure and extent of a multispecies community of arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi associated with Plantago lanceolata. To isolate fungi from roots, we used a mesh-divided pot system with separate hyphal compartments near and away from the plant. A 13C pulse label was then used to trace the flow of recently fixed photosynthate from plants into belowground pools and respiration. Temperature significantly altered the structure and allocation of the AM hyphal network, with a switch from more vesicles (storage) in cooled soils to more extensive extraradical hyphal networks (growth) in warmed soils. As soil temperature increased, we also observed an increase in the speed at which plant photosynthate was transferred to and respired by roots and AM fungi coupled with an increase in the amount of carbon respired per unit hyphal length. These differences were largely independent of plant size and rates of photosynthesis. In a warmer world, we would therefore expect more carbon losses to the atmosphere from AM fungal respiration, which are unlikely to be balanced by increased growth of AM fungal hyphae. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","13C pulse label; Carbon cycle; Climate change; Extraradical mycelia; Plantago lanceolata; Root length colonization; Soil respiration","carbon cycle; climate change; colonization; community response; community structure; fungus; growth response; root; soil biota; soil respiration; soil temperature; temperature effect; Arbuscular; Fungi; Plantago; Plantago lanceolata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42949140806

Methods: We developed a bog ecosystem model that includes vegetation, carbon, nitrogen and water dynamics. Two groups of vascular plant species and three groups of Sphagnum species compete with each other for light and nitrogen. The model was tested by comparing the outcome with long-term historic vegetation changes in peat cores from Denmark and England. A climate scenario was used to analyse the future effects of atmospheric CO2, temperature and precipitation. Results: The main changes in the species composition since 1766 were simulated by the model. Simulations for a future wanner, and slightly wetter, climate with doubling CO2 concentration suggest that little will change in species composition, due to the contrasting effects of increasing temperatures (favouring vascular plants) and CO2 (favouring Sphagnum). Further analysis of the effects of temperature showed that simulated carbon sequestration is negatively related to vascular plant expansion. Model results show that increasing temperatures may still increase carbon accumulation at cool, low N deposition sites, but decrease carbon accumulation at high N deposition sites. Conclusions: Our results show that the effects of temperature, precipitation, N-deposition and atmospheric CO2 are not straightforward, but interactions between these components of global change exist. These interactions are the result of changes in vegetation composition. When analysing long-term effects of global change, vegetation changes should be taken into account and predictions should not be based on temperature increase alone. © IAVS; Opuius Press Uppsala.","Carbon cycling; Competition; Ecosystem model; Global change; NUCOM-BOG; Ombrotrophic peatland; Palaeoecology; Species effect; Sphagnum; Vegetation composition","carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; community composition; ecosystem modeling; global change; moss; peatland; vegetation; Denmark; England; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; United Kingdom; Western Europe; Sphagnum; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41849115693

Field studies included air from inside a compost heap of about 200 m3, emissions from composting of livestock wastes at a biologically operating farm, and leaf litter pile air samples. The concentration of CO was up to 120 μmol mol-1 in the compost piles of green waste, and up to 10 μmol mol-1 in flux chambers above livestock waste windrow composts. The mean CO flux rates were approximately 20 mg CO m-2 h-1 for compost heaps of green waste, and varied from 30 to 100 mg CO m-2 h-2 for fresh dung windrows. Laboratory studies using a temperature and ventilation-controlled substrate container were performed to elucidate the origin of CO, and included hay samples of fixed moisture content at temperatures between 5 and 65°C including nonsterilized as well as sterilized samples. The concentration of CO was up to 160 μmol mol -1 in these experiments, and Arrhenius-type plot analyses resulted in activation energies of 65 kJ mol-1 for thermochemically produced CO from the nonsterilized compost substrate. Sterilized samples showed dramatically reduced CO2 but virtually unchanged CO emissions, albeit at a slightly lower activation energy, likely a result of the high-temperature sterilization. Though globally and regionally these CO emissions ate only a minor source, thermochemically produced CO emissions might affect local air quality in and near composting facilities.

Methane-related carbonate build-ups, found on the NW' Black Sea shelf are part of an unique microbial ecosystem. Two archaeal guilds are mainly responsible for the AOM: ANME-1 (anaerobic-methane-oxidizing communities)/DSS consortia and ANME-2/greigite-bearing DSS-consortia. These microorganisms constitute a significant sink of methane on earth, but despite their relevance for the global carbon cycle little is known about the biology of AOM. Phylogenetic and biochemical analyses suggested that ANME-archaea have supposedly reversed the methanogenic pathway. Here, we were able to localize methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR), which catalyzes the final step of the methane formation, in ultrathin sections. The result was obtained by the immunogold labeling technique using a specific antiserum against the MCR. This technique revealed that the MCR is located in both ANME-1- and ANME-2-archaea. The data also show that MCR-like enzymes are not only encoded in the genomes of ANME-1 and ANME-2, but are, in fact, expressed as cellular proteins at high levels.","Anaerobic oxidation of methane; ANME-1; ANME-2; Black Sea; Cold methane seeps; Immunogold labeling technique; Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (E.C. 2.8.4.1); Sulphate-reducing bacteria","carbon cycle; enzyme; genome; methane; microbial community; microorganism; oxidation; phylogenetics; sulfate-reducing bacterium; Black Sea; Eurasia; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46249128311

Due to the high-ranking value given to economic thinking in many Swedish contexts, economic arguments are perfect ways to win an argument or negotiation, to prevent risks of losing credibility, or to discredit others. As illustrated in this article, legitimacy-creating acts of communication tend to precede or follow upon a decision to install a solar heating system. An immediate and massive use of solar energy for heating purposes would mitigate the risks of global warming and depletion of energy resources. Unfortunately however, the conspicuous use of economic arguments accompanying solar heating installations tends to be interpreted by policy-makers as a preference for economic motives rather than a sign of questioned consumption. The illusion that economy is an objective entity rising above all other social issues seems to be confirmed, and political measures based on economic thinking can continue to block adequate steps towards the mitigation of climate changing emissions. The cultural representation of economic sovereignty is continuously reproduced through communication.

We examined the decomposition of both shaded and sun-exposed litter over summer and inferred the effects of photodegradation from changes in mass loss and litter chemistry. The carry-over effects of summer litter exposure on wet season decomposition were also assessed, and the attenuation of photodegradation with litter layer thickness was used to estimate the proportion of grass litter lignin susceptible to photodegradation under different treatments of a factorial global change experiment. Over summer, mass loss from grass and forb litter exposed to ambient sunlight ranged from 8% to 10%, whereas lignin decreased in grass litter by approximately 20%. After one year of decomposition, mass losses from grass leaves exposed to sunlight over summer were more than double the mass losses from summer-shaded leaves. When shade litter layer thickness was varied, mass losses over summer for all treatments were also approximately 8%; however, lignin decreased significantly only in the low shade treatments (0-64 g m-2 of shade litter). Aboveground production of annual grasses nearly quadrupled in response to the combined effects of N addition, elevated atmospheric CO2, increased precipitation and warming. The estimated proportion of grass litter lignin experiencing full photodegradation ranged from 100% under ambient conditions to 31-62% in plots receiving the combined global change treatments. These results reveal an important role of sun exposure over summer in accelerating litter decomposition in these grasslands and provide evidence that future changes in the quantity of litter deposition may modulate the influence of photodegradation integrated across the litter layer. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Decomposition; Grass; Lignin; Litter; Photodegradation; Shade; Sunlight; UV-B","carbon dioxide; decomposition; grassland; lignin; litter; photodegradation; shading; solar radiation; ultraviolet B radiation; California; North America; United States; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45049084904

These strategies have led to very fast combustion processes as a consequence of the improvement on the fuel atomization, evaporation, and air entrainment phenomena. Although NOx emissions models for diesel engines usually assume equilibrium and/or the steady state hypothesis together with the consideration of very simplified kinetic reaction mechanisms (such as the Lavoie method based on the extended Zeldovich reaction mechanism), modem diesel engine combustion models require more complex chemical kinetic approaches due mainly to the lack of time to reach the equilibrium state. These kinetic considerations are even more important for simulating new diesel combustion concepts (such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) and low temperature combustion (LTC)), which are well-known to be kinetically controlled. In such a frame, this work shows, through a reaction mechanism which considers 83 reactions and 38 chemical compounds, the role of the kinetics on the local NO formation/destruction paths under typical diesel engine conditions. The analysis has been carried out for different combustion and dilution rates, showing that equilibrium assumptions overestimate the engine NO emissions. Reactions controlling NO formation during both the combustion and dilution processes have been identified through a sensitivity analysis carried out by using the chemical package CHEMKIN 4.0. This analysis suggests a coupling between the fuel oxidation process and the thermal NO mechanism, which is not considered in most of the diesel engine NO, models. Finally, the differences in modeled engine NO emissions caused by the uncertainties derived from the different kinetic rate values used in the literature are also presented, showing a significant need for more reliable experimental kinetic data obtained under engine pressure and temperature conditions. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Air entrainment; Atomization; Combustion; Diesel engines; Evaporation; Gas emissions; Pressure distribution; Reaction kinetics; Sensitivity analysis; Temperature distribution; Extended Zeldovich reaction mechanism; Homogeneous charge compression ignition; Low temperature combustion; Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39049139432

This is the main conclusion from the presented study. Air pollution exposure is determined for two selected cohorts along the route going from home to working place, and back from working place to home. Exposure is determined with a street pollution model for three scenarios: bicycling along the shortest possible route, bicycling along the low exposure route along less trafficked streets, and finally taking the shortest trip using public transport. Furthermore, calculations are performed for the cases the trip takes place inside as well as outside the traffic rush hours. The results show that the accumulated air pollution exposure for the low exposure route is between 10% and 30% lower for the primary pollutants (NOx and CO). However, the difference is insignificant and in some cases even negative for the secondary pollutants (NO2 and PM10/PM2.5). Considering only the contribution from traffic in the travelled streets, the accumulated air pollution exposure is between 54% and 67% lower for the low exposure route. The bus is generally following highly trafficked streets, and the accumulated exposure along the bus route is therefore between 79% and 115% higher than the high exposure bicycle route (the short bicycle route). Travelling outside the rush hour time periods reduces the accumulated exposure between 10% and 30% for the primary pollutants, and between 5% and 20% for the secondary pollutants. The study indicates that a web based route planner for selecting the low exposure route through the city might be a good service for the public. In addition the public may be advised to travel outside rush hour time periods. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Methanotrophic bacteria present in landfill biocovers can significantly reduce methane emissions via their capacity to oxidize up to 100 of the methane produced. Several biotic and abiotic parameters regulate methane oxidation in soil, such as oxygen, moisture, methane concentration and temperature. Earthworm-mediated bioturbation has been linked to an increase in methanotrophy in a landfill biocover soil (AC Singer et al., unpublished), but the mechanism of this trophic interaction remains unclear. The aims of this study were to determine the composition of the active methanotroph community and to investigate the interactions between earthworms and bacteria in this landfill biocover soil where the methane oxidation activity was significantly increased by the earthworms. Soil microcosms were incubated with 13C-CH""4 and with or without earthworms. DNA and RNA were extracted to characterize the soil bacterial communities, with a particular emphasis on methanotroph populations, using phylogenetic (16S ribosomal RNA) and functional methane monooxygenase (pmoA and mmoX) gene probes, coupled with denaturing gradient-gel electrophoresis, clone libraries and pmoA microarray analyses. Stable isotope probing (SIP) using 13C-CH""4 substrate allowed us to link microbial function with identity of bacteria via selective recovery of heavy 13C-labelled DNA or RNA and to assess the effect of earthworms on the active methanotroph populations. Both types I and II methanotrophs actively oxidized methane in the landfill soil studied. Results suggested that the earthworm-mediated increase in methane oxidation rate in the landfill soil was more likely to be due to the stimulation of bacterial growth or activity than to substantial shifts in the methanotroph community structure. A Bacteroidetes-related bacterium was identified only in the active bacterial community of earthworm-incubated soil but its capacity to actually oxidize methane has to be proven. © 2008 International Society for Microbial Ecology All rights reserved.","Earthworms; Landfill; Methanotrophs; Stable isotope probing","Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; bacterial DNA; methane; ribosome DNA; RNA 16S; animal; annelid worm; article; classification; DNA fingerprinting; DNA microarray; DNA sequence; genetics; metabolism; Methylococcaceae; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; phylogeny; United Kingdom; waste disposal; Animals; DNA Fingerprinting; DNA, Bacterial; DNA, Ribosomal; Great Britain; Methane; Methylococcaceae; Oligochaeta; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oxidation-Reduction; Phylogeny; Refuse Disposal; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41149110753

G1K 9A9, Canada","Many impact studies require climate change information at a finer resolution than that provided by Global Climate Models (GCMs). In the last 10 years, downscaling techniques, both dynamical (i.e. Regional Climate Model) and statistical methods, have been developed to obtain fine resolution climate change scenarios. In this study, an automated statistical downscaling (ASD) regression-based approach inspired by the SDSM method (statistical downscaling model) developed by Wilby, R.L., Dawson, C.W., Barrow, E.M. [2002. SDSM - a decision support tool for the assessment of regional climate change impacts, Environmental Modelling and Software 17, 147-159] is presented and assessed to reconstruct the observed climate in eastern Canada based extremes as well as mean state. In the ASD model, automatic predictor selection methods are based on backward stepwise regression and partial correlation coefficients. The ASD model also gives the possibility to use ridge regression to alleviate the effect of the non-orthogonality of predictor vectors. Outputs from the first generation Canadian Coupled Global Climate Model (CGCM1) and the third version of the coupled global Hadley Centre Climate Model (HadCM3) are used to test this approach over the current period (i.e. 1961-1990), and compare results with observed temperature and precipitation from 10 meteorological stations of Environment Canada located in eastern Canada. All ASD and SDSM models, as these two models are evaluated and inter-compared, are calibrated using NCEP (National Center for Environmental Prediction) reanalysis data before the use of GCMs atmospheric fields as input variables. The results underline certain limitations to downscale the precipitation regime and its strength to downscale the temperature regime. When modeling precipitation, the most commonly combination of predictor variables were relative and specific humidity at 500 hPa, surface airflow strength, 850 hPa zonal velocity and 500 hPa geopotential height. For modeling temperature, mean sea level pressure, surface vorticity and 850 hPa geopotential height were the most dominant variables. To evaluate the performance of the statistical downscaling approach, several climatic and statistical indices were developed. Results indicate that the agreement of simulations with observations depends on the GCMs atmospheric variables used as ""predictors"" in the regression-based approach, and the performance of the statistical downscaling model varies for different stations and seasons. The comparison of SDSM and ASD models indicated that neither could perform well for all seasons and months. However, using different statistical downscaling models and multi-sources GCMs data can provide a better range of uncertainty for climatic and statistical indices. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The sinter is mainly composed of unasslmilated hematite, precipitated hematite and magnetite phases and glassy calcium silicate (slag). Manganese was concentrated in magnetite phase forming a solid solution of 'magnetite-jacobsite spinel'. Calcium ferrites were not detected in the sinter due to Its low basicity (CaO/SiO2≈1). The sinter was non-isothermally reduced with carbon using a heating up reduction technique with the facility of following the high temperature phenomena during the reduction process. High temperature properties were determined from the results of X-ray observations, reduction rate profile and the gasification rate. The results obtained indicated that the reduction of sinter started at 823 K, then at &gt;1073 K and the reduction rate increased due to the interaction between the carbon gasification and gaseous reduction processes. The retardation reduction, smelting reduction and meltdown of metallic iron phenomena occur at 1323, 1473 and 1680 K respectively, which simulate the high temperature region of the blast furnace for iron production. © 2008 Institute of Materials, Minerals and Mining.","Hematite; Magnetite; Magnetite-jacobsite spinel; Microanalysis; Non-isothermal reduction; Sinter; Smelting reduction; Softening","Aluminum; Iron; Iron ore reduction; Iron ore treatment; Iron ores; Ore reduction; Ore sinter; Ore treatment; Ores; Sintering; characterisation; Egyptian; Non isothermal; Iron ore sinter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45849097615

Methods and results: Male Wister rats were subjected to 20 min transient left coronary artery occlusion followed by reperfusion. Autoradiographic analysis and in vivo PET imaging were used to determine myocardial 18F-Galacto-RGD uptake at different time points following reperfusion. Results: PET imaging and autoradiography demonstrated no significant focal myocardial 18F-Galacto-RGD uptake in non-operated control rats and at day 1 after reperfusion. However, focal accumulation in the infarct area started at day 3 (uptake ratio = 1.91 ± 0.22 vs. remote myocardium), peaked between 1 (3.43 ± 0.57) and 3 weeks (3.43 ± 0.95), and decreased to 1.96 ± 0.40 at 6 months after reperfusion. Pretreatment with αvβ3 integrin antagonist c(-RGDfV-) significantly decreased tracer uptake, indicating the specificity of tracer uptake. The time course of focal tracer uptake paralleled vascular density as measured by CD31 immunohistochemical analysis. Conclusion: Regional 18F-Galacto-RGD accumulation suggests up-regulation of αvβ3 integrin expression after myocardial infarction, which peaks between 1 and 3 weeks and remains detectable until 6 months after reperfusion. This new PET tracer is promising for the monitoring of myocardial repair processes. © The Author 2008.","Angiogenesis; Endothelial receptors; Infarction; Ischaemia; Reperfusion","arginylglycylaspartic acid; cyclo(arginylglycylaspartyl dextro phenylalanylvaline); galactoarginylglycylaspartic acid f 18; receptor blocking agent; thallium 201; unclassified drug; vitronectin receptor; CD31 antigen; cyclo(arginyl glycyl aspartyl phenylalanyl valyl); cyclo(arginyl-glycyl-aspartyl-phenylalanyl-valyl); cyclopeptide; drug derivative; fluorogalacto RGD; fluorogalacto-RGD; galactose; radiopharmaceutical agent; vitronectin receptor; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; controlled study; drug uptake; heart infarction; heart muscle ischemia; heart muscle reperfusion; heart scintiscanning; histopathology; immunohistochemistry; male; nonhuman; positron emission tomography; priority journal; protein expression; radioisotope distribution; rat; angiogenesis; animal; autoradiography; coronary blood vessel; disease model; drug antagonism; feasibility study; heart infarction; heart muscle; metabolism; pathology; pathophysiology; positron emission tomography; scintiscanning; time; Wistar rat; Animals; Antigens, CD31; Autoradiography; Coronary Vessels; Disease Models, Animal; Feasibility Studies; Galactose; Immunohistochemistry; Integrin alphaVbeta3; Male; Myocardial Infarction; Myocardium; Neovascularization, Physiologic; Peptides, Cyclic; Positron-Emission Tomography; Radiopharmaceuticals; Rats; Rats, Wistar; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42349091473

Sites were divided into gross vegetation classes indicative of tropic status: mostly Sphagnum (class 1); Sphagnum plus vascular plants (i.e., Carex) (class 2); mostly vascular plants, but still containing Sphagnum (class 3), and; sites dominated by vascular plants with no visible Sphagnum species (class 4). The magnitude Of CO2, acetate and CH4 as end products of anaerobic metabolism varied greatly, but ratios of end product formation indicative of differences in the pathway of C flow and methanogenesis corresponded with vegetation classes, especially at the extremes, e.g., acetate-C accounted for 67% of total C production in Sphagnum-rich sites (class 1) decreasing to 13% in sites devoid of sphagna (class 4). Conversely, CH4 Comprised only 0.4% of products in class 1 sites, but increased to 14% in class 4. Total respiration rates (sum of all three products) varied by only a factor of ∼2 among vegetation classes (200-440 nmol ml-1 day-1), but rates differed greatly if acetate formation was not included suggesting that belowground C cycling can be much more rapid than previously thought. Apparent fractionation factors (α = δ13 CDIC + 1000/δ13 CCH4 + 1000) that estimate methanogenic pathway, i.e., the relative contribution of CO2 reduction or acetate as precursors of methane, varied from ∼1.030 to ∼1.080 and agreed with incubation end product ratios, underscoring the importance of the presence or absence of vascular plants and Sphagnum mosses in affecting the pathway of anaerobic C flow. We contend that methanogenesis in general, including CO2 reduction, is impeded in northern wetlands compared to the production of other C compounds and that its importance decreases with oligotrophy. The connection with vegetation suggests that climate change scenarios leading to increases in vascular plant cover in northern wetlands may shift methanogenic pathways toward increased acetotrophy and increased methane formation, which is a positive feedback on warming.

All calculations yielded similar results consistent with experimental observations. Subsequent analysis of the interaction between formate ion (HCOO-) and proton (H+) within formic acid demonstrated a direct correlation between the changes in fragment interaction energy and the total energy of formic acid upon rotation. To obtain further insights into the interaction, energy decomposition analysis based on the reactive bond orbital (RBO) method was carried out using the 6-311 + G** basis set. The analysis showed the electrostatic effect constitutes a major component that gives rise to the interaction energy variation along the rotation path. Thus, the electrostatic environment of HCOO- can be viewed as the key factor determining the Z ground state and C-O rotational barrier of formic acid. The anisotropic electrostatic environment of formate that favors planar conformations of formic acid may be due to the in-plane distribution of carbonyl lone pairs, and the larger electrostatic attraction in the Z form appears to come from a secondary electrostatic interaction between the proton and the distal oxygen. At the rotational transition state, the O-H bond was not exactly perpendicular to the molecular plane, but slightly tilted toward the E side, which can also be explained by the electrostatic hypothesis. Charge-transfer stabilization was smallest in the Z conformation, but it gradually increased upon rotation to a maximum at the E conformation. Therefore, charge - transfer does not explain the geometry of formic acid. The important role of the electrostatic effect was also observed in in-plane rotation of the O-H bond. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The presence of graphite limits the liberation of CO2 from Martian mantle-derived magmas and thereby constrains volcanogenic fluxes of CO2 to the Martian atmosphere. Thermodynamic calculations for graphite-saturated basalt indicate that dissolved CO2 concentrations near the Martian mantle solidus range from 5 ppm at IW - 1 to 500 ppm at IW + 1 and vary little with pressure along the solidus, but increase with increasing temperature (and melt fraction) above the solidus. For oxygen fugacities between IW - 1 and IW + 1, formation of the ancient (4.5 Ga) 50 km-thick Martian crust could therefore have produced a CO2 atmosphere ranging from 70 mbar to 13 bars, depending chiefly on the mean oxygen fugacity during melting and, to a lesser extent, on temperatures and pressures of partial melting. Subsequent volcanogenic outgassing of CO2 associated with post-4.5 Ga magmatism could have contributed from 40 mbar up to 1.4 bars of CO2 to the atmosphere, depending on oxygen fugacity and the details of melting conditions. However, for both early (~ 4.5 Ga) and subsequent volcanic activity, large CO2 fluxes outgassed to the mantle are probable only at the more oxidized and higher temperature extrema of plausible ranges. If the oxidation state of the Martian mantle is and has been more similar to more reduced estimates, ventilation of CO2 to the Martian atmosphere has been quite limited and may not be sufficient to account for greenhouse conditions apparently required to support liquid surface waters. Finally, low concentrations of CO2 in graphite-saturated magmas under reducing conditions suggest that carbon in the Martian mantle may have originated by precipitation of graphite (or diamond) during solidification of a magma ocean. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Among the numerous serotonergic receptors, the 5-HT1A receptor subtype is of interest because of its involvement in cognition, hippocampal neurogenesis, and mechanism of action of antidepressant drugs. Previous imaging studies have suggested altered availability of 5-HT 1A receptors in MDD but prior antidepressant medication and chronicity of the illness may confound the interpretation. We examined 21 drug-naive primary-care patients with MDD using positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635, a radioligand for 5-HT1A receptors, along with 15 healthy control subjects. Binding to receptors was assessed both regionally and at voxel level with the binding potential (BP) that was estimated using arterial blood input. Compared with healthy controls, the BP of [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 was reduced in patients with MDD in most brain regions, ranging from -9% to -25%. Voxel-level analysis confirmed this finding by showing a widespread reduction of [carbonyl-11C]WAY-100635 BP. No statistically significant associations were observed between BP and total HAMD scores in the patients, but lower BP was associated with higher likelihood of insomnia. This study demonstrated a widespread reduction in the availability of serotonin 5-HT 1A receptors in a relatively large sample of drug-naive primary-care patients with MDD, suggesting the involvement of this receptor subtype in the pathophysiology of the illness.

In some fruits such as pears, which are typically stored under a controlled atmosphere with reduced O2 and increased CO2 levels to extend their commercial storage life, anoxia may occur, eventually leading to physiological disorders. In this manuscript we have developed a mathematical model to predict the internal gas concentrations, including permeation, diffusion, and respiration and fermentation kinetics. Pear fruit has been selected as a case study. The model has been used to perform in silico experiments to evaluate the effect of, for example, fruit size or ambient gas concentration on internal O2 and CO2 levels. The model incorporates the actual shape of the fruit and was solved using fluid dynamics software. Environmental conditions such as temperature and gas composition have a large effect on the internal distribution of oxygen and carbon dioxide in fruit. Also, the fruit size has a considerable effect on local metabolic gas concentrations; hence, depending on the size, local anaerobic conditions may result, which eventually may lead to physiological disorders. The model developed in this manuscript is to our knowledge the most comprehensive model to date to simulate gas exchange in plant tissue. It can be used to evaluate the effect of environmental stresses on fruit via in silico experiments and may lead to commercial applications involving long-term storage of fruit under controlled atmospheres. © 2008 Ho et al.",,"ambient air; anaerobic metabolism; article; computational fluid dynamics; computer model; computer simulation; controlled atmosphere; environmental stress; environmental temperature; fruit size; fruit storage; gas exchange; gas flow; pear; photosynthesis; active transport; biological model; cell respiration; chemistry; diffusion; fruit; metabolism; physiology; plant leaf; Pyrus; carbon dioxide; oxygen; Biological Transport, Active; Carbon Dioxide; Cell Respiration; Computer Simulation; Diffusion; Fruit; Models, Biological; Oxygen; Plant Leaves; Pyrus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41849106095

Through a series of international workshops, INTIMATE has encouraged direct collaboration between scientists with interests and expertise in a wide range of palaeoenvironmental approaches. The workshops have focused on the dissemination of good practice in the dating, correlation and synthesis of diverse palaeoenvironmental records that span the LGIT. This special issue of Quaternary Science Reviews presents some of the outcomes of the 8th INTIMATE International Workshop held in Iceland in September 2005, and focuses on four themes considered vital to INTIMATE's long-term strategy. (1) An event stratigraphy approach, which uses the Greenland oxygen isotope record as a stratotype sequence, lies at the core of INTIMATE's operations. A revised event stratigraphy scheme for application to North Atlantic LGIT records is presented, which is based on the new GICC05 Greenland ice-core chronology. (2) New tree-ring data from Switzerland and the application of Bayesian-based procedures in the analysis of comprehensive radiocarbon data sets provide much potential for reducing the uncertainties in radiocarbon-based age models. (3) Three of the contributions present new evidence that helps to refine the tephrostratigraphy of the LGIT in the NE Atlantic and New Zealand regions. (4) Establishing the precise order and synchroneity of events during the LGIT is vital to understand the causes and effects of abrupt climate change. Data are presented from the Baltic region and Alaska, which vary in degree of compatibility with North Atlantic records. Two final papers consider the roles of Dansgaard-Oeschger events on thermokarst during the Middle Weichselian and of solar activity variations during the mid-Holocene; both illustrate how the INTIMATE event stratigraphy approach can apply to the study of other time intervals. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Typically, it employs methods of solving the mixture resolution problem using chemical composition data for airborne particulate matter (PM) samples. In such cases, the outcome is the identification of the pollution source types and estimates of the contribution of each source type to the observed concentrations. Receptor modeling also involves efforts to identify the locations of the sources through the use of local meteorology or ensembles of air parcel back trajectories. Compositional data were collected in a number of monitoring programs. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency deployed a network of urban airborne PM samplers to provide PM2.5 composition data for urban centers across the United States. In addition, advanced monitoring methods were deployed at ""supersites."" These data show the differences in composition in different part of the country and were also used to identify and apportion the particle sources. These results were used to (1)develop effective and efficient air quality management plans and (2) refine emission inventories for input into deterministic models to predict changes in air quality as the result of the implementation of various management plans. The apportionments also serve as exposure estimates for health effects models to identify those components of the PM that are most closely related to observed adverse health effects. Although current regulations target total airborne mass concentrations, such health effects results might result in targeting those sources that are most likely linked to adverse health effects and thus produce the maximum health benefit.

Up-regulation of the antioxidant and glyoxalase systems provides protection against NaCl-induced oxidative damage in plants. Thiol-disulfide contents, glutathione content and its associated enzyme activities involved in the antioxidant defense and glyoxalase systems, and protein carbonylation in tobacco Bright Yellow-2 cells grown in suspension culture were investigated to assess the protection offered by proline and glycinebetaine against salt stress. Salt stress increased protein carbonylation, contents of thiol, disulfide, reduced (GSH) and oxidized (GSSG) forms of glutathione, and the activity of glutathione-S-transferase and glyoxalase II enzymes, but decreased redox state of both thiol-disulfide and glutathione, and the activity of glutathione peroxidase and glyoxalase I enzymes involved in the ROS and MG detoxification systems. Exogenous application of proline or glycinebetaine resulted in a reduction of protein carbonylation, and in an increase in glutathione redox state and activity of glutathione peroxidase, glutathione-S-transferase and glyoxalase I under salt stress. Neither proline nor glycinebetaine, however, had any direct protective effect on NaCl-induced GSH-associated enzyme activities.

The reconstruction is derived by comparing a new high-resolution stalagmite δ18O record with an existing record from the same moisture transport pathway. The new record is from Heshang Cave (30°27′N, 110°25′E; 294 m) and shows no sign of kinetic or evaporative effects so can be reliably interpreted as a record of local rainfall composition and temperature. Heshang lies 600 km downwind from Dongge Cave which has a published high-resolution δ18O record (Wang, Y.J., Cheng, H., Edwards, R.L., He, Y.Q., Kong, X.G., An, Z.S., Wu, J.Y., Kelly, M.J., Dykoski, C.A., Li, X.D., 2005. The Holocene Asian monsoon: links to solar changes and North Atlantic climate. Science 308, 854-857). By differencing co-eval δ18O values for the two caves, secondary controls on δ18O (e.g. moisture source, moisture transport, non-local rainfall, temperature) are circumvented and the resulting Δδ18O signal is controlled directly by the amount of rain falling between the two sites. This is confirmed by comparison with rainfall data from the instrumental record, which also allows a calibration of the Δδ18O proxy. The calibrated Δδ18O record provides a quantitative history of rainfall in southwest China which demonstrates that rainfall was 8% higher than today during the Holocene climatic optimum (≈ 6 ka), but only 3% higher during the early Holocene. Significant multi-centennial variability also occurred, with notable dry periods at 8.2 ka, 4.8-4.1 ka, 3.7-3.1 ka, 1.4-1.0 ka and during the Little Ice Age. This Holocene rainfall record provides a good target with which to test climate models. The approach used here, of combining stalagmite records from more than one location, will also allow quantification of rainfall patterns for past times in other regions. © 2008.","East Asian monsoon; paleoclimate; rainfall; speleothem","Climate model; Paleoclimate; Stalagmite; Computer simulation; Drought; Floods; Minerals; Rain; Climatology; drought; flooding; Holocene; monsoon; paleoclimate; rainfall; speleothem; stalagmite; Asia; China; Dongge Cave; Eurasia; Far East; Guizhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39049111011

The results from this study also indicated that the 38 industrialized countries are unable to meet their targets under the Kyoto Protocol within the specified time period, which are probably caused by the econometric method's inability to predict accurately the extents and development of innovative technologies and Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects. If the international community truly wants to reduce the GHG emissions, the effectiveness of the existing international framework for emissions reduction needs to be reconsidered seriously, and the global cooperation mechanism also needs to be greatly enhanced. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasing use of gas collection systems has reduced the risk of escaping methane emissions entering the atmosphere, but gas capture is not 100% efficient, and further, there are still many instances when gas collection systems are not used. Biotic methane mitigation systems exploit the propensity of some naturally occurring bacteria to oxidize methane. By providing optimum conditions for microbial habitation and efficiently routing landfill gases to where they are cultivated, a number of bio-based systems, such as interim or long-term biocovers, passively or actively vented biofilters, biowindows and daily-used biotarps, have been developed that can alone, or with gas collection, mitigate landfill methane emissions. This paper reviews the science that guides bio-based designs; summarizes experiences with the diverse natural or engineered substrates used in such systems; describes some of the studies and field trials being used to evaluate them; and discusses how they can be used for better landfill operation, capping, and aftercare. © ISWA 2008.","Bio-window; Biocover; Biofilter; Landfill aftercare; Landfill gas; Methane oxidation; Wmr 1317-2","Biodegradation; Biodiversity; Global warming; Land fill; Methane; Oxidation; Waste management; Biotic mitigation system; Gas collection system; Microbial habitation; Gas emissions; methane; Biodegradation; Biodiversity; Gas emissions; Global warming; Land fill; Methane; Oxidation; Waste management; bacterium; biofiltration; carbon emission; emission control; landfill; methane; article; biodegradation; biofilter; climate change; environmental economics; global climate; landfill; municipal solid waste; organic waste; oxidation; priority journal; solid waste management; waste gas management; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Carbon Dioxide; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Methane; Refuse Disposal; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39649103406

The measurement and analysis of average indoor CO2 concentration is useful to understand the performance of a ventilation system. However, uncertainties due to the ventilation rate effectiveness as well as the initial state, build-up, fluctuation, and decay of indoor CO2 concentration from occupant load variation have not been addressed in many measurements; considerable measurement efforts are obligatory. This study, taking the long-term CO2 measurement and occupant profile of a typical open-plan office building as reference, has developed a database to examine the probable errors of an alternative sampling scheme for assessing indoor CO2 level in which the average pollutant concentration is obtained from two short sampling periods in two sampling sessions when the building is occupied. The results show that the assessed CO2 level deviates from the long-term average and the probable errors correlate with the required measurement time and occupant load profile. At certain confidence levels, the potential reductions in measurement time of the alternative scheme, as compared with an 8-h continuous one, will be up to 30%, some 20% less than the reduction of measurement time for assessing indoor radon level. © SAGE Publications 2008.","Carbon dioxide (CO2) sampling; Indoor air quality (IAQ); Occupant load; Offices","carbon dioxide; air conditioning; air quality; air quality standard; air sampling; ambient air; article; building; carbon dioxide measurement; concentration (parameters); correlation analysis; environmental impact assessment; human; pollutant; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349185663

We sampled ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera, Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Platypodinae) from four tree species: Artocarpus altilis, Ficus nodosa, Leea indica and Nauclea orientalis, at three sites forming a 1000 km transect in lowland rainforests of northern Papua New Guinea. A standardized volume of wood from trunk, branches and twigs was sampled for ambrosia beetles from three individuals of the four tree species at each site. Each tree was killed standing and left exposed to beetle colonization for 20 days prior to sampling. We obtained 12 751 individuals from 84 morphospecies of ambrosia beetles. We surveyed most of the local species richness at each site, predicted by Chao 2 species richness estimates. The similarity of ambrosia beetle communities, estimated by Chao-Sorensen index, was not correlated with their geographical distance. Likelihood analysis and Q-mode analysis using Monte Carlo-generated null distribution of beetles among sites supported the hypothesis that the assemblages of ambrosia beetles at different sites are drawn from the same species pool, regardless of their geographical distance. Tree part (trunk, branch, or twig) was more important predictor of the composition of ambrosia beetle communities than was the host species or geographical location. All three variables, however, explained only a small portion of variability in ambrosia assemblages. The distribution of ambrosia beetles among tree parts, tree species and study sites was mostly random, suggesting limited importance of host specificity or dispersal limitation. © 2007 The authors.",,"beetle; colonization; community composition; estimation method; geographical distribution; host specificity; lowland environment; rainforest; species diversity; species richness; Melanesia; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; Papua New Guinea; Ambrosia; Artocarpus altilis; Coleoptera; Curculionidae; Ficus nodosa; Hexapoda; Leea indica; Nauclea orientalis; Platypodini; Scolytinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38649140666

The paper first outlines the English policy context in terms of responsibilities, powers and resources available to local transport planners, and identifies the tools of government that can be more efficiently applied to effect a more sustainable transport system which specifically reduces CO2 emissions. A snapshot of transport decision-making in five local transport authorities in England is presented, using a case study methodology, which explores the joint working practices of practitioners in five public policy sectors that influence accessibility patterns. The case study highlights the norms and values of the local public administrators who affect local transport mobility and how they in turn are hindered both by the rigidity of central government direction and an insufficiency of implementation tools. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A variety of methodologies for scenario construction have been experimented with, all of them to a greater or lesser extent depending on the use of climate models. Yet the development of climate scenarios involves much more than climate modelling. The process of scenario development is one of negotiation between relevant stakeholders-funding agencies, policy communities, scientists, social actors and decision-makers in a variety of sectors. This process of negotiation is illustrated through an analysis of four generations of UK climate scenarios-published in 1991, 1996, 1998 and 2002. Using ideas from science and technology studies and the sociology of scientific knowledge to guide our analysis, we reveal complex relationships between the interests of UK science, policy and society. Negotiating climate scenarios involves compromise between the needs of policy, science and decision-maker in relation to, for example, the selection of the development pathway(s) and emissions scenario(s), the choice of climate model(s), the assessment and communication of uncertainty and the presentational devices used. These insights have a significant bearing on the way in which climate scenarios should be viewed and used in public discourse, strategic planning and policy development. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

A second question is whether bio-sequestration in the Wet Tropics of Queensland is cost-competitive with southern Australia. A third, given that plantations of monocultures also provide carbon sinks, is: are the goals of carbon sequestration and biodiversity mutually exclusive or complementary? Australia intends to meet its Kyoto greenhouse gas emissions target even though it has not ratified the Protocol. While a national system of carbon emission cap and trade does not exist, unilateral action by some states to mandate industry caps has generated a demand for offsets. However, it is the voluntary market for offsets, stimulated by demand by companies and government departments that is most active. The favourable climate and soils of the Wet Tropics Region of north Queensland have enabled the evolution of unique ecosystems. Deforestation of these has been greatly reduced by World Heritage listing of the Wet Tropics. Nevertheless much of the landscape remains fragmented. An official priority is the encouragement of rainforest plantations on private land with the aim of augmenting endangered ecosystems and the habitat of iconic species, but reforestation is heavily subsidised by the Australian government. Using methodology that allows the comparison of uneven streams of costs and benefits, it is found that - at present prices - payments for sequestered carbon defray only a small proportion of costs, providing a level of incentive insufficient to stimulate restoration. Comparative analysis shows that monocultures sequester carbon at a much lower price per tonne. However, despite the relatively high growth rates of monocultures in the region, their cost per tonne of carbon are greater than costs in southern Australia. A decreasing supply of suitable land for bio-sequestration offsets in southern Australia may well force brokers to look to the Wet Tropics. In this event - the economic analysis suggests - land in areas that carried endangered or threatened ecosystems will be devoted to monocultures rather than restored rainforest. The paper highlights the asymmetry between the availability of credits for carbon and of credits for biodiversity and the need for public investment in conservation and restoration. Requiring further investigation is the potential demand for carbon offsets with high biodiversity benefits - so called ""boutique abatements"" - that could readily be supplied in the Queensland Wet Tropics. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To identify the effect of sole turbulence intensity, a new combustor with a turbulence generator, which can increase the turbulence intensity of air stream under the condition of an identical mean velocity, was adopted. The experiment was conducted with and without the turbulence generator for the two fuel cases of H2 : N2 = 1 : 1 and H2 : N2 = 1 : 2, by volume. As a result, as the turbulence intensity increased, the reducing effect of NOx was more significant in the condition of a higher flame temperature. In addition, the conversion ratio from NO to NO2 increased. Two major factors can reduce the production of NOx as the turbulence intensity increases: significant NOx reduction corresponding to about 70% was found in the upstream region due to the increase in the strain rate effect and in the downstream region due to the rapid mixing effect. From these results, it is possible to conclude that adjustment of turbulence intensity is a very useful method to reduce NOx emission in hydrogen nonpremixed jet flames. © 2007 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Hydrogen; Nitrogen oxides (NOx); Nonpremixed flame; Turbulence intensity","Flame research; Particulate emissions; Turbulence; Nonpremixed flame; Turbulence generators; Turbulence intensity; Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849143230

In East Asia, precipitation is concentrated in the short monsoon season, which reduces plants water availability in the dry season. Furthermore, most forests are located in mountainous areas because of high demand for agricultural land, which results in increased lateral water flux and uneven distribution of plant available water. These climatic and topographic features of the forests make them more vulnerable to drought conditions. In this study, the eco-hydrological model (Regional Hydro-Ecological Simulation System) is validated with various water and carbon flux measurements in a small catchment in Korea. The model is then extended to the regional scale with fine-resolution remote sensing data to evaluate the Moderate Resolution Imaging Radiometer (MODIS) leaf area index and gross primary productivity (GPP) products. Long-term model runs simulated severe drought effect in 2001 well, which is clearly shown in the ring increment data. However, MODIS GPP does not capture this drought effect in 2001, which might be from a simplified treatment of water stress in the MODIS GPP algorithm. This study shows that the MODIS GPP products can potentially overestimate carbon uptake specifically during drought conditions driven by soil water stress. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Drought effect; Eco-hydrological model; Gross primary productivity; MODIS; RHES Sys","carbon flux; drought; ecohydrology; forest ecosystem; leaf area index; modeling; MODIS; primary production; remote sensing; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42949101272

In 2003 and 2004, the IMPROVE network began operating collocated samplers at several sites to evaluate the precision of its aerosol measurements. This paper presents the precisions calculated from the collocated data according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency's guidelines Code of Federal Regulations [CFR, 1997.

These values range from 4% for sulfate to 115% for the third elemental carbon fraction. Collocated precision tends to improve with increasing detection rates, is typically better when the analysis is performed on the whole filter instead of just a fraction of the filter, and is better for species that are predominantly in the smaller size fractions. The collocated precisions are also used to evaluate the accuracy of the uncertainty estimates that are routinely reported with the concentrations.

Many experts attribute the receding shorelines and apparent rise in sea levels around Pacific island countries to climate change. It is questionable whether ordinary people are making similar connections. Raising the level of concern about climate change is essential if this is to change. This paper argues that civil society, in the form of non-government organisations (NGOs), offers a very effective means for creating this change. Non-government organisations work closely with local communities, and can use this relationship to communicate the need to give urgent attention to climate change issues. NGOs also have access to policy makers, including government, which they can use to help align policies with community priorities.","Civil society; Climate change; Community adaptation; Nongovernment organizations; Pacific",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57249086545

The objective of this study is to assess environmental Ir pollution and its urinary levels in workers and an urban control group. Environmental monitoring inside a tram consisted in air samplings of total suspended particles (TSP), PM10 and PM2.5 carried out during November 2005. Urinary Ir levels were evaluated in 64 municipal tram drivers and in 58 administrative employees as controls. Quantification of Ir in air samples and urine was performed by means of Sector Field Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry. Means ± standard deviation of Ir levels in TSP, in PM10 and PM2.5 fractions were 1.43 ± 1.66, 0.44 ± 0.27 and 0.36 ± 0.19 pg m-3, respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed among urinary Ir values in the exposed subjects and control group. The Ir levels in Rome air are still sufficiently low, even if the increased use of new Ir-based catalysts could be of some concern in the near future. The results of our study are of interest as they are a first attempt to explore airborne levels and urinary concentrations of Ir in an urban context at medium-high density of vehicle traffic. Particular attention should be given to the fact that Ir was found in the finest dust particles as the effects of fine particles containing Ir have not yet been studied. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Through 110 household interviews and seven group discussions, an assessment was conducted of peoples' perception about major flora and fauna of the mangrove ecosystem, benefits derived from the forest, present condition of the forest, causes of degradation, and ways to improve the situation. Around one-fourth of the respondents mentioned that they were highly dependent on the ecosystem. The most important perceived benefits were: provision of raw materials, prevention against natural disasters, climate regulation and soil retention. However, the majority (>80%) of the respondents perceived the ecosystem to be degrading. Encroachment and illicit felling were identified as the main causes of such degradation.

To reveal the genetic structure of arctic-alpine plants near the southern edge of their range in East Asia, 159 samples of Diapensia lapponica subsp. obovata (Diapensiaceae) were collected from 22 populations in Japan. Based on 1,134 bp of chloroplast DNA (cpDNA), we determined 10 haplotypes. Neighbor-joining (NJ) analysis, including D. lapponica from Sweden and Schizocodon soldanelloides, revealed that all haplotypes in Japan were monophyletic. Genetic differentiation between populations of central Honshu and northern Japan was strongly supported by the NJ tree (100%), analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA, 68%), and Monmonier's algorithm (>95%). The most ancestral haplotype rarely occurred in Japan, which implied that the extant genetic structure was not caused by genetic divergence during colonization. Thus, these results suggest that the arctic-alpine plant D. lapponica subsp. obovata survived climatic oscillations in central Honshu.

This study compared isotherms of two commonly available and distinct reference BCs (n-hexane soot (BCRM) and diesel particulate matter (SRM 2975)) and a natural sediment from a source with little black carbon (Lake Hartwell, SC) using 3,3′,4-trichlorobiphenyl (IUPAC #35) as a model sorbate. There was greater sorptivity for PCB-35 by BCRM than by SRM 2975. The observed differences in sorption between the two reference black carbons for PCB-35 may be ascribed to the different chemical characteristics of the black carbons. Differences in pore volume distribution at &lt;16 Å pore width are less likely to be responsible for the observed differences in sorption. The elemental analysis confirmed that BCRM was a pure n-hexane soot because only C, H and O were measured. In contrast, SRM 2975 also contained N and S and a higher O% than BCRM. Compared to the low BC sediment, the two reference BCs had greater pore volume distributions, surface areas, total pore volumes and sorption. The observed nF (i.e., Freundlich exponent) values for PCB indicated greater linearity of the isotherms for the natural sediment than for the reference black carbons. For designing studies of sorption of HOCs in natural systems, in particular, when PCBs are contaminants of concern, results of this study can aid selection of the appropriate reference BCs. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

There is also concern that meeting the rising demand for food is leading to environmental degradation thereby exacerbating factors in part responsible for climate change, and further undermining the food systems upon which food security is based. A major emphasis of climate change/food security research over recent years has addressed the agronomic aspects of climate change, and particularly crop yield. This has provided an excellent foundation for assessments of how climate change may affect crop productivity, but the connectivity between these results and the broader issues of food security at large are relatively poorly explored; too often discussions of food security policy appear to be based on a relatively narrow agronomic perspective. To overcome the limitation of current agronomic research outputs there are several scientific challenges where further agronomic effort is necessary, and where agronomic research results can effectively contribute to the broader issues underlying food security. First is the need to better understand how climate change will affect cropping systems including both direct effects on the crops themselves and indirect effects as a result of changed pest and weed dynamics and altered soil and water conditions. Second is the need to assess technical and policy options for either reducing the deleterious impacts or enhancing the benefits of climate change on cropping systems while minimising further environmental degradation. Third is the need to understand how best to address the information needs of policy makers and report and communicate agronomic research results in a manner that will assist the development of food systems adapted to climate change. There are, however, two important considerations regarding these agronomic research contributions to the food security/climate change debate. The first concerns scale. Agronomic research has traditionally been conducted at plot scale over a growing season or perhaps a few years, but many of the issues related to food security operate at larger spatial and temporal scales. Over the last decade, agronomists have begun to establish trials at landscape scale, but there are a number of methodological challenges to be overcome at such scales. The second concerns the position of crop production (which is a primary focus of agronomic research) in the broader context of food security. Production is clearly important, but food distribution and exchange also determine food availability while access to food and food utilisation are other important components of food security. Therefore, while agronomic research alone cannot address all food security/climate change issues (and hence the balance of investment in research and development for crop production vis à vis other aspects of food security needs to be assessed), it will nevertheless continue to have an important role to play: it both improves understanding of the impacts of climate change on crop production and helps to develop adaptation options; and also - and crucially - it improves understanding of the consequences of different adaptation options on further climate forcing. This role can further be strengthened if agronomists work alongside other scientists to develop adaptation options that are not only effective in terms of crop production, but are also environmentally and economically robust, at landscape and regional scales. Furthermore, such integrated approaches to adaptation research are much more likely to address the information need of policy makers. The potential for stronger linkages between the results of agronomic research in the context of climate change and the policy environment will thus be enhanced. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The model was developed for integrating observational data and validated with net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) data from AsiaFlux sites. For each 30-s × 30-s (about 1 km2) grid cell, the ecosystem model was used to simulate daily photosynthesis, respiration, decomposition, and ecosystem growth. Such high-resolution simulation allowed us to explicitly capture land surface heterogeneity and to ameliorate the scale-gap in comparison between simulated and observed fluxes. The simulated NEE was compared with data from three AsiaFlux sites (Tomakomai, Fujiyoshida, and Takayama) during the period 2000-2005, with results suggesting that the model retrieved the carbon budget characteristics, such as differences in seasonal sink/source variation among biome types. The regional simulation indicated that terrestrial ecosystems in East Asia had a net primary productivity of 996 Tg C year-1 and a net ecosystem productivity of 58 Tg C year-1 (1 Tg = 1012 g), indicating a net carbon sink equivalent to 11% of regional anthropogenic emissions. Interannual variability in the carbon budget was evident: East Asian ecosystems absorbed more carbon in 2002, the warmest year with a longer growing period. Based on the regional result, the spatial representativeness of the AsiaFlux sites was investigated with regard to climatic condition and carbon budgets. This model provides a reliable means for scaling-up from site to regional scales, and the findings have implications for observational studies and ecosystem management related to carbon sequestration and climate change mitigation. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Biofuel producers were confused about whether to invest in cheap or clean biofuels because member state governments have changed their biofuel targets, creating uncertainty in the market. The European Commission proposed that 20% of its energy mix comes from renewable sources by 2020 compared with 8.5% today. But £30 billion/yr to 2030 of investment is required to just build conversion facilities for biofuels, indicating that a 300 million gal plant should be built every 5-6 days. The UK faces a 303 million L shortfall in biofuel capacity as it aspires to meet its target of 5% of transportation fuel from biofuels by 2010. Bioethanol and biodiesel are likely to compete against each other depending on oil prices, incentives for developments, and penalties. Dialogue was essential with the automobile industry to coincide its timetable on producing cars for biofuels.

Relative diversification rates increased towards the equator, suggesting that differences in per-lineage net diversification may be an important component of the latitudinal diversity gradient. The amplitude of Quaternary climate oscillations experienced by families explained variation in diversification equally well compared to contemporary energy measures, and energy and climate change measures were intercorrelated, making it difficult to reject either as a causal mechanism. Many putative mechanisms linking diversification to energy availability do not apply to plants, whereas the climate change mechanism has more support.

This is illustrated by applying a digital state variable feedback control approach known as Non-Minimum State Space (NMSS) control to the problem of specifying carbon emissions to control atmospheric CO2 concentrations in the presence of uncertainty. It is shown that the control approach naturally lends itself to integrating both anticipatory and reflexive mitigation strategies within a single unified framework. The framework explicitly considers the closed-loop nature of climate mitigation, and employs a policy orientated optimisation procedure to specify the properties of this closed-loop system. The product of this exercise is a control law that is suitably conditioned to regulate atmospheric CO2 concentrations through assimilating online information within a 25-year review cycle framework. It is shown that the optimal control law is also robust when faced with significant levels of uncertainty about the functioning of the global carbon cycle. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Concentration (process); Emission control; Feedback control; Gas emissions; Problem solving; Stochastic control systems; Uncertainty analysis; Climate mitigation; Reflexive mitigation strategies; Carbon dioxide; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; concentration (composition); emission control; environmental legislation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37549007909

The objectives of this paper are to determine the types of CMs that control HOC sorption in the oxidized and reduced zones of a glacially deposited groundwater sediment in central Illinois, with a special emphasis on the roles of kerogen and black carbon. After collection, the sediments were treated to obtain fractions of the sediment samples enriched in different types of CMs (e.g., humic acid, kerogen, black carbon), and selected fractions were subject to quantitative petrographic analysis. The original sediments and their enrichment fractions were evaluated for their ability to sorb trichloroethene (TCE), a common groundwater pollutant. Isotherm results and mass fractions of CM enrichments were used to calculate sorption contributions of different CMs. The results indicate that CMs in the heavy fractions dominate sorption because of their greater mass. Black carbon mass fractions of total CMs in the reduced sediments were calculated and used to estimate the sorption contribution of these materials. Results indicate that in the reduced sediments, black carbon may sequester as much as 32% of the sorbed TCE mass, but that kerogen and humin are the dominant sorption environments. Organic carbon normalized sorption coefficients (KOC) were compared to literature values. Values for the central Illinois sediments are relatively large and in the range of values determined for materials high in kerogen and humin. This work demonstrates the advantage of using both sequential chemical treatment and petrographic analysis to analyze the sorption contributions of different CMs in natural soils and sediments, and the importance of sorption to natural geopolymers in groundwater sediments not impacted by anthropogenic sources of black carbon. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbonaceous materials; Sequential chemical treatment; Computation theory; Groundwater; Oxidation; Sediments; Sorption; Organic pollutants; carbon; ground water; humic acid; humin; kerogen; organic compound; polymer; trichloroethylene; unclassified drug; Computation theory; Groundwater; Organic pollutants; Oxidation; Sediments; Sorption; black carbon; freshwater sediment; hydrophobicity; isotherm; organic pollutant; petrography; sediment pollution; soil pollution; sorption; trichloroethylene; adsorption; article; environmental impact assessment; hydrophobicity; mass; oxidation; pollution transport; quantitative analysis; sediment; United States; water pollutant; Adsorption; Carbon; Geologic Sediments; Organic Chemicals; Soil Pollutants; Illinois; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40949157117

This lack of recovery is believed to be partly the consequence of the depletion of exchangeable base cations (principally calcium, Ca) from watershed soils. Although the implications of reduced Ca availability for biological communities remain poorly understood, the effects on crustacean zooplankton populations may be severe, as Ca is the primary structural component of the crustacean zooplankton exoskeleton. Because the daphniid resting egg is protected by a modified portion of the exoskeleton (ephippia) and because these ephippia are well preserved in lake sediments, we investigated whether inter-specific differences in Ca content are recoverable from Daphnia ephippia. However, using two methods, we did not find a recoverable Ca signal in the ephippia, indicating that future efforts should be focused upon sedimentary taxonomic assemblage differences, not differences in ephippial Ca levels. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Acidification; Calcium (Ca); Cladocera; Daphnia; Ephippia; Zooplankton","acid deposition; acidification; calcium; crustacean; environmental indicator; lacustrine deposit; lake water; paleolimnology; sulfur; taxonomy; zooplankton; Canadian Shield; North America; Cladocera; Crustacea; Daphnia; Daphnia ephippia; Daphniidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41049092127

In this paper, by using Li-6400 Portable Photosynthesis System (LI-COR), WUE at leaf level was analyzed under controlled photosynthetic photons flux density (PPFD) and CO2 concentration conditions across 9 plant species including maize (Zea mays), sorghum (Sorghum vulgare), millet (Setaria italica), soybean (Glycine max), peanut (Arachis phyogaea), sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), rice (Oryza sativa), Masson pine (Pinus massoniana) and Schima superba. We had developed a new model to estimate the water use efficiency in response to the combined effects of light and CO2 concentration. Our measured data validated that this model could simulate the changes of water use efficiency very well under combined effect of light and CO2 concentration. It could be used to estimate contribution of photosynthesis increase and transpiration decline on water use efficiency with the rising of CO2 concentration. Great differences in water use efficiency occurred in these different plant species under various CO2 concentration levels. Based on water use efficiency at regional scale, we concluded that plants should be separated into C3 plants and C4 plants, and furthermore, C3 plants should be separated into herbaceous plants and woody plants.

In order to account for this, the BSC-CNS currently operates daily photochemical forecasts in the Iberian Peninsula with MM5-EMEP-CMAQ modelling system and Saharan dust forecasts over Southern Europe with Eta/DREAM. The necessity of coupling both modelling systems is addressed by the study of a long summer episode combining regional re-circulations and Saharan dust covering from June 19 to July 12, 2006. As a first approach, the natural dust contribution from Eta/DREAM is added on-line to the anthropogenic output of CMAQ. The performance of the model has been quantitatively evaluated with discrete and categorical (skill scores) statistics by a fully operational on-line comparison of the first-layer simulations results of CMAQ and CMAQ+DREAM and the values measured in two different stations located in the Mediterranean part of the domain. The results indicate a remarkable improvement in the discrete and skill-scores evaluation (accuracy, critical success index and probability of detection) of PM10 exceedances set in regulations when using CMAQ+DREAM compared to CMAQ- or DREAM-alone simulations.

They demand a detailed diagnosis of those areas where the exceedances of thresholds related to human health are found. In this sense, there is a need for modelling studies for the specific area of the NWM that take into account the annual cycle to address the diagnosis of air pollution. A new approach to the modelling of air quality in the NWM has been adopted by combining the WRF-EMICAT-CMAQ-DREAM modelling system to diagnose the current status of the levels of photochemical air pollution (focusing on ozone, O3; nitrogen dioxide, NO2; carbon monoxide, CO; and particulate matter, PM10) in the area during an annual cycle (year 2004). The complexity of the area of study requires the application of high spatial and temporal resolution (2 km and 1 h). The annual simulations need to cover the complex different meteorological situations and types of episodes of air pollution in the area of study. The outputs of the modelling system are evaluated against observations from 52 meteorological and 59 air quality stations belonging to the Environmental Department of the Catalonia Government (Spain), which involve a dense and accurate spatial distribution of stations in the territory (32,215 km2). The results indicate a good behaviour of the model in both coastal and inland areas of the NWM, with a slight trend to the overestimation of tropospheric O3 concentrations and the underestimation of other photochemical pollutants (NO2, CO and PM10). The modelling diagnosis indicates that the main air quality-related problems in the NWM are the exceedances of the 1-hr O3 information threshold set in the Directive 2002/3/EC (180 μg m- 3) as a consequence of the transport of O3 precursors downwind the Barcelona Greater Area (BGA); and the exceedances of the annual value for the protection of human health for NO2 and PM10 (40 μg m- 3, Directive 1999/30/EC), both in the BGA, as a consequence of the high traffic-related emissions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we compare two sampling methodologies used in the four caves. In Pindal and Herrerias Cave high temporal resolution is achieved with a dripwater, collector that collects discrete samples every 48 hours. In Tito Bustillo and Las Maravillas Caves a higher spatial resolution is achieved (16 sampling points in each one), but with a frequency of sampling ranging from 15 days to 6 months. Wastewater and livestock waste appear to be the principal sources of contamination to cave waters. Caves with concentrated livestock (stables) or urban and residential wastewater systems directly situated above the cave exhibit the highest level of contamination detected in elevated concentrations of nitrogen species and in some cases depressed oxygen availability in waters.","Cave; Dripwater; Groundwater; Karst; Water contamination","cave; groundwater pollution; nitrate; pollutant source; potassium; spatial resolution; total organic carbon; wastewater; water quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349119419

Despite considerable spatial variations, nitrogen oxides (NOx) emission reductions are overall more effective than volatile organic compound (VOC) control for attaining the 8 h ozone standard in this region for this episode, in contrast to the VOC control that works better for attaining the prior 1 h ozone standard. Interbasin source contributions of NOx emissions are limited to the northern part of the SJV, while anthropogenic VOC (AVOC) emissions, especially those emitted at night, influence ozone formation in the SJV further downwind. Among model input parameters studied here, uncertainties in emissions of NOx and AVOC, and the rate coefficient of the OH + NO2 termination reaction, have the greatest effect on first-order ozone responses to changes in NOx emissions. Uncertainties in biogenic VOC emissions only have a modest effect because they are generally not collocated with anthropogenic sources in this region. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Air pollution; Emission control; Sensitivity analysis; Volatile organic compounds; Emission reductions; Rate coefficient; Ozone; nitrogen oxide; organic compound; ozone; volatile agent; Air pollution; Emission control; Ozone; Sensitivity analysis; Volatile organic compounds; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; biogenic emission; emission control; human activity; nitrogen oxides; ozone; pollutant source; pollutant transport; reaction rate; sensitivity analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; standard (regulation); uncertainty analysis; volatile organic compound; air monitoring; air pollution; article; sensitivity analysis; standard; United States; Air Pollutants; California; Models, Theoretical; Ozone; Sensitivity and Specificity; Volatilization; California; North America; San Joaquin Valley; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43749096618

For Africa, carbon sequestration also represents an opportunity to fund sustainable development through financial inflows. However, with a low share of global carbon trade, there are strong concerns that African countries are losing out on this valuable opportunity. Through a comprehensive review of 23 carbon sequestration projects across 14 countries, this paper discusses ways to overcome critical challenges to scale up carbon investments in Africa. These projects are expected to sequester 26.85 million tCO2 beyond the baseline situation. Within the continent, East Africa is the preferred destination for carbon investors. Most projects are non-Kyoto compliant and represent voluntary emission reductions. While project benefits such as increased local incomes and improved natural resources are promising, there are concerns that conversion of grasslands into tree plantations can harm local ecosystems. Insecure land tenure constrains new investments and increases the risk that local communities will lose access to forests. Another challenge is that projects with smallholders have high transaction costs. These costs can be overcome by building strong community institutions and simplifying project guidelines. To attract more projects, African governments will need to build their capacity to identify relevant opportunities. © 2008 United Nations.","Africa; Carbon markets; Carbon sequestration; CDM; Forestry; Sustainable development","agroforestry; baseline conditions; carbon sequestration; emission control; emissions trading; global warming; land tenure; pollution policy; sustainable development; Africa; East Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43049099359

Despite this significance, little is known about trends in state carbon emissions or the effectiveness of state policies in reducing emissions. This paper describes a framework for analyzing and comparing state carbon emissions performance using sectoral indicators of emissions, energy consumption and carbon intensity linked to key policy domains. The paper also describes the range of state experience across indicators during the period 1990-2001, establishing a baseline of leading, lagging and average experience against which future state and regional change can be assessed.

Reducing viscosity leads to a generally improved ocean circulation at the expense of increased numerical noise. Five domains are discussed in detail: the equatorial Pacific, where the emergence of tropical instability waves reduces the cold tongue bias; the Southern Ocean, where the Antarctic Circumpolar Current increases its kinetic energy but reduces its transport; the Arctic Ocean, where an improved representation of the Atlantic inflow leads to a better sea-ice distribution; the North Pacific, where the more realistic path of the Kuroshio leads to more realistic temperatures across the midlatitude Pacific; and the northern marginal seas, where stronger boundary currents lead to significantly less sea-ice. Although the ocean circulation and sea-ice distribution improve, the oceanic heat uptake, the poleward heat transport, and the large scale atmospheric circulation are not changed significantly. In particular, the improvements to the equatorial cold tongue did not lead to better representation of tropical precipitation or El Niño.

Neolithic pit features containing domestic midden material including broken pottery, lithics and cereal grains from two distinct parts of the quarry have provided evidence for what is interpreted as settlement and subsistence activity from the Early and Later Neolithic periods. Together with the Neolithic remains from the nearby sites at Thirlings and those recently excavated at Lanton Quarry, it provides evidence for significant, and perhaps intensive, settlement on the sand and gravel terraces of the Milfield Plain throughout the Neolithic. Indeed, these sites provide the precursors to the better known ceremonial and henge complex located nearby which probably dates to the Beaker period. Radiocarbon determinations associated with the full sequence of Neolithic pottery have been obtained from Cheviot Quarry and analysis of the residues adhering to the ceramics has provided some of the earliest evidence for dairy farming in the region, as well as information relating to other dietary and subsistence practices. Two substantial roundhouses with porches, internal hearths and pits containing domestic refuse, provide the first evidence for Late Bronze Age lowland settlement in the region. The botanical macrofossil and faunal evidence, together with the pottery residues, show clear evidence for arable and pastoral activity in a small, unenclosed farming settlement. A detailed programme of radiocarbon dating and the application of Bayesian modelling has shown that these two buildings are contemporary and date to the tenth century cal. BC. In addition to this prehistoric archaeology, three Dark Age, rectangular, post-built buildings were also discovered on the site and have been radiocarbon dated to the fifth or early sixth century cal. AD. These substantial, although heavily truncated, structures are thought to represent the homesteads of a small farming community, although the lack of material culture makes understanding their use and cultural attribution problematic. Because of their early date these buildings could have belonged to either post-Roman British inhabitants or perhaps early Anglo-Saxon mercenaries or settlers. A reconstruction of one of these buildings has been built close to the site at the nearby Maelmin Heritage Trail where it can be visited by the public. © 2008, © 2008 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80051889445

Little is known about the bias in these estimates relative to typical stove use by residents in rural communities. To assess this bias, the reductions in emissions as a result of installation of an improved wood-burning ""Patsari"" stove were quantified in both simulated kitchens and field conditions in eight homes with open fire stoves and 13 homes with Patsari stoves in Purépecha communities of Michoacán, Mexico. The results demonstrate that nominal combustion efficiencies (NCEs) of open fire cookstoves were significantly lower (p<0.001) in rural homes during daily cooking activities (89.7±2.0%) compared to WBTs in simulated kitchens (94.2±0.5%), which results in almost a doubling of the products on incomplete combustion (PICs) emitted. Since emissions from the rural residential sector are important in the modeling of atmospheric trace greenhouse gas concentrations in areas that rely on solid fuel use for primary energy provision, if these open fires reflect conditions in other areas of the world, substantial underestimation of emissions from open fires may be present in current emission databases. Conversely, NCEs for the improved Patsari stoves were significantly higher (p<0.01) in rural homes during daily cooking activities (92.3±1.3%) compared to during WBTs in simulated kitchens (87.2±4.3%), as WBTs do not reflect cooking activities in rural homes. Thus the Patsari emits 25% less PICs per kg fuelwood used than the open fire, and carbon emission reductions of Patsari and similar improved stoves are also likely underestimated. Finally, in addition to a reduction in overall particulate emissions for rural homes during daily activities, the ratio of organic carbon (OC) to elemental carbon (EC) within the aerosol fraction decreased between the open fire and improved Patsari stoves. While the overall EC contribution for the brick Patsari was reduced, the fraction of EC increased relative to OC, which makes the overall warming implication more ambiguous given current uncertainties in warming and cooling potentials of these fractions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Coal-fired power plants, including the Lower Colorado River Authority's (LCRA) Fayette Power Project (FPP) have demonstrated that the selective purchasing of coal with low mercury content can result in significant reduction of pollution. This selective activity, commonly known as ""green purchasing"", has been applied to the procurement of coal. For example, the use of low-sulfur coal from the Powder River Basin deposits of Wyoming results in the prevention of a significant amount of sulfur dioxide (SO2) releases to the atmosphere when compared to other sources of coal in the United States. This same philosophy (selective purchasing of coal) can be employed to prevent mercury emissions and substantially reduce mercury removal costs for electric utilities burning coal. Data analysis confirms that low-mercury coal is available and that selective purchasing of low-mercury coal is possible. LCRA has implemented an extensive pollution prevention program and their green purchasing efforts have been expanded to influence coal purchasing choices. Coal purchasing is limited to the Gillette Coal Field from the Powder River Basin (PRB) of Wyoming. Three sets of coal quality data which include LCRA's Coal Quality Database (CQD), a database created from the Information Collection Request (ICR) conducted by the EPA in 1999, and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Coal Quality (COALQUAL) Database were analyzed. Lab accuracy issues were found to have undermined the reliability of certain records in both the CQD and ICR databases, however, both remain valuable resources. The independent sets of coal quality data and technical reports show measurable differences in mercury concentration in coal in the Gillette Coal Field, both geographically (coal mine) and by depth (coal seam). A preliminary cost benefit analysis indicates that substantial cost savings in operating and maintaining mercury control equipment will be realized with low-mercury coal. Currently, low-mercury coal can be purchased without a significant premium. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Significant weekday-weekend differences were also found for elemental carbon in the fine size fraction, and calcium in the coarse size fraction. There was no significant weekday-weekend difference in the case of sea salt or compounds of nitrate or sulphate. Given the paucity of day of the week-specific activity data for sources other than road traffic, it has been assumed that non-traffic sources of particles are uniform throughout the week, allowing estimation of the traffic contribution to PM concentrations. While this approach may neglect a weekday-weekend difference in particulate matter from construction sources, the effect of such sources is believed to be small. Two methods (by calculation and regression) of deriving the non-vehicle contribution to the urban increment above the regional background were compared. Both resulted in values of 2.1-2.7 μg m-3 (with an estimated error of around 2 μg m-3) for the non-vehicle urban increment in PM10 measured by TEOM (gravimetric equivalent) at some urban background sites in London. The annual average traffic contribution to the urban increment is estimated as 1.6-4.4 μg m-3 for background sites in London, except Bloomsbury where the estimated traffic contribution is higher and that for non-traffic sources is lower.

This study assesses the evolutionary and ecological associations of such stomatal protection in a model system - the diverse southern hemisphere family Proteaceae. Analyses were based on the morphology of over 1400 Australian, South African, New Caledonian, New Zealand, and South American species, anatomy of over 300 of these species, and bioclimatic data from all 1109 Australian species. Ancestral state reconstruction revealed that five or six evolutionary transitions explain over 98% of the dry climate species in the family, with a few other, minor invasions of dry climates. Deep encryption, i.e., stomata in deep pits, in grooves, enclosed by tightly revolute margins or strongly overarched by cuticle, evolved at least 11 times in very dry environments. Other forms of stomatal protection (sunken but not closely encrypted stomata, papillae, and layers of hairs covering the stomata) also evolved repeatedly, but had no systematic association with dry climates. These data are evidence for a strong distinction in function, with deep encryption being an adaptation to aridity, whereas broad pits and covered stomata have more complex relations to climate.","Ancestral state reconstruction; Bioclimatic modeling; Palaeoclimate; Papillae; Phyloclimatic analysis; Proteaceae; Sclerophylly; Stomatal encryption; Water relations; Xeromorphy","adaptation; angiosperm; bioclimatology; fossil; habitat; morphology; paleoclimate; Southern Hemisphere; stomatal conductance; water relations; Africa; Australasia; Australia; Melanesia; New Caledonia [Melanesia]; New Zealand; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; South Africa; South America; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; Proteaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44249095563

We then estimated the magnitude of hydrogen production from COG in the United States and the number of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) that could potentially be fueled with the hydrogen produced from COG. Our analysis shows that this production pathway can achieve energy and greenhouse gas emission reduction benefits. This pathway is especially worth considering because first, the sources of COG are concentrated in the upper Midwest and in the Northeast United States, which would facilitate relatively cost-effective collection, transportation, and distribution of the produced hydrogen to refueling stations in these regions. Second, the amount of hydrogen that could be produced may fuel about 1.7 million cars, thus providing a vital near-term hydrogen production option for FCV applications. © 2007.","Coke oven gas; Fuel cell vehicles; Hydrogen; Well-to-wheels analysis","Coke; Diesel fuels; Fuel cells; Hydrogen production; Iron and steel plants; Ovens; Potential energy; Coke oven gas; Fuel cell vehicles; Well-to-wheels analysis; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39849111173

We compared near-isogenic barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) germplasm varying in the allelic state of a major GPC quantitative trait locus on chromosome 6, delineated by molecular markers HVM74 and ABG458 and explaining approximately 46% of the variability in this trait. High GPC was consistently associated with earlier whole-plant senescence. SDS-PAGE and immunoblot analysis of flag leaf proteins indicated earlier leaf protein [including ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco)] degradation in high-GPC germplasm. This was accompanied by enhanced availability of ammonium and glutamine in developing kernels, suggesting increased phloem retranslocation of nitrogen. Based on previous microarray analysis, we performed a detailed expression study of six leaf genes, tentatively involved in plastidial proteolysis, vacuolar proteolysis, intermediary N metabolism and N transport. All of these were upregulated in high-GPC barley, mostly around 21 to 28 days past anthesis, prior to or around the time demonstrating maximal differences in leaf protein (including Rubisco) levels. Therefore, these genes represent potential targets to manipulate grain protein accumulation. It appears likely that their functional analysis will enhance our understanding of whole-plant N recycling. Additionally, earlier leaf (photosynthetic) protein degradation may lead to reduced N carbon assimilation in high-GPC germplasm, explaining past studies demonstrating a negative correlation between GPC and yield. © Physiologia Plantarum 2008.",,"nitrogen; vegetable protein; article; barley; genetics; hydrolysis; metabolism; plant chromosome; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; Chromosomes, Plant; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Hordeum; Hydrolysis; Nitrogen; Plant Proteins; Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549089604

Folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism is essential for providing one-carbon groups for DNA methylation via DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs). Alcohol, a folate antagonist, could adversely affect one-carbon metabolism. In a case-control study of colorectal polyps, we evaluated three single nucleotide polymorphisms (-149C>T, -283T>C, -579G>T) in the promoter region of the DNMT3b gene, and a functional polymorphism in the coding region of the alcohol dehydrogenase ADH1C gene, ADH1C *2. Cases had a first diagnosis of colorectal adenomatous (n = 530) or hyperplastic (n = 202) polypsat the time of colonoscopy, whereas controls were polyp-free (n = 649). Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). There were no significant main associations between the DNMT3b or ADH1C polymorphisms and polyp risk. However, DNMT3b -149TT was associated with an increase in adenoma risk among individuals with low folate and methionine intake (OR, 2.00; 95% CI, 1.06-3.78, P interaction = 0.10). The ADH1C *2/*2 genotype wasas sociated with a possibly elevated risk for adenomatous polyps among individualswho consumed >26 g of alcohol/d (OR, 1.95; 95% CI, 0.60-6.30), whereas individuals who were wild-type for ADH1C were not at increased risk of adenoma (P interaction = 0.01). These gene-diet interactions suggest that polymorphisms relevant to DNA methylation or alcohol metabolism may play a role in colorectal carcinogenesis in conjunction with a high-risk diet.

A plasmid generating a glutathione S-transferase and plant carbonic anhydrase fusion protein (GST-CA) under the control of the tac promoter was introduced into the ECOR strains, and the quantity of the fusion protein was determined by SDS-PAGE. The foreign protein was generated at various levels, from very high (40 strains, high producers) to very low (six strains, low producers). Immunoblotting showed that the high producers expressed approximately 250-500 times more GST-CA protein than the low producers. The results of semi-quantitative RTPCR showed that the low producers generated mRNA levels comparable to those of the high producers, thereby suggesting that, at least in this case, inefficient translation is a major cause of the low production. We introduced a different plasmid, which expressed a maltose binding protein and plant guanylate kinase fusion protein (MBP-GK) into the six low producers. Interestingly, five of these expressed MBP-GK at very high levels. Thus, we conclude that the production of a particular protein from an expression vector can vary considerably, depending on the host strain.

However, HCCI is limited to a narrow band of operating region due to difficulties in controlling combustion phasing close to Top Dead Center (TDC). From literature study, Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR), Intake Temperature, Boost Pressure, Equivalence Ratio and Compressions ratios are considered as most critical parameters for HCCI control. The chemical kinetics study was conducted to understand the HCC combustion using N-heptane mechanism with 162 species and 732 reactions. At lower equivalence ratio (lean burn combustion) higher CO and HC emissions were observed. The combustion efficiency was poor at lower temperatures, which resulted in high HC and CO emissions with less than 10ppm NOx. Poor combustion was observed at low intake temperatures less than 25°C for which auto ignition temperature is less than 950K, which is threshold temperature for diesel auto ignition. Higher cylinder pressures were observed with increased boost pressure at constant equivalence ratio. Experiments show that at high boost pressures and higher EGR rates the gas exchange efficiency was poor due to higher pumping losses, hence it requires efficient EGR controller. At higher EGR rates greater than 65%, both NOx and soot emissions were close to zero, but very high CO and HC emissions with poor combustion efficiency. It was also observed that high EGR rates and lower compression ratios are most effective control parameters to control the dP (pressure rise per crank angle) below the designed value. The air fuel mixture auto-ignition is extremely sensitive to variations in intake air and EGR mixture temperatures. Low NOx emissions were observed at combustion temperature less than 2000K. Experimental results observed very low NOx (< 10ppm) low soot (less than 2%) under controlled low temperature combustion. Trends of simulation results matched with experimental results with EGR and boost pressure. This study concentrated the reasons for formation of high CO and HC emissions in HCCI engines.

The I93M mutation in ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1) is associated with familial PD, and we have previously shown that the I93M UCH-L1-transgenic mice exhibit dopaminergic cell loss. Over 90% of neurodegenerative diseases, including PD, occur sporadically. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying sporadic PD as well as PD associated with I93M UCH-L1 are largely unknown. UCH-L1 is abundant (1-5% of total soluble protein) in the brain and is a major target of oxidative/carbonyl damage associated with sporadic PD. As well, abnormal microtubule dynamics and tubulin polymerization are associated with several neurodegenerative diseases including frontotemporal dementia and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17. Here we show that familial PD-associated mutant UCH-L1 and carbonyl-modified UCH-L1 display shared aberrant properties: compared with wild-type UCH-L1, they exhibit increased insolubility and elevated interactions with multiple proteins, which are characteristics of several neurodegenerative diseases-linked mutants. Circular dichroism analyses suggest similar structural changes in both UCH-L1 variants. We further report that one of the proteins interacting with UCH-L1 is tubulin, and that aberrant interaction of mutant or carbonyl-modified UCH-L1 with tubulin modulates tubulin polymerization. These findings may underlie the toxic gain of function by mutant UCH-L1 in familial PD. Our results also suggest that the carbonyl modification of UCH-L1 and subsequent abnormal interactions of carbonyl-modified UCH-L1 with multiple proteins, including tubulin, constitute one of the causes of sporadic PD. © The Author 2008.

The gene was present as a single copy in the genome. The predicted protein sequence of spr1 is homologous to the putative cuticle-degrading serine proteases PII and Azo1 from the nematode-trapping fungus, Arthrobotrys oligospora. In the 5′ untranslated region near the initiation codon, consensus sequences to an AreA binding site, a well-known mediator of nitrogen metabolite repression in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans, a CreA binding site, a carbon response regulator in A. nidulans, and a PacC binding site, a transcription factor that responds to ambient pH signals in A. nidulans were found. However, spr1 was not regulated by carbon or nitrogen source, and exogenous protein did not induce expression of spr1. The transcription of the spr1 gene of this fungus was significantly affected by ambient pH. Based on RT-PCR, the product of the spr1 gene was not transcribed at pH 4, whereas under alkaline conditions such as pH 8 and 9, the spr1 gene was transcribed well. These results indicate that the spr1 gene is controlled only by a PacC homologue. Moreover, the expression profile of the spr1 gene corresponded with the pH-dependent physiology of this fungus. © 2006.","Monacrosporium megalosporum; pH regulate; Pine wilt; Serine protease gene","Binding sites; Enzymes; Fungi; pH effects; Physiology; Monacrosporium megalosporum; Pine wilt; Serine protease genes; Transcription factors; fungus; gene expression; genome; metabolite; nematode; pH; physiology; polymerase chain reaction; protein; Arthrobotrys oligospora; Emericella nidulans; Fungi; Monacrosporium megalosporum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37049016192

A part of this change also originates from the rapid emergence of viable small-scale distributed generation (DG) sources that are highly competitive with grid-delivered electricity in the isolated areas. In this article, the cost-effectiveness of renewable DG sources (i.e., photovoltaics, small-scale wind turbines, and biomass gasifiers) are assessed and compared with centralized generation for the case of a rural and isolated island in the western state of India using the Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewables (HOMER), developed and provided by the U.S. National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL). The model identifies a least cost set of various DG and centralized grid capacities and ranks them based on a life cycle cost.

While it is puzzling that the G77 has managed to maintain itself as a group in spite of internal differences along variables as prosperity, emissions and vulnerability to climate change, we claim that a core element behind this cohesion is that these countries share domestic governance problems as much as poverty and economic underdevelopment. Second, we discuss how recent trends of economic and political development in the third world influence the climate policy strategies of the G77 group in the future. The main factor here is the economicand social progress in states like China, India and Brazil, which separates them from the poorer and less powerful G77 states. Increasing heterogeneity along variables like governance, growth, and importance for the international economy is creating an increasing drive among the most successful G77 states towards bilateral agreements with industrialised powers. We do not foresee a departure from traditional G77 positions and membership by these states in the official climate negotiations or a departure from the Kyoto process, but an increasing reliance on bilateral agreements with industrialized countries that link considerations for energy security and the environment. The ability to gain these advantages without commitments may make these states less interested in adopting commitments for the post-Kyoto period. This is unfortunate for the LDCs and the AOSIS groups within the G77, who probably are most vulnerable to climate change. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Developing countries; G77; Negotiations","bilateral agreement; climate change; economic development; environmental policy; environmental politics; Kyoto Protocol; political development; political power; Asia; Brazil; China; Eurasia; Far East; India; South America; South Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45749088534

Based on empirical isotopic relationships between the tetrapyrrole nuclei of chlorophylls and photoautotroph cells, we estimate that the mean nitrogen isotopic composition of the entire photoautotrophic communities during these periods ranged from -2‰ to +1‰. This result strongly suggests that N2-fixation was an important primary process in photoautotrophic production during these OAEs. The estimated carbon isotopic composition of the photoautotrophs was elevated (between -20‰ and -22‰) relative to typical Cretaceous examples, indicating as much as a 5‰ reduction in the magnitude of carbon isotopic fractionation associated with photosynthesis during OAEs in the western Tethys Sea. This anomaly can be well explained if cyanobacteria were the dominant producers because they commonly conduct β-carboxylation and/or active transport of carbon substrates, resulting in reduced carbon isotopic fractionation. We therefore conclude that diazotrophic cyanobacteria were the dominant components of primary production during OAE-1a and OAE-2 in the western Tethys Sea. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Careful examination of both theoretical results and experimental data on the work functions yield several conclusions. By both theory and experiment, clean monocrystalline surfaces are verified to have Δφ{symbol}* = 0.0 eV within an error of ±0.05 eV. Next, as the density of local surface irregularities increases, the homogeneity in the work function over the whole surface area decreases and, hence, Δφ{symbol}* increases. Also, the most probable values of φ{symbol}+ and φ{symbol}e are recommended for many mono- and polycrystalline surfaces, mostly (∼70%) with a standard deviation of ±0.02-0.08 eV. Compared with the probable or typical values of φ{symbol}e accepted in influential handbooks, the most probable values of φ{symbol}e recommended here are typically (∼70%) equal to each other within a narrow gap of less than ∼0.1 eV, but some (∼20%) are different by ∼0.2 eV or more (up to ∼1 eV). Furthermore, polycrystalline surfaces of Nb, Mo, Ta, W, Re, Ir, Pt, etc. hold Δφ{symbol}* ≈ 0.3-0.8 eV since each surface has a mean value that is different between φ{symbol}+ and φ{symbol}e. Also, at the degree of monocrystallization (δm) below ∼50%, the theoretical value of Δφ{symbol}* depends little on δm and agrees well with experimental data on each polycrystalline surface. As δm increases beyond ∼80%, Δφ{symbol}* decreases rapidly to 0, showing again a good agreement between theory and experiment. In particular, those surfaces of δm &gt; 97% generally have Δφ{symbol}* ≈ 0 within the uncertainty of about ±0.05 eV, which is apparently equivalent to the usually called ""monocrystalline surfaces (δm = 100%)"". Additionally, even when both φ{symbol}+ and φ{symbol}e are changed by up to ∼1 eV by gas adsorption, Δφ{symbol}* itself remains little changed and, thus, the so-called ""work function (φ{symbol})"" recommended with polycrystalline surfaces in handbooks should not be cited as φ{symbol}+ since φ{symbol} usually coincides with φ{symbol}e except where otherwise stated. In the case of polycrystalline surfaces, φ{symbol}+ instead of φ{symbol}e should always be adopted to analyze accurately data on any positive ion emission, irrespective of its process or mechanism. Also, those metals covered with a two-dimensional graphitic film usually have φ{symbol}+ ≈ φ{symbol}e ≈ 4.5 eV, which corresponds to monocrystal graphite. Finally, for any species of mono- and polycrystalline surfaces, both theory and experiment verify φ{symbol}- = φ{symbol}e and hence, Δφ{symbol}** = 0. The features of dissociative self-surface ionization of heated ionic crystals are outlined together with typical data on φ{symbol}+, φ{symbol}- and φ{symbol}e, which originate from the thermionic properties of the crystal itself. A brief description is given to typical methods and techniques to prepare clean and/or monocrystalline surfaces, to determine local work functions of real monocrystalline surfaces, and also to form graphitic carbon films on various surfaces. In 12 tables and 29 figures based on 1350 references published to date (mainly ∼1970-2006), we show data on each work function of mono- and polycrystalline surfaces and their temperature coefficient, as well as their dependence upon experimental conditions. Also, we illustrate a comparison of each work function between theory and experiment and the most probable values of φ{symbol}+ and φ{symbol}e(=φ{symbol}-), which are generally citable as reliable references. A comparison between the most probable values (φ{symbol}e) recommended here and the probable or typical ones (φ{symbol}) accepted elsewhere are shown, along with working conditions for keeping φ{symbol}+ as high as possible for promoting positive ionization efficiency. Also, we present relationships between φ{symbol}+ and ionic desorption energies, and typical data on negative ion emission due to thermal stimulation.

For soil chemistry research, scaling from the plot to the region is especially difficult due to high spatial variability at all scales. We used a hierarchical Bayesian model of plot-scale soil nutrient pools to predict storage of soil organic carbon (oC), inorganic carbon (iC), total nitrogen (N), and available phosphorus (avP) in a 7962-km2 area including the Phoenix, Arizona, USA, metropolitan area and its desert and agricultural surroundings. The Bayesian approach was compared to a traditional approach that multiplied mean values for urban mesic residential, urban xeric residential, nonresidential urban, agricultural, and desert areas by the aerial coverage of each land-use type. Both approaches suggest that oC, N, and avP are correlated with each other and are higher (in g/m2) in mesic residential and agricultural areas than in deserts or xeric residential areas. In addition to traditional biophysical variables, cultural variables related to impervious surface cover, tree cover, and turfgrass cover were significant in regression models predicting the regional distribution of soil properties. We estimate that 1140 Gg of oC have accumulated in human-dominated soils of this region, but a significant portion of this new C has a very short mean residence time in mesic yards and agricultural soils. For N, we estimate that 130 Gg have accumulated in soils, which explains a significant portion of ""missing N"" observed in the regional N budget. Predictions for iC differed between the approaches because the Bayesian approach predicted iC as a function of elevation while the traditional approach employed only land use. We suggest that Bayesian scaling enables models that are flexible enough to accommodate the diverse factors controlling soil chemistry in desert, urban, and agricultural ecosystems and, thus, may represent an important tool for ecological scaling that spans land-use types. Urban planners and city managers attempting to reduce C emissions and N pollution should consider ways that landscape choices and impervious surface cover affect city-wide soil C, N, and P storage. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","CAP LTER; Hierarchical Bayes; Phoenix, Arizona; Scaling; Soil inorganic carbon; Soil nitrogen; Soil organic carbon; Soil phosphorus; Urban ecology","agricultural ecosystem; Bayesian analysis; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; comparative study; desert soil; metropolitan area; phosphorus; regression analysis; residence time; soil carbon; soil chemistry; soil nitrogen; soil nutrient; soil organic matter; soil property; spatial variation; urban ecosystem; agriculture; article; Bayes theorem; ecosystem; soil; Agriculture; Bayes Theorem; Ecosystem; Soil; Arizona; North America; Phoenix; United States; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949084977

When emissions models and vehicle fleet-related planning assumptions change substantially, but for a variety of reasons the State Implementation Plan and its emissions budgets do not, a mismatch arises. The SIP Currency approach addresses problems that arise when the latest emissions and transportation modeling tools and planning assumptions are used to estimate on-road vehicle emissions, but the resulting estimates are compared to outdated emissions targets. Translating emissions estimates into the currency of emissions estimates included in older air quality plans provides a way to ensure continued improvement in air quality while preventing unintended disruption of transportation planning.

While mainstream media have been found to inadequately report on this issue in the United States, little research has examined how alternative media frame climate change, or how mainstream press in other countries are dealing with this important issue. In 2007, Professor Tim O'Riordan, the British Sustainability Commissioner and an advisor to British Prime Minister Tony Blair, gave a public speech arguing that climate change must be framed not as a sacrifice or a penalty but as an opportunity to benefit the future. Shortly after, Dr. Michael Nisbet and Chris Mooney wrote a much discussed article in Science that argued scientists must de-emphasize the facts' and focus more on 'morality' if important scientific problems are going to have any hope of abating. If such moralistic frames are to be found in the press, one might expect to see their presence initially in alternative outlets or in the mainstream press of countries that have a more receptive policy toward combating climate change.

It led to much discussion and debate not only about its contribution to the global CH4 budget but also about the authenticity of the observation itself. Previous results suggested that methoxyl groups of the abundant plant structural component pectin might play a key role in the in situ formation process of CH4. Here, this effect is investigated using an isotope labelling study. • Polysaccharides, pectin and polygalacturonic acid, with varying degrees of trideuterium-labelled methyl groups in the methoxyl moieties, were investigated for CH4 formation under UV irradiation and heating. • A strong deuterium signal in the emitted CH4 was observed from these labelled polysaccharides. • Results clearly demonstrate that ester methyl groups of pectin can serve as a precursor of CH4, supporting the idea of a novel chemical route of CH4 formation in plants under oxic environmental conditions. © The Authors (2008).","Climate; Greenhouse gas; Stable hydrogen isotopes; Sugars; Vegetation","deuterium; methane; pectin; polygalacturonic acid; deuterium; greenhouse gas; methane; oxic conditions; polysaccharide; stable isotope; sugar; ultraviolet radiation; article; atmosphere; chemistry; esterification; heat; isotope labeling; light; metabolism; methodology; plant; radiation exposure; Atmosphere; Deuterium; Esterification; Heat; Isotope Labeling; Light; Methane; Pectins; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38649093887

The mobilization of deep carbon stock of the frozen Pleistocene soil in the case of rapid stepwise increase of atmospheric temperature was considered. In this work, we adapted the model to be used also for floodplain tundra sites and to account for the processes in the soil active layer. The new processes taken into account are litter input and decomposition, plant-mediated transport of methane, and leaching of exudates from plant roots. The SRES-A2 transient climate warming scenario of the IPSL CM4 climate model is used to study the carbon fluxes from the carbon-rich Pleistocene soil with seasonal active-layer carbon cycling on top of it. For a point to the southwest from the western branch of Yedoma Ice Complex, where the climate warming is strong enough to trigger self-sustainable decomposition processes, about 256 kgC m-2, or 70% of the initial soil carbon stock under present-day climate conditions, are emitted to the atmosphere in about 120 yr, including 20 kgC m-2 released as methane. The total average flux of CO2 and methane emissions to the atmosphere during this time is of 2.1 kgC m-2 yr-1. Within the Yedoma, whose most part of the territory remains relatively cold, the emissions are much smaller: 0.2 kgC m-2 yr-1 between 2050 and 2100 for Yakutsk area. In a test case with saturated upper-soil meter, when the runoff is insufficient to evacuate the meltwater, 0.05 kgCH4 m-2 yr-1 on average are emitted as methane during 250 yr starting from 2050. The latter can translate to the upper bound of 1 GtC yr-1 in CO2 equivalent from the 1 million km2 area of the Yedoma. © Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Munksgaard.",,"active layer; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; decomposition; global warming; methane; permafrost; tundra; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549160156

Poultry processing wastewater is the cumulative wastewater stream generated during the processing of poultry following primary and secondary physical screening (typically to 500 μm) that removes gross offal. Composite samples of PPW from 3 broiler slaughter plants (southeast United States) were collected over 8 consecutive weeks.

At each plant, a single 72-L composite sample was collected using an automatic sampler programmed to collect 1 L of wastewater every 20 min for 24 h during one normal processing day each week. Each composite sample was thoroughly mixed, and 60 L was passed through a series of sieves (2.0 mm, 1.0 mm, 500 μm, and 53 μm).

The purpose of the study is to assess whether there are significant benefits from the higher resolution simulation compared to the lower resolution simulation associated with the role of topography. The LGM simulations were forced with modified CLIMAP sea ice distribution and sea surface temperatures (SST) reduced by 1°C, ice sheet topography, reduced CO2, and 21,000 BP orbital parameters. The high-resolution model captures modern climate reasonably well, in particular the distribution of heavy precipitation in the tropical Pacific. For the ice age case, surface temperature simulated by the high-resolution model agrees better with those of proxy estimates than does the low-resolution model. Despite the fact that tropical SSTs were only 2.1°C less than the control run, there are many lowland tropical land areas 4-6°C colder than present. Comparison of T170 model results with the best constrained proxy temperature estimates (noble gas concentrations in groundwater) now yield no significant differences between model and observations. There are also significant upland temperature changes in the best resolved tropical mountain belt (the Andes). We provisionally attribute this result in part as resulting from decreased lateral mixing between ocean and land in a model with more model grid cells. A longstanding model-data discrepancy therefore appears to be resolved without invoking any unusual model physics. The response of the Asian summer monsoon can also be more clearly linked to local geography in the high-resolution model than in the low-resolution model; this distinction should enable more confident validation of climate proxy data with the high-resolution model. Elsewhere, an inferred salinity increase in the subtropical North Atlantic may have significant implications for ocean circulation changes during the LGM. A large part of the Amazon and Congo Basins are simulated to be substantially drier in the ice age - consistent with many (but not all) paleo data. These results suggest that there are considerable benefits derived from high-resolution model regarding regional climate responses, and that observationalists can now compare their results with models that resolve geography at a resolution comparable to that which the proxy data represent. © Springer-Verlag 2008.",,"atmospheric general circulation model; ice sheet; Last Glacial Maximum; oceanic circulation; proxy climate record; regional climate; sea ice; sea surface temperature; simulation; temperature anomaly; topography; Africa; Amazon Basin; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Congo Basin; South America; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43749099054

COH values are a measure of the attenuation of light by particles collected on a white filter, and available data indicate they are proportional to BC concentrations measured using the conventional aethalometer. Monthly averaged BC concentrations are up to five times greater in winter than summer, and, consequently, so is the population's exposure to BC. The seasonal cycle in BC concentrations is similar for all Bay Area sites, most likely due to area-wide decreased pollutant dispersion during wintertime. A strong weekly cycle is also evident, with weekend concentrations significantly lower than weekday concentrations, consistent with decreased diesel traffic volume on weekends. The weekly cycle suggests that, in the Bay Area, diesel vehicle emissions are the dominant source of BC aerosol. Despite the continuous increase in diesel fuel consumption in California, annual Bay Area average BC concentrations decreased by a factor of ∼3 from the late 1960s to the early 2000s. Based on estimated annual BC concentrations, on-road diesel fuel consumption, and recent measurements of on-road diesel vehicle BC emissions, diesel BC emission factors decreased by an order of magnitude over the study period. Reductions in the BC emission factor reflect improved engine technology, emission controls and changes in diesel fuel composition. A new BC monitoring network is needed to continue tracking ambient BC trends because the network of COH monitors has been retired.","Aethalometer; Air pollution trends; Air quality; Black carbon; Coefficient of haze; Diesel vehicle; Motor vehicle emissions; Particulate matter","Aerosols; Air quality; Diesel locomotives; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Aethalometers; Air pollution trends; Diesel vehicles; Haze coefficient; Motor vehicle emissions; Carbon; carbon; diesel fuel; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; black carbon; concentration (composition); diesel; dispersion; haze; measurement method; temporal variation; traffic congestion; traffic emission; air pollution; air quality; air sampling; article; atmospheric dispersion; diesel engine; energy consumption; exhaust gas; haze; meteorology; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; soot; traffic; United States; California; North America; San Francisco Bay; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38049047529

We concentrate on studying water security of five countries in the region: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. These countries share the same recent history of being a part of the Soviet Union, and inherit their water regulation from the planned economy of that time that was targeted at maximizing agricultural output through diverting the river flow into an extensive and largely ineffective network of irrigation canals. The current water crisis is largely due to human activity; however the region is also strongly impacted by the climate. Climate change will contribute to water problems, escalating irrigation demand during the drought period, and increasing water loss with evaporation. The future of the countries of the Aral Sea basin then depends on both the regional scenario of water management policy and a global scenario of climate change, and is integrated with global socioeconomic scenarios. We formulate a set of regional policy scenarios (""Business as Usual"", ""Falling Behind"" and ""Closing the Gap"") and demonstrate how each of them corresponds to IPCC SRES scenarios, the latter used as an input to the General Circulation Models (GCMs). Then we discuss the relative effectiveness of the introduced scenarios for mitigating water problems in the region, taking into account the adaptation through changing water demand for agriculture. Finally, we introduce the results of multimodel analysis of GCM climate projections, especially in relation to the change in precipitation and frequency of droughts, and discuss the impact of climate change on future development of the region. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We conducted a modelling analysis to assess whether those changes in soil carbon, especially the interaction with rainfall, could be understood through consideration of nitrogen balances. The study was based on simulations with the whole-system ecophysiological model CenW which allowed explicit modelling of both carbon and nitrogen pools and their fluxes through plants and soil organic matter. We found that in a modelled coniferous forest without excess water input, total system nitrogen stocks remained similar to pre-forestation values because there were few pathways for nitrogen losses, and without biological nitrogen fixation or fertiliser inputs, gains were restricted to small inputs from atmospheric deposition. However, tree biomass and the litter layer accumulated considerable amounts of nitrogen. This accumulation of nitrogen came at the expense of depleting soil nitrogen stocks. With the change from input of grass litter that is low in lignin to forest litter with higher lignin concentration, organic-matter C:N ratios increased so that more carbon could be stored per unit of soil nitrogen which partly negated the effect of reduced nitrogen stocks. The increase in C:N ratios was initially confined to the surface litter layer because of slow transfer of material to the mineral soil. Over a period of decades, soil C:N ratios eventually increased in the soil as well. Simulations with different amounts of precipitation showed that greater amounts of nitrogen were leached from systems where water supply exceeded the plants' requirements. Reduced nitrogen stocks then caused a subsequent reduction in soil organic carbon stocks. These simulations thus provided a consistent explanation for the observation of greater losses of soil organic carbon in high-rainfall systems after converting pastures to forests. More generally, the simulations showed that explicit modelling of the nitrogen cycle can put important constraints on possible changes in soil-carbon stocks that may occur after land-use change. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The present work reports findings from a site near Canberra, Australia, where a pine forest (Pinus radiata) was planted onto a former unimproved pasture site. We report a number of detailed observations seeking to understand the basis of the decline in soil C stocks. This is supported by simulations using the whole-ecosystem carbon and nitrogen cycling model CenW 3.1. The model indicated that over the first 18 years after forest establishment, the site lost about 5.5 t C ha-1 and 588 kgN ha-1 from the soil. The C:N ratio of soil organic matter did not change in a systematic manner over the observational period. Carbon and nitrogen stocks contained in the biomass of the 18-year old pine stand exceeded that of the pasture by 88 t C ha-1 and 393 kgN ha-1. An additional 6.1 t C ha-1 and 110 kgN ha-1 accumulated in above-ground litter. These changes, together with the vertical distribution of carbon and nitrogen in the soil, agreed well with the observation at the site. It was assumed that over 18 years, there was also a loss of 86 kgN ha-1 from the ecosystem because of normal gaseous losses during nitrogen turn-over and a small amount of nitrogen leaching. Those losses could not be replenished in the pine system without symbiotic biological nitrogen fixation, and there were no fertiliser additions. A simple mass balance approach indicated that the amount of nitrogen accumulating in plant biomass and the litter layer plus the assumed nitrogen loss from the site matched the amount of nitrogen lost from the soil organic nitrogen pool. This reduction in soil nitrogen, together with an unchanged C:N ratio, provided a simple and internally consistent explanation for the observed reduction of soil carbon after reforestation. It supports the general notion that trends in soil carbon upon land-use change can often be controlled by the possible fates of available soil nitrogen. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In particular, to test the relative roles of functional relationships between birds and woody plants, and the direct and indirect environmental effects on broad-scale species richness of both groups. Location: Kenya. Methods: Based on comprehensive range maps of all birds and woody plants (native species > 2.5 m in height) in Kenya, we mapped species richness of both groups. We distinguished species richness of four different avian frugivore guilds (obligate, partial, opportunistic and non-frugivores) and fleshy-fruited and non-fleshy-fruited woody plants. We used structural equation modelling and spatial regressions to test for effects of functional relationships (resource-consumer interactions and vegetation structural complexity) and environment (climate and habitat heterogeneity) on the richness patterns. Results: Path analyses suggested that bird and woody plant species richness are linked via functional relationships, probably driven by vegetation structural complexity rather than trophic interactions. Bird species richness was determined in our models by both environmental variables and the functional relationships with woody plants. Direct environmental effects on woody plant richness differed from those on bird richness, and different avian consumer guilds showed distinct responses to climatic factors when woody plant species richness was included in path models. Main conclusions: Our results imply that bird and woody plant diversity are linked at this scale via vegetation structural complexity, and that environmental factors differ in their direct effects on plants and avian trophic guilds. We conclude that climatic factors influence broad-scale tropical bird species richness in large part indirectly, via effects on plants, rather than only directly as often assumed. This could have important implications for future predictions of animal species richness in response to climate change. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Autoregressive model; Biodiversity; Community assembly; Cross-taxon congruence; Frugivory; Indirect effects; Kenya; Plant-animal interactions; Species-energy theory; Trophic guild","biodiversity; bird; ecosystem function; environmental effect; frugivory; functional group; plant-herbivore interaction; spatial variation; species diversity; species richness; trophic structure; woody plant; Africa; East Africa; Kenya; Sub-Saharan Africa; Animalia; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42049093635

The product of ptca1, PtCA1, was also shown to be localized to the chloroplast as clumped particles. Both ptca1 and 2 encode putative N-terminal signal peptides of 19 amino acids. In the present study, the C-terminal region of the 46 amino acid presequence of PtCA1 (Pre46AA) was truncated to investigate the function of this region. DNA sequences, which encode the N-terminal 19, 23, 24, 34 or 44 polypeptides of Pre46AA, were fused with the sequence that encodes the mature protein, PtCA1. These constructs were fused with the enhanced-green fluorescent protein gene, egfp, and expressed in P. tricornutum. Fluorescent microscopy of expressed green fluorescent protein (GFP) showed that presequences of PtCA1 longer than the initial N-terminal 23 amino acids successfully sorted the PtCA1::GFP fusion into chloroplasts, whereas those shorter than 23 amino acids did not. These results indicate that the four amino acids after the endoplasmic reticulum signal peptide cleavage site are required as a chloroplast-targeting signal. Ala 19 Phe20 is known to be the highly conserved transit motif among presequences of nuclear-encoded chloroplastic proteins in diatoms; however, the corresponding amino acid sequence deduced from the ptca2 was Ala19 Leu20. Substitution of Phe20 in PtCA1 with Leu did not alter the localization of PtCA1, indicating that the chloroplast-targeting motif possesses some alternative pattern and that PtCA2 could be sorted to chloroplast via a process similar to that of PtCA1. The ptca2 cDNA was isolated, fused at the 3′ terminus with the egfp and introduced into P. tricornutum cells. Expressed PtCA2::GFP fusion was clearly localized by chlorophyll fluorescence in the chloroplast of P. tricornutum as clumped particles, which was strikingly similar to the localization of PtCA1. © Physiologia Plantarum 2008.",,"algal protein; carbonate dehydratase; enhanced green fluorescent protein; green fluorescent protein; hybrid protein; isoenzyme; sea water; amino acid sequence; biological model; biology; chloroplast; conference paper; diatom; enzymology; fluorescence microscopy; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; protein transport; Algal Proteins; Amino Acid Sequence; Carbonic Anhydrases; Chloroplasts; Diatoms; Green Fluorescent Proteins; Isoenzymes; Marine Biology; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Protein Transport; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Seawater; Bacillariophyta; Nitzschia alba; Phaeodactylum tricornutum",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42049113049

Location: Trans-Andean transect (53° S), southern Patagonia Material and Methods: Floristic composition, peat characteristics (water level, decomposition, pH, total nitrogen, total carbon, ash content and plant available P, K, Na, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, Zn, and Al) and climatic constraints of ombrotrophic peatlands were measured at 82 plots along a gradient of increasing distance from the Pacific Ocean. Results: Climatic constraints and biogeochemical peat characteristics significantly change with increasing distance from the Pacific. Peatland vegetation shifted from hyperoceanic blanket bogs dominated by cushion forming vascular plants to the west to Sphagnum bogs to the east. Climatic and biogeochemical variables explained a large proportion of the floristic variation along the first DCA axis. The second axis represented a water level gradient. When 'distance to the Pacific' was defined as a covariable in partial CCA, the proportion of variance explained declined for most other variables, especially in the case of annual precipitation and exchangeable base cations and related traits. The differences in biogeochemical characteristics related to peat were mainly attributed to the input of sea-borne cations. Conclusions: While variation in vegetation composition along a longitudinal gradient crossing the southern Andes was attributed to climatic constraints as expected, vegetation composition was also strongly affected by the biogeochemical characteristics of peat. Sea spray was of high ecological importance to peat chemistry and, consequently, to floristic composition. Presumably, south Patagonian peat bogs represent a glimpse of pre-industrial environments, so that these peat bogs may act as reference systems with respect to atmospheric inputs in mire ecology research. © IAVS; Opulus Press.","Base cations; Blanket bog; CCA; Chile; Cushion bog; Ordination; Raised bog; Sea spray; Sphagnum","biogeochemistry; community composition; floristics; longitudinal gradient; ombrotrophic environment; peatland; Chile; Pacific Ocean; Patagonia; South America; Sphagnum; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43649095841

Models that explicitly simulate hurricanes are needed to study the influence of warming ocean temperatures on Atlantic hurricane activity, complementing empirical approaches. Our regional climate model of the Atlantic basin reproduces the observed rise in hurricane counts between 1980 and 2006, along with much of the interannual variability, when forced with observed sea surface temperatures and atmospheric conditions. Here we assess, in our model system, the changes in large-scale climate that are projected to occur by the end of the twenty-first century by an ensemble of global climate models, and find that Atlantic hurricane and tropical storm frequencies are reduced. At the same time, near-storm rainfall rates increase substantially.

In a unicellular green alga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a regulatory factor CCM1 is indispensable for the regulation of the CCM by sensing CO2 availability. CCM1 has two putative zinc-binding domains with several conserved cysteine and histidine residues in its N-terminal region. To determine whether the domains actually bind zinc atoms, the N-terminal parts of CCM1 were expressed as glutathione S-transferase fusion proteins and subjected to atomic absorption spectrometry. It was found that 1 mol of zinc is bound to 1 mol of amino acid regions 1-71 and 72-101 of CCM1, respectively. In the case of the site-directed mutant proteins, H54Y, C77V and C80V, the zinc-binding ability was lost. Physiological analyses of the transgenic Chlamydomonas cells harboring a mutated Ccm1 gene revealed that amino acid residues such as C36, C41, H54, C77, C80, H90 and C93 were indispensable for induction of the CCM in response to Ci-limiting stress conditions. Size exclusion chromatography followed by immunoblot analyses indicated that CCM1 is present as a protein complex of approximately 290-580 kDa independent of Ci availability. © The Author 2008.

The measurements were obtained by etching a coated quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) with a low energy ion beam. The material properties of the carbon targets were characterized with a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and Raman spectroscopy. C sputtering yields measured under Ar + and Xe + bombardment at normal incidence displayed satisfactory agreement with previously published data over an energy range of 200 eV-1 keV. For Xe + ions, the dependence of the yields on angle of incidence θ was determined for 0° ≤ θ ≤ 80°. Over this range, an increase in C sputtering yield by a factor of 4.8 was observed, with the peak in yield occurring at 70°. This is a much higher variation compared to Xe + → Mo yields under similar conditions, a difference that may be attributed to higher scattering of the incident particles transverse to the beam direction than in the case of Xe + → C. In addition, the variation of the yields with θ was not strongly energy dependent.

For this method of evaluation, it is not necessary to know the reaction equilibrium constant, the experiment start time, or the initial and final steady-state pH probe readings. The experimental procedure is based on Hill's recent publication (Ind. Eng. Chem. Res. 2006, 45, 5796). Hill reported a decrease in kLa following the addition of salt during carbon dioxide absorption in a well-mixed reactor and explained it as the result of ionic charge effects reducing the ability of carbon dioxide molecules to diffuse away from the surface. Generally, oxygen absorption from air is preferred because the solubility of oxygen is low and, thus, so will be the gas-phase depletion. In such experiments, the mass transfer coefficients are less affected by gas-phase residence time distribution and by bubble-size distribution. The solubility of carbon dioxide is 26 times higher than that of oxygen, which can lead to significant gas concentration changes. Thus, the kLa values, measured using absorption of diluted carbon dioxide, are more likely to be distorted by driving force errors caused by the use of an inappropriate gas-mixing model. Using a stirred cell, the interfacial area of which is known, the mass transfer coefficients of oxygen and carbon dioxide in water and in a salt solution were compared. The mass transfer coefficients obtained for oxygen agreed with, or were slightly superior to, the coefficients obtained for carbon dioxide, which corresponds with the lower molecular diffusivity of CO2. The mass transfer coefficients of carbon dioxide obtained in salt solution were not significantly lower than those obtained in pure water, which is in strong agreement with the literature but contradicts the results reported by Hill. It is shown that Hill's findings may be the result of his use of both an inaccurate gas-mixing model (no depletion of gas) and an imprecise reaction term in his equations. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Absorption; Mass transfer; Mathematical models; Oxygen; pH effects; Sodium chloride; Supersaturation; PH probe; Volumetric mass transfer coefficient; Well-mixed reactor; Carbon dioxide; Absorption; Carbon dioxide; Mass transfer; Mathematical models; Oxygen; pH effects; Sodium chloride; Supersaturation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40449142577

The region is characterized by a net CO2 Sink (2.7 ± 0.8 mol CO2 m-2 yr-1) that is mediated to a major extent by biological carbon drawdown during spring/summer. During wintertime, surface waters approach equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. Oxygen changes from marked undersaturation of about 6% during wintertime to strong supersaturation by up to 10% during the spring/summer bloom. Overall, the central Labrador Sea acts as an O2 Sink of 10.0 ± 3.1 mol m-2 yr-1. The combined CO2 and O2 sink functions give rise to a sizable APO flux of 13.0 ± 4.0 mol m-2 yr-1 into surface waters of the central Labrador Sea. A mixed layer carbon budget yields a net community production of 4.0 ± 0.8 mol C m-2 during the 2005 productive season about one third of which appears to undergo subsurface respiration in a depth range that is reventilated during the following winter. The timing of the spring bloom is discussed and eddies from the West Greenland Current are thought to be associated with the triggering of the bloom. Finally, we use CO2 and O2 mixed layer dynamics during the 2005 spring bloom to evaluate a suite of prominent wind speed-dependent parameterizations for the gas transfer coefficient. We find very good agreement with those parameterizations which yield higher transfer coefficients at wind speeds above 10 m s-1.

It represents a range of environmental hazards and will affect populations where the current burden of climate-sensitive disease is high - such as the urban poor in low- and middle-income countries. Understanding the current impact of weather and climate variability on the health of urban populations is the first step towards assessing future impacts. In this paper, we have reviewed the scientific evidence for the effects of temperature, rainfall and extreme events on human health, in particular the impacts of heat waves and floods. The methods for assessing the risks of climate change are undergoing development, and there is a need to shift the focus from global and regional to local studies. Sectoral approaches to climate change impact assessments often ignore the effects on health. There is a need to better describe the risks to health from extreme weather events as well as improve the effectiveness of public health interventions. Improving the resilience of cities to climate change also requires improvements in the urban infrastructure, but such improvements may not be achieved quickly enough to avoid an increased burden of disease due to global climate change.","Cities; Climate change; Diarrhoeal disease; Floods; Heat stroke; Heat waves; Mortality","climate change; climate variation; diarrheal disease; health impact; health risk; low income population; mortality; public health; risk assessment; urban climate; urban population; Asia; Eurasia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41049093045

In order to calculate dose distributions for this therapy, biophysical beam characteristics was investigated and defined as input into the treatment planning software. Method and Materials: Uniform fields of the vertical and the horizontal carbon‐ion beams from a synchrotron were shaped with the passive beam shaping systems. Apertures and range compensators (RC) were designed for individual patients. We used a commercially available treatment planning system for proton therapy, which was customized to our carbon‐ion beams. The physical depth dose profiles were measured with an ionization chamber and LET depth profiles were calculated. Variation of the survival curves with LET for HMV‐I cell were obtained experimentally. The range modulating ridge filters were designed to produce the spread‐out Bragg peaks with region of uniform HMV‐I cell killing for delivery of 70 Gray‐Equivalent in five fractions. The beam penumbra was defined based on measurements with radiographic films and calculations. The lateral penumbra was estimated to be 1/3.6 of the proton beam. Dose distributions were calculated with broad beam and pencil beam algorisms using these defined beam data. Results: The dose distributions calculated in water for typical irradiation arrangements showed the lateral penumbra width (80–20%) to be less than 0.15 cm along full penetration depth. During two years, more than twenty patients have been treated with two fractions of vertical beams and three fractions of horizontal beams. With the use of RC, the dose distributions showed high conformity to tumors with low dose to organs at risk such as I‐C body and disk. Conclusion: The biophysical beam characteristic for clinical dose calculation was described. The employed bio‐clinical model could be evaluated by clinical outcome. © 2008, American Association of Physicists in Medicine.

On the other hand, numerous studies have indicated that mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons, which are thought to be involved in rewarding and reinforcement processes, play important roles in the supraspinal pain-suppression system. We hypothesized that the mesolimbic dopaminergic system is involved in the antinociceptive effect of N2O. METHODS: Adult male Fischer rats were used in this study. To examine whether the dopaminergic system is activated by N2O, frozen sections of the ventral tegmental area of rats exposed to 75% N2O were double-stained for c-Fos and tyrosine hydroxylase. To clarify whether the dopaminergic system is involved in the antinociceptive action of N2O, saline or raclopride, a dopamine D2-like receptor antagonist, was injected into the nucleus accumbens (NAc) shell region. After exposure to 25% oxygen-75% nitrogen or 25% oxygen-75% N2O for 30 min, rats were subjected to formalin test, and the spinal cord was examined immunohistochemically. RESULTS: Exposure to 75% N2O increased c-Fos expression in tyrosine hydroxylasepositive cells in the ventral tegmental area. Raclopride, injected into the NAc shell region, attenuated the antinociceptive effect of N 2O in the formalin test, and blocked the suppressive effect of N 2O on the formalin-induced c-Fos expression in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord by N2O. CONCLUSION: It is possible that inhalation of N2O activates mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons, and that the antinociceptive effect of N2O is at least partially mediated by dopamine D2-like receptors in the NAc shell region. © 2008 International Anesthesia Research Society.",,"dopamine 2 receptor; dopamine 2 receptor blocking agent; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; oxygen; protein c fos; raclopride; sodium chloride; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; analgesic agent; dopamine 2 receptor; dopamine receptor blocking agent; formaldehyde; nitrous oxide; protein c fos; raclopride; tyrosine 3 monooxygenase; animal behavior; animal experiment; animal tissue; antinociception; article; brain tissue; controlled study; drug effect; drug mechanism; frozen section; immunohistochemistry; male; mesolimbic dopaminergic system; nociception; nonhuman; nucleus accumbens; priority journal; rat; spinal cord dorsal horn; ventral tegmentum; animal; chemically induced disorder; disease model; enzymology; Fischer 344 rat; genetics; metabolism; microinjection; nucleus accumbens; pain; pain assessment; time; upregulation; ventral tegmentum; Analgesics; Animals; Behavior, Animal; Disease Models, Animal; Dopamine Antagonists; Formaldehyde; Male; Microinjections; Nitrous Oxide; Nucleus Accumbens; Pain; Pain Measurement; Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos; Raclopride; Rats; Rats, Inbred F344; Receptors, Dopamine D2; Time Factors; Tyrosine 3-Monooxygenase; Up-Regulation; Ventral Tegmental Area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649095684

Microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were extracted from 0-20, 20-40 and 40-60 cm depth intervals from agricultural soils and analysed for their stable carbon isotopes (δ13C values). The soils had been subjected to a vegetation change from C3 (δ13C≈-29.3‰) to C4 plants (δ13C≈-12.5‰) 40 years previously, which allowed us to trace the carbon flow from plant-derived input (litter, roots, and root exudates) into microbial PLFA. While bulk soil organic matter (SOM) reflected ≈12% of the C4-derived carbon in top soil (0-20 cm) and 3% in deeper soil (40-60 cm), the PLFA had a much higher contribution of C4 carbon of about 64% in 0-20 cm and 34% in 40-60 cm. This implies a much faster turnover time of carbon in the microbial biomass compared to bulk SOM. The isotopic signature of bulk SOM and PLFA from C4 cultivated soil decreases with increasing soil depth (-23.7‰ to -25.0‰ for bulk SOM and -18.3‰ to -23.3‰ for PLFA), which demonstrates decreasing influence of the isotopic signature of the new C4 vegetation with soil depth. In terms of soil microbial carbon sources this clearly shows a high percentage of C4 labelled and thus young plant carbon as microbial carbon source in topsoils. With increasing soil depth this percentage decreases and SOM is increasingly used as microbial carbon source. Among all PLFA that were associated to different microbial groups it could be observed that (a) depended on availability, Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria prefer plant-derived carbon as carbon source, however, (b) Gram-positive bacteria use more SOM-derived carbon sources while Gram-negative bacteria use more plant biomass. This tendency was observed in all three-depth intervals. However, our results also show that microorganisms maintain their preferred carbon sources independent on soil depth with an isotopic shift of 3-4‰ from 0-20 to 40-60 cm soil depth. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting signal resembles the so-called Atlantic multidecadal oscillation (AMO) and is presumably associated with intrinsic dynamics of the oceanic thermohaline circulation (THC). While certain phases of the oscillation are dominated by the anomalies in the North Atlantic region, other phases are characterized by global teleconnections to the North Pacific Ocean, tropical Atlantic Ocean, as well as the Southern Ocean. In particular, natural variability of sea surface temperature in the Atlantic hurricanes' main development region has a peak-to-peak amplitude comparable in magnitude to this region's surface temperature increase over the past century, for all seasons, Evidence suggests that the AMO influence on secular trends in the global-mean surface temperature can arise via direct, regional contribution to the surface temperature evolution, as well as via an indirect route linked to variability of the oceanic uptake of CO2 associated with AMO-related THC changes.© 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric temperature; Carbon dioxide; Hurricanes; Climate variability; Multimodel ensemble mean; Sea surface temperature; Thermohaline circulation; Climate change; climate modeling; climate oscillation; climate variation; data set; decadal variation; sea surface temperature; surface temperature; teleconnection; thermohaline circulation; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Tropical); Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North); Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44349091022

Temperature increase was recently shown to lead to enhanced drought in the Netherlands. In contrast, experimental evidence shows that elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations tend to reduce stomatal opening in plants. This leads to lower transpiration rates, although models of atmospheric and soil water feedback show that reductions may be smaller than expected from stomatal closure. We combined the various effects and feedbacks. First, we inferred partial corrections on 'crop factors' used in simple evaporation equations such as Makkink's, for a range of crops and vegetation types in the Netherlands. Second, we applied these corrected factors to infer the likely effects on water deficits in the Netherlands, using a coupled set of hydrological models and national climate scenarios. The combined effects of CO2 on evapotranspiration are generally modest, between a reduction of a few percent for short crops to about 15% for tall, rough vegetation. These reductions are, however, of comparable but opposite magnitude to predicted temperature-induced increases in evapotranspiration. We show that, if combined within the coupled hydrological model, the CO2-effect would lead to a much-reduced desiccating effect of climate change. In general, it is argued that, especially for sub-regional spatial scales and seasonal time-scales, CO2 is likely to be a significant factor in the water balance even of relatively wet regions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We tested the hypothesis that increasing the ratio of Rubisco activase to Rubisco catalytic site concentration would increase the activation state of Rubisco at high temperatures. We measured photosynthetic gas exchange, in vivo electron transport (J) and the activation state of Rubisco between 15 and 45°C, at 38 and 76 Pa ambient CO 2, in wild-type (WT) and anti-rbcS tobacco. The Rubisco content of the anti-rbcS lines was 30% (S7-1) or 6% (S7-2) of WT, but activase levels were the same in the three genotypes. Anti-rbcS plants had lower A than WT at all temperatures, but had a similar thermal optimum for photosynthesis as WT at both CO2 levels. In WT plants, Rubisco was fully activated at 32°C, but the activation state declined to 64% at 42°C. By contrast, the activation state of Rubisco was above 90% in the S7-1 line, between 15 and 42°C. Both A and J declined about 20% from Topt to the highest measurement temperatures in WT and the S7-1 line, but this was fully reversed after a 20 min recovery at 35°C. At 76 Pa CO2, predicted rates of RuBP regeneration-limited photosynthesis corresponded with measured A in WT tobacco at all temperatures, and in S7-1 tobacco above 40°C. Our observations are consistent with the hypothesis that the high temperature decline in A in the WT is because of an RuBP regeneration limitation, rather than the capacity of Rubisco activase to maintain high Rubisco activation state. © 2008 The Authors.","Activase; Activation state; C3 plants; Electron transport; High temperature; RuBP regeneration; Stomata","carbon dioxide; chlorophyll; rca protein, plant; ribulosebisphosphate carboxylase; unclassified drug; vegetable protein; carbon dioxide; enzyme activity; gas exchange; hypothesis testing; photosynthesis; temperature effect; tobacco; article; electron transport; enzymology; evapotranspiration; genetics; metabolism; mutation; photosynthesis; physiology; plant stoma; temperature; tobacco; Carbon Dioxide; Chlorophyll; Electron Transport; Mutation; Photosynthesis; Plant Proteins; Plant Stomata; Plant Transpiration; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase; Temperature; Tobacco; Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40749097297

Flash evaporation onto glass substrates at different temperatures (from 150 to 750 K) and postannealing at various temperatures were employed to manipulate the structural order in Co2 CrAl HA films. The L 21 -ordered Co2 CrAl HA films exhibit the magnetic, the transport, and the optical properties close to those of the bulk ordered sample. Increase in the structural disorder (L 21 →B2→A2→amorphous state) causes the reduction in the saturation magnetization and the Curie temperature (TC) down to the paramagnetic state for amorphous films. The recrystallization of amorphous Co2 CrAl HA films is accompanied by an increase in resistivity by about 10%, which is interpreted to be related to the energy gap formation at the Fermi level for the minority bands in the L 21 /B2 -ordered state of Co2 CrAl HA. The energy-band structures of L 21 -ordered Co2 CrAl HA have been calculated by using an all-electron full-potential linearized-augmented-plane-wave method. The optical and the magneto-optical properties of L 21 -ordered Co2 CrAl HA have been experimentally investigated and explained in terms of the band structures. It was experimentally shown that the optical properties of crystalline L 21 (or B2) -type ordered alloy at a temperature much higher than TC do not significantly change. Structural disorder in Co2 CrAl HA from the crystalline to the amorphous state also does not radically alter the states responsible for the interband-absorption-peak formation. © 2008 The American Physical Society.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43449096037

According to the earth pollutant terminology, they are next to the nuclear catastrophes. It is because of their concerns over adverse health effects, a number of countries have introduced stringent emission standards. The present review focuses on entire sources of dioxins present in the environment. They are broadly classified into four major categories such as, incineration, combustion, industrial and reservoir sources. State-of-the-art remediation technologies available for reducing dioxins formation and emission from the important sources such as, flue gas, fly ash and soil were described in detail. Further, in order to get a comprehensive perception about the dioxins subject, topics such as, dioxins transfer in the environment, their mode of action, toxicity equivalence factor, exposure and health risk assessment were highlighted in brief in the introduction.

Results suggest a massive temperature reduction of about - 6.4 °C (+ 1.4/- 1.3 °C), combined with annual precipitation rates of about 1100 mm (+ 570 mm/- 280 mm). This implies no major change in annual precipitation compared with today. Summer precipitation was the source for the humidity in the past, as is the case today. This climate scenario argues for a maximum advance of the paleo-glaciers in the eastern cordillera during the global Last Glacial Maximum (LGM, 20 ka BP), which is confirmed by exposure age dates. In a synthesized view over the central Andes, the results point to an increased summer precipitation-driven Late Glacial (15-10 ka BP) maximum advance in the western part of the Altiplano (18°S-23°S), a temperature-driven maximum advance during full glacial times (LGM) in the eastern cordillera, and a pre- and post-LGM (32 ka BP/14 ka BP) maximum advance around 30°S related to increased precipitation and reduced temperature on the western slope of the Andes. The results indicate the importance of understanding the seasonality and details of the mass balance-climate interaction in order to disentangle drivers for the observed regionally asynchronous past glaciations in the central Andes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Regulatory elements thought to assist Mtb to enter such a state include the heme two-component sensor kinases DosS and DosT and the cognate response regulator DosR. We have demonstrated previously that O2, nitric oxide (NO), and carbon monoxide (CO) are regulatory ligands of DosS and DosT. Here, we show that in addition to O2 and NO, CO induces the complete Mtb dormancy (Dos) regulon. Notably, we demonstrate that CO is primarily sensed through DosS to induce the Dos regulon, whereas DosT plays a less prominent role. We also show that Mtb infection of macrophage cells significantly increases the expression, protein levels, and enzymatic activity of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1, the enzyme that produces CO), in an NO-independent manner. Furthermore, exploiting HO-1+/+ and HO-1-/- bone marrow-derived macrophages, we demonstrate that physiologically relevant levels of CO induce the Dos regulon. Finally, we demonstrate that increased HO-1 mRNA and protein levels are produced in the lungs of Mtb-infected mice. Our data suggest that during infection, O2, NO, and CO are being sensed concurrently rather than independently via DosS and DosT. We conclude that CO, a previously unrecognized host factor, is a physiologically relevant Mtb signal capable of inducing the Dos regulon, which introduces a new paradigm for understanding the molecular basis of Mtb persistence. © 2008 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.",,"Enzyme activity; Hemoglobin; Macrophages; Nitric oxide; Plants (botany); Porphyrins; Bone marrows; Enzymatic activities; Heme oxygenase; Human tissues; Macrophage cells; Molecular bases; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Protein levels; Regulatory elements; Response regulators; Sensor kinases; Carbon monoxide; carbon monoxide; heme oxygenase 1; messenger RNA; nitric oxide; oxygen; protein DosR; protein kinase; regulator protein; sensor kinase DosS; sensor kinase DosT; unclassified drug; bacterial protein; carbon monoxide; DevS protein, Mycobacterium tuberculosis; heme oxygenase 1; protamine kinase; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; bone marrow cell; controlled study; dormancy; host cell; macrophage; molecular model; mouse; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; regulatory mechanism; regulon; animal; biological model; C3H mouse; C57BL mouse; chemistry; DNA microarray; gene expression regulation; metabolism; signal transduction; Mus; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Animals; Bacterial Proteins; Carbon Monoxide; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Heme Oxygenase-1; Macrophages; Mice; Mice, Inbred C3H; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Models, Biological; Mycobacterium tuberculosis; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oxygen; Protamine Kinase; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49649095474

Large forest areas in British Columbia (BC), Canada, are infested by the mountain pine beetle (MPB). Dead wood from the infestation is expected to vastly exceed the ability of the pulp and lumber industry to utilize it; current estimates are that 200-600 million m3 of wood will remain unharvested over the next 20 years. Regions where the damaged wood is not harvested will experience loss of jobs in the forestry sector, increased risk of forest fire hazard, carbon emissions from burned or decaying wood, and uncertainty about timing of replanting since this usually occurs at harvest. This paper reports the results of a detailed preliminary techno-economic analysis of producing power from MPB killed wood. Power plant size and location are critical factors affecting overall power cost. Overall cost of power rises steeply at sizes below 300 MW net power output. By locating the power plant in an area of high infestation, transportation distances can be minimized. A 300 MW power plant would consume 64 million m3 of wood over a 20-year lifetime, and hence is a significant sink for otherwise unharvestable wood. Cost estimates are based on harvesting of whole dead trees with roadside chipping and transport to a central power plant located in either the Nazko or Quesnel regions of BC. A circulating fluidized bed boiler with a conventional steam cycle is a currently available technology demonstrated at 240 MW in Finland.

The unpolarized Mn K x rays (EKX =5.97 keV) from the Fe55 radioisotope were used to ionize the Mi subshells and the emitted M x rays were measured under vacuum using a low energy Ge detector. The M x-ray spectra taken at different emission angles were normalized using the isotropically emitted K shell (J= 1 2) x rays measured simultaneously from a V23 thin target placed adjoining the M x-ray target. The present precision measurements infer that anisotropy in the Mαβγ x-ray emission shows trends and order of magnitude predicted by theoretical calculations, i.e., anisotropy parameter (β2) ∼0.01. It clearly rules out strong angular dependence of the M x-ray emission reported earlier. The M x-ray fluorescence integral cross sections have been deduced from the measurements at an emission angle (ψ) =126°, where the second-order Legendre polynomial term, P2 (cos ψ), associated with the angular distribution polynomial is zero.

University, Lubbock, TX, United States","An air quality modeling system was used to simulate the effects on ozone concentration in the northeast USA from climate changes projected through the end of the twenty-first century by the National Center for Atmospheric Research's (NCAR's) parallel climate model, a fully coupled general circulation model, under a higher and a lower scenario of future global changes in concentrations of radiatively active constituents. The air quality calculations were done with both a global chemistry-transport model and a regional air quality model focused on the northeast USA. The air quality simulations assumed no changes in regional anthropogenic emissions of the chemical species primarily involved in the chemical reactions of ozone creation and destruction, but only accounted for changes in the climate. Together, these idealized global and regional model simulations provide insights into the contribution of possible future climate changes on ozone. Over the coming century, summer climate is projected to be warmer and less cloudy for the northeast USA. These changes are considerably larger under the higher scenario as compared with the lower. Higher temperatures also increase biogenic emissions. Both mean daily and 8-h maximum ozone increase from the combination of three factors that tend to favor higher concentrations: (1) higher temperatures change the rates of reactions and photolysis rates important to the ozone chemistry; (2) lower cloudiness (higher solar radiation) increases the photolysis reaction rates; and (3) higher biogenic emissions increase the concentration of reactive species. Regional model simulations with two cumulus parameterizations produce ozone concentration changes that differ by approximately 10%, indicating that there is considerable uncertainty in the magnitude of changes due to uncertainties in how physical processes should be parameterized in the models. However, the overall effect of the climate changes simulated by these models - in the absence of reductions in regional anthropogenic emissions - would be to increase ozone concentrations. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Air quality; Climate change; Northeast USA; Ozone; Regional","air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; biogenic emission; climate change; emission control; ozone; regional climate; sensitivity analysis; twenty first century; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44149126237

The strength of the O VII 0.56 keV line from the Local Hot Bubble, 1.75 ± 0.7 photons cm-2 s-1 sr-1, is consistent with other recent measures. The 0.24 keV component has an emission measure of 0.0021 ± 0.0006 cm-6 pc and is not localized save as diffuse emission within the Galactic plane. Rough calculations show that only about a quarter of this component is due to unresolved stellar emission; it is the best candidate for a pervasive hot medium. The spatial separation of the ∼0.2 keV component from the ∼0.6 keV component suggests that the spectral decompositions of the emission from late-type spiral disks found in the literature do represent real temperature components rather than reflecting more complex temperature distributions. © 2008.

REE and other geochemical data suggest a strong influence of the Irrawaddy River as a major continental source to the ABB sediments. Low carbonate content in the sediments is due to dilution by higher detrital input as well as reduced foraminiferal carbonate contribution because of low sea surface salinity. The contribution from local volcanic sources was identified from the presence of volcanic glass in the sand-sized sediment fraction; higher smectite content in the clay fraction and the trace element data. Mn concentrations in the upper 12 cm are well above those found in pelagic carbonate-free sediments. Mn distribution pattern and oxide nature suggest a hydrothermal source.

During outbreaks, the resulting widespread tree mortality reduces forest carbon uptake and increases future emissions from the decay of killed trees. The impacts of insects on forest carbon dynamics, however, are generally ignored in large-scale modelling analyses. The current outbreak in British Columbia, Canada, is an order of magnitude larger in area and severity than all previous recorded outbreaks. Here we estimate that the cumulative impact of the beetle outbreak in the affected region during 2000-2020 will be 270 megatonnes (Mt) carbon (or 36 g carbon m-2 yr-1 on average over 374,000 km2 of forest). This impact converted the forest from a small net carbon sink to a large net carbon source both during and immediately after the outbreak. In the worst year, the impacts resulting from the beetle outbreak in British Columbia were equivalent to ∼75% of the average annual direct forest fire emissions from all of Canada during 1959-1999. The resulting reduction in net primary production was of similar magnitude to increases observed during the 1980s and 1990s as a result of global change. Climate change has contributed to the unprecedented extent and severity of this outbreak. Insect outbreaks such as this represent an important mechanism by which climate change may undermine the ability of northern forests to take up and store atmospheric carbon, and such impacts should be accounted for in large-scale modelling analyses. ©2008 Nature Publishing Group.",,"carbon; beetle; carbon; climate change; coniferous forest; forest fire; population outbreak; article; Canada; carbon source; climate change; Dendroctonus ponderosae; forest management; global change; harvesting; pine; priority journal; British Columbia; Canada; North America; Coleoptera; Curculionidae; Dendroctonus ponderosae; Hexapoda; Pinus mugo; Scolytinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42549163271

The greenhouse gas balance of Canada's managed forest is strongly affected by naturally occurring fire with high interannual variability in the area burned and by cyclical insect outbreaks. Taking these stochastic future disturbances into account, we used the Carbon Budget Model of the Canadian Forest Sector (CBM-CFS3) to project that the managed forests of Canada could be a source of between 30 and 245 Mt CO 2e yr-1 during the first Kyoto Protocol commitment period (2008-2012). The recent transition from sink to source is the result of large insect outbreaks. The wide range in the predicted greenhouse gas balance (215 Mt CO2e yr-1) is equivalent to nearly 30% of Canada's emissions in 2005. The increasing impact of natural disturbances, the two major insect outbreaks, and the Kyoto Protocol accounting rules all contributed to Canada's decision not to elect forest management. In Canada, future efforts to influence the carbon balance through forest management could be overwhelmed by natural disturbances. Similar circumstances may arise elsewhere if global change increases natural disturbance rates. Future climate mitigation agreements that do not account for and protect against the impacts of natural disturbances, for example, by accounting for forest management benefits relative to baselines, will fail to encourage changes in forest management aimed at mitigating climate change.","Factoring out; Forest management; Greenhouse gases; Kyoto protocol; Mitigation options","arthropod community; article; Canada; carbon cycle; carbon sink; climate change; forest management; greenhouse gas; Monte Carlo method; priority journal; environmental protection; exhaust gas; fire; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; risk; theoretical model; tree; Hexapoda; carbon dioxide; Canada; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Natural Resources; Fires; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Theoretical; Risk; Trees; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40349089634

We first explain why the use of a technology oriented model may add value to the analysis of global GHG strategies. Based on the empirical finding of linear cumulative climate damages, the computation of Nash equilibrium can be reduced to solving a series of 15 independent linear programs, one per region. Moreover, assuming interregional transfers to share the global surplus of cooperation, our work adopts the point of view of dynamic partial equilibrium computation coupled with cooperative game-theoretic principles. The results illustrate how the non-cooperative strategy is closer to the base case than to the cooperative strategy, and the amount of side-payments sufficient to guarantee the stability of the cooperative strategy are calculated with four different rules. The internal (in)stability of farsighted coalitions without transfers (non-cooperation) is also analyzed.

H3A 2K6, Canada","Patterns of coastal erosion in the Arctic differ dramatically from those coasts in more temperate environments. Thick sea ice and shore-fast ice limit wave-based erosional processes to a brief open water season, however despite this, permafrost coasts containing massive ice, ice wedges and ice-bonded sediments tend to experience high rates of erosion. These high rates of erosion reflect the combined thermal-mechanical processes of thawing permafrost, melting ground ice, and wave action. Climate change in the Arctic is expected to result in increased rates of coastal erosion due to warming permafrost, increasing active layer depths and thermokarst, rising sea levels, reduction in sea ice extent and duration, and increasing storm impacts. With the most ice-rich permafrost in the Canadian Arctic, the southern Beaufort Sea coast between the Tuktoyaktuk Peninsula and the Alaskan border is subject to high rates of erosion and retrogressive thaw slump activity. Under many climate change scenarios this area is also predicted to experience the greatest warming in the Canadian Arctic. This paper presents results of a remote sensing study on the long-term patterns of coastal erosion and retrogressive thaw slump activity for Herschel Island in the northern Yukon Territory. Using orthorectified airphotos from 1952 and 1970 and an Ikonos image from 2000 corrected with control points collected by kinematic differential global positioning system and processed using softcopy photogrammetric tools, mean coastal retreat rates of 0.61 m/yr and 0.45 m/yr were calculated for the periods 1952-1970 and 1970-2000, respectively. The highest coastal retreat rates are on north-west facing shorelines which correspond to the main direction of storm-related wave attack. During the period 1970-2000 coastal retreat rates for south to south-east facing shorelines displayed a distinct increase even though these are the most sheltered orientations. However, south to south-east facing shorelines correspond to the orientations where the highest densities of retrogressive thaw slumps are observed. Differences in rates of headwall retreat of retrogressive thaw slumps and coastal erosion results in the formation of larger thermokarst scars and the development of polycyclic thaw slumps on south to south-east exposures. The number and the total area of retrogressive thaw slumps increased by 125% and 160%, respectively, between 1952 and 2000. As well, the proportion of active retrogressive thaw slumps increased dramatically. Polycyclic retrogressive thaw slumps appear to develop in a periodic fashion, related to retrogressive thaw slump stage and maximum inland extent. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We tested the EKC hypothesis with bird populations in 5 different habitats as environmental quality indicators. Because birds are considered environmental goods, for them the EKC hypothesis would instead be associated with a U-shaped relationship between bird populations and GDP per capita. In keeping with the literature, we included other variables in the analysis - namely, human population density and time index variables (the latter variable captured the impact of persistent and exogenous climate and/or policy changes on bird populations over time). Using data from 9 Canadian provinces gathered over 37 years, we used a generalized least-squares regression for each bird habitat type, which accounted for the panel structure of the data, the cross-sectional dependence across provinces in the residuals, heteroskedasticity, and fixed- or random-effect specifications of the models. We found evidence that supports the EKC hypothesis for 3 of the 5 bird population habitat types. In addition, the relationship between human population density and the different bird populations varied, which emphasizes the complex nature of the impact that human populations have on the environment. The relationship between the time-index variable and the different bird populations also varied, which indicates there are other persistent and significant influences on bird populations over time. Overall our EKC results were consistent with those found for threatened bird species, indicating that economic prosperity does indeed act to benefit some bird populations. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.","Bird population trends; Economic growth; Environmental indicators; Environmental Kuznets curve; Human population density","bird; economic growth; environmental degradation; environmental indicator; environmental quality; Gross Domestic Product; habitat type; Kuznets curve; population density; testing method; animal; article; bird; Canada; comparative study; economics; ecosystem; environmental protection; human; human activities; physiology; population density; population dynamics; regression analysis; theoretical model; Animals; Birds; Canada; Conservation of Natural Resources; Economics; Ecosystem; Human Activities; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Population Density; Population Dynamics; Regression Analysis; Canada; North America; Aves",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41849143732

This opposition makes it more difficult to reach the targets of increased shares of use of biofuels in internal combustion engines. One of the reasons for this resistance is a certain lack of knowledge about the effect of biofuels on engine emissions. This paper collects and analyzes the body of work written mainly in scientific journals about diesel engine emissions when using biodiesel fuels as opposed to conventional diesel fuels. Since the basis for comparison is to maintain engine performance, the first section is dedicated to the effect of biodiesel fuel on engine power, fuel consumption and thermal efficiency. The highest consensus lies in an increase in fuel consumption in approximate proportion to the loss of heating value. In the subsequent sections, the engine emissions from biodiesel and diesel fuels are compared, paying special attention to the most concerning emissions: nitric oxides and particulate matter, the latter not only in mass and composition but also in size distributions. In this case the highest consensus was found in the sharp reduction in particulate emissions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The resulting emissions have been compared with those from pure diesel. A stationary engine test bed, together with the instrumentation for measuring the most stringent regulated emissions (nitric oxides, total hydrocarbons and particulate matter) and the particle size distributions, allowed to study the effect of this blend on the engine performance and emissions under five different steady state operating conditions, selected from the transient cycle for light duty vehicles established in the European Emission Directive 70/220. Both the consideration of the thermochemical properties of the tested fuels and the computations of a chemical equilibrium model were helpful for the results analysis. These results proved that the use of this renewable component provides a significant reduction on particulate emissions, with no substantial increase in other gaseous emissions, which makes it helpful for contributing, on the one hand, to fulfil the European compromise of using more than 5.75% biofuels in 2010, and on the other hand, to stop the increase in particulate emissions caused by transportation as a consequence of the unceasing dieselization. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The relationships between composition, orientational order of the carbonates, molar volume and known macroscopic structures, and the possibility of interfacial strain reduction by static disorder in the twin domain, are discussed. We stress the importance of checking for presence of twinned nanodomains using microdiffraction before attributing an apparent superstructure modulation to local cation ordering. High-resolution imaging may not be diagnostic, since overlap of small domains and host matrix can give Moiré patterns that resemble superlattice fringes.","Calcite; Dolomite; Electron diffraction; Superstructures; Twinning","Binary alloys; Calcium alloys; Crystal orientation; Diffraction patterns; Electron diffraction; Interferometry; Magnesium alloys; Metastable phases; Twinning; Dolomite; High-resolution imaging; Interfacial strain; Macroscopic structure; Microdiffractions; Orientational orderings; Superlattice reflections; Superstructures; Calcite; calcite; chemical composition; crystallography; dolomite; microstructure; orientation; twinning",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38649143133

The use of activated carbon, a technique for neutralizing allelopathic compounds, is now employed in tests for allelopathy; however, this technique also could produce large experimental artifacts. • In three independent experiments, it was shown that adding activated carbon to potting media affected nutrient availability and plant growth. For most species tested, activated carbon increased plant biomass, even in the absence of the potentially allelopathic agent. • The increased growth corresponded to increased plant nitrogen content, likely resulting from greater nitrogen availability. Activated carbon also affected nitrogen and other nutrient concentrations in soil media in the absence of plants. • The observed effects of activated carbon on plant growth can confound its use to test for allelopathy. The detection of allelopathy relies on the difference between plant growth in medium with carbon and that in medium without carbon in the presence of the potentially allelopathic competitor; however, this difference may be biased if activated carbon alters soil nutrient availability and plant growth even in the absence of the focal allelopathic agent. © The Authors (2008).","Activated charcoal; Allelopathy; Biological invasion; Centaurea solstitialis; Centaurea stoebe micranthos; Lepidium draba","carbon; activated carbon; allelopathy; biological invasion; charcoal; dicotyledon; experimental study; growth rate; nutrient availability; soil nitrogen; article; bioavailability; drug effect; growth, development and aging; metabolism; plant; soil; Biological Availability; Carbon; Plants; Soil; Centaurea; Centaurea solstitialis; Centaurea stoebe; Lepidium; Lepidium draba",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41149173085

Many impacts of these environmental variables on plant damage are likely indirect and result because both resource availability and diversity can influence plant traits associated with attractiveness to herbivores or susceptibility to pathogens. We used a long-term, manipulative field experiment to investigate how carbon dioxide (CO2) enrichment, nitrogen (N) fertilization, and plant community diversity affect plant traits and the amount of herbivore and pathogen damage experienced by the common prairie legume Lespedeza capitata. We detected little evidence that CO2 or N affected plant traits; however, plants growing in highdiversity treatments (polycultures) were taller, were less pubescent, and produced thinner leaves (higher specific leaf area). Interestingly, we also detected little evidence that CO2 or N affect damage. Plants growing in polycultures compared to monocultures, however, experienced a fivefold increase in damage from generalist herbivores, 64% less damage from specialist herbivores, and 91% less damage from pathogens. Moreover, within diversity treatments, damage by generalist herbivores was negatively correlated with pubescence and often was positively correlated with plant height, while damage by specialist herbivores typically was positively correlated with pubescence and negatively associated with height. These patterns are consistent with changes in plant traits driving differences in herbivory between diversity treatments. In contrast, changes in measured plant traits did not explain the difference in disease incidence between monocultures and polycultures. In summary, our data provide little evidence that CO2 or N supply alter damage from natural enemies. By contrast, plants grown in monocultures experienced greater specialist herbivore and pathogen damage but less generalist herbivore damage than plants grown in diverse communities. Part of this diversity effect was mediated by changes in plant traits, many of which likely are plastic responses to diversity treatments, but some of which may be the result of evolutionary changes in response to these long-term experimental manipulations. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Carbon dioxide; Disease; Diversity; Herbivory; Lespedeza capitata; Nitrogen deposition; Plant-herbivore; Plant-pathogen; Resource availability","carbon dioxide; nitrogen; carbon dioxide; damage; environmental factor; herbivory; legume; nitrogen; plant community; resource availability; species diversity; article; biodiversity; drug effect; ecosystem; feeding behavior; growth, development and aging; host parasite interaction; host pathogen interaction; Lespedeza; physiology; plant leaf; population density; Biodiversity; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Feeding Behavior; Host-Parasite Interactions; Host-Pathogen Interactions; Lespedeza; Nitrogen; Plant Leaves; Population Density; Lespedeza; Lespedeza capitata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40449120486

In recent years, thanks to improved satellite and in situ observations, and better models, great strides have been made in aerosol and monsoon research, respectively. There is now a growing body of evidence suggesting that interaction of aerosol forcing with monsoon dynamics may alter the redistribution of energy in the atmosphere and at the Earth's surface, thereby influencing monsoon water cycle and climate. In this article, the authors describe the scientific rationale and challenges for an integrated approach to study the interactions between aerosol and monsoon water cycle dynamics.

Damage from intense winds may be especially severe in fragmented forests because of their abrupt artificial margins and denuded surrounding landscapes. We review available information on the effects of windstorms on fragmented forests, synthesizing studies from Australasia, Amazonia and elsewhere in the tropics. Wind damage in fragmented landscapes can be influenced by a range of factors, such as forest-edge orientation, edge structure, the size of nearby clearings and local topography. We argue that wind disturbances are likely to interact with, and exacerbate, a range of deleterious environmental changes in fragmented forests. Among the most important of these are altered forest structure, shifts in plant species composition, exotic-plant invasions, reduced carbon storage and elevated vulnerability to fire. The damaging impacts of winds on fragmented forests could potentially increase in the future, particularly if global warming leads to increasingly severe or frequent windstorms.","Edge effect; Forest dynamics; Habitat fragmentation; Plant functional trait; Windstorm resistance and resilience","carbon sequestration; community composition; edge effect; environmental disturbance; forest dynamics; global warming; habitat fragmentation; invasive species; literature review; storm damage; vulnerability; wind; Amazonia; Australasia; South America",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43449129463

This omission has consequences for ground thermal and moisture regimes, particularly in the high-latitudes where soil carbon content is generally high. Global soil carbon data is used to build a geographically distributed, profiled soil carbon density dataset for the Community Land Model (CLM). CLM parameterizations for soil thermal and hydraulic properties are modified to accommodate both mineral and organic soil matter. Offline simulations including organic soil are characterized by cooler annual mean soil temperatures (up to ∼2.5°C cooler for regions of high soil carbon content). Cooling is strong in summer due to modulation of early and mid-summer soil heat flux. Winter temperatures are slightly warmer as organic soils do not cool as efficiently during fall and winter. High porosity and hydraulic conductivity of organic soil leads to a wetter soil column but with comparatively low surface layer saturation levels and correspondingly low soil evaporation. When CLM is coupled to the Community Atmosphere Model, the reduced latent heat flux drives deeper boundary layers, associated reductions in low cloud fraction, and warmer summer air temperatures in the Arctic. Lastly, the insulative properties of organic soil reduce interannual soil temperature variability, but only marginally. This result suggests that, although the mean soil temperature cooling will delay the simulated date at which frozen soil begins to thaw, organic matter may provide only limited insulation from surface warming. © Springer-Verlag 2007.","Climate modeling; Land-surface scheme; Permafrost; Soil carbon; Soil temperature","boundary layer; climate modeling; cooling; global climate; hydraulic conductivity; latent heat flux; moisture content; organic soil; parameterization; permafrost; porosity; soil carbon; soil temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849152178

In agreement with the macrofossil assemblage, most of the biomarkers were related to terrigenous organic matter, as evidenced by the presence of di- and triterpenoid derivatives from vascular plants. The aromatic hydrocarbon fraction was also shown to contain two predominant series of unknown C40 oxygenated compounds, as indicated by high resolution mass spectrometry. Isolation of the predominant compound from the first series and of two isomers from the second was undertaken to determine the structures from nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies. Thus, we determined that both series of compounds consist of bis-diterpenoids made up of phenolic sub-units related to totarol and sempervirol, possibly originating from Podocarpaceae. Their formation comprises a first step involving oxidative coupling between the two phenolic monomeric sub-units via a free radical mechanism and leading to the formation of an ether bond (first series of compounds), or a carbon-carbon bond (second series of compounds). In the case of the compounds from the second series, a second, acid-catalysed cyclisation step likely results in the formation of a central dibenzofuranyl moiety.

Particulate was collected during two sampling periods, from the late summer to the early fall and from the middle to late fall, at the IC site and one sampling period, from the middle fall to the early winter, at the residential site. PM2.5 and TSP samples were taken by an annular denuder system and a hi-volume air sampler, respectively. The authors also identified the concentrations and components of heavy metals extracted from the PM2.5 and TSP filters, the acidic components extracted from the PM2.5 filters, and the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) extracted from polyurethane foam (PUF) plug. The average concentrations of the PM2.5 collected at the IC and residential sites were very similar. Major sources of PM2.5 at the study sites, however, were air emissions from vehicles and industry as well as emissions from residential heating and soil origins, respectively. The higher concentrations of the TSP at the IC site, as compared to those at the residential site, were due to either increased suspended dust from vehicle emissions or re-suspended road dust because of increased vehicle speeds near the IC site. Heavy metal concentrations in the TSPs were higher than those in the PM2.5. The heavy metal concentrations in the PM2.5 and TSP at the IC site with heavy traffic were substantially greater than those at the residential site. The concentrations of TSP and heavy metals and PAHs in PM during the period of the middle to late fall was much higher than those during the period of the late summer to early fall at the IC site. This is because of the difference in meteorological characteristics and energy uses between two periods. The residential site also showed higher concentrations of acidic anions while the IC site showed higher concentrations of acidic cation. Secondary aerosols or particulates, such as ammonium nitrate or ammonium nitrite, might have been important constituents of the PM2.5 at the residential site. The PAHs in the TSP collected at the IC site was greatly affected by traffic and industry emissions consisting mostly of high molecular weight PAHs with two to four rings. PAHs in the TSP at the site, however, were affected by residential heating and air emissions from small chemical plants having higher concentrations of low molecular weight PAHs with five to six rings. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Acidic components; Annular denuder; Correlation; Heavy metal; PAHs; PM2.5; TSP","Acidic components; Annular denuder; Total suspended particulate; Dust; Heavy metals; Molecular weight; Particles (particulate matter); Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Polyurethanes; Atmospheric aerosols; acid; ammonium nitrate; ammonium nitrite; heavy metal; nitrite; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivative; polyurethan foam; unclassified drug; acidity; aerosol; heavy metal; industrial emission; PAH; suspended particulate matter; traffic emission; aerosol; air analysis; air monitoring; air pollution; air sampler; concentration (parameters); conference paper; exhaust gas; geographic distribution; industrial area; Korea; molecular weight; particulate matter; residential home; seasonal variation; suspended particulate matter; Acids; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Korea; Metals, Heavy; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Seasons; Urban Population; Vehicle Emissions; Weather",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36549019102

Three interior dwarf mangrove habitats (Twin Cays, Belize) where surface soils were overlain by microbial mats were sampled during wet and dry periods of the year. Porewater equilibration meters and standard biogeochemical methods provided steady-state porewater profiles of pH, chloride, sulfate, sulfide, ammonium, nitrate/nitrite, phosphate, dissolved organic carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus, reduced iron and manganese, dissolved inorganic carbon, methane and nitrous oxide. During the wet season, the salinity of overlying pond water and shallow porewaters decreased. Increased rainwater infiltration through soils combined with higher tidal heights appeared to result in increased organic carbon inventories and more reducing soil porewaters. During the dry season, evaporation increased both surface water and porewater salinities, while lower tidal heights resulted in less reduced soil porewaters. Rainfall strongly influenced inventories of dissolved organic carbon and nitrogen, possibly due to more rapid decay of mangrove litter during the wet season. During both times of year, high concentrations of reduced metabolites accumulated at depth, indicating substantial rates of organic matter mineralization coupled primarily to sulfate reduction. Nitrous oxide and methane concentrations were supersaturated indicating considerable rates of nitrification and/or incomplete denitrification and methanogenesis, respectively. More reducing soil conditions during the wet season promoted the production of reduced manganese. Contemporaneous activity of sulfate reduction and methanogenesis was likely fueled by the presence of noncompetitive substrates. The findings indicate that these interior dwarf areas are unique sites of nutrient and energy regeneration and may be critical to the overall persistence and productivity of mangrove-dominated islands in oligotrophic settings. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Dwarf mangrove; Methanogenesis; Nutrients; Porewater; Redox metabolites; Sulfate reduction","dissolved organic carbon; infiltration; mangrove; metabolism; methanogenesis; microbial mat; oligotrophic environment; porewater; reduction; seasonal variation; soil microorganism; soil water; sulfate; water chemistry; Belize [Central America]; Central America; Stann Creek; Twin Cays; Rhizophora mangle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42049092158

These sediments have high organic contents at depths greater than 2,000 m; this is rare for deep-sea sediments, except for those of the Black Sea and Chilean upwelling regions. The mean organic carbon to total nitrogen molar ratio was estimated to be 6.98 in the Ulleung Basin sediments, indicating that the organic matter is predominantly of marine origin. Strong organic carbon enrichment in the Ulleung Basin appears to result from high export production, and low dilution by inputs of terrestrial materials and calcium carbonate. Apparent sedimentation rates, calculated primarily from excess 210Pb distribution below the zone of sediment mixing, varied from 0.033 to 0.116 cm year-1, agreeing well with previous results for the basin. OCARs fluctuated strongly in the range of 2.06-12.5 g C m-2 year-1, these rates being four times higher at the slope sites than at the basin sites. Within the top 15 cm of the sediment, the integrated SRRs ranged from 0.72 to 1.89 mmol m-2 day-1, with rates approximately twice as high in the slope areas as in the basin areas. SRR values were consistently higher in areas of high sedimentation and of high organic carbon accumulation, correlating well with apparent sedimentation rates and OCARs. The sulfate reduction rates recorded in the basin and slope sediments of the Ulleung Basin are higher than those reported for other parts of the world, with the exception of the Peruvian and Chilean upwelling regions. This is consistent with the high organic carbon contents of surface sediments of the Ulleung Basin, suggesting enhanced organic matter fluxes. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,"Organic carbon; Sea level; Sulfur compounds; Transport properties; Organic carbon accumulation; Sulfate reduction; Upwelling; Sediments; accumulation rate; calcium carbonate; deep-sea sediment; nitrogen; organic carbon; organic matter; reduction; sediment chemistry; sedimentation rate; sulfate; upwelling; Pacific Ocean; Sea of Japan; Ulleung Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42549107578

Knowledge on fine particles has increased substantially during the last 10 years, and even the current, lowered levels in the Europe and in the United States appear to be a major public health problem. On the other hand, dioxins are ubiquitous persistent contaminants, some being carcinogens at high doses, and therefore of great concern. Our aim was to (a) quantitatively analyze the two pollutant health risks and (b) study the changes in risk in view of the current and forthcoming EU legislations on pollutants. We performed a comparative risk assessment for both pollutants in the Helsinki metropolitan area (Finland) and estimated the health effects with several scenarios. For primary fine particles: a comparison between the present emission situation for heavy-duty vehicles and the new fine particle emission standards set by the EU. For dioxins: an EU directive that regulates commercial fishing of Baltic salmon and herring that exceed the dioxin concentration limit set for fish meat, and a derogation (= exemption) from the directive for these two species. Both of these two decisions are very topical issues and this study estimates the expected changes in health effects due to these regulations. It was found that the estimated fine particle risk clearly outweighed the estimated dioxin risk. A substantial improvement to public health could be achieved by initiating reductions in emission standards; about 30 avoided premature deaths annually in the study area. In addition, the benefits of fish consumption due to omega-3 exposure were notably higher than the potential dioxin cancer risk. Both regulations were instigated as ways of promoting public health. © 2008 Society for Risk Analysis.","Dioxin; European Union legislation; Fine particles; Fish; Risk assessment; Risk comparison","Health risks; Impurities; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Ubiquitous computing; Dioxin; Fine particles; Risk comparison; Hydrocarbons; dioxin; cancer; carcinogen; comparative study; dioxin; emission control; estimation method; fish; food consumption; health risk; metropolitan area; public health; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; article; controlled study; exhaust gas; fish; fish meat; food intake; health hazard; human; particle size; pollutant; risk assessment; Animals; Diet; Dioxins; Finland; Fishes; Humans; Meat; Motor Vehicles; Risk Assessment; Urban Population; Vehicle Emissions; Etela Suomen; Eurasia; Europe; Finland; Helsinki; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Clupeidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39849102971

Labels and standards can play an important role in transforming our material economy to address these problems. Current trends in standard setting, however, threaten to confuse consumers and may actually stifle innovation. The problems of climate change and persistent bioaccumulative toxicants (PBTs) and the host of other resource depletion, toxicity and social justice issues presented by current building material practice are urgent but complex. A rethinking of our approach to standards and labeling from a goal-oriented, strategic perspective can help resolve tradeoffs and energize markets to deliver better goods that strive toward sustainability ideals. Effective standards and labels must be: clear about their ultimate goals, comprehensive In scope, able to deal with uncertainty and data gaps, transparent and designed to reward continuous improvement. The U.S. Green Building Council (USGBC) has initiated a process that demonstrates components of this strategic approach in addressing climate change. HBN's Pharos Project is seeking to provide a framework to help map out and facilitate that strategic approach by establishing ideals in each category of impact and a roadmap to score progress toward that goal.

The model is based on an open system representing the surface of the metallic matrix and the electrolyte. The galvanic action at microscopic scale is described by a system of equations that meets thermal diffusion and chemical co diffusion effects with entropy production due to both heat and diffusion fluxes. The application of the model requires an experimental validation on which adequate values for the phenomenological coefficients were found. The heterogeneous nature of the grains arrangement on the carbon steel surface corresponds to a heterogeneous mechanism of galvanic action so that the resulting engineering parameters are mean values of the magnitude on the extensive properties of the system.","Carbon steel; Electronic affinity; Galvanic action; Irreversible processes; Local cell corrosion",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960304012

Thermodynamic functions (i.e., heat capacity, formation enthalpies, entropies, and Gibbs free energies) have been measured from near absolute zero to 1100 K using calorimetric methods, including drop solution, low-temperature adiabatic relaxation, and differential scanning calorimetry. In addition, the thermodynamic characteristics of the magnetic-phase transition from the antiferromagnetic to the paramagnetic state are reported. It has been shown that CCTO is very stable relative to constituent oxides and calcium titanate at room temperature and higher, independent of the synthesis route. The enthalpic factor is dominant in the thermodynamics of CCTO, with the entropic factor having almost no effect on the stability of the compound relative to other oxide assemblages. The recommended values for the standard molar enthalpy of formation from constituent oxides and from elements at 298.15 K are -122.1 ± 4.5 and -4155.7 ± 5.2 kJ/mol-1, respectively. The mean of the third law entropy at 298.15 K is 368.4 ±0.1 J/mol-1/K-1.

Therefore, atmospheric concentration observations over populated regions would provide the ultimate proof if sustained emissions changes have occurred. The most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide (CO2), also shows large natural concentration variations, which need to be disentangled from anthropogenic signals to assess changes in associated emissions. This is in principle possible for the fossil fuel CO2 component (FFCO 2) by high-precision radiocarbon (14C) analyses because FFCO2 is free of radiocarbon. Long-term observations of 14CO2 conducted at two sites in south-western Germany do not yet reveal any significant trends in the regional fossil fuel CO2 component. We rather observe strong inter-annual variations, which are largely imprinted by changes of atmospheric transport as supported by dedicated transport model simulations of fossil fuel CO2. In this paper, we show that, depending on the remoteness of the site, changes of about 7-26% in fossil fuel emissions in respective catchment areas could be detected with confidence by high-precision atmospheric 14CO2 measurements when comparing 5-year averages if these inter-annual variations were taken into account.

The interchangeability of these locally derived empirical-statistical models was examined by predicting BTS values from the equations developed at the other two sites, and using logistic regression to relate these modelled values to the local ground-truthed data. Equations for two of the areas were effectively interchangeable, producing permafrost extent predictions within 2% of each other, and permafrost probabilities within ±0.1 for more than 85 % of the cells. Predictions were much less similar when their equations were applied to the third area and when its equation was applied to them. Model interchangeability appears to depend on where a site lies on a continuum from elevation controlled (infinite ratio of the standardised coefficient of elevation to that of potential incoming solar radiation in the BTS equation), to radiation dominated (ratio much less than unity of the same variables). Extensive ground-truthing is essential, helping to constrain the logistic regression and hence the overall permafrost percentage. Additional investigations are needed to relate these ratios to regional climate in order to allow the spatial interpolation of permafrost probability models across the North American Cordillera.

Estimating the changes in carbon stocks due to tropical deforestation has been difficult, mainly because of uncertainties in estimating deforestation rates and the biomass in the forest that have been cut. In this study, we combined detailed land-use change over a 27-year period based on satellite images and forest inventory data to estimate changes in biomass carbon stocks in the Xishuangbanna prefecture (1.9 million ha) of China. Xishuangbanna is located in southwestern China in the upper watershed of the Mekong River, and the major forest types are tropical seasonal rain forest, mountain rain forest, and subtropical evergreen broadleaf forest. In the past when the region was completely forested the total biomass carbon would have been approximately 212.65 ± 8.75 Tg C. By 1976 forest cover had been reduced to 70%, and in addition many forests had been degraded resulting in a large decrease in the total biomass carbon stocks (86.97 ± 3.70 Tg C). From 1976 to 2003, the mean deforestation rate was 13 722 ha year-1 (1.12%), and this resulted in the loss of 370,494 ha of forest, and by 2003 total biomass carbon stocks had been reduced to 80.85 ± 2.64 Tg C. The annual carbon emissions due to land-use change, mainly forest conversion to agriculture and rubber plantations, were 0.37 ± 0.03 Tg C year-1 between 1976 and 1988 and 0.13 ± 0.04 Tg C year-1 between 1988 and 2003. During the next 20 years, if rubber plantations expand into forests outside of reserves, shrublands, grasslands, and shifting cultivation below 1500 m the total biomass carbon stocks of Xishuangbanna will decrease to 76.45 ± 1.49 Tg C in 2023. This would reflect a loss of 4.13 ± 1.14 Tg C between 2003 and 2023, or an annual loss of 0.21 ± 0.06 Tg C year-1. Alternatively, if rubber plantations only expand into areas of shifting cultivation below 1500 m, and all areas presently in shrublands and grasslands are allowed to recover into secondary forests, total biomass carbon stock of the region would increase to 92.65 ± 3.80 Tg C in 2023. Under this scenario, the growth of existing forests and the expansion of new forests would result in a net sequestration of 0.60 ± 0.06 Tg C year-1. This study demonstrates that the uncertainty of biomass estimates can be greatly reduced if detailed land-use analyses are combined with forest inventory data, and that slight changes in future land-use practices can have large implications for carbon fluxes. © 2007.","Carbon stocks; Forest biomass; Future scenarios; Land use/land cover change; Rubber plantations; Tropical region; Xishuangbanna","Biomass; Carbon; Deforestation; Satellite imagery; Carbon dynamics; Land cover change; Tropical region; Land use; biomass; broad-leaved forest; carbon emission; deforestation; global change; land use; plantation; rubber; satellite imagery; Biomass; Carbon; Deforestation; Land Use; Satellites; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Mekong River; Xishuangbanna; Yunnan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38749099749

An overview of existing literature regarding long-term energy-demand and carbon dioxide (CO2) emission forecast scenarios is presented. Energy consumption in buildings could be reduced by 100-300 million tons of oil equivalent (mtoe) in 2030 compared with the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, which means that 600-700 million metric tons of CO2 emissions could be saved by implementing appropriate energy policies within an adapted institutional framework. The main energy-saving potentials in buildings can be achieved by improving a building's thermal performance and district heating system efficiency. The analyses also reveal that the energy interchange systems are effective especially in the early stage of penetration. Our analysis on the reviewed models suggests that more ambitious efficiency improvement policies in both supply- and demand-side as well as the carbon price should be taken into account in the policy scenarios to address drastic reduction of CO2 emission in the building sector to ensure climate security over the next decades. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Neutral solutions produce rod-like ZnO nanostructures that grow laterally during subsequent thermal annealing. Acid solutions result in a combination of regions consisting of either rods or platelets. Using spatially resolved cathodoluminescence spectroscopy, it is observed that thermal treatment of ZnO grown in neutral sol affects the deep-level luminescence, reducing the yellow emission but retaining the green luminescence. In material grown from acid solutions, stronger luminescence has been observed from rods compared to platelets. Luminescence from nanorods shows donor-bound exciton and donor-acceptor-pair emissions at low temperatures (&lt;40 K) and a broad near-band-edge peak for higher temperatures.

It was found that the ignition temperature of POM reaction increased with the decreasing of the Rh loadings in the catalysts. For the POM reaction over the catalysts with high (≥1 wt%) Rh loadings, steady-state reactivity was observed. For the reaction over the catalysts with low (≤0.25 wt%) Rh loadings, however, oscillations in CH4 and reaction products (CO, H2, and CO2) were observed. Comparative studies using H2-TPR, O2-TPD and high temperature in situ Raman spectroscopy techniques were carried out in order to elucidate the relation between the redox property of the Rh species in the Rh/Al2O3 with different Rh loadings and the performance of the catalysts for the reaction. Three kinds of oxidized rhodium species, i.e. the rhodium oxide species insignificantly affected by the support (RhOx), that intimately interacting with the Al2O3 surface (RhiOx) and the Rh(AlO2)y species formed by diffusion of rhodium oxides in to sublayers of Al2O3 [C.P. Hwang, C.T. Yeh, Q.M. Zhu, Catal. Today, 51 (1999) 93.], were identified by H2-TPR and O2-TPD experiments. Among them, the first two species can be easily reduced by H2 at temperature below 350 °C, while the last one can only be reduced by H2 at temperature above 500 °C. The ignition temperatures of POM reaction over the catalysts are closely related to the temperature at which most of the RhOx and RhiOx species can be reduced by CH4 in the reaction mixture. Compared to the Rh/Al2O3 with high Rh loadings, the catalysts with low Rh loadings contain more RhiOx species which possess stronger Rh{single bond}O bond strength and are more difficult to be reduced than RhOx by the reaction mixture. Higher temperature is therefore required to ignite the POM reaction over the catalysts with lower Rh loadings. The oscillation during the POM reaction over the Rh/Al2O3 with low Rh loadings can be related to the behaviour of Rh(AlO2)y species in the catalyst switching cyclically from the oxidized state to the reduced state during the reaction. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The catalysts were characterized by means of XRD and H2-TPR. The reactions between methane and lattice oxygen from the complex oxides were investigated. The characteristic results revealed that the combination of Ce and Fe oxide in the catalysts could lower the temperature necessary to reduce the cerium oxide. The catalytic activity for selective CH4 oxidation was strongly influenced by dropped Fe species. Adding the appropriate amount of Fe2O3 to CeO2 could promote the action between CH4 and CeO2. Dispersed Fe2O3 first returned to the original state and would then virtually form the Fe species on the catalyst, which could be considered as the active site for selective CH4 oxidation. The appearance of carbon formation was significant and the oxidation of carbon appeared to be the rate-determining step; the amounts of surface reducible oxygen species in CeO2 were also relevant to the activity.

However, the transgression and the anthropogenic environment deterioration have ever been employed to explain the abandonment of the site. Based on a dynasty framework established by the 14C dating, and using the experimental methods such as micro-paleontology identification in foraminifera and charophytes, the content test of Rb and Sr, susceptibility analysis as well as granularity and sedimentary facies analysis, some researches on the sediments from the two exploration layers at Tenghualuo Site were conducted, and the following new findings have been gained: Firstly, foraminifera which are relevant to the marine environment were not found in the sediment layer, however, 25 charales, which usually live in the freshwater environment, in 07LTT1 exploration samples were found. Among them, 3 charales were found in the samples from the forth sediment layer below the late Longshan Cultural Layer and 22 charates were from the second sediment layer above the late Longshan Cultural layer. Furthermore, 5 plant seeds and 41 fungal spores, together with many carbonation holes, plant seed shells, as well as their roots and stems were also found in the second sediment layer above the late Longshan Cultural layer. Secondly, the cumulative probability curves of the sediments' granularity in both the last and its overlying culture intermittent layers have characteristics of three-phase river sediment curve, and the ratios between Rb and Sr are both quite high in samples from two layers sedimented during the disappearing time of the site. All above-mentioned evidences indicate that disappearance of the Tenghualuo Site was not related to the transgression. The late Longshan Culture of the site could be completely abandoned after a relatively long-term inland water flood. © 2008 Science in China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.","Charophytes; Disappearing reasons; Foraminifera; Granularity sedimentary facies; Rb and Sr ratio; Tenghualuo Site","Characeae; Charales; Foraminifera; Fungi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44449098229

Current model of carbon cycle evolution usually assumes that carbonic acid is the major weathering agent and that other acids are not important. Here, we use carbon isotopic evidence and water chemistry of springs and rivers from the Beipanjiang River basin (Guizhou Province, Southwest China) to demonstrate that sulfuric acid is also an important agent of rock weathering. The δ13C of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the water samples ranges from - 13.1‰ to - 2.4‰, and correlates negatively to [HCO3-]/([Ca2+] + [Mg2+]) ratios and positively to [SO42-]/([Ca2+] + [Mg2+]) ratios. These relationships are interpreted as mixing diagrams between two reactions of carbonate weathering, using carbonic acid and sulfuric acid as a proton donor, respectively. Mixing proportions show that around 42% of the divalent cations in the spring water from Guizhou are originated from the interaction between carbonate minerals and sulfuric acid. It is shown that 40% of this sulfuric acid is derived from the atmosphere and has an anthropogenic origin. The remaining 60% are derived from the oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals in sedimentary rocks. Our results show the positive action of sulfuric acid on the chemical weathering of carbonate. Particularly, we show that sulfuric acid generated by coal combustion has increased by almost 20% the weathering rates of carbonate in Southwest China. This is a clear evidence that human activities are changing the weathering rates of rocks and demonstrates a negative feedback on the acidification of the ocean by greenhouse gases. Because of the involvement of sulfuric acid in weathering reactions, 63% of the alkalinity exported by rivers is derived from carbonate, instead of 50% when atmospheric CO2 is the only acid involved in chemical weathering of carbonate. In the Guizhou Province, the weathering of carbonate is thus, at least transiently, a net source of CO2 to the atmosphere. When extrapolated at global scale, sulfuric acid-induced carbonate weathering could counterbalance a significant part of the CO2 consumed by silicate weathering. This paper highlights the competition between silicate weathering by carbonic acid and carbonate weathering by sulfuric acid for the regulation of the atmospheric CO2 level. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Therefore, differential detection of specific proteins might play an important role in diagnosis and treatment of this type of brain injury. Objective: To compare differential cerebral cortical protein expression of craniocerebral injury patients and normal subjects through the use of proteomics. Design: Contrast observation. Setting: Department of Neurosurgery, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University. Participants: Ten patients (6 males and 4 females, 20-58 years old), with severe craniocerebral injury, were selected at the Department of Neurosurgery, Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, from June 2004 to December 2006. All patients were diagnosed with CT test and Glasgow test (scores < 8). Surgery was performed 4-12 hours after craniocerebral injury, and injured cortical tissues of the frontal and temporal lobes were resected for sampling. At the same time, control cortical tissues were collected from frontal and temporal lobes of 2 epileptic patients who underwent hippocampus-nucleus amygdala resection, and 2 lateral ventricular tumor patients who underwent tumor resection. The participants and their relatives provided confirmed consent, and this study received confirmed consent from the local ethics committee. Methods: Ten samples from injured patients and 4 normal samples were compared through the use of proteomics. Total protein was separated by using two-dimensional electrophoresis with immobilized pH gradients, and the differential protein expressions were compared using image analysis after blue-sliver staining. Differential protein spot expressions were analyzed with a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI/TOF MS) and electrospray ionization-quadrupole time of flight mass spectrometry (ESI-Qq TOF MS). Main outcome measures: 1 Two-dimensional electrophoresis of protein from cerebral cortex; 2 differential protein expression. Results: 1 Two-dimensional electrophoresis of protein from cerebral cortex: two-dimensional gel electrophoretogram, which is considered to have high resolution and consistent duplication, was performed on injured cortical tissues and normal cortical tissues. The image analysis system detected 21 differential protein spots. 2 Differential protein spot expressions: mass spectrometry resulted in 17 differential protein spots that related to metabolic response, oxidative stress response, and signal transduction. Conclusion: MALDI/TOF MS and ESI-Qq TOF MS are exceptional methods for evaluating differential protein expression.

Molecular evaluation of cells from metabolically affected brain regions could provide new information about the pathogenesis of AD and new targets at which to aim disease-slowing and prevention therapies. Data from a genome-wide transcriptomic study were used to compare the expression of 80 metabolically relevant nuclear genes from laser-capture microdissected non-tangle-bearing neurons from autopsy brains of AD cases and normal controls in posterior cingulate cortex, which is metabolically affected in the earliest stages; other brain regions metabolically affected in PET studies of AD or normal aging; and visual cortex, which is relatively spared. Compared with controls, AD cases had significantly lower expression of 70% of the nuclear genes encoding subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport chain in posterior cingulate cortex, 65% of those in the middle temporal gyrus, 61% of those in hippocampal CA1, 23% of those in entorhinal cortex, 16% of those in visual cortex, and 5% of those in the superior frontal gyrus. Western blots confirmed underexpression of those complex I-V subunits assessed at the protein level. Cerebral metabolic rate for glucose abnormalities in FDG PET studies of AD may be associated with reduced neuronal expression of nuclear genes encoding subunits of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. © 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.","Affymetrix microarrays; Gene expression; Laser capture micro-dissection","fluorodeoxyglucose; glucose; aged; aging; Alzheimer disease; article; autopsy; brain metabolism; cingulate gyrus; electron transport; energy metabolism; entorhinal cortex; female; frontal cortex; gene expression; genetic association; hippocampus; human; human cell; human tissue; laser capture microdissection; male; mitochondrial respiration; nerve cell; positron emission tomography; priority journal; protein expression; pyramidal nerve cell; respiratory chain; temporal cortex; visual cortex; Western blotting; Alzheimer disease; brain; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; nerve cell; Aged; Alzheimer Disease; Brain; Energy Metabolism; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Male; Neurons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41949086089

In this regard, ingestion of small amounts of condensed quebracho tannin has been found to reduce N concentration in livestock urine. In this study, we sought to quantify the effects of tannin-affected cattle urine, normal cattle urine, and NH4NO3 in solution on greenhouse gas flux. Carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) flux was measured using static chamber methodology from the three N treatments and a no application control over a 6-week period in a mixed grass prairie in west-central North Dakota, USA. Over the course of the study, average CO2 emission was greatest from normal urine (335 ± 8 mg C m-2 h-1) and least from the control (229 ± 19 mg C m-2 h-1), with intermediate fluxes for the tannin urine and NH4NO3 treatments (290 ± 27 and 286 ± 54 mg C m-2 h-1, respectively). Methane uptake was prevalent throughout the study, as soil conditions were predominantly warm and dry. Uptake of CH4 was greatest within the control (-30 ± 2 μg C m-2 h-1) and least in the tannin urine treatment (-12 ± 4 μg C m-2 h-1). Uptake of CH4 was over 40% less within the tannin urine treatment as compared to normal urine, and may have been repressed by the capacity of tannin to bind monooxygenases responsible for CH4 oxidation. Average N2O emission from NH4NO3 solution was more than twice that of all other treatments. Though the tannin urine treatment possessed 34% less N than normal cattle urine, cumulative N2O emission between the treatments did not differ. Results from this study suggest the use of condensed quebracho tannin as a dietary amendment for livestock does not yield GHG mitigation benefits in the short-term.","Greenhouse gas emission; Tannin; Urine patches","carbon dioxide; cattle; diet; emission; grass; greenhouse gas; livestock; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; prairie; tannin; urine; Great Plains; North America; North Dakota; United States; Bos; Schinopsis balansae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40849096093

""From 1990 to 2003, Canada's energy efficiency improved by an estimated 13%, or 883.3 petajoules, saving Canadians almost $13.4 billion in 2003 alone and reducing annual greenhouse gas emissions by 52.3 megatonnes"". In 2000, about 17% of Canadian primary energy supply came from renewable sources (with hydroelectric, combustible renewables and waste). Canada is a leader in devising and implementing energy options for sustainable development. However, the nation still has great scope for furthering energy efficiency and more use of renewable energy. Canada has a higher aggregate intensity-absolute energy use per capita or per unit of GDP-than most International Energy Agency (IEA) countries, ranking second and fourth, respectively. In 2000, Canada used only a small amount of renewable energy (without hydroelectric, combustible renewables and waste), accounting for 1.3% of its primary energy supply. Canada has made little use of wind power compared to other industrialized countries. By June 2004, Canada's installed capacity was 341 megawatts (MW), compared to 13,407 MW installed by late 2003 in Germany, the country with the largest installed capacity. Canada's current small-scale hydroelectric capacity is about 2000 MW. Canada also has a few grid-connected wood-waste-fired power plants operational or under construction, with a maximum capacity of 60 MW. By 1999, Canada was generating 85.3 MW of electricity from captured municipal landfill gas. It is also worth noting that solar power is now finding niche applications in Canada, despite the fact that its cost remains relatively high (although falling). Canada is a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol. It has committed to reducing its emissions to 6% below 1990 levels by 2008-2012. But Canada's emissions level was already 24% above 1990 levels by 2003. As nearly 90% of all anthropogenic GHG emissions in Canada result from the production and consumption of fossil fuels, meeting the Kyoto target will challenge all Canadian governments and the energy industry to develop new and more effective strategies for speeding the development of sustainable energy to limit GHG emissions. There is an urgent need for analyzing current strategies of sustainable energy in Canada and examining the issues of these strategies. In theory and practice, however, there has so far been no a clear, integrated and comprehensive strategy framework for sustainable energy in Canada. Nor a clear definition of sustainable energy strategy was formulated. In this paper, we attempted to define sustainable energy strategy as the energy strategy aiming at improving energy efficiency and promoting renewable energy. Based on the definition above, we formulated an analytical framework for developing the strategies of sustainable energy. In the analytical framework, (1) sustainable energy strategy embraces strategic objectives, measures and management; (2) sustainable energy strategy is divided into two major groups: energy efficiency strategy and renewable energy strategy; (3) strategy measures of energy efficiency are classified as ten types; and (4) strategy measures of renewable energy are classified as four types. We have employed the framework to analyze current strategic objectives, strategic measures and policy and management strategies concerning sustainable energy in Canada and examine the issues of these strategies. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

These programs are voluntary and aimed at replacement of household vehicles. In contrast, there is a gap in knowledge related to the emissions benefits of government fleet replacement (retirement) programs. In this study, the efficacy of a fleet replacement program for a local government agency in Northern Illinois, the Forest Preserve of DuPage County (FPDC), is examined using a probabilistic vehicle survival model that accounts for time-varying covariates such as vehicle age and gasoline price. The vehicle lifetime operating emissions are calculated based on the estimated vehicle survival probabilities from the survival model and compared with those derived using the EPA default fleet used in MOBILE6 and the fleet represented by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) survival curve. The results suggest that while there may be short term emission benefits of the FPDC fleet replacement plan, the long-term emission benefits are highly sensitive to economic factors (e.g., future gasoline price) and exhibit a decreasing trend. This indicates that an adaptive multi-stage replacement strategy as opposed to a fixed one is preferable to achieve optimal cost effectiveness. © Springer Science+Business Media, LLC. 2007.","Lifetime emissions; Light duty vehicle; Local government fleet; Survival probability; Vehicle scrappage","Cost effectiveness; Economic analysis; Fleet operations; Mathematical models; Probability; Light duty vehicle; Local government fleet; Survival probability; Vehicle scrappage; Transportation; knowledge; local government; modeling; probability; traffic emission; transportation planning; Illinois; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39149130358

Fluidized bed incinerators (FBI) have been widely used as a typical technology for industrial waste treatment in recent years, especially in the petrochemical industry in Japan, Germany, and Taiwan. In response to public concerns, the Environmental Protection Administration (EPA) in Taiwan had proposed strict limits on the emissions of PCDD/Fs for both industrial and municipal incinerators. The emission standard is 0.1 ng/Nm3, expressed as the 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) toxic equivalent of 17 specific dioxins and furans congeners. These limits will potentially influence technology selection and design in combustion processes, energy recovery options, and air pollution control devices. Since fluidized bed incinerators with revolving type combustors have been continuously popular in Taiwan for handling industrial sludge, spent oils, and solid wastes, an interesting exercise is to compare the stack concentrations against the proposed standard of concentrations of dioxins and furans (i.e., 0.1 ng/Nm3 TCDD TEQ (toxicity equivalence) and search for a more cost effective way to improve the control strategy. Research findings in this article confirm that the formation and emissions of PCDD/Fs, prior to particulates control device, exhibit a substantial positive correlation with CO concentration in the flue gases. Without using the technique of activated carbon injection to reduce the emissions of PCDD/Fs, the revolving type FBI cannot comply with the emission standards of PCDD/Fs required in Taiwan.","Activated carbon adsorption; Fluidized bed; Incineration; PCDD/Fs; Waste management","Activated carbon; Adsorption; Flue gases; Particles (particulate matter); Refuse incinerators; Waste management; Activated carbon adsorption; Carbon injection; Positive correlation; Fluidized beds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42649115485

We discuss the issues of two nonspherical and inhomogeneous aerosol types, dust and black carbon, regarding climate radiative forcings. Reduction in uncertainties of their radiative forcings must begin with improvement of the knowledge and understanding of the fundamental scattering and absorption properties associated with their composition and size/shape. The effects of intensive topography, such as that in the Tibetan Plateau, on surface radiation and the radiation field above, are significant and the solution requires a three-dimensional radiative transfer program. We show that in a clear atmosphere, surface net solar flux averaged over a mesoscale domain can differ by 5–20W/m2 between a slope and a flat surface. Accurate calculations and parametrizations of both solar and thermal infrared radiative transfer in mountains must be developed for effective incorporation in regional and global models. The wind–driven air–sea interface is complex and affects the transfer of solar flux from the atmosphere into the ocean and the heating in the ocean mixed layer. We point out the requirement of reliable and efficient parametrizations of the ocean surface roughness associated with surface winds. The scattering and absorption properties of irregular phytoplankton and other species in the ocean must also be determined on the basis of the rigorous theoretical and experimental approaches for application to remote sensing and climate research. © 2008 by World Scientific Publishing Co.

Diagnostic mirrors in ITER will suffer from electromagnetic radiation, energetic particles and neutron irradiation. Erosion due to impact of fast neutrals from plasma and deposition of plasma impurities may significantly degrade optical and polarization characteristics of mirrors influencing the overall performance of the respective diagnostics. Therefore, maintaining the best possible performance of mirrors is of the crucial importance for the ITER optical diagnostics. Mirrors in ITER divertor are expected to suffer from deposition of impurities. The dedicated experiment in a tokamak divertor was needed to address this issue. Investigations with molybdenum diagnostic mirrors were made in DIII-D divertor. Mirror samples were exposed at different temperatures in the private flux region to a series of ELMy H-mode discharges with partially detached divertor plasmas. An increase of temperature of mirrors during the exposure generally led to the mitigation of carbon deposition, primarily due to temperature-enhanced chemical erosion of carbon layers by D atoms. Finally, for the mirrors exposed at the temperature of ∼160 °C neither carbon deposition nor degradation of optical properties was detected. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In 2003, the U.S. Department of Energy created a nationwide network of seven Regional Carbon Sequestration Partnerships (RCSP) to help determine and implement the technology, infrastructure, and regulations most appropriate to promote carbon sequestration in different regions of the nation. The objectives of the Characterization Phase (Phase I) were to characterize the geologic and terrestrial opportunities for carbon sequestration; to identify CO2 point sources within the territories of the individual partnerships; to assess the transportation infrastructure needed for future deployment; to evaluate CO2 capture technologies for existing and future power plants; and to identify the most promising sequestration opportunities that would need to be validated through a series of field projects. The Characterization Phase was highly successful, with the following achievements: established a national network of companies and professionals working to support sequestration deployment; created regional and national carbon sequestration atlases for the United States and portions of Canada; evaluated available and developing technologies for the capture of CO2 from point sources; developed an improved understanding of the permitting requirements that future sequestration activities will need to address as well as defined the gap in permitting requirements for large scale deployment of these technologies; created a raised awareness of, and support for, carbon sequestration as a greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation option, both within industry and among the general public; identified the most promising carbon sequestration opportunities for future field tests; and established protocols for project implementation, accounting, and management. Economic evaluation was started and is continuing and will be a factor in project selection. During the Validation Phase, the seven regional partnerships will put the knowledge learned during the Characterization Phase into practice through field tests that will validate carbon sequestration technologies that are best suited to their respective regions of the country. These tests will verify technologies developed through DOE's core R&amp;D effort and enable implementation of CO2 sequestration on a large scale, should that become necessary. Pilot projects will have a site-specific focus to test technology; assess formation storage capacity and injectivity; validate and refine existing CO2 formation models used to determine the transport and fate of CO2 in the formation; demonstrate the integrity of geologic seals to contain CO2; validate monitoring, mitigation, and verification (MMV) technologies; define project costs and compare costs of alternatives; assess potential operational and long-term storage risks; address regulatory requirements; and engage and evaluate public acceptance of sequestration technologies. Field validation tests involving both sequestration in geologic formations and terrestrial sequestration are being developed. The results from the Validation Phase will help to confirm the estimates made during the Characterization Phase and will be used to update the regional atlases and NatCarb. Answers to many questions about the effectiveness and safety of carbon sequestration technologies will be instrumental in planning for a Deployment Phase, in which large volume tests will be planned to further sequestration as an option that can mitigate GHG emissions in the United States. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In these models, the covalent bonding interactions adapt to the environment, allowing bond strength to change in response to local chemical changes. However, the non-bonded interactions should also adapt in response to chemical changes, an effect which is neglected in current bond-order potentials. Here the AIREBO potential is extended to include adaptive Lennard-Jones terms, allowing the van der Waals interactions to vary adaptively with the chemical environment. The resulting potential energy surface and its gradient remain continuous, allowing it to be used for dynamics simulations. This new potential is parameterized for hydrocarbons, and is fit to the energetics and densities of a variety of condensed phase molecular hydrocarbons. The resulting model is more accurate for modeling aromatic and other unsaturated hydrocarbon species, for which the original AIREBO potential had some deficiencies. Testing on compounds not used in the fitting procedure shows that the new model performs substantially better in predicting heats of vaporization and pressures (or densities) of condensed-phase molecular hydrocarbons. © 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","AIREBO; Bond-order potential; Hydrocarbon; Reactive potential; Van der Waals interactions","Bond-order potential; Reactive potential; Van der Waals interactions; Chemical bonds; Computer simulation; Potential energy surfaces; Reaction kinetics; Van der Waals forces; Hydrocarbons; carbon; hydrocarbon; article; chemical model; chemistry; computer simulation; heat; pressure; thermodynamics; volatilization; Carbon; Computer Simulation; Heat; Hydrocarbons; Models, Chemical; Pressure; Thermodynamics; Volatilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39049156034

Different fresh mixture temperatures and ambient pressures were considered in the simulation to investigate the effects of preheat and pressure on the super-adiabatic flame temperature (SAFT) phenomenon. The occurrence of SAFT in rich CH4/air flames is chemical kinetics in nature and is associated with the overproduction of CH2CO and H2O in the reaction zone followed by their endothermic dissociations in the post-flame region. Preheat lowers the degree of H2O concentration overshoot and results in faster depletion of CH2CO concentration in the post-flame region. Preheat accelerates a rich CH4/air flame to approach equilibrium and suppresses the occurrence of SAFT. Increased pressure reduces the H radical concentration in the reaction zone and increases the overshoot of H2O concentration and the peak concentration of CH2CO. Although pressure also accelerates the approach of a rich CH4/air flame to equilibrium, it actually enhances the degree of SAFT.

To contribute towards an improvement of actual estimates, soil CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes were measured in two different land-use types in a hilly area of South China. This study showed 2 years continuous measurements (twice a week) of GHG fluxes from soils of a pine plantation and a longan orchard system. Impacts of environmental drivers (soil temperature and soil moisture), litter exclusion and land-use (vegetation versus orchard) were presented. Our results suggested that the plantation and orchard soils were weak sinks of atmospheric CH4 and significant sources of atmospheric CO2 and N2O. Annual mean GHG fluxes from soils of plantation and orchard were: CO2 fluxes of 4.70 and 14.72 Mg CO2-C ha-1 year-1, CH4 fluxes of -2.57 and -2.61 kg CH4-C ha-1 year-1, N2O fluxes of 3.03 and 8.64 kg N2O-N ha-1 year-1, respectively. Land use types had great impact on CO2 and N2O emissions. Annual average CO2 and N2O emissions were higher in the orchard than in the plantation, while there were no clear differences in CH4 emissions between two sites. Our results suggest that afforestation could be a potential mitigation strategy to reduce GHG emissions from agricultural soils if the observed results were representative at the regional scale. CO2 and N2O emissions were mainly affected by soil temperature and soil moisture. CH4 uptakes showed significant correlation with soil moisture. The seasonal changes in soil CO2 and N2O fluxes followed the seasonal weather pattern, with high CO2 and N2O emission rates in the rainy period and low rates in the dry period. In contrast, seasonal patterns of CH4 fluxes were not clear. Removal of surface litter reduced soil CO2 effluxes by 17-25% and N2O effluxes by 34-31% in the plantation and orchard in the second sampling year but not in the first sampling year which suggested micro-environmental heterogeneity in soils. Removal of surface litter had no significant effect on CH4 absorption rates in both years. This suggests that microbial CH4 uptake was mainly related to the mineral soil rather than in the surface litter layer. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

We conduct a base and five sensitivity simulations, in which sulfur emissions from each continent are tagged, to establish the source-receptor (S-R) relationship between EA sulfur emissions and sulfate concentrations over source and downwind regions. We find that from west to east across the North Pacific, EA sulfate contributes approximately 80%-20% of sulfate at the surface, but at least 50% at 500 hPa. Surface sulfate concentrations are dominated by local anthropogenic sources. Of the sulfate produced from sources other than local anthropogenic emissions (defined here as ""background"" sulfate), EA sources account for approximately 30%-50% (over the Western US) and 10%-20% (over the Eastern US). The surface concentrations of sulfate from EA sources over the Western US are highest in MAM (up to 0.15 μg/m3), and lowest in DJF (less than 0.06 μg/m3). Reducing EA SO2 emissions will significantly decrease the spatial extent of the EA sulfate influence (represented by the areas where at least 0.1 μg m-3 of sulfate originates from EA) over the North Pacific both at the surface and at 500 hPa in all seasons, but the extent of influence is insensitive to emission increases, particularly in DJF and JJA. We find that EA sulfate concentrations over most downwind regions respond nearly linearly to changes in EA SO2 emissions, but sulfate concentrations over the EA source region increase more slowly than SO 2 emissions, particularly at the surface and in winter, due to limited availability of oxidants (in particular of H2O2, which oxidizes SO2 to sulfate in the aqueous phase). We find that similar estimates of the S-R relationship for trans-Pacific transport of EA sulfate would be obtained using either sensitivity (i.e., varying emissions from a region to examine the effects on downwind concentrations) or tagging techniques. Our findings suggest that future changes in EA sulfur emissions may cause little change in the sulfate-induced health impact over downwind continents. However, SO2 emission reductions may significantly reduce the sulfate concentrations and the resulting negative radiative forcing over the North Pacific and the United States, thus providing a warming tendency.",,"anthropogenic source; atmospheric modeling; concentration (composition); emission; Northern Hemisphere; reduction; sulfate; sulfur dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48249112174

It was found from phase-behavior studies that for a given synthetic surfactant and crude oil containing naphthenic acids, optimal salinity depends only on the ratio of the moles of soap formed from the acids to the moles of synthetic surfactant present. Adsorption of anionic surfactants on carbonate surfaces is reduced substantially by sodium carbonate, but not by sodium hydroxide. The magnitude of the reduction with sodium carbonate decreases with increasing salinity. Particular attention was given to a surfactant blend of a propoxylated sulfate having a slightly branched C16-17 hydrocarbon chain and an internal olefin sulfonate. In contrast to alkyl/aryl sulfonates previously considered for EOR, alkaline solutions of this blend containing neither alcohol nor oil were single-phase micellar solutions at all salinities up to approximately optimal salinity with representative oils. Phase behavior with a west Texas crude oil at ambient temperature in the absence of alcohol was unusual in that colloidal material, perhaps another microemulsion having a higher soap content, was dispersed in the lower-phase microemulsion. Low interfacial tensions existed with the excess oil phase only when this material was present in sufficient amount in the spinning-drop device. Some birefringence was observed near and above optimal conditions. While this phase behavior is somewhat different from the conventional Winsor phase sequence, overall solubilization of oil and brine for this system was high, leading to low interfacial tensions over a wide salinity range and to excellent oil recovery in both dolomite and silica sandpacks. The sandpack experiments were performed with surfactant concentrations as low as 0.2 wt% and at a salinity well below optimal for the injected surfactant. It was necessary that sufficient polymer be present to provide adequate mobility control, and that salinity be below the value at which phase separation occurred in the polymer/surfactant solution. A 1D simulator was developed to model the process. By calculating transport of soap formed from the crude oil and injected surfactant separately, it showed that injection below optimal salinity was successful because a gradient in local soap-to-surfactant ratio developed during the process. This gradient increases robustness of the process in a manner similar to that of a salinity gradient in a conventional surfactant process.

By participating in the CDM, developing countries may end up losing all cheap emissions reduction possibilities, while obtaining little sustainability benefits. This paper proposes rent extraction with a type-by-type scheme as an instrument to incorporate sustainable development into the CDM. The rent extraction with a type-by-type scheme makes it possible for the CDM host country government to discourage the low-cost projects that have little sustainability benefits, and to extract more rent from the projects that are developed. The main challenge of implementing this instrument is the uncertainty of the opportunity cost, but the host country government can adjust the scheme for the uncertainty to achieve its goal. Therefore, the type-by-type scheme will better assist the host country in achieving sustainable development than a single-rate scheme. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

We find a correlation between stellar mass and gas-phase oxygen abundance in the sample and compare it with the one observed among UV-selected z ∼ 2 star-forming galaxies and local objects from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). This comparison, based on the same empirical abundance indicator, demonstrates that the zero point of the M-Z relationship evolves with redshift, in the sense that galaxies at fixed stellar mass become more metal-rich at lower redshift. Measurements of [O III]/Hβ and [N II]/Hα emission-line ratios show that, on average, objects in the DEEP2 1.0 < z < 1.5 sample are significantly offset from the excitation sequence observed in nearby H II regions and SDSS emission-line galaxies. In order to fully understand the causes of this offset, which is also observed in z ∼ 2 star-forming galaxies, we examine in detail the small fraction of SDSS galaxies that have similar diagnostic ratios to those of the DEEP2 sample. Some of these galaxies indicate evidence for AGN and/or shock activity, which may give rise to their unusual line ratios and contribute to Balmer emission lines at the level of ∼20%. Others indicate no evidence for AGN or shock excitation yet are characterized by higher electron densities and temperatures, and therefore interstellar gas pressures, than typical SDSS star-forming galaxies of similar stellar mass. These anomalous objects also have higher concentrations and starformation rate surface densities, which are directly connected to higher interstellar pressure. Higher star formation rate surface densities, interstellar pressures, and H II region ionization parameters may also be common at high redshift. These effects must be taken into account when using strong-line indicators to understand the evolution of heavy elements in galaxies. When such effects are included, the inferred evolution of the M-Z relation out to z ∼ 2 is more significant than previous estimates. © 2008. The American Astronomical Society.

Source sampling systems have commonly utilized partial sampling techniques, which may introduce the potential for particle loss, and steady-state operation, which is incapable of imitating transient engine conditions. In order to simulate atmospheric dilution and aging conditions, maintain proportional sampling throughout temperature excursions during transient operation, and minimize particle loss, while representatively taking multiple samples from the exhaust flow, a full-partial-full source dilution sampling system was developed. The system consists of a critical flow venturi-constant volume system for primary dilution, a thermophoresis-resistant secondary micro-diluter, a residence time chamber, isokinetic sampling probes, multiple sampling trains, and control systems. Further, the system was designed to prevent particle loss and secondary reactions by reducing wall effects, implementing inert materials, optimizing smooth flow transition, and minimizing electrostatic forces. An examination of the system was conducted by performing a tracer study and by determining the variations in flow rates, gaseous concentrations, and PM mass measurements. Further, a statistical analysis was performed to study the capability and performance of the sampling system. The results suggest that the system was capable of collecting similar samples among the sampling trains and displaying sufficient agreement with a certification system. Therefore, the source dilution sampling system developed in this study is suitable for collecting representative samples from an exhaust flow under transient or steady-state conditions.

All trees and shrubs sampled were of the C3 pathway and all grasses of the C4 pathway with the exception of Echinolaena inflexa (Poir.) Chase, a common C3 grass of the Brazilian cerrado. By comparing the carbon isotopic compositions of the plant and carbon pools, a simple model relating soil δ13C to the relative abundances of trees + shrubs (woody plants) and grasses was developed. The model suggests that the relative proportions of a savanna ecosystem's total foliar projected cover attributable to grasses versus woody plants is a simple and reliable index of the relative contributions of grasses and woody plants to savanna net productivity. Model calibrations against woody tree canopy cover made it possible to estimate the proportion of savanna productivity in the major regions of the world attributable to trees + shrubs and grasses from ground-based observational maps of savanna woodiness. Overall, it was estimated that 59% of the net primary productivity (Np) of tropical savannas is attributable to C4 grasses, but that this proportion varies significantly within and between regions. The C4 grasses make their greatest relative contribution to savanna Np in the Neotropics, whereas in African regions, a greater proportion of savanna Np is attributable to woody plants. The relative contribution of C4 grasses in Australian savannas is intermediate between those in the Neotropics and Africa. These differences can be broadly ascribed to large scale differences in soil fertility and rainfall. © 2008 Heron Publishing.","Carbon isotopes; Cerrado; Grasses; Photosynthetic pathway; Soil carbon pool","angiosperm; carbon isotope; cerrado; estimation method; grass; net primary production; photosynthesis; rainfall; relative abundance; savanna; shrub; soil carbon; soil fertility; vegetation; woody plant; Africa; Australasia; Australia; Brazil; Ghana; South America; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa; Echinolaena inflexa; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42049091003

Projected reductions depend on the magnitude of future emissions and on the ability of species to disperse from their current locations. California's varied terrain could cause species to move in very different directions, breaking up present-day floras.

It is assumed that conservation practices have similar benefits to soil whether or not glyphosate-resistant crops are used. This paper reviews the impact on soil of conservation practices and glyphosate-resistant crops, and presents data from a Mississippi field trial comparing glyphosate-resistant and non-glyphosate-resistant maize (Zea mays L.) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) under limited tillage management. RESULTS: Results from the reduced-tillage study indicate differences in soil biological and chemical properties owing to glyphosate-resistant crops. Under continuous glyphosate-resistant maize, soils maintained greater soil organic carbon and nitrogen as compared with continuous non-glyphosate-resistant maize, but no differences were measured in continuous cotton or in cotton rotated with maize. Soil microbial community structure based on total fatty acid methyl ester analysis indicated a significant effect of glyphosate-resistant crop following 5 years of continuous glyphosate-resistant crop as compared with the non-glyphosate-resistant crop system. Results from this study, as well as the literature review, indicate differences attributable to the interaction of conservation practices and glyphosate-resistant crop, but many are transient and benign for the soil ecosystem. CONCLUSIONS: Glyphosate use may result in minor effects on soil biological/chemical properties. However, enhanced organic carbon and plant residues in surface soils under conservation practices may buffer potential effects of glyphosate. Long-term field research established under various cropping systems and ecological regions is needed for critical assessment of glyphosate-resistant crop and conservation practice interactions.","Buffer; Conservation tillage; Cover crop; Environment; Glyphosate; Leach; No-tillage; Pesticide; Pesticide degradation; Reduced tillage; Runoff; Sorption; Transgenic","drug derivative; glycine; glyphosate; herbicide; community structure; environmental impact; glyphosate; microbial community; pesticide resistance; soil conservation; soil microorganism; tillage; agriculture; chemistry; conference paper; cotton; environmental protection; genetics; herbicide resistance; maize; methodology; microbiology; soil; transgenic plant; Agriculture; Conservation of Natural Resources; Glycine; Gossypium; Herbicide Resistance; Herbicides; Plants, Genetically Modified; Soil; Soil Microbiology; Zea mays; Gossypium hirsutum; Zea mays",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41349118029

The purpose of this cohort study was to estimate the relative risk (RR) of acute bronchitis over a period from January 2004 to December 2006 in communities exposed to the volcanic air pollution. A community-based case review was conducted using medical records from clinics and emergency rooms in exposed and unexposed study areas. Initial visits by local residents for diagnosed acute bronchitis were clinically reviewed. The cumulative incidence rate for the 3-yr period was 117.74 per 1000 in unexposed communities and 184.63 per 1000 in exposed communities. RR estimates were standardized for age and gender, revealing an elevated cumulative incidence ratio (CIR) of 1.57 (95% CI = 1.36-1.81) for acute bronchitis in the exposed communities. Highest risk [CIR: 6.56 (95% CI = 3.16-13.6)] was observed in children aged 0-14 yr who resided in the exposed communities.

Kaolinite, illite, interstratified illite-smectite and quartz are the dominant mineral matter components in almost all of the coal samples, with small but significant proportions of pyrite (up to around 15% of the mineral matter) being present in around half of the samples studied. Other minerals present in particular samples include chlorite, muscovite, paragonite, ankerite, dolomite, calcite and siderite, along with phosphate minerals apatite and goyazite. Jarosite and coquimbite are also noted in some of the pyrite-bearing coals, probably representing oxidation products of the pyrite developed with exposure or storage. Bassanite is present in the low-temperature ash of some coals, and in one sample occurs along with significant concentrations of hexahydrite, alunogen, tschermigite and paraluminite, all of which were probably derived from interaction of inorganic elements in the organic matter with organic sulphur during maceral oxidation. Quantitative analysis of the minerals in the low-temperature ash of the coal samples using Rietveld-based X-ray diffraction techniques provides results that are consistent, at least for the most abundant elements, with the chemical composition of the coal ash as determined by standard analysis procedures. The evaluation of mineral-rich concentrates by Mössbauer spectroscopy also provides results consistent with the XRD data, especially as regards pyrite and some of the sulphate components. Optical microscopy indicates that much of the pyrite, and in some cases also the carbonates, occurs as anhedral crystals, finely disseminated in the maceral components, as aggregates of crystals (including pyrite framboids), as fine-grained crystals replacing liptinite, and as fracture fillings. Some sub-angular to rounded quartz grains are also present, possibly of detrital origin, but most other minerals, including the clay minerals, occur mainly as aggregates of intimately admixed mineral and maceral constituents. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Despite its potential to decrease ozone formation, there are some technical challenges that still remain before we can confidently apply the concept of reactivity in the most beneficial manner to reduce ozone concentrations. The goal of this paper is to (1) assess how existing science in this area supports the use of reactivity, particularly, the maximum incremental reactivity, for VOC control under a national policy application and (2) identify where uncertainties exist that could affect such a policy. Box model and air quality model results are used to show that there are ways to describe a chemical's reactivity that are relatively robust across large geographic areas.

Moreover, vehicle exhaust emissions have been the cause of much concern about the effects of urban air pollution on human health. Local authorities need to develop strategies to control vehicular emissions through technological and socioeconomical measures. For this reason, an efficiency assessment of possible future measures to reduce air pollution is required for future traffic planning, regulatory and fiscal initiatives. This paper presents the assessment of several mobility and technology scenarios that can be used for emission reductions in Madrid (Spain) in the period 2004-2012. Pollutants considered are those related to typical air quality problems in urban areas in Europe (SO2, NOx, NMVOC, heavy metals, CO and particulate matter) and CO2 as a greenhouse gas. Results show an expected increase in mobility but a decreasing trend in future traffic-related emissions, except for CO2. This reduction is due to technological improvements linked to European Legislation for road vehicles (Euro Standards). CO2 emissions are expected to increase because the technological improvements will not be able to counteract the effect of the large mobility increase. With regard to control strategies, the most effective measure for emission reductions is fleet renewal. According to the hypotheses made in the paper, this would reduce, on average, the pollutant emission by 16.04%. With regard to CO2 emissions, the use of biofuels and the decrease in mobility are the most effective measures. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim is to find answers to why political interests advocate a specific scalar arrangement. Analyzing informant interviews with top politicians and administrators in four municipal governments in the Gothenburg region of southwestern Sweden, we find that although all recognize the social dilemma, the size and capacity of their local government lead to different scalar arguments about responsibility for climate change. Regardless of municipal size and capacity, however, actors' recommendations finally converge in a pattern of path dependence. Already well-entrenched structures of intermunicipal urban cooperation are seen as the scalarly most appropriate vehicle for addressing the social dilemma and for allocating responsibility for climate-related regional action. This opens up for comparative urban research on how new and existing transboundary urban structures handle climate issues in terms of legitimacy and efficiency.","Climate change; Path dependence; Response capacity; Response space; Responsibility; Scalar politics; Social dilemma; Space of dependence; Space of engagement","climate change; decision making; environmental issue; political discourse; transboundary cooperation; urban planning; Eurasia; Europe; Goteborg; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden; Vastra Gotaland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37049010970

Several researches are available concerning the regulated emissions of biodiesel/diesel blends, but there is a lack of information about non-regulated emissions. In a previous paper [Corrêa, S.M., Arbilla, G., 2006. Emissões de formaldeído e acetaldeído de misturas biodiesel/diesel. Periódico Tchê Química, 3, 54-68], the emissions of aromatic hydrocarbons were reported. In this work, seven carbonyl emissions (formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acrolein, acetone, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, and benzaldehyde) were evaluated by a heavy-duty diesel engine fueled with pure diesel (D) and biodiesel blends (v/v) of 2% (B2), 5% (B5), 10% (B10), and 20% (B20). The tests were conducted using a six cylinder heavy-duty engine, typical of the Brazilian fleet of urban buses, in a steady-state condition under 1000, 1500, and 2000 rpm.

At certain times of the year, PM10 is composed mostly of soil-derived material. The correspondence of air quality violations with intense tillage activities and PM10 composition has focused attention on row crop agriculture as a potential major contributor to PM10. This two-year study compared conservation (CT) and standard tillage (ST) systems in dairy forage production to determine if, and to what extent, CT can reduce agricultural PM10. Vertical profiling methods were used to calculate PM10 emission factors for both systems at two farm locations. Test results showed CT reduced PM10 emissions by about 85% on both farms in spring 2004 and by 52% on one farm to 93% on another farm in spring 2005. PM10 reductions were mainly due to the fewer number of tillage operations in CT systems (zero or one operation compared to three to six in ST) and the higher soil water contents at which CT operations can be performed. Aside from soil moisture, degree of soil pulverization, characterized in the second year of this study by weighted mean ped diameter (WMPD) also proved to be an important determinant of PM10 emissions. The ST second disking always had a higher PM10 emission factor than the first disking despite any change in soil water content. The WMPD decreased 39% between the two diskings. Large discrepancies between PM10 emission factors measured in this study and those used for regulatory purposes in California emphasize the continued need to refine monitoring strategies under varying field conditions to improve accuracy of emission factors and to understand how soil and cropping management affect dust production. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In Sweden replacing electric and oil heating systems with innovative heating systems such as district heating, heat pumps and wood pellet boilers in detached homes is a significant mitigation option. Using an adopter-centric approach, we analyzed the influence of investment subsidy on conversion of resistance heaters and oil boilers, and the variation in diffusion pattern of district heating, heat pumps and pellet boilers in Swedish detached homes. Results from questionnaire surveys of 1500 randomly selected homeowners in September 2004 and January 2007 showed that more than 80% of the respondents did not intend to install a new heating system. Hence, about 37% of the homeowners still have electric and oil heating systems. The government investment subsidy was important for conversion from a resistance heater, but not from an oil boiler. This is because homeowners currently replacing their oil boilers are the laggards, while those replacing resistance heaters are the 'early adopters'. Economic aspects and functional reliability were the most important factors for the homeowners when considering a new heating system. There is a variation in the perceived advantages associated with each of the innovative heating systems and therefore, the diffusion patterns of such systems vary. Installers and interpersonal sources were the most important communication channels for information on heating systems. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Methods and Materials: This retrospective study analyzed 16 patients with malignant glioma (4 patients, anaplastic astrocytoma; 12 patients, glioblastoma multiforme) treated with surgery and carbon ion radiotherapy from April 2002 to Nov 2005. The MET-PET target volume was compared with gross tumor volume and CTV, defined by using computed tomography/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Correlations with treatment results were evaluated between positive and negative extended volumes (EVs) of the MET-PET target for CTV. Results: Mean volumes of the MET-PET targets, CTV1 (defined by means of high-intensity volume on T2-weighted MRI), and CTV2 (defined by means of contrast-enhancement volume on T1-weighted MRI) were 6.35, 264.7, and 117.7 cm3, respectively. Mean EVs of MET-PET targets for CTV1 and CTV2 were 0.6 and 2.2 cm3, respectively. The MET-PET target volumes were included in CTV1 and CTV2 in 13 (81.3%) and 11 patients (68.8%), respectively. Patients with a negative EV for CTV1 had significantly greater survival rate (p = 0.0069), regional control (p = 0.0047), and distant control time (p = 0.0267) than those with a positive EV. Distant control time also was better in patients with a negative EV for CTV2 than those with a positive EV (p = 0.0401). Conclusions: For patients with malignant gliomas, MET-PET has a possibility to be a predictor of outcome in carbon ion radiotherapy. Direct use of MET-PET fused to planning computed tomography will be useful and yield favorable results for the therapy. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Measurements were made during the cotton-growing season (May-November) and the fallow period (December-April). Of the total 95 sampling dates, 77 showed positive N2O fluxes (range, 0.1 to 33.3g N ha-1 d-1), whereas negative fluxes (i.e., N2O sink activity) were recorded on 18 occasions (range, -0.1 to -2.2g N ha-1 d-1). Nitrous oxide sink activity was more frequently observed during the growing season (15 out of 57 sampling dates) as compared to the fallow period (3 out of 38 sampling dates). During the growing season, contribution of N2O to the denitrification gaseous N products was much less (average, 4%) as compared to that during the fallow period (average, 21%). Nitrous oxide emission integrated over the 6-month growing period amounted 324g N ha-1, whereas the corresponding figure for the 6-month fallow period was 648g N ha-1. Subtracting the N 2O sink activity (30.3g N ha-1 and 3.8g N ha-1 during the growing season and fallow period, respectively), the net N 2O emission amounted 938g N ha-1 a-1. Results suggested that high soil moisture and temperature prevailing under flood-irrigated cotton in the Central Punjab region of Pakistan though favor high denitrification rates, but are also conducive to N2O reduction thus leading to relatively low N2O emission. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Cotton; Denitrification; Greenhouse emissions; Irrigation; Nitrous oxide; Nitrous oxide mole fraction","cotton; denitrification; fallow; fertilizer application; growing season; irrigation; measurement method; nitrous oxide; quantitative analysis; semiarid region; soil emission; soil moisture; soil temperature; subtropical region; urea; Asia; Eurasia; Pakistan; Punjab [Pakistan]; South Asia; Gossypium hirsutum; Insectivora",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43349083055

Increasingly, the Water Framework Directive (WFD) will provide the basis for the integrated management of European waters, but there is a more immediate need for action to safeguard designated wildlife sites from the effects of eutrophication and siltation. We outline the policy drivers behind the control of these pollution problems, the nature and extent of ecological risks and approaches to target-based management within catchments. Tackling diffuse sources of P and silt requires accurate apportionment of local sources and contributing areas, and integration of practical action with the development of an improved quantitative understanding of the management changes needed in catchments to meet environmental objectives. Such an approach can be used to refine policies on land-based emissions of these pollutants and operational strategies for control. The critical role of catchment appraisal through modelling within this approach is stressed. Management measures to control agricultural sources of P and silt will also help to address other key catchment management objectives (flood risk management, water resource management, terrestrial and wetland habitat restoration). Climate change predictions indicate that the need for integrated catchment management, to increase the resilience of catchments, wildlife and people to extremes of weather conditions (drought and flood) and temperature trends, has never been greater. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Observations for the European part of Russia and for Siberia have been used in this analysis. A statistical correlation between drought indices calculated by use of monthly sums of temperature and precipitation and the frequency of fire danger was obtained for the forest zone of Russia. The change in fire danger potential was evaluated using temperature and precipitation monthly means at the nodes of a regular spatial grid. Climate change scenarios were obtained from Global Climate Models (GCM) ensemble projections.

Specific break-even analyses are developed by introducing further indicators, with the aim of assessing the conditions for which different types of combined systems and conventional separate production systems are equivalent in terms of GHG emissions. The various emission indicators are evaluated and discussed for a number of relevant application cases concerning cogeneration and trigeneration solutions with different types of equipment. Scenario analyses are carried out to assess the possible emission reduction benefits from extended diffusion of cogeneration and trigeneration in regions characterized by different energy generation frameworks. The results strongly depend on the available technologies for combined production, on the composition of the energy generation mix, and on the trend towards upgrading the various generation systems. The numerical outcomes indicate that cogeneration and trigeneration solutions could bring significant benefits in countries with prevailing electricity production from fossil fuels, quantified by the use of the proposed indicators. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this field, the petroleum trap is a stratigraphic trap characterized by microbial boundstone and packstone and nearshore grainstone and packstone reservoirs that are underlain and overlain by lime mudstone and dolomudstone to wackestone and that grade into lime mudstone and dolomudstone near the depositional updip limit of the Smackover Formation. Reservoir rocks trend from southwest to northeast in the field area. The grainstone and packstone reservoir is thickest in the central part of the field. The boundstone reservoir is thickest in local buildups that are composed of thrombolites in the southern part of the field and is absent along the northern margin. These reservoir facies are interpreted to have accumulated in water depths of approximately 3m (10 ft) and in 5 km (3 mi) of the paleoshoreline. In contrast to most other thrombolites identified in the Gulf coastal plain, these buildups did not grow directly on paleohighs associated with Paleozoic crystalline rocks.

Post-deposition treatment of the precursor LB multilayers of cadmium arachidate with H2S gas followed by intercalation of Zn2+ ions and further sulfidation result in the formation of CdS/ZnS nanoparticles in the LB film. The formation of these nanoparticles and resulting changes in layered structures were studied by FTIR and X-ray reflection measurements. The optical properties were studied using UV-vis absorption and photoluminescence spectroscopy. A red-shift in the absorption spectrum and enhancement of CdS excitonic emission together with reduction of surface states emission suggest that after the intercalation step, a thin layer of ZnS surrounds the CdS nanoparticles, thus forming a core-shell structure. Subsequent to the second sulfidation, a further red-shift in absorption suggests the formation of a thicker ZnS coating on CdS. Electron diffraction of CdS nanoparticles coated with thicker ZnS showed the diffraction patterns of only ZnS, as expected for core-shell structures. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Traditional intersections force vehicular traffic to slow down and stop in varying patterns and contribute to the increase in vehicular emissions. Modern roundabouts in US have enhanced the performance and safety of many intersections. There are numerous studies conducted by IIHS and various researchers, which support this fact. These modern roundabouts are not only capable of improving traffic flow but they can as well cut down vehicular emissions and fuel consumption by reducing the vehicle idle time at intersections and thereby creating a positive impact on the environment. The primary focus of this research was to study the impact of modern roundabouts in cutting down vehicular emissions. Six sites with different traffic volume ranges, where a modern roundabout has replaced stop-controlled intersection, have been chosen for the study. The operation of the roadways at the intersection was videotaped and the traffic flow data was extracted from these tapes and analyzed using SIDRA (signalized and un-signalized intersection design and research aid) software. The version used was aaSIDRA 2.0. The software produces many Measures of Effectiveness (MOEs) of which four were chosen for analyzing the environmental impact of roundabouts. The chosen four outputs give rate of emission of HC, CO, NOX, and CO2 in (kg/h). All the MOEs were statistically compared to determine which intersection control performed better. After comparing all the MOEs at all locations for the before and after traffic volumes, it was found that the modern roundabout performed better than the existing intersection control (i.e. stop signs) in cutting down vehicular emissions therefore creating a positive impact on the environment. The research concludes that a modern roundabout can be used as a viable alternative to cut down vehicular emissions, making intersections more environmentally friendly. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Although the water purification effect of riparian ecosystems has been well studied, there is little knowledge of their internal cycling, especially in the area of gaseous emissions. We measured fluxes of nitrous oxide (N2O), dinitrogen (N2), methane (CH4), and carbon dioxide (CO2) in riparian grey alder stands in southern Estonia and black alder stands in Brandenburg, Germany. Dinitrogen emission was the most important component in N retention in the studied riparian grey alder forests. In 2001-2003, the median values of N2 emission in the grey alder sites significantly exceeded the N2 emission rates in the black alder sites, varying from 700 to 1200 and from 360 to 400 kg N2-N ha-1 year-1, respectively. In contrast, the median values of N 2O flux were higher in the black alder sites than in the grey alder sites, i.e., 0.9-2.6 and 0.2-0.7 kg N2O-N ha-1 year -1, respectively. The black alder sites acted as a sink for CH 4, whereas the grey alder sites emitted a small amount of CH 4. The CO2-C flux was higher in the black alder stands. The estimated N2-N emission in the grey alder stands for 1994-1995 was 51.2, whereas N2O-N emission was 0.5 kg N ha-1 year-1. The significant increase in N2 emission from 1994-1995 to 2001-2003 can be related to changes in microbial activity during the succession of the pioneer grey alder stand into a more stable mixed forest community. Due to CO2 fluxes and N2O fluxes from sites with altered water regime, the estimated GWP of the studied riparian alder stands was relatively high. Further investigations should concentrate on the factors that regulate rates of N2O and N2 emission from riparian buffer zones.",,"Alnus; Alnus glutinosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47049092679

In the region of a breather one can observe intensive out-of-plane motion of carbon atoms and relatively small displacements in the plane of the zigzag. In spite of this smallness, the ""secondary"" nonlinear effects turn out to be crucial for the existence of breathers. Both the existence and stability of low-frequency breathers in free motion are confirmed by computer simulation, using the Molecular Dynamics (MD) procedure. The stability of breathers with respect to thermal excitations as well as to mutual collisions and collisions with optical breathers is also discussed.

In such cases a very close control over the air fuel ratio will be needed. In this work a carbureted 125cc small capacity two-wheeler engine was modified to operate with Port Fuel Injection (PFI) for improved control over the air fuel ratio. A throttle body was specially made to house the injector and a position sensor. A cam position sensor, crank angle sensor, manifold air pressure (MAP) sensor, 60-2 toothed wheel for precise control of the events on the angle basis were used. Extensive tests were conducted with the throttle body and fuel injector to obtain the mathematical models for the inlet manifold and fuel injector. These were used to make the model based controller. The dSPACE - Micro Auto Box platform was used to develop and test the control algorithms. Software was written using SIMULINK. The closed loop PID algorithm was used for air-fuel ratio control and map based spark time control for steady state operation and model based control during the transient operation. The controller is able to maintain air fuel ratio as demanded in both steady and transient conditions in the test bed and there are significant improvements in CO, HC, NOX emissions and fuel consumption as compared to the carbureted operation.

Case analysis of the ‘Emissions Biodiversity Exchange Project for the 21st Century’ (EBEX21) program of Landcare Research New Zealand are then used to reveal ways in which similar constraints have been successfully addressed in the context of marginal pastures in New Zealand. The EBEX21 program demonstrates how a government policy initiative can provide support to landowners by: (1) informing landowners about carbon trading opportunities; (2) ensuring satisfactory regeneration of woodlands (including the use of appropriate practices for fire and livestock exclusion and pest and weed management); (3) helping landowners measure and verify their carbon credits; and (4) providing a transparent system (through carboNZero) for landowners to engage with potential buyers of carbon credits. © 2008, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Ecosystem services; Market-based instruments; Woodland regeneration","ecosystem service; emissions trading; land management; landownership; pasture; policy strategy; profitability; regeneration; state role; woodland; Australasia; Australia; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48249112182

First, we compress the material along the nominal [0 0 1] direction, resulting in a highly symmetric configuration that results in high stresses. Second, we load the material along the high-index [over(4, ̄) 8 19] direction to confine plasticity to a single slip system and break the symmetry. We find that the plastic response under these two conditions is strikingly different, the former governed by dislocation loop emission and dipole formation, while the latter is dominated by twinning. We calculate the irreversible plastic work budget derived from a loading-unloading cycle and identify the most relevant yield points. These calculations represent the first fully three-dimensional, fully non-local simulations of any body-centered cubic metal using QC. © 2008 Acta Materialia Inc.","EOS; Nanovoid collapse; Quasicontinuum method; Shocks; Strength of Ta","Boundary conditions; Computer simulation; Deformation; Single crystals; Strength of materials; Stress analysis; Cyclic uniaxial deformation; Nanovoid collapse; Quasicontinuum (QC) methods; Tantalum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43649091390

The Northwest Power and Conservation Council (NWPCC), an interstate compact agency, has conducted long term planning for the PNW electricity supply for its 2005 Power Plan. In formulating its power portfolio recommendation, the NWPCC explored uncertainty in variables that affect the availability and cost of electricity over the next 20 years. The NWPCC conducted an initial assessment of potential impacts of climate change on the hydropower system, but these results are not incorporated in the risk model upon which the 2005 Plan recommendations are based. To assist in bringing climate information into the planning process, we present an assessment of uncertainty in future PNW hydropower generation potential based on a comprehensive set of climate models and greenhouse gas emissions pathways. We find that the prognosis for PNW hydropower supply under climate change is worse than anticipated by the NWPCC's assessment. Differences between the predictions of individual climate models are found to contribute more to overall uncertainty than do divergent emissions pathways. Uncertainty in predictions of precipitation change appears to be more important with respect to impact on PNW hydropower than uncertainty in predictions of temperature change. We also find that a simple regression model captures nearly all of the response of a sequence of complex numerical models to large scale changes in climate. This result offers the possibility of streamlining both top-down impact assessment and bottom-up adaptation planning for PNW water and energy resources. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Costs; Electricity; Energy resources; Greenhouse gases; Power generation; Cost of electricity; Hydropower system; Climate change; assessment method; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; electricity supply; greenhouse gas; numerical model; resource management; North America; Pacific Northwest",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41049103480

This paper examines scientific and political representations of Arctic indigenous peoples that have been central to the production and articulation of these claims. ACIA employs novel forms and strategies of representation that reflect changing conceptual models and practices of global change science and depict indigenous peoples as expert, exotic, and at-risk. These portrayals emerge alongside the growing political activism of Arctic indigenous peoples who present themselves as representatives or embodiments of climate change itself as they advocate for climate change mitigation policies. These mutually constitutive forms of representation suggest that scientific ways of seeing the global environment shape and are shaped by the public image and voice of global citizens. Likewise, the authority, credibility, and visibility of Arctic indigenous activists derive, in part, from their status as at-risk experts, a status buttressed by new scientific frameworks and methods that recognize and rely on the local experiences and knowledges of indigenous peoples. Analyses of these relationships linking scientific and political representations of Arctic climate change build upon science and technology studies (STS) scholarship on visualization, challenge conventional notions of globalization, and raise questions about power and accountability in global climate change research. © SSS and SAGE Publications.","Climate change; Global environmental change; Globalization; Indigenous knowledge; Indigenous peoples; Representation; Visualization","Arctic; article; climate; ethnic and racial groups; history; human; Arctic Regions; Climate; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Population Groups",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43949092760

The pilot plant has been designed by integration of a catalytic fixed bed reactor (FBR) with a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR). The CSTR is used as reservoir for the continuous delivering of a recirculation stream through the catalytic bed. The main part of phenol mineralization takes place by catalytic oxidation in the FBR. The mesoporous SBA-15 silica-supported iron oxide (Fe2O 3/SBA-15) agglomerated with bentonite has been selected as catalyst, according to preliminary studies for the continuous treatment of phenolic aqueous solutions in a catalytic packed-bed reactor operating in upflow (1). The efficiency of the wet peroxide oxidation treatment under different operation conditions has been evaluated in terms of phenol degradation, total organic carbon (TOC) reduction and hydrogen peroxide conversion. Among the main operation conditions, the feed and recirculation liquid flow rates, the catalyst loading and the temperature in the CSTR were studied. The increase of the residence time as the feed flow rate is reduced has shown a remarkable improvement of the process efficiency, whereas the variation of the recirculation flow through the FBR has slightly affected the overall catalytic performance. A significant enhancement of the process efficiency has been also found as the temperature of the CSTR was increased up to 80 °C. Under the most favourable operating conditions, phenol was almost totally degraded (99%) and TOC was reduced up to ca. 63% at steady-state conditions. In concern to the catalyst stability, a low dissolution of iron within the aqueous solution during the process has been proven. © 2008 Science &amp; Technology Network, Inc.","Fenton; Fixed bed reactor; Phenol; Pilot plant scale; SBA-15; Wet peroxide oxidation","Biodegradation; Catalysts; Chemical reactors; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Efficiency; Effluents; Hematite; Organic carbon; Oxidation; Packed beds; Peroxides; Phenols; Pilot plants; Silica; Fenton; Fixed bed reactor; Pilot plant scale; SBA-15; Wet peroxide oxidation; Catalytic oxidation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949180621

The study was performed under three different land use scenarios: (1) forest; (2) abandoned agricultural field; and (3) non-irrigated olive grove. Experimental erosion plots (in olive grove and forest) and sediment traps (in the abandoned area) were used to determine the carbon pools associated with sediments and runoff after each event occurring between September 2005 and November 2006. Change in land use from forest to cultivated enhanced the risk of erosion (total soil loss in olive cropland seven-fold higher than in the forest area) and reduced the soil carbon stock (in the top 5 cm) by about 50%. Mineral-associated organic carbon (MOC) represented the main C pool in the three study areas although its contribution to soil organic carbon (SOC) was significantly higher in the disturbed areas (78.91 ± 1.81% and 77.29 ± 1.21% for abandoned and olive area, respectively) than in the forest area (66.05 ± 3.11%). In both, the olive and abandoned soils, the reduction in particulate organic carbon (POC) was proportionally greater than the decline in MOC. The higher degree of sediment production in the olive cropland had an important consequence in terms of the carbon losses induced by erosion compared to the abandoned and forest plots. Thus, the total OC lost by erosion in the sediments was around three times higher in the cultivated (5.12 g C m-2) than the forest plot (1.77 g C m-2). The abandoned area displayed similar OC losses as a result of erosion as the forest plot (in the measurement period: 2.07 g C m-2, 0.63 g C m-2 and 0.65 g C m-2 for olive, forest and abandoned area, respectively). MOC represented the highest percentage of contribution to total sediment OC for all the events analysed and in all uses being, in general these values higher in Olive (74-90%) than in the other two areas (55-80%). The organic carbon lost was basically linked to the solid phase in the three land uses, although the contribution of DOC to total carbon loss by erosion varied widely with each event. Data from this study show that the more labile OC fraction (POC) lost in soil in the cultivated area was mainly due to the effect of cultivation (low overall biomass production and residue return together with high C mineralization) rather than to water erosion, given that the major part of the OC lost in sediments was in the form of MOC. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In particular, it has been used to reconstruct the sequence of aeolian morphogenetic phases along the Apulia and Basilicata coasts (Southern Italy). In these areas, three main Holocene morphogenetic phases have been recognized using radiocarbon data obtained from sub-fossil terrestrial gastropods, archaeological data and OSL analyses: those of the Middle Holocene period, of the Greek-Roman time and of the Middle Ages. Sub-fossil terrestrial gastropods have been considered suitable indicators in the detecting Holocene climate-environmental changes. However, it is well-known that they could show problems as chronological indicators mainly due to aging effects induced by: (i) micro-particles of calcite/aragonite in the shell structure, derived from the local substratum and (ii) a variation of CO2 content in the plants eaten. In order to verify these hypotheses, living terrestrial gastropods were collected from coastal areas and analysed using AMS. The results indicate that many living gastropods gave ages of 1500 years older than those expected, thus confirming the aging effect. As 14C ages of Middle and Late Holocene aeolian morphogenetic phases, obtained from terrestrial gastropods, seem to be confirmed by archaeological data and OSL analyses. The aim of this work is to verify if the age anomalies obtained from modern gastropods could be extended to the entire Holocene period. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.",,"age determination; eolian process; gastropod; Holocene; morphogenesis; radiocarbon dating; subfossil; Eurasia; Europe; Italy; Southern Europe; Gastropoda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44249115110

Since elevated particulate matter concentrations are encountered throughout the year, the accurate forecast of the day-to-day variability in PM2.5 and constituent concentrations over annual cycles poses considerable challenges. In efforts to characterize forecast model performance during different seasons, PM2.5 forecast simulations with the Eta-Community Multiscale Air Quality system are compared with measurements from a variety of regional surface networks, with special emphasis on performance during the winter period. The analysis suggests that while the model can capture the average spatial trends and dynamic range in PM2.5 and constituent concentrations measured at individual sites, significant variability occurs on a day-to-day basis both in the measurements and the model predictions, which are generally not well correlated when paired both in space and time. Systematic overpredictions in regional PM2.5 forecasts during the cool season are noted through comparisons with measurements from different networks. The overpredictions are typically more pronounced at urban locations, with larger errors at the higher concentration range. Variability in aerosol sulfate concentrations were captured well, as well as the relative amounts of sulfur (IV) and sulfur (VI). The mix of carbon sources as represented by the ratio of organic to elemental carbon is captured well in the southeastern United States, but the total carbonaceous aerosol mass is underestimated. On average, during the wintertime the largest overpredictions among individual PM2.5 constituents were noted for the ""other"" category which predominantly represents primary-emitted trace elements in the current model configuration. The systematic errors in model predictions of both total PM2.5 and its constituents during the winter period are found to arise from a combination of uncertainties in the magnitude and spatial and temporal allocation of primary PM2.5 emissions, current uncertainties in the estimation of chemical production pathways for secondary constituents (e.g., NO3-), and the representation of the impacts of boundary layer mixing on simulated concentrations, especially during nighttime conditions.

This is a critical step forward toward the development of improved integrated assessment models of environmental change. We apply the method to examine the economic consequences of air pollution on human health for the US for the period from 1970 to 2000. The pollutants include tropospheric ozone, nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and particulate matter. We apply this method to the MIT Emissions Prediction and Policy Analysis (EPPA) model, a computable general equilibrium model of the economy that has been widely used to study climate change policy. The method makes use of traditional valuation studies, incorporating this information so that estimates of welfare change are consistent with welfare valuation of the consumption of market goods and services. We estimate the benefits of air pollution regulations in USA rose steadily from 1975 to 2000 from $50 billion to $400 billion (from 2.1% to 7.6% of market consumption). Our estimated benefits of regulation are somewhat lower than the original estimates made by the US Environmental Protection Agency, and we trace that result to our development of a stock model of pollutant exposure that predicts that the benefits from reduced chronic air pollution exposure will only be gradually realized. We also estimate the economic burden of uncontrolled levels of air pollution over that period.

Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is of interest to the scientific community as one way of achieving significant global reductions of atmospheric CO2 emissions in the medium term. CO2 would be captured from large stationary sources such as power plants and transported via pipelines under high pressure conditions to underground storage. If a downward leakage from a surface transportation system module occurs, the CO2 would undergo a large temperature reduction and form a bank of ""dry ice"" on the ground surface; the sublimation of the gas from this bank represents an area source term for subsequent atmospheric dispersion, with an emission rate dependent on the energy balance at the bank surface. Gaseous CO2 is denser than air and tends to remain close to the surface; it is an asphyxiant, a cerebral vasodilator and at high concentrations causes rapid circulatory insufficiency leading to coma and death. Hence a subliming bank of dry ice represents safety hazard. A model is presented for evaluating the energy balance and sublimation rate at the surface of a solid frozen CO2 bank under different environmental conditions. The results suggest that subliming gas behaves as a proper dense gas (i.e. it remains close to the ground surface) only for low ambient wind speeds. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In a southwestern USA grassland, our objectives were to describe 1) the accumulation beneath Prosopis velutina (velvet mesquite) and isolated grass plants, and 2) the loss of accumulated nutrients 40 y after P. velutina death. We compared organic carbon (OC), total nitrogen (TN) and δ13C in soil organic matter among large living, large dead, and small living P. velutina and open grassland, and between grass plants and bare ground. Soil samples were collected at 0-5, 5-10, 16.8-23.2, and 36.8-43.2 cm depths, and separated into five size/density fractions: particulate organic matter (Macro- and Micro-POM), mineral associated organic matter (Micro-MAOM), Silt, and Clay. We expected that differences in OC, TN, and δ13C among soil fractions would suggest mechanisms and rates of accumulation with P. velutina persistence and loss following P. velutina death. Soil OC and TN accumulation was ~ 80-750% greater for large P. velutina than open grassland for whole soil and 4 of 5 fractions at 0-5 cm depth, but only 50-250% greater at 5-10 cm depth for whole soil and 3 of 5 fractions. Total OC and TN accumulation at 0-10 cm depth was 6.12 kg C m- 2 and 0.55 kg N m- 2, respectively. Accumulation did not occur in whole soil or any fraction at 16.8-23.2 cm and 36.8-43.2 cm depths, or in the Micro-MAOM fraction at any depth. Accumulation under small P. velutina was less than large plants, and not significantly different from open grassland. Beneath isolated grass plants, accumulation of TN occurred at 0-5 cm depth, and OC accumulation at 0-5 and 5-10 cm depths in whole soils only, but change in δ13C did not accompany accumulations. Forty years after death of large P. velutina, 67-106% of accumulated OC and TN were lost from whole soil and soil fractions at 0-5 cm depth. At 5-10 cm depth, loss (78-93%) was only detected in whole soils. Greater accumulation of OC and TN in the POM than the Silt and Clay fractions is consistent with the large physical size of recent organic matter inputs from P. velutina, but no differences in loss rates among fractions following P. velutina death suggests density dependent rates of organic matter consumption. Declines in δ13C accompanied OC accumulation and increases occurred during loss. A 20-30 y mean residence time (MRT) for whole soil and the Clay fraction over those 40 y is suggested by changes in OC and δ13C, but MRT based on changes in OC and δ13C differ for Macro-POM (1-3 y versus 20-25 y, respectively) and Silt (&gt; 50 y versus 20-30 y, respectively).

Previous work has identified pipeline transport of liquid CO2 as the most economical method of transport for large volumes of CO2. However, there is little published work on the economics of CO2 pipeline transport. The objective of this paper is to estimate total cost and the cost per tonne of transporting varying amounts of CO2 over a range of distances for different regions of the continental United States. An engineering-economic model of pipeline CO2 transport is developed for this purpose. The model incorporates a probabilistic analysis capability that can be used to quantify the sensitivity of transport cost to variability and uncertainty in the model input parameters. The results of a case study show a pipeline cost of US$ 1.16 per tonne of CO2 transported for a 100 km pipeline constructed in the Midwest handling 5 million tonnes of CO2 per year (the approximate output of an 800 MW coal-fired power plant with carbon capture). For the same set of assumptions, the cost of transport is US$ 0.39 per tonne lower in the Central US and US$ 0.20 per tonne higher in the Northeast US. Costs are sensitive to the design capacity of the pipeline and the pipeline length. For example, decreasing the design capacity of the Midwest US pipeline to 2 million tonnes per year increases the cost to US$ 2.23 per tonne of CO2 for a 100 km pipeline, and US$ 4.06 per tonne CO2 for a 200 km pipeline. An illustrative probabilistic analysis assigns uncertainty distributions to the pipeline capacity factor, pipeline inlet pressure, capital recovery factor, annual O&amp;M cost, and escalation factors for capital cost components. The result indicates a 90% probability that the cost per tonne of CO2 is between US$ 1.03 and US$ 2.63 per tonne of CO2 transported in the Midwest US. In this case, the transport cost is shown to be most sensitive to the pipeline capacity factor and the capital recovery factor. The analytical model elaborated in this paper can be used to estimate pipeline costs for a broad range of potential CCS projects. It can also be used in conjunction with models producing more detailed estimates for specific projects, which requires substantially more information on site-specific factors affecting pipeline routing. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition resulting from urbanization has the potential to change those spatial patterns via resource inputs, resulting in more homogeneous soil resource availability. We sampled soils at 12 desert remnant sites around Phoenix, Arizona along a model-predicted gradient in N deposition to determine the degree to which deposition has altered spatial patterns in soil resource availability and microbial activity. Soil microbial biomass and abundance were not influenced by atmospheric N deposition. Instead, plant islands remained strong organizers of soil microbial processes. These islands of fertility exhibited elevated pools of resources, microbial abundance, and activity relative to interspaces. In both plant islands and interspaces, soil moisture and soil N concentrations predicted microbial biomass and abundance. Following experimental wetting, carbon dioxide (CO 2) flux from soil of interspaces was positively correlated with N deposition, whereas in plant islands, soil CO2 flux was positively correlated with soil moisture content and soil organic matter. Soil CO 2 flux in both patch types showed rapid and short-lived responses to precipitation, demonstrating the brief time scales during which soil biota may process deposited materials. Although we observed patterns consistent with N limitation of microbes in interspaces, we conclude that atmospheric N deposition likely accumulates in soils because microbes are primarily limited by water and secondarily by carbon or nitrogen. Soil microbial uptake of atmospherically deposited N likely occurs only during sparse and infrequent rainfall. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Atmospheric nitrogen deposition; Islands of fertility; Phoenix, AZ; Soil microbes; Soil respiration; Sonoran Desert","atmospheric deposition; desert soil; microbial activity; nutrient uptake; resource availability; soil fertility; soil microorganism; soil nitrogen; soil respiration; urbanization; Arizona; North America; Phoenix; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42049091215

The Speciation of Organics for Apportionment of PM2.5 in the New York City Area (SOAP) project was conducted from May 2002 to May 2003 at four sites in New York City, New Jersey, and Connecticut. Its chief objectives were to expand the chemical characterization of organic compounds and to estimate the source contributions of carbonaceous fine particles at urban and background monitoring sites. Two major challenges were faced in order to successfully implement the SOAP sampling network. First, collection of adequate fine PM mass was necessary for successful quantitation of organic marker compounds. Second, sufficiently low blank levels were required for each marker compound for accurate identification and quantitation needed for source-receptor modeling. Initial field tests of representative samplers designed for sampling PM chemical species indicated insufficient sample mass collection, unless analytical sensitivity for organic markers could be greatly improved. Adequate PM mass was collected using a Tisch TE-1202 sampler that operated at a much higher flow rate (113 lpm). Preliminary field tests also revealed unacceptably high travel blank levels for n-alkanes and carboxylic acids. The mass of organic marker compounds observed on travel blank filters was reduced significantly by shipping filters in sealed filter holders. Further evaluation of the Tisch TE-1202 sampler also demonstrated the sampler was free of organic components and impactor grease upstream of the filter. These features also reduced the contribution of carbonaceous species to system blanks and therefore, to the total mass collected. As a result, blank levels for hopanes, PAHs, and dicarboxylic acids were below limits of detection (LOD), and n-alkanes (C25 to C32), n-alkanoic acids (C12, C14, C16, and C18), and phthalic acid exhibited acceptable low levels in all SOAP blanks ranging from 1 to 10 times the limit of detection for each compound class. Overall, adequate sample mass and sufficiently low blank levels were achieved successfully with the SOAP fine particle collection protocol.

Climate change is expected to exacerbate regional mortality events; however, prediction remains difficult because the physiological mechanisms underlying drought survival and mortality are poorly understood. We developed a hydraulically based theory considering carbon balance and insect resistance that allowed development and examination of hypotheses regarding survival and mortality. Multiple mechanisms may cause mortality during drought. A common mechanism for plants with isohydric regulation of water status results from avoidance of drought-induced hydraulic failure via stomatal closure, resulting in carbon starvation and a cascade of downstream effects such as reduced resistance to biotic agents. Mortality by hydraulic failure per se may occur for isohydric seedlings or trees near their maximum height. Although anisohydric plants are relatively drought-tolerant, they are predisposed to hydraulic failure because they operate with narrower hydraulic safety margins during drought. Elevated temperatures should exacerbate carbon starvation and hydraulic failure. Biotic agents may amplify and be amplified by drought-induced plant stress. Wet multidecadal climate oscillations may increase plant susceptibility to drought-induced mortality by stimulating shifts in hydraulic architecture, effectively predisposing plants to water stress. Climate warming and increased frequency of extreme events will probably cause increased regional mortality episodes. Isohydric and anisohydric water potential regulation may partition species between survival and mortality, and, as such, incorporating this hydraulic framework may be effective for modeling plant survival and mortality under future climate conditions. © The Authors (2008).","Climate; Die-off; Hydraulics; Vegetation mortality; Water relations","carbon balance; climate change; drought stress; hydraulics; hypothesis testing; mortality; phytosociology; stomatal conductance; survival; adaptation; biological model; climate; disaster; plant physiology; review; Adaptation, Physiological; Climate; Models, Biological; Natural Disasters; Plant Physiology; Hexapoda",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43449128081

Four putative homologs of TWCA1 are also reported and described from a search of the genomic sequence of Thalassiosira pseudonana and designated TWCATp1-4. The δ-CA class is therefore more widely distributed in marine phytoplankton than previously thought. In particular, it is not restricted to the diatoms like the cadmium-containing enzyme, CDCA, seems to be (ζ-CA class). Zinc status strongly influences growth rate in marine diatoms. We observed a decrease in the specific growth rate of T. pseudonana from 2.1 to 1.3 day-1 when the unchelated Zn concentration (Zn′) was lowered from 20 to 5 pM. In the same cultures, we detected a drop in whole-cell CA activity of about 50% in the most Zn-limited cells that occurred simultaneously with a large downregulation of TWCATp1, TWCATp2 and CDCATp gene transcripts and protein. These three genes were also found to be strongly upregulated by low pCO2 in a manner typical of many algal CA enzymes. We have also conducted field experiments in diatom-dominated natural phytoplankton assemblages sampled from Great Bay of the coast of New Jersey. We observed increased total CA activity in parallel with increased expression of homologous twca and cdca gene transcripts in water incubated at increasingly higher pH values. Immunoblot and transcript expression analyses demonstrated a clear upregulation of CDCA transcript and protein as incubation pH increased both in the lab and in the field indicating that this CA is expressed under a broad range of environmental conditions and not restricted to low pCO2 and low Zn. © Physiologia Plantarum 2007.",,"algal protein; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; sea water; zinc; amino acid sequence; animal; biology; classification; conference paper; diatom; drug effect; enzymology; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; pH; phylogeny; phytoplankton; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; United States; Western blotting; Algal Proteins; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Blotting, Western; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Anhydrases; Diatoms; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Marine Biology; Molecular Sequence Data; New Jersey; Phylogeny; Phytoplankton; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; Seawater; Zinc; algae; Bacillariophyta; Dinophyceae; Eukaryota; Haptophyceae; Nitzschia alba; Prasinophyceae; Thalassiosira pseudonana; Thalassiosira weissflogii",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42049091084

This departure is expressed numerically, as the difference between the working fluid's temperature and an ideal 'combustion temperature', calculated using a simple expression. It is shown that for combustion of hydrocarbons to be performed reversibly in a single reaction, impractically high working fluid temperatures are required - typically at least 3500 K. Chemical-looping combustion (CLC) is an alternative to traditional, single-stage combustion that performs the oxidation of fuels using two reactions, in separate vessels: the oxidizer and reducer. An additional species circulates between the oxidizer and reducer carrying oxygen atoms. Careful selection of this oxygen carrier can reduce the equilibrium temperature of the two redox reactions to below current metallurgical limits. Consequently, using CLC it is theoretically possible to approach a reversible IC engine without resorting to impractical temperatures. CLC also lends itself to carbon capture, as at no point is N2 from the air allowed to mix with the CO2 produced in the reduction process and therefore a post-combustion scrubbing plant is not required. Two thermodynamic criteria for selecting the oxygen carrier are established: the equilibrium temperature of both redox reactions should lie below present metallurgical limits. Equally, both reactions must be sufficiently hot to ensure that their reaction velocity is high. The key parameter determining the two reaction temperatures is the change in standard state entropy for each reaction. An analysis is conducted for an irreversible CLC svstern using two Rankine cycles to produce shaft work, giving an overall efficiency of 86.5 per cent. The analysis allows for irreversibilites in turbine, boiler, and condensers, but assumes reactions take place at equilibrium. However, using Rankine cycles in a CLC system is considered impractical because of the need for high-temperature, indirect heat exchange. An alternative arrangement, avoiding indirect heat exchange, is discussed briefly. © IMechE 2008.","Carbon capture and storage; Chemical-looping combustion; Efficiecy; Irreversibility; Lost work; Oxygen carrier; Rankine cycle; Zinc","Combustion; Hydrocarbons; Nonmetals; Organic compounds; Oxygen; Redox reactions; Temperature; Thermochemistry; Carbon capture; Carbon capture and storage; Chemical-looping combustion; Combustion processes; Combustion temperatures; Efficiecy; Equilibrium temperatures; IC engines; Internal combustion; Irreversibility; Lost work; Oxygen atoms; Oxygen carrier; Oxygen carriers; Poor performance; Rankine cycle; Single-stage; Working fluids; Zinc; Smoke",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48649094420

Three end points were evaluated: aqueous equilibrium PCB concentration, uptake into semipermeable membrane devices (SPMDs), and 28-day bioaccumulation in the clam Corbicula fluminea. PCB uptake by water, SPMDs, and clams followed similar trends, with reductions increasing as a function of carbon dose. Average percent reductions in clam tissue PCBs were 67, 86, and 95% for activated carbon doses of 0.7, 1.3, and 2.5% dry wt, respectively. A biodynamic model that incorporates sediment geochemistry and dietary and aqueous uptake routes was found to agree well with observed uptake by C. fluminea in our laboratory test systems. Results from this study were compared to 28-day bioaccumulation experiments involving PCB-contaminated sediment from Hunters Point Naval Shipyard (San Francisco Bay, CA) and the clam Macoma balthica. Due to differences in feeding strategy, M. balthica deposit-feeds whereas C. fluminea filter-feeds, the relative importance of the aqueous uptake route is predicted to be much higher for C. fluminea than for M. balthica. Whereas M. balthica takes up approximately 90% of its body burden through sediment ingestion, C. fluminea only accumulates approximately 45% via this route. In both cases, results strongly suggest that it is the mass transfer of PCBs from native sediment to added carbon particles, not merely reductions in aqueous PCB concentrations, that effectively reduces PCB bioavailability and uptake by sediment-dwelling organisms. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Activated carbon; Concentration (process); Sediments; Water analysis; Biodynamic model; Semipermeable membrane devices (SPMD); Polychlorinated biphenyls; activated carbon; carbon; fresh water; polychlorinated biphenyl; carbon; polychlorinated biphenyl; Activated carbon; Concentration (process); Polychlorinated biphenyls; Sediments; Water analysis; activated carbon; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; biological uptake; bivalve; experimental study; laboratory method; mass transfer; PCB; remediation; sediment chemistry; sediment pollution; aqueous solution; article; bioaccumulation; bioavailability; clam; comparative study; concentration (parameters); controlled study; Corbicula fluminea; equilibrium constant; feeding; food availability; geochemistry; macoma balthica; molecular dynamics; molecular model; nonhuman; nutrient; pollution transport; reduction; river; sediment; transport kinetics; water contamination; water transport; animal; biological model; bivalve; chemistry; metabolism; sediment; United States; water pollutant; California; Grasse River; New York [United States]; North America; San Francisco Bay; United States; Bivalvia; Corbicula fluminea; Macoma balthica; Animals; Bivalvia; Carbon; Geologic Sediments; Models, Biological; New York; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Rivers; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40949146182

Five ecoregions possess a Mediterranean climate: the Mediterranean Basin, California, central Chile, southwestern Cape in South Africa, and southwestern Australia. The originality of Mediterranean ecosystems can be explained by complex interaction between historical biogeography patterns and unique ecological processes. Insights of paleoecology and phylogeography indicate the importance of paleogeographical and paleoclimatic events in shaping this massive and original Mediterranean biodiversity and ecosystem types. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the main Mediterranean-type ecosystems (shrublands, forests, and grasslands) and of their ecological characteristics, with a balanced view concerning 'ecological convergences' notably from the point of view of species traits and community structure. Methods of phylogenetic comparative biology have indeed recently demonstrated that similarity between traits of Mediterranean woody plants could be more due to phylogenetical inertia than to common adaptive strategies under Mediterranean climates. However, these climates induce severe and contrasted stresses to ecosystems and species, which have to cope with strong temporal variation in climate and resource availability. Natural and anthropogenic disturbances also play a determinant role in ecosystem dynamics, and fire and grazing constitute in several Mediterranean ecoregions a major selective force that shapes both the evolution of life-history traits and structure and function of these ecosystems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The measurements are of turbulent nonpremixed ethylene jet flames, either undiluted or diluted with hydrogen (H2), air or nitrogen (N2). The fuel jet issues into a hot and highly diluted coflow at two O2 levels and a fixed temperature of 1100 K. These conditions emulate those of moderate or intense low oxygen dilution (MILD) combustion. Ethylene is an important species in the oxidation of higher-order hydrocarbon fuels and in the formation of soot. Under the influence of the hot and diluted coflow, soot is seen to be suppressed. At downstream locations, surrounding air is entrained which results in increases in reaction rates and a spatial mismatch between the OH and H2CO surfaces. In a very low O2 coflow, a faint outline of the reaction zone is seen to extend to the jet exit plane, whereas at a higher coflow O2 level, the flames visually appear lifted. In the flames that appear lifted, a continuous OH surface is identified that extends to the jet exit. At the ""lift-off"" height a transition from weak to strong OH is observed, analogous to a lifted flame. H2CO is also seen upstream of the transition point, providing further evidence of the occurrence of preignition reactions in the apparent lifted region of these flames. The unique characteristics of these particular cases has led to the term transitional flame. © 2007 The Combustion Institute.","Ethylene; Formaldehyde; JHC burner; MILD; OH; Rayleigh","Combustion; Ethylene; Formaldehyde; Oxidation; Turbulent flow; JHC burner; MILD; Rayleigh; Flame research; ethylene; formaldehyde; fuel; hydrocarbon; hydrogen; hydroxyl radical; nitrogen; oxygen; Combustion; Ethylene; Flame research; Formaldehyde; Oxidation; Turbulent flow; air; article; burner; combustion; device; imaging; laser; luminance; moderate or intense low oxygen dilution; oxidation; parameter; priority journal; soot; stoichiometry; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37149029693

We investigated the importance of the genetic constitution for the belowground drought response of European beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), in four populations from regions differing in precipitation (520-970 mm year-1). Saplings were grown at ample (10 vol.%; well-watered) or reduced (5 vol.%; drought treatment) soil water content in the Göttingen Rhizolab Facility for two consecutive summers, and the responses of fine root biomass, root morphology, root depth distribution, and fine root production and turnover were investigated by a combined mini-rhizotron and harvest technique approach. In the drought treatment, total root mass per plant was reduced by 30-40% as a result of: (1) a reduction in median fine root lifespan by roughly 50% and hence an increase in fine root turnover; and (2) a 10-fold reduction in relative fine root growth rate (productivity per standing root biomass). The root:shoot ratio did not increase with drought. Although beech plants originating from drier climates tended to reduce their root biomass in response to drought less than those from wetter climates, analyses of variance revealed no significant influence of genotype on root mass, morphology, growth rate or turnover. However, most fine root traits showed marked differences between the well-watered and drought treatments. We conclude that beech saplings respond to summer drought primarily by shortening root lifespan, whereas root system structure and root:shoot carbon partitioning pattern are unaltered. Beech fine root growth and turnover exhibited high phenotypic plasticity, but genotypic variation was of minor importance. In contrast, genotype had a strong influence on leaf and shoot morphogenesis and growth. © 2008 Heron Publishing.","Common garden experiment; Fagus sylvatica; Fine root longevity; Fine root turnover; Genetic variability; Mini-rhizotrons; Rhizolab; Root morphology; δ13 C signature","belowground biomass; carbon isotope; climate modeling; deciduous tree; drought stress; experimental study; fine root; genetic variation; longevity; phenotypic plasticity; precipitation intensity; root architecture; root-shoot ratio; sapling; Eurasia; Europe; North America; Fagus; Fagus sylvatica; carbon; rain; adaptation; article; beech; biomass; disaster; Europe; genetic variability; genetics; genotype; metabolism; phenotype; physiology; plant; plant root; season; temperature; Adaptation, Physiological; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Isotopes; Europe; Fagus; Genotype; Natural Disasters; Phenotype; Plant Roots; Plant Shoots; Rain; Seasons; Temperature; Variation (Genetics)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40649105553

They are thought to result from changes in net ecosystem exchange and fire incidence that are both related to drought intensity. Alterations to net ecosystem production (NEP) are caused by changes in gross primary production (GPP) and ecosystem respiration (Reco). Here, we analyse observations of the components of Reco (leaves, live and dead woody tissue, and soil) to provide first estimates of changes in Reco during short-term (seasonal to interannual) moisture limitation. Although photosynthesis declines if moisture availability is limiting, leaf dark respiration is generally maintained, potentially acclimating upwards in the longer term. If leaf area is lost, then short-term canopy-scale respiratory effluxes from wood and leaves are likely to decline. Using a moderate short-term drying scenario where soil moisture limitation leads to a loss of 0.5 m2m-2yr -1 in leaf area index, we estimate a reduction in respiratory CO 2 efflux from leaves and live woody tissue of 1.0 (±0.4) t C ha-1yr-1. Necromass decomposition declines during drought, but mortality increases; the median mortality increase following a strong El Niño is 1.1% (n=46 tropical rainforest plots) and yields an estimated net short-term increase in necromass CO2 efflux of 0.13-0.18 t C ha -1yr-1. Soil respiration is strongly sensitive to moisture limitation over the short term, but not to associated temperature increases. This effect is underestimated in many models but can lead to estimated reductions in CO2 efflux of 2.0 (±0.5) t C ha -1yr-1. Thus, the majority of short-term respiratory responses to drought point to a decline in Reco, an outcome that contradicts recent regional-scale modelling of NEP. NEP varies with both GPP and Reco but robust moisture response functions are clearly needed to improve quantification of the role of Reco in influencing regional-scale CO2 emissions from Amazonia. © 2008 The Royal Society.","Drought; Leaf; Net ecosystem exchange; Respiration; Soil; Woody tissue","carbon dioxide; drought; El Nino; fire; leaf area index; mortality; net ecosystem exchange; net ecosystem production; photosynthesis; rainforest; soil moisture; soil respiration; woody plant; Amazon Basin; South America",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41649094550

The model shows two very different responses: for CO2 concentrations of 400 ppm or lower, the system evolves into an equilibrium state. For CO2 concentrations of 440 ppm or higher, the system starts oscillating between a state with vigorous deep water formation in the Southern Ocean and a state with no deep water formation in the Southern Ocean. The flushing events result in a rapid increase in atmospheric temperatures, degassing of CO2 and therefore an increase in atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and a reduction of sea ice cover in the Southern Ocean. They also cool the deep ocean worldwide. After the flush, the deep ocean warms slowly again and CO2 is taken up by the ocean until the stratification becomes unstable again at high latitudes thousands of years later. The existence of a threshold in CO2 concentration which places the UVic ESCM in either an oscillating or non-oscillating state makes our results intriguing. If the UVic ESCM captures a mechanism that is present and important in the real climate system, the consequences would comprise a rapid increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations of several tens of ppm, an increase in global surface temperature of the order of 1-2°C, local temperature changes of the order of 6°C and a profound change in ocean stratification, deep water temperature and sea ice cover. © Springer-Verlag 2007.","Carbon cycle; Climate modelling; Global warming scenarios; Millenial-scale oscillations; Nonlinear behavior of the climate system","air temperature; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; climate oscillation; degassing; flushing; global warming; ice cover; sea ice; stratification; threshold; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849147661

We explore the potential of using the Globorotalia menardii fragmentation index (MFI) and size-normalized foraminifer shell weight (SNSW) as complementary indicators of deep-sea CaCO3 dissolution. MFI has strong correlations with bottom water [CO32-] modeled estimates of percent CaCO3 dissolved, and Mg/Ca in Pulleniatina obliquiloculata in core top samples along a depth transect on the Ontong Java Plateau (OJP) where surface ocean temperature variation is minimal. SNSW of P. obliquiloculata and Neogloboquadrina dutertrei have weak correlations with MFI-based percent dissolved, Mg/Ca in P. obliquiloculata shells and bottom water [CO32-] on the OJP. In core top samples from the eastern equatorial Pacific (EEP), SNSW of P. obliquiloculata has moderate to strong correlations with both MFI-based percent CaCO3 dissolved estimates and surface ocean environmental parameters. SNSW of N. dutertrei shells shows a latitudinal distribution in the EEP and a moderately strong correlation with MFI-based percent dissolved estimates when samples from the equatorial part of the regionare excluded. Our results suggest that there may potentially be multiple genotypes of N. dutertrei in the EEP which may be reflected in their shell weight. MFI-based percent CaCO3 dissolved estimates have no quantifiable relationship with any surface ocean environmental parameter in the EER Thus MFI acts as a reliable quantitative CaCO3 dissolution proxy insensitive to environmental biases within calcification waters of foraminifers.

A Czerny-Turner spectrograph has been optimized to measure SO2 and the oxygen collision complex (O4) in the wavelength region of 286-408 nm from an aircraft platform. The spectrograph was deployed aboard the NOAA WP-3D Orion aircraft during the New England Air Quality Study during the summer of 2004. The spectrograph has zenith and nadir field of views, allowing for measurements of pollution plumes when the aircraft is in or above the planetary boundary layer. The near-UV spectra are analyzed using the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) method to retrieve SO2 and O4 difterential slant column densities (DSCDs). The SO2 DSCDs are used to identify point source plumes and are converted to vertical column densities (VCDs), which are needed to calculate emissions of SO2 from point sources. The conversion to VCDs requires knowledge of the photon optical path length or the air mass factor (AMF). We present a novel approach to calculate the AMF using observations of the absorption of solar radiation by O4. The SO2 VCDs, wind speed and direction, and aircraft speed are then used to obtain emission fluxes from power plants. The measured SO2 power plant emission fluxes are compared to the reported emissions from the power plants. The measured and reported SO2 emission fluxes are in good agreement.

However, greenhouse-gas emissions from this sector have a significant impact on global climate, being responsible for over 3.5% of all anthropogenic radiative forcing. Also, the accrued visibility of aircraft emissions greatly affects the public image of the industry. In this context incentive-based regulations, in the form of price or quantity controls, can be envisaged as alternatives to mitigate these emissions. The use of environmental charges in air transport, and the inclusion of the sector in the European Union Emissions Trading Scheme (EU ETS), are considered under a range of scenarios. The impacts of these measures on demand are estimated, and results suggest that they are likely to be minimal - mainly due to the high willingness to pay for air transport. In particular, in the EU ETS scenario currently favoured by the EU, demand reductions are less than 2%. This may not be true in the longer run, for short trips, or if future caps become more stringent. Furthermore, given current estimates of the social Cost Of CO 2 as well as typical EU ETS prices, supply-side abatement would be too costly to be encouraged by these policies in the short term. The magnitude of aviation CO 2 emissions in the EU is estimated, both in physical and monetary terms; the results are consistent with Eurocontrol estimates and, for the EU-25, the total social cost of these emissions represents only 0.03% of the region's GDP. It is concluded that the use of multisector policies, such as the EU ETS, is unsuitable for curbing emissions from air transport, and that stringent emission charges or an isolated ETS would be better instruments. However, the inclusion of aviation in the EU ETS has advantages under target-oriented post-2012 scenarios, such as policy-costs dilution, certainty in reductions, and flexibility in abatement allocation. This solution is also attractive to airlines, as it would improve their public image but require virtually no reduction of their own emissions, as they would be fully capable of passing on policy costs to their customers. © 2007 a Pion publication printed in Great Britain.","carbon emissions; carbon permits; carbon tax; carbon trading; climate change; emissions aviation; emissions trading; EU ETS aviation; global warming; Pigouvian tax; taxes vs permits; tradable permits","abatement cost; air transportation; carbon dioxide; climate effect; economic instrument; emissions trading; European Union; global climate; global economy; greenhouse gas; incentive; radiative forcing; willingness to pay",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39649119472

Tailings disposal sites in arid and semiarid environments are especially subject to eolian dispersion and water erosion. Phytostabilization, the use of plants for in situ stabilization of tailings and metal contaminants, is a feasible alternative to costly remediation practices. In this review we emphasize considerations for phytostabilization of mine tailings in arid and semiarid environments, as well as issues impeding its long-term success. Data sources: We reviewed literature addressing mine closures and revegetation of mine tailings, along with publications evaluating plant ecology, microbial ecology, and soil properties of mine tailings. Data extraction: Data were extracted from peer-reviewed articles and books identified in Web of Science and Agricola databases, and publications available through the U.S. Department of Agriculture, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the United Nations Environment Programme. Data synthesis: Harsh climatic conditions in arid and semiarid environments along with the innate properties of mine tailings require specific considerations. Plants suitable for phytostabilization must be native, be drought-, salt-, and metal-tolerant, and should limit shoot metal accumulation. Factors for evaluating metal accumulation and toxicity issues are presented. Also reviewed are aspects of implementing phytostabilization, including plant growth stage, amendments, irrigation, and evaluation. Conclusions: Phytostabilization of mine tailings is a promising remedial technology but requires further research to identify factors affecting its long-term success by expanding knowledge of suitable plant species and mine tailings chemistry in ongoing field trials.","Arid; Mine tailings; Phytostabilization; Remediation; Revegetation; Semiarid","metal; sodium chloride; desert; drought; irrigation (agriculture); medical literature; mine tailings; nonhuman; phytoremediation; plant ecology; plant growth; plant taxonomy; priority journal; review; semiarid climate; soil amendment; soil analysis; soil treatment; vegetation; Biodegradation, Environmental; Conservation of Natural Resources; Desert Climate; Ecosystem; Environmental Pollution; Humans; Industrial Waste; Metals, Heavy; Mining; Plants; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40849137782

Reducing the sulfur content of conventional liquid fuels such as diesel or gasoline below 10 ppm, the usage of these fuels in fuel cell applications becomes increasingly promising. The first process step represents thereby the reforming, which can be carried out in different ways. One of the commonly favored gas process technologies is the steam reforming process, which is state of the art for natural gas applications. Using a proton exchange membrane (PEM) fuel cell requires a complex gas cleanup system. Using a pressurized steam reforming process offers a significant reduction of the whole system size by efficiently compressing the liquid educts. Complete PEM systems with steam reformers tend to have a higher efficiency than, for example, systems using the autothermal reforming process. Advanced diesel steam reformers for industrialization still have to be developed and improved. The Oel-Wärme-Institut gGmbH has successfully carried out research on steam reforming with variations of important parameters using a sulfur free reference fuel and desulfurized diesel. During the experiments, several parameters such as steam to carbon ratio, reformer inlet temperatures, catalysts, and fuels were varied. While running the process, a continuous product gas measurement was taken. The reformer is equipped with several thermocouples. Three of them are moveable to measure the temperature profile of the catalyst. The experiments show that product gas concentrations reach a nearly equilibrium concentration with reformer inlet temperatures >700°C of a reference fuel/steam mixture. Hydrogen concentrations over 70% were feasible. Constant inlet temperatures of = 850°C and a variation of the steam to carbon ratio only have a noticeable effect on the water gas shift equilibrium. After all experiments, carbon deposits were found in the steam reformer system and under some circumstances on the catalysts. Experiments with operating times of more than 20 h were performed at a steam to carbon ratio of 4.5. The application of continuously desulfurized diesel fuel indicates a degradation of the catalyst after a few hours. For the overall system design of PEM fuel cell applications, an operation mode at a reduced steam to carbon ratio has to be developed.

A shutdown of the AMOC leads to substantial cooling of the North Atlantic, a weak warming of the Southern Hemisphere, intensification of the northeasterly trade winds, and a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Trade wind anomalies change upwelling in the tropical oceans and hence marine productivity. Furthermore, hydrological changes associated with a southward displacement of the ITCZ lead to a reduction of terrestrial carbon stocks mainly in northern Africa and northern South America in agreement with paleoproxy data. In the freshwater perturbation experiments the ocean acts as a sink of CO2, primarily through increased solubility. The net atmospheric CO2 anomaly induced by a shutdown of the AMOC amounts to about + 15 ppmv and -10 ppmv for preindustrial and glacial conditions, respectively. This background state dependence can be explained by the fact that the glacial climate is drier and the terrestrial vegetation therefore releases a smaller amount of carbon to the atmosphere.

Evolution of snow accumulation, distribution by wind-blown snow, blowing-snow sublimation, and snow and ice surface melt were simulated by a spatially distributed, physically based, snow-evolution modelling system (SnowModel) and used as input to MIKE SHE. Discharge simulations were performed for three periods 1997-2001 (calibration period), 2001-2005 (validation period), and 2071-2100 (scenario period). The combination of SnowModel and MIKE SHE shows promising results; the timing and magnitude of simulated discharge were generally in accordance with observations (R2=0.58); however, discrepancies between simulated and observed discharge hydrographs do occur (maximum daily difference up to 44.6 m3 s-1 and up to 9% difference between observed and simulated cumulative discharge). The model does not perform well when a sudden outburst of glacial dammed water occurs, like the 2005 extreme flood event. The modelling study showed that soil processes related to yearly change in active layer depth and glacial processes (such as changes in yearly glacier area, seasonal changes in the internal glacier drainage system, and the sudden release of glacial bulk water storage) need to be determined, for example, from field studies and incorporated in the models before basin runoff can be quantified more precisely. The SnowModel and MIKE SHE model only include first-order effects of climate change. For the period 2071-2100, future IPCC A2 and B2 climate scenarios based on the HIRHAM regional climate model and HadCM3 atmosphere-ocean general circulation model simulations indicated a mean annual Zackenberg runoff about 1-5 orders of magnitude greater (around 650 mmWE year-1) than from today 1997-2005 (around 430 mmWE year-1), mainly based on changes in negative glacier net mass balance.

CO2 is known to suppress local and systemic inflammatory responses. Nonetheless, an active immune system is needed to contain bacterial contamination of the abdominal cavity. Therefore, we investigated the early and late effects of CO2 pneumoperitoneum on the ability of mice to overcome polymicrobial peritonitis. Material and Methods: Male C57/B6 mice were subjected to pneumoperitoneum with CO2 or helium, or underwent a midline laparotomy. In a first set, changes of arterial blood gases were monitored. In further experiments, polymicrobial peritonitis was induced after 1 h of pneumoperitoneum/laparotomy by cecal ligation and puncture. In a second set of experiments polymicrobial peritonitis was induced 4 h prior to exposure to pneumoperitoneum/laparotomy. After the interventions, survival rates (early survival: 6 to 48 h; late survival &gt; 48h) were monitored for 7 days. Results: There was no significant effect of pneumoperitoneum or laparotomy on arterial blood gas parameters. CO2 pneumoperitoneum significantly reduced the early (6 to 48 h) mortality of subsequent peritonitis after CO2 pneumoperitoneum compared to laparotomy (2/20 vs. 9/25; p &lt; 0.05). The protective effect did not reach significance after 7 days (late mortality). The application of a helium peritoneum did not show any beneficial effect. Application of a CO2 pneumoperitoneum during polymicrobial peritonitis significantly reduced overall mortality (p &lt; 0.05) compared to laparotomy. Conclusions: The modulation of immune responses by CO2, but not helium pneumoperitoneum, has a significant positive impact on survival during abdominal sepsis in a mouse model. Thus, application of a CO2 pneumoperitoneum may be beneficial in conditions with bacterial contamination of the abdominal cavity. © Georg Thieme Verlag KG Stuttgart.","Cecal ligation and puncture; CO2 pneumoperitoneum; Polymicrobial peritonitis; Survival","carbon dioxide; helium; carbon dioxide; helium; animal experiment; animal model; arterial gas; article; controlled study; laparotomy; male; mouse; nonhuman; peritonitis; pneumoperitoneum; sepsis; survival rate; animal; C57BL mouse; comparative study; disease model; gas; gastrointestinal radiography; infusion; laparoscopy; microbiology; peritonitis; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Disease Models, Animal; Gases; Helium; Infusions, Parenteral; Laparoscopy; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Peritonitis; Pneumoperitoneum, Artificial",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44849129236

This paper presents an alternative approach for summarizing climate change impacts on the European environment, by linking climate change scenarios to recognized environmental divisions. Sixteen climate scenarios from four general circulation models were therefore linked to 84 statistically derived strata sharing common environmental features. In this way, the future distribution of the strata, as defined by their climate characteristics, were quantified and mapped. The results show that Europe is likely to experience major environmental shifts, with pronounced regional variations. As expected, environmental strata shift northwards. In particular the southern Mediterranean strata are projected to expand, whereas Atlantic environments remain much more stable. Alpine and Mediterranean mountain environments decline dramatically. However, the Scandinavian zones show no consistent pattern of change. More detailed analysis of four sample regions shows that the impacts of the projected shifts will largely depend on regional characteristics. Environmental conservation, regional assessments and scenario development could therefore be facilitated by combining relevant regional datasets (for example for vegetation, land cover and species distribution) with the shifting environmental strata. © 2008 Foundation for Environmental Conservation.","Climate change; Climate response surfaces; Environmental stratification; Europe; Potential impacts; Regional assessment; Shifting environments","Biodiversity; Climate change; Ecosystems; Sustainable development; Environmental shifts; Environmental stratification; Environmental impact; circulation modeling; climate change; conservation; data set; ecosystem modeling; land cover; mountain environment; population distribution; vegetation; Atlantic Ocean; Eurasia; Europe; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43149094417

This two-part series (see Part II by Luhar et al. [2008. Biomass burning emissions over northern Australia constrained by aerosol measurements: II-Model validation, and impacts on air quality and radiative forcing. Atmospheric Environment, submitted for publication] seeks to address this by first formulating a scheme to determine the emissions from the Top End region of the Northern Territory during the 2004 burning season at a high temporal and spatial resolution (1 h, 1 km). The emissions are then validated using a meteorological and transport model called TAPM coupled with a variety of field measurements. The high resolution not only enables validation against various meteorological and aerosol data sets, but also allows prediction of local air quality events. Essential inputs to the emission calculations are satellite-based measurements of fire scars, yielding burnt areas, and hotspots, providing timing information on daily basis. It is shown that hotspots without associated fire scars must be taken into account in order to produce credible aerosol fields. Prediction of emissions at hourly time resolution is enabled by assigning a diurnal variation based on a McArthur fire danger meter. The total carbon emission for the 2004 season is computed to be 67.6 Tg, in remarkable agreement with the bulk estimate of 64.3 Tg derived for the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory, and comparable to the figure of 57.0 Tg determined from the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFEDv2). The total PM2.5 (particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 2.5 μm or less) emission is computed to be 0.67 Tg. The transport modelling shows that emissions leaving the study region are largely advected to the west over the Timor Sea towards the Indonesian archipelago from April to September, shifting to the south-west during October-November where they enhance the aerosol loading over Western Australia.

Using Fuzzy Kappa and other indicators, we compared forest cover estimates and spatial patterns from global and national land cover maps from the early and late 1990s, and compiled other available statistics for years before and after that period. This showed that a forest transition indeed occurred in Vietnam: The forest cover dropped to 25 - 31% of the country area in 1991 - 1993, and then increased to 32 - 37% in 1999 - 2001. The reforestation occurred at a higher rate than deforestation in the previous decades, and was due in similar proportions, to natural forest regeneration and to planted forests. The carbon stock in forests followed a similar transition, decreasing to 903 (770 - 1307)TgC in 1991 - 1993, and then increasing to 1374 (1058 - 1744)TgC in 2005. However, forest density declined during the same period, with an increasing proportion of young and degraded forests. The effects on habitats measured with landscape pattern indices were contrasted: in several regions, the reforestation decreased forest fragmentation, while in others, clearing of old-growth forests continued and/or forest fragmentation increased. This shows that a transition in forest area is not sufficient to rehabilitate the different ecosystem functions and services of forests. Other forest transitions exist in Tropical Asia and in Latin America. Knowledge about the causes, pattern and environmental impacts of the forest transition in Vietnam is therefore relevant to understand possible emerging regional trends that would have implications for global environmental change. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biodiversity; Carbon stock; Deforestation; Forest transition; Fuzzy Kappa; Habitat fragmentation; Land cover change; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Vietnam","biodiversity; carbon; deforestation; environmental change; environmental impact; forest cover; forest dynamics; habitat fragmentation; land cover; reforestation; remote sensing; Asia; Eurasia; Southeast Asia; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43349098750

For instance, we presented an example demonstrating a lateral variation in velocity that can be attributed to lateral thinning of sand bodies. Hence, using the velocity information as part of the interpretation process can lead to valuable insights in the lithologic setting. Lithological information may be extracted from simple, densely sampled, maximum coherency seismic velocity measurements using time migrated data, as illustrated by the subsurface channel clearly visible in a Dix interval velocity slice (Figs. 1 and 2). With other examples, we demonstrated a good fit between proven hydrocarbon pay and slow seismic interval velocities (Figs. 5, 7, and 8), suggesting that accurate seismic velocity measurements can be used to help evaluate the potential for pay. The velocities slow near hydrocarbon accumulations due to changes in rock properties that result from the presence of hydrocarbons, and as there is no perfect seal and the accumulation is a dynamic system over geologic time, areas near the pay zone may also display slower velocities. In Fig. 8. the depth contours did not fit the pay zone, whereas the seismic interval slow velocity fit well. All information available, such as compaction, burial history, well information, and lithology components need to be taken into account when using velocities to identify hydrocarbon bearing targets, as all slow velocity zones are not pay. We demonstrated that velocity trends are not overly sensitive to acquisition geometry (Figs. 9-11), but the information available in the velocity field can be lost by oversmoothing the data set (Fig. 12). Here, oversmoothing can result simply by using too gross an interval between velocity samples, both in time and space. As shown by the two orthogonal 3D survey velocities, the time velocities from both surveys showed similar trends, but the depth velocities used in the depth migrations for the two surveys varied. Valid information was lost in one survey's depth velocity model due to oversmoothing and coarse sampling. Because the time and depth velocity trends complement each other, both types of velocity information should be examined to ensure that transforming between domains. Another example from the Perdido fold belt, deepwater US Gulf of the structural picture when converting to depth using smooth velocities vs. finely sampled, less smoothed seismic velocities. The depth maps that incorporated finer velocity detail better fit the expected geologic structural features found in the area. In addition to impacting the imaged structures and other attributes based directly on seismic velocities, such as seismic based pore pressure estimation, undersampling and smoothing of the seismic velocity trends can lead the interpreter to miss valuable information that should be integrated into the interpretation. As the examples demonstrated, smoothing the velocity trends should be done with care, as oversmoothing can destroy useful information while undersmoothing can result in unwanted noise. The interpreter should provide guidance on the degree of smoothing to be used, including guidance on the sampling intervals. We have obtained excellent results with dense sampling, and in critical areas, we recommend velocity measurements be considered at every subsurface location. Smoothing of the data should take into account geological boundaries, loss of velocity resolution with depth, the quality of the data, maximum recorded offiet, etc. In cases where salt or salt welds separate younger synclinal basins from older basins with structure, many velocity models incorrectly force the seismic velocity to be laterally invariant across the salt boundary by extrapolating the young basin's velocity into the subsalt region. The inability to make travel time vs. angle measurements under the salt indicates that the problem needs to be addressed at the acquisition stage. If the subsalt velocity model cannot be validated by the data, this fact should be taken into account in risking the prospect and in deciding whether to commit additional reprocessing resources testing velocity models that cannot be validated by the recorded data. The interpreter should guide the smoothing based upon knowledge of the area and of the data.",,"Extrapolation; Lithology; Mathematical models; Pore pressure; Seismic prospecting; Structural geology; Velocity measurement; fold belt; hydrocarbon; lithology; rock property; seismic data; seismic migration; seismic velocity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48949117376

However, some species' flowering times have changed much more than others. Data at the community level can clarify the variation in flowering responses to climate change. In order to determine how North American species' flowering times respond to climate, we analyzed a series of previously unstudied records of the dates of first flowering for over 500 plant taxa in Concord, Massachusetts, USA. These records began with six years of observations by the famous naturalist Henry David Thoreau from 1852 to 1858, continued with 16 years of observations by the botanist Alfred Hosmer in 1878 and 1888-1902, and concluded with our own observations in 2004, 2005, and 2006. From 1852 through 2006, Concord warmed by 2.4°C due to global climate change and urbanization. Using a subset of 43 common species, we determined that plants are now flowering seven days earlier on average than they did in Thoreau's times. Plant flowering times were most correlated with mean temperatures in the one or two months just before flowering and were also correlated with January temperatures. Summer-flowering species showed more interannual variation in flowering time than did spring-flowering species, but the flowering times of spring-flowering species correlated more strongly to mean monthly temperatures. In many cases, such as within the genera Betula and Solidago, closely related, co-occurring species responded to climate very differently from one another. The differences in flowering responses to warming could affect relationships in plant communities as warming continues. Common St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) and highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum) are particularly responsive to changes in climate, are common across much of the United States, and could serve as indicators of biological responses to climate change. We discuss the need for researchers to be aware, when using data sets involving multiple observers, of how varying methodologies, sample sizes, and sampling intensities affect the results. Finally, we emphasize the importance of using historical observations, like those of Thoreau and Hosmer, as sources of long-term data and to increase public awareness of biological responses to climate change. © 2008 by the Ecological Society of America.","Climate change; Concord, Massachusetts; Flowering times; Global warming; Henry David Thoreau; Phenology","annual variation; coexistence; data set; deciduous tree; flowering; global warming; herb; phenology; urbanization; article; blueberry; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; flower; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; Hypericum; methodology; physiology; species difference; time; United States; Blueberry Plant; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Flowers; Greenhouse Effect; Hypericum; Massachusetts; Species Specificity; Time Factors; Concord; North America; North Carolina; United States; Betula; Hypericum perforatum; Solidago; Vaccinium; Vaccinium corymbosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42249090568

In the presented work, CFD is used for the development and optimisation of an innovative combustion chamber for a solid stem-shaped biofuel in the form of compressed biomass bales. The main focus of this investigation is the maximisation of the thermal output of the combustor by an optimisation of the bale burnout and the minimisation of gaseous emissions such as VOCs, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide. For this purpose the functionality of a commercial CFD-solver has been extended in terms of the solid phase description and the solid-gas interactions. These sub-routines comprise the description of the solid biomass fuel as a porous bed, the biomass drying, the degradation during devolatilisation and char burnout, as well as the generation of gaseous species and the release/consumption of energy during these three steps. Moreover a simplified model for the prediction of NOx-emissions emanating from the fuel-bound nitrogen has been implemented. The results of this work show that the application of CFD enables a significant reduction of the development costs and the time-to-market of innovative chemical engineering concepts such as solid biomass combustion. © Springer-Verlag 2008.","Biomass; CFD; Combustion; Emission reduction; NOx; Straw","Biofuels; Carbon monoxide; Computational fluid dynamics; Nitrogen oxides; Compressed biomass bales; Solid biomass combustors; Solid phase description; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43849113429

We surveyed 588 farmers longitudinally from 1993 to 2004. Questions included frequency of protective mask or respirator use in dusty conditions and the percentage of time the farmers drove a tractor with a closed cab. To assess longitudinal associations between protective behaviors and potential covariates, general estimating equation modeling was used with adjustment for subject age, study date, and other covariates. Only 25% of the farmers were ""very"" concerned about respiratory risks. Over time, any use of a dust mask or respirator decreased significantly, from 54% in 1993 to 37% in 2004 (p-value ≤ 0.0001), while consistent use of respiratory protection was maintained by 20% of the cohort. Use of a closed-cab tractor increased slightly from 14% in 1993 to 17% in 2004 (p-value = 0.04). Farmers who were ex-smokers and those concerned about respiratory risk were more likely to consistently use a dust mask or respirator. However, the more acreage or time spent in dust, the less likely farmers were to use protection. Closed-cab tractor use was associated with higher salary, more time driving tractors, and larger acreage farmed. Emission reduction remains a priority. Exposure reduction by closed-cab tractor use was not associated with perception of respiratory risk. As mask or respirator use was most positively associated with respiratory concern, more effort needs to be concentrated on educating farmers about long-term respiratory health risks, and providing more user-friendly personal protective equipment. © 2008 ASABE.","Agricultural dust; Farmer's attitudes; Longitudinal; Personal protective equipment; Protective behaviors; Respiratory disease; Respiratory risk","agriculture; article; attitude to health; chemically induced disorder; dust; female; gas mask; health behavior; high risk behavior; human; longitudinal study; male; middle aged; motor vehicle; occupational accident; occupational disease; occupational exposure; protective equipment; questionnaire; time; United States; Accidents, Occupational; Agricultural Workers' Diseases; Agriculture; Attitude to Health; California; Dust; Female; Health Behavior; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Exposure; Off-Road Motor Vehicles; Protective Devices; Questionnaires; Respiratory Protective Devices; Risk-Taking; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949229329

This study assessed the impact of no-tillage (NT) and conventional tillage (CT) systems on gaseous N losses, N2O:N2O + N2 ratios and NO3--N leaching following surface application of cattle manure. The study was undertaken during the 2003/2004 and 2004/2005 seasons at two field sites in Nova Scotia namely, Streets Ridge (SR) in Cumberland County and the Bio-environmental Engineering Centre (BEEC) in Truro. Results showed that the NT system had higher (p &lt; 0.05) NH3 losses than CT. Over the two seasons, manure incorporation in CT reduced NH3 losses on average by 86% at SR and 78% at BEEC relative to NT. At both sites and during both seasons, denitrification rates and N2O fluxes in NT were generally higher than in CT plots, presumably due to higher soil water and organic matter content in NT. Over the two seasons, mean denitrification rates at SR were 239 and 119 g N ha-1 d-1, while N2O fluxes were 120 and 64 g N ha-1 d-1 under NT and CT, respectively. At BEEC mean denitrification rates were 114 and 71 g N ha-1 d-1, while N2O fluxes were 52 and 27 g N ha-1 d-1 under NT and CT, respectively. Conversely, N2O:N2O + N2 ratios were lower in NT than CT suggesting more complete reduction of N2O to N2 under NT. When averaged across all soil depths, NO3--N was higher (p &lt; 0.05) in CT than NT. Nitrate-N decreased with depth at both sites regardless of tillage. In most cases, NO3--N was higher under CT than NT at all soil depths. Similarly, flow-weighted average NO3--N concentrations in drainage water were generally higher under CT. This may be partly attributed to higher denitrification rates under NT. Therefore, NT may be a viable strategy to remove NO3--N from the soil, and thus, reduce NO3--N contamination of groundwater. However, it should be noted that while the use of NT reduces NO3--N leaching it may come with unintended environmental tradeoffs, including increased NH3 and N2O emissions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Comparing the liquid-vapor coexistence curve, vapor pressure at coexistence, interfacial tension between the coexisting phases, etc., as obtained from both the models with the full quadrupolar interactions and the (approximate) isotropic interactions, we find discrepancies in the critical region to be typically (such as in the case of carbon dioxide) of the order of 4%.

With the city improving on air quality after implementation of environmental norms in transport and industry, there arises a need for assessment of the contribution of thermal power plants (TPPs), which are largely coal based. This study has been undertaken with an objective to assess and rank the contributors of air pollution due to ten TPP's in the National Capital Region in India installed at various times in the past and with different fuel and technology. USEPA's ISCST3 regulatory model has been used in assessment of sulphur dioxide (SOx), nitrogen dioxide (NOx) and suspended particulate matter (SPM) contribution. A comparison of the total pollution recorded vs that estimated using ISCST3 indicates the impact of pollution caused in that zone using TPPs. The overall annual contribution to the total emissions in the mega-city Delhi due to TPP's alone in the NCR for SOx and NOx are estimated as 31% and 9%, respectively. At ITO which is the most polluted site in the city, the SOx contribution ranges between 27 to 55 % and annually averages to 43% of the total. Badarpur and Indraprastha power plants rank amongst the worst due to location within the city and old technology though more recent amongst these, Dadri thermal plant quite far off from the city also influences the overall scenario. Spatial distribution is studied through concentration isopleths. Near BTPS, the maximum estimates for NOx concentration are as high as 220 to 260 μg/m3 and well above the standards thus threatening the air quality of areas, like Badarpur village, Sarita Vihar, Faridabad and parts of Noida and South Delhi. Concentration contours patterns have also been derived and analyzed. Validation of the estimated concentrations with that from the observed values is attempted through daily, monthly and seasonal trends where satisfactory patterns are obtained. With new power units planned to meet the upcoming developmental challenges, the inference from this study carried out using recent data inputs, can be put to benefit for adopting an environment friendly policy and approach. © 2008 - Kalpana Corporation.","Air quality modelling; Cumulative impact assessment; Emissions and control strategies; Thermal power plants",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949232168

Dayton St., Madison, WI 53706, United States","A laboratory incubation experiment was conducted with uranium-contaminated subsurface sediment to assess the geochemical and microbial community response to ethanol amendment. A classical sequence of terminal electron-accepting processes (TEAPs) was observed in ethanol-amended slurries, with NO 3- reduction, Fe(III) reduction, SO4 2- reduction, and CH4 production proceeding in sequence until all of the added 13C-ethanol (9 mM) was consumed. Approximately 60% of the U(VI) content of the sediment was reduced during the period of Fe(III) reduction. No additional U(VI) reduction took place during the sulfate-reducing and methanogenic phases of the experiment. Only gradual reduction of NO3-, and no reduction of U(VI), took place in ethanol-free slurries. Stimulation of additional Fe(III) or SO 42- reduction in the ethanol-amended slurries failed to promote further U(VI) reduction. Reverse transcribed 16S rRNA clone libraries revealed major increases in the abundance of organisms related to Dechloromonas, Geobacter, and Herbaspirillum in the ethanol-amended slurries. Phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) indicative of Geobacter showed a distinct increase in the amended slurries, and analysis of PLFA 13C/12C ratios confirmed the incorporation of ethanol into these PLFAs. A increase in the abundance of 13C-labeled PLFAs indicative of Desulfobacter, Desulfotomaculum, and Desulfovibrio took place during the brief period of sulfate reduction that followed the Fe(III) reduction phase. Our results show that major redox processes in ethanol-amended sediments can be reliably interpreted in terms of standard conceptual models of TEAPs in sediments. However, the redox speciation of uranium is complex and cannot be explained based on simplified thermodynamic considerations. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Actinides; Biogeochemistry; Sedimentation; Sedimentology; Transuranium elements; Uranium; Biogeochemical processes; Electron-accepting processes; Microbial communities; Subsurface sediments; Ethanol; alcohol; carbon 13; ferric ion; nitrate; ribosome RNA; sulfate; uranium; abundance; bacterium; biogeochemistry; carbon isotope; electron; ethanol; fatty acid; iron; laboratory method; methane; microbial community; nitrite; phospholipid; reduction; RNA; sediment pollution; slurry; speciation (chemistry); sulfate; thermodynamics; uranium; article; Betaproteobacteria; biogeochemistry; Dechloromonas; Desulfobacter; Desulfotomaculum; Desulfovibrio; Geobacter; Herbaspirillum; methanogenesis; microbial community; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; reduction; reverse transcription; sediment; soil pollution; thermodynamics; Biomass; Ethanol; Geologic Sediments; Radioactive Pollutants; Soil Microbiology; Soil Pollutants; Uranium; Dechloromonas; Desulfobacter; Desulfotomaculum; Desulfovibrio; Geobacter; Herbaspirillum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45249121028

These decreases have produced smaller than anticipated increases in alkalinity in surface waters in response to reductions in sulphate emissions and may have ecological consequences. This study presents annual export rates of Ca, Mg, K, and Na from 20 forested catchments between 1978 and 1998 and concentrations in seven downstream lakes between 1975 and 2005 in an acid-sensitive region of central Ontario, Canada. In contrast to monovalent cation export, decreases in divalent cation export continued after an extended dry period ended. Lake concentration trends showed three distinct periods. The first period (1975-1976 to 1982-1983) coincided with high runoff and was characterized by relatively high Ca, Mg, and K concentrations. This was followed by a 10-year period of fluctuations around the long-term mean. Concentrations then dropped below the long-term means and remained 5%-20% below the means until 2004-2005. The latter trend in lake concentrations suggests that export likely remained low but stable after May 1998 (the last month for which export data are available).

As the world's seventh largest contributor of heat trapping carbon dioxide, the region will play a critical role in moving towards stabilizing global concentrations at a level that avoids serious adverse consequences. The Northeast region is well positioned to be a leader in technology and policy innovation for reducing emissions, and can drive national and international programs that are essential to providing a safer future climate. This paper summarizes technological mitigation options and measures as well as opportunities for public and private actions to reduce emissions. The authors propose a '3% solution' of annual emission reductions to put the Northeastern United States on an emissions reductions path that is consistent with the level of reductions necessary to avoid dangerous climate change.

To improve the electrical properties of the MgO thin films, (Ba,Sr,Ca)CO3 or LaB6, which has a lower work function than that of MgO, added to the MgO films. The effects of (Ba,Sr,Ca)CO3 or LaB6 addition on the electrical properties, microstructure, and electronic band structure were investigated. In the case where (Ba,Sr,Ca) CO3 was added, the firing voltage, which is the voltage when the panel is ignited the first time during increasing input voltage, was about 18.4 V lower than that of the conventional MgO films. In the case where LaB6 was added, the firing voltage was also reduced by about 24 V. The luminance and luminous efficiency were also increased. Of particular interest was the valence band spectra changed after adding (Ba,Sr,Ca) CO3 or LaB6. The valence band edge, which is the top of the valence band, was shifted to lower binding states and the width of the valence band was increased. Moreover, the band gap was slightly reduced. Considering the emission mechanism of MgO films in plasma display panels, these results mean that the secondary electrons can be ejected more easily and the ejected electrons have more energy. Therefore, the addition of (Ba,Sr,Ca) CO3 or LaB6 might improve the electrical properties. © 2008 Materials Research Society.",,"Electric properties; Microstructure; Plasma display devices; Secondary ion mass spectrometry; Thin films; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Electronic band structure; Valence band spectra; Magnesia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39749148871

The use of renewable energies offers the opportunity to diminish energy dependence, reduce the emission of CO2 and create new employment. The involvement of local agents is highly important for the future development in this field, especially in regions whose industrial mix was based on traditional energy sources. Since this is the case in the region of Asturias (Spain), in this article we focus on the expectations of employment generated by renewable energies in Asturias during the period 2006-2010. More specifically we propose ratios of job per unit of installed energy power based on the available regional information in order to forecast energy employment in Asturias. With this aim three alternative scenarios are considered according to a range of possible future renewable energy pathways, leading to baseline, optimistic and pessimistic forecasts. Once these forecasts are computed we also analyse the emergent professional profiles and required skills related to the new jobs generated in the installation, operation and maintenance of the different renewable energy systems. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Studies of the behavior of stable isotopes in soils are being developed in two major directions: reconstruction of the environmental conditions and indication of the soil processes. Investigations into the reconstruction of the environmental conditions are based on the assumption that the isotopic composition of carbon in the soil humus is inherited from and reflects the isotopic composition of carbon in the corresponding vegetation (the source of soil humus). At the same time, studies into the indication of soil processes are based on the effects of fractionation of carbon isotopes in the course of transformation of carbon compounds. In this case, the isotopic composition of carbon in the soil humus should differ from that in the initial plant material. The analysis of available data suggests that the current state of research does not allow assessing the entire diversity of the effects of isotopic fractionation in soils. New data on the isotopic composition of carbon of soil organic matter and carbonates are being actively accumulated at present. However, it is obvious that the effect of isotopic fractionation should be taken into account in the paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic reconstructions. © MAIK Nauka 2008.",,"Carbon; Carbonates; Fractionation; Geochemistry; Isotopes; Soils; carbon isotope; isotopic composition; isotopic fractionation; soil chemistry; stable isotope",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42349088147

This paper presents national level results of applying the methodology to the entire portion of the United States in which switchgrass could be grown without irrigation. We present incremental switchgrass and coal cofiring carbon cost of mitigation curves along with a presentation of regionally specific cofiring economics and policy issues. The results show that cofiring 189 million dry short tons of switchgrass with coal in the existing U.S. coal-fired electricity generation fleet can mitigate approximately 256 million short tons of carbon-dioxide (CO2) per year, representing a 9% reduction of 2005 electricity sector CO2 emissions. Total marginal costs, including capital, labor, feedstock, and transportation, range from $20 to $86/ton CO2 mitigated, with average costs ranging from $20 to $45/ton. If some existing power plants upgrade to boilers designed for combusting switchgrass, an additional 54 million tons of switchgrass can be cofired. In this case, total marginal costs range from $26 to $100/ton CO2 mitigated, with average costs ranging from $20 to $60/ton. Costs for states east of the Mississippi River are largely unaffected by boiler replacement; Atlantic seaboard states represent the lowest cofiring cost of carbon mitigation. The central plains states west of the Mississippi River are most affected by the boiler replacement option and, in general, go from one of the lowest cofiring cost of carbon mitigation regions to the highest.

At low shear rate, the steady state shear viscosity was similar to the pure polycarbonate, whilst, at higher shear rates, three further regimes of behavior, as has been described for liquid crystals and liquid crystal polymers, were found despite the low concentration of LLC; hence, the rheological properties of the blends can be significantly modified by small concentrations of LLC (as low as 1%).

Despite the well-known advantages of recycling materials to reduce solid waste or save natural resources, the recycling stage is an additional process within the life cycle that has its own energy and input requirements, as well as specific emissions. The objective of the present paper is to analyze the life cycle inventory associated with the increase in recycling rate (from 2% up to 22% at present) of the cardboard contained in the aseptic packaging for long-life milk. The main aspects of the manufacturing of the Tetra Pak aseptic package, including the filling of the product, the distribution of the conditioned product, up to the final disposal and recycling rates, were considered. Materials and Methods. This study was conducted in accordance with the general directives of the ISO 14040 series. The packaging material system was assessed using 1000 liters of milk as a functional unit, in a packaging system containing 12 units of 1 L cartons each, placed on a corrugated paperboard tray wrapped in polyethylene shrink film and arranged onto one-way wooden pallets. Brazilian inventories for energy, carton, corrugated paperboard and aluminum, based on site-collected data were employed. The final disposal of used packages was modeled using the Average Brazilian Municipal Solid Waste Management data collected for the purpose of the census of the year 2000. Results. Comparison of the total energy consumption throughout the whole life cycle of two recycling scenarios (i.e. different recycling rates) analyzed shows that the higher recycling rate led to a 6% reduction of the total energy requirement for the long-life milk package material system. The most significant reductions in the consumption of natural resources were: 8% water, 11% wood and 10% land use savings. Greenhouse gases were the main reduced air emissions and contributed with a reduction of 9.7% in GWP. Most water emissions were reduced: 10% COD, 9% BOD and 6% TSS. A unique drawback directly caused by the increase of the recycling rate was an increase of 14.4 g in TDS emissions (57%). Discussion. The reduction in energy requirements are related and limited to the proportionality among the different materials that make up the packaging system. Most emission reductions result from the replacement of virgin materials with recycled materials in the packaging system. Although the average balance of water emissions is positive, the need to improve wastewater treatment processes in the paper recycling plants to reduce TDS is highlighted as a key issue. Conclusions. It may be concluded that the increase in the recycling rate brings about a series of benefits in terms of reduction of energy and natural resource consumption, air pollutants and most water emissions.

The influence of increased CO2 and changing climate on the carbon cycle of the terrestrial ecosystems in China is still unclear. In this article we used a process-based ecosystem model, Biome-BGC, to assess the effects of changing climate and elevated atmospheric CO2 on terrestrial China's carbon cycle during two time periods: (1) the present (1961-2000) and (2) a future with projected climate change under doubled CO2 (2071-2110). The effects of climate change alone were estimated by driving Biome-BGC with a fixed CO2 concentration and changing climate, while the CO2 fertilization effects were calculated as the difference between the results driven by both increasing CO2 and changing climate and those of variable climate alone. Model simulations indicate that during 1961-2000 at the national scale, changes in climate reduced carbon storage in China's ecosystems, but increasing CO2 compensated for these adverse effects of climate change, resulting in an overall increase in the carbon storage of China's ecosystems despite decreases in soil carbon. The interannual variability of the carbon cycle was associated with climate variations. Regional differences in climate change produced differing regional carbon uptake responses. Spatially, reductions in carbon in vegetation and soils and increases in litter carbon were primarily caused by climate change in most parts of east China, while carbon in vegetation, soils, and litter increased for much of west China. Under the future scenario (2071-2110), with a doubling CO2, China will experience higher precipitation and temperature as predicted by the Hadley Centre HadCM3 for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment. The concomitant doubling of CO2 will continue to counteract the negative effects of climate change on carbon uptake in the future, leading to an increase in carbon storage relative to current levels. This study highlights the role of CO2 fertilization in the carbon budget of China's ecosystems, although future studies should include other important processes such as land use change, human management (e.g., fertilization and irrigation), environmental pollution, etc. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.",,"annual variation; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide enrichment; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; climate variation; soil carbon; terrestrial ecosystem; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50549083975

In this work, protein-binding mechanisms of pristine and functionalized multiwalled carbon nanotubes (f-MWNTs) were investigated by varying f-MWNTs' diameters, nanotube surface chemistry, and proteins using steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence, and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies. The f-MWNTs with a larger diameter (∼40 nm) generally exhibited stronger protein binding compared to those with a smaller diameter (∼10 nm), demonstrating that the curvature of nanoparticles plays a key role in determining the protein binding affinity. Negative charges or steric properties on f-MWNTs enhanced binding for some proteins but not others, indicating that the electrostatic and stereochemical nature of both nanotubes and proteins govern nanotube/protein binding. Protein fluorescence lifetime was not altered by the binding while the intensity was quenched indicating a static quenching through complex formation.

The effect of flow rate, column diameter and column height on the removal efficiency of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons was investigated. Removal efficiency was found to correlate well with hydraulic retention time, showing that retention time is the primary parameter in the design of the adsorption column. Dissolved organic matter did not sorb onto polypropylene or polypropylene coated n-hexane, and the presence of dissolved organic matter in the aqueous phase did not significantly affect sorption of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. For experiments with polypropylene coated with n-hexane, an insignificant amount of n-hexane (less than 0.03 times the aqueous solubility of n-hexane in water) was lost due to dissolution in the effluent.

The humanitarian aid sector, as represented by United Nations agencies and NGOs, is beginning to appreciate the advantages provided by these technologies, which mostly depend on combining field-based electronic devices (GPS receiver and satellite communication modem) with a web-based application allowing all the data collected remotely to be consulted and exploited in real time. There are several applications currently in use in the field:-The World Food Programme (UNWFP): managing the aircraft that drop food consignments in order to optimise airborne missions anywhere in Africa;-The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO): no fewer then 250 agents posted across the African continent are monitoring the development of locust populations, using Inmarsat D+ terminals to send in their reports entered on state-of-the-art touch screens provided and connected by Novacom Services; by calling up crop-spraying aircraft quickly and accurately they have already saved many harvests;-The UN High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR): always in the front line, the HCR is the UN organisation most frequently confronted with the inherent dangers of regional conflicts; guaranteeing the protection of its own personnel has become a priority. For this reason, most convoys are now equipped with geolocation terminals fitted with 'SOS buttons' that can send instant distress calls, relayed by Novacom Services to field outposts as well as the HCR headquarters in Europe. Other agencies like the Red Cross (ICRC) and NGOs like Doctors Without Borders (Mèdecins Sans Frontières) are currently examining their use. The available satellite technologies, combined with peripherals such as screens or SOS buttons, provide an excellent answer to the needs of humanitarian aid professionals. However, any solution must take account of the fact that these users belong to large institutions and must also address the many different problems they face: for this purpose, Novacom Services joined forces with UNOSAT and the Fleet Forum in Geneva to promote and implement a geolocation service designed specially for players in the world of humanitarian aid. UNOSAT is a United Nations initiative launched in 2001 whose brief is to provide the agencies and member states of the United Nations with satellite-based solutions for humanitarian aid, post-crisis rehabilitation and development planning. Software management of the collected data remains the responsibility of the Novacom centre in Toulouse, while interfacing with users is the task of UNOSAT, providing the added-value of its professional experience. The Fleet Forum will provide an interface for humanitarian organisations possessing a fleet of vehicles and will publicise the service within this community. The NAV4ALL project duplicates the model that worked successfully for UNOSAT, making satellite imagery and maps available to UN agencies, particularly in the event of natural disasters. In conclusion, we found that the needs of humanitarian organisations fall into two categories: those related to the safety of personnel and those concerning vehicle fleet management. The latter issue remains a major objective for organisations that sometimes have thousands of vehicles deployed around the world. Not only can maintenance costs be reduced but also CO2 emissions, thus fully justifying the investment cost of implementing a geolocation system.",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Aircraft; Aircraft accidents; Disasters; Economics; Fasteners; Global positioning system; Human resource management; Satellite communication systems; Satellite imagery; Space applications; Touch screens; Development planning; Geolocation systems; Professional experiences; Satellite communications; Satellite technology; Software management; Web-based applications; World Food Programme; Fleet operations",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116949618

The negotiations shall not prejudice the WTO rights of any Member that is not a party to the MEA in question. (ii) Procedures for regular information exchange between MEA Secretariats and the relevant WTO committees, and the criteria for granting of observer status. (iii) The reduction or, as appropriate, elimination of tariff and non-tariff barriers to environmental goods and services. To the disappointment of many of the experts in the field, the Declaration has defined the scope of negotiation so narrowly by limiting to the relationship between WTO and MEAs (multilateral environmental agreements) only in such cases where the countries concerned are parties to both WTO and MEA. In other words, the paragraph does not cover the cases where one of the countries is not a party to a MEA, such as the United States or Australia in relation to the Kyoto Protocol on climate change. Nonetheless, it would be a great step forward if the Doha Round successfully reaches an agreement in formulating a viable scheme for the coordination between trade rules and the rules for the environment even in a limited way, since it will certainly have a favourable effect on resolving the issues, perhaps by way of analogy, among the WTO members involving non-parties to a MEA. © Cambridge University Press 2008.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84926976878

At remote and rural sites, fine particle elemental carbon, crustal elements, and coarse particle mass had pronounced (up to 20%) weekly cycles with minima on Sunday or Monday. Fine particle organic carbon and mass had smaller amplitude cycles, also with Sunday or Monday minima. There was no statistically significant weekly cycle in fine particle sulfate despite a 5 to 15% weekly cycle in power plant SO2 emissions. Although results for nitrate may be more susceptible to sampling artifacts, nitrate also showed a pronounced weekly cycle with an amplitude similar to elemental carbon. The only species found with a weekend maximum was Pb, probably from general aviation on weekends. Aerosol optical properties at NOAA monitoring sites were consistent with the IMPROVE chemical data, with significant weekly cycles in aerosol light absorption but not light scattering. These results support a large role of diesel emissions in elemental carbon aerosol over the entire United States and suggest that a large fraction of the airborne soil dust is anthropogenic. They also suggest that studies of weekly cycles in temperature, cloudiness, precipitation, or other meteorological variables should look for causes more in light-absorbing particles and possible ice nucleation by dust rather than sulfate or total aerosol.

PAHs aggregate into 20- to 50-nm particles, which extend into branched-chain structures (soots). Incomplete combustion yields black soot particles and black smoke. Many PAHs, including those in soots, fluoresce upon excitation. We have reported that butadiene soot (BDS), generated during combustion of the high-volume petrochemical 1,3-butadiene, serves as a reproducible example of combustion-derived fine and ultrafine particles, with the potential for acute or delayed health effects. Human bronchoepithelial cells (BEAS-2B) display time- and concentration- dependent responses to BDS exposure, culminating in concentration of fluorescent PAHs within discrete cytoplasmic bodies. Here we identify the cytoplasmic compartment(s) in which combustion-derived PAHs concentrate and assess the metabolic responses associated with this compartmentalization. BDS-associated fluorescence colocalized with a red fluorescent cholesterol analog and a transfected plasmid coding for a fluorescent lipid droplet surface protein within BEAS-2B cells. After BDSexposure, murine alveolar macrophages (MH-S) and adipocytes (3T3-L1) also develop fluorescence. These findings, especially within adipocytes, support the accumulation of PAHs within lipid droplets. Microarray data revealed up-regulation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor-induced Phase I biotransformation enzymes and nuclear erythroid-2 related factor 2-mediated oxidative stress responses in BEAS-2B cells. Quantitative RT-PCR results confirmed a time-dependent up-regulation of Phase I biotransformation enzymes (CYP1A1, CYP1B1, and ALDH3A1) in BDS-exposed BEAS-2B and MH-S cells. Thus, respiratory cell lipid droplets concentrate PAHs delivered by combustion-derived ultrafine particles. These PAHs, including several found in BDS and in cigarette smoke, activate xenobiotic metabolism pathways and thereby potentiate their toxicity.","Fluorescence; Lipid droplets; Polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons; Soot; Xenobiotic metabolism","1,3 butadiene; aromatic hydrocarbon; cholesterol; fat droplet; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; red fluorescent protein; 1,3 butadiene derivative; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; adipocyte; animal cell; article; bronchus mucosa; cell compartmentalization; cell viability; combustion; controlled study; epithelium cell; genetic transcription; human; human cell; lung alveolus macrophage; mouse; nonhuman; oxidative stress; protein localization; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; soot; animal; biosynthesis; bronchus; cell line; cell proliferation; cell strain 3T3; chemistry; cytology; DNA microarray; drug effect; fluorescence microscopy; gene expression regulation; genetics; lipid metabolism; metabolism; physiology; respiratory tract mucosa; signal transduction; time; Murinae; 3T3-L1 Cells; Animals; Bronchi; Butadienes; Cell Line; Cell Proliferation; Epithelial Cells; Gene Expression Regulation; Humans; Lipid Metabolism; Mice; Microscopy, Fluorescence; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Respiratory Mucosa; Signal Transduction; Soot; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42949121065

How the silique microenvironment modulates the composition and amount of storage reserves in the seeds is of interest because of the important agricultural role played by canola (B. rapa and Brassica napus) as an oilseed. Because of the small volume and dynamic nature of this microenvironment in Brassica, a standardized system was needed to study the environmental role played in storage reserve deposition. For this purpose we have developed a silique culture system that permits maturation of seed in vitro. Siliques excised from plants just 11 days after pollination complete the ripening of their seeds after 20 days of culture in light (200 μmol/m2/s) on MS medium containing 30 g/l sucrose, 0.25 mg/l BAP, and 0.025 mg/l NAA. Cytochemical localization and biochemical analyses revealed that storage reserves were affected by the in vitro maturation system. Although following a comparable ripening timeline to that occurring on the plant, and producing fully germinable seeds, in vitro maturation resulted in a 40% reduction in seed weight and the mature seeds contained decreased lipid, but increased protein, starch and soluble carbohydrates. To study the internal atmosphere surrounding the seeds, we developed a method to capture silique gases in helium with subsequent quantification of O2 and CO2 in the sample by gas chromatography. Analysis of the internal silique atmosphere showed that in vitro siliques provided seeds with a less oxygenated environment than they experience attached to the plant. Carbon dioxide concentrations remained high later into the maturation sequence in vitro than on the plant. When sampling gases from siliques attached to plants, we found multiple samples from the same plant resulted in higher variance than when only a single silique was sampled, suggesting that connection to the plant directly influences internal silique gases. Lower O2 in the in vitro siliques was correlated with depressed lipid content in their mature seeds, supporting the conclusion that oxygen availability limits lipid accumulation. Previous studies showed how environmental factors influence Brassica embryos grown in tissue culture. These systems fail to preserve the component of metabolic regulation that is enforced by the silique wall tissues. Our in vitro maturation system provides a useful tool for specialized investigations since both the gaseous and hormonal environments can be readily manipulated. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Reducing conditions were established by introducing a CO-CO2-N2 gas mixture to the reactor or by adding graphite to the molten slag prior to the experiments. As samples, two types of simulated molten slag composed of CaO-SiO2-Al2O3 mixed with PbO were used and the lead volatilization behavior was studied at 1773 K. It was found that the lead volatilization rate increased on increasing the amount of reducing agent for both graphite and the CO-CO2 gas mixture. For the CO-CO2 reducing gas mixture, this increase was mainly attributed to PbO conversion to Pb. For the addition of graphite, the increase in lead volatilization ratio was considered to partially result from PbO conversion to Pb and partially from a reaction of graphite with SiO2 yielding volatile SiO. The volatile SiO gas was then emitted from the furnace, which brought about a reduction in the SiO2 content of the slag. As a result, the slag viscosity decreased, which led to an enhancement of the lead volatilization ratio. © 2008 Springer Japan.","Heavy metals; Lead; Melting process; Molten slag; Volatilization",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42449149039

Significant changes in its capacity to do this will have direct impacts on regional climatic gradients and global atmospheric circulation. Determining the mechanisms that force long-term variation in monsoon behavior is therefore important for understanding global climate change. Competing theories vary in the degree of importance attached to glacial forcing, other orbital rhythms, and internal feedback mechanisms as primary drivers of change. There is, however, no convincing explanation as to why different proxy records from closely neighboring regions are tuned to different orbital rhythms. Here we present quantitative climatic reconstructions for the past 450 k.y. based on a long pollen record from Lake Biwa in Japan. The data suggest that continental and oceanic air mass temperatures respond predominantly to the 100 k.y. orbital rhythm, whereas the land-ocean temperature gradient and monsoon vigor oscillate mainly at the 23 k.y. insolation cycle. We suggest that the mechanisms for this behavior lie in the differential response of land and ocean to solar forcing, and conclude that the 100 k.y. signal dominates monsoon intensity only when the amplitude of solar forcing falls below a threshold level. © 2008 The Geological Society of America.","23 k.y.

In a whole area of Heliotron J vacuum vessel, a detailed 3-D mesh structure for the simulation was constructed especially for the precise investigation of particle transport in the toroidal direction. In this mesh model, a carbon target is also modeled in the simulation space, and the simulation has been carried out for the target insertion experiments in Heliotron J. Simulation results were compared with the results obtained from two-dimensional image captured with a CCD camera viewing the top surface of the carbon target. The compared results indicated that the particle source caused by the carbon target is thought to be much more localized than expected one from the Dα image around the target.

The emissions leading to these plumes can have significant temporal variability, and photochemical modeling indicates that the emissions variability can lead to increases and decreases of 10-50 ppb, or more, in ozone concentrations. Therefore, in regions with extensive industrial emissions, accounting for emission variability can be important in accurately predicting peak ozone concentrations, and in assessing the effectiveness of emission-control strategies. This work compares the changes in ozone concentrations associated with two strategies for reducing flare emissions in Houston, Texas. One strategy eliminates the highest emission flow rates, that occur relatively infrequently, and a second strategy reduces emissions that occur at a nearly constant level. When emission variability is accounted for in air quality modeling, these control scenarios are both predicted to be much more effective in reducing the expected value of daily maximum ozone concentrations than if similar reductions in the mass of emissions are made and constant emissions are assumed. The change in the expected value of daily maximum ozone concentration per ton of emissions reduced, when emissions variability is accounted for, is 5-10 times the change predicted when constant (deterministic) inventories are used. Strategies that eliminate the infrequent largest emissions are more effective at reducing the highest localized ozone concentrations than changes in nearly constant emissions. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

These cancers are often classified into 2 subtypes based on the expression of the classical estrogen receptor. In this study, we describe a new structural class of neutral tridentate 99mTc(I)-estradiol-pyridin-2-yl hydrazine derivatives for potential use in breast and endometrial cancer imaging. Methods: The 99mTc(I)-estradiol-pyridin-2-yl hydrazine derivative was synthesized via the Sonogashira cross-coupling reaction and radiolabeled via the tricarbonyl approach. Radiochemical purity was assessed by high-performance liquid chromatography. Cell-binding studies were performed with human breast adenocarcinoma MCF-7 cells. The in vivo biodistribution of the 99mTc(I) derivative was evaluated in virgin female C57BL/6 mice in defined phases of the estrous cycle. Biodistribution and SPECT/CT studies were performed with mice bearing MCF-7 and primary human endometrial tumors. Results: Radiochemical analysis demonstrated that the postpurification purity of the 99mTc(I)-estradiol-pyridin-2-yl hydrazine derivative was ≥95%, with a specific activity of 99mTc of 47.5 TBq/mmol. Cell-binding studies yielded a dissociation constant (mean ± SEM) of 11 ± 1.5 nM. In vivo studies revealed that receptor-mediated uptake was present in all phases of the estrous cycle in reproductive organs and mammary glands but was highest during the diestrous phase of the estrous cycle. Despite high nonspecific uptake in the liver, significant receptor-mediated uptake was observed in target tissues and estrogen receptor-expressing tumors (0.67% for MCF-7 tumors and 0.77% for endometrial tumors). Tumor uptake was reduced by approximately 50% on coinjection with 17β-estradiol. Conclusion:Wehave characterized a novel neutral tridentate 99mTc(I)-estradiol-pyridin- 2-yl hydrazine derivative for potential use in breast and endometrial cancer imaging. This study represents the first step on a path toward the design of estrogen-based Tc-labeled tracers with improved targeting and SPECT imaging characteristics.

Stomatal pores in the epidermis provide gates for the exchange of CO2 and water between plants and the atmosphere, processes vital to plant life. Increased [CO2] has been shown to enhance anion channel activity proposed to mediate efflux of osmoregulatory anions (Cl- and malate2-) from guard cells during stomatal closure. However, the genes encoding anion efflux channels in plant plasma membranes remain unknown. Here we report the isolation of an Arabidopsis gene, SLAC1 (SLOW ANION CHANNEL-ASSOCIATED 1, At1g12480), which mediates CO 2 sensitivity in regulation of plant gas exchange. The SLAC1 protein is a distant homologue of bacterial and fungal C4-dicarboxylate transporters, and is localized specifically to the plasma membrane of guard cells. It belongs to a protein family that in Arabidopsis consists of four structurally related members that are common in their plasma membrane localization, but show distinct tissue-specific expression patterns. The loss-of-function mutation in SLAC1 was accompanied by an over-accumulation of the osmoregulatory anions in guard cell protoplasts. Guard-cell-specific expression of SLAC1 or its family members resulted in restoration of the wild-type stomatal responses, including CO 2 sensitivity, and also in the dissipation of the over-accumulated anions. These results suggest that SLAC1-family proteins have an evolutionarily conserved function that is required for the maintenance of organic/inorganic anion homeostasis on the cellular level. ©2008 Nature Publishing Group.",,"carbon dioxide; membrane protein; protein slac1; unclassified drug; abscisic acid; anion; Arabidopsis protein; carbon dioxide; membrane protein; SLAC1 protein, Arabidopsis; agricultural production; anion; carbon dioxide; dicotyledon; gas exchange; gene expression; homeostasis; mutation; osmoregulation; protein; stomata; stomatal conductance; Arabidopsis; article; cell membrane; controlled study; gas exchange; gene isolation; gene mutation; guard cell; homeostasis; nonhuman; plant cell; priority journal; protein function; protein localization; protein structure; antibody specificity; Arabidopsis; cytology; darkness; gene expression regulation; genetics; homeostasis; ion transport; metabolism; multigene family; mutation; plant stoma; radiation exposure; Arabidopsis; Bacteria (microorganisms); Abscisic Acid; Anions; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Carbon Dioxide; Cell Membrane; Darkness; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Homeostasis; Ion Transport; Membrane Proteins; Multigene Family; Mutation; Organ Specificity; Plant Stomata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41349104941

Expanding global demands for biofuels and grains, positive feedbacks in the Amazon forest fire regime and drought may drive a faster process of forest degradation that could lead to a near-term forest dieback. Rising worldwide demands for biofuel and meat are creating powerful new incentives for agro-industrial expansion into Amazon forest regions. Forest fires, drought and logging increase susceptibility to further burning while deforestation and smoke can inhibit rainfall, exacerbating fire risk. If sea surface temperature anomalies (such as El Niño episodes) and associated Amazon droughts of the last decade continue into the future, approximately 55% of the forests of the Amazon will be cleared, logged, damaged by drought or burned over the next 20 years, emitting 15-26 Pg of carbon to the atmosphere. Several important trends could prevent a near-term dieback. As fire-sensitive investments accumulate in the landscape, property holders use less fire and invest more in fire control. Commodity markets are demanding higher environmental performance from farmers and cattle ranchers. Protected areas have been established in the pathway of expanding agricultural frontiers. Finally, emerging carbon market incentives for reductions in deforestation could support these trends. © 2008 The Royal Society.","Biofuel; Deforestation; Feedbacks; Fire; Global warming; Globalization","biofuel; clearcutting; deforestation; dieback; drought; energy market; experimental study; feedback mechanism; forest ecosystem; forest fire; global warming; globalization; incentive; land use; logging (timber); protected area; rainfall; rainforest; replacement; savanna; sea surface temperature; sensitivity analysis; smoke; twenty first century; Amazonia; South America; Bos",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41649104268

As a case study we therefore estimate the possible environmental and economic impacts of different mitigation policies (emission tax, emission cap, nitrogen tax, and livestock extensification) for typical farming systems in the German federal state of Baden-Württemberg by coupling an economic farm model with a biophysical model. This allows for an integrated analysis of the complex interactions between socioeconomic and biological systems and provides policymakers with information necessary to take responsible action. For the baseline scenario, average annual GHG emissions in Baden-Württemberg are 4.5 Mg CO2-eq ha-1 and range from 1.7 to 7.6 Mg CO2-eq ha-1. On average 38% of the emissions are from N2O (direct and indirect soil emissions, fertilizer production, and manure), 41% are from CH4 (ruminants and manure), and 21% are from CO2 (fertilizer production, gasoline, heating, and additional feed). Analysis of the farming systems shows considerably lower GHG emission from crop-producing farms (2.3-3.6 Mg CO2-eq ha-1) than from livestock-based systems (3.5-7.1 Mg CO2-eq ha-1). For the entire region, GHG emission abatement is 8-12% and income loss ranges from 2 to 10%, depending on the policy instrument. Measures taken to reduce emissions are to decrease mineral N fertilizers and produce crops at lower intensities, to reduce additional feed, and finally to reduce livestock (and concomitantly diminish manure application rates). The extent of abatement and the choice of mitigating measures depend strongly both on the policy instrument and on the farming system. Marginal abatement costs (compliance costs plus taxes) are always lowest for the emission cap and highest for the emission tax, with livestock extensification and the nitrogen tax lying in between. Therefore, the emission cap offers the best cost-benefit relation for the farmers but high additional administrative costs, which are not accounted for by the model, must be assumed. The emission tax minimizes compliance costs and should be considered the most efficient instrument at the macroeconomic scale, but again high administration costs must be added. Nitrogen tax and livestock extensification are economically less efficient, but provide greater additional environmental services (e.g. nitrate loading of aquifers, landscape preservation) and produce lower administrative costs, as information on N fertilizers and livestock is readily available from agricultural statistics. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Because older housing with lead paint constitutes the main exposure source today in the US, we quantify health benefits, costs, market value benefits, energy savings, and net economic benefits of lead-safe window replacement (which includes paint stabilization and other measures). The benefit per resident child from improved lifetime earnings alone is $21,195 in pre-1940 housing and $8685 in 1940-59 housing (in 2005 dollars). Annual energy savings are $130-486 per housing unit, with or without young resident children, with an associated increase in housing market value of $5900-14,300 per housing unit, depending on home size and number of windows replaced. Net benefits are $4490-5,629 for each housing unit built before 1940, and $491-1629 for each unit built from 1940-1959, depending on home size and number of windows replaced. Lead-safe window replacement in all pre-1960 US housing would yield net benefits of at least $67 billion, which does not include many other benefits. These other benefits, which are shown in this paper, include avoided Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, other medical costs of childhood lead exposure, avoided special education, and reduced crime and juvenile delinquency in later life.

There are two main effects that a substantial price on CO 2 emissions would have in the short run (before the generation fleet changes significantly). First consumers would react to increased price by buying less, described by their price elasticity of demand. Second, a price on CO 2 emissions would change the order in which existing generators are economically dispatched, depending on their carbon dioxide emissions and marginal fuel prices. Both the price increase and dispatch changes depend on the mix of generation technologies and fuels in the region available for dispatch, although the consumer response to higher prices is the dominant effect. We estimate that the instantaneous imposition of a price of $35 per metric ton on CO 2 emissions would lead to a 10% reduction in CO 2 emissions in PJM and MISO at a price elasticity of-0.1. Reductions in ERCOT would be about one-third as large.

Furthermore, these gases are widely accepted as standard probing gases for the characterization of the microstructure of porous solids. However, a consistent set of microstructural parameters of a microporous solid determined from the use of adsorption measurements of these different gases is not always achieved because of differences in their pore accessibility. This is a long-standing and poorly understood problem. Here, we present the calculated results of the crossing time of N2, Ar, CO2, and CH4 between two neighboring cages through a constricted window in a realistic structural model of saccharose char, generated from hybrid reverse Monte Carlo (HRMC) simulation (Nguyen, T. X.; Bhatia, S. K.; Jain, S. K.; Gubbins, K. E. Mol. Simul. 2006, 32, 567-577) using transition state theory (TST), as described in our recent work (Nguyen, T. X.; Bhatia, S. K. J. Phys. Chem. 2007, 111, 2212-2222). The striking feature in these results is that whereas very fast diffusion of carbon dioxide within the temperature range of 273-343 K, with crossing time on the molecular dynamics scale (10 -4-10-6 s), leads to instantaneous equilibrium and no hysteresis on the experimental time scale, slower diffusion of Ar and N 2 at the low temperature of analysis indicates an accessibility problem. These results rationalize the experimental results of hysteresis for N2 at 77 K and Ar at 87 K but not for CO2 at 273 K in Takeda 3 Åcarbon molecular sieves. Furthermore, it is shown that CH 4 diffusion through narrow pore mouths can be hindered even at ambient temperature. Finally, we show that the use of pore size and wall thickness distributions extracted from the adsorption of Ar at 87 K using the finite wall thickness (FWT) model (Nguyen, T. X.; Bhatia, S. K. Langmuir 2004, 20, 3532-3535 and Nguyen, T. X.; Bhatia, S. K. J. Phys. Chem.

Any such regulatory scheme should address both operational (or short-term) issues and the long-term goals of geological sequestration of CO2. In the United States many of the key operational issues, such as permitting injection wells and CO2 pipelines, are reasonably well addressed in current Federal- and State-based rules and legislation. The long-term, overarching goal of sequestration projects of decreasing the rate of increase in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 is not addressed by current regulations. We propose a hierarchical approach, in which the State/Federal government is responsible for developing regional assessments that result in broad regions of brine reservoirs being rated as ""sequestration ready"" (and designated in this paper as general permits). The burden faced by an applicant in permitting an injection site should be considerably less if the general area of the chosen site has been ranked favorably. Such a phased, hierarchical permitting process would be helpful in addressing public and stakeholder concerns related to the impact and safety of geological sequestration operations. It will also build in coordination between neighboring injection sites, where interferences are likely because of the large amount of CO2 to be injected. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This research presents the development of a multi-model approach for assessing forest growth and biomass accumulation within the wet tropics bioregion (WTB) based on 10 years of available data and existing model parameter sets. The Tropical Rainforest Growth (TRG) model system employs the 3-PG and 3-PGS models to account for both old-growth rainforest and forest regeneration from seedlings in response to human-induced and natural disturbances. Above-ground biomass (AGB) stocks of the mature forest throughout the WTB for 2000 were estimated to be ∼202 t C/ha. Replacement of areas of old-growth with commercial timber plantations decreased overall AGB stocks to approximately 146 t C/ha. However, plantation carbon accumulation rates were higher than the mature rainforest, representing their potential to accumulate more biomass over a longer analysis time period. As tropical cyclones may significantly alter the carbon stocks of old-growth rainforests, the effect of tropical cyclone Rona on the WTB was assessed. The cyclone had a minimal impact on total AGB stocks within the region, yet these systems are an important factor to be considered in carbon and forest regeneration modelling activities in the tropics. The TRG system is an advanced modelling tool providing a rapid process-based assessment of biomass stocks and accumulation dynamics within Australia's tropical rainforest bioregion and has the potential for application in tropical forest ecosystems at both national and international levels. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Numerous carbon sequestration policy initiatives, potential benefits of which in environmental, economic and social terms could be substantial, are directed toward both woodland expansion and using of wood as a substitute for fossil fuels. There is a great deal of uncertainty, however, on how to define sustainability of such policies in a broadly acceptable and efficient way; how to translate sustainability requirements into policy guidelines; how to overcome market limitations and where to place biomass production in the general context of land use where contemporary agricultural change will likely be influential. On the basis of several countries from Europe (the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Slovakia, and Ukraine) this paper highlights social and economic problems of moderating carbon emissions through afforestation. It provides an indication of whether forestry can offer a socially acceptable and a low-cost opportunity for carbon uptake. The conclusion is that along with carbon sequestration potential, the level of land use integration and the stage of institutional development play important roles for effective implementation of climate policies. The necessity is then to link these policies with regional developments, and to back them up with adequate economic incentives, appropriate institutions and with public engagement in environmental decision-making. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Here we discuss the potential impact on the chemical industry of shifting from non-renewable carbon sources to renewable carbon sources. This change to the manufacture of chemicals from biological carbon sources will provide an opportunity for the biological research community to contribute fundamental knowledge concerning carbon metabolism and its regulation. We discuss whether fundamental biological research into metabolic processes at a holistic level, made possible by completed genome sequences and integrated with detailed structural understanding of biocatalysts, can change the chemical industry from being dependent on fossil-carbon feedstocks to using biorenewable feedstocks. We illustrate this potential by discussing the prospect of building a platform technology based upon a concept of combinatorial biosynthesis, which would explore the enzymological flexibilities of polyketide biosynthesis. © 2008 The Authors.","Biochemicals; Biorenewables; Chemical feedstocks; Chemicals; Fatty acids; Platform; Polyketides","carbon; chemical industry; energy conservation; metabolism; methodology; review; Carbon; Chemical Industry; Conservation of Energy Resources",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43549122821

In addition, plants in harsh climates have been suggested to have higher levels of resource sharing than plants in milder climates. We experimentally investigated the level of resource sharing in plants from garden and forest habitats from two regions with contrasting climates. The clonal herb Aegopodium podagraria reaches its northern distribution limit in central Sweden. South of that it grows in both patchy and dynamic light climate, as a natural component of deciduous forest, as well as in more homogeneous light climates as a garden weed. Since heterogeneity and habitat harshness have both been suggested to increase resource sharing, we hypothesized (1) integration and sharing of resources to be higher in plants from forest than in plants from garden habitats and (2) integration and sharing of resources to be higher in plants from the northern region that encounter a harsher climate than in plants from the southern region. Clonal fragments of A. podagraria were collected and multiplied in the greenhouse. Ramet pairs were then planted in adjacent pots, with one ramet shaded. Rhizome connection was either left intact or severed to prevent resources sharing. Plants from forest habitats were more negatively affected by the severance treatment than plants from garden habitats. Although region alone had no significant effect on biomass, the interaction between rhizome severing, shading and regional origin was close to significance. We conclude that A. podagraria from forests are more dependent on resource sharing than those from gardens. These results concur with previous studies that suggest that local adaptation for different degrees of resource sharing can occur in clonal plants. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Aegopodium podagraria; Clonal plant; Local adaptation; Physiological integration; Resource sharing","clonal organism; deciduous forest; growth; habitat; herb; heterogeneity; local adaptation; physiology; survival; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden; Aegopodium podagraria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549135108

The overall objective is to demonstrate SEA as a systematic and structured policy, plan, and program (PPP) decision support tool. In order to accomplish this objective, a stakeholder-based SEA application to greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation policy options in Canadian agriculture is presented. Using a mail-out impact assessment exercise, agricultural producers and nonproducers from across the Canadian prairie region were asked to evaluate five competing GHG mitigation options against 13 valued environmental components (VECs). Data were analyzed using multi-criteria and exploratory analytical techniques. The results suggest considerable variation in perceived impacts and GHG mitigation policy preferences, suggesting that a blanket policy approach to GHG mitigation will create gainers and losers based on soil type and associate cropping and on-farm management practices. It is possible to identify a series of regional greenhouse gas mitigation programs that are robust, socially meaningful, and operationally relevant to both agricultural producers and policy decision makers. The assessment demonstrates the ability of SEA to address, in an operational sense, environmental problems that are characterized by conflicting interests and competing objectives and alternatives. A structured and systematic SEA methodology provides the necessary decision support framework for the consideration of impacts, and allows for PPPs to be assessed based on a much broader set of properties, objectives, criteria, and constraints whereas maintaining rigor and accountability in the assessment process. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Agriculture; Canada; Greenhouse gas mitigation options; Multi-criteria evaluation; Strategic environmental assessment","Greenhouse gas mitigation options; Strategic environmental assessment; Structured policy; Agriculture; Decision support systems; Environmental impact; Public policy; Soils; Greenhouse gases; agri-environmental policy; agricultural land; data set; decision making; greenhouse gas; management practice; prairie; stakeholder; strategic environmental assessment; agricultural procedures; agriculture; article; Canada; cropping system; decision making; decision support system; environmental impact assessment; environmental monitoring; greenhouse gas; methodology; policy; soil; Agriculture; Air Pollutants; Canada; Conservation of Natural Resources; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Risk Assessment; Risk Management; Software; Canada; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37549048596

In addition to vasodilatation and bradycardia, hyperventilation precedes loss of consciousness. The resultant hypocapnia causes cerebral vasoconstriction and peripheral vasodilatation. We postulate that more pronounced cerebral and peripheral vascular responses to reductions in arterial CO2 levels underlie greater susceptibility to neurally mediated syncope. Methods: We compared vascular responses to CO2 among 31 patients with histories of recurrent neurally mediated syncope and low orthostatic tolerance and 14 age- and sex-matched control subjects with no history of syncope and normal orthostatic tolerance. Vascular responses to CO2 were calculated after all subjects had fully recovered and their blood pressures and heart rates were stable. We measured blood flow velocity in the middle cerebral artery (transcranial Doppler) and in the left brachial artery (brachial Doppler), and end-tidal CO2 during voluntary hyperventilation and hypoventilation (end-tidal CO2 from 21-45mm Hg), and determined the slopes of the relations. Results: Hypocapnia produced a significantly greater reduction in cerebral blood flow velocity and in forearm vascular resistance in patients with neurally mediated syncope than in control subjects. Opposite changes occurred in response to hypercapnia. In all subjects, the changes in cerebral blood flow velocity and forearm vasodilatation were inversely related with orthostatic tolerance. Interpretation: Susceptibility to neurally mediated syncope can be explained, at least in part, by enhanced cerebral vasoconstriction and peripheral vasodilatation in response to hypocapnia.

Contrasting simulations are driven either by repeated mean climatology or raw climate data with interannual variability included. Interannual climate variability reduces net global vegetation cover, particularly over semi-arid regions, and favors the expansion of grass cover at the expense of tree cover, due to differences in growth rates, fire impacts, and interception. The area burnt by global fires is substantially enhanced by interannual precipitation variability. The current position of the central United States' ecotone, with forests to the east and grasslands to the west, is largely attributed to climate variability.

A statistical analysis of soil moisture feedbacks on boreal and austral summer precipitation is performed using output from 19 climate models in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's Fourth Assessment Report. The methodology, using lagged covariance ratios, was previously applied to study ocean-atmosphere and vegetation-atmosphere interactions. Reflecting ensemble-based findings from the Global Land-Atmosphere Coupling Experiment (GLACE) for boreal summer, positive soil moisture feedback hot spots are identified over central United States, North Africa, India, northern Brazil, and western Eurasia. Hot spots for austral summer include the Amazon, Congo, Australia, Indonesia, Mexico, and southwest United States. This statistical approach focuses on appropriate spatial and temporal scales of interaction, quantifies local feedbacks with significance testing, and expedites a reliable model intercomparison of feedbacks, without producing additional dynamical experiments.

The KlHEM1 promoter, fused to the reporter lacZ gene, has been analysed by deletion and direct mutagenesis techniques in order to find regulatory elements functionally relevant in this transcriptional regulation. Two regulatory regions which contain the consensuses for KlGcr1p and KlMig1p binding are functional in the promoter. Regulation by carbon source is oppositely dependent on KlGcr1p and KlMig1p, as also confirmed by the use of mutants in these regulatory factors. A pyrimidine-rich element is necessary for full expression of KlHEM1 both in aerobic and hypoxic conditions. Deletion analyses show that a regulatory sequence included in the region - 656 to - 558 is also necessary to reach high KlHEM1 expression in hypoxia. Hypoxic expression and repression caused in this condition by externally added deuteroporphyrin IX is independent of the consensuses for KlHap1p and KlBuf1p binding. Effects caused by disruption of the genes coding for the regulatory factors KlHap1p, KlRox1p and KlMot3p on KlHEM1 aerobic transcription do not fully explain the differences observed between normoxic and hypoxic expression. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Macroscopically the intraclastic rocks display graded bedding and are typified by a matrix-supported fabric with subangular to subrounded particles less than a millimetre to ∼1.5 × 0.5 cm. Both clasts and matrix consist mainly of varying proportions of microcrystalline and microconcretionary carbonates, quartz, muscovite and subordinate pyrite. Within individual intraclasts, carbonate minerals (including distinctly zoned microconcretions) are essentially Mg kutnahorite and Mg-Ca rhodochrosite, similar to the carbonate minerals in the manganesestone. Whole rock chemistry of the intraclastic carbonates shows significant variability in the amounts of SiO2, Al2O3, MnO, MgO, CaO, Na2O and, to a lesser extent, K2O. Major element contents of the manganesestone similarly vary widely, except that these have, in particular, comparably higher MnO but less SiO2 and Al2O3 than the intraclastic carbonates and host rock Mn phyllite. Rare earth element (REE) concentrations in the intraclastic carbonates are approximately an order of magnitude higher than in the manganesestone. Whereas both rocks exhibit positive Eu anomalies, only the manganesestone shows a discernibly negative Ce anomaly. Petrographic and geochemical features suggest that the intraclasts are fragments of reworked Mn carbonate sediments derived from intraformational erosion and subsequent (mass flow) deposition as carbonate ""turbidite"" mud. Processes such as submarine slumping, sliding and other sediment gravity flows may have likely interrupted Mn sedimentation and transported partially consolidated manganiferous sediments down slopes into the early Birimian ocean. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

It traces the development of the UK Emissions Trading Group and links the group's preferences for emission trading to socio-economic, operational and legislative contexts. The analysis reveals that, although business originally supported emission trading as an alternative to taxation, more socio-symbolic motives shaped business interest in emission trading after announcement of the Climate Change Levy. This suggests that 'symbolic politics' can drive industry support for economic instruments such as emission trading, even when the economic rationale for doing so is diminished or constrained by existing policy frameworks or wider socio-economic contexts.

One liquid fraction rich in nitrogen is used as a biofertiliser locally on the farm and the other liquid fraction with a low nutrient concentration is used for irrigation on the farm. In this study, ammonia volatilisation following landspreading of the liquid biofertiliser was investigated. Three application techniques were compared: a disc coulter injector, a spoke wheel injector and a newly developed high-pressure injector using a trailing shoe technique. Two field studies using the micrometeorological mass-balance technique and a laboratory study employing a dynamic chamber technique showed that when the liquid biofertiliser was surface applied, 20-35% of the applied total ammonical nitrogen (TAN) was lost as ammonia, whereas disc coulter injection into 5-7 cm depth reduced the loss to 2-3% of TAN. In the laboratory study, it was seen that the high-pressure injection reduced the ammonia volatilisation as much as disc coulter injection into 5-7 cm depth, but in the field experiment the high-pressure technique was not able to inject deeper than 0-2 cm, thereby it had no reducing effect on ammonia volatilisation compared to surface application. A yield experiment showed significantly higher yields from spoke wheel injection and high-pressure injection of biofertiliser compared to surface application, but significantly reduced yields compared to commercial mineral fertilisers. © 2008 IAgrE.",,"Concentration (process); Crops; Cultivation; Fertilizers; Nutrients; Particulate emissions; Liquid fraction; Volatile liquid fertilizers; Ammonia; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43649092736

Box 219, Reading, RG6 6AH, United Kingdom","This paper examines the life cycle GHG emissions from existing UK pulverized coal power plants. The life cycle of the electricity generation plant includes construction, operation and decommissioning. The operation phase is extended to upstream and downstream processes. Upstream processes include the mining and transport of coal including methane leakage and the production and transport of limestone and ammonia, which are necessary for flue gas clean up. Downstream processes, on the other hand, include waste disposal and the recovery of land used for surface mining. The methodology used is material based process analysis that allows calculation of the total emissions for each process involved. A simple model for predicting the energy and material requirements of the power plant is developed. Preliminary calculations reveal that for a typical UK coal fired plant, the life cycle emissions amount to 990 g CO2-e/kWh of electricity generated, which compares well with previous UK studies. The majority of these emissions result from direct fuel combustion (882 g/kWh, 89%) with methane leakage from mining operations accounting for 60% of indirect emissions. In total, mining operations (including methane leakage) account for 67.4% of indirect emissions, while limestone and other material production and transport account for 31.5%. The methodology developed is also applied to a typical IGCC power plant. It is found that IGCC life cycle emissions are 15% less than those from PC power plants. Furthermore, upon investigating the influence of power plant parameters on life cycle emissions, it is determined that, while the effect of changing the load factor is negligible, increasing efficiency from 35% to 38% can reduce emissions by 7.6%. The current study is funded by the UK National Environment Research Council (NERC) and is undertaken as part of the UK Carbon Capture and Storage Consortium (UKCCSC). Future work will investigate the life cycle emissions from other power generation technologies with and without carbon capture and storage. The current paper reveals that it might be possible that, when CCS is employed, the emissions during generation decrease to a level where the emissions from upstream processes (i.e. coal production and transport) become dominant, and so, the life cycle efficiency of the CCS system can be significantly reduced. The location of coal, coal composition and mining method are important in determining the overall impacts. In addition to studying the net emissions from CCS systems, future work will also investigate the feasibility and technoeconomics of these systems as a means of carbon abatement. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The 2H Zeeman relaxation rate is strongly increased near the transition temperature. By calculating the noncritical contribution to the Zeeman relaxation rate, we show that the observed relaxation rate clearly presents a pseudo-divergent behavior near Tc, with a logarithmic singularity.

It was shown that centennial (c. 100 year), tri-decadal (27-32 year), bi-decadal (17-23 year) and decadal (9-13 year) periodicities governed the climate variability in Finland over the last five centuries. Despite the fact that many of the climatic periodicities bore great resemblance to periodicities of solar cycles, little evidence of actual solar influence on Finnish climate was found when the climate proxy records were subjected to linear correlation analysis with sunspot numbers. Highly non-linear response of Northern Fennoscandian climate to solar forcing might be a cause of this result, as well as influence of terrestrial climatic processes (e.g. effect of other forcing factors and internal dynamics of regional climate). Our results show that the presence of internal climate variability at time-scales of solar activity might distort the solar signature in climatic data and complicate its detection. © 2008 Swedish Society for Anthropology and Geography.","Climatology; Meteorology; Palaeoclimatology; Solar activity; Tree-rings","climate oscillation; climate variation; correlation; data set; dendrochronology; paleoclimate; proxy climate record; solar activity; statistical analysis; tree ring; Eurasia; Europe; Finland; Northern Europe; Scandinavia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44849115309

Etching was carried out on samples plastically deformed and then heated to 550 °C for a certain period of time. The plastic deformation zone was clearly seen in the low carbon steel (∼0.15%C), whereas it was mainly opaque in the medium carbon steel (0.25-0.35%C) and could not be seen in the high carbon steel (0.55%C). In the case of low carbon steels, severe chemical reaction occurred in the undeformed ferrite grains, while there was a weak reaction in the deformed ferrite. The plastic zone was detectable from the different surface states. Such a change in etching response in the above carbon steels was found to be related to their microstructural morphology (ferrite/pearlite), and a large amount of ferrite grain in the sample, i.e. the low carbon steels, was more suitable for revealing the plastic zone. This was due to the change in microstructure: (i) many tiny cementite particles (Fe3C) are precipitated in the deformed ferrite matrix during heating process, and (ii) finer ferrite grains are produced in the plastic zone. Because the main reason for observation of the plastic zone is related to the change in microstructure in the ferrite matrix, the material having a large amount of pearlite (high carbon steel) did not show the plastic deformation zone. Based upon the change of microstructure in ferrite, details of the etching mechanism for identification of the plastic zone are discussed. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Simulation of the energy, water and CO2 fluxes in Mixfor-SVAT is based on aggregated description of the physical and biological processes on the leaf, tree (plant) and stand levels that allows to apply this model for prediction of atmospheric fluxes for the different vegetation types from grasslands and agricultural crops to vertically structured mono-specific and mixed forest stands represented by one or by many different tree species, as well as for description of the flux partitioning among different canopy sub-layers and different tree species. Upper boundary conditions of the model are measured or predicted meteorological parameters (air temperature and humidity, wind speed, CO2 concentration, precipitation rate and global radiation) at some height above a plant canopy within the atmospheric surface layer. For simulation of exchange processes within a multi-specific forest stand Mixfor-SVAT uses both averaged and species specific biophysical parameters of the trees describing their structure (e.g. height, crown shape, stem diameter, root depth) and biological properties (e.g. leaf stomatal conductance, photosynthesis and respiration rates, etc.). Mixfor-SVAT assumes that trees of the different species are evenly distributed over some homogeneous ground surface area and that there are no differences in biophysical properties between the same tree species. Mixfor-SVAT was applied to a natural tropical rainforest in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia. The modelled H2O and CO2 fluxes were compared with results of eddy covariance flux measurements above the forest canopy for the period from October 2003 to February 2005. All necessary biophysical parameters of vegetation and soil were obtained during several intensive field campaigns in 2004-2006. Comparisons showed a good agreement between modelled and measured H2O and CO2 fluxes especially for smoothed daily flux trends. However, a large number of spikes in measured data series caused by some instrumental errors, sensor wetting, changes in the footprint or fast changes in turbulence conditions resulted in some reduction of correlation between modeled and measured fluxes (e.g. r2 = 0.62 for CO2 and r2 = 0.64 for H2O fluxes under friction velocity u* &gt; 0.3 m s-1). The developed Mixfor-SVAT model could be applied for solutions of the different theoretical and applied tasks, e.g. to describe the response of H2O and CO2 budgets of the different forest ecosystems to environmental and land use changes in different time scales, or to recover the long-term records of H2O and CO2 fluxes in the cases of data loss or not reliable measured fluxes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The advantage of this approach is that the emission factors represent integrated emissions from several vehicle types and different types of wood stoves. Normally it is very difficult to estimate the total emissions in cities on the basis of laboratory measurements on single vehicles or stoves because of the large variability in conditions. The measurements were made in Temuco, Chile, between April 18 and June 15, 2005 at two sites. The first one was located in a residential area relatively far from major roads. The second site was located in a busy street in downtown Temuco where wood consumption is low. The measurements support the assumption that the monitoring sites represent the impact of different emission sources, namely traffic and residential wood combustion (RWC). Fitting model results to the available measurements, emission factors were obtained for PM10 (RWC = 2160 ± 100 mg/kg; traffic = 610 ± 51 mg/veh-km), NOx (RWC = 800 ± 100 mg/kg; traffic = 4400 ± 100 mg/veh-km), BC (RWC = 74 ± 6 mg/kg; traffic = 60 ± 3 mg/veh-km) and particle number (N) with size distribution between 25 and 600 nm (N25-600) (RWC = 8.9 ± 1 × 1014 pt/kg; traffic = 67 ± 0.5 × 1014 pt/veh-km). The obtained emission factors are comparable to results reported in the literature. The size distribution of the N emission factors for traffic was shown to be different than for RWC. The main difference is that although traffic emissions show a bimodal size distribution with a main mode below 30 nm and a secondary one around 100 nm, RWC emissions show the main mode slightly below 100 nm and a smaller nucleation mode below 50 nm.

The technology is well established in North America and parts of Europe, but is at the demonstration stage in the United Kingdom. This paper presents the idea of using ground as a heat source for a heat pump in a small-scale application. The main characteristic features of a heat source for a heat pump are analysed. Some fundamentals of underground thermal energy storage (UTES) are presented. Different options of UTES: boreholes in rocks, ducts and coils in earth, and aquifers are analysed. Different types of heat, i.e., solar energy, waste heat, surplus of heat from co-generation power plants, recovered heat from air conditioning systems, can be stored in the ground in summer and used for heating purposes in winter time. Low and high temperature thermal energy storage is mentioned. Low temperature ground storage must be coupled with a heat pump to meet heating requirements. Present state and prospects for UTES and ground source heat pumps applications are presented. A vertical borehole used as heat source for a GSHP can be recharged by means of an exhaust-air heat-recovery coil and thus increase the brine temperature by 3-4oK. This raises the capacity of the heat pump and may also raise the COP. To raise the COP, however, the heating system must be complemented with more heat transfer area and/or a buffer tank. A buffer tank is recommended to avoid high starting frequencies in 'mini' hydronic heating systems used to retrofit houses with direct-acting electric heaters. Pressure drops in the recharging coil as well as pump and fan motor efficiencies must also be carefully considered to actually improve on the overall COP. Adding a supply-air coil may provide 'free' cooling and gives an opportunity for a highly efficient heat-recovery system with no need for defrosting. The exhaust-air coil is a better way of recharging a borehole than is the solar system alternative. Most cost-effective, however, is choosing a deeper borehole from the very beginning. The air heat pumps cannot match the lower cost of operating typical electric/gas equipment. The ground source equipment can operate with lower cost that the electric/gas equipment. The variable-speed heat pump would seem to be the least desirable unit for a utility to advocate since it reduces energy but increases summer demand and has little impact on reducing winter demand. The GSHP reduces demand and energy. It would appear to be a logical unit to rebate for a winter or summer peaking utility. Energy savings are sufficient enough to warrant added investments in the $600 to $900/ton range, especially if costs can be assumed in a 15 or 30-year mortgage. © 2008 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

To examine whether the CO2 laser radiation on the dorsum of the hand selectively stimulates Aδ-fibers, laser evoked potentials (LEP) were recorded. The mean peak latency of LEP was 381.4 ms. The findings revealed that the CO2 laser selectively stimulated Aδ-fibers. Electrical tooth stimuli with 3 levels of intensities (1.2, 1.4, 1.6 times the pain threshold) were applied to subjects as test stimulation in randomized order, with a CO2 laser stimulus of 18 mJ/mm2 applied to the dorsum of the hand for 4 min as the noxious conditioning stimulus. Somatosensory evoked potentials (SEP) induced by electrical tooth stimulation were recorded and tooth pain intensity was evaluated using a visual analogue scale (VAS). The amplitudes of the SEP late component and VAS values were significantly decreased only during the conditioning stimuli without aftereffect. The inhibitory rates of the amplitudes ranged from 31.3% to 34.6% and the VAS values from 29.0% to 31.2%. There were no significant differences in their inhibitory rates between the 3 test stimulus intensities. The result indicated that selective Aδ-fiber stimulation with the CO2 laser produces a DNIC effect in the trigeminal nerve territory and suggested that the DNIC effect does not depend on the intensity of the test stimuli. © 2007 International Association for the Study of Pain.","Aδ-fiber; Diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC) effect; Electrical tooth stimulation; Laser conditioning stimulation; Somatosensory evoked potentials; Test stimulus intensities","carbon dioxide; adult; article; carbon dioxide laser; controlled study; delta nerve fiber; evoked somatosensory response; female; human; human experiment; male; nerve conduction; nociceptive stimulation; normal human; pain threshold; priority journal; trigeminal nerve; Adult; Carbon Dioxide; Electric Stimulation; Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory; Female; Humans; Lasers; Male; Neural Inhibition; Physical Stimulation; Tooth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43649086367

Relatively few groups of microorganisms consume methane in subsurface environments - namely the anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME clades 1, 2 and 3), which are phylogenetically related to methanogenic archaea. Anaerobic oxidation of methane presumably proceeds via a 'reversed' methanogenic pathway. The ANME are generally associated with sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) and sulfate is the only documented final electron acceptor for AOM in marine sediments. Our comparative study explored the coupling of AOM with sulfate reduction (SR) and methane generation (MOG) in microbial communities from Gulf of Mexico cold seep sediments that were naturally enriched with methane and other hydrocarbons. These sediments harbour a variety of ANME clades and SRB. Following enrichment under an atmosphere of methane, AOM fuelled 50-100% of SR, even in sediment slurries containing petroleum-associated hydrocarbons and organic matter. In the presence of methane and sulfate, the investigated microbial communities produce methane at a small fraction (∼10%) of the AOM rate. Anaerobic oxidation of methane, MOG and SR rates decreased significantly with decreasing concentration of methane, and in the presence of the SR inhibitor molybdate, but reacted differently to the MOG inhibitor 2-bromoethanesulfonate (BES). The addition of acetate, a possible breakdown product of petroleum in situ and a potential intermediate in AOM/SR syntrophy, did not suppress AOM activity; rather acetate stimulated microbial activity in oily sediment slurries. © 2008 The Authors.",,"archaeal DNA; bacterial DNA; methane; RNA 16S; sea water; sulfate; anaerobic growth; article; biosynthesis; classification; cold; Deltaproteobacteria; DNA sequence; ecosystem; Euryarchaeota; fluorescence in situ hybridization; genetics; Gram negative anaerobic bacteria; growth, development and aging; metabolism; Mexico; microbiology; oxidation reduction reaction; sediment; Anaerobiosis; Cold; Deltaproteobacteria; DNA, Archaeal; DNA, Bacterial; Ecosystem; Euryarchaeota; Geologic Sediments; In Situ Hybridization, Fluorescence; Methane; Mexico; Oxidation-Reduction; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Seawater; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Sulfates; Sulfur-Reducing Bacteria; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41849084119

Process simulations of advanced plants fed by biomass are a key step to develop renewable resources based high temperature fuel cell applications. The aim of this work is to predict the component behavior of a specific power plant mainly composed of a gasifier, a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC), and a micro-gas-turbine (mGT) and fed by chestnut coppice, waste available in great quantity in Central Italy, as well as in several other European regions. The gasifier produces a gas with a high content of hydrogen and low content of char and tar. This syngas is exploited by the MCFC-mGT plant. The mGT using the MCFC cathode outlet gases, shows through simulation to be able to operate the air compressor and produce further electrical power Particular models for the MCFC and gasifier have been developed in FORTRAN by the authors and then interfaced to commercial software (CHEMCAD©) to simulate the plant's thermodynamic behavior. The results show the possibility of an extremely interesting ""carbon neutral"" plant configuration with high electrical and global efficiency (respectively, 41% and 86%), exclusively based on the use of renewable resources (biomass).

Its simulations are constrained only by the parameters of a linear regression line for a characteristic climatological variable. Simulated series are generated by resampling from segments of observation series such that the resulting series comply with the prescribed regression parameters and possess realistic annual cycles and persistence. The resampling guarantees that the simulated series are physically consistent both with respect to the combinations of different meteorological variables and to their spatial distribution at each time step. The resampling approach is evaluated by means of a cross validation experiment for the Elbe river basin: Its simulations are compared both to an observed climatology and to data simulated by a dynamical RCM. This cross validation shows that the approach is able to reproduce the observed climatology with respect to statistics such as long-term means, persistence features (e.g., dry spells) and extreme events. The agreement of its simulations with the observational data is much closer than for the RCM data. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,"climate modeling; climatology; model validation; performance assessment; regional climate; regression analysis; sampling; spatial distribution; Central Europe; Elbe Basin; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43449132401

This article reviews some of the approaches for addressing the expected effects that climate change may likely inflict on wheat in some of the most important wheat growing areas, namely germplasm adaptation, system management, and mitigation. Future climate scenarios suggest that global warming may be beneficial for the wheat crop in some regions, but could reduce productivity in zones where optimal temperatures already exist. For example, by 2050, as a result of possible climate shifts in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGPs) - currently part of the favorable, high potential, irrigated, low rainfall mega-environment, which accounts for 15% of global wheat production - as much as 51% of its area might be reclassified as a heat-stressed, irrigated, short-season production mega-environment. This shift would also represent a significant reduction in wheat yields, unless appropriate cultivars and crop management practices were offered to and adopted by South Asian farmers. Under the same climate scenarios, the area covered by the cool, temperate wheat mega-environment could expand as far as 65°N in both North America and Eurasia. To adapt and mitigate the climate change effects on wheat supplies for the poor, germplasm scientists and agronomists are developing heat-tolerant wheat germplasm, as well as cultivars better adapted to conservation agriculture. Encouraging results include identifying sources of alleles for heat tolerance and their introgression into breeding populations through conventional methods and biotechnology. Likewise, agronomists and extension agents are aiming to cut CO2 emissions by reducing tillage and the burning of crop residues. Mitigation research promises to reduce emissions of nitrous oxide by using infrared sensors and the normalized differential vegetative index (NDVI) that determines the right times and correct amounts of fertilizer to apply. Wheat geneticists and physiologists are also assessing wild relatives of wheat as potential sources of genes with inhibitory effects on soil nitrification. Through the existing global and regional research-for-development networks featuring wheat, technology and knowledge can flow to allow farmers to face the risks associated with climate change. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The former causes subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), and the latter causes intracerebral or intraventricular hemorrhage. Case description: In this report, we describe the case of a 34-year-old woman with moyamoya disease who suddenly developed headache and jacksonian seizure. Plain computed tomographic scans on admission revealed SAH localized over the left frontal cortex. The patient was diagnosed with moyamoya disease on cerebral angiography. However, no aneurysm was found on cerebral angiography. Positron emission tomography showed the reduction of CBF and its reactivity to acetazolamide and the elevation of CBV in the left hemisphere. She underwent STA to MCA anastomosis and indirect synangiosis. Intraoperative observations revealed that the pial arterioles were markedly dilated on the brain surface. The CBF in the left hemisphere significantly improved after surgery. The patient has experienced no further episode of cerebral ischemia or intracranial bleeding. Conclusions: Subarachnoid hemorrhage of unknown cause is quite rare in moyamoya disease. Based on the findings in the present case, the dilated collateral arteries on the brain surface may rupture and cause SAH over the cerebral cortex, which is the third cause of intracranial bleeding in patients with persistent cerebral ischemia due to moyamoya disease. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

This paper emphasizes our limited understanding of the carbohydrate economy of CAM in relation to growth processes and briefly reviews recent studies of the diel cycles of growth in these plants. An inadvertent long-term, regional-scale experiment from the past is revisited in which an Opuntia monoculture grew to occupy &gt;25 million hectares of farmland in central eastern Australia, producing a total biomass of about 1.5 billion tonnes in about 80 years. Although at the time it does not seem to have been recognized that this invasion involved CAM, a botanist from the University of Melbourne, Jean White-Haney emerges as a heroic pioneer in the control of the invader by poison and pioneered its biological control. The Opuntia population was expanding at 10-100 ha h-1 when it was brought to a halt within a decade by the voracious appetite of Cactoblastis cactorum larvae. It is now known that the female parent moth of this predator detects CAM in O. stricta prior to oviposition by deploying the most sensitive CO2 detector system yet found in the Lepidoptera. The O. stricta invasion is a dramatic demonstration of the capacity of CAM plants to attain and sustain high biomass; to sequester and retain atmospheric CO2. In conclusion, experiments are reviewed that show stimulation of CO2 assimilation, growth, and biomass of CAM plants by elevated atmospheric [CO2], and the proposition that these plants may have a role in atmospheric CO2 sequestration is re-examined. This role may be compromised by predators such as Cactoblastis. However the moth CO2 sensors are adapted to pre-industrial atmospheric [CO2] and FACE (free-air CO2 enrichment) experiments show this exquisite system of biological control is also compromised by rising global [CO2] in the Anthropocene. © The Author [2008].

The article concludes that the outcome of Bali is insufficient when compared with the nature of the challenge posed by climate change. However, it can nevertheless be considered a success in terms of 'Realpolitik' in paving the way for the negotiations ahead, because some real changes have been discerned in the political landscape. The challenges for the road towards Copenhagen are manifold: the sheer volume and complexity of the issues and the far-reaching nature of decisions such as differentiation between non-Annex I countries pose significant challenges in themselves, while the dependency on the electoral process in the USA introduces a high element of risk into the whole process. The emergence of social justice as an issue turns climate policy into an endeavour to improve the world at large - thereby adding to the complexity. And, finally, the biggest challenge is the recognition that the climate problem requires a global solution, that Annex I and non-Annex I countries are mutually dependent on each other and that only cooperation regarding technology in combination with significant financial support will provide the chance successfully to tackle climate change.",,"climate change; complexity; environmental policy; global climate; mapping; social justice; Asia; Bali; Denmark; Eurasia; Europe; Indonesia; Kobenhavn [Denmark]; Lesser Sunda Islands; Malay Archipelago; North America; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Southeast Asia; Sunda Isles; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42949124879

Four approaches are used in this study for the delineation of homogeneous regions: The first one is the hierarchical cluster analysis approach which leads to fixed hydrologic regions. The second one is the canonical correlation analysis (CCA) which allows the determination of hydrologic neighborhoods that are specific to the site of interest. The third one is a revised version of the canonical correlation analysis approach that is free of parameter optimization and which can be automated easily. Finally, the fourth one is the technique of canonical kriging which consists in interpolating hydrological variables over the canonical physiographical space. The methods based on the canonical correlation analysis approach provide also the basis for identifying the explanatory variables to be used during the step of regional estimation. Regional estimation is carried out based on a multiple regression approach. A data set of 29 stations from several Mexican River Basins in and around the Balsas region is used to show the advantages and weaknesses of each method and to demonstrate their usefulness in the context of regional flood quantile estimation. This study allows also to test the robustness of these methods through their application to a real world case study with a relatively limited number of stations. While all methods performed quite adequately, results indicate clearly the advantages of the neighborhood type of approach and the superiority of the canonical correlation analysis based methods. Results demonstrate that CCA-based methods lead to best performances overall. While hierarchical clustering seems generally to lead to less biased quantile estimates, the lowest root mean square error values are almost consistently obtained for the CCA-based methods. Results seem also to point out that all methods are quite sensitive to the quality and quantity of data available.

Because of its known usage time frame, the presence of MTBE can help estimate the age of gasoline releases to the environment. However, because of its ubiquity, its presence can no longer be used to fingerprint, or differentiate, gasoline plumes in groundwater. Compound-specific stable carbon isotope analysis has recently become a method for differentiating MTBE sources and plumes affecting groundwater. In the present study, groundwater samples were collected from 20 monitoring wells located at two gasoline service stations in central New Jersey in an attempt to differentiate the dissolved gasoline plumes and possibly identify their sources. The carbon isotope ratio (13C/12C expressed as δ13C) values for each sample were determined through gas chromatography-isotope ratio-mass spectrometry (GCIRMS), and the impacted area for each plume was delineated. As biological degradation of MTBE proceeds, δ13C becomes heavier; petroleum-degrading bacteria preferentially assimilate the lighter 12C isotope, thereby enriching the residual MTBE in the heavier 13C isotope. The isotopic composition of MTBE at different locations demonstrated the varying degree to which MTBE had been altered by biodegradation. The δ13C values can also provide insight into the type of release and the magnitude of biodegradation. Two types of leaks occurred at the sites: a shallow piping leak and deeper leak from a tank system. δ13C values in the vicinity of the shallow leak were heavier, revealing increased biodegradation in the soil, while δ13C values in the vicinity of the tank leak were lighter, revealing the lack of biological degradation in non-aqueous phase liquid (NAPL) trapped beneath the water table. An assessment is provided where the physical site characteristics responsible for petroleum weathering are considered in comparison with the measured δ13C values.

We use a numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model performing a set of simulations of shock waves generated in the corona and from the result we compute the plasma emission for the O VI and Si XII, including the effects of Non Equilibrium Ionization (NEI). We analyze the radiative and spectral properties of our model with the support of a detailed radiation model, including Doppler dimming and an analytical model for shocks, and, finally, we synthesize the expected O VI 1032 Åline profile.Results. We explain several spectral features of the observations like the absence of discontinuities in the O VI emission during the shock passage, the brightening of Si XII emission, and the width of the lines. We also use our model to give very simple and general predictions for the strength of the line wings due to the ions shock heating and on the line shape for Limb Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) or Halo CMEs. Conclusions: The emission coming from the post-shock region in the solar corona roughly agrees with the emission from a simple planar and adiabatic shock, but the effect of thermal conduction and the magnetic field may be important depending on the event parameters. Doppler dimming significantly influences the O VI emission while Si XII line brightens mainly because of the shock compression. Significant shock heating is responsible for the wide and faint component of the O VI line usually observed, which may be taken as a shock signature in the solar corona. © 2008 ESO.","Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD); Sun: corona; Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs)","Mathematical models; Shock waves; Solar system; Ultraviolet radiation; Coronal mass ejections (CME); Solar corona; Magnetohydrodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41649109045

How can we determine whether specific regional climate projections may be untrustworthy in the light of such generic deficiencies? A calibration method is proposed whose basis lies in the emerging notion of seamless prediction. Specifically, calibrations of ensemble-based climate change probabilities are derived from analyses of the statistical reliability of ensemble-based forecast probabilities on seasonal time scales. The method is demonstrated by calibrating probabilistic projections from the multimodel ensembles used in the Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), based on reliability analyses from the seasonal forecast Development of a European Multimodel Ensemble System for Seasonal-to-Interannual Prediction (DEMETER) dataset.

Laser action requires a carrier injection large enough for emission to exceed absorption at laser wavelengths. Thus, strong self-absorption at luminescent wavelengths raises the operating current of LEDs, lasers, and optical amplifiers. Here we demonstrate that, contrary to conventional expectations, materials designed with novel deep centers achieve surprisingly large optical emission while, simultaneously, the inverse process of optical absorption remains very small. A striking consequence is that materials designed with our novel deep centers achieve transparency at a carrier injection which is four-orders-of-magnitude lower than in all technologically important semiconductors. Simultaneously, and surprisingly, our novel deep centers in GaAs achieve an optical gain, Einstein B coefficient, and radiative efficiency significantly larger than in direct-band-gap materials at 1.3-1.5 μm. We engineered this dramatic reduction of the injection to achieve transparency while retaining strong optical emission in our novel material by making use of a Franck-Condon shift of absorption away from luminescent wavelengths. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.",,"Energy gap; Light absorption; Luminescence; Optical emission spectroscopy; Semiconductor materials; Wavelength; Density-of-states; Laser action; Optical emission; Optical materials",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36148951035

Microbial biomass (C mic) was maximum during February (718 μg CO2-C g -1). Similar was the case of fumigated CO2-C (560 μg CO2-C g-1 10 d-1), SIR (2900 μg CO 2-C g-1) and BR (480 μg CO2-C g -1).

Higher CO2 concentrations (20-25%) combine the above-mentioned photochemical changes with enhanced non-photochemical quenching of surplus energy, which leads to an enhanced steady-state fraction of 'open' (oxidized) PSII reaction centers (q p), and minimize the excitation pressure of PSII (1 - qp) under very high light intensities (approximately 1700 μmol m-2 s-1 maximal value), avoiding the photoinhibition and leading to an enormous biomass production (approximately 2500%).

Despite this, Israel's industrial emissions to the air are not governed by an overall legislation, but instead are controlled by a voluntary agreement - a covenant - between the industrialists and the Ministry of the Environment. Why did the Ministry of the Environment opt for a covenant as a means of regulating industrial emissions rather than legislation? This paper uses the Policy Process Networks framework, which focuses on the role that different state and non-state actors play in the policy process, and on the network's institutional setting, to analyse and explain how this policy was formed. It also explores why the policy's implementation and enforcement are limited. By forming the covenant, the Ministry was able to gain better control over emissions.

Anthropogenic activities such as cultivation of flooded rice and application of waste materials, such as sewage sludge which are rich in C and N, as soil amendments could contribute to the increase in emission of greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) into the atmosphere. Therefore, evaluation of flux of various greenhouse gases from soils amended with sewage sludge is essential to quantify their release into the atmosphere. Two soils with contrasting properties (Candler fine sand [CFS] from Florida, and Ogeechee loamy sand [OLS] from Savannah, GA) were amended with varying rates (0, 24.7, 49.4, 98.8, and 148.3 Mg ha- 1) of 2 types of sewage sludge (industrial [ISS] and domestic [DSS] origin. The amended soil samples were incubated in anaerobic condition at field capacity soil water content in static chamber (Qopak bottles). Gas samples were extracted immediately after amending soils and subsequently on a daily basis to evaluate the emission of CH4, CO2 and N2O. The results showed that emission rates and cumulative emission of all three gases increased with increasing rates of amendments. Cumulative emission of gases during 25-d incubation of soils amended with different types of sewage sludge decreased in the order: CO2 > N2O > CH4. The emission of gases was greater from the soils amended with DSS as compared to that with ISS. This may indicate the presence of either low C and N content or possible harmful chemicals in the ISS. The emission of gases was greater from the CFS as compared to that from the OLS. Furthermore, the results clearly depicted the inhibitory effect of acetylene in both soils by producing more N2O and CH4 emission compared to the soils that did not receive acetylene at the rate of 1 mL g- 1 soil. Enumeration of microbial population by fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and most probable number (MPN) procedure at the end of 25-d incubation demonstrated a clear relationship between microbial activity and the emission of gases. The results of this study emphasize the need to consider the emission of greenhouse gases from soils amended with organic soil amendments such as sewage sludge, especially at high rates, and their potential contribution to global warming.

We studied fine root and aboveground biomass and production in five northern hardwood and three conifer stands differing in soil Ca status at Sleepers River, VT; Hubbard Brook, NH; and Cone Pond, NH. Neither aboveground biomass and production nor belowground biomass were related to soil Ca or Ca:Al ratios across this gradient. Hardwood stands had 37% higher aboveground biomass (P = 0.03) and 44% higher leaf litter production (P &lt; 0.01) than the conifer stands, on average. Fine root biomass (&lt;2 mm in diameter) in the upper 35 cm of the soil, including the forest floor, was very similar in hardwoods and conifers (5.92 and 5.93 Mg ha-1). The turnover coefficient (TC) of fine roots smaller than 1 mm ranged from 0.62 to 1.86 y-1 and increased significantly with soil exchangeable Ca (P = 0.03). As a result, calculated fine root production was clearly higher in sites with higher soil Ca (P = 0.02). Fine root production (biomass times turnover) ranged from 1.2 to 3.7 Mg ha-1 y-1 for hardwood stands and from 0.9 to 2.3 Mg ha-1 y -1 for conifer stands. The relationship we observed between soil Ca availability and root production suggests that cation depletion might lead to reduced carbon allocation to roots in these ecosystems. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Aboveground biomass; Aboveground production; Acid rain; Cone Pond; Fine root biomass; Fine root production; Fine root turnover; Hubbard Brook; Sleepers River","acid rain; biological production; biomass allocation; calcium; coniferous tree; deciduous tree; fine root; leaf litter; nutrient availability; phytomass; soil nutrient; Cone Pond; Hubbard Brook; New Hampshire; North America; Sleepers River; United States; Vermont; Acer saccharum; Coniferophyta; Picea; Picea rubens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41149141260

Emission sampling and analysis of mercury at inlet and outlet of air pollution control devices (APCDs) for various sources have been made as the first attempt in Korea and now several institutions in governmental sectors are preparing the inventory on mercury. Speciation whether mercury forms are elemental or oxidized, was also studied by employing two different types of sampling method: Ontario Hydro(OH) method and US EPA 101A. Mercury emission and speciation depended on the Hg concentration in the fuels, type of APCDs, and flue gas temperature and composition. Measurement results showed that elemental mercury (Hg0) was dominant at stack of coal power plants, while oxidized mercury was dominant at stack of incinerators, which could be due to the formation of mercury compounds in furnaces and APCDs configuration differences between them. The data for other sources were also obtained to understand the mercury emission. More intensive investigations were performed for a power plant and a municipal waste incinerator for observing the distribution of mercury at all the effluents. Mass balance of mercury in the process was figured out from the emission data and analysis results of mercury at all the in- and out-streams such as fuel (coals or wastes) fed, lime/lime stone, fly ash, bottom ash, gypsum and effluent water from wet flue-gas desulfurization(FGD). Approximate Hg mass balance could be obtained from sampled and analyzed data for those processes. However, a series of long-term and comprehensive studies are required to evaluate the reliable Hg distribution at coal-fired power plants and municipal waste incinerators. There were no significant differences between two sampling methods, but OH method seemed to have more advantage for Hg sampling from plants because mercury speciation was a very important factor for estimating the mercury emission and control efficiency from combustion flue gas. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

In the United States, there is currently a public policy debate over the use of coal to produce liquid transportation fuels to increase energy security and decrease dependence on imported petroleum and refined products. There are a number of challenges to be faced by a possible CTL industry, and one of the largest relates to the magnitude of carbon dioxide (CO2) generated, from synthetic fuel production as well as from the combustion of the synthetic transportation fuel itself. CO2, produced by conversion of hydrocarbons to energy, primarily via fossil fuel combustion, is one of the most ubiquitous and significant greenhouse gases (GHGs). Concerns over climate change precipitated by rising atmospheric GHG concentrations have prompted many industrialized nations to begin adopting limits on emissions to inhibit increases in atmospheric CO2 levels. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change states as a key goal the stabilization of atmospheric GHGs at a level that prevents “dangerous anthropogenic interference” with the world's climate systems. This will require sharply reducing CO2 emissions across the globe, and ultimately a fundamental shift in the way in which energy is produced and consumed. This article provides an overview of the challenge posed by the magnitude of CO2 that would be produced from a developing CTL industry. The status and costs associated with carbon dioxide capture and geologic storage (CCS) technologies are discussed as a means of helping to mitigate the CO2 issue, along with remaining challenges that must be overcome for an emerging CTL industry to move toward maturity. However, even if CCS can be safely and successfully applied to CTL plants, CO2 emissions will still likely be greater than conventional liquid transportation fuel production from conventional petroleum. © 2008 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, Ltd.",,"Anthropogenic interference; Atmospheric CO; Carbon dioxide capture; Carbon emissions; Climate system; Coal resources; Energy security; Fossil fuel combustion; Geologic storage; Hydrocarbon conversion; Industrialized nations; Liquid transportation; Refined products; Transportation fuels; United nations framework convention on climate changes; Carbon dioxide; Coal; Coal combustion; Coal deposits; Coal industry; Coal transportation; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbons; Liquids; Petroleum refining; Petroleum transportation; Synthetic fuels; Carbon monoxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70450033630

We compared historical records (1954-1958) with results from recent plant surveys (2003-2005) from alpine to nival ecosystems in the Rhaetian Alps, N-Italy. The presence of all vascular plant species and their maximum altitude were recorded along a continuous altitudinal transect of 730 m. An increase in species richness from 153 to 166 species was observed. Moreover, 52 species were recorded from altitudes 30-430 m higher than their 1950s limits, which corresponds to a median migration rate of 23.9 m/decade. In order to explain the observed migrations, the species wind-dispersal ability (diaspore weight and morphology) and the air temperature variation from 1926 to 2003 were considered. Species with more pronounced altitudinal shifts possess lighter diaspores. The highest increase in species richness was found between 2800 and 3100 m a.s.l.; this appears to be related to an estimated shift of the permafrost limit by +240 m during the last 50 years. The mean air temperature in the region rose by +1.6 °C in summer and by +1.1 °C in winter within this period. Climate warming is therefore considered as a primary cause of the observed upward migration of high mountain plants. Calculated altitudinal migration rates, however, varied remarkably among species. This would imply differential abilities of species to persist in an increasingly warmer climate. Species-specific conservation measures, including ex situ conservation, may therefore be required. © 2007 Gesellschaft für Ökologie.","Alpine-nival ecosystems; Climate change; Diaspore; Historical records; Long-term observation; Monitoring; Species richness; Wind-dispersion","Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949158417

In contrast to broad-band photometry, in which several emission lines are integrated within one filter, the narrow-band filters are designed to transmit only one emission line (in ideal cases). This method has considerable advantages over spectroscopic methods: we are able to obtain spatial resolution, i.e. several objects fit in only one exposure frame; the required time for an observation run is shortened; and lastly, the observation procedures and reduction are less complicated than those of a spectroscopic survey. Usually during a run information for only a few lines (three or four at best) can be obtained, in contrast to the full spectrum obtained in spectroscopy: see, for example, the works of Belley & Roy (1992), where hundreds of HII regions are presented with fluxes in three emission lines using direct imaging, and van Zee et al. (1998), with only about a dozen HII regions in ten different emission lines employing optical spectroscopy. Narrow-band imaging is a powerful tool for characterizing the physical properties of the star-forming regions in nearby galaxies. With a few lines, we are able to determine, for example, the abundance, temperature, or initial mass function of the ionizing stars, thus obtaining clues to the physical processes that occur in the core of the HII regions; see, for example, Cedrés & Cepa (2002). This can be seen in Figure 8.1, where the composite broad-band image (with the B, R, and K bands) and an Hα image of the galaxy UCM 2325+2318 can be compared. The star-forming regions are clearly defined in the narrow-band image.",,"Aluminum alloys; Electromagnetic wave emission; Galaxies; Spectroscopic analysis; Stars; Broad-band images; Narrow band filter; Narrowband imaging; Optical spectroscopy; Spatial resolution; Spectroscopic method; Spectroscopic surveys; Star-forming region; Optical emission spectroscopy",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927039170

In the basin and range province in Nevada, USA, springs in the Great Basin and Mojave deserts are sustained by interconnected deep carbonate and shallow basin-fill aquifers which are threatened by proposed groundwater withdrawal to sustain rapidly expanding urban areas, a common problem in arid regions worldwide. This paper draws on historic groundwater data, groundwater modeling, and studies of environmental controls of spring ecosystems to speculate on the potential effects of groundwater withdrawal and water table decline on spring-supported vegetation. The focus is on springs in the Great Basin and Mojave deserts representative of those that may be affected by future, planned groundwater withdrawal. Groundwater withdrawal is expected to reduce spring discharge directly through reduced flows from the shallow basin-fill aquifer or through reduction of the hydraulic head of the deep carbonate aquifer. This flow reduction will truncate the outflow stream, reducing the areal cover of wetland and wetland/upland transition vegetation. Lowering the local water table may also reduce the amount of upland phreatophytic vegetation by causing water levels to drop below plant rooting depths. Percolation of salts to surface soils may be reduced, eventually altering desert shrub cover from halophytes to nonhalophytes. The extent of these effects will vary among springs, based on their distance from extraction sites and location relative to regional groundwater flow paths. On-site monitoring of biotic variables (including cover of selected hygrophytes and phreatophytes) should be a necessary complement to the planned monitoring of local hydrologic conditions. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.","Great Basin Desert; Groundwater; Hydrology; Mojave Desert; Salinity; Springs; Vegetation; Water table; Wetlands","Great Basin Desert; Mojave Desert; Water table; Aquifers; Ecosystems; Hydrology; Saline water; Wetlands; Vegetation; ground water; aquifer; desert; discharge; groundwater flow; hydraulic head; hydrological modeling; percolation; spring water; urban area; vegetation dynamics; water level; water table; wetland; desert; ecosystem; halophyte; hydrology; hydrophyte; model; nonhuman; phreatophyte; plant root; review; shrub; United States; vegetation; wetland; Nevada; Plants; Wetlands; Basin and Range Province; Great Basin; Mojave Desert; North America; United States; Bos",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39149099156

Survey data were used to develop mode share models for five different categories of shipments between 18 city pairs. A railyard catchment approach was taken to arrive at estimates of contestable intercity truck traffic using a subset of the Ontario Ministry of Transportation's Commercial Vehicle Survey. CO2 emissions were based on current truck traffic estimates, and emissions factors obtained from MOBILE6.2C. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Sequestration of carbon by newly established trees is not only another important environmental benefit, but also a potential commercial benefit. To obtain estimates of carbon sequestered by species of commercial potential in such regions, we calibrated the carbon (C) accounting model FullCAM to Eucalyptus cladocalyx and Corymbia maculata plantations. This was achieved by harvesting trees of a range in sizes to determine the allometric relationships that most accurately predict biomass and stem density from measures of stem diameter. Predictions of stem diameter were obtained from a forest growth model (3-PG) previously calibrated for these two species. By applying these predictions of changes in stem diameter as the stand matures in our allometric relationships, we estimated changes in partitioning of biomass (between stem, branches, bark, foliage and roots) and stem wood density as the stand matures under scenarios of 500, 600 and 750 mm mean annual rainfall. We found that for both species, regardless of annual rainfall, throughout the rotation 37-50% of carbon sequestered in the total tree biomass was in the stem, 18-27% in both branches and roots, and the remainder in foliage or bark. However, rate of accumulation of carbon was dependent on annual rainfall, with average annual rate of sequestration of carbon in tree biomass and litter during the first rotation of E. cladocalyx (or C. maculata) increasing from 3.68 (or 4.17) to 4.72 (or 4.86) Mg C ha-1 yr-1 as annual rainfall increased from about 500 to 750 mm. Although it was predicted that decomposition negated any accumulation of debris between successive rotations, carbon was predicted to accumulate in sawlog products, given that assumed rates of product decomposition were slightly less than their rate of accumulation. This resulted in a slight increase (&lt;8 Mg C ha-1) in predicted total sequestration of carbon between successive rotations. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

One of the most promising methods of curbing GHG emissions is a world transition from fossil fuels to renewable sources of energy. Solar photovoltaic (PV) cells offer a technically sustainable solution to the projected enormous future energy demands. This article explores utilizing industrial symbiosis to obtain economies of scale and increased manufacturing efficiencies for solar PV cells in order for solar electricity to compete economically with fossil fuel-fired electricity. The state of PV manufacturing, the market and the effects of scale on both are reviewed. Government policies necessary to construct a multi-gigaWatt PV factory and complementary policies to protect existing solar companies are outlined and the technical requirements for a symbiotic industrial system are explored to increase the manufacturing efficiency while improving the environmental impact of PV. The results of the analysis show that an eight-factory industrial symbiotic system can be viewed as a medium-term investment by any government, which will not only obtain direct financial return, but also an improved global environment. The technical concepts and policy limitations to this approach were analyzed and it was found that symbiotic growth will help to mitigate many of the limitations of PV and is likely to catalyze mass manufacturing of PV by transparently demonstrating that large-scale PV manufacturing is technically feasible and reaches an enormous untapped market for PV with low costs. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The sharp growth of the energy sector has been accompanied by institutional reforms. One of the most important developments has been liberalization of all energy sectors, including electricity production and distribution, to private capital both national and foreign. Economic analysis of the potential effects of energy and carbon taxes yields important conclusions bearing on policy choices. States have played a leading role in protecting the environment by reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHGs). State emissions are significant on a global scale. Broad-based carbon/energy taxes are among the most promising and important of the emerging tools for promoting reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Carbon taxes can play an important role in a strategy to control carbon dioxide emissions while raising revenue. To limit international emissions of GHGs, the authorities introduced carbon taxes. Relative to traditional state energy taxes such as motor fuel taxes, carbon taxes offer several advantages: the broader base allows a specified revenue need to be met with a lower rate; the carbon tax promotes environmental quality, adding to its policy benefits and political appeal; the tax burden is broadly distributed over the commercial, residential, and industrial sectors; and the tax causes less economic distortion than other energy taxes. Conventional financing of major infrastructure projects would only increase the amount of foreign credit, thus Turkey has conceived other options for financing projects.","Carbon tax; Energy economy; Energy policy; Greenhouse gas emissions","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Crude petroleum; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Industrial economics; Oil well production; Economic distortion; Environmental quality; Energy policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37749042186

This paper investigates environmental impacts of micro cogeneration by carrying out a detailed life cycle assessment and an analysis of local air quality impacts of micro cogeneration systems. Most micro cogeneration systems are superior, as far as the reduction of GHG emissions is concerned, not only to average electricity and heat supply, but also to state-of-the art separate production of electricity in gas power plants and heat in condensing boilers. The GHG advantages of micro cogeneration plants are comparable to district heating with CHP. Under the assumption that gas condensing boilers are the competing heat-supply technology, all technologies are within a very narrow range. Looking at the GHG reduction potential on the level of a supply object (e.g. a single-family house) by modeling the operation with a CHP optimization tool, the achievable mitigation potential is somewhat lower, because the micro cogeneration systems do not supply the whole energy demand. Here, fuel cells offer the advantage of a higher power-to-heat ratio. Environmental impacts other than those related to climate and resource protection relate more specifically to technology. In addition to investigating the emissions side, analysis of the air quality situation of a residential area supplied by reciprocating engines was carried out. The analysis shows that for the selected conditions, the additional emission of NOx due to the engines do not create severe additional environmental impacts. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

R. Science 2000, 290, 1937] as it is neither compatible with the standard rule of three-dimensional chemical bonding nor with the maximum tetracoordination. Herein we undertake a comprehensive study of the planar tetra- (ptC), penta- (ppC), and hexacoordinate carbon (phC) by covering the whole family of carbon-boron mixed clusters C m=1-4Bn=4-8 and their anions. The potential energy surface of every carbon-boron cluster is sampled by using the basin-hopping global search algorithm coupled with ab initio geometry optimization. A large number of planar tetra-, penta-, and hexacoordinate carbon (local-minimum) structures are obtained. Several structures such as the phC consisting of C2B 5, C2B5-, etc. are reported for the first time. In particular, a ptC corresponding to the global minimum of CB 4 is revealed, which appears to be highly stable for future synthesis. The boron-centered isomers are generally the more stable structures for planar multicoordinate carbons (ptC, ppC, and phC). The planar tetra-, penta-, and hexacoordinate boron are the prevalent structural motifs in low-lying isomers of the carbon-boron clusters. However, stability of the ptC and ppC units can be reinforced over the boron-centered isomers by attaching proper hydrocarbon unit -(CH)n- to form the so-called ""hyparenes"" [Wang, Z.

Spectroscopic and thermal analyses of these hydrogels as a function of protonation showed that the results are consistent with the existence of an H-bridged complex when the imidazole rings are partially protonated. Finally, the efficiency and binding trends of Cu2+, Co2+, Cd2+ and Pb2+ ions with both protonated and unprotonated poly(VIm/MA) hydrogels were determined. Results: Gelation of 90% was reached at around 180 kGy dose at the end of irradiation. The poly(VIm/MA) hydrogels synthesized were further protonated in HC1 solutions with different concentrations. Hydrogels originally showed 450% volumetric swelling; this ratio reached 1900% after protonation at pH = 5.0. Fourier transform infrared spectral changes in the +N-H stretching region (3200-3600 and 1173 cm-1) and the ring mode deformation at 915 cm-1 are consistent with the formation of an H-bridged complex between the protonated and unprotonated imidazole rings upon partial protonation. Similar changes were obtained from NMR spectra of both the protonated and unprotonated forms of the hydrogels. Conclusion: Protonated and unprotonated hydrogels have been used in heavy metal ion adsorption studies for environmental purposes. Adsorption decreased with decreasing pH value due to the protonation of the VIm ring. The adsorption of Me2+ ions decreased in the order Cu2+ &gt; Co2+ &gt; Cd2+ &gt; Pb2+, which is related to the complexation stability as well as the ionic radius of the metal ions. These results show that P(VIm/MA) hydrogels can he used efficiently to remove heavy metal ions from aqueous solutions. However, the protonated form is a bad choice for heavy metal ion adsorption due to electrostatic repulsion forces; it can nevertheless be assumed to be a good choice for anion adsorption from environmental waste water systems. © 2007 Society of Chemical Industry.","Complexation; Maleic acid; NMR; Poly(N-vinylimidazole); Protonation","Adsorption; Complexation; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; pH effects; Protonation; Solutions; Thermoanalysis; Maleic acid; Polyvinylimidazole; Quaternized form; Hydrogels; Adsorption; Complexation; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Hydrogels; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; pH effects; Protonation; Solutions; Thermoanalysis; deformation; hydrogel; pH; thermal property",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40649127971

Temperature and residue type are important factors that regulate residue decomposition and CH4 production. However, the response of the methanogenic archaeal community to these factors in rice field soil is not well understood. In the present experiment, the structure of the archaeal community was determined during the decomposition of rice root and straw residues in anoxic rice field soil incubated at three temperatures (15°C, 30°C, and 45°C). More CH 4 was produced in the straw treatment than root treatment. Increasing the temperature from 15°C to 45°C enhanced CH4 production. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism analyses in combination with cloning and sequencing of 16S rRNA genes showed that Methanosarcinaceae developed early in the incubations, whereas Methanosaetaceae became more abundant in the later stages. Methanosarcinaceae and Methanosaetaceae seemed to be better adapted at 157deg;C and 30°C, respectively, while the thermophilic Methanobacteriales and rice cluster I methanogens were significantly enhanced at 45°C. Straw residues promoted the growth of Methanosarcinaceae, whereas the root residues favored Methanosaetaceae. In conclusion, our study revealed a highly dynamic structure of the methanogenic archaeal community during plant residue decomposition. The in situ concentration of acetate (and possibly of H2) seems to be the key factor that regulates the shift of methanogenic community. Copyright © 2008, American Society for Microbiology.

A tax set at an exogenous rate that does not depend on the state of technology reduces growth, the level of consumption of each good, and raises the number of firms. The induced increase in the variety of goods is a benefit not considered in previous analyses. In terms of environmental benefits, the tax induces a positive rate of pollution abatement that offsets the ""dirty"" side of economic growth. A tax set at an endogenous rate that holds constant the tax burden per unit of output, in contrast, has ambiguous effects on growth, the scale of activity of each firm and the number of firms. Besides being novel, the potential positive growth effect of this type of effluent tax is precisely what makes this instrument effective for welfare-maximizing purposes. The socially optimal policy, in fact, requires the tax burden per unit of output to equal the marginal rate of substitution between the growth rate of consumption and abatement. Moreover, a tax/subsidy on entry is needed, depending on whether the contribution of product variety to pollution dominates consumers' love of variety. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc.","Effluent taxes; Environment; Growth; Market structure; R&D","Economic analysis; Marketing; Research and development management; Taxation; Effluent taxes; Market structure; Environmental engineering; abatement cost; cost-benefit analysis; effluent; emission control; growth; market system; pollution tax; resource allocation; technological change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38149069061

We investigated the effects of two-year perennial grass and mixed grass/legume leys in a six-year crop rotation on topsoil (0-0.25 m depth) carbon content and on grain yields of winter wheat over a period of 31 years. Different nitrogen fertilisation regimes were included and no manure was added to the experimental plots. We used data from long-term crop rotation experiments at three sites in southern Sweden: Säby (59°49′ N/17°42′ E), Lanna (58°20′ N/13°07′ E) and Stenstugu (57°36′ N/18°26′ E). At Säby, the reduction in topsoil carbon content was smaller in the ley crop rotations than in the crop rotation with only annual crops. There were no statistically significant effects of crop rotation on topsoil carbon at the other two sites. At Lanna, the grain yield increase in winter wheat over time was higher in the mixed legume/grass ley crop rotation than in the other two rotations. Together, these effects of ley on topsoil carbon and winter wheat yield suggest that replacing annual crops with leys in the crop rotation could reduce losses of soil carbon without decreasing total yield of annual crops on a regional scale. We also applied the Introductory Carbon Balance Model (ICBM) to simulate topsoil carbon content at the three sites. Based on the results, measures to improve the model predictability are proposed. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Annual crops; Carbon sink; ICBM; Mineral fertiliser; Nitrogen; Soil carbon reduction; Two-year ley","carbon balance; carbon sequestration; crop rotation; crop yield; fertilizer application; grass; legume; long-term change; nitrogen; perennial plant; soil carbon; soil organic matter; wheat; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44049102532

Depending on the definition and system boundary of the NEI, the mitigation options and priorities may vary. The territorial system boundary used by the UNFCCC has been critiqued for not including international transportation and potentially causing carbon leakage. To address these issues, past literature has argued in favour of using consumption-based NEI in climate policy. This article discusses several issues in moving from the standard production-based NEI to consumption-based NEI. First, two distinct accounting approaches for constructing consumption-based NEI are presented. The approaches differ in the allocation of intermediate consumption of imported products. Second, a consistent method of weighting production-based and consumption-based NEI is discussed. This is an extension of the previous literature on shared responsibility to NEI. Third, due to increased uncertainty and a wide system boundary it may be difficult to implement consumption-based NEI directly into climate policy. Several alternative options for incorporating consumption-based inventories into climate policy are discussed. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Many post-Kyoto frameworks have been debated, but surprisingly approaches that focus on consumption have received little attention in the climate change literature despite broader interest in other areas. In this article we extend the argument for constructing GHG inventories using a country's consumption rather than production. First, we argue that constructing GHG inventories using a country's economic activity instead of geographic territory solves allocation issues for international activities such as international transportation and carbon capture and storage. Second, we argue that consumption-based GHG inventories have many advantages over production-based inventories. The main advantages are to address carbon leakage, reduce the importance of emission commitments for developing countries, increase options for mitigation, encourage environmental comparative advantage, address competitiveness concerns, and naturally encourage technology diffusion. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climate change; Concentration (process); Economic analysis; Environmental impact; Environmental integrity; Greenhouse gas inventories; Greenhouse gases; carbon; economic activity; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; Kyoto Protocol; mitigation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37549014154

Although each of these themes has seen considerable attention in the modeling and forecasting communities, their joint effects remain little explored and poorly understood. We developed ecological niche models for 1804 species from the European flora, which we projected globally to identify areas of potential distribution, both at present and across 4 scenarios of future (2055) climates. As expected from previous studies, projections based on the CGCM1 climate model were more extreme than those based on the HadCM3 model, and projections based on the a2 emissions scenario were more extreme than those based on the b2 emissions scenario. However, less expected were the highly nonlinear and contrasting projected changes in distributional areas among continents: increases in distributional potential in Europe often corresponded with decreases on other continents, and species seeing expanding potential on one continent often saw contracting potential on others. In conclusion, global climate change will have complex effects on invasive potential of plant species. The shifts and changes identified in this study suggest strongly that biological communities will see dramatic reorganizations in coming decades owing to shifting invasive potential by nonnative species. © 2008 Peterson et al.",,"article; climate change; controlled study; ecological niche; Europe; flora; geographic distribution; global climate; native species; nonhuman; plant community; species invasion; climate; ecology; plant physiology; theoretical model; Climate; Ecology; Europe; Models, Theoretical; Plant Physiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49249133130

Here we performed a field experiment with annual plants growing along a steep climatic gradient in Israel to isolate climatic effects for local trait expression. The focus trait was seed dormancy, for which many theoretical predictions exist regarding climate-driven optimal germination behaviour. We evaluated how germination is consistent with theory, indicating local adaptation to current and changing climatic conditions, and how it varies among species and between natural and standardised soil conditions. We reciprocally sowed seeds from three or four origins for each of three annual species, Biscutella didyma, Bromus fasciculatus and Hymenocarpos circinnatus, in their home and neighbouring sowing locations along an aridity gradient. Our predictions were: lower germination fraction for seeds from more arid origins, and higher germination at wetter sowing locations for all seed origins. By sowing seeds in both local and standard soil, we separated climatic effects from local conditions. At the arid sowing location, two species supported the prediction of low germination of drier seed origins, but differences between seed origins at the other sites were not substantial. There were no clear rainfall effects on germination. Germination fractions were consistently lower on local soil than on standard soil, indicating the important role of soil type and neighbour conditions for trait expression. Local environmental conditions may override effects of climate and so should be carefully addressed in future studies testing for the potential of species to adapt or plastically respond to climate change. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Bet-hedging; Bioclimatic envelope approach; Mediterranean climate; Reciprocal sowing experiment; Unpredictable environments","adaptation; annual plant; climate change; climate conditions; climate effect; environmental effect; experimental study; gene expression; germination; Mediterranean environment; angiosperm; article; climate; geography; germination; growth, development and aging; physiology; plant seed; soil; Angiosperms; Climate; Geography; Germination; Seeds; Soil; Biscutella; Bromus; Bromus fasciculatus; Hymenocarpos circinatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41149110940

In particular, information is lacking to constrain spatial variability associated with GHG emissions (CH4, CO2, and N2O). GHG fluxes typically vary with edaphic, hydrologic, biologic, and climatic factors. In the PPR, characteristic wetland plant communities integrate hydropedologic factors and may explain some variability associated with trace gas fluxes at ecosystem and landscape scales. We addressed this question for replicate wetland basins located in central North Dakota stratified by hydropedologic vegetation zone on Jul 12 and Aug 3, 2003. Data were collected at the soil-atmosphere interface for six plant zones: deep marsh, shallow marsh, wet meadow, low prairie, pasture, and cropland. Controlling for soil moisture and temperature, CH4 fluxes varied significantly with zone (p &lt; 0.05). Highest CH4 emissions were found near the water in the deep marsh (277,800 μg m- 2 d- 1 CH4), which declined with distance from water to - 730 μg m- 2 d- 1 CH4 in the pasture. Carbon dioxide fluxes also varied significantly with zone. Nitrous oxide variability was greater within zones than between zones, with no significant effects of zone, moisture, or temperature. Data were extrapolated for a 205.6 km2 landscape using a previously developed synoptic classification for PPR plant communities. For this landscape, we found croplands contributed the greatest proportion to the net GHG source strength on Jul 12 (45,700 kg d- 1 GHG-C equivalents) while deep marsh zones contributed the greatest proportion on Aug 3 (26,145 kg d- 1 GHG-C equivalents). This was driven by a 30-fold reduction in cropland N2O-N emissions between dates. The overall landscape average for each date, weighted by zone, was 462.4 kg km- 2 d- 1 GHG-C equivalents on Jul 12 and 314.3 kg km- 2 d- 1 GHG-C equivalents on Aug 3. Results suggest GHG fluxes vary with hydropedologic soil zone, particularly for CH4, and provide initial estimates of net GHG emissions for heterogeneous agricultural wetland landscapes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

This system is remarkable in that the structure of the chromium sites strongly resemble those in chromium bis-benzene Cr1(C6H 6)2, as judged by geometry and charge density properties. The electron localization function of the sandwich shows a hexagonally arrayed set of V(C, Cr, C) valence basins about each chromium atom with modification due to local site symmetry. This system satisfies an extension of the 18-electron rule to components of a conjugated molecular system. This idea is explored further by examining the electronic and geometric properties of the series Crn,R2, where n and R are given by n = 1, benzene C 6H6 as reference; n = 2, biphenyl (C6H 5)2; n = 3, triphenylene C18H12; n = 3, coronene C24H18; and n = 4, dibenzopyrene C 24H14. On the basis of electron counting and ring isolation, all the sandwich structures in this series could satisfy the extension of the 18-electron rule, with the exception of coronene, which was deliberately included. The DFT calculations predict spin-paired ground states for some but not all of the sandwich structures, implying that the Cr-ring interactions at work require understanding at a deeper level. Thus, while sandwiches with n = 1, n = 2, n = 4 and n = 7 have spin paired singlet ground states and appear to satisfy the rule, those with n = 3 (triphenylene, coronene) have antiferromagnetic singlet ground states and do not. This is attributed to nonuniformity in the electronic charge density of the rings of the isolated hydrocarbons and to a reduction of symmetry from D3h to C 2v with a concomitant spin-charge density change in the sandwiches. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Ab initio; Density functional theory (DFT) calculations; Aromatic compounds; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Chromium; Hydrocarbons; Organic compounds; Probability density function; Density functional theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43849101365

Airglow emissions, such as previously observed from NO and O (0-0) on Venus, provide insight into the chemical and dynamical processes that control the composition and energy balance in the upper atmospheres of planets. The OH airglow emission has been observed previously only in the Earth's atmosphere where it has been used to infer atomic oxygen abundances. The O (0-1) airglow emission also has only been observed in the Earth's atmosphere, and neither laboratory nor theoretical studies have reached a consensus on its transition probability. Aims. We report measurements of night-side airglow emission in the atmosphere of Venus in the OH (2-0), OH (1-0), O (0-1), and O (0-0) bands. This is the first detection of the first three of these airglow emissions on another planet. These observations provide the most direct observational constraints to date on H, OH, and O, key species in the chemistry of Venus' upper atmosphere. Methods. Airglow emission detected at wavelengths of 1.40-1.49 and 2.6-3.14 m in limb observations by the Visible and Infrared Thermal Imaging Spectrometer (VIRTIS) on the Venus Express spacecraft is attributed to the OH (2-0) and (1-0) transitions, respectively, and compared to calculations from a photochemical model. Simultaneous limb observations of airglow emission in the O (0-0) and (0-1) bands at 1.27 and 1.58 m, respectively, were used to derive the ratio of the transition probabilities for these bands. Results. The integrated emission rates for the OH (2-0) and (1-0) bands were measured to be and kR respectively, both peaking at an altitude of km near midnight local time for the considered orbit. The measured ratio of the O (0-0) and (0-1) bands is . Conclusions. Photochemical model calculations suggest the observed OH emission is produced primarily via the Bates-Nicolet mechanism, as on the Earth. The observed ratio of the intensities of the O (0-0) and (0-1) bands implies the ratio of their transition probabilities is . © 2008 ESO.","Astrochemistry; Infrared: solar system; Molecular processes; Planets and satellites: individual: Venus; Radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; Techniques: spectroscopic","Atmospheric chemistry; Industrial emissions; Mathematical models; Phase composition; Probability; Solar system; Spectrometers; Airglow emission; Astrochemistry; Atomic oxygen; Molecular processes; Radiation mechanisms; Planets",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43849098376

Vascular plant composition and soil temperature records were obtained for five summits (from 1729 m to 2114 m a.s.l.) using sampling protocols from the Global Observation Research Initiative in Alpine Environments program. Species richness was examined against altitude, aspect and climatic variables at different spatial scales (10 × 10 cm quadrats, 1 m2 quadrats, clusters of 4*1 m2 quadrats, for the summit area above a line 5 m altitudinally below the summit (the -5 m isoline), for the extended summit down to the -10 m isoline). About 75 taxa (70 species, 5 graminoid genera) were recorded, 9 of which are endemic to the small alpine area of ∼100 km2. There were significant linear relationships between species richness and altitude and climatic variables for the top to -5 isolines on the summits. However, there was no consistent pattern for species richness at other spatial scales, altitude, aspect or climatic variables. The proportion of species for the whole summits with localised distributions (local endemics) increased with altitude. Predicted increasing temperatures and reduced snowcover is likely to result in an increase in species richness as shrubs, herbs and introduced weeds become more common at higher altitude. Because Australian alpine areas occur in narrow altitudinal bands with no nival zone, there are no higher altitudinal refuges available for alpine species. Therefore many of these species are likely to be at risk of extinction from climate change. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Alpine zone; Altitude gradient; Climate change; Endemics; Exotics; Weeds","alpine environment; altitudinal zonation; climate change; community composition; endemic species; extinction risk; soil temperature; species diversity; species richness; vascular plant; weed; Australasia; Australia; Australian Alps; Snowy Mountains; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46249096059

However, such models are limited in their accuracy by uncertain estimates of the spatial and temporal characterization of emissions and meteorology. Site-specific observations can more accurately characterize the distribution of pollutants, but cannot predict the effectiveness of emission controls. In this research, we use equilibrium theory and a chemical transport model to find observable indicators that are robust predictors of the change in PM2.5 nitrate due to changes in NH3, SO2, and NOx emissions. Two conditions are necessary: (1) the indicator must be valid at both instantaneous equilibrium and regulatory (daily and monthly) time-scales and (2) the indicator must be able to explain the majority of the spatial and temporal variance in the PM2.5 nitrate sensitivity. We find that the ratio of free ammonia to total nitrate meets these conditions during the winter in the Eastern United States. This observable ratio can be used to predict the percent change in PM2.5 nitrate due to SO2 and NH3 emissions reductions with nearly zero bias when compared with an emission driven chemical transport model. This permits a novel method for estimating the effectiveness of emission control strategies. The chemical transport model can be used to derive the relationship between the observed concentrations and the change in nitrate due to emission changes. Then observations can be used to apply that relationship to specific locations of interest.","Air-quality modeling; Impacts of emission reductions; Inorganic aerosol system; Particulate matter","Aerosols; Air quality; Emission control; Meteorology; Nitrogen compounds; Air-quality modeling; Chemical transport model; Equilibrium theory; Particulate emissions; ammonia; nitrate; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; emission control; estimation method; nitrate; particulate matter; pollutant transport; air pollutant; air pollution; article; chemical analysis; gas; particulate matter; prediction; priority journal; United States; winter; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38749131171

A sharp genetic division at Cape Finisterre, as evidenced by all 3 markers, delimits 2 regions. This genetic discontinuity coincides with an abrupt change in plankton composition, climate and oceanographic characteristics, suggesting that contemporary influences on gene flow associated with the presence of an ecological barrier maintain the genetic subdivision in NW Spain. However, the genetic structure also accords to some extent with an isolation-by-distance model despite the heterogeneous gene flow due to this ecological barrier. Microsatellites and shell size showed a strong and significant covariation in pairwise differences (FST and QST) among populations, but no correlation was found between these markers and AFLPs. Similarly, both microsatellites and shell size showed a higher differentiation between the 2 regions than within each region, but this pattern was reversed for AFLPs. Differences in genomic sampling error and homoplasy could account for the discrepancy between different kinds of markers.

Therefore, a very promising approach to improve the engine efficiency and to lower the pollutant emission is to optimize the fuel composition. Several diesel-like fuels with varying aromatic concentrations (mono-, di-, tri- and total aromatics) and oxygenating components have already shown potential for soot reduction in diesel engines, which is of interest when looking at future biofuel components, which will most likely have particularly higher oxygen contents. 2nd generation biofuels, e. g. ethanol for SI engines and Fischer-Tropsch diesel for CI engines, have already demonstrated their positive influence on the engine performance, when the combustion system is specifically adapted.

The various position papers all expressed a fear that European industry would be put at a financial and operational disadvantages as a result of the trading scheme. Industry was concerned that the trading scheme should not provide an incentive to relocate plants outside the EU and/or increase imports into the EU. In this respect, critical parts of the initial proposal were those related to allocation burden, sharing and costs of compliance. This continues to be industry's major concern. Although its preferred approach to certain issues has not changed - placing the major burden of GHG reduction on energu-intensive industries and the need to include all GHG and all Kyoto mechanisms - its former preference for national allocation has changed, and although free allocation continues to be favored over auctioning, some sectors are now well advanced in developing practical approaches based on benchmarking. The preamble to the proposed directive makes a number of references to the importance of improved certainty and predictability. However, it is clear from the text that the extent to which this may be achieved is limited, on account of: • the unknown nature and coverage of the expected international agreement on the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions • the mismatch in timing between any such international agreement and Phase III of the European scheme, which is further compounded by the substantial lead time for industry to respond to any new requirements. Sectors impacted by the directive tend to be capital intensive, and as such have long investment cycles for the installation of the new plant required for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. As a consequence, industry as a whole has been vociferous in its demands to bring forward some of the key dates within the directive, namely: • publication of the Commission of the absolute quantity of allowances for 2013 by 30 June 2010 (Article 9) • adoption by the Commission of a regulation on the timing, administration and other aspects of auctioning, by 31 December 2010 (Article 10(5)) • Adoption by the Commission by 30 June 2011 of measures for allocation (Article 10a) • not later than June 2010; the submission by the Commission to the European Parliament and the Council of an analytical report on the energy-intensive sectors or sub-sectors that have been determined to be exposed to significant risks of carbon leakage (Article 10b) • publication by Member States and submission to the Commission of the list of installations covered by this directive in its territory and any free allocation to each installation by 30 September 2011 (Article 11). Although an early decision on these factors would give industry some of the certainty it desires, it would also reduce the time available for the collection of data to demonstrate that specific sectors are 'competitively impacted'. As the 'conclusion of an international agreement' is the trigger for a number of actions within the directive, industry has been anxious to determine the exact meaning of this phrase. Key to the timing of the measures highligthed above is the Copenhagen Climate Conference (COP 15) in December 2009 at which the UN climate negotiations on the post-2012 framework are expected to be finalised. Alhough the proposal makes no direct reference to COP 15, the dates of Commission decisions are clearly based upon the conclusion of these negotiations (Article 9). An argument against more prescriptive definition of an 'international agreement' is that the definition of any pre-conditions by the EU would be counter-productive to the negotiation of such an agreement. Likewise, clearer definition of the quantitative aspect of the proposed directive might limit the Commission's flexibility once an international agreement has been concluded. France has added a further dimension to the dynamics of the parliamentary process by expressing a desire to obtain a first reading agreement by December 2008, during its Presidency of the EU. If an early agreement is to be achieved, it may not be possible for the directive to include every issue to the required level of detail, and some may be left to the comitology procedure following its publication. Thus parliamentarians are faced with the dilemma of the extent to which contentious issues should be delegated to a process over which they have relatively little control.

Effects of CO2 enrichment on leaf transpiration are well-documented, but our understanding of how CO2 interacts with other variables to regulate evapotranspiration from plant communities is more limited. 2. A series of weighing lysimeters in which tallgrass prairie species had been planted were exposed to a subambient to elevated gradient in CO 2 in a field chamber. Lysimeters with intact monoliths of three soil types were represented along the CO2 gradient. We used regression analysis to determine how CO2 effects on evapotranspiration per unit of soil surface area (ETsoil) and per unit of leaf area (ET la) depended on variation in leaf area index (LAI) and diurnal changes in environmental variables during the initial 6 weeks of CO2 treatment. 3. CO2 enrichment reduced ETsoil and ET la, and together with air temperature and LAI accounted for most of the variance in daily values of evapotranspiration explained by multiple regression models. The CO2 effect on ETsoil did not depend on values of other variables, but CO2 enrichment reduced ET la most at relatively low air temperatures and low LAI for all soils combined. Higher temperatures countered the CO2 effect by increasing ETla more at elevated than subambient CO2. Higher LAI countered the CO2 effect by decreasing ETla more at subambient than elevated concentrations. Plant (LAI) and environmental effects on ETla differed among soils, possibly because plant growth patterns and physiology differed among soils. 4. Our results imply that the CO 2 effect on evapotranspiration per unit of leaf area will vary with seasonal change in temperature and LAI, independent of seasonal shifts in leaf age and physiological activity.","C3-C4 grassland; Leaf area index; Lysimeter; Soil type; Temperature","air temperature; carbon dioxide; environmental effect; evapotranspiration; grass; growth; leaf area index; nutrient enrichment; physiology; plant community; prairie; regression analysis; soil type",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38149082614

The graphite evaporation and chemical-erosion processes were studied with absolutely calibrated spectroscopic systems of the visible region. Spectroscopic experiments yielded data on the flow of carbon atoms from the surface of a plasma collector and on the contribution of chemical erosion to the surface-damage process.

The development of such a reactor structure necessitates a deeper understanding of fission energy transport and materials behavior in radiation dominated structures. One solution to reduce the greenhouse-gas emissions and delay the catastrophic events' occurrences may be the development of massive nuclear power. The actual basic conceptions in nuclear reactors are at the base of the bottleneck in enhancements. The current nuclear reactors look like high security prisons applied to fission products. The micro-bead heterogeneous fuel mesh gives the fission products the possibility to acquire stable conditions outside the hot zones without spilling, in exchange for advantages - possibility of enhancing the nuclear technology for power production. There is a possibility to accommodate the materials and structures with the phenomenon of interest, the high temperature fission products free fuel with near perfect burning.

The relative reduction state of the primary quinone receptor of photosystem II (QA) was used as a surrogate for photosystem II (PSII) vulnerability to photoinactivation. Measurements were made on needles from the lower, mid and upper canopy of 21-year-old Pinus radiata D. Don trees grown with (N+) and without (N0) added N fertilizer. Rubisco was 45 to 60% higher in needles of N+ trees than in needles of NO trees at all canopy positions. Chlorophyll was ∼80% higher in lower- and mid-canopy needles of N+ trees than of N0 trees, but only ∼20% higher in upper-canopy needles. Physiological differences between N+ and N0 trees were found only in the lower- and mid- canopy positions. Needles of N+ trees dissipated up to 30% less light energy as heat than needles of N0 trees and had correspondingly more reduced QA. Net CO2 assimilation and the proportions of electrons used by alternative electron sinks such as the Mehler reaction and photorespiration were unaffected by N treatment regardless of canopy position. We conclude that the application of N fertilizer mainly affected the biochemistry and light-use physiology in lower- and mid-canopy needles by increasing the amount of chlorophyll and hence the amount of light harvested. This, however, did not improve photochemistry or safe dissipation, but increased PSII vulnerability to photoinactivation, an effect with likely significant consequences during sunflecks or sudden gap formation. © 2008 Heron Publishing.","Canopy; Chlorophyll; N fertilizer; Photoprotection; Photosynthesis; Rubisco","carbon dioxide; chlorophyll; coniferous tree; fertilizer application; light; nitrogen; nutrient availability; photochemistry; photosynthesis; physiology; Pinus radiata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42049093776

Significant reductions would likely impose especially large costs on the United States, and recent projections suggest that the United States is not among the nations most at risk from climate change. In these circumstances, what does justice require the United States to do? Many people believe that the United States is required to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions beyond the point that is justified by its own self-interest, simply because the United States is wealthy, and because the nations most at risk from climate change are poor. This argument from distributive justice is complemented by an argument from corrective justice: The existing ""stock"" of greenhouse gas emissions owes a great deal to the past actions of the United States, and many people think that the United States should do a great deal to reduce a problem for which it is disproportionately responsible. But there are serious difficulties with both of these arguments. On reasonable assumptions, redistribution from the United States to poor people in poor nations would be highly desirable, but expenditures on greenhouse gas reductions are a crude means of producing that redistribution: It would be much better to give cash payments directly to people who are now poor. The argument from corrective justice runs into the standard problems that arise when collectivities, such as nations, are treated as moral agents: Many people who have not acted wrongfully end up being forced to provide a remedy to many people who have not been victimized Without reaching specific conclusions about the proper response of any particular nation, and while emphasizing that welfarist arguments strongly support some kind of international agreement to protect against climate change, we contend that standard arguments from distributive and corrective justice fail to provide strong justifications for imposing special obligations for greenhouse gas reductions on the United States.

Furthermore, we report on spectral, spatial and timing analysis of the combined X-ray observations performed so far for this system. Fitting a total of ∼1100 photons, we show that the X-ray spectrum of the J0737-3039 system is very soft, and not satisfactorily modeled by a simple blackbody or an atmospheric model. However, it is not possible yet to discriminate between a predominantly nonthermal and a predominantly thermal origin for the X-ray emission. Adopting a simple power-law emission model, the photon index (Γ = 3.7 ±0.4, 90% confidence interval) and the implied conversion efficiency of the rotational energy of PSR J0737-3039A into X-ray emission (4.1 ±0.5 × 10-4, for a distance to the source of 500 pc) are compatible with the X-ray photons being emitted in the magnetosphere of PSR J0737-3039A. This hypothesis is also supported by the absence of detectable X-ray orbital modulation (up to ∼20%, 3 σ) or any X-ray nebular emission and it is in agreement with the high (≳75%) X-ray pulsed fraction of PSR J0737-3039A. A two blackbody or a Comptonized blackbody model also reproduce the data, and the upper limit to the value of the hydrogen column density, NH ≲1 × 1020 cm -2, is in better agreement (with respect to the power-law model) with the Galactic NH in that direction and at that distance. For the two blackbody model the implied emission radii and temperatures are also compatible with those seen in other recycled pulsars, calling for the bulk of the X-ray photons being originated from heated regions at the surface of pulsar A. On the other hand, in the Comptonized blackbody model, the electron temperature seems to be significantly smaller than in other similar objects. © 2008. The American Astronomical Society.

The resulting concentrates showed excellent MWNT pre-dispersion. Due to the high interfacial energy between MWNT and PE, the nanotubes migrate into matrix polymers with lower interfacial energies, like polycarbonate and polyamide, and thereby remain in their excellent dispersion state.

GCIRS 3 is the most prominent MIR-source in the central parsec of the Galaxy. NIR spectroscopy has failed to solve the enigma of its nature. The properties and peculiarities of extreme individual objects in the central stellar cluster contribute to our knowledge of star and dust formation close to a supermassive black hole. Aims. We initiated an unprecedented interferometric experiment to understand the nature of GCIRS 3, where we investigate its properties as a spectroscopic and interferometric reference star at 10 m. Methods. VLT/VISIR imaging separates a compact source from diffuse, surrounding emission. The VLTI/MIDI instrument was used to measure spectroscopically resolved visibility moduli at an angular resolution of ~10 mas of that compact 10 m source, still unresolved by a single VLT. Recent NIR/MIR photometry data were added to enable simple SED- and full radiative transfer-modeling of the data. Results. The luminosity and size estimates show that IRS 3 is probably a cool carbon star enshrouded by a complex dust distribution. Blackbody temperatures were derived. The coinciding interpretation of single telescope and interferometric data confirm dust emission from several different spatial scales. The interferometric data resolve the inner rim of dust formation. Despite observed deep silicate absorption towards GCIRS 3, we favor a carbon-rich circumstellar dust shell. The silicate absorption most probably takes place in the outer diffuse dust, which is mostly ignored by MIDI measurements, but very observable in complementary VLT/VISIR data. This indicates physically and chemically distinct conditions of the local dust, changing with the distance to GCIRS 3. Conclusions. We have demonstrated that optical long baseline interferometry at infrared wavelengths is an indispensable tool for investigating sources at the Galactic center. Our findings suggest further studies of the composition of interstellar dust and the shape of the 10 m silicate feature in this extraordinary region. © 2008 ESO.","Galaxy: center; Instrumentation: interferometers; ISM: dust, extinction; Stars: supergiants","Dust; Infrared radiation; Interferometry; Particulate emissions; Stars; Wavelength; Infrared wavelengths; Interstellar dust; Galaxies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39849097516

Digital elevation data used to evaluate coastal vulnerability to flooding are available at various horizontal and vertical resolutions. However, the quality of digital elevation models (DEM) used in environmental assessment can significantly affect the detection of topographic features and the magnitude of hydrological processes. We used lidar elevation data in coastal North Carolina, USA to investigate the effects of horizontal resolution and connectivity on the extent and timing of flooding from sea-level rise. We found that the rate and extent of inundation were dependent on horizontal resolution and assumptions made on hydrological connectivity. The variation in flood extent was much larger (760 km2) at low sea-level projections (&lt;0.4 m) than at high sea-level projections (&gt;∼0.9 m, 114 km2) due to the effect of hydrological corrections on the coarse-scale DEM and topographic complexity at low elevations. Lidar elevation data provide a significant advance in mapping potential coastal flooding, but the extent and timing of inundation are sensitive to horizontal resolution and the modelling of hydrological connectivity.","Coastal flooding; Connectivity; Horizontal resolution; Lidar; North Carolina; Sea-level rise","accuracy assessment; detection method; digital elevation model; environmental monitoring; flooding; lidar; modeling; raster; sea level change; spatial analysis; North America; North Carolina; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549114947

Here, a simple stochastic rainfall-runoff model representing 238 river basins on the Australian continent was used to assess the sensitivity of the risk of runoff changes to various sources of uncertainty. Uncertainties included global mean temperature change, greenhouse gas stabilisation targets, catchment sensitivities to climatic change, and the seasonality of runoff, rainfall, and evaporation. Model simulations provided estimates of the first-order risk of climate change to Australian catchments, with several regions having high likelihoods of experiencing significant reductions in future runoff. Climate uncertainty (at global and regional scales) was identified as the dominant driving force in hydrological risk assessments. Uncertainties in catchment sensitivities to climatic changes also influenced risk, provided they were sufficiently large, whereas structural assumptions of the model were generally negligible. Collectively, these results indicate that rigorous assessment of climate risk to water resources over relatively long time-scales is largely a function of adequately exploring the uncertainty space of future climate changes. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

One method of compensating for the spillover at some location outside of a structure is to estimate it as the counts blurred into this location when a template (3D model) of the structure undergoes simulated imaging followed by reconstruction. The objective of this study was to determine what impact uncorrected respiratory motion has on such spillover compensation of extra-cardiac activity in the right coronary artery (RCA) territory, and if it is possible to use manual segmentation to define the extra-cardiac activity template(s) used in spillover correction. Two separate MCAT phantoms (1283 matrices) were simulated to represent the source and attenuation distributions of patients with and without respiratory motion. For each phantom the heart was modeled: 1) with a normal perfusion pattern and 2) with an RCA defect equal to 50% of the normal myocardium count level. After Monte Carlo simulation of 64 × 64 × 120 projections with appropriate noise, data were reconstructed using the rescaled block iterative (RBI) algorithm with 30 subsets and 5 iterations with compensation for attenuation, scatter and resolution. A 3D Gaussian post-filter with a sigma of 0.476 cm was used to suppress noise. Manual segmentation of the liver in filtered emission slices was used to create 3D binary templates. The true liver distribution (with and without respiratory motion included) was also used as binary templates. These templates were projected using a ray-driven projector simulating the imaging system with the exclusion of Compton scatter and reconstructed using the same protocol as for the emission data, excluding scatter compensation. Reconstructed templates were scaled using reconstructed emission count levels from the liver, and spillover subtracted outside the template. It was evident from the polar maps that the manually segmented template reconstructions were unable to remove all the spillover originating in the liver from the inferior wall. This was especially noticeable when a perfusion defect is present. Templates based on the true liver distribution appreciably improved spillover correction. Thus the emerging combined SPECT/CT technology may play a vital role in identifying and segmenting extra-cardiac structures more reliably thereby facilitating spillover correction. This study also indicates that compensation for respiratory motion might play an important role in spillover compensation. © 2008 IEEE.","Cardiac SPECT; Partial volume; Respiratory motion; Spillover compensation","Cardiac SPECT; Respiratory motion; Spillover compensation; Cardiology; Mathematical models; Three dimensional computer graphics; Medical imaging",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39049145256

Method: Before the law came into effect, we tested the air quality of 22 dormitory and common areas within six North Carolina prisons using standard protocols for testing particulate matter. We measured particulate matter 2.5 μm in diameter (PM2.5) using state of the art TSI SidePak monitors. After the law went into effect, the same locations within each prison were tested again. Written inmate surveys were also conducted at two prisons, one with partial smoking ban (indoors only) and one with a total smoking ban (indoors and outdoors). Results: The findings indicate that, on average, levels of respirable suspended particulates (RSPs), an accepted marker for secondhand smoke (SHS) levels, decreased 77% in these prisons after the law took effect compared to levels obtained before ban implementation. Several areas were tobacco-free before the implementation of this ban. In those areas no significant decreases in RSPs were noted. Conclusion: Laws banning tobacco use in correctional facilities can significantly reduce indoor SHS exposure among inmates, visitors and staff and potentially lead to reduced use. To date, 24 US states have enacted 100% smoke-free correctional facility polices for all indoor areas even though inmates and staff have much higher tobacco use prevalence rates than the general population. With an estimated nine million people incarcerated worldwide, prison smoking bans could have a substantial impact in terms of health outcomes and long-term costs if they can effectively reduce exposure to secondhand smoke.",,"adult; article; clinical trial; health care policy; human; indoor air pollution; legal aspect; multicenter study; particulate matter; passive smoking; prison; smoking; United States; Adult; Air Pollution, Indoor; Health Policy; Humans; North Carolina; Particulate Matter; Prisons; Smoking; Tobacco Smoke Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149100559

Materials and Methods: This study used a collaborative model for improvement involving researchers from the Johns Hopkins University and Michigan Health and Hospital Association. A quality improvement team in each ICU collected and submitted baseline data and implemented quality improvement interventions. Primary outcome measures were improvements in safety culture scores using the Teamwork Climate Scale of the Safety Attitudes Questionnaire (SAQ); 99 ICUs provided baseline SAQ data. Baseline performance for adherence to evidence-based interventions for ventilated patients is also reported. The intervention to improve safety culture was the comprehensive unit-based safety program. The rwg statistic measures the extent to which there is a group consensus. Results: Overall response rate for the baseline SAQ was 72%. Statistical tests confirmed that teamwork climate scores provided a valid measure of teamwork climate consensus among caregivers in an ICU, mean rwg was 0.840 (SD = 0.07). Teamwork climate varied significantly among ICUs at baseline (F98, 5325 = 5.90, P &lt; .001), ranging from 16% to 92% of caregivers in an ICU reporting good teamwork climate. A subset of 72 ICUs repeated the culture assessment in 2005, and a 2-tailed paired samples t test showed that teamwork climate improved from 2004 to 2005, t(71) = -2.921, P &lt; .005. Adherence to using evidence-based interventions ranged from a mean of 25% for maintaining glucose at 110 mg/dL or less to 89% for stress ulcer prophylaxis. Conclusion: This study describes the first statewide effort to improve patient safety in ICUs. The use of the comprehensive unit-based safety program was associated with significant improvements in safety culture. This collaborative may serve as a model to implement feasible and methodologically rigorous methods to improve and sustain patient safety on a larger scale. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of the study was to determine the main sources of sulphur deposition on this pine forest. Sulphur isotope measurements from the SO2 power plant stack emissions were used to identify the isotopic signature of this source. Net throughfall fluxes of sulphur (26.1 kg S ha1 yr-1) and nitrogen (16.3 kg N ha-1 yr-1) were higher-5-25 times higher for S and 5-15 times for N-at this site than in other forests in Catalonia. Sulphur isotope analysis confirmed that the net throughfall fluxes of sulphur were mostly due to the dry deposition of the SO2 power plant emissions onto the pine canopies. Two potential atmospheric end-members were distinguished: regional background rainwater (δ34S=+7.2‰) and power plant emissions (δ34S=-2.8‰). By applying a two-component sulphur isotope mixing model, we found that during periods of low power plant activity (≤10 emission h day-1), 62% of the throughfall sulphate could be attributed to the power plant emissions. At higher activity periods (≥14 emission h day-1), this contribution rose to 73%. Although power plant contribution to bulk deposition was lower in both cases (34% and 45%), the possible influence of sulphate coming with long-range transport events from the polluted areas in the Mediterranean basin (δ34S≈0‰) was not discarded. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The models are shown to predict similar directions of the changes in PM2.5 mass and component (sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and organic compounds) concentrations in response to changes in emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and volatile organic compounds (VOC), except for the effect of SO2 reduction on nitrate and the effect of VOC reduction on PM2.5 mass. Furthermore, in many cases where the directional changes are consistent, the magnitude of the changes are significantly different among models. Examples are the effects of SO 2 and NOx reductions on nitrate and PM2.5 mass and the effects of VOC reduction on organic compounds, sulfate and nitrate. The spatial resolution significantly influences the results in some cases. Operational model performance for a PM2.5 component appears to provide some useful indication on the reliability of the relative response factors (RRFs) for a change in emissions of a direct precursor, as well as for a change in emissions of a compound that affects this component in an indirect manner, such as via oxidant formation. However, these results need to be confirmed for other conditions and caution is still needed when applying air quality models for the design of emission control strategies. It is advisable to use more than one air quality model (or more than one configuration of a single air quality model) to span the full range of plausible scientific representations of atmospheric processes when investigating future air quality scenarios. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Air quality; Ammonia; Concentration (process); Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Organic compounds; Oxidants; Particulate emissions; Sulfur dioxide; Atmospheric particulate matter; Gaseous precursors; Precursor emissions; Emission control; ammonia; nitrate; nitrogen oxide; organic compound; oxidizing agent; sulfate; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; Air quality; Ammonia; Concentration (process); Emission control; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Organic compounds; Oxidants; Particulate emissions; Sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric particle; comparative study; concentration (composition); design; environmental response; numerical model; oxidant; particulate matter; pollution control; volatile organic compound; air pollution control; air quality; article; atmospheric dispersion; concentration (parameters); gas; mathematical model; particulate matter; precursor; reduction; reliability; simulation; United States; Air; Atmosphere; Computer Simulation; Geography; Models, Theoretical; Particulate Matter; United States; Nashville; North America; Tennessee; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949197405

Nevertheless, they have strong connections: changes in climate and societal responses to climate change may exacerbate the impacts of invasive species, whereas invasive species may affect the magnitude, rate, and impact of climate change. We argue that the design and implementation of climate-change policy in the United States should specifically consider the implications for invasive species; conversely, invasive-species policy should address consequences for climate change. The development of such policies should be based on (1) characterization of interactions between invasive species and climate change, (2) identification of areas where climate-change policies could negatively affect invasive-species management, and (3) identification of areas where policies could benefit from synergies between climate change and invasive-species management. © 2008 Society for Conservation Biology.","Adaptation; Biofuel; Climate change; Conservation policy; Invasive species; Invasive species control; Mitigation; Nutria; Prevention of species invasion; Sea ice","adaptation; biofuel; biological invasion; climate change; conservation planning; ecological impact; environmental policy; invasive species; management; mitigation; rodent; sea ice; adaptation; animal; bioenergy; climate; demography; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; greenhouse effect; methodology; Phalaris; physiology; Poaceae; policy; review; rodent; United States; Adaptation, Physiological; Animals; Bioelectric Energy Sources; Climate; Conservation of Natural Resources; Demography; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Phalaris; Poaceae; Public Policy; Rodentia; United States; North America; United States; Myocastorinae",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949256259

Soil amendments with chemicals such as thiosulfate (S2 O32 -) can reduce fumigant emissions. A field study was conducted near Santa Maria, CA to determine the effects of low density polyethylene (LDPE) and virtually impermeable film (VIF) over raised-beds and applying potassium thiosulfate (KTS) in furrows on reducing chloropicrin (CP) emissions from a strawberry field. Four fields (or treatments) were tested with 224 kg ha-1 CP drip-applied three cm under the soil surface. The CP flux from bed tops and furrows and gas-phase concentrations under the tarps were monitored for five d. The CP emission flux and concentration under tarp were highest immediately following application. Diurnal temperature change affected CP concentration and emission fluxes (higher values during the day and lower at night). Slightly higher CP cumulative emission occurred using LDPE tarp (19%) compared to VIF (17%). Normalized flux (CP emission flux from the beds divided by CP concentration under the tarp) being estimated from field measurement was slightly higher for LDPE than VIF indicating different tarp permeability in the field. Because of extremely low emissions from the furrows (&lt;0.2% of total emission loss), KTS application to furrow treatments did not show further emission reductions than non-KTS treatments. This indicates that emission reduction should focus on the tarp above raised-beds when fumigant was drip-applied near bed-surface. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

However, as a potential problem in the long run, risks associated with geological storage of CO2, such as leakage to the groundwater and atmosphere, might pose significant threats to local communities and surrounding environment. Identification and evaluation of such risks are essential for the long-term management of CO2 storage. Doing so requires a set of advanced technologies in order to well understand the long-range transportation of CO2 and its impact mechanisms. This study developed an integrated decision support framework for the Weyburn Field. This system included modules of data management, inexact hybrid numerical simulation, optimization for CO2 EOR processes, hybrid fuzzy-stochastic risk assessment, and post-modeling analysis. A user-friendly interface was designed through visual language programming. Such an effort would provide project managers with a collection of measures for analyzing and visualizing operations and development of different applicable technologies. Valuable information can be provided to EOR project operators about what might be required for new projects or project expansions and how to go about gathering and using the data they will need.","CO2 sequestration; Decision support system; Reservoir modeling; Weyburn","Carbon dioxide; Computer simulation; Decision support systems; Groundwater; Problem solving; Reservoir management; Geologic storage; Oil recovery; Visual language programming; Weyburn; Management science",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42649134520

The site preparation methods tested were excavation of planting holes (H), subsoiling (S), and subsoiling with addition of urban solid refuse to soil (S + USR). Five years after plantation establishment, trees in the S + USR treatment were over three times larger than those in the S treatment, and nearly five-fold larger than those planted in holes. Differences in tree biomass per hectare were even greater due to disparities in initial planting density and pine tree mortality among treatments. Pine trees in the S + USR treatment showed higher foliar P concentration, δ13C and δ15N than those in the S or H treatments. Foliar δ15N data proved that trees in the S + USR treatment utilized USR as a source of nitrogen. Foliar δ13C and δ18O data suggest that improved nutrient status differentially stimulated photosynthesis over stomatal conductance in the pine trees of the S + USR treatment, thus enhancing water use efficiency and growth. In the spring of 2002, trees in the S + USR treatment exhibited the most negative predawn water potentials of all the treatments, indicating that the rapid early growth induced by USR accelerated the onset of intense intra-specific competition for water. The results of this study have implications for the establishment and management of Aleppo pine plantations on semiarid soils. Planting seedlings at low density and/or early thinning of pine stands are strongly recommended if fast tree growth is to be maintained beyond the first few years after USR addition to soil. Foliar C, O and N isotope measurements can provide much insight into how resource acquisition by trees is affected by afforestation techniques in pine plantations under dry climatic conditions. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Wind and solar may get most of the attention, but evolving technologies in the use of biomass - including municipal, agricultural and forestry waste - are gaining recognition as important players in the debate about climate change and energy production. One technology that show promise is biomass plasma gasification, a method of creating a synthetic gas with which to generate power. The technology is a two-phase process, one that produces no carbon emissions and the second that produces slightly less than the natural gas it replaces. A plasma torch is used to produce temperatures as high as 30,000°F inside a reactor. This breaks the molecular bonds of organic feedstock materials, primarily into CO and hydrogen, while most of the inorganic materials melt to form a slag. The resulting synthesis gas is cooled and cleaned of constituents, which, depending on the feedstock, may include sulfur compounds, mercury or other volatile metals, particulates or HCl. Solena is working with a company in Spain to sequester the CO2 gas by feeding it to algae grown in columns. According to Dr. Robert Do, president and CEO of the company, one hectare of land can produce 30,000 ton of algae, enough to produce 10 kw/hr.

To meet the projected fuel ethanol demand needed to oxygenate the gasoline in the whole country, the construction of about five additional ethanol production plants is required.

The increasingly central role of state governments in American climate policy formation squares with recent experience in other Western democracies that share authority across governmental levels. This paper examines the American experience, considering factors that have contributed to a state-centric policy process and using that body of experience to assess competing strategic choices faced by individual states based on their mix of emission trends and policy adoption rates. In turn, the collective state experience allows for consideration of the varied political feasibility of competing climate policy tools that remain under active review in subnational, national, and international contexts.

In fact, fuel cells are one of the future practical solutions for micro-CHP systems (5-10 kW) in the domestic environment. This paper reports numerical and experimental results of 5 kWe CHP H-Power units running on natural gas. The natural gas is reformed locally to produce hydrogen. The numerical model of the units allows the simulation of the operation of the reformer, the cooler-shift, the prox (preferential oxidation reactor) and of the PEMFC. The PEMFC polarization curve is determined by a subroutine taking into account mass and charge transfers and the condensation of liquid water in the electrodes membrane assembly (EMA). The molar flux of species through the anode and cathode porous backing layers is calculated analytically by means of the Stefan-Maxwell equations. The gas channels are assumed parallel to the EMA, and the effects of concentration variation are investigated. The relevance of the numerical results is first validated by comparison with experimental data; then, the performances of the system are analyzed in terms of electrical efficiency.

As important as those measures will be in the effort to conserve Arctic marine mammals and ecosystems, they will not address the primary physical manifestations of climate change, such as loss of sea ice.

Raw AVHRR images were processed and geometric and radiometric corrections were performed. Seven-day maximum NDVI maps were produced and VCI was calculated using the maximum and minimum NDVI values for the same time period. Precipitation statistics from 19 synoptic meteorological stations were collected. The study covered a five-year time period with three consecutive months in the growing season. Pearson correlation was performed to correlate NDVI and VCI values to precipitation data. Different time lag schemes were tried and the highest correlation coefficients (r values) were obtained while correlating NDVI and VCI to three-month (current plus last two months) precipitation. Better agreement was observed between NDVI and precipitation as compared with that between VCI and precipitation in individual stations. Good correlations were also obtained between average NDVI and VCI of the study area and average three-month precipitation. The results indicated that NOAA-AVHRR derived NDVI well reflects precipitation fluctuations in the study area promising a possibility for early drought awareness necessary for drought risk management. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The van der Waals - London dispersion (vdW-Ld) interaction is the universal, long range, interaction that is present in all materials systems. However, scientists and engineers often either ignore or crudely approximate the vdW-Ld interactions because the calculations often appear impractical due to the 1) lack of the required full spectra optical properties and 2) lack of the proper geometrical formulation to give meaningful results. These two barriers are being actively eliminated by the introduction of robust ab initiocodes that can calculate anisotropic full spectral optical properties and by proper extensions to the Lifshitz vdW-Ld formulation that take into account anisotropic spectral optical properties as well as novel geometries. These new capabilities are of broad utility, especially in the biological community, because of the difficulty in experimental determination of full spectral optical properties of nanoscale, liquid phase biomolecules. Here we compare 3 levels of complexity of vdW-Ld interactions (optically isotropic planar, optically anisotropic planar, and optically anisotropic solid cylinder) as well as calculate and compare a variety of Hamaker coefficients relevant to these systems. For the latter two, more complex, cases, we use the ab initiooptical properties of single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). Our results show the effects of strong optical anisotropy upon the overall vdW-Ld interaction strength as well as the presence of strong dispersion-driven torques in both anisotropic cases, which can play a role in CNT alignment with other CNTs and also preferred CNT alignment directions with optically anisotropic substrates[1, 2]. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949086844

PAHs and their derivatives are produced by the incomplete combustion of organic material arising, partly, from natural combustion such as forest and volcanic eruption, but with the majority due to anthropogenic emissions. The PAH concentration varies significantly in various rural and urban environments and is mainly influenced by vehicular and domestic emissions. The review serves as a database to identify and characterize the emission sources of PAHs and hence various approaches including diagnostic ratio (DR) and principal component analysis (PCA) are discussed in detail. These approaches allow individual PAHs to be associated with their origin sources. The factors that effect PAH emission and estimated emission rate are also discussed in this paper. Although the levels of low molecular weight PAHs are high in vapor phase, most of the probable human carcinogenic PAHs are found to be associated with particulate matter, especially in fine mode particles in ambient air. Many countries have proposed a non-mandatory concentration limit for PAHs, whereas the health risk studies conducted in relation to PAH exposure, urge that these pollutants should be given a high priority when considering air quality management and reduction of impacts. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

For most rivers, the majority of dissolved inorganic carbon is in the form of bicarbonate. The riverine bicarbonate flux originates mainly from the dissolution of rock minerals by soil water carbon dioxide, a process called chemical weathering, which controls the buffering capacity and mineral content of receiving streams and rivers. Here we introduce an unprecedented high-temporal-resolution, 100-year data set from the Mississippi River and couple it with sub-watershed and precipitation data to reveal that the large increase in bicarbonate flux that has occurred over the past 50 years (ref. 3) is clearly anthropogenically driven. We show that the increase in bicarbonate and water fluxes is caused mainly by an increase in discharge from agricultural watersheds that has not been balanced by a rise in precipitation, which is also relevant to nutrient and pesticide fluxes to the Gulf of Mexico. These findings demonstrate that alterations in chemical weathering are relevant to improving contemporary biogeochemical budgets. Furthermore, land use change and management were arguably more important than changes in climate and plant CO2 fertilization to increases in riverine water and carbon export from this large region over the past 50 years. ©2008 Nature Publishing Group.",,"bicarbonate; carbon; carbon dioxide; pesticide; water; anthropogenic source; bicarbonate; biogeochemical cycle; carbon flux; chemical weathering; climate change; data set; dissolution; dissolved inorganic carbon; land use change; agriculture; anthropology; article; biogeochemical cycle; climate; Mexico; precipitation; priority journal; river; United States; watershed; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Mexico; Mississippi River; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38549167372

However, the finite size of the ensemble induces a sampling noise, which degrades the accuracy of the variance estimation. An idealized 1D framework is firstly considered, to show that the spatial structure of sampling noise is relatively small-scale, and is closely related to the background-error correlations. This motivates investigations on local spatial averaging, which is here applied to ensemble-based variance fields in this 1D context. It is shown that a spatial averaging, manually optimized, helps to significantly reduce the sampling noise. This provides estimates which are as accurate as those derived from a much bigger ensemble. The dependencies of this optimization on the error correlation length-scale and on the heterogeneity of the variance and length-scale fields are also illustrated. These results are next confirmed in a more realistic 2D problem, by considering the current operational version of the Arpège background-error covariance matrix. Finally, the possibility to objectively and automatically optimize the filtering is explored. The idea is to apply the usual linear estimation theory and to use signal/noise ratios in order to calculate an optimal filter. The efficiency of this objective filtering is illustrated in the idealized 1D framework.

Accumulated evidence indicates that lipid peroxidation is an early event during the evolution of the disease and occurs in patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Because MCI represents a condition of increased risk for Alzheimer's disease (AD), early detection of disease markers is under investigation. Previously we showed that HNE-modified proteins, markers of lipid peroxidation, are elevated in MCI hippocampus and inferior parietal lobule compared to controls. Using a redox proteomic approach, we now report the identity of 11 HNE-modified proteins that had significantly elevated HNE levels in MCI patients compared with controls that span both brain regions: Neuropolypeptide h3, carbonyl reductase (NADPH), α-enolase, lactate dehydrogenase B, phosphoglycerate kinase, heat shock protein 70, ATP synthase α chain, pyruvate kinase, actin, elongation factor Tu, and translation initiation factor α. The enzyme activities of lactate dehydrogenase, ATP synthase, and pyruvate kinase were decreased in MCI subjects compared with controls, suggesting a direct correlation between oxidative damage and impaired enzyme activity. We suggest that impairment of target proteins through the production of HNE adducts leads to protein dysfunction and eventually neuronal death, thus contributing to the biological events that may lead MCI patients to progress to AD. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

Growth and survival were analysed in response to climatic transfer distance, the difference in mean annual temperature (MAT) between the site and the population origin. Differences among populations at each site, and across sites for regional groups of populations, were related to climate transfer distance, but in opposite ways in the northern vs. southern parts of the species range. Climate transfers equivalent to warming by 1-4 °C markedly increased the survival of populations in northern Europe (≥ 62°N, < 2 °C MAT) and modestly increased height growth ≥ 57°N but decreased survival at < 62°N and modestly decreased height growth at < 54°N latitude in Europe.

The C and O partial density of states for the valence bands has been measured by SXE. Radiation induced changes in the chemical bonding in the material have been identified and these can be minimised by continuously translating the sample during measurement. The spectral changes induced by the radiation damage are consistent with the breaking of Si-CH3 bonds in the material and the formation of graphitic C = C double bonds. Investigation of the origin of a low energy subband in the C Kα spectrum reveal that it can be attributed to O Kα emission excited by second order rather than the hybridization of C 2p states in the CDO layer. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To detect the relatively small changes of total annual ammonia (NH3) emissions required under the Gothenburg Protocol, expert judgement is considered insufficient. We present, therefore, here a new Swiss NH3 emission inventory based on a detailed representative stratified survey on farm and manure management conducted on 1950 farms. The survey data was used to calculate NH3 emissions with the emission model DYNAMO for each farm participating in the survey. This allowed the effects of the variability of farm and manure management parameters among farms on the NH3 emissions to be fully taken into account. Weighted emission factors per animal for 24 livestock categories and 36 farm classes were used to upscale to the national inventory. The stratified sampling and the individual farm calculations allowed the comparison of emissions from specific regions and altitudes and the study of the variability among farms. The new emission inventory approach permits a more detailed analysis of the regional distribution of NH3 emissions as well as a more robust and standardised monitoring of the future development of emissions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In this context CO2 is one of the relevant gases and waste management is one of the relevant sectors. Referring to the situation in Europe, waste incineration is one of the major sources of CO2 in the waste management sector. The Kyoto Protocol, however, only covers CO2-emissions originating from fossil fuels, whereas the incineration of renewable materials, e.g. wood, is considered to be climate-neutral since it does not make any net contribution to the CO2 inventory of the atmosphere. Unlike the situation with municipal waste, there is little if any information on the CO2 -emissions caused by the incineration of hazardous waste in specialized plants, and the renewable fraction in these materials. The present paper focuses on this gap of knowledge. Taking the full-scale hazardous waste incineration plant in Biebesheim, Germany, as an example, a carbon balance was set up for the whole plant taking into account all other material flows. Afterwards the determination of the proportion of renewable materials in the hazardous waste incinerated by means of the radiocarbon method (14C) is reported.

Postfabrication rapid thermal annealing (RTA) and subsequent nitrous oxide (N2O) plasma treatment were employed to improve the performance of ZnO TFTs in terms of on-current and on/off current ratio. The RTA treatment increases the on-current of the TFT significantly, but it also increases its off-current. The off-current of 2 × 10-8 A and on/off current ratio of 3 × 103 obtained after the RTA treatment were improved to 10-10 A and 105, respectively, by the subsequent N2O plasma treatment. The better device performance can be attributed to the reduction of oxygen vacancies at the top region of the channel due to oxygen incorporation from the N2O plasma. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of the TFT samples showed that the RTA-treated ZnO surface has more oxygen vacancies than as-deposited samples, which results in the increased drain current. The XPS study also showed that the subsequent N2O plasma treatment reduces oxygen vacancies only at the surface of ZnO so that the better off-current and on/off current ratio can be obtained. © 2008 The Japan Society of Applied Physics.","N2 plasma; N2O plasma; Rapid thermal annealing; Thin-film transistor; ZnO","Annealing; Drain current; Gate dielectrics; Gates (transistor); Nitrides; Nitrogen oxides; Nonmetals; Oxygen; Oxygen vacancies; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Plasma applications; Plasma deposition; Plasmas; Rapid thermal annealing; Rapid thermal processing; Semiconducting organic compounds; Semiconducting zinc compounds; Silicon; Silicon nitride; Surface treatment; Thin film devices; Thin film transistors; Transistors; Vacancies; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Zinc; Zinc alloys; Zinc oxide; Channel layers; Device performances; Electrical characteristics; Gate configurations; N2 plasma; N2O plasma; Nitrous oxides; On/off current ratios; Oxygen incorporations; Plasma treatments; Reduction of oxygens; RF magnetrons; Thin-film transistor; X-ray photoelectron spectroscopies; Xps studies; ZnO; ZnO surfaces; Plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54249149438

Due to the European obligation to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the framework of the Kyoto Protocol, the trend toward natural gas is expected to continue in the future. The increased consumption is faced by comparably low indigenous gas resources within Europe, so that the dependency of Europe on gas imports from abroad will rise in the future. In addition to the existing supply sources Russia and Algeria, gas resources from the Middle East and the Caspian and the Central Asian regions may be supply options to cover Europe's gas demand in the future. Against this background, possible natural gas supply options as well as the transport infrastructure to and within Europe are discussed regarding their technical capacity and their costs. With the help of a cost-minimization model of the European gas supply system, the gas flows and the infrastructure capacity development up to the year 2030 are analyzed.

The quantum dots were investigated by photoluminescence spectroscopy to determine the emission wavelength and by capacitance-voltage spectroscopy to obtain information on the electron-electron interaction. With increasing post-growth annealing temperature, the emission blue-shifts and the ground state Coulomb energy decreases from 19.4 to 14.5 meV. This is consistent with the out-diffusion of In during the annealing step resulting in a larger quantum dot with reduced In content. In comparison with post-growth annealing, we have employed the so-called ""flush"" technique involving partial overgrowth to blue-shift the quantum dot emission. In this case, the ground state Coulomb energy is almost independent of the emission wavelength.

I begin by describing the importance of zooplankton in ocean ecosystems and the attributes that make them sensitive beacons of climate change. Global warming may have even greater repercussions for marine ecosystems than for terrestrial ecosystems, because temperature influences water column stability, nutrient enrichment, and the degree of new production, and thus the abundance, size composition, diversity, and trophic efficiency of zooplankton. Pertinent descriptions of physical changes in the ocean in response to climate change are given as a prelude to a detailed discussion of observed impacts of global warming on zooplankton. These manifest as changes in the distribution of individual species and assemblages, in the timing of important life-cycle events, and in abundance and community structure. The most illustrative case studies, where climate has had an obvious, tangible impact on zooplankton and substantial ecosystem consequences, are presented. Changes in the distribution and phenology of zooplankton are faster and greater than those observed for terrestrial groups. Relevant projected changes in ocean conditions are then presented, followed by an exploration of potential future changes in zooplankton communities from the perspective of different modelling approaches. Researchers have used a range of modelling approaches on individual species and functional groups forced by output from climate models under future greenhouse gas emission scenarios. I conclude by suggesting some potential future directions in climate change research for zooplankton, viz. the use of richer zooplankton functional groups in ecosystem models; greater research effort in tropical systems; investigating climate change in conjunction with other human impacts; and a global zooplankton observing system. © 2008 The Author(s).","Climate change; Climate variability; Distribution; Global change; Global warming; Phenology; Zooplankton","anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate variation; community response; ecosystem modeling; functional group; global change; global warming; phenology; spatial distribution; temperature effect; zooplankton",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649164407

The purpose was to find photochemically activated reducing agents for carbon dioxide that could be regenerated in a separate photochemical reaction. The calculations have revealed two reactions that might be suitable for this purpose. In one, the nitrogen of the radical cation makes a bond to a remote carbon with simultaneous displacement of a hydrogen atom. In the other, a remote hydrogen atom is transferred to the nitrogen, thereby creating a distonic radical cation that can lose a hydrogen atom β to the radical site. The latter reaction is found to be particularly favorable since it apparently involves a surface crossing that allows the amine radical cation and CO 2 radical anion to transform smoothly to a ground-state formate ion and an alkene. A number of structural motifs are investigated for the amines. The lower ionization potential of aromatic amines, compared to their aliphatic analogues, is desirable in that it could permit the use of longer wavelength light to drive the reaction. However, a thermochemical cycle shows that the reduction in ionization potential must be matched by an increase in proton affinity of the amine if the intramolecular hydrogen transfer is to be exothermic. Most aromatic amines do not satisfy this criterion and, hence, would have to rely on the displacement reaction for hydrogen-atom release if they were to be used as renewable reagents for CO2 reduction. Examples of specific aromatic and aliphatic tertiary amines that should be suitable for the purpose are presented, and their relative merits and weaknesses are discussed. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Activation analysis; Amines; Density functional theory; Photochemical reactions; Positive ions; Aliphatic tertiary amines; Amine radical cations; Remote C-H activation; Carbon dioxide; amine; carbon dioxide; article; chemical bond; chemical reaction kinetics; chemical structure; density functional theory; hydrogen bond; ionization; photochemistry; reduction kinetics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41449092742

Disagreements in paleoclimate interpretations, and diverse results from the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report future climate model simulations suggest that this uncertainty is still a factor of 2 in both latitude regimes. Cloud cover is the primary reason for model discrepancies at low latitudes, while snow/sea ice differences along with cloud cover affect the high-latitude response. While these uncertainties obviously affect our ability to predict future climate-change impacts in the tropics and polar regions directly, the uncertainty in latitudinal temperature gradient changes affects projections of future atmospheric dynamics, including changes in the tropical Hadley cell, midlatitude storms, and annual oscillation modes, with ramifications for regional climates. In addition, the uncertainty extends to the patterns of sea surface temperature changes, with, for example, no consensus concerning longitudinal gradient changes within each of the tropical oceans. We now know a good deal more about how latitudinal and longitudinal gradients affect regional climates; we just do not know how these gradients will change. New satellite observations and field programs are underway, which should help improve our modeling capability, although there is no guarantee that these issues will be resolved before a substantial global warming impact is upon us.

The reverse intersystem crossing from the triplet state back to the singlet system is achieved by photoexcitation to higher-excited triplet states, which are, however, prone to photobleaching. We gain insights into the competing pathways of ReISC and photobleaching. The relative efficiencies of these two pathways and the triplet lifetime determine the achievable fluorescence enhancement, which varies strongly with the choice of dye, excitation irradiance and wavelength, and with environmental conditions.

An approach is therefore needed to evaluate the quality of data from RCMs used for these purposes, to identify systematic errors and adjust future projected estimates accordingly. The present study uses a simple downscaling approach for recalibrating RCM estimates of precipitation, maximum and minimum air temperature (Tmax and Tmin), and solar radiation. We compared the Hadley Centre HadRM3 RCM-hindcast estimates for 1960 to 1990 with observed data from 15 meteorological stations in the UK. Downscaling factors (DFs) were applied to improve the match between hindcast and observed data. The DFs were then applied to the RCM data for the A2 2070 to 2100 scenario, assuming that the systematic deviations present in the hindcast estimates will persist. The hindcast RCM data included a considerable excess of small (<0.3 mm) precipitation events, whilst significantly overestimating the mean annual total at some sites and underestimating it at others. Estimates of Tmax were closer than for Tmin, which the model tended to overestimate by an average of 1°C. Estimates of lower Tmax and upper Tmin values were generally good, but the model was less effective in representing extreme warm and cold conditions. The model systematically overestimated solar radiation. Because the use of DF substantially improves the fit of hindcast estimates with observed data, their use with RCM projections should considerably increase confidence in model outputs for studies on impacts, mitigation and adaptation. © Inter-Research 2008.","Adaptation; Climate change; Downscaling; Evaluation; Precipitation; RCM; Solar radiation; Temperature","Atmospheric temperature; Climate change; Climatology; Precipitation (meteorology); Solar radiation; Systematic errors; air temperature; climate change; climate modeling; downscaling; hindcasting; precipitation (climatology); solar radiation; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44249122663

Maintaining current levels of soil C and/or sequestering additional C in soils are important mechanisms to reduce CO2 in the atmosphere through production agriculture. We conducted a study in northern Alabama from 2003 to 2006 to measure CO2 efflux and C storage in long-term tilled and non-tilled cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) plots receiving poultry litter or ammonium nitrate (AN). Treatments were established in 1996 on a Decatur silt loam (clayey, kaolinitic thermic, Typic Paleudults) and consisted of conventional-tillage (CT), mulch-tillage (MT), and no-tillage (NT) systems with winter rye [Secale cereale (L.)] cover cropping and AN and poultry litter (PL) as nitrogen sources. Cotton was planted in 2003, 2004, and 2006. Corn was planted in 2005 as a rotation crop using a no-till planter in all plots, and no fertilizer was applied. Poultry litter application resulted in higher CO 2 emission from soil compared with AN application regardless of tillage system. In 2003 and 2006, CT (4.39 and 3.40 μmol m-2 s-1, respectively) and MT (4.17 and 3.39 μmol m-2 s-1, respectively) with PL at 100 kg N ha-1 (100 PLN) recorded significantly higher CO, efflux compared with NT with 100 PLN (2.84 and 2.47 μmol m-2 s-1 respectively). Total soil C at 0- to 15-cm depth was not affected by tillage but significantly increased with PL application and winter rye cover cropping. In general, cotton produced with NT conservation tillage in conjunction with PL and winter rye cover cropping reduced CO2 emissions and sequestered more soil C compared with control treatments.

Usually rice hull is burned at the fields generating small silica particles that may cause respiratory and environmental damage. On the other hand, β-Ca2SiO4 is the second most important component of commercial portland cement. The utilization of β-Ca2SiO4 brings many environmental benefits, such as reduction of carbon dioxide emissions and the saving of raw materials and energy. This work describes the synthesis of β-Ca2SiO4 and related cements prepared from rice hull and the insertion of heavy metals (copper and cadmium). The insertion of these metals, chemically bounded to dicalcium silicate may represent a useful method to permanent encapsulation of hazardous chemicals. Silica was obtained from burning rice hull at 600 °C. The synthesis was carried out by a combination of sonochemical and solid-state chemical reactions and is completed at 800 °C. It was found that copper and cadmium can be inserted into β-Ca2SiO4 structure in proportions up to 10%. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

For that purpose, we employ a state-of-the-art panel stationarity test which incorporates multiple shifts in level and slope, thereby controlling for cross-sectional dependence through bootstrap methods. Our analysis renders clear-cut evidence that per capita GDP levels are nonstationary for the world as a whole while per capita CO2 is found to be regime-wise trend stationary. The analysis of country-groups shows that for Africa and Asia, per capita CO2 is best described as nonstationary, while per capita GDP appears stationary around a broken trend. In addition, we find evidence of regime-wise trend stationarity in both variables for the country-groups consisting of America, Europe and Oceania. The results of our analysis carry important implications for the statistical modelling of the Environmental Kuznets curve for CO2, since the differing order of integration in both variables for the world as a whole and for Africa and Asia calls into question the validity of panel cointegration techniques which assume that both variables are nonstationary and cointegrated with one another. Cointegration techniques would not be appropriate either for the case of America, Europe and Oceania which are characterised by per capita GDP and CO2 emissions being stationary around a broken trend. Similar conclusions are reached when we analyse country-groups based on levels of development. Failure to properly characterise the time series properties of the data by not controlling for an unknown number of structural breaks and for cross-sectional dependence could be responsible for the fragility and lack of robustness surrounding the estimation of environmental Kuznets curves. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Fish farms are particularly concerned, but legislation covering effluent discharge varies significantly from country to country. However, recommendations and directives from institutional, national or regional bodies suggest the enforcement of increasingly strict waste reduction measures and the development of waste treatment. Before treatment, it is necessary to evaluate waste production in terms of composition and quantity. The waste quantification methods used today for fish culture systems are either based on direct measurements of nutrient and suspended solid fluxes or on indirect evaluation based on the digestibility coefficients of the feed constituents. The objective of the present study is to evaluate the waste of a freshwater flow through farm using both approaches and to discuss their applicability, drawbacks and advantages from the viewpoints of fish farmers and control authorities. Waste production on the farm was monitored during several 24 hour cycles in order to characterise the effluents of the system. The predictions and measurements for the total nitrogen (TN) parameter were well correlated, but measured and predicted suspended solids (SS) and total phosphorus (TP) values presented a weaker correlation coefficient. The hydrobiological method gives details on the N and P forms of waste but this method is heavy and it is difficult to obtain representative samples and flow rate measurements. The nutritional method is the simplest to use, provided that feed data are available. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

During this migration process, they may face absolute boundaries to dispersal because of external environmental factors. Consequently, not only the position, but also the shape of the climate envelope can be modified. We use a reaction-diffusion model to analyse the effects on population persistence of simultaneous changes in the position and shape of the climate envelope. When the growth term is of logistic type, we show that extinction and persistence are principally conditioned by the species mobility and the speed of climate change, but not by the shape of the climate envelope. However, with a growth term taking an Allee effect into account, we find a high sensitivity to variations in the shape of the climate envelope. In this case, the species which have a high mobility, although they could more easily follow the migration of the climate envelope, would be at risk of extinction when encountering a local narrowing of the boundary geometry. This effect can be attenuated by a progressive opening at the exit of the narrowing into the available space, even though this leads temporarily to a diminished area of the climate envelope. © 2008 The Society of Population Ecology and Springer.","Biodiversity; Climate envelope; Conservation; Mobility; Reaction-diffusion; Single species model","Allee effect; climate change; extinction risk; migration; mobility; persistence; population growth; population modeling; species conservation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41049100658

Although rapid effects of PM2.5 exposure on the cardiovascular system have been proposed, few studies have investigated the effect of short-term exposures on out-of-hospital cardiac arrest (OHCA). Objective: We aimed to determine whether short-term PM2.5 exposures increased the risk of OHCA and whether risk depended on subject characteristics or presenting heart rhythm. Methods: A case-crossover analysis determined hazard ratios (HRs) for OHCAs logged by emergency medical systems (EMS) versus hourly and daily PM2.5 exposures at the time of the OHCA and for daily and hourly periods before it. Results: For all OHCAs (n = 1,374), exposures on the day of the arrest or 1-3 days before arrest had no significant effect on the incidence of OHCA. For cardiac arrests witnessed by bystanders (n = 511), 10-μm/m3 risk significantly increased with PM2.5 exposure, during the hour of the arrest (HR for a 10-μm/m3 increase in PM2.5 exposure = 1.12; 95% confidence interval, 1.01-1.25). For the subsets of subjects who were white, 60-75 years of age, or presented with asystole, OHCA risk significantly increased with PM2.5 during the hour of the arrest (HRs for a 10-μm/m3 increase in PM2.5 = 1. 18, 1.25, or 1.22, respectively-, p &lt; 0.05). HR generally decreased as the time lag between PM2.5 exposure and OHCA increased. Conclusion: The results suggest an acute effect of short-term PM2.5 exposure in precipitating OHCAs, and a need to investigate further the role of subject factors in the effects of PM on the risk of OHCA.","Air pollution; Cardiac arrest; Cardiovascular system; Case-crossover; EMS; Environmental health; Out-of-hospital; Particulate matter","adult; age distribution; aged; air pollution; article; asystole; cardiovascular risk; Caucasian; emergency health service; environmental exposure; environmental health; female; health hazard; heart arrest; heart rhythm; heart ventricle fibrillation; heart ventricle tachycardia; human; incidence; major clinical study; male; particulate matter; priority journal; race difference; United States; Aged; Air Pollutants; Cardiovascular System; Cross-Over Studies; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Heart Arrest; Humans; Indiana; Male; Middle Aged; Particle Size; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45749157174

Without extending wastewater treatment to all urban areas worldwide, CO2 and CH4 emissions associated with wastewater discharges could reach the equivalent of 1.91 × 105 tCO2 d- 1 in 2025, with even more dramatic impact in the short-term. The carbon sequestration benefits of wastewater treatment have enormous potential, which adds an energy conservation incentive to upgrading existing facilities to complete wastewater treatment. The potential greenhouse gases discharges which can be converted to a net equivalent CO2 credit can be as large as 1.21 × 104 tCO2 d- 1 by 2025. Biomass sequestration and biogas conversion energy recovery are the two main strategies for carbon sequestration and emission offset, respectively. The greatest potential for improvement is outside Europe and North America, which have largely completed treatment plant construction. Europe and North America can partially offset their CO2 emissions and receive benefits through the carbon emission trading system, as established by the Kyoto protocol, by extending existing technologies or subsidizing wastewater treatment plant construction in urban areas lacking treatment. This strategy can help mitigate global warming, in addition to providing a sustainable solution for extending the health, environmental, and humanitarian benefits of proper sanitation. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The CH2/CH3 ratios inferred from the infrared data are greater than those seen in organics in the diffuse interstellar medium, possibly indicating the presence of longer or less branched aliphatic chains. The micro-Raman data offer insights into the state of the order of the carbonaceous component present in the particles. Raman parameters for most of the particles span a similar range to that observed in interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) and the most primitive meteorites. Both the IR and Raman data imply the presence of a very labile carbonaceous component. Hydrated silicates may be present in two particles of Track 35, one of which may also contain carbonates, but further investigations with other techniques need to be performed to confirm these findings.

A dynamic approach to this question should also be possible by studying under field conditions how the δ13C of carbonates changes as organic matter decomposes. No such study has been undertaken owing to the slowness of the changes in the δ13C of carbonates, since it has been calculated that a detectable change will occur only after millenia. Nevertheless, this may not be true where soil CO2 efflux is intense, as expected in soil zones with high microbial activity. In this paper we test the latter assumption by incubating mixtures of plant material and carbonate-rich red earth in the field at depths of 5, 20 and 40 cm. Four types of plant material were tested: Medicago sativa, Eucalyptus globulus, Quercus ilex and Pinus halepensis. Because the isotopic composition of these plant materials is known, we can determine the isotopic composition of the respired C and study how it relates to the (expected) changes in the δ13C. After two years of field incubation, the changes in δ13C of carbonates were high enough to be reliably detected and quantified, thus showing that the isotopic composition of soil carbonates can change quite rapidly in biologically active soil horizons. The observed changes are possible only if we assume that the increase in δ13C in the overall path respired C → pedogenic carbonate is much higher than the usually applied standard factors (about 15‰). These enrichments can be explained by assuming, as does the currently accepted paradigm, that the precipitation of new carbonates occurs in an open system in which the penetration of free-air CO2 plays a major role. On the other hand, these enrichments can also be explained by an alternative interpretation, which assumes that the dissolution-precipitation carbonate cycles occur in systems that can be at least temporarily closed. Thus, we suggest that both possibilities (carbonate dissolution and precipitation in either an open or closed system) can coexist in a given soil, even though one or the other will dominate in any given time period. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In these strains, high levels of CreA are present whether cells are grown in repressing or derepressing conditions, indicating large-scale degradation of CreA does not play a key role. CreA is located in the nucleus and cytoplasm in cells when grown in either repressing or derepressing conditions, and absence of CreB, CreD or AcrB does not affect either the localisation or amount of CreA.

Such emissions are being released from diverse anthropogenic actions including industrial and commercial processes, and urban and production activities. It has been established that almost 90% of human health risks associated to fish consumption are due to Hg contaminated fish. With the aim of giving an overview on the Hg levels in the edible portion of fish of dietary importance, fish with different feeding habits from six locations in Sinaloa State (Mexico) were analyzed. Analyses of Hg were made by cold vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometry (CV-AAS). The highest concentrations of Hg (3.32 μg g-1 dry weight) in muscle tissue were found in the Pacific crevalle jack Caranx caninus (carnivorous) from Topolobampo lagoon. In general, it was found that Hg levels in muscle tissue were higher in carnivorous than in non-carnivorous fish. Special attention should be paid to those species whose average Hg content is close to the acceptable limit (like C. caninus from Topolobampo bay), since this species is widely consumed in the human diet on the Mexican coasts. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

In this direction, modeling studies have used Supersites-related data and are reviewed here. Fine temporal resolution data have been used both to test model components (e.g., the inorganic thermodynamic routines) and air quality modeling systems (in particular, Community Multiscale Air Quality [CMAQ] and Comprehensive Air Quality Model with extensions [CAMx] applications). Such evaluations suggest that the inorganic thermodynamic approaches being used are accurate, as well as the description of sulfate production, although there are significant uncertainties in production of nitric acid, biogenic and ammonia emissions, secondary organic aerosol formation, and the ability to follow the formation and evolution of ultrafine particles. Model applications have investigated how PM levels will respond to various emissions controls, suggesting that nitrate will replace some of the reductions in sulfate particulate matter (PM), although the replacement is small in the summer. Although not part of the Supersite program, modeling being conducted by EPA, regional planning organizations, and states for policy purposes has benefited from the detailed data collected, and the PM models have advanced by their more widespread use.

In this paper, an integrated assessment approach is employed to discuss the social desirability of a large-scale biodiesel production in Italy, taking into account social, environmental and economic factors. The conclusion is that the advantages in terms of reduction of greenhouse gas emissions, energy dependency and urban pollution would be very modest. The small benefits would not be enough to offset the huge costs in terms of land requirement: if the target of the European Directive 2003/30/EC were reached (5.75% of the energy used for transport by 2010) the equivalent of about one-third of the Italian agricultural land would be needed. The consequences would be a considerable increase in food imports and large environmental impacts in the agricultural phase. Also, since biodiesel must be de-taxed in order to make it competitive with oil-derived diesel, the Italian energy revenues would be reduced. In the end, rural development remains the only sound reason to promote biodiesel, but even for this objective other strategies look more advisable, like supporting organic agriculture. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The paper presents the results of an analysis of the implications for technology choice, generation capacity, energy reliability, and cost to ratepayers of that decision, combining a national electricity market model with a regional model that includes market power and an economic impact model.

Results indicate that Tokyo's regulations cut exhaust particulate emissions from diesel-powered trucks and buses registered in Tokyo by 17% and 31% in 2003 and 2004 through the promotion of diesel particulate filters and oxidation catalysts and by accelerating fleet turnover. Modest emission reductions were also observed for nitrogen oxides.

Control of indoor pests is currently dealt with locally, and control strategies seldom include different mills or cooperative industries in joint efforts to reduce infestations. In colder climates where conditions hinder flight dispersal of stored-product moths, we hypothesize that human transport between mills will facilitate dispersal. Albeit considered intuitive, this hypothesis has so far never been tested. Male moths from three mills (populations) in southern Sweden and Denmark were collected and by using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) pair-wise F st values were calculated. Cluster (population) origins of the genotypes were computed by using a model-based method, structure. The results suggest that known transportation of flour between two mills generate genetically more similar populations of the economically important stored-product moth, Ephestia kuehniella (Zell.) (Lepidoptera; Pyralidae), compared to the third mill, with another distribution area, but situated geographically in between the other mills. The structure model placed the sampled genotypes to belong to either two or five original populations, with a higher probability of two original populations. The third mill was consistently different from the other two mills independent of the models' calculated number of populations. Although the study was restricted to three mills and one transportation route, it highlights the possibility that transportation of food products promotes genetic mixing (i.e. dispersal) of insect pest populations. Including cooperating mills in control (or monitor) strategy schemes against stored-product pest insects would therefore be a more effective action, rather than to treat each mill separately. © 2007 Springer-Verlag.","AFLP; Ephestia kuehniella; Gene flow; Lepidoptera; Population movements","anthropogenic effect; dispersal; gene flow; geographical distribution; mill; moth; movement; pest control; pest outbreak; transport process; amplified fragment length polymorphism; animal experiment; anthropology; article; calculation; cold climate; controlled study; Denmark; flour; food processing; gene structure; genotype; geographic distribution; male; molecular biology; moth; nonhuman; pest control; population dispersal; stored product pest moth; Sweden; Amplified Fragment Length Polymorphism Analysis; Animals; Denmark; Flour; Food Handling; Humans; Moths; Pest Control, Biological; Sweden; Denmark; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden; Anagasta kuehniella; Hexapoda; Lepidoptera; Pyralidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38049054877

Carbon dioxide is the major GHG. To fulfil this obligation, the nations must meet the sustainability challenge of countering rising population plus affluence with the dematerialization of less energy per GDP plus the decarbonization of less carbon per energy. To test the feasibility of meeting the challenge, we analysed carbon dioxide emission during 1993-2004. Although emissions in the entire Union grew only by an average of 0.31% per year, emissions and their drivers varied markedly among the 27 member states. Dematerialization and decarbonization did occur, but not enough to offset the slight population growth plus rapidly increasing affluence. To fulfil its obligation in the next 12 years, the EU27 would have to counter its increasing population and affluence by a combined dematerialization and decarbonization 1.9-2.6 times faster than during 1993-2004.

We examined the effects of combinations of irrigation, tillage, cropping systems, and N fertilization on soil CO2 flux, temperature, water, and C content at the 0- to 20-cm depth from May to November 2005 at two sites in the northern Great Plains. Treatments were two irrigation systems (irrigated vs. non-irrigated) and six management practices that contained tilled and no-tilled malt barley (Hordeum vulgaris L.) with 0 to 134 kg N ha-1, no-tilled pea (Pisum sativum L.), and a conservation reserve program (CRP) planting applied in Lihen sandy loam (sandy, mixed, frigid, Entic Haplustolls) in western North Dakota. In eastern Montana, treatments were no-tilled malt barley with 78 kg N ha -1, no-tilled rye (Secale cereale L.), no-tilled Austrian winter pea, no-tilled fallow, and tilled fallow applied in dryland Williams loam (fine-loamy, mixed Typic Argiborolls). Irrigation increased CO2 flux by 13% compared with non-irrigation by increasing soil water content in North Dakota. Tillage increased CO2 flux by 62 to 118% compared with no-tillage at both places. The flux was 1.5- to 2.5-fold greater with tilled than with non-tilled treatments following heavy rain or irrigation in North Dakota and 1.5- to 2.0-fold greater with crops than with fallow following substantial rain in Montana. Nitrogen fertilization increased CO2 flux by 14% compared with, no N fertilization in North Dakota and cropping increased the flux by 79% compared with fallow in no-till and 0 kg N ha -1 in Montana. The CO2 flux in undisturbed CRP was similar to that in no-tilled crops. Although soil C content was not altered, management practices influenced CO2 flux within a short period due to changes in soil temperature, water, and nutrient contents. Regardless of irrigation, CO2 flux can be reduced from croplands to a level similar to that in CRP planting using no-tilled crops with or without N fertilization compared with other management practices.

This in vitro cell lung model is closer to the normal in vivo situation than other lung cell lines, notably in the characteristics that AM display in terms of gene expression of phase I and phase II-metabolizing enzymes. The bronchoscopic examinations and BAL procedures were carried out without any complications. After 24, 48 and 72 h of incubation, calculated lethal concentrations at 10% and 50% of collected airborne PM were 14.93 μg PM/mL and 74.63 μg PM/mL, respectively, and indicated the higher sensibility of such target lung cells. Moreover, VOC and/or PAH coated onto PM induced gene expression of cytochrome P450 (cyp) 1a1, cyp2e1, nadph quinone oxydo-reductase-1, and glutathione S-transferase-pi 1 and mu 3, versus controls, suggesting thereby the formation of biologically reactive metabolites. In addition, these results suggested the role of physical carrier of carbonaceous core of PM, which can, therefore, increase both the penetration and the retention of attached-VOC into the cells, thereby enabling them to exert a longer induction. Hence, we concluded that the metabolic activation of the very low doses of VOC and/or PAH coated onto Dunkerque City's PM2.5 is one of the underlying mechanisms of action closely involved in its cytotoxicity in isolated human AM in culture. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Transformants were selected on a 100 mg l-1 Zeocin plate, and Zeocin-resistant clones were further selected by the occurrence of GUS activity. Two to 10 GUS-positive clones were obtained, and GUS activities in these transformants did not change in response to changes in ambient CO2 concentration except that the PRSV-LTR was weakly activated in air. These results indicate that a wide spectrum of viral promoters originating from mammalian, avian and plant hosts can operate as constitutive promoters in a marine diatom. The CO2 responsive promoter sequence of the chloroplastic carbonic anhydrase gene in P. tricornutum (Pptca1) with a deleted initiator region was ligated with the minimal region of the PCMV followed by uidA and was introduced into P. tricornutum. GUS expression in the resulting transformants was clearly regulated by CO2, that is, GUS expression was stimulated in air to about 10-fold than that in cells grown in 5% CO2. However, the CO 2 response disappeared when the core regulatory region of Pptca1 (-76 to -11 bp) was removed. The regulative function of the endogenous diatom promoter was thus maintained after fusion with an extrinsic viral promoter. These results indicate that diatom cells accommodate a wide range of transcriptional system from beyond the plant kingdom and that an efficient transcriptional system could potentially be constructed in marine diatoms by selecting an appropriate set of viral promoter and functional cis elements. © Physiologia Plantarum 2008.",,"beta glucuronidase; carbon dioxide; carbonate dehydratase; sea water; virus DNA; biological model; biology; Cauliflower mosaic virus; conference paper; Cytomegalovirus; diatom; gene expression; genetics; long terminal repeat; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; promoter region; Base Sequence; Carbon Dioxide; Carbonic Anhydrases; Caulimovirus; Cytomegalovirus; Diatoms; DNA, Viral; Gene Expression; Glucuronidase; Marine Biology; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Seawater; Terminal Repeat Sequences; Aves; Bacillariophyta; Cauliflower mosaic virus; Cytomegalovirus; Mammalia; Nitzschia alba; Papaya ringspot virus; Phaeodactylum tricornutum; Rous sarcoma virus",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42049109116

Ecosystems can also be thought of as energy transformers and nutrient processors. A diversity of ecosystems exist throughout the world and can be classified according to their functional groups and physical context. Insights into the structure and function of entire ecosystems can be revealed through whole ecosystem experiments, management experiments, and natural stable isotope analysis. Increasing threats to global biodiversity and accelerating rates of species extinction have prompted researchers to formally investigate the role of biodiversity in providing, maintaining, and even promoting ecosystem function. Several studies report a positive relationship between biodiversity and ecosystem function, yet, the generality of the results and the mechanisms driving them have provoked considerable debate and several counterexamples exist. Nonetheless, identifying the mechanisms governing ecosystem functioning is an important conservation priority given that ecosystems perform a diversity of services on which human civilization depends. Ecosystem services - such as water purification, pollination, climate regulation, and erosion control to name a few - are typically considered 'free' and thus easily squandered despite their importance and obvious economic value. Although the idea of paying for ecosystem services has been gaining momentum, assigning value to ecosystem services is a tricky task. With the increased recognition that almost all ecosystems have been profoundly altered by humans and that natural and social systems are inextricably linked, considering the feedbacks within coupled social-ecological systems has emerged as a critical concept in ecology, environmental and social science, and ecosystem management. Recognizing the need to sustain the integrity and resilience of social-ecological systems has led to calls for ecosystem-based management, a management approach that considers all ecosystem components, including humans and the physical environment. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

These nucleotides are the same for the proteins studied so far: bovine carbonic anhydrase, lactate dehydrogenase, malate dehydrogenase, and chicken egg white lysozyme. The amino acids that interact with these nucleotides are also found to be specific in the two cases tested: bovine carbonic anhydrase and lysozyme. They are either neutral or positively charged and are present in random coils on the surface of the crystal structure of both the proteins. In fact, two of these amino acid-nucleotide pairs are identical in the two cases. How these features might help the process of protein folding is discussed.

Two approaches have been generally used for it: equilibrium and kinetics. In the first case-equilibrium-methane reforming is considered to be fast enough to reach equilibrium. Contrarily, kinetics-based theories assume that the reforming reaction is very slow and does not reach equilibrium. In this case, a reforming rate equation is needed. Four cases are considered: one equilibrium model, two kinetics models and a mixed model. Results show that methane reforming does not follow a unique pattern along the anodic duct and a local detailed analysis is demanded. Furthermore, a mixed model must be used for multidimensional SOFC modelling, although equilibrium is globally satisfactory and, therefore, it is appropriate for 0-D models. © 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.","Equilibrium; Kinetics; Reforming; SOFC","Computer simulation; Mathematical models; Methane; Reforming reactions; 0-D models; Anodic duct; Kinetics-based theories; Methane reforming; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41549160212

Surface pressure-area isotherms suggest that mixtures containing 25.0-62.5-mol% DLPC (range of composition investigated) are phase-separated. The lateral structure of the DSPC/DLPC monolayers was imaged by Brewster angle microscopy (BAM) as a function of the surface pressure. Quasi-circular condensed domains appeared at pressures between 0 and 0.5 mN m-1, and these structures were already fully developed at ∼1 mN m-1. Further compression of the monolayers above 1 mN m-1 merely brought the domains closer together. The mixed monolayers consisted of solid domains of DSPC, ∼3-20 μm in size, in a fluid matrix of DLPC. BAM and the phase contrast mode of intermittent-contact atomic force microscopy (AFM) revealed that the quasi-circular DSPC domains are divided into segments of different reflectivities (BAM) or phase shift (AFM) that arise from abrupt changes in the long-range orientational order of the tilted hydrocarbon chains.

We seek to explain the peculiar behavior of these systems, especially with regard to the unfavorable mixing behavior. The methodology is based on discontinuous molecular dynamics (DMD) and second order thermodynamic perturbation theory (TPT). DMD simulation is applied to the repulsive part of the potential. The effects of disperse attractions and hydrogen bonding are treated by TPT, discretizing the attractive potential into four distinct wells of variable depth. This approach accelerates the molecular simulations in general and the parameterization of the transferable potentials in particular. C3-C8 straight chain perfluorocarbons are characterized along with perfluorobenzene, perfluorocyclobutane, and heptafluoropropane applying explicit atom models for all fluorine atoms. Each compound is simulated at 21 densities. Interpolation with density combines with TPT to give a complete equation of state. The depths of the attractive wells are optimized by iterating on their values until the vapor pressures computed by the resulting equation of state provide the minimum deviation from experimental data. Step potentials offer the prospect of setting the step depths without preconceived notions regarding the shape of the potential. In the case of perfluorocarbons, it is found that the minimum of the potential is reached at roughly 1.8σ, with the range from σ to 1.8σ acting as a soft ""shoulder"" region which is weakly attractive, where σ designates the site diameter. This shoulder region can explain the unusually low heat of vaporization of perfluorocarbons and high vapor pressures relative to compounds with similar molecular volume. Application of this approach results in average absolute deviations of 8% in vapor pressure and 3% in liquid density. Coincidentally, the soft shoulder also explains the weak mixture interactions between perfluorocarbons and n-alkanes. The Lorentz-Berthelot combining rule assumed to describe site-site interactions between corresponding steps leads to εijk ∼ (εiikεjjk)1/2, where εijk is the depth of the potential well between sites i and j in the kth step. For steps at short range, the alkane steps are at their deepest, but the perfluorocarbon interactions are weak, making the mixed interaction weak. For steps at long range, the perfluorocarbon steps are deeper, but the alkane interactions are weak, again making the mixed interaction weak. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

To determine the magnitude of this limitation within the United States (US), this study derives average atmospheric SF6 mixing ratios from soil air measurements from five major urban areas. All surveyed sites showed SF6 elevated above Northern Hemisphere clean air levels. In many cases, SF6 mixing ratios were highest within large cities, but significantly elevated levels persisted hundreds of kilometers beyond the urban centers. Estimated SF6 emissions from New York city were anomalously large, resulting in average levels over 200% above remote atmosphere values. Emissions from other urban areas included in this study appear to be typical for large cities in the US and maximum observed elevations of SF6, in these areas, were in the range of 50-100%. These findings imply that caution is needed in choosing an atmospheric input function when using SF6 as a transient tracer within or near urbanized regions. Within the Northeast US, the assumption of remote atmospheric SF6 may lead to significant errors in estimation of groundwater ages, especially in the case of an expected future flattening of the atmospheric mixing ratio curve. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

At shallow depth, we show the important heating (estimated to > 100 eV till 15 μm depth) has a resistive origin upon the neutralizing return current.

This investigation was conducted in a long-term experiment of warming and drought manipulation that began in 1999 and is lasting until now. Warming increased soil urease activity by 10% in the study period, mainly by increasing soil urease activity 30% in winter and 10% in spring, and increased β-glucosidase activity 38% in spring. Soil urease and β-glucosidase activities were positively correlated with soil temperatures in winter and negatively in summer. Warming increased soil enzyme activities in winter when soil moisture was highest and in spring coinciding with the greatest biological activity. Warming decreased NH4+ soil concentration in the spring of 2004 (by 30%) and 2005 (by 72%), in consonance with the increase in N uptake by plants. Warming decreased N concentration in Globularia alypum leaf litter, increasing C/N leaf ratio by 30% showing an increase in N mobilization and contributing to a greater total N accumulation in plants. However, the greater NO3- availability in soil observed under warming, probably by an increase in nitrification, may lead to a net N loss by leaching under the torrential rainfalls typical of the Mediterranean climate regions. Drought reduced soil protease activity (9%) in the study period, mainly by decreasing it in spring by 13-21%, but did not affect N soil contents because N turn-over reduction was counterbalanced by a decrease in N leaf concentrations. Soil protease activity was positively correlated with soil water content showing a strong dependence of this enzyme on soil water content. Drought did not affect β-glucosidase activity but tended to increase C contents in soils, which together with the increase in C/N in leaves indicate a reduction of C turn-over and a trend to increase C stocks in soil at long term. The effects of warming and drought on soil enzyme activities were due to a direct effect on soil temperature and soil water content, respectively, and not to changes on soil organic matter quantity and nutritional quality. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Disposal of CO2 from stationary sources into subsurface structures has been suggested as a possible means for reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. However, much remains to be done in the issues regarding the safety and reliability of CO2 geological sequestration. In this study, we have developed a simulation code by using the mathematical model of two phase flow in porous media to analyze the flow dynamics in the subsurface. The equation of state for CO2 covering the fluid region from the triple point to the supercritical region is employed to model the states of CO2 gas, liquid and supercritical state. The correct understanding of the CO2 state under the geological formation condition is an important factor to predict the injection pressure and CO2 fluid permeation because the fluid density has a great effect on the injection behavior. The numerical simulation was implemented under several geological conditions including gas, liquid and supercritical states to examine the optimal injection condition. Comparing the numerical results obtained using the equation of state for CO2 with those obtained using the ideal gas equation, it has been shown that the difference in the injection pressure appears to be significant near the condition of the critical point of CO2 and the phase equilibrium curves between the gas and liquid states. The numerical simulation has been implemented to examine the effect of the reservoir condition on the injection behavior. The injection pressure is decreased at the lower reservoir temperature and higher hydrostatic pressure condition. The CO2 permeation is also strongly affected by the reservoir condition, and the spatial CO2 saturation becomes higher with increasing reservoir temperature. It has been demonstrated that the simulation code developed in this study may be useful to provide knowledge required to select the reservoir condition for CO2 geological sequestration. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Aromatic hydrocarbons suppress the transcription of the growth hormone-regulated, male-specific rat hepatic cytochrome P450 2C11 gene (CYP2C11) in vivo via an unknown mechanism. We hypothesize that the suppression of CYP2C11 by aromatic hydrocarbons is mediated by the gene's promoter and 5′-flanking region. Following bioinformatic analysis of putative transcription factor (TF) binding sites, we cloned extended lengths of the CYP2C11 5′-flanking region into a promoterless luciferase plasmid. Suppression of CYP2C11 constructs was not observed upon treatment of transfected rat 5L, BP8 or mouse Hepa-1 cells with 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) or 3-methylcholanthrene. In human HepG2 cells, the 10.1-kb construct displayed a pronounced 6- to 8-fold induction by TCDD. Deletion analysis localized the paradoxical induction response to a region between -1.8 kb and -1.3 kb, which contains a dioxin-responsive element (DRE) previously shown by us to be capable of binding activated AHR. This was confirmed by site-directed mutagenesis of the DRE. Induction of the 10.1-kb construct by TCDD in HepG2 cells was blocked by α-naphthoflavone, an AHR antagonist/partial agonist. The AHR is likely involved in the induction of CYP2C11-luciferase activity by TCDD in HepG2 cells and this response is at least partly DRE-mediated.

Of particular interest is the carbon isotope content (δ13C) of nocturnal ecosystem-respired CO2 (δR). Recent advances in technology have made it possible to continuously examine the variation in δR within a forest canopy over relatively long time-scales (months-years). We used tunable diode laser spectroscopy to examine δR at within- and below-canopy spatial locations in a Colorado subalpine forest (the Niwot Ridge AmeriFlux site). We found a systematic pattern of increased δR within the forest canopy (δR-c) compared to that near the ground (δR-g). Values of δR-c were weakly correlated with the previous day's mean maximum daytime vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Conversely, there was a negative but still weak correlation between δR-g and time-lagged (0-5 days) daily mean soil moisture. The topography and presence of sustained nightly drainage flows at the Niwot Ridge forest site suggests that, on nights with stable atmospheric conditions, there is little mixing of air near the ground with that in the canopy. Atmospheric stability was assessed using thresholds of friction velocity, stability above the canopy, and bulk Richardson number within the canopy. When we selectively calculated δR-g and δR-c by removing time periods when ground and canopy air were well mixed, we found stronger correlations between δR-c and VPD, and δR-g and soil moisture. This suggests that there may be fundamental differences in the environmental controls on δR at sub-canopy spatial scales. These results may help explain the wide variance observed in the correlation of δR with different environmental parameters in other studies. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The fields were managed using different fertilizer management strategies and irrigation water regimes. N2O emissions varied widely between years, within 1 year throughout the vegetation season, and between the sites. The amount of irrigation water applied, the amount and type of N fertilizer used, and topsoil temperature had the greatest effect on these emissions. Very high N2O emissions of up to 3000 μg N2O-N m-2 h-1 were measured in periods following N-fertilizer application in combination with irrigation events. These ""emission pulses"" accounted for 80-95% of the total N2O emissions between April and September and varied from 0.9 to 6.5 kg N2O-N ha-1.. Emission factors (EF), uncorrected for background emission, ranged from 0.4% to 2.6% of total N applied, corresponding to an average EF of 1.48% of applied N fertilizer lost as N2O-N. This is in line with the default global average value of 1.25% of applied N used in calculations of N2O emissions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. During the emission pulses, which were triggered by high soil moisture and high availability of mineral N, a clear diurnal pattern of N2O emissions was observed, driven by daily changes in topsoil temperature. For these periods, air sampling from 8:00 to 10:00 and from 18:00 to 20:00 was found to best represent the mean daily N2O flux rates. The wet topsoil conditions caused by irrigation favored the production of N2O from NO3- fertilizers, but not from NH4+ fertilizers, thus indicating that denitrification was the main process causing N2O emissions. It is therefore argued that there is scope for reducing N2O emission from irrigated cotton production; i.e. through the exclusive use of NH4+ fertilizers. Advanced application and irrigation techniques such as subsurface fertilizer application, drip irrigation and fertigation may also minimize N2O emission from this regionally dominant agro-ecosystem. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This requires an unprecedented degree of international action for emission reductions and technological change in the energy sector. Extending the established optimal control approach, the paper combines the concepts of adaptive control, inverse modeling and local optimization to climate change decision-making and management. An alternative decision model is described where controls are adjusted towards a moving target under changing conditions. A framework for integrated assessment is introduced, where a basic climate model is coupled to an economic production function with energy as a production factor, which is controlled by the allocation of investments to alternative energy technologies. Investment strategies are shaped by value functions, including utility, costs and climate damages for a given future time horizon, which are translated into admissible emission limits to keep atmospheric carbon concentrations and global mean temperature asymptotically below a given threshold. Conditions for switching between management and technology paths with different costs and carbon intensities are identified. To take account of the substantial uncertainties, an exemplary case discusses the sensitivity of the results to variation of crucial parameters, in particular time discounting, climate damage, taxes and time horizon for decision-making. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41749125455

As a consequence, the spatial distributions of tree species will expand or contract at differential rates. In addition, human fragmentation of the landscape may limit effective seed dispersal, and inter-specific competition may limit the migration of climate-adapted species, restraining the rate of tree species migration. If the northward migration of tree species adapted to a warmer climate lags behind the rate of climatic change, overall growth rates and aboveground biomass of northern forests may be significantly reduced relative to their potential. We used a spatially interactive forest landscape model, LANDIS-II, that simulates tree species establishment, growth, mortality, succession, and disturbance. We simulated multiple scenarios of disturbance and climatic change across a ∼15 000 km2 forested landscape in northwestern Wisconsin, USA. These simulations were used to estimate changes in aboveground live biomass and the spatial distribution of 22 tree species. We observed a reduction in aboveground live biomass relative to the potential biomass for the combined soils and changing climate. We regressed the reduction of potential aboveground biomass against a measure of fragmentation, the initial biomass for 22 tree species, and soil water holding capacity calculated at 3 spatial resolutions. We also regressed the range expansion of 3 individual tree species that are expected to expand their distributions against the same variables. Species migration and range expansion were negatively correlated with fragmentation both in total and for 2 of the 3 species examined in detail. The initial abundances of some tree species were also significant predictors of species migration and range expansion and indicate significant competition between existing species assemblages and more southerly species that are expected to migrate north. In conclusion, the above-ground biomass of northern forests may be limited by interactions among climate change, interspecific competition, and fragmentation. © Inter-Research 2008.","Carbon storage; Climate change; Forest fragmentation; Interspecific competition; LANDIS-II; Tree species migration; Tree species range expansion","Biomass; Climate change; Forestry; Population dynamics; aboveground biomass; climate change; climate effect; growth rate; habitat fragmentation; interspecific competition; migration; mortality; range expansion; regression analysis; remote sensing; reproductive success; spatial distribution; tree; North America; United States; Wisconsin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-48749099858

Utility is defined herein as net forecast dependabilities of at least 50%, where net dependability is the product of the large-scale 3-month forecast dependability with a factor accounting for losses in dependability due to the higher spatiotemporal variability of 1-month station data. This loss factor is estimated from station data by computing the frequency of matching sign (FOMS) between the direction of departures from average of 3-month forecast division values and 1-month station values, for average temperature and precipitation, over a 10-year study period and 96 stations in six regions of the U.S. The resulting FOMS does not display any consistent differences across regions, locations, or months, so is averaged across all months and stations. Average FOMS calculated in this manner are 76% for average temperature and 66% for total precipitation. The decimal FOMS are then used as the multiplicative loss factor on previously reported 3-month forecast division reliability values to produce estimates of the net reliability for downscaled forecasts at locations within each forecast division. The resulting guidance is dependent on region and forecast variable, with the forecasts for above-average temperature emerging as worthy of consideration for use in agricultural applications over the majority of the contiguous U.S. The Northeast, the Great Lakes, parts of the Northern Great Plains, interior California, and northwest Nevada are the only regions with insufficient net dependability to preclude immediate consideration. Conversely, forecasts for cooler than average temperature do not retain sufficient net dependability after downscaling to be an attractive option in any part of the contiguous U.S. at this time. Forecasts for wetter or drier than average conditions retained sufficient net dependability to encourage further development over only about 10% of the contiguous U.S., in regions well-known to experience the strongest ENSO impacts on precipitation. The forecast divisions where agricultural decision support might benefit from NOAAICPC seasonal precipitation forecasts are located in Florida, south Texas, southwest New Mexico, Arizona, central and southern California, and parts of Oregon, Washington, Idaho, and Montana. © 2008 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Agricultural management; Average air temperature; Climate; Climatology; Decision support; Downscaling; Forecast; Precipitation; Seasonal","Agricultural applications; Agricultural management; Agricultural planning; Arizona; Average air temperature; Average temperatures; California; Climate; Climatology; Crop modeling; Crop production; Decision support; Decision supports; Downscaling; Florida; Forecast; Great Lakes; Loss factors; Montana; New Mexico; Northern great plains; Precipitation; Seasonal; Seasonal climate forecasts; Seasonal precipitations; Southern california; Spatio-temporal variability; Total precipitation; Washington; Crops; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Estimation; Planning; Weather forecasting; Forecasting; agricultural management; air temperature; crop production; decision support system; downscaling; NOAA satellite; precipitation assessment; temperature profile; weather forecasting; weather station; California; Great Plains; Nevada; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49549084155

The device is a hybrid between a diode and a field-effect transistor. Compared to conventional OLEDs, the metallic cathode is displaced by one to several micrometers from the light-emitting zone. This micrometer-sized distance can be bridged by electrons with enhanced field-effect mobility. The device is fabricated using poly(triarylamine) (PTAA) as the hole-transport material, tris(8-hydroxyquinoline) aluminum (Alq3) doped with 4-(dicyanomethylene)-2-methyl-6-(julolindin-4-yl-vinyl)-4H-pyran (DCM 2) as the active light-emitting layer, and N,N′- ditridecylperylene-3,4,9,10-tetracarboxylic diimide (PTCDI-C13H 27), as the electron-transport material. The obtained external quantum efficiencies are as high as for conventional OLEDs comprising the same materials. The quantum efficiencies of the new devices are remarkably independent of the current, up to current densities of more than 10 A cm -2. In addition, the absence of a metallic cathode covering the light-emission zone permits top-emission and could reduce optical absorption losses in waveguide structures. These properties may be useful in the future for the fabrication of solid-state high-brightness organic light sources. © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

A modified version of the revised Morgan-Morgan-Finney erosion model was used to assess soil losses in one conventional and three conservation tillage systems. The model was employed to a climatic reference scenario (1960-89) and a climate change scenario (2070-99). Data on precipitation changes for the 2070-99 scenario were based on the IPCC SRES A2 emission scenario as simulated by the regional climate model HadRM3H. Weather data in daily time-steps, for both scenarios, were generated by the stochastic weather generator LARS WG 3.0. The HadRM3H climate change simulation did not show any significant differences in annual precipitation totals, but strong seasonal shifts of rainfall amounts between 10 and 14% were apparent. This intra-annual precipitation change resulted in a net-decrease of rainfall amounts in erosion sensitive months and an overall increase of rainfall in a period, in which the considered agricultural area proved to be less prone to erosion. The predicted annual average soil losses under climate change declined in all tillage systems by 11 to 24%, which is inside the margins of uncertainty typically attached to climate change impact studies. Annual soil erosion rates in the conventional tillage system exceeded 10 t ha- 1 a- 1 in both climate scenarios. Compared to these unsustainably high soil losses the conservation tillage systems show reduced soil erosion rates by between 49 and 87%. The study highlights the importance of seasonal changes in climatic parameters for the discussion about the impacts of global climate change on future soil erosion rates in Central Europe. The results also indicate the high potential of adaptive land-use management for climate change response strategies in the agricultural sector. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The purpose of this study was to examine the potential shifts in spatial distribution of three tree-line conifer species in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem under three future climate-change scenarios and to assess their potential sensitivity to changes in both temperature and precipitation. Location: This study was performed using data from 275 sites within the boundaries of Yellowstone and Grand Teton national parks, primarily located in Wyoming, USA. Methods: We used data on tree-line conifer presence from the US Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis Program. Climatic and edaphic variables were derived from spatially interpolated maps and approximated for each of the sites. We used the random-forest prediction method to build a model of predicted current and future distributions of each of the species under various climate-change scenarios. Results: We had good success in predicting the distribution of tree-line conifer species currently and under future climate scenarios. Temperature and temperature-related variables appeared to be most influential in the distribution of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), whereas precipitation and soil variables dominated the models for subalpine fir (Abies lasiocarpa) and Engelmann spruce (Picea engelmannii). The model for whitebark pine substantially overpredicted absences (as compared with the other models), which is probably a result of the importance of biological factors in the distribution of this species. Main conclusions: These models demonstrate the complex response of conifer distributions to changing climate scenarios. Whitebark pine is considered a 'keystone' species in the subalpine forests of western North America; however, it is believed to be nearly extinct throughout a substantial portion of its range owing to the combined effects of an introduced pathogen, outbreaks of the native mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae), and changing fire regimes. Given predicted changes in climate, it is reasonable to predict an overall decrease in pine-dominated subalpine forests in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. In order to manage these forests effectively with respect to future climate, it may be important to focus attention on monitoring dry mid- and high-elevation forests as harbingers of long-term change. © 2007 The Authors.","Biophysical variables; Climate change; Climate variability; Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem; Pinus albicaulis; Random forest model; Species distribution; Tree-line conifer distributions","beetle; bioclimatology; biophysics; climate change; coniferous tree; forest inventory; keystone species; pathogen; spatial distribution; species conservation; treeline; Grand Teton National Park; Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem; North America; United States; Wyoming; Abies; Abies lasiocarpa; Coleoptera; Coniferophyta; Dendroctonus ponderosae; Picea; Picea engelmannii; Pinus albicaulis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40749089976

Following to the 2006 climate summit, the European Union formally set the goal of limiting global warming to 2 degrees Celsius. But even today, climate change is already affecting people and ecosystems. Examples are melting glaciers and polar ice, reports about thawing permafrost areas, dying coral reefs, rising sea levels, changing ecosystems and fatal heat periods. Within the last 150 years, CO2 levels rose from 280 ppm to currently over 400 ppm. If we continue on our present course, CO2 equivalent levels could approach 600 ppm by 2035. However, if CO2 levels are not stabilized at the 450-550 ppm level, the consequences could be quite severe. Hence, if we do not act now, the opportunity to stabilise at even 550 ppm is likely to slip away. Long-term stabilisation will require that CO2 emissions ultimately be reduced to more than 80% below current levels. This will require major changes in how we operate. Results. Reducing greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels seems to be the most promising approach to counterbalance the dramatic climate changes we would face in the near future. It is clear since the Kyoto protocol that the availability of fossil carbon resources will not match our future requirements. Furthermore, the distribution of fossil carbon sources around the globe makes them an even less reliable source in the future. We propose to screen crop and non-crop species for high biomass production and good survival on marginal soils as well as to produce mutants from the same species by chemical mutagenesis or related methods. These plants, when grown in adequate crop rotation, will provide local farming communities with biomass for the fermentation in decentralized biogas reactors, and the resulting nitrogen rich manure can be distributed on the fields to improve the soil. Discussion. Such an approach will open new economic perspectives to small farmers, and provide a clever way to self sufficient and sustainable rural development. Together with the present economic reality, where energy and raw material prices have drastically increased over the last decade, they necessitate the development and the establishment of alternative concepts. Conclusions. Biotechnology is available to apply fast breeding to promising energy plant species. It is important that our valuable arable land is preserved for agriculture. The opportunity to switch from low-income agriculture to biogas production may convince small farmers to adhere to their business and by that preserve the identity of rural communities. Perspectives. Overall, biogas is a promising alternative for the future, because its resource base is widely available, and single farms or small local cooperatives might start biogas plant operation. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Agriculture; Bioenergy; Biogas; Biomass; Energy plants; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Kyoto protocol","Anthozoa",Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50049108456

In recent years, it has become increasingly clear that emissions from sea-going vessels can no longer be ignored. There is a growing need for detailed emission inventories to evaluate the impact of this transport mode on air quality and health. In this paper we present MOPSEA, an activity-based emission model to determine emissions from sea-going vessels. The model considers shipping activities of sea-going vessels on Belgian territory, combined with individual vessel characteristics. We apply this model to study the effects of recent international efforts to reduce emissions from sea-going vessels in Belgian territorial waters for the current fleet and for two scenarios up to 2010. The emission model for Belgium, based on different vessel operating areas, reveals that most maritime emissions from the main engines will increase. CO2 emissions will increase by 2-9% over the 2004-2010 period due to an increase in shipping activity. NOX emissions are projected to rise between 1% and 8% because the increase in activity offsets the reductions from the international maritime organisation (IMO) and European regulations. In contrast, SO2 emissions will decrease by at least 50% in 6 years time. The switch of auxiliaries from heavy fuel oil to diesel oil at berth results in a large emission reduction (33%) for PM and small reductions for CO2, NOX, CO and HC (4-5%). The choice between a bottom-up versus top-down approach can have important implications for the allocation of maritime emissions. The MOPSEA bottom-up model allocates only 0.7 Mton CO2 to Belgium, compared to 24.2 Mton CO2 based on bunker fuel inventories. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

CN(A-X), CN(B-X) and CH(A-X) emissions were observed. Their relative intensities were studied by fluorescence excitation (FEX) spectroscopy. The fluorescence quantum yield for CN(B-X) emission is of the order of 1.5%, whereas that of CN(A-X) is of the order of 0.5%, relatively independent of excitation wavelength in the 9-20 eV region. The CN FEX spectra follow quite closely the photoabsorption spectrum. The total photoionization quantum yield of CH3CN was measured up to 22 eV. The structures in the yield curve were related to photoabsorption features. The total photoionization quantum yield is about 0.5 at 13.131 eV, the energy of the first excited state of the ion; it reaches unity at about 21.3 eV. Dissociative reaction channels forming neutral products are discussed in detail.

US Government-sponsored building energy efficiency research and implementation programs are focused on reducing energy consumption in US residential and commercial buildings and reducing these carbon (C) emissions. Although not specifically intended for adaptation to a warmer climate and less effective than under today's cooler climate, these programs also could help reduce energy demand in a future warmer world. Warming scenarios projected by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in 2001 imply net overall decreases in both site energy and primary energy consumption in US residential and commercial buildings, largely because of the reduced need for heating. However, there would be as much as a 25% increase in building space cooling demand and a significant part of the increase could be offset by energy-efficiency improvements in buildings. Overall, in the US, buildings-related energy efficiency programs would reduce site energy consumption in buildings in the US by more than 2 EJ in 2020 and primary energy by more than 3.5 EJ, more than enough to offset the projected growth in cooling energy consumption due to climate change and growth in the US building stock. The savings would have an estimated annual net value at 2005 energy prices of between $45.0 and $47.3 billion to consumers. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Buildings; Climate change scenarios; Economic benefits; Energy efficiency; Energy modeling; Mitigation; Residential and commercial","building; carbon emission; climate change; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; fossil fuel; residential energy; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43449127545

The electron emission mechanism depends on the quantum structure effect. The structure effect in improving the field emission (FE) characteristics is mainly due to the change of the band structure and the reduction of the effective surface barrier. Calculations show that FE is greatly enhanced with a QW formed in the multilayered composite structures, accumulating electrons in confine energy levels and lowering the effective surface potential. To interpret experimental results, a dual-barrier model related to the nanostructured layers and a serial two-step mechanism for the electron emission is analysed. Measurements and analyses of the electron emission dependence with field and temperature of cathodes having a composite-layered, i.e., with two ultrathin layers of 4 nm GaN and 2 nm Al0.5Ga0.5N, gave an effective surface tunnelling barrier ∼ 0.5 eV coexisting with an effective thermal activation energy of ∼ 0.85 eV. FE characteristics can then be strongly improved only by the structure modulation of the ultrathin layers for different applications such as Nottingham local cooling or on-off very stable cathodes. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Karstification and geological features, which are included in very thick carbonate rocks (a thickness over 2,000 m and limestone, dolomite, and marble from Paleozoic to Pliocene), and faults-lineaments have been considered as very important agents that will affect the injection of CO2. The micro- and macro-karstification and lineament of the region have been studied, and the rocks of the area have been grouped into two classes based on the appropriateness of karstification as suitable and unsuitable rocks. Karstic and geological features (rocks and dislocation lines) have been compared together in a Geographic Information Systems (GIS); thus, by taking note of the geological-geomorphological characteristics of the area, a case study has been proposed for the CO2 injection from the Gokova power plant emissions with GIS applications, and suitable areas for the injection have been determined for further research.","CO2 storage; GIS and remote sensing; Karstik features; Power plant; Turkey","Electric power plants; CO2 storage; Environmental pollutions; GIS and remote sensing; Karstik features; Pliocene; Power plant; Turkey; Upper Miocene; Power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50249173958

The existence of this lake at that time seems linked to increased monsoonal moisture supply to the Sahel and the Sahara, which in turn was probably ultimately caused by variations in the orbital forcing and higher temperature gradients between ocean and continent. This study provides a synthesis of several works carried out on the Lake Chad Basin and analyses the results of a simulation of the mid-Holocene climate with an Atmosphere General Circulation Model (LMDZ for Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique, IPSL Paris), with emphasis on the possible conditions leading to the existence of Lake Mega-Chad. The aim is to define the best diagnostics to understand which mechanisms lead to the existence of the large lake. This paper is the first step of an ongoing work that intends to understand the environmental conditions that this part of Africa experienced during the Upper Miocene (ca. 7 Ma BP), an epoch that was contemporaneous with the first known hominids. Indeed, early hominids of Lake Chad Basin, Australopithecus bahrelghazali [Brunet, M., et al., 1995. The first australopithecine 2500 kilometers west of the Rift-Valley (Chad). Nature, 378(6554): 273-275] and Sahelanthropus tchadensis [Brunet, M., et al., 2002. A new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, central Africa. Nature, 418(6894): 145-151; Brunet, M., et al., 2005. New material of the earliest hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad. Nature, 434(7034): 752-755] are systematically associated with wet episodes that are documented for 7 Ma BP [Vignaud, P., et al., 2002. Geology and palaeontology of the Upper Miocene Toros-Menalla hominid locality, Chad. Nature, 418(6894): 152-155] and testified by extended lacustrine deposits (diatomites, pelites, various aquatic fauna). Because the mid-Holocene was the last such mega-lake episode, our aim here is to assess the simulated response of Lake Chad to the hydrologic changes caused by 6 kyr BP forcings (orbital variations, albedo, sea surface temperatures) as a test for a future use of the model for studies of the Miocene climate. We show that the induced northward shift of the simulated ITCZ, and the hydrological changes around the lake caused by this shift, are consistent with an increased water balance over the Lake Chad Basin 6000 yr ago. Water supply from the soil (runoff and river inputs) will have to be taken into account in further simulations in order to discuss the timing of the onset, expansion and decay of such a giant water surface in subtropical Africa. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The impetus for the modeling effort came from observations made during the US SO Southern Ocean Global Ocean Ecosystem dynamics (SO GLOBEC) program field surveys in 2001 and 2002 that showed a two-fold decrease in net community production (NCP) and ammonium stocks. Simulated nutrient fields matched these observations, indicating that NCP was mainly controlled by the availability of light to phytoplankton. Greater sea-ice cover led to a shorter phytoplankton bloom in 2001-2002 than in 2000-2001. Furthermore, the simulated lower primary production led to smaller bacterial ammonification during the second year. Additionally, smaller zooplankton stocks were observed that led to less simulated excretion of ammonium during 2002. The results of the numerical simulations showed that remineralization of organic matter to ammonium by bacteria accounted for up to 45% of the ammonium production during each year. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Many nations are embarking on introduction of clean/renewable solar energy for displacement of oil-produced energy. Moreover, solar photovoltaic (PV)-diesel hybrid power generation system technology is an emerging energy option since it promises great deal of challenges and opportunities for developed and developing countries. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (K.S.A) being enriched with higher level of solar radiation, is a prospective candidate for deployment of solar PV systems. Literature indicates that commercial/residential buildings in K.S.A. consume about 10-45% of the total electric energy generated. The aim of this study is to analyze long-term solar radiation data of Dhahran (East-Coast, K.S.A.) to assess the techno-economic feasibility of utilizing hybrid PV-diesel-battery power systems to meet the load of a typical residential building (with annual electrical energy demand of 35,120 kWh). The monthly average daily solar global radiation ranges from 3.61 to 7.96 kwh/m2. National Renewable Energy Laboratory's (NREL) Hybrid Optimization Model for Electric Renewable (HOMER) software has been employed to carry out the present study. The simulation results indicate that for a hybrid system composed of 4 kWp PV system together with 10 kW diesel system and a battery storage of 3 h of autonomy (equivalent to 3 h of average load), the PV penetration is 22%. The cost of generating energy (COE, US$/kWh) from the above hybrid system has been found to be 0.179 $/kWh (assuming diesel fuel price of 0.1$/l). The study exhibits that for a given hybrid configuration, the operational hours of diesel generators decrease with increase in PV capacity. The investigation also examines the effect of PV/battery penetration on COE, operational hours of diesel gensets for a given hybrid system. Concurrently, attention is focussed on un-met load, excess electricity generation, fuel savings and reduction in carbon emissions (for different scenarios such as PV-diesel without storage, PV-diesel with storage, as compared to diesel-only situation), COE of different hybrid systems, cost of PV-diesel-battery systems, etc. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

In karstic cave environments in particular it is not always easy to distinguish, in the field or in the laboratory, between geogenic and anthropogenic cemented features because both are composed of calcite. Here we present a novel study in which bulk oxygen and carbon isotopic analyses were used in order to unequivocally identify anthropogenic calcite derived from hearths in the Neanderthal site of Amud Cave (Israel). We demonstrate that the isotopic composition of wood ash is distinctively different from that of geogenic calcite. The linear relationship observed between carbon and oxygen isotopic compositions of the various sediment types in Amud Cave is interpreted as a mixing line between wood ash and geogenic calcite, thus enhancing our understanding of the origins of sedimentological variability at the site and showing that not all of the cemented sediments in Amud Cave should be regarded as hearths. Our study suggests that the relative abundance of validated hearths in the various areas of the cave may be associated with Neanderthal use of space La Amud Cave. © 2008 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",,"anthropogenic effect; calcite; carbon isotope; isotopic analysis; isotopic composition; Neanderthal; Paleolithic; relative abundance; social behavior; stable isotope; wood ash; Amud Cave; Israel; Northern District",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38549169395

The comparison of some selected physicochemical soil properties viz. texture, particle density, moisture content, pH, organic carbon and total nitrogen between planted site (Telir char) and barren site (Boyar char) has been investigated at surface (0-10 cm) and subsurface (10-45 cm) soil across three different land strips viz. inland, middle part and sea side in Lakshmipur coast of Bangladesh. Sand particles in the soil were lower in planted site than barren site. The reverse trend was found in case of both silt and clay percentage. Coastal afforestation had a significant effect on soil binding process since a common trend of increment in soil particle density was noticed. Maximum increment (20.43% to 23.30%) in soil moisture content was recorded in surface soil across the seaside while at subsurface soil both across the middle part (19.53% to 22.30%) and sea side (20.19% to 22.96%). Moreover, the highest reduction in soil pH was recorded at surface soil (7.27 to 6.60) across the sea side and subsurface soil (7.16 to 6.67) in inland due to the influence of coastal plantation. Across all the land strips and the soil depths studied, soil organic carbon was higher in planted site than in barren site with only exception at subsurface soil in the middle part (0.50% in both sites). Total soil nitrogen in the study area was increased at both depths due to forestation with the highest increment in the inland at both surface and subsurface soil. © 2008 Northeast Forestry University.","Mangroves; Physicochemical properties; Plantation; Soil depth","Animalia; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41149101593

The effects of the triazine-containing terdentate ligand on the photophysics and nonlinear transmission have been explored. The influence of the monodentate ligand, i.e. chloride, pentynyl, and phenylacetylide, and counteranion on the photophysical and nonlinear transmission characteristics of these complexes has also been systematically investigated. It is found that, due to the electron-deficient nature of the triazine ring and the extension of the π system between the terdentate ligand and the 6-(p-tolyl) substituent, the metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT) bands in both the UV-vis spectra ( 1MLCT) and the emission spectra (3MLCT) red-shift in comparison to those of the corresponding platinum(II) complexes with 2,2′:6′,2″-terpyridyl ligands. However, both the emission efficiency from the 3MLCT state and the emission lifetime are significantly reduced. The different monodentate ligands cause a decrease of the energy of the 1MLCT band, going down from the complex with a chloride ligand (1 and 2) to 3 and 4 with a pentynyl ligand to 5 with a phenylacetylide ligand. The chloride-containing complex (2) only shows a terdentate ligand 1ππ* originated emission at 460 nm, while the pentynyl-containing complexes (3 and 4) exhibit an 3MLCT-based emission at ∼615 nm with a lifetime of approximately 180 ns. In contrast, complex 5 with the phenylacetylide ligand emits at both 460 and 622 nm. Among these five complexes, only 3 and 4 exhibit a moderate triplet transient absorption, with a positive band extending from 510 to 820 nm. The lifetimes of the transients are approximately 200 ns, which is tentatively assigned to the 3MLCT excited state. Complexes 3-5 display a weak nonlinear transmission that is affected by the monodentate ligand and the counteranions. In addition, it is revealed that the counteranion has a negligible effect on the 1MLCT state, whereas its effect on the 3MLCT state is drastic, especially on the triplet excited-state absorption coefficient, the quantum yield of the triplet state formation, the quantum yield of the 3MLCT emission, and the nonlinear transmission, as exemplified by complexes 3 and 4. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Electron deficient; Metal-to-ligand charge transfer (MLCT); Monodentate ligands; Nonlinear transmission; P tolyl; Photophysics; Platinum (II); Platinum(II) complexes; Pyridyl; UV vis spectrum; Charge transfer; Complexation; Ion exchange; Ligands; Metals; Platinum; Platinum compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-47249110764

This project will enable small & marginal farmers to earn additional revenues through linkage with the global carbon market by afforesting their degraded lands; the project covers 3500 Hectares in 3 districts of Orissa and 3 districts of Andhra Pradesh. Being a path-breaking project and the stringent requirements of the CDM Board and the Bio-Carbon Fund of the World Bank it has been a herculean task for JKPL to bring this project through. The farmer earns additional revenue for every ton of carbon sequestrated apart from the revenue received by sale of wood, which encourages them to go for plantation bringing about environmental benefits like preventing soil erosion and protection of vital water resources through sustainable land management practices.

We analyze changes in drought occurrence using soil moisture data for the SRES B1, A1B and A2 future climate scenarios relative to the PICNTRL pre-industrial control and 20C3M twentieth century simulations from eight AOGCMs that participated in the IPCC AR4. Comparison with observation forced land surface model estimates indicates that the models do reasonably well at replicating our best estimates of twentieth century, large scale drought occurrence, although the frequency of long-term (more than 12-month duration) droughts are over-estimated. Under the future projections, the models show decreases in soil moisture globally for all scenarios with a corresponding doubling of the spatial extent of severe soil moisture deficits and frequency of short-term (4-6-month duration) droughts from the mid-twentieth century to the end of the twenty-first. Long-term droughts become three times more common. Regionally, the Mediterranean, west African, central Asian and central American regions show large increases most notably for long-term frequencies as do mid-latitude North American regions but with larger variation between scenarios. In general, changes under the higher emission scenarios, A1B and A2 are the greatest, and despite following a reduced emissions pathway relative to the present day, the B1 scenario shows smaller but still substantial increases in drought, globally and for most regions. Increases in drought are driven primarily by reductions in precipitation with increased evaporation from higher temperatures modulating the changes. In some regions, increases in precipitation are offset by increased evaporation. Although the predicted future changes in drought occurrence are essentially monotonic increasing globally and in many regions, they are generally not statistically different from contemporary climate (as estimated from the 1961-1990 period of the 20C3M simulations) or natural variability (as estimated from the PICNTRL simulations) for multiple decades, in contrast to primary climate variables, such as global mean surface air temperature and precipitation. On the other hand, changes in annual and seasonal means of terrestrial hydrologic variables, such as evaporation and soil moisture, are essentially undetectable within the twenty-first century. Changes in the extremes of climate and their hydrological impacts may therefore be more detectable than changes in their means. © Springer-Verlag 2007.",,"climate change; climate effect; climate variation; computer simulation; drought; global warming; hydrological cycle; soil moisture; temperature anomaly",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43749124856

Feedbacks in NCAR's Community Atmospheric Model (CAM) are separated into two components: the change in climate components in response to an imposed forcing and the ""radiative kernel,"" the effect that climate changes have on the top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiative budget. This technique's usefulness depends on the linearity of the feedback processes. For the case of CO2 doubling, the sum of the effects of water vapor, temperature, and surface albedo changes on the TOA clear-sky flux is similar to the clear-sky flux changes directly calculated by CAM. When monthly averages are used rather than values from every time step. the global-average TOA shortwave change is underestimated by a quarter, partially as a result of intramonth correlations of surface albedo with the radiative kernel. The TOA longwave flux changes do not depend on the averaging period. The longwave zonal averages are within 10% of the model-calculated values, while the global average differs by only 2%. Cloud radiative forcing (ΔCRF) is often used as a diagnostic of cloud feedback strength. The net effect of the water vapor, temperature, and surface albedo changes on ΔCRF is -1.6 W m-2 , based on the kernel technique, While the total ΔCRF from CAM is -1.3 W m-2, indicating these components contribute significantly to ΔCRF and make it more negative. Assuming linearity of the ΔCRF contributions, these results indicate that the net cloud feedback in CAM is positive. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospherics; Cobalt compounds; Control theory; Feedback; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; climate modelling; Community atmospheric model (CAM); Feedback processes; Feedbacks]; Forcings; Greenhouse gas concentrations; Radiative budget; Climate change; air temperature; albedo; carbon dioxide; climate feedback; climate forcing; climate modeling; cloud radiative forcing; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45349091207

Computationally, critical loads depend solely on critical limits and the expected rates at which contaminants are lost from the environmental media of concern. Losses include processes such as flushing (water bodies) or leaching (soils), sequestration in sediment, volatilization, and crop removal. A significant challenge is that loss rates will vary with time, especially in response to processes such as climate change. How should regulators deal with these changes with time? This Perspective compares the implications of three options where conditions are: (1) fixed to represent the present, (2) variable with no trend over time, and (3) variable with systematic trends (monotonic and cyclical) over time, and a fourth option using stochastic (probabilistic) evaluation of all plausible future conditions. Soil concentrations over 250 years were computed for each option. As expected, conditions that vary systematically with time can drastically change estimates of environmental concentration, and hence critical loads. However, if it is assumed that regulators periodically revisit critical load estimates taking into account changing conditions, long-term objectives can be achieved. One approach to changing conditions is to stochastically create a family of possible time series of conditions and outcomes. In the example developed here, the range of outcomes from the stochastic treatment encompassed those of the various time-series calculations. The regulatory implications of these findings are discussed.

Comparative experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of a newly established MSW source-classified collection system on the emission of PCDDs/Fs (polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans) and heavy metals (HMs) from a full-scale incinerator in China. As a result of presorting and dewatering, the chlorine level, heavy metal and water content were lower, but heat value was higher in the source-classified MSW (classified MSW) as compared with the conventionally mixed collected MSW (mixed MSW). The generation of PCDDs/Fs in flue gas from the classified MSW incineration was 9.28 ng I-TEQ/Nm3, only 69.4% of that from the mixed MSW incineration, and the final emission of PCDDs/Fs was only 0.12 ng I-TEQ/Nm3, although activated carbon injection was reduced by 20%. The level of PCDDs/Fs in fly ash from the bag filter was 0.27 ng I-TEQ/g.

In order to study the nanomechanical property such as nanohardness, nanoindentation tests have been carried out in the present study. As reference data, Vickers hardness has also been measured. The nanohardness Hn of polished specimen was from 28.3 GPa to 78.3 GPa. The nanohardness of the polished specimen increased with decreasing maximum indentation load, which has been referred to as indentation size effect (ISE). A deformed and detached surface layer was found on top of the specimen after surface polishing. The work hardening surface layer due to polishing the sample strongly affected not only the nanohardness, but also the Vickers hardness, and the nanohardness is more than that of pure WC or WC-10Co cemented carbide. Because the cobalt phase was partly evaporated at the surface due to the heat-treated process, and the Vickers hardness of specimen was from 13.1 GPa to 13.8 GPa, the surface state of heat-treated specimen is not representative of the bulk of the material and cannot be used to test the indentation size effect. Etching the surface layer to remove deformed and detached surface layer is the best way to test indentation size effect, by this method, the nanohardness Hn of specimen was from 13.2 GPa to 15.8 GPa. By removing deformed and detached surface layer of specimen, indentation size was found to be constant. This shows that there is no indentation size effect. © 2007 Elsevier Inc.

PML has also been localized in the cytoplasm, although its function in this localization remains elusive. A general property of primary cancers is their high glycolytic rate which results from increased glucose consumption. However, the mechanism by which cancer cells up-regulate glycolysis is not well understood. Here, we have shown that cytoplasmic PML (cPML) directly interacts with M2-type pyruvate kinase (PKM2), a key regulator of carbon fate. PKM2 determines the proportion of carbons derived from glucose that are used for glycolytic energy production. Over-expression of PML-2KA mutant in the cytoplasm, which was generated by mutagenesis of the nuclear localization signals of PML, in MCF-7 breast cancer cells suppressed PKM2 activity and the accumulation of lactate. PKM2 exists in either an active tetrameric form which has high affinity for its substrate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) or a less active dimeric form which has low affinity for its substrate. Over-expression of PML-2KA suppressed the activity of the tetrameric form of PKM2, but not the dimeric form. Our findings suggest that cPML plays a role in tumor metabolism through its interaction with PKM2. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 by the Molecular Biology Society of Japan/Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,"lactic acid; phosphoenolpyruvate; promyelocytic leukemia protein; pyruvate kinase; pyruvate kinase M2; tumor suppressor protein; unclassified drug; article; binding affinity; cancer inhibition; controlled study; energy yield; enzyme activity; gene overexpression; glycolysis; human; human cell; mutagenesis; priority journal; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; protein metabolism; protein protein interaction; protein structure; structure analysis; Animals; Cell Line, Tumor; Cytoplasm; Energy Metabolism; Gene Expression Regulation, Neoplastic; Hela Cells; Humans; Mice; Mice, SCID; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Mutation; Nuclear Proteins; Pyruvate Kinase; Transcription Factors; Tumor Suppressor Proteins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39749116297

The models used mid-range AlB emission scenarios, independently calculated the resulting composition change, and then performed transient simulations to 2050 examining the response to projected changes in short-lived species and to changes in both long-lived and short-lived species together. By 2050, two models show that the global mean annual average warming due to long-lived GHGs (greenhouse gases) is enhanced by 20-25% due to the radiatively active short-lived species. One model shows virtually no effect from short-lived species. Intermodel differences are largely related to differences in emissions projections for short-lived species, which are substantial even for a particular storyline. For aerosols, these uncertainties are usually dominant, though for sulfate uncertainties in aerosol physics are also substantial. For tropospheric ozone, uncertainties in physical processes are more important than uncertainties in precursor emissions. Differences in future atmospheric burdens and radiative forcing for aerosols are dominated by divergent assumptions about emissions from South and East Asia. In all three models, the spatial distribution of radiative forcing is less important than that of climate sensitivity in predicting climate impact. Both short-lived and long-lived species appear to cause enhanced climate responses in the same regions of high sensitivity rather than short-lived species having an enhanced effect primarily near polluted areas. Since short-lived species can significantly influence climate, regional air quality emission control strategies for short-lived pollutants may substantially impact climate over large (e.g., hemispheric) scales.

A total of two SST trends from the Intergovernmental Panels on Climate Change (IPCC) Special Report on Emissions Scenario (SRES) A1B are used. The two trends are from two coupled climate system models, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) Community Climate System Model Version 3.0 (CCSM3) and the GFDL Climate Model Version 2.0 (CM2), respectively. Results consistently suggest a substantial warming and drying trend over much of China, with a surface air temperature in-crease of 1.0-2.0°C and a 10%-20% decrease in rainfall. Exceptions are the areas from northwestern China to western North China as well as the southern Tibetan Plateau, which are projected to be wetter with a rainfall anomaly percentage increase of 10%-50%. The drying in eastern North China has not been documented to date but appears to be reasonable. Physically, it is attributed to anomalous northeasterly winds at the rear of a low-level cyclone over the South China Sea, the Philippines and the subtropical western North Pacific. These conditions, which govern the climate of eastern China, are forced by the northward shift of convection over warm waters due to additional warming. © 2008, © Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","AGCM; future climate change in China; projection; SST","atmospheric circulation; atmospheric convection; drought; experimental study; regional climate; sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; Pacific Ocean; South China Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70849106576

In order to study bulk solvent effect, single-point energy calculations in aqueous media were carried out for all the species occurring in the reactions at the B3LYP/AUG-cc-pVDZ level of theory, by use of the polarizable continuum model (PCM). Vibrational frequency analysis was performed, and zero-point-energy (ZPE)-corrected total energies and Gibbs free energy changes at 298.15 K were obtained. The genuineness of the calculated transition states was confirmed by visually examining the vibrational modes and also by intrinsic reaction coordinate (IRC) calculations. The reaction between ONOOCO2- and guanine occurring through four different mechanisms leads to the formation of 8-oxoG or its anion, while the reaction between the same two species occurring through a different scheme leads to the formation of 8-nitroG-. It has been shown that the presence of a water molecule along with ONOOCO2- would not affect the reaction mechanisms significantly. Structures of the reactant complexes, product complexes and barrier energies involved in the reactions reveal that CO 2 acts as a catalyst for the reaction between ONOO- and guanine. The cause of the catalytic action of CO2 is mainly due to intermediacy of the CO3 radical anion and NO2 radical into which ONOOCO2- is fragmented while reacting with guanine. The relative stabilities of the different product complexes suggest that the mutation caused by ONOO- in the presence of CO2 would mainly involve 8-oxoG. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Catalytic role; 8 hydroxyguanine; 8 nitroguanine; 8-hydroxyguanine; 8-nitroguanine; carbon dioxide; drug derivative; guanine; peroxynitrous acid; solvent; article; catalysis; chemical model; chemistry; computer simulation; mutagenesis; oxidation reduction reaction; Carbon Dioxide; Catalysis; Computer Simulation; Guanine; Models, Chemical; Mutagenesis; Oxidation-Reduction; Peroxynitrous Acid; Solvents",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45549096266

The distinction is based on different physical and chemical surface properties of the particles observable via the ratio of the signals provided by two portable sensors with different operating principles (photoelectric charging (PC) and diffusion charging).

Negro Jamapa). Southern blot analysis indicated that asparagine synthetase in bean is encoded by a small gene family. Northern analysis of RNAs from various plant organs demonstrated that PvNAS2 is highly expressed in roots, followed by nodules in which it is mainly induced during the early days of nitrogen fixation. Investigations with the PvNAS2 promoter gusA fusion revealed that the expression of PvNAS2 in roots is confined to vascular bundles and meristematic tissues, while in root nodules its expression is solely localized to vascular traces and outer cortical cells encompassing the central nitrogen-fixing zone, but never detected in either infected or non-infected cells located in the central region of the nodule. PvNAS2 is down-regulated when carbon availability is reduced in nodules, and the addition of sugars to the plants, mainly glucose, boosted its induction, leading to the increased asparagine production. In contrast to PvNAS2 expression and the concomitant asparagine synthesis, glucose supplement resulted in the reduction of ureide content in nodules. Studies with glucose analogues as well as hexokinase inhibitors suggested a role for hexokinase in the sugar-sensing mechanism that regulates PvNAS2 expression in roots. In light of the above results, it is proposed that, in bean, low carbon availability in nodules prompts the down-regulation of the asparagine synthetase enzyme and concomitantly asparagine production. Thereby a favourable environment is created for the efficient transfer of the amido group of glutamine for the synthesis of purines, and then ureide generation. © 2008 The Author(s).","Asparagine and ureide synthesis; Asparagine synthetase; Nodules; Phaseolus vulgaris; Sugar signalling","Phaseolus vulgaris; asparagine; aspartate ammonia ligase; glucose; hexokinase; plant RNA; 3' untranslated region; amino acid sequence; article; bean; carbohydrate metabolism; chemistry; enzymology; gene expression regulation; genetics; metabolism; molecular cloning; molecular genetics; nitrogen fixation; nodulation; nucleotide sequence; physiology; plant; plant root; promoter region; RNA processing; sequence alignment; signal transduction; 3' Untranslated Regions; Amino Acid Sequence; Asparagine; Aspartate-Ammonia Ligase; Base Sequence; Carbohydrate Metabolism; Cloning, Molecular; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Glucose; Hexokinase; Molecular Sequence Data; Nitrogen Fixation; Phaseolus; Plant Components; Plant Roots; Promoter Regions (Genetics); RNA Processing, Post-Transcriptional; RNA, Plant; Root Nodules, Plant; Sequence Alignment; Signal Transduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40749161759

Temperature profile of the catalyst bed was measured by IR thermography and product composition was measured with a continuous gas analyzer. The effect of water addition on product composition and catalyst temperature profile was investigated in two different ways: by keeping oven temperature constant and by adjusting oven temperature in order to achieve the same maximum temperature in the catalyst bed. Temperature distribution in the catalyst was measured and, for each operating condition, the fraction of catalyst above a limiting value for deactivation and below a limiting value for coke formation was quantified.

Further declines in rainfall are predicted along with increases in temperature and atmospheric CO2 concentration. This study focused on the implications of such a change for wood production and net ecosystem carbon exchange of pine plantations in that region. The process-based model CenW was evaluated using measurements of basal area and soil moisture in Pinus radiata plantations at seven sites in south-western Australia, encompassing a range of climatic conditions and silvicultural treatments (fertiliser application and thinning). The model predicted basal area very well and soil moisture reasonably well, except for one site where a water table may have provided additional water supply to trees. The model was then applied to assess the effects of the climatic changes that have occurred since 1975 by running the model for whole 30-year rotations, using observed climate data from either the 1945-1975 or 1975-2005 periods. The simulations showed that out of the six sites considered, wood production and net ecosystem carbon exchange were increased in the latter period at three sites, remained almost unchanged at two sites, and decreased at one site. Analysis of the model outputs, aided by additional simulations revealed that the response to the climate shift was determined by soil type (i.e. decreased growth rate was confined to the site with a sandy soil), and by the interaction between rising CO2 levels (positive effect) and changes in rainfall (positive or negative depending on the direction of the change in rainfall). © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Six source categories for PM2.5 emissions were reviewed: on-road mobile sources, nonroad mobile sources, cooking, biomass combustion, fugitive dust, and stationary sources. Ammonia emissions from all of the source categories were also examined. Regional emissions inventories of PM in the exhaust from on-road and nonroad sources were generally consistent with ambient observations, though uncertainties in some emission factors were twice as large as the emission factors. In contrast, emissions inventories of road dust were up to an order of magnitude larger than ambient observations, and estimated brake wear and tire dust emissions were half as large as ambient observations in urban areas. Although comprehensive nationwide emissions inventories of PM 2.5 from cooking sources and biomass burning are not yet available, observational data in urban areas suggest that cooking sources account for approximately 5-20% of total primary emissions (excluding dust), and biomass burning sources are highly dependent on region. Finally, relatively few observational data were available to assess the accuracy of emission estimates for stationary sources. Overall, the uncertainties in primary emissions for PM2.5 are substantial. Similar uncertainties exist for ammonia emissions. Because of these uncertainties, the design of PM2.5 control strategies should be based on inventories that have been refined by a combination of bottom-up and top-down methods.

Population growth is used to calibrate a logistically evolving index of development that influences production efficiency. Energy production efficiency also includes a coefficient that decreases linearly with decreasing carbon intensity of energy production. This carbon intensity is a piecewise linear function of fossil carbon depletion. That function is calibrated against historical data and extrapolated by sampling a set of hypotheses about the impact on the carbon intensity of energy production of depleting fluid fossil fuel resources and increasing cumulative carbon emissions. Atmospheric carbon balance is determined by a first order differential equation with carbon use rates and cumulative carbon use as drivers. Atmospheric CO2 is a driver in a similar heat balance. Periodic corrections are included where required to make residuals between data and model results indistinguishable from independently and identically distributed normal distributions according to statistical tests on finite Fourier power spectrum amplitudes and nearest neighbor correlations. Asymptotic approach to a sustainable non-fossil energy production is followed for a global disaggregation into a tropical/developing and temperate/more-developed region.

However, assuming 5-methyluracil to be non-planar molecule, splitting of all the frequencies could be very well explained. A possible explanation could be the planarity of the pyrimidine ring and non-planarity at carbon site of the methyl group which might cause splitting of the frequencies including three components. The non-equivalence of the three CH bonds of the CH3 group suggests a difference in the strength of the other CH bond on the pyrimidine ring.

CNTs grown/deposited in a thin film are used as cathodes for field emission. In spite of the good performance of such cathodes, the procedure to estimate the device current is not straightforward and the required insight towards design optimization is not well developed. In this paper, we report an analysis aided by a computational model and experiments by which the process of evolution and self-assembly (reorientation) of CNTs is characterized and the device current is estimated. The modeling approach involves two steps: (i) a phenomenological description of the degradation and fragmentation of CNTs and (ii) a mechanics based modeling of electromechanical interaction among CNTs during field emission. A computational scheme is developed by which the states of CNTs are updated in a time incremental manner. Finally, the device current is obtained by using the Fowler-Nordheim equation for field emission and by integrating the current density over computational cells. A detailed analysis of the results reveals the deflected shapes of the CNTs in an ensemble and the extent to which the initial state of geometry and orientation angles affect the device current. Experimental results confirm these effects. © IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Carbon nanotubes; Cathodes; Current density; Degradation; Field emission; Thin films; Electromechanical interactions; Fowler-Nordheim equation; Thin film field emitting diodes; Diodes; carbon; nanotube; article; degradation; diode; field emission; film; fragmentation reaction; mathematical model; molecular mechanics; priority journal; quantitative analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36849035321

Gas is generated in association with these degradation processes and this has the potential to overpressure the repository, which can promote transport of groundwater and gas, and consequently radionuclide transport. Microbial activity plays an important role in organic degradation, corrosion and gas generation through the mediation of reduction-oxidation reactions. A large-scale gas generation experiment has been established at the LLW/ILW repository, Olkiluoto, Finland to examine gas generation from LLW in waste drums disposed of in the operational VLJ Repository (VLJ is a Finnish acronym which translates to ""reactor operating waste""). The experiment has monitored, for a period of 9 a, the rate and composition of gas generated, and the aqueous geochemistry and microbe populations present at various locations within the experiment. There is considerable heterogeneity within the experiment, such that pH is observed to vary from pH 5.5 to pH 10 between organic-rich waste and water associated with concrete. The heterogeneity results in competing anaerobic processes occurring together in the experiment but within different niches. Microbial activity initially dominant in organic waste has after 7 a reduced the alkalinity of the concrete influenced regions. The experiment has been modelled using a biogeochemical reaction-transport code (GRM) using a blind testing approach. Using independent data, the model was able to reproduce, within a factor of two, the rate of gas production. In addition, the model represented the main anaerobic microbial processes leading to methanogenesis and the observed spatial and temporal variations in aqueous and gaseous species. In order to model the experiment, its heterogeneity was considered such that individual waste containers were represented and assumptions were made concerning transport rates of chemical species. Cellulose waste and H2 produced by corrosion provide microbial substrates for reduction processes and CH4 generation. However, gas generation is a complex interaction of waste degradation processes. Simple repository gas generation models that consider corrosion and cellulose degradation in isolation will tend to overestimate H2 content and gas generation. The GRM model is more realistic and utilises information concerning SO42 -, NO3- and other oxidised species present in LLW/ILW to consider the competition between microbial groups for electron donors that reduce the extent of H2 and CH4 generation. Models such as GRM could be applied to other repository systems, such as for high level waste and spent nuclear fuel, to evaluate how H2 gas generation from corrosion and radiolysis may be affected by microbial activity. However, this will require estimation of appropriate microbial kinetic parameters for these more extreme environments. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

Seven samples were collected during one week of operation in 2005. For the fractionation, the scheme applied consisted of extracting the elements in three fractions: (i) soluble and exchangeable elements, (ii) carbonates, oxides and reducible elements and (iii) residual elements. Metals and metalloids at μg g-1 level were determined in each fraction by plasma based techniques namely, inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP OES) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). For validation, a certified reference materials NIST SRM 2711 (Montana soil) was subject to the same chemical sequential extraction procedure. X-ray diffraction powder (XRD) analysis and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to characterize the major minerals present in the matrix. The predominant phases found in the total samples were mullite, quartz, iron oxides and lime. Total analyte concentration varied (in μg g-1) from 1.54 for Cd to 30 600 for Al. The leachability of the 15 elements under study proved to be different. All the elements (except Cd and Pb) were detected in the soluble fraction in the order: Cu (0.10%) ∼ Mn (0.13%) &lt; Ni (0.17%) ∼ Ti (0.19%) ∼ Fe (0.20%) ∼ As (0.21%) &lt; Zn (0.86%) &lt; Al (1.3%) &lt; Cr (2.9%) &lt; V (3.9%) &lt; Sb (6.9%) &lt; Mo (45.1%) &lt; S (58.0%). Percentages higher than 20% of S (24.1%) &lt; V (27.5%) &lt; Mn (29.0%) were detected in the second fraction.

The Franciscan Complex and Great Valley Sequence, which form the bedrock in the California Coast Ranges, are intruded and overlain by Tertiary volcanic rocks including the Clear Lake Volcanic Sequence. These rocks contain two types of mercury deposits, hot-spring deposits that form at shallow depths (&lt; 300 m) and silica-carbonate deposits that extend to depths of 1000 m. Active springs and geothermal areas continue to precipitate Hg and Au and are modern analogues to the fossil hydrothermal systems preserved in the ore deposits. The Franciscan Complex and Great Valley Sequence contain clastic sedimentary rocks with higher concentrations of mercury than volcanic rocks of the Clear Lake Volcanic Field. Mean mercury isotopic compositions (δ202Hg) for all three rock units are similar, although the range of values in Franciscan Complex rocks is greater than in either Great Valley or Clear Lake rocks. Hot spring and silica-carbonate mercury deposits have similar average mercury isotopic compositions that are indistinguishable from averages for the three rock units, although δ202Hg values for the mercury deposits have a greater variance than the country rocks. Precipitates from spring and geothermal waters in the area have similarly large variance and a mean δ202Hg value that is significantly lower than the ore deposits and rocks. These observations indicate that there is little or no isotopic fractionation (&lt; ± 0.5‰) during release of mercury from its source rocks into hydrothermal solutions. Isotopic fractionation does appear to take place during transport and concentration of mercury in deposits, however, especially in their uppermost parts. Boiling of hydrothermal fluids, separation of a mercury-bearing CO2 vapor or reduction and volatilization of Hg(0) in the near-surface environment are likely the most important processes causing the observed Hg isotope fractionation. This should result in the release of mercury with low δ202Hg values into the atmosphere from the top of these hydrothermal systems. Estimates of mass balance suggest that residual Hg reservoirs are not measurably enriched in heavy Hg isotopes as a result of this process because only a small amount of Hg (&lt; 4%) leaves actively ore-forming systems. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Other significant anthropogenic impacts on the global carbon cycle include human utilization of fossil fuels and impacts on less intensively managed systems such as peatlands, wetlands and permafrost. A great deal of knowledge, expertise and data is available within each sector. We describe the contribution of sectoral carbon budgets to our understanding of the global carbon cycle. Whilst many sectors exhibit similarities for carbon budgeting, some key differences arise due to differences in goods and services provided, ecology, management practices used, land-management personnel responsible, policies affecting land management, data types and availability, and the drivers of change. We review the methods and data sources available for assessing sectoral carbon budgets, and describe some of key data limitations and uncertainties for each sector in different regions of the world. We identify the main gaps in our knowledge/data, show that coverage is better for the developed world for most sectors, and suggest how sectoral carbon budgets could be improved in the future.

We outline some of the economic principles of an integrated bilateral green certificates market, and then discuss a number of issues that are deemed to be critical for the effectiveness, stability and legitimacy of such a market. By drawing on some of the lessons of the fairly recent intentions to integrate a future green certificate market in Norway with the existing Swedish one, we highlight, exemplify and discuss some critical policy implementation and design issues. These include, for instance, the system's connection to climate policy targets, the role of other support schemes and the definition of what green electricity technologies should be included. Furthermore, the establishment of an international market presumes that the benefits of renewable power (e.g., its impacts on the environment, diversification of the power mix, self-sufficiency, etc.) are approached and valued from an international perspective rather than from a national one, thus implying lesser emphasis on, for instance, employment and regional development impacts.

Carbon- and oxygen-stable isotope ratios of kaolinite, calcite, and coalbed CO2 were evaluated in combination with measured values and published estimates of δ18O of coalbed paleowaters that had been present at the time of mineralization. δ18Omineral and δ18Owater values jointly constrain the paleotemperature of mineralization. The isotopic evidence and the thermal and tectonic history of this part of the Illinois Basin led to the conclusion that maximum burial and heat-sterilization of coal seams approximately 272 Ma ago was followed by advective heat redistribution and concurrent precipitation of kaolinite in cleats at a burial depth of &lt; 1600 m at ∼ 78 ± 5 °C. Post-Paleozoic uplift, the development of a second generation of cleats, and subsequent precipitation of calcite occurred at shallower burial depth between ∼ 500 to ∼ 1300 m at a lower temperature of 43 ± 6 °C. The available paleowater in coalbeds was likely ocean water and/or tropical meteoric water with a δ18Owater ∼ - 1.25‰ versus VSMOW.

The European summer of 2003 was exceptionally warm, and the surface ozone data for central Europe show the highest values since the end of the 1980s. The 95th percentiles of daily maximum hourly ozone concentrations in 2003 were higher than the corresponding parameter measured in any previous year at many sites in France, Germany, Switzerland and Austria. In this paper we argue that a number of positive feedbacks between the weather conditions and ozone contributed to the elevated surface ozone. First, we calculated an extended residence time of air parcels in the atmospheric boundary layer for several sites in central Europe. Second, we show that it is likely that extensive forest fires on the Iberian Peninsula, resulting from the drought and heat, contributed to the peak ozone values in north Europe in August. Third, regional-scale model calculations indicate that enhanced levels of biogenic isoprene could have contributed up to 20% of the peak ozone concentrations. Measurements indicate elevated concentrations of isoprene compared to previous years. Sensitivity runs with a global chemical transport model showed that a reduction in the surface dry deposition due to drought and the elevated air temperature both could have contributed significantly to the enhanced ozone concentrations. Because of climate change, such heat waves may occur more frequently in the future and may gradually overshadow the effect of reduced emissions from anthropogenic sources of VOC and NOx, in controlling surface ozone.

All Supersites projects developed and evaluated methods and instruments, and significant advances have been made and applied within these programs to yield new insights to our understanding of PM accumulation in air as well as improved source-receptor relationships. The tested methods include a variety of continuous and semicontinuous instruments typically with a time resolution of an hour or less. These methods often overcome many of the limitations associated with measuring atmospheric PM mass concentrations by daily filter-based methods (e.g., potential positive or negative sampling artifacts). Semicontinuous coarse and ultrafine mass measurement methods also were developed and evaluated. Other semicontinuous monitors tested measured the major components of PM such as nitrate, sulfate, ammonium, organic and elemental carbon, trace elements, and water content of the aerosol as well as methods for other physical properties of PM, such as number concentration, size distribution, and particle density. Particle mass spectrometers, although unlikely to be used in national routine monitoring networks in the foreseeable future because of their complex technical requirements and cost, are mentioned here because of the wealth of new information they provide on the size-resolved chemical composition of atmospheric particles on a near continuous basis. Particle mass spectrometers likely represent the greatest advancement in PM measurement technology during the last decade. The improvements in time resolution achieved by the reported semicontinuous methods have proven to be especially useful in characterizing ambient PM, and are becoming essential in allowing scientists to investigate sources of particulate pollution and to probe into the dynamics and mechanisms of aerosol formation in the atmosphere.

The RSC emission concentrations were measured from multiple locations around the Ban-Wall industrial complex (BWIC) in the city of An San (AS), Korea, during a series of field campaigns held between August 2004 and September 2005. These emissions were then used as input for a CALPUFF dispersion model with the 34 dominant chemical reactions for RSCs. The impact of RSC emission on SO2 concentrations was assessed further in the study areas. The model study indicated the possibility that RSCs emitted in and around the BWIC can exert a direct impact on the ambient SO2 concentration levels in its surrounding areas with the most prominent effect observed during summer. Our prediction indicated that a significant fraction of SO2 was produced photochemically in and around the BWIC during the summer (about 30% of total SO2 concentrations) and fall events (∼20%). These photochemical productions of SO2 were mainly ascribable to H2S (∼60% of total contributions) and DMDS (∼25%) out of all five target RSCs.

Clearly the most effective mitigation policy would be to minimise the human contribution to climate change. However, another response now increasingly being considered is the assisted migration of species. While this is not always feasible, and should be subject to careful application of the precautionary principle, some scholars are seeing this as a necessary response to already inevitable climate change. The paper summarises some recent literature on assisted migration, and offers a response from the perspective of Christian ethics. It calls for a kenosis of aspiration, appetite and acquisitiveness. It then looks at general motifs in Pauline ethics to see how they may be reappropriated in engaging with the current environmental crisis. Among the motifs considered are 'other-focus', koinōnia in the community, sufficiency, excess and contentment. The paper then offers a set of criteria (based on a set offered by Neil Messer) for evaluating projects in assisted migration, and concludes that one of their major values will be rhetorical, in showing nations just how much less costly and problematic it would be to engage in policies to mitigate climate change.","Christian ethics; Kenosis; Migration; Pauline ethics",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-70350614000

The horizontal and vertical characteristics of these waves are investigated using winds and temperature data acquired by TIDI (TIMED Doppler Interferometer) and Sounding of Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instruments respectively on TIMED (Thermosphere Ionosphere Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics) satellite and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) winds and temperature. The wave observed in the MIT region has a dominant period of approximately 6.5 days and is found to propagate westward with zonal wave number 1. The horizontal structures of the wave in winds and the temperature indicate that the wave is of gravest symmetric wave number 1 Rossby wave. The downward phase propagation from the MLT region to tropopause indicates that the wave may have a source in the troposphere. The Kelvin wave observed in the UTLS region has zonal wave number 3. However, this wave becomes damped above 23 km, where the above mentioned westward propagating wave begins to amplify. During the observation period, the OLR distribution in the tropics shows similar periodicities, propagating eastward with zonal wave number 3 and westward with zonal wave number 1. These observations suggest that tropical convective heating may be a common source for these waves. © 2008, Meteorological Society of Japan.",,"convective system; Kelvin wave; observational method; periodicity; radar; radiosonde; Rossby wave; stratosphere; tropopause; troposphere; wave propagation; weather forecasting; Asia; Eurasia; Indonesia; Pameungpeuk; Southeast Asia; West Java",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43749093239

It also attempts to compare the protection efficiency of these compounds with polyaniline (PANI)-coated carbon steel. Design/methodology/approach – The green coloured and adherent coatings were obtained by cyclic voltammetry during sequential scanning of the potential region between −0.6 and 1.6 V at a scan rate of 10 mVs−1. Potentiodynamic polarization measurement (DC) was used to obtain an estimate of the corrosion rate and protection efficiency for these electrodeposited polymers on the carbon steel. Scanning electron micrographs (SEM) also were obtained to characterize the deposited coatings. Findings – It was observed that these polymer coatings showed better protection efficiency than the PANI coating. Of the compounds studied, the copolymer PANINMA coating showed higher protection efficiency than other coatings. The SEM observations revealed that the compact continuous dense morphology of PANINMA provided better protection than other coatings.

The singlet state was found to have the lowest energy, its calculated equilibrium geometry and vibration spectrum are in fair agreement with the respective experimental data. Wave function based ab initio calculations at increasing level of accuracy (CASSCF, CAS-CI, MC-CEPA, and SOC-CI) were used to determine the whole manifold of low-lying electronic states. Without inclusion of spin-orbit coupling, several low-lying spin ladders exist, each consisting of a singlet, a triplet, a quintet, and a septet state. The spin coupling is antiferromagnetic in the four lowest ladders, with similar exchange coupling constants J of about -60 cm-1 at the CASSCF and -120 cm-1 at the correlated level. The overall ground state has the symmetry 1Ag. Spin-orbit coupling has a strong effect on the order and energetics of the lowest levels: after its inclusion a nearly degenerate pair of states is found to be lowest in energy, followed by a second pair 300 cm-1 higher in energy and another bunch of six states after another 200 cm-1. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Results suggest that long-term changes in ηib can lead to increases in high-latitude sea level by up to 5 and 10 cm, respectively, after doubling and quadrupling the atmospheric CO2 Content. At low latitudes, sea level will decrease simultaneously between 2 and 4 cm through the combined effects of changes in the atmospheric circulation and through the increase of its moisture content. In subpolar regions, associated rates of sea level increase are of the order of 0.4-0.6 mm yr-1 for quadrupled atmospheric CO, concentrations. while in mid- and low latitudes, sea level will decrease at a rate of 0.2 mm yr-1. Differences between doubling and quadrupling CO2 concentrations indicate regionally dependent nonlinearities in the changing climate system. The analysis suggests that in some regions (including the coasts of northern Europe) low-frequency ηib changes could be as large as 10%-20% of a global sea level increase anticipated over the next 100 yr. While not being a dominant effect, amplitudes of long-period η ib changes are large enough to be included in future estimates of climate-related regional sea level change. Increasing the vertically integrated atmospheric CO2 content by 4 and 12 kg m-2 (on global average), in response to doubling and quadrupling atmospheric CO2 concentrations, suggests associated reductions of global sea level by 0.6 and 1.7 cm, respectively. The differences between two different model solutions are significant, especially in the Southern Ocean, where they show significantly different atmospheric mass and pressure distributions, and at low latitudes, where differences resemble the contribution of increased moisture content added to the inverted-barometer (IB) effect in the MPI-M solution. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric pressure; Atmospherics; Climate change; Climatology; Loading; Meteorology; Oceanography; Pressure; Sea level; Water levels; Global oceans; Low-frequency changes; pressure loadings; Regional response; Frequency response; atmosphere-ocean coupling; atmospheric circulation; atmospheric pressure; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate modeling; global ocean; moisture content; sea level; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45349091923

This system features prototype Lucas electronically controlled injectors, full electronic control, and can vary the percentage of water in the mixture on a cycle-resolved basis. Tests of this system were conducted on a production Volvo D-12 engine, and have produced reduced NOx and smoke emissions over steady-state and transient conditions. Water-diesel coinjection yielded a considerable improvement in NOx-smoke and NOx-BSFC trade-offs under steady-state engine operation. In addition, control of the water percentage on a cycle-resolved basis was shown to be an effective method for mitigating NOx and smoke emissions over step-load transients. Results from this work show that a combination of aggressive EGR and diesel+water coinjection is very promising for producing very low levels of engine-out exhaust emissions, reducing the water storage requirements, and improving fuel efficiency.

Along with air and soil warming, one of the consequences of warming likely to be important for carbon assimilation of tundra plant species is an expected 40% increase in growing season length. We examined the effects of a lengthened growing season and soil warming on the photosynthetic capacity of seven tundra plant species from four growth forms that comprise &gt;90% of the vascular cover of wet tussock tundra. Maximum photosynthetic capacity of these key species was relatively unchanged by the manipulation that significantly altered growing season length, active layer depth, and soil temperatures. Highest photosynthetic rates were found for the forb, Polygonum bistorta, and the lowest for dwarf evergreen shrubs. Seasonal patterns revealed that plants maintained relatively high light-saturated photosynthetic capacity (A max) values throughout most of the growing season. Interannual variation was significant, but differences were small for most species. The study shows that tundra species operate within a relatively narrow range for maximum photosynthetic capacity with this maximum seldom being reached under ambient conditions. Thus, when evaluating the effects of climate change on tundra ecosystem carbon uptake, species composition and total photosynthetic leaf area should be considered first. These two factors will affect the system carbon exchange capacity during climate warming more so than species-level assimilation capacity. © 2008 Regents of the University of Colorado.",,"assimilation efficiency; carbon balance; global warming; grass; growing season; photosynthesis; seasonal variation; shrub; soil temperature; tundra; Alaska; North America; United States; Polygonum; Polygonum bistorta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949187520

Using the mix of generating plants expected to be used for PHEV charging, we find that, while driving on battery power, PHEVs compared to their conventional hybrid counterparts reduce CO2 emissions by 25% in the short term and as much as 50% in the long term. The short-term fractional increase in demand for margin fuels such as natural gas is found to be roughly twice the fractional penetration of PHEVs into the nationwide light-duty vehicle fleet. We also compare, on an energy basis, the CO2 savings of replacing coal plants versus replacing conventional vehicles with PHEVs. The result is found to depend critically on the fuel economy of the vehicles displaced by the PHEVs. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Fuel economy; Natural gas; Energy implications; Plugin hybrid vehicle (PHEV); Capacitance; carbon dioxide; coal; fuel; natural gas; Capacitance; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Fuel economy; Natural gas; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; comparative study; economic analysis; electrical power; emission control; environmental technology; natural gas; traffic emission; article; comparative study; electric battery; electricity; energy; motor vehicle; night; United States; Carbon Dioxide; Conservation of Energy Resources; Environmental Health; United States; Vehicle Emissions; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-39649109891

Researchers are still unclear, however, which climatic/environmental parameter is the primary control on Pleistocene faunal δ15N values. Through extensive nitrogen isotope analysis of Late Pleistocene reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) collagen we investigated whether permafrost development during the Late Pleistocene coincided with changes in δ15N values. After 45 ka BP reindeer δ15N declined, with lowest δ15N values observed after the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), between 15 and 11 ka BP. The decline in δ15N appears to be of a greater magnitude in more northern regions than in the South of France, a pattern similar to that previously observed for horse. On a global scale, ecosystem δ15N is controlled by the relative openness of the nitrogen cycle, which in turn is controlled by climate. Low soil and plant δ15N are observed in cold and/or wet regions and high δ15N are seen in hot and/or arid areas. The regional pattern in reindeer δ15N decline mimics the pattern of climatic deterioration in Europe culminating at the LGM, with climate cooling being more intense in northern Europe than in southern Europe. However, the lowest reindeer δ15N values are observed after temperatures started to rise. This may have been due to a lag in the response of the nitrogen cycle to increasing temperatures. Alternatively it may have been linked to the influence of permafrost degradation on soil and plant δ15N and thus faunal δ15N. The renewed climatic cooling during the Younger Dryas did not see a fall in reindeer δ15N. Limited data does, however, suggest a post Younger Dryas depletion in reindeer δ15N values. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Here we present a new quantification of Late Pliensbachian-Early Toarcian calcareous nannofossils abundance and size from the Peniche reference section (Portugal) together with O and C isotope records of well-preserved brachiopod shells from the same section. The brachiopod shell δ13C curve parallels that of bulk carbonate and records two pronounced negative isotopic excursions, close to the Pliensbachian-Toarcian bound (∼-2‰) and during the Toarcian oceanic anoxic event (∼3.5‰). Our results indicate that both C isotope negative excursions were characteristic of benthic and shallow-water environments, suggesting that these two carbon cycle perturbations affected all epioceanic reservoirs. Coeval shifts toward lower values of brachiopod oxygen isotope compositions and closely correlated northward migrations of Mediterranean ammonite fauna suggest that both events coincided with major rises in seawater temperatures, probably as a result of increased CO2 levels and enhanced greenhouse conditions. CO2-induced changes in seawater chemistry likely affected the calcification potential of both neritic and pelagic systems, as evidenced by synchronous drops of platform-derived carbonate accumulation and drastic reductions in size (&gt;3 μm) of the main pelagic carbonate producer Schizosphaerella. We suggest that the Early Toarcian paleoenvironmental crisis occurred in two distinct episodes that were most likely related to two successive phases of intense volcanic degassing in the Karoo-Ferrar province.

Carbon dioxide is released from soil to the atmosphere as a result of plant root and microbial respiration. Additionally, soils in dry forests are often sinks of methane from the atmosphere. Both carbon dioxide and methane are greenhouse gases whose increasing concentration in the atmosphere contributes to climate warming. Thinning treatments are being implemented in ponderosa pine forests across the southwestern United States to restore historic forest structure and reduce the risk of severe wildfire. This study addresses how thinning alters fluxes of carbon dioxide and methane in ponderosa pine forest soils within one year of management and examines mechanisms of change. Carbon dioxide and methane fluxes, soil temperature, soil water content, forest floor mass, root mass, understory plant biomass, and soil microbial biomass carbon were measured before and after the implementation of a thinning and in an unthinned forest. Carbon dioxide efflux from soil decreased as a result of thinning in two of three summer months. Average summer carbon dioxide efflux declined by an average of 34 mg C m-2 hr-1 in the first year after thinning. Methane oxidation did not change in response to thinning. Thinning had no significant short-term effect on total forest floor mass, total root biomass, or microbial biomass carbon in the mineral soil. Understory plant biomass increased after thinning. Thinning increased carbon available for decomposition by killing tree roots, but our results suggest that thinning reduced carbon dioxide emissions from the soil because the reduction in belowground autotrophic respiration was larger than the stimulation of heterotrophic respiration. Methane oxidation was probably not affected by thinning because thinning did not alter the forest floor mass enough to affect methane diffusion from the atmosphere into the soil. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Many of the major stream systems in the park have acid neutralizing capacity (ANC) less than 20 μeq/L, levels at which chronic and/or episodic adverse impacts on native brook trout are possible. Model hindcasts suggested that none of these streams had ANC less than 50 μeq/L in 1900. Model projections, based on atmospheric emissions controls representative of laws already enacted as of 2003, suggested that the ANC of those streams simulated to have experienced the largest historical decreases in ANC will increase in the future. The levels of S deposition that were simulated to cause streamwater ANC to increase or decrease to three specified critical levels (0, 20, and 50 μeq/L) ranged from less than zero (ANC level not attainable) to several hundred kg/ha/year, depending on the selected site and its inherent acid-sensitivity, selected ANC endpoint criterion, and evaluation year for which the critical load was calculated. Several of the modeled streams situated on siliciclastic geology exhibited critical loads <0 kg/ha/year to achieve ANC >50 μeq/L in the year 2040, probably due at least in part to base cation losses from watershed soil. The median modeled siliciclastic stream had a calculated critical load to achieve ANC >50 μeq/L in 2100 that was about 3 kg/ha/year, or 77% lower than deposition in 1990, representing the time of model calibration. © Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.","Acidification; Critical load; Modeling; Stream chemistry; Sulfur","Acids; Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric composition; Stream flow; Sulfur; Acidification; Critical load; Stream chemistry; Emission control; nitrogen; sulfur; acidification; atmospheric deposition; critical load; modeling; streamwater; sulfur; water chemistry; acid base balance; acidification; air pollution control; article; atmospheric deposition; law; simulation; stream (river); trout; United States; water analysis; water quality; watershed management; North America; Shenandoah National Park; United States; Virginia; Salvelinus fontinalis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349061065

Our position inside the Galaxy requires 3D-modelling to obtain the distribution of the Galactic magnetic field, cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and thermal electrons. Aims. Our intention is to find a Galactic 3D-model which agrees best with available radio observations. Methods. We constrain simulated all-sky maps in total intensity, linear polarization, and rotation measure (RM) by observations. For the simulated maps as a function of frequency we integrate in 15' wide cones the emission along the line of sight calculated, from. Galactic 3D-models. We test a number of large-scale magnetic field configurations and take the properties of the warm interstellar medium into account. Results. From a comparison of simulated and observed maps we are able to constrain the regular large-scale Galactic magnetic field in the disk and the halo of the Galaxy. The local regular field is 2 μG and the average random field is about 3 μG. The known local excess of synchrotron emission originating either from enhanced CR electrons or random magnetic fields is able to explain the observed high-latitude synchrotron emission. The thermal electron model (NE2001) in conjunction with a proper filling factor accounts for the observed optically thin thermal emission and low frequency absorption by optically thick emission. A coupling factor between thermal electrons and the random, magnetic field component is proposed, which in addition to the small filling factor of thermal electrons increases small-scale RM fluctuations and thus accounts for the observed depolarization at 1.4 GHz. Conclusions. We conclude that an axisymmetric magnetic disk field configuration with reversals inside the solar circle fits available observations best. Out of the plane a strong toroidal magnetic field with different signs above and below the plane is needed to account for the observed high-latitude RMs. The large field strength is a consequence of the small thermal electron scale height of 1 kpc, which also limits the CR electron extent up to a height of 1 kpc not to contradict with the observed synchrotron emission out of the plane. Our preferred 3D-model fits the observed Galactic total intensity and polarized emission better than other models over a wide frequency range and also agrees with the observed RM from, extragalactic sources. © ESO 2007.","Galaxy: structure; ISM: magnetic fields ISM: structure; Polarization; Radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; Radiation mechanisms: thermal","Cosmic rays; Galaxies; Light polarization; Magnetic fields; Natural frequencies; Galaxy: structure; ISM: magnetic fields ISM: structure; Radiation mechanisms: non-thermal; Radiation mechanisms: thermal; Radio astronomy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38349129623

For the treatment of these types of dysarthria, a Nasal Speaking Valve (NSV), which regulates nasal emission utilizing one-way valve, has been reported to be effective. As the unpleasantness while wearing the NSV was less than that with the conventional Palatal Lift Prosthesis, the NSV could be worn for a longer period of time. As NSV is inserted into the nostrils, this device could easily be provided for edentulous patients. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of NSV on experimentally induced VPI condition. Intelligibility of monosyllabic speech, intelligibility of conversational speech, nasalance score and acoustic analysis were used to evaluate the effect of NSV. Local infiltration anaesthesia was achieved to the area of levator veli palatini muscle and tensor veli palatine muscle of seven adult male subjects. In all subjects, remarkable suppression of the soft palate movement could be observed after the local infiltration anesthesia. Although the utterance supported by NSV under the experimentally induced VPI condition was less natural than the normal utterance, the intelligibility was markedly improved by the device. From the results of this study, the acoustic properties of NSV on the pure VPI condition, which was enabled by the newly established experimental induction, were revealed. This experimental model was also proved to provide a basis for the improvement in the treatment modalities for VPI. © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Dysarthria; Hypernasality; Intelligibility; Palatal lift prosthesis; Speech; Velopharyngeal incompetence","adult; article; evaluation; human; local anesthesia; male; movement (physiology); nose cavity; palatopharyngeal incompetence; pathophysiology; prostheses and orthoses; prosthesis; soft palate; speech; speech disorder; speech intelligibility; treatment outcome; Adult; Anesthesia, Local; Humans; Male; Movement; Nasal Cavity; Palate, Soft; Prostheses and Implants; Prosthesis Design; Speech Acoustics; Speech Disorders; Speech Intelligibility; Treatment Outcome; Velopharyngeal Insufficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149111828

The hydrogen charging of steels has been found to reach a level causing their plasticity loss. No effect, a plasticity loss and a significant decrease in the number of cycles have been stated in constant load, slow strain rate and fatigue tests, respectively. The results showed the local active plastic deformation proceeded close to the surface of hydrogen ingress to provide the highest possibility for hydrogen induced metal degradation in hydrocarbon environments. Although the source of hydrogen evolved in the case of technical hydrocarbons has been discussed, the promoting effect of formed H2S should be recognized as the important factor influencing the hydrogen charging from those environments. Some variation in the steel microstructure, chemical composition and hardness of steels, even allowed by the standard may affect their susceptibility to hydrogen degradation in hydrocarbons. © 2008 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

It is unlikely that these powerful economic forces will change sufficiently in response to consumer desires to eat less and move more or corporate desires to be more socially responsible. When the free market creates substantial population detriments and health inequalities, government policies are needed to change the ground rules in favour of population benefits. Concerted action is needed from governments in four broad areas: provide leadership to set the agenda and show the way; advocate for a multi-sector response and establish the mechanisms for all sectors to engage and enhance action; develop and implement policies (including laws and regulations) to create healthier food and activity environments, and; secure increased and continued funding to reduce obesogenic environments and promote healthy eating and physical activity. Policies, laws and regulations are often needed to drive the environmental and social changes that, eventually, will have a sustainable impact on reducing obesity. An 'obesity impact assessment' on legislation such as public liability, urban planning, transport, food safety, agriculture, and trade may identify 'rules' which contribute to obesogenic environments. In other areas, such as marketing to children, school food, and taxes/levies, there may be opportunities for regulations to actively support obesity prevention. Legislation in other areas such as to reduce climate change may also contribute to obesity prevention ('stealth interventions'). A political willingness to use policy instruments to drive change will probably be an early hallmark of successful obesity prevention. © 2008 Swinburn; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"article; attitude to health; consumer advocacy; environmental change; food safety; funding; government regulation; health care planning; health care policy; human; law; law enforcement; leadership; obesity; physical activity; priority journal; public health service; social change; social marketing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46649102087

The largest new technology groups are carbon-capture and storage (CCS), nuclear power, wind power, advanced bioenergy technologies and energy efficiency measures. CCS technologies contributed a 5.5-Pg CO2 annual emission reduction by 2050 and 12 Pg CO2 reduction by 2100. Also large-scale forestation measures were found cost-efficient.

Box 160-C, Concepción, Chile","To simulate the quantitative effects of regional biomass alternatives for energetic purpose (BfE) on air pollutant emissions, a system dynamics model was developed and applied for the EuRegion Austrian-Hungarian cross-border area. The dynamic simulation program Vensim® was used to build an overall regional model with economic, social and environmental sectors. Within this model, the here-introduced regional air pollution sub-model (RegAir) includes the important human-made emissions of 10 pollutants resulting from all relevant source sectors within the region investigated. Emissions from activities related to biomass production, transport, conversion and final energy consumption were built in detail. After building and calibrating the RegAir model, seven quantitative test scenarios were defined and implemented into the model. Through the scenarios simulation, effects on air emissions were followed and compared over time. The results of these simulations show a significant reduction of CO2 emissions, especially in cases where fossil fuel displacement in heating devices is achieved on the largest scale. On the contrary, traditional air pollutants increase by most BfE options. The results of the RegAir model simulations of BfE alternatives over two decades provide useful quantifications of various air emissions and identify the less pollutant BfE alternatives in the dynamic context of the relevant air pollution sources of the region. After minor structural modifications and appropriate calibration, RegAir can be applied to other regions as well. However, it is stated that, to finally decide on the overall most-appropriate options at a regional level, other environmental as well as economic and social effects must be taken into consideration, being the latter the goal of the mentioned overall regional model which serves as a model frame to the RegAir tool. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Since the patterned indium tin oxide (ITO) electrodes for the future devices are used as heat source so that the dye doping area mimics the shape of the ITO pattern heated, this method can remove the precise positioning between the ITO electrode and dye doping area which is usually required in other techniques. This paper reports some results on the polymer light-emitting devices made through the maskless dye diffusion technique. When poly(9,9-dioctylfluorene) (PDOF) was used as host material, diffusion of Coumarin 6 and a phosphorescent dye BtpIr yields green and red emission, respectively. In the case of BtpIr-diffused device, the quantum efficiency of the device was found to be about 2.5 times of the device with non-treated PDOF film.

Impacts of global climate change alone on regional nitrogen and sulfur deposition are small compared to impacts from emission control-related reductions for the projections used in this study. The combined effect of climate change and emission reductions is a decrease in the annual average nitrogen and sulffir deposition over the US.

As a possible carbon resource, we had proposed a process for the reduction of CO2 by hydrothermal method. In the process, CO2, aqueous solvent, and reductant are to react under hydrothermal condition, to generate organic compounds. In this report, the extension of the process to continuous-type process has been focused. For the experiments, newly developed continuous-type equipment was used. Metallic materials such as carbon steel cutting chaff was treated at 200 °C, 2.0 MPa under the constant flow of CO2 gas and solvent, with or without the hydrogenation catalyst, Ni. During the experimental period, reaction gas and liquid are collected successively. The samples are analyzed with GC and TOC. In treatment without Ni powder, organic compound was detected in neither reaction gas nor solution, while the occurrence of CO was confirmed. On the other hand, in the experiment with Ni powder additionally, formic acid was generated. It has been confirmed that the reaction process proceeds even in the continuous-type treatment including the catalytic effect of Ni. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.",,"Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Formic acid; Fossil fuels; Hydrothermal synthesis; Aqueous solvents; Carbon resource; Catalytic effect; Organic compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40849120003

Samples were collected as fine (&lt;2.1 μm) and coarse particle (2.1-7.0 μm) from April 2003 to March 2004 using low-volume Andersen sampler. The carbonaceous components were analyzed by a thermal method and a thermal/optical method. Elemental carbon (EC) determined by thermal method was higher than those by thermal/optical method, and slope of linear regression of the thermal method versus the thermal/optical method differed at both sampling points. These results suggested possible analytical artifacts, a difference in the composition of the carbonaceous components of the aerosols, or both. The EC concentrations in fine particles in the roadside were higher than in the general environment by 5 μg m-3, and it was accounted for 68% of the difference of the mass concentration. The mass concentration reconstructed by the mass closure model using element analysis results corresponded more closely to the observed mass concentration in the general environment samples than in the roadside samples. It is suggested that the contribution of the organic compounds in the roadside particles was underestimated. Diesel vehicle emission control regulations implemented in October 2003 seem to have had an effect because there was a significant difference in the average concentration of suspended particulate matter and NOx before and after implementation of the regulations.

The monthly anomalies in January with a high degree of zonal symmetry are found to extend from the surface into the lower stratosphere, in a manner similar to the Arctic Oscillation (AO). The formation of the AO-like signature in January tends to follow the strengthening/weakening of upward propagation of planetary waves in November over the western portion of Eurasia, where temperature anomalies associated with a train of external Rossby waves modify the thermal structure of the climatological planetary waves. In the lower stratosphere the external Rossby wavepacket also modulates meridional winds associated with the climatological planetary waves, augmenting upward propagations of the planetary waves. Thus, modulated upward propagation of the planetary waves subsequently changes the intensity of the stratospheric polar vortex, leading to the formation of the stratospheric AO-like signals and their downward extension. 1his study presents an example in which regional modifications in the structures of the upward-propagating planetary waves due to a zonally-confined external Rossby wave train can change the intensity of the stratospheric polar vortex, which may possibly prolong the predictability of seasonal climate anomalies in the Arctic and surrounding regions. © 2008, Meteorological Society of Japan.",,"Arctic Oscillation; climate prediction; planetary wave; polar vortex; Rossby wave; stratosphere; surface pressure; temperature anomaly; thermal structure; wave propagation; Arctic; Eurasia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-49849099424

Our knowledge on this topic from the arid and semiarid regions such as the West African Sahel (WAS) is, however, very limited. To address this problem, a study was undertaken in the Ségou region of Mali (annual temperature: 29 °C; annual rainfall: 300-700 mm in 60-90 days; soils: Haplustalfs (USDA Soil Taxonomy)/Lixisol (FAO classification), loamy sand, low in fertility) on five land-use systems in farmers' fields (two traditional parkland systems with Faidherbia albida and Vitellaria paradoxa as the dominant tree species, two improved agroforestry systems (live fence and fodder bank), and a so-called abandoned land, i.e., land that was previously under cultivation but was abandoned after it became unproductive). Carbon stock in the biomass was estimated by allometric equations and soil C stock was determined at three depths (0-10 cm, 10-40 cm and 40-100 cm). Biomass C stock ranged from 0.7 to 54.0 Mg C/ha, and total C stock (biomass C + soil C, 0-100 cm depth) from 28.7 to 87.3 Mg C/ha, indicating that a major portion of the total amount of C in the system is stored in the soil. Traditional parkland agroforestry systems had relatively larger C stock than the improved systems, but they seemed to have only limited potential for sequestering additional C. On the other hand, the improved systems showed higher potential for sequestering C from the atomsphere. The results show that soil C is a substantial component of the total C stock of the system, suggesting the importance of considering soil C in C sequestration calculations, which at present is not recognized by Kyoto Protocol. Carbon sequestration benefit is a promising incentive for introducing agroforestry practices and contributing to sustainable land-use in the WAS. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Based on a consideration of the plasma ionization effect and local conservations of mass, momentum and energy, combined with the assumption that plasma can be viewed as a compressible ideal fluid and a high temperature-high pressure ideal gas, we developed a new dynamics expansion mechanism for plasma produced by pulsed laser radiation. A set of new plasma expansion dynamics equations based on our model are first deduced. Then, taking the example of the carbon target, using the finite difference method, the plasma flow dynamics into a vacuum, such as plasma spacial number density distribution, plasma number density and velocity evolvement in radial and axial directions, are studied in detail. The results show that there are some main factors affecting the velocity distribution of the plasma, including the temperature of the plasma, the ionization fraction of the plasma and the dynamic source provided by the vaporized material. The velocity uz in the longitudinal direction is different from ur in the transverse direction because of huge initial eject velocity and evaporated dynamic source.

The first simulation was set for the heating stage prior to carburizing, using a microscopic model of a spherical carbide and surrounding austenite matrix. This revealed the undissolved status of the carbide even at carburizing temperatures, which was stored as the starting condition of the second simulation. Separately, in a planar model, the macroscopic carbon diffusion during the isothermal carburizing stage was calculated, and time functions of carbon activity were evaluated at the depth of interest. The change in activities was assumed to represent the boundary conditions of the local carbide/austenite region, and thus input to the restored spherical model to do the second simulation of carburizing stage. The simulation method linking these double-scale diffusion calculations has first been implemented using the DICTRA package, and applied to the carbide in multicomponent model steels. The carbide radius as well as volume fraction were successfully predicted for all stages in the carbide-dispersed carburizing (CDC) process. However, minor corrections were necessary because of the decrease in the number density of carbide particles and the discontinuity in carbon activity caused by the use of two different models. © The Minerals, Metals & Materials Society and ASM International 2008.",,"Austenite; Carbon; Carburizing; Computer simulation; Mathematical models; Thermal diffusion; Carbide dispersed carburizing; Carbon activity; Isothermal carburizing; Spheroidized carbide; Carbides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43649108104

Today, not only steady state emissions but also emissions during transients are regulated and have to be studied in order to be reduced. In this paper, we describe a new methodology developed to measure the instantaneous level of gaseous emissions from a internal combustion engine during transients, using an analyzer initially designed for steady state operation. Moreover a new phenomenological thermodynamical combustion model is proposed in order to compute emissions during transients. The results of these two methods are compared on various transients. The measurement method seems to give good results (except for hydrocarbon (HC) measurements), as long as the speed and load variations are not too fast. Otherwise, the frequency of the analyzer which was used becomes the limiting factor The new combustion heat release developed to simulate transients, coupled with an existing two-zone model for emission calculations, leads to satisfactory results for CO""2 and O""2 concentrations and NO""x emissions. The agreement with measurements is good for smooth transients and seems promising for faster dynamics. The initial goal was reached, although some improvements are still necessary concerning HC measurements and the fastest transients. These results could be helpful when trying to reduce the amount of pollutant emissions at the exhaust during transients, directly or with after treatment devices.

One such spill was that of the Russian tanker the Nakhodka that spilled heavy oil into the Sea of Japan on January 2, 1997. This paper describes the three main processes of the Nakhodka oil spill, including: (1) the weathering of hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria (genus Pseudomonas) and crystallized organic compounds from the Nakhodka oil spill-polluted seashores after nine years; (2) the laboratory-scale biodegradation of the Nakhodka oil spill over a 429-day period; and (3) the bioavailability of kaolinite clay minerals and the role they play in seawater polluted with the Nakhodka oil spill. Upon the slow evaporation of the Nakhodka oil spill during the 9-year weathering, the dendritic crystal growth of paraffin (a mixture of alkanes) occurred in the oil crust under natural conditions. Heavy metals were obtained in the original heavy oil samples of three seashores in the Sea of Japan. Si, S, Ti, Cr, Ni, Cu, and Zn were found in the original Nakhodka oil spill samples whereas these heavy metals and S were no longer present after 9 years. The anaerobic reverse side of the oil crust contained numerous coccus-type bacteria associated with halite. The hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria and paraffin wax in the oil crust may have a significant effect on the weathering processes of the Nakhodka oil spill during the 9-year bioremediation. A biodegradation process of heavy oil from the Nakhodka oil spill by indigenous microbial consortia was monitored over 429 days in the laboratory. The indigenous microbial consortia consisted of bacteria and fungi as well as the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolated from Atake seashore, Ishikawa Prefecture, Japan. Both bacteria and fungi had a significant role in the observed biodegradation of heavy oil during the 429-day bioremediation with respect to the pH of the solution. Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria had a tendency to play the greatest role under neutral to alkaline condition (pH; 7-7.8). On the contrary, when pH shifted to acidic (pH; 2-4) levels, the fungi took over to degrade heavy oil. During the period, the aliphatic hydrocarbons were reduced significantly but the aromatic hydrocarbons remained relatively constant even after 429 days of bioremediation. Experimental study was undertaken to investigate the bioavailability of kaolinite clay minerals and the role they play in seawater polluted with the Nakhodka oil spill. TEM/EDS imaging suggested that the clays present in oil-polluted seawater were capable of stimulating oil-degrading bacteria probably because Si from clays facilitates bacterial usage of oil and C-O-Na-Si complexes on the surfaces of bacterial cell walls are a stimulator for oil-degrading bacterial growth in seawater contaminated with the Nakhodka oil spill. © 2008 Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH.","Aliphatic hydrocarbons; Aromatic hydrocarbons; Bioremediation; Clay minerals; Heavy oil; Hydrocarbon-degrading bacteria; Kaolinite; Nakhodka oil spill; Paraffin wax; Pseudomonas",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44949209433

This can be achieved within the context of current physical parameterization schemes in weather and climate prediction models. Parameterizations are typically used to predict the evolution of grid-mean quantities because of unresolved subgrid-scale processes. However, parameterizations can also provide estimates of higher moments that could be used to constrain the random determination of the future state of a certain variable. The general equations used to estimate the variance of a generic variable are briefly discussed, and a simplified algorithm for a stochastic moist convection parameterization is proposed as a preliminary attempt. Results from the implementation of this stochastic convection scheme in the Navy Operational Global Atmospheric Prediction System (NOGAPS) ensemble are presented. It is shown that this method is able to generate substantial tropical perturbations that grow and ""migrate"" to the midlatitudes as forecast time progresses while moving from the small scales where the perturbations are forced to the larger synoptic scales. This stochastic convection method is able to produce substantial ensemble spread in the Tropics when compared with results from ensembles created from initial-condition perturbations. Although smaller, there is still a sizeable impact of the stochastic convection method in terms of ensemble spread in the extratropics. Preliminary simulations with initial-condition and stochastic convection perturbations together in the same ensemble system show a promising increase in ensemble spread and a decrease in the number of outliers in the Tropics. © 2008 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climatology; Computer simulation; Moisture; Stochastic models; Ensemble prediction; Stochastic convection method; Weather forecasting; atmospheric convection; climate prediction; ensemble forecasting; estimation method; extratropical environment; parameterization; perturbation; stochasticity; weather forecasting",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849167583

The latter processes release large amounts of energy that are captured in the form of chemical energy and used then as the power that supports the maintenance of life. The electrons used for the reductive processes in photosynthetic plants are released during the oxidation of the H2O to O2, whereas in the catabolic processes the opposite direction is followed by reduction of molecular oxygen (O2) to water (H2O) (Scheme 16.1). The latter reaction is catalyzed by the last enzyme of the respiratory chain, namely cytochrome oxidase (complex IV), which binds molecular oxygen in its active site and reduces it to H2O by donating four electrons without any release of partially reduced intermediates. However, a small part of the oxygen consumed by mitochondria (usually about 2-4%) is reduced, even under normal conditions, by single electrons leading to the formation of a variety of reactive oxygen intermediates (Scheme 16.2). In this way, aerobic organisms are continuously exposed to endogenously generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) and in spite of the existed anti-oxidant defenses, a steady-state concentration of ROS is always present.1 In addition, a number of pathological conditions have been shown to be intimately connected to increased steady-state levels of ROS which may be the result of either an increased rate of production or a decreased ability for the removal of these species.2-5 This temporary imbalance of cellular redox equilibrium is usually defined as “oxidative stress.”6 This imbalance of the cellular redox equilibrium is not, as believed before, an unavoidable side effect of oxygen metabolism but rather it appears to be a carefully regulated process, capable of transferring important signals from cell surface toward the genetic machinery of the cell.7 Today, redox regulation of gene expression is regarded as a vital mechanism involved in a number of pathophysiological complications in humans and animals.8,9 Oxygen, due to its ubiquitous appearance in biological materials and its ability to accept single electrons from other compounds represents the main source of reactive species in cells. One electron reduction of oxygen leads to the formation of superoxide radicals (O2.-) whereas, when it is reduced by two electrons, the product is hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). It has to be noted that the latter compound is not a free radical, but it can participate in processes that contribute to formation of free radicals. Ferrous iron, cuprous copper, and several other transition metals are able to donate a third electron to H2O2, causing the breakage of the O-O bond. In these cases the one part of the molecule is reduced to the state of water while the other part forms the extremely reactive hydroxyl radical (.OH). The latter is one of the most potent oxidants known, reacting indiscriminately with any organic molecule that is going to be in the vicinity of its generation. © 2008 by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-76749151746

In situ x-ray photoelectron spectroscopic measurements under reaction conditions indicated that much less carbon was dissolved in palladium during unselective, total hydrogenation. Additional studies of hydrogen content using in situ prompt gamma activation analysis, which allowed us to follow the hydrogen content of palladium during catalysis, indicated that unselective hydrogenation proceeds on hydrogen-saturated β-hydride, whereas selective hydrogenation was only possible after decoupling bulk properties from the surface events.

This becomes an issue worldwide. In big cities, lightweight vehicles have a great potential and advantages with regard to these issues. To reduce emissions in some big cities, governmental regulation requests the local cars being operated on CNG (Compressed Natural Gas). This gives bi-fuel (petrol and CNG) or CNG-mono-fuel vehicles a chance [1, 2]. MAGNA STEYR designed a bi-fuel 3-wheeler concept car and carried out simulations to find a good compromise between small engine and good performance. Styling studies, lightweight base-frame studies and an engine concept was developed for a 3-wheeler, but a module system should allow a taxi or cargo variant for either a 3-wheeler or a 4-wheeler. A main part of this paper, which was drawn up in association with the Institute of Internal Combustion Engines and Thermodynamics at the Graz University of Technology, deals with the results of a synthetic engine concept for a small single cylinder engine.

The rural poor in dry areas will suffer the most from these changes and will require a range of coping strategies to help them adapt to changing climates. Strategies will include changing of cropping systems and patterns, switching from cereal-based systems to cereal-legumes and diversifying production systems into higher value and greater water use efficient options. The latter include judicious use of water using supplementary irrigation systems, more efficient irrigation practices and the adaptation and adoption of existing and new water harvesting technologies. Scope for the application of conservation agriculture in dry areas is thought to be limited by low biomass production but current evidence suggests that even small amounts of residue retention can significantly decrease soil erosion losses. These options will be supplemented by the development of more drought and heat tolerant germplasm using traditional and participatory plant breeding methodologies and better predictions of extreme climatic events. The majority of drylands are occupied by rangelands with some 828 Mha in West Asia and North Africa alone. These vast areas provide environmental services such as the regulation of water quantity and quality, biodiversity and carbon sequestration. Rangelands have been neglected in the past partly because of problems of ownership, access and governmental policies that discourage investments in rangelands. The idea of payment for environmental services in rangelands is in its infancy but is discussed here as a potential option for better use and management of rangelands and as a safety net to reduce the vulnerability of rangeland inhabitants to climate change. In addition to the promising technological options to reduce vulnerability to climate change a brief discussion is included on the institutional and policy options needed to create a better enabling environment for increased adaptation and ecosystem resilience. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In the selected fertile bulk composition, 30 wt.% potassic granite (2.5 GPa) or phonolite (5.0 GPa) melt is generated at the fluid-absent solidus. The temperature of the latter increases from 900 °C at 2.4 GPa to 1070 °C at 5.0 GPa. Phengite + quartz/coesite control initial silicate melting and melt productivity through the reaction phengite + quartz/coesite +clinopyroxene + calcite = silicate melt + kyanite + garnet, which leaves most of the Fe-Mg-calcite in the residue. Na remains compatible in clinopyroxene (DNacpx/melt = 3.1 to 7.3 at the fluid-absent solidus), resulting in silicate melts with K2O/Na2O wt-ratios of 5.8-8.6.

The experiments provide a possible source for Ca-carbonatites in combination with alkaline granitic to phonolitic melts at temperatures unlikely to be achieved during ongoing subduction. Large scale carbonate transfer to the subarc mantle can thus only be achieved when burying rates slow considerably down or subducted crust becomes incorporated into the mantle. Consequently, it is likely that carbonates will not be extensively mobilized in a typical subarc region, thus extending and confirming earlier results from subsolidus studies (Connolly, J.A.D., 2005.

This paper attempts to show the potential importance of visual culture within a field that we may call cultural climatology. Cultural climatology seeks to explore the dialectic between society and atmosphere, weather and climate at a variety of temporal and spatial scales. A new visual approach to cultural climatology is presented as a possible way of stimulating conversations across the divide between the social and physical sciences. Images and visualisation assert their presence in the understanding, modelling and communication of many nature/culture debates, highlighting a need both for visual literacy across geography, and for social and physical scientists to share their visual methodologies. Cultural climatologists, like other scientists, need visual methodologies for both the critical construction and deconstruction of the images they wish to present and with which they are confronted. To illustrate the importance of visual literacy for cultural climatologists this paper introduces a sample of works from three artists: Constable, Monet and Eliasson. It shows how an exploration of their work (via a theory of pictures) could help to provide: firstly a methodology for understanding the cultural symbolism of skies and weather; secondly an assessment of the urban atmosphere in London at the turn of the 20th century and thirdly an example of the effective representation of atmosphere, weather and climate involving public participation and understanding. Lessons learned from deconstructing these works of art will then be used to suggest improvements in the visualisation of weather in the production and consumption of weather forecasts (thus, picturing theory). © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Such emissions and corresponding air quality impacts can be modulated by different forest management practices. The impacts of changing burning seasons and frequencies and of controlling emissions during smoldering on regional air quality in Georgia are quantified using source-oriented air quality modeling, with modified emissions from prescribed fires reflecting effects of each practice. Equivalent fires in the spring and winter are found to have a greater impact on PM25 than those in summer, though ozone impacts are larger from spring and summerfires. If prescribed fires are less frequent, more biofuel is burnt in each fire, leading to larger emissions and air quality impacts per fire. For example, emissions from a fire with a 5-year fire return interval (FRI) are 72% larger than those from a fire of the same acreage with a 2-year FRI. However, corresponding long-term regional impacts are reduced with the longer FRI since the annual burned area is reduced. Total emissions for fires in Georgia with a 5-year FRI are 32% less than those with a 2-year FRI.

Grassland management techniques such as fertilization and haying can influence both SOC and soil N transformations. In mesic grasslands, where SOC can be high compared with drier regions, it is unclear to what extent heterotrophic denitrifiers will respond to such management practices. Biomass removal via haying can reduce SOC, whereas fertilization decreases C:N ratios of plant residues, which can decrease or increase heterotrophic microbial activity, respectively. We experimentally manipulated haying and fertilization regimens on a grassland in northeastern Kansas and measured resulting inorganic N availability, field fluxes of N2O and potential denitrification, and litter C:N ratios to assess how these management practices may influence soil N2O evolution. We observed N2O fluxes that were an order of magnitude larger than those reported in drier grassland systems with lower SOC. The largest N2O fluxes observed were in fertilized and fertilized/hayed plots, immediately after precipitation events. Haying periodically mitigated N2O fluxes. Denitrification enzyme activity was lower in hayed plots than unhayed plots, and greater with glucose-C additions, indicating that the C substrate in these soils is an important driver of denitrification. The N2O fluxes that represented at least 0.1% of available inorganic N exhibited a weak negative relationship with C:N ratios of litter in fertilized/hayed plots, suggesting that the lower C:N ratios associated the shift to C3 plants with fertilization may promote soil N2O production, in addition to SOC and inorganic N availability. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","Fertilization; Grassland; Haying; N2O; Soil organic carbon","C3 plant; carbon; concentration (composition); denitrification; fertilizer application; flux measurement; grassland; microbial activity; nitrous oxide; nutrient availability; organic carbon; plant residue; soil moisture; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649192965

It is usually assumed that microbial activity in the filter body of constructed wetlands, responsible for the removal of carbon and nitrogen, relies mainly on bacterially mediated transformations. However, little quantitative information is available on the distribution of bacterial biomass and production in the ""black-box"" constructed wetland. The spatial distribution of bacterial carbon utilization, based on bacterial 14C-leucine incorporation measurements, was investigated for the filter body of planted and unplanted indoor pilot-scale constructed wetlands, as well as for a planted outdoor constructed wetland. A simple mass-balance approach was applied to explain the bacterially catalysed organic matter degradation in this system by comparing estimated bacterial carbon utilization rates with simultaneously measured carbon reduction values. The pilot-scale constructed wetlands proved to be a suitable model system for investigating microbial carbon utilization in constructed wetlands. Under an ideal operating mode, the bulk of bacterial productivity occurred within the first 10 cm of the filter body. Plants seemed to have no significant influence on productivity and biomass of bacteria, as well as on wastewater total organic carbon removal. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This protracted drought is particularly noticeable in those parts of South Australia and Victoria which experience a winter (May through October) rainfall peak. For the most part, the recent meteorological drought has affected the first half of the rainfall season May-June-July (MJJ), while rainfall during the second half August-September- October (ASO) has been much closer to the long term average. The recent multi-year drought is without precedent in the instrumental record, and is qualitatively similar to the abrupt decline in rainfall which was observed in the southwest of Western Australia in the 1960 and 1970s. Using a statistical downscaling technique, the rainfall decline is linked to observed changes in large-scale atmospheric fields (mean sea level pressure and precipitable water). This technique is able to reproduce the statistical properties of rainfall in southeast Australia, including the interannual variability and longer time-scale changes. This has revealed that the rainfall recent decline may be explained by a shift to higher pressures and lower atmospheric precipitable water in the region. To explore the likely future evolution of rainfall in southeast Australia under human induced climate change, the same statistical downscaling technique is applied to five climate models forced with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. This reveals that average rainfall in the region is likely to decline in the future as greenhouse gas concentrations increase, with the greatest decline occurring during the first half of winter. Projected declines vary amongst models but are generally smaller than the recent early winter rainfall deficits. In contrast, the rainfall decline in late winter-spring is larger in future projections than the recent rainfall deficits have been. We illustrate the consequences of the observed and projected rainfall declines on water supply to the major city of Melbourne, using a simple rainfall run-off relationship. This suggests that the water resources may be dramatically affected by future climate change, with percentage reductions approximately twice as large as corresponding changes in rainfall. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.",,"Climate change; Drought; Greenhouse gases; Mathematical models; Sea level; Water; Statistical downscaling technique; Winter rainfall; Rain; drought; greenhouse gas; rainfall; statistical analysis; water supply; winter; Australasia; Australia; Melbourne; Victoria [Australia]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37549036295

It also determines CO2 intensity cuts that would be required in those countries and regions if the emission reductions were to be achieved through intensity-based targets without curtailing their expected economic growth. Considering that the stabilization of CO2 concentrations at 450 ppm requires the global trend of CO2 emissions to be reversed before 2030, this study develops two scenarios: reversing the global CO2 trend in (i) 2020 and (ii) 2025. The study shows that global CO2 emissions would be limited at 42 percent above 1990 level in 2030 if the increasing trend of global CO2 emissions were to be reversed by 2020. If reversing the trend is delayed by 5 years, global CO2 emissions in 2030 would be 52 percent higher than the 1990 level. The study also finds that to achieve these targets while maintaining expected economic growth, the global average CO2 intensity would require a 68 percent drop from the 1990 level or a 60 percent drop from the 2004 level by 2030. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

To have a better understanding of the role of photosynthetic stems in carbon fixation for tropical deserts, it is important to extend our studies into areas with different ecological conditions. This study compared the photosynthetic capacity, and seasonal variation of gas exchange of leaves and stems of Justicia californica, in the southern Sonoran Desert. It also compared their relative contribution to carbon gain, and their photosynthetic response to seasonal changes in xylem tension and vapor pressure deficit (VPD). Leaves and stems showed the same photosynthetic capacity and similar diurnal patterns of A and gs during the rainy season. VPD and water potential influenced the diurnal and seasonal patterns of A and gs, and their influence was different for leaves and stems. Stems were less sensitive to water stress than leaves. The relative contribution of stems and leaves to whole canopy carbon gain, depended mainly on the variation of their photosynthetic areas. On a year-round basis, leaves contributed 77% and stems 23% of the carbon gain. However, stems were the only source of carbon gain for about 7 months. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This article offers an appraisal of political commitment to a CCS strategy among high-income countries in Europe and North America: Which governments are committed, and what particular interests and concerns do they seek to accommodate by supporting CCS? In order to answer these questions, new data are reported on government CCS research, development and demonstration (RD&amp;D) budgets. RD&amp;D budgets divided by GDP is used as an indicator of political commitment, and explanations are sought for cross-national differences. The analysis shows that fossil fuels reserves and extraction within a country has a very strong bearing on funding levels. Likely explanations include the potential for combining CCS with enhanced resource recovery. All large economies (population &gt;50 million) have a funding program. The smaller states that provide funding (Norway, Canada, the Netherlands) have the highest funding levels relative to GDP. These findings suggest that high-income petroleum producing countries are likely to be leaders in promoting CCS and a favorable regulatory environment. The fact that all large, high-income countries in the two regions now display some interest in CCS further improves its political outlook. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Climate policy; CO2 capture and storage; Comparative analysis; Fossil energy; Political commitment; RD&D budgets; Technological innovation","carbon dioxide; environmental policy; fossil fuel; mitigation; petroleum; Benelux; Canada; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; North America; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-36649018778

This is especially true in presence of conjugated π electrons where the delocalized nature of π orbitals produces long-range interactions responsible for a marked dependence of the vibrational states on the confinement. This effect is due to the finite size of the molecules as well as to chemical and/or structural defects or to the presence of nanocrystals. To model the vibrational states we adopt a semiempirical model developed in the framework of a tight binding theory for π electrons (Hückel theory). This treatment has been already successfully applied in the past to the study of the vibrational dynamics of polyynes, graphene and carbon nanotubes and it is here extended to the case of sp linear carbon chains (polyynes). It is shown that the effect of the confinement on the vibrational features is influenced by the presence of a Kohn anomaly in the limit of a cumulenic structure. This behaviour is shared by all conjugated carbon materials irrespective of the hybridization of C atoms (sp2 or sp). © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

State and non-state actors were interviewed at the 8th UNFCCC Conference of Parties (COP8) during October and November 2002. The interviews revealed that, among interviewees, climate change was already perceived to be, or was becoming a priority issue. In a number of countries substantial legislation is already in place to facilitate climate change preparedness (both adaptation and mitigation), although respondents suggest that in the majority of cases these changes are not being developed in response to the UNFCCC, but to other drivers. While all respondents saw change occurring at the national level, mostly through planning and research, few saw climate change response actions at the local level. Respondents agreed that climate risks must be managed through various mechanisms, from finding ways to participate in the Kyoto Protocol mechanisms to managing the impacts of foreign direct investments. The majority of respondents focussed on in-country actions such as identifying the most vulnerable groups, but few identified the need for greater global cooperation. To conclude, the Convention plays a role in shaping the discourse of climate change and in generating national level responses. These responses are played out differently according to the geographic, environmental, economic, social and cultural conditions of each country. The Convention is clearly important, but perhaps it is not adequate to inspire national action to resolve the problems of climate change.

Although the common hard state picture is that the accretion disk is truncated, perhaps at hundreds of gravitational radii (R9) from the black hole, recent results for the recurrent transient GX 339-4 by Miller and coworkers show evidence' for disk material very close to the black hole's innermost stable circular orbit. That work studied GX 339-4 at a luminosity of ∼5% of the Eddington limit (LEdd) and used parameters from a relativistic reflection model and the presence of a thermal component as diagnostics. Here we use similar diagnostics but extend the study to lower luminosities (2.3% and 0.8% LEdd) using Swift and RXTE observations of GX 339-4. We detect a thermal component with an inner disk temperature of ∼0.2 keV at 2.3% LEdd. At both luminosities, we detect broad features due to iron Kα that are likely related to reflection of hard X-rays off disk material. If these features are broadened by relativistic effects, they indicate that the material resides within 10Rg, and the measurements are consistent with the disk's inner radius remaining at ∼4Rg down to 0.8% LEdd. However, we also discuss an alternative model for the broadening, and we note that the evolu. tion of the thermal component is not entirely consistent with the constant inner radius interpretation. © 2008.

Location: Pampa grasslands of Argentina, between 33-41° S and 56-67° W. Methods: Modern pollen data were obtained from a pollen data base developed by the Grupo de Investigación de Paleoecología y Palinología, Universidad Nacional de Mar del Plata, Argentina (143 surface samples and 17 pollen types). Analysis of pollen and climate data involved multivariate statistics (cluster analysis and principal components analysis), scatter diagrams, Pearson's correlation and isopoll mapping. Results: Vegetation patterns at regional scales (grasslands and xerophytic woodlands) and local scales (edaphic communities) were identified by cluster analysis of pollen surface samples. The main climatic variables that appear to constrain the vegetation distribution and abundance of taxa are mean annual precipitation, annual effective precipitation and summer temperature. Individual pollen types such as Chenopodiaceae, Apiaceae, Cyperaceae, Prosopis, Schinus, Condalia microphylla and other xerophytic taxa are good indicators of moisture regime. Many pollen types are significantly correlated with summer temperature. The modern vegetation-pollen-climate relationships vary in a broadly predictable manner, supporting the contention that fossil pollen assemblages can be related to particular climatic characteristics. Main conclusions: An expanded suite of modern analogues facilitated new insights into vegetation-pollen-climate relationships at the regional scale in Pampa grasslands. Relationships between individual pollen types and climate are appraised at a regional scale and new modern analogues are presented. The results provide the basis for improved vegetation and climate reconstruction from fossil records of the study area. © 2007 The Authors.","Argentina; Climate; Isopoll maps; Modern analogue; Multivariate analysis; Palaeoecology; Pampa grasslands; Pollen analysis; Vegetation","climate effect; cluster analysis; grassland; palynology; pollen; precipitation (climatology); vegetation; Argentina; Pampas; South America; Acer pensylvanicum; Amaranthaceae; Apiaceae; Apiales; Condalia microphylla; Cyperaceae; Prosopis; Schinus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149153945

The global impact of the redistribution of water use driven by agriculture and land use change, of which CDM-AR can be a contributing factor, is a major component of ongoing global change and climate change processes. If converted to forest, large areas deemed suitable for CDM-AR would exhibit increases in actual evapotranspiration (AET) and/or decreases in runoff. Almost 20% (144 Mha) of all suitable land showed little or no impact on runoff and another 28% (210 Mha) showed only moderate impact. About 27% (200 Mha) was in the highest impact class, exhibiting an 80-100% decrease in runoff, and prevalent in drier areas (based on Aridity Index (AI)), the semi-arid tropics, and in conversion from grasslands and subsistence agriculture. Significant impacts on local hydrologic cycles were evident, however large impacts were not predicted at regional or global scale due primarily to the current limit on carbon offset projects under the Kyoto Protocol. Predicted decreases in runoff ranged from 54% in drier areas to less than 15% in more humid areas, based on four case studies located across a range of biophysical conditions and project scenarios in Ecuador and Bolivia. Factors other than climate, e.g. upstream/downstream position, were shown to be important in evaluating off-site impacts. This study demonstrates that it will become increasingly important to consider implications on local to regional water resources, and how the hydrologic dimension of CDM-AR impacts on issues of sustainability, local communities, and food security. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, we explore the information needs of California coastal managers as they begin confronting the growing risks from climate change. Through this case study we examine the challenges managers face presently, what information they use to perform their responsibilities, what additional information and other knowledge resources they may need to begin planning for climate change. We place our study into the broader context of the study of how science can best support policy-makers and resource managers as they begin to plan and prepare for adaptation to climate change. Based on extensive interview and survey research in the state, we find that managers prefer certain types of information and information sources and would benefit from various learning opportunities (in addition to that information) to make better use of available global change information. Coastal managers are concerned about climate change and willing to address it in their work, but require financial and technical assistance from other agencies at the state and federal level to do so. The study illustrates the strong need for boundary organizations to serve various intermediary functions between science and practice, especially in the context of adaptation to global climate change impacts. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

In a regional case study about automotive, rail and commercial vehicle firms in Southern Germany it is found that integrated environmental product innovation is driven by factors such as regulatory pressure, the search for competitive advantages and technological lead as well as customer pressure. Regulatory pressure includes sector policies, such as emission standards, and wider non-sector energy conservation issues, at both national and international levels. For instance, EU directives on future use of renewable energy as well as national goals for reaching the Kyoto protocol play an important role in driving innovation. The study finds that integrated environmental product innovations driven by regulatory pressure produce similar competitiveness impacts as innovations undertaken voluntarily by companies. Such results yield supporting evidence for the so-called 'Porter hypothesis', which assumes that environmental legislation stimulates innovation and leads to 'win-win' situations - the simultaneous reduction of pollution and increase in productivity.

We investigated the decomposition over 18 months of five types of plant litter (Calluna vulgaris, Eriophorum angustifolium, Eriophorum vaginatum, Picea sitchensis and Sphagnum auriculatum) at a cutover peatland in Scotland, at three water tables. We measured changes in C, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) in the litter and used denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis to investigate changes in fungal community composition. The C content of S. auriculatum litter did not change throughout the incubation period whereas vascular plant litters lost 30-40% of their initial C. There were no differences in C losses between low and medium water tables, but losses were always significantly less at the high water table. Most litters accumulated N and E. angustifolium accumulated significant quantities of P. C, N and P were significant explanatory variables in determining changes in fungal community composition but explained <25% of the variation. Litter type was always a stronger factor than water table in determining either fungal community composition or turnover of C, N and P in litter.

This study uses fine resolution data to assess the potential changes to internationally important Arctic-alpine plant communities in three national nature reserves in the Scottish Highlands, United Kingdom. Distribution models were created for 31 species, representing a range of community types. A relationship between distribution and temperature was found for all species. These models were aggregated to explore potential future changes to each community under two Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warming scenarios for the 2080s. The results indicate that Arctic-alpine communities in these reserves could undergo substantial species turnover, even under the lower climate change scenario. For example, Racomitrium-Carex moss-heath, a distinctive community type of the British uplands, could lose suitable climate space as other communities spread uphill. These findings highlight the need to maintain these communities in an optimal condition in which they can be most resilient to such change, to monitor them for signals of change and to develop more flexible conservation policies which account for future changes in mountain protected areas. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The venture plans to construct a LNG production plant at the Altamont Landfill near Livermore, CA, to convert landfill gas into a clean vehicle fuel. The announcement touted the project for offering a unique opportunity to close the loop by fueling hundreds of collection trucks with clean fuel produced from garbage. The companies will install systems to purify and liquefy landfill gas that Waste Management collects from the natural decomposition of organic waste in landfill. When it begins operating in 2009, it will produce up to 13,000 gal/day of LNG. The DOE website states that 1.5 gal of LNG is about 1 gal equivalent of gasoline. The attraction of natural gas as a vehicle fuel in any form has always been its clean-burning nature: less CO2 going into the atmosphere. Linde's efforts are capturing and reusing landfill gas for vehicle fueling, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions by &gt; 30,000 ton/yr. In Europe, gas from another biological source appears to hold some promise. GE Energy's Jenbacher gas engine is powering the Baita del Latte farm's plant in Limena, in the north of Italy near Venice. The power plant uses biogas created by the digestion of a wet mixture of animal waste and agricultural biomass materials, such as corn and rye. The Jenbacher type J320 GS cogeneration has an installed electric-generation capacity of 1.06 Mw, with an efficiency of 40.8%. The electricity produced is supplied to the Italian power distribution network, while thermal energy is recovered and used to power the biomass digestion process, the farm's housing facilities, and cattle sheds.

Furthermore, the Government has established a ministry-level organization, National Council for Sustainable Development (NCSD), for pursuing sustainability in this country and fulfilling its responsibility as a member of the international community. In this paper, the description was thus centered on reviewing the current uses of HCFCs and its current consumption status and cleaner production measures adopted by the local industries in Taiwan, and summarizing the governmental policies on promoting HCFCs mitigation through the encouragement of regulatory, economic and financial approaches. The preliminary analyses of the achievements of HCFCs mitigation in comparison with other relevant socioeconomic statistics were also discussed in this paper. It was concluded that Taiwan was in a positive trend to mitigate HCFCs consumption in the past decade (1996-2005) under the promotion of its policy framework. Further, the successful case could be developed into a sustainable development indicator in the environmental pollution dimension, thereby providing a demonstrated example for other island and developing countries in progress toward global sustainability. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

EIS methods can be employed to investigate 'labeless' detection of analytes via impedimetric transduction. This paper describes the development of a direct immunosensor for the detection of a cell-surface protein on Listeria monocytogenes, an extremely important food-borne pathogen. L. monocytogenes are facultative anaerobic, non-sporing, Gram-positive, motile rods that employ the surface bound protein, Internalin B (InlB), to promote invasion into host cells. A recombinant form of InlB was previously cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and a panel of antibodies and antibody fragments directed against the protein were also produced. Here, we describe how a portion of the recombinant InlB protein, the F3 fragment, and an anti-InlB polyclonal antibody, were used to develop a platform for the labeless immunosensing of InlB. Sensors were fabricated by electropolymerisation of planar screen-printed carbon electrodes with polyaniline (PANI), to produce a conductive substrate. Polyclonal anti-InlB antibody was subsequently incorporated onto the PANI layer using a biotin-avidin system for site-specific immobilisation. The sensors were then probed with varying concentrations of InlB antigen and the impedimetric response at each concentration was recorded. An anti-IgG antibody was immobilised at the electrode surface, as a control and subsequently exposed to the same concentrations of InlB. Impedimetric data for the control sensors were also recorded. Upon exposure to a range of concentrations of antigen, complex plane impedance analyses were used to relate the differing redox states of the polymer layer, to the possible charge transfer at the surface, with respect to the related mechanisms between the antibody and the polymer. These effects were subsequently monitored to assess the impedance of the polymer thereby determining the amount of bound antigen at the sensor surface. Calibration profiles for both sample (InlB) and control (IgG) sensors were constructed. A limit of detection of 4.1 pg/ml was achieved for Internalin B. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Materials and Methods: Articles published during 1981 to 2007 in English on renal cell carcinoma were surveyed using the MEDLINE®/PubMed® database. The subject headings included were genetics, biomarkers, prognosis and risk models of renal cell carcinoma. We present a synthesis of currently known renal cell carcinoma biomarkers at various stages of development and their clinical significance, and prognostic nomograms incorporating biomarkers. Results: The beneficiary role of biomarkers in renal cell carcinoma is challenged by the relatively low prevalence of the disease. Even if a biomarker for renal cell carcinoma had 100% sensitivity and 99.4% specificity, the positive predictive value of the marker in men older than 65 years would be only 10%. Several biomarkers are being investigated in renal cell carcinoma, of which many relate to pathogenic molecular changes that are currently therapeutic targets. Carbonic anhydrase IX is a von Hippel-Lindau mediated enzyme that is expressed in most renal cell carcinoma cases. High (greater than 85%) expression of this marker indicates favorable prognosis and may predict the response to interleukin-2 therapy. B7-H1 expression in renal cell carcinoma cells/lymphocytes may indicate worse survival, possibly through impaired host antitumor immunity. Prognostic nomograms incorporating clinical variables and molecular markers to refine the prediction of treatment outcomes are in active development and await prospective clinical validation. Conclusions: Several renal cell carcinoma molecular markers appear promising to refine the prognosis and prediction of localized, advanced or metastatic renal cell carcinoma. Currently carbonic anhydrase IX is the best studied and promising marker. Prospective, multicenter clinical validation aimed at the practical clinical usefulness of renal cell carcinoma biomarkers is warranted. © 2008 American Urological Association.","biological; carcinoma; diagnosis; kidney; prognosis; renal cell; tumor markers","aprotinin; carbonate dehydratase IX; CD40 ligand; common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen; ephrin receptor A2; ferritin; inducible nitric oxide synthase; interleukin 2; Ki 67 antigen; mammalian target of rapamycin; neopterin; neuron specific enolase; nuclear matrix protein 22; peptides and proteins; phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5 trisphosphate 3 phosphatase; protein bcl 2; protein gp200; protein p21; protein p53; pyruvate kinase; pyruvate kinase M2; STAT protein; thymidylate synthase; tissue polypeptide specific antigen; tumor marker; vinculin; cancer diagnosis; cancer risk; cancer survival; clinical feature; human; kidney carcinoma; lymphocyte; prediction; prevalence; priority journal; prognosis; protein expression; review; sensitivity and specificity; validation study; Biological Markers; Carcinoma, Renal Cell; Humans; Kidney Neoplasms; Prognosis; Proteins",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43049109844

Spatial patterns vary from nearly homogeneous to quite heterogeneous, depending on the city, parameter of interest, and the approach or method used to define spatial variability. Secondary formation, which is often regional in nature, drives fine particulate matter mass and the relevant chemical components toward high intraurban spatial homogeneity. Those particulate matter components that are dominated by primary emissions within the urban area, such as black carbon and several trace elements, tend to exhibit greater spatial heterogeneity. A variety of study designs and data analysis approaches have been used to characterize intraurban variability. High temporal correlation does not imply spatial homogeneity. For example, there can be high temporal correlation but with spatial heterogeneity manifested as smooth spatial gradients, often emanating from areas of high emissions such as the urban core or industrial zones.

This is true everywhere - and particularly in the semi-arid tropics, where over-exploitation of fragile or inherently vulnerable agro-ecosystems is leading to land and soil degradation, productivity decline, and increasing hunger and poverty. Modern crop varieties offer high yields, but the larger share of this potential yield can only be realized with good crop management. The International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), working over a vast and diverse mandate area, has learned one key lesson: that technologies and interventions must be matched not only to the crop or livestock enterprise and the biophysical environment, but also with the market and investment environment, including input supply systems and policy. Various Natural Resource Management (NRM) technologies have been developed over the years, but widespread adoption has been limited for various reasons: technical, socio-economic and institutional. To change this, ICRISAT hypothesizes that 'A research approach, founded on the need to integrate a broad consideration of technical, socio-economic and institutional issues into the generation of agricultural innovations will result in a higher level of adoption and more sustainable and diverse impacts in the rainfed systems of the semi-arid tropics.' Traditionally, crop improvement and NRM were seen as distinct but complementary disciplines. ICRISAT is deliberately blurring these boundaries to create the new paradigm of IGNRM or Integrated Genetic and Natural Resource Management. Improved varieties and improved resource management are two sides of the same coin. Most farming problems require integrated solutions, with genetic, management-related and socio-economic components. In essence, plant breeders and NRM scientists must integrate their work with that of private and public sector change agents to develop flexible cropping systems that can respond to rapid changes in market opportunities and climatic conditions. The systems approach looks at various components of the rural economy - traditional food grains, new potential cash crops, livestock and fodder production, as well as socio-economic factors such as alternative sources of employment and income. Crucially the IGNRM approach is participatory, with farmers closely involved in technology development, testing and dissemination. ICRISAT has begun to use the IGNRM approach to catalyse technology uptake and substantially improve food security and incomes in smallholder farm communities at several locations in India, Mali, Niger, Vietnam, China, Thailand and Zimbabwe. © 2008 Cambridge University Press.",,"Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149097776

In order to study CO2 storage in sub-surface formations, however, it is not feasible to perform simulations at these small scales directly and effective models for multi-phase flow description at Darcy scale are needed. Unfortunately, in many cases it is not clear how the micro-scale knowledge can rigorously be translated into consistent macroscopic equations. Here, we present a new methodology, which provides a link between Lagrangian statistics of phase particle evolution and Darcy scale dynamics. Unlike in finite-volume methods, the evolution of Lagrangian particles representing small fluid phase volumes is modeled. Each particle has a state vector consisting of its position, velocity, fluid phase information and possibly other properties like phase composition. While the particles are transported through the computational domain according to their individual velocities, the properties are modeled via stochastic processes honoring specified Lagrangian statistics. Note that the conditional expectations of the particle velocities are different for different fluid phases. The goal of this paper is to present the general framework for this alternative modeling approach. Various one and two-dimensional numerical experiments demonstrate that with appropriate stochastic rules the particle solutions are consistent with a standard two-phase Darcy flow formulation. In the end, we demonstrate how to model non-equilibrium phenomena within the stochastic particle framework, which will be the main focus of the future work. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

A diversity of behavior is found with longitude in both winter and summer, and there is a striking reversal of the sense of the wave breaking between the two seasons that is generally consistent with the difference in the jet locations.

Several studies indicate that aerosol radiative forcing is among the highest in the world over the Mediterranean in the summer. In this study, the aerosol impact (forcing) on the short-wave and long-wave fluxes, as well as the radiative heating rate due to aerosols for different altitudes in the atmosphere over Athens, Greece, was estimated using satellite data and SBDART (Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer) model. The short-wave aerosols radiative forcing at the surface in cloud-free conditions during the period 2000-2001 ranged from 10.8 to 20.1 W m-2 in the winter and from 15.2 to 16.6 W m-2 in the summer.

However, the radiative forcings of short-lived air pollutants depend on the location and source type of the precursor emissions. We apply the Goddard Institute for Space Studies atmospheric composition-climate model to quantify near-future (2030 A1B) global annual mean radiative forcing by ozone (O3) and sulfate from six emissions sectors in seven geographic regions. At 2030 the net forcings from O3, sulfate, black and organic carbon, and indirect CH4 effects for each emission sector are (in mWm-2 ) biomass burning, +95; domestic, +68; transportation, +67; industry, -131; and power, -224. Biomass burning emissions in East Asia and central and southern Africa, domestic biofuel emissions in East Asia, south Asia, and central and southern Africa, and transportation emissions in Europe and North America have large net positive forcings and are therefore attractive targets to counter global warming. Power and industry emissions from East Asia, south Asia, and north Africa and the Middle East have large net negative forcings. Therefore air quality control measures that affect these regional sectors require offsetting climate measures to avoid a warming impact. Linear relationships exist between O3 forcing and biomass burning and domestic biofuel CO precursor emissions independent of region with sensitivity of +0.2 mWm-2/TgCO. Similarly, linear relationships exist between sulfate forcing and SO2 precursor emissions that depend upon region but are independent of sector with sensitivities ranging from -3 to -12 mWm-2/TgS.

A significant share of these emissions can be avoided cost effectively through improved energy efficiency, while providing the same or higher level of energy services. How large is this emission reduction potential globally and how much will it cost for society to unlock it? This paper provides answers to these questions, presenting the results of bottom-up research conducted for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), based on the assessment of 80 country- or regional-level mitigation studies throughout the world. First, the paper analyses the findings of these studies in a common framework. Then, it aggregates their results into a global estimate of CO2 mitigation potential. The paper concludes that by 2020 it is possible to cut cost effectively approximately 29% of buildings-related global CO2 emissions, the largest among all sectors reported by the IPCC, representing a 3.2 GtCO2eq. reduction. Developing countries house the largest cost-effective potential with up to 52% of building-level emissions, whereas transition economies and industrialised countries have cost-effective potentials of up to 37% and 25%, respectively. Energy-efficient lighting was identified as the most attractive measure worldwide, in terms of both reduction potential and cost effectiveness. If this potential is realised, the building-related CO2 emissions would stay constant over 2004-2030. These stabilisation levels (if achieved by all other sectors) would cancel about 3°C temperature increase over the projected period of time. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the discussion of 'climate policy integration' has tended to focus on mitigation decisions mostly taken at international and national levels. Clearly, there is also a more locally focused adaptation dimension to climate policy integration, which has not been adequately explored by academics or policy makers. Drawing on a case study of the UK, this paper adopts both a top-down and a bottom-up perspective to explore how far different sub-elements of policies within the agriculture, nature conservation and water sectors support or undermine potential adaptive responses. The top-down approach, which assumes that policies set explicit aims and objectives that are directly translated into action on the ground, combines a content analysis of policy documents with interviews with policy makers. The bottom-up approach recognises the importance of other actors in shaping policy implementation and involves interviews with actors in organisations within the three sectors. This paper reveals that neither approach offers a complete picture of the potentially enabling or constraining effects of different policies on future adaptive planning, but together they offer new perspectives on climate policy integration. These findings inform a discussion on how to implement climate policy integration, including auditing existing policies and 'climate proofing' new ones so they support rather than hinder adaptive planning. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

CRA refers to participatory methods to assess hazards, vulnerabilities and capacities in support of community-based disaster risk reduction, used by many NGOs, community-based organizations, and the Red Cross/Red Crescent. We review the evolution of climate change adaptation and community-based disaster risk reduction, and highlight the challenges of integrating global climate change into a bottom-up and place-based approach. Our analysis of CRAs carried out by various national Red Cross societies shows that CRAs can help address those challenges by fostering community engagement in climate risk reduction, particularly given that many strategies to deal with current climate risks also help to reduce vulnerability to climate change. Climate change can also be explicitly incorporated in CRAs by making better use of CRA tools to assess trends, and by addressing the notion of changing risks. However, a key challenge is to keep CRAs simple enough for wide application. This demands special attention in the modification of CRA tools; in the background materials and trainings for CRA facilitators; and in the guidance for interpretation of CRA outcomes. A second challenge is the application of a limited set of CRA results to guide risk reduction in other communities and to inform national and international adaptation policy. This requires specific attention for sampling and care in scaling up qualitative findings. Finally, stronger linkages are needed between organizations facilitating CRAs and suppliers of climate information, particularly addressing the translation of climate information to the community level. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The European Commission's “Energy for a changing world,” in which its ambitions for a clean, secure and efficient energy policy are communicated, and the recent report by the American National Petroleum Council “Facing the hard truths about energy” share the growing concern about the development of the global energy system. The need to meet current and future energy demands within the constraints of climate change policies and the increasing insecurity of oil and gas supply has not only elevated energy to the top of the political agenda in the US and Europe, but also made energy a national priority in Asian countries such as China, India and Japan. As a result, energy policy is no longer an issue for economic policy makers alone, but has also become part of the trade, environment, foreign affairs and security policy agendas. At the same time, energy has also gained in strategic value to oil and gas producing countries, in terms of its contribution to growth, trade, income for the government and foreign direct investments in the main consumer markets. For Russia, for instance, energy has contributed to its swift come-back as a major player in international affairs, while China's energy-related ventures into Africa and elsewhere have underpinned the international and strategic nature of that country's rapid ascent as a geopolitical power. © Cambridge University Press 2008.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84927088929

Air quality has improved substantially in the United States and Western Europe in recent decades, with far less visible pollution and decreasing concentrations of several major pollutants. In large part, these gains were achieved through increasingly stringent air quality regulations. The costs associated with compliance and, importantly, the need to ensure that the regulations are achieving the intended public health benefits underscore the importance of accountability research. To date, accountability research has emphasized measuring the effects of actions already taken to improve air quality. Such research may also contribute to estimating the burden of disease that might be avoided in the future if certain actions are taken. The Health Effects Institute (HEI) currently funds eight ongoing studies on accountability, which cover near-term interventions to improve air quality including (1) a ban on the sale of coal, (2) replacing old wood stoves with cleaner ones, (3) decreasing sulfur content in fuel, (4) measures to reduce traffic, and (5) longer term, wide-ranging actions or events (such as complex changes associated with the reunification of Germany). HEI is also funding the development of methods and research to assess regulations that are implemented incrementally over extended periods of time, such as Title IV of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments, which reduces sulfur dioxide emissions from power plants in the eastern United States.

Box 47, NL-6700 AA Wageningen, Netherlands","Background: Carbon plantations are introduced in climate change policy as an option to slow the build-up of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. Here we present a methodology to evaluate the potential effectiveness of carbon plantations. The methodology explicitly considers future long-term land-use change around the world and all relevant carbon (C) fluxes, including all natural fluxes. Both issues have generally been ignored in earlier studies. Results: Two different baseline scenarios up to 2100 indicate that uncertainties in future land-use change lead to a near 100% difference in estimates of carbon sequestration potentials. Moreover, social, economic and institutional barriers preventing carbon plantations in natural vegetation areas decrease the physical potential by 75-80% or more. Nevertheless, carbon plantations can still considerably contribute to slowing the increase in the atmospheric CO2 concentration but only in the long term. The most conservative set of assumptions lowers the increase of the atmospheric CO2 concentration in 2100 by a 27 ppm and compensates for 5-7% of the total energy-related CO2 emissions. The net sequestration up to 2020 is limited, given the short-term increased need for agricultural land in most regions and the long period needed to compensate for emissions through the establishment of the plantations. The potential is highest in the tropics, despite projections that most of the agricultural expansion will be in these regions. Plantations in high latitudes as Northern Europe and Northern Russia should only be established if the objective to sequester carbon is combined with other activities. Conclusion: Carbon sequestration in plantations can play an important role in mitigating the build-up of atmospheric CO2. The actual magnitude depends on natural and management factors, social barriers, and the time frame considered. In addition, there are a number of ancillary benefits for local communities and the environment. Carbon plantations are, however, particularly effective in the long term. Furthermore, plantations do not offer the ultimate solution towards stabilizing CO2 concentrations but should be part of a broader package of options with clear energy emission reduction measures. © 2008 van Minnen et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43049125474

The main challenges to implementation of the current A/R CDM mechanisms are in (1) the definition of forest and its institutional implications, (2) the projectization that is embedded in the definition of CDM, (3) non-linear baselines related to forest transitions that complicate attribution, (4) inherent lack of synergy with other development activities and (5) high transaction costs and temporary nature of credits. In possible new international regimes that aim to include all relevant changes in land-use based emissions, a more outcome-based programmatic approach may partially replace the project cycle assessments of CDM. However, there will still be a need to assess the combination of factors and policies that can be expected to enhance terrestrial carbon storage through voluntary land-use decisions, by a combination of reduced emissions and enhanced storage. Tradeoffs usually exist between local livelihoods and carbon storage, but assessment of the opportunity costs of C sequestration requires analysis at the landscape and community scale at scenario level, including local adjustment and optimization. We explored such scenarios for a number of cases in Indonesia that range from a forest margin to a degraded lands setting. FALLOW model applications were set up for 4 landscapes in Indonesia (15-98% forest cover, 1-55% grassland, 17-51 persons km-2) to test the internal consistency of the hypothesis that farmer-led development of tree-based land-use systems in response to accessible markets, legal tenure arrangements, availability of reliable technical information and local investment can convert degraded forest lands at low public cost and form an attractive alternative to project-based interventions with detailed prescriptions and planning. The calculated (non-linear) baselines for carbon stocks varied from an average trend of -0.26 to +0.23 Mg C ha-1 year-1 over a 25 year period of assessment, equivalent to a net sequestration of -0.95 to 0.84 t CO2 ha-1 year-1 The highest value for predicted additional carbon storage in the wider landscape did not coincide with the best results for local livelihoods, but in each of the case studies the results for a 'programmatic' removal of constraints to profitable smallholder tree-based production systems was more attractive than a 'prescribed' tree planting in designated project areas. These results support the design of international modalities for an outcome-based approach to enhancing carbon storage with local flexibility in implementation. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

We found that hydrogen will not play a major role in both regions without considerable cost reductions, mainly in fuel cell technology. Also, energy taxation policy is essential for hydrogen penetration and India's lower energy taxes limit India's capacity to favour hydrogen. Once available to the (European) energy system, hydrogen can decrease the cost of CO2 emission reduction by increasing the potential for carbon capture technology. However, climate policy alone is insufficient to speed up the transition. Hydrogen diversifies energy imports; especially for Europe it decreases oil imports, while increasing imports of coal and natural gas. For India, it provides an opportunity to decrease oil imports and use indigenous coal resources in the transport sector. Hydrogen improves urban air quality by shifting emissions from urban transport to hydrogen production facilities. However, for total net emissions we found a sensitive trade-off between lower emissions at end-use (in transport) and higher emissions from hydrogen production, depending on local policy for hydrogen production facilities. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The model includes the formation of radical oxygen species (ROS) and the misassembly and aggregation of proteins when three tiers of cellular defence are insufficient: (a) direct antioxidative systems, (b) molecular damage repairing systems, and (c) compensatory chaperone synthesis. The aim of the present overview is to introduce (a) the basics of free radical and antioxidant metabolism, (b) the role of the protein quality control system in protecting cells from free radical damage and its relation to chronic diseases, (c) the basics of the ultraweak luminescence as marker of the oxidant status of biological systems, and (d) the research in human photon emission as a non-invasive marker of oxidant status in relation to chronic diseases. In considering the role of free radicals in disease, both their generation and their control by the antioxidant system are part of the story. Excessive free radical production leads to the production of heat shock proteins and chaperone proteins as a second line of protection against damage. Chaperones at the molecular level facilitate stress regulation vis-à-vis protein quality control mechanisms. The manifestation of misfolded proteins and aggregates is a hallmark of a range of neurodegenerative disorders including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amylotrophic lateral sclerosis, polyglutamine (polyQ) diseases, diabetes and many others. Each of these disorders exhibits aging-dependent onset and a progressive, usually fatal clinical course. The second part reviews the current status of human photon emission techniques and protocols for recording the human oxidative status. Sensitive photomultiplier tubes may provide a tool for non-invasive and continuous monitoring of oxidative metabolism. In that respect, recording ultraweak luminescence has been favored compared to other indirect assays. Several biological models have been used to illustrate the technique in cell cultures and organs in vivo. This initiated practical applications addressing specific human pathological issues. Systematic studies on human emission have presented information on: (a) procedures for reliable measurements, and spectral analysis, (b) anatomic intensity of emission and left-right symmetries, (c) biological rhythms in emission, (d) physical and psychological influences on emission, (e) novel physical characteristics of emission, and (f) the identification of ultraweak photon emission with the staging of ROS-related damage and disease. It is concluded that both patterns and physical properties of ultraweak photon emission hold considerable promise as measure for the oxidative status.","Antioxidants; Chaperones; Chronic disease; Free radicals; Heat shock proteins; Photon count distribution; Ultraweak photon emission","antioxidant; chaperone; free radical; heat shock protein; hydrogen peroxide; oxygen; reactive oxygen metabolite; biophysics; chemistry; gene expression regulation; heat; human; metabolism; methodology; neoplasm; oxidative stress; photon; reperfusion injury; review; Antioxidants; Biophysics; Free Radicals; Gene Expression Regulation; Heat; Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Hydrogen Peroxide; Molecular Chaperones; Neoplasms; Oxidative Stress; Oxygen; Photons; Reactive Oxygen Species; Reperfusion Injury",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50649099701

Past literature suggests that operating an engine under such lean conditions can significantly reduce NOx emissions by as much as 30% and improve fuel efficiency by as much as 5%-10%. At lean conditions, the heat release per engine cycle is not close to constant, as it is when these engines operate under stoichiometric conditions where the equivalence ratio is 1.0. A neural network controller employing output feedback has shown ability in simulation to reduce the nonlinear cyclic dispersion observed under lean operating conditions. This neural network (NN) output controller consists of three NNs: a) an NN observer to estimate the states of the engine such as total fuel and air; b) a second NN for generating virtual input; and c) a third NN for generating actual control input. The uniform ultimate boundedness of all closed-loop signals is demonstrated by using the Lyapunov analysis without using the separation principle. Persistency of the excitation condition, the certainty equivalence principle, and the linearity in the unknown parameter assumptions are also relaxed. The controller is implemented for a research engine as a program running on an embeddable PC that communicates with the engine through a custom hardware interface, and the results are similar to those observed in simulation. Experimental results at an equivalence ratio of 0.77 show a drop in NOx emissions by around 98% from stoichiometric levels with an improvement of fuel efficiency by 5%. A 30% drop in unburned hydrocarbons from uncontrolled case is observed at this equivalence ratio of 0.77. Similar performance was observed with the controller on a different engine. © 2007 IEEE.","Adaptive control; Neural network (NN) hardware; Neural networks (NNs); Neurocontrollers; Observers; Output feedback","Adaptive control systems; Control equipment; Fuel consumption; Gas emissions; Internal combustion engines; Neural networks; Nitrogen oxides; Neurocontroller; Output feedback; Feedback control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40949148702

In certain cases, high PM10 concentrations have persisted over periods of several hours, resulting in exceedences of EU target values. In order to design effective PM10 control strategies, it is essential to develop an understanding of local and remote sources of particulate matter, as well as of the factors influencing its temporal and spatial variability in urban areas. In this study, PM10 data from Athens and Birmingham were analysed for relationships to other pollutants (NOx, CO, O3 and SO2) and meteorological parameters (wind velocity, temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, solar radiation and atmospheric pressure) during a 3-year period (2001-2003). Significant positive correlations between PM10 and NOx, CO, and solar radiation were observed at the selected monitoring sites during cold seasons. On the other hand, negative correlations between PM10 and O3, wind speed and precipitation were observed during the same seasons. However, these correlations became weaker during warm seasons, probably due to secondary aerosol formation and enhanced soil dust re-suspension. Furthermore, principal component and regression analyses were used to quantify the contribution of non-combustion sources to the observed PM10 background levels. This contribution ranged between 45% and 70% in Birmingham and 41-74% in Athens. Finally, several winter and summer PM10 episodes from each city were analysed using a back trajectory model, in order to identify the origin of the polluted air masses. It was found that long-range transport of particles from continental Europe had a marked effect on PM10 background levels in Birmingham, while the local weather had a stronger influence on PM10 levels in Athens. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In vivo and combined analyses of gas-exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, and light absorbance at 830 nm were made on the adaxial and abaxial sides of juvenile and adult leaves. When adult leaves were reversed to illuminate the abaxial side, photosynthesis and isoprene emission were significantly lower than when the adaxial side was illuminated. Monoterpene emission, however, was independent on the side illuminated and similarly partitioned between the two leaf sides. The abaxial side of adult leaves showed less diffusive resistance to CO2 acquisition by chloroplasts, but also lower ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) activity, than the adaxial leaf side. In juvenile leaves, photosynthesis, isoprene, and monoterpene emissions were similar when the adaxial or abaxial side was directly illuminated. In the abaxial side of juvenile leaves, photosynthesis did not match the rates attained by the other leaf types when exposed to elevated CO2, which suggests the occurrence of a limitation of photosynthesis by ribulose bisphosphate (RuBP) regeneration. Accordingly, a reduced efficiency of both photosystems and a high non-radiative dissipation of energy was observed in the abaxial side of juvenile leaves. During light induction, the adaxial side of juvenile leaves also showed a reduced efficiency of photosystem II and a large non-radiative energy dissipation. Our report reveals distinct functional properties in Eucalyptus leaves. Juvenile leaves invest more carbon in isoprene, but not in monoterpenes, and have a lower water use efficiency than adult leaves. Under steady-state conditions, in adult leaves the isobilateral anatomy does not correspond to an equal functionality of the two sides, while in juvenile leaves the dorsiventral anatomy does not result in functional differences in primary or secondary metabolism in the two sides. However, photochemical limitations may reduce the efficiency of carbon fixation in the light, especially in the abaxial side of juvenile leaves. © 2007 German Botanical Society and The Royal Botanical Society of the Netherlands.","Eucalyptus; Fluorescence; Heteroblastic leaves; Isoprene; Monoterpenes; Photochemistry; Photosynthesis (limitations)","adult; biogenic emission; evergreen tree; gas exchange; isoprenoid; juvenile; leaf; metabolism; monoterpene; photochemistry; photosynthesis; transpiration; water use efficiency; Eucalyptus; Eucalyptus globulus; terpene; article; Eucalyptus; evapotranspiration; growth, development and aging; metabolism; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; time; volatilization; Eucalyptus; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Transpiration; Terpenes; Time Factors; Volatilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41649114884

However, data on the relationship between rhizodeposit amounts and BCC are lacking. Other soil microorganisms, e.g. arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF), may also influence BCC. We simulated foliar herbivory (cutting) to reduce belowground carbon allocation and rhizodeposition of pea plants grown either with or without AMF. This reduced soil respiration, rhizosphere microbial biomass and bacteriovorous protozoan abundance, whereas none of these were affected by AMF. After labelling plants with 13CO2, root and rhizosphere soil 13C enrichment of cut plants were reduced to a higher extent (24-46%) than shoot 13C enrichment (10-24%). AMF did not affect 13C enrichment. Despite these clear indications of reduced rhizosphere carbon-input, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) of 16S rRNA genes PCR-amplified targeting DNA and RNA from rhizosphere soil did not reveal any effects of cutting on banding patterns. In contrast, AMF induced consistent differences in both DNA- and RNA-based DGGE profiles. These results show that a reduction in rhizosphere microbial activity is not necessarily accompanied by changes in BCC, whereas AMF presence inhibits proliferation of some bacterial taxa while stimulating others. © 2008 Federation of European Microbiological Societies Published by Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","13C-labelling; Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Bacterial community composition; Defoliation; DGGE; Rhizodeposition","carbon 13; RNA 16S; arbuscular mycorrhiza; biomass; community composition; microbial activity; microbial community; rhizosphere; soil microorganism; arbuscular mycorrhiza; article; defoliation; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; enrichment culture; gene amplification; gene targeting; herbivore; microbial activity; microbial biomass; microbial community; nonhuman; pea; polymerase chain reaction; population abundance; priority journal; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; rhizosphere; soil respiration; Bacteria; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Carbon Isotopes; Ecosystem; Electrophoresis; Fungi; Mycorrhizae; Peas; Plant Roots; Soil Microbiology; Arbuscular; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Pisum sativum; Protozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549083407

The methods presented and conclusions are the products of a workshop entitled ""Estimation of Biomass and Carbon Stocks: the Case of Atlantic Rain Forest"". Aboveground biomass (AGB) in tropical forests is mainly contained in trees. Tree biomass is a function of wood volume, obtained from the diameter and height, architecture and wood density (dry weight per unit volume of fresh wood). It can be quantified by the direct (destructive) or indirect method where the biomass quantification is estimated using mathematical models. The allometric model can be site specific when elaborated to a particular ecosystem or general that can be used in different sites. For the Atlantic Forest, despite the importance of it, there are only two direct measurements of tree biomass, resulting in allometric models specific for this ecosystem. To select one or other of the available models in the literature to estimate AGB it is necessary take into account what is the main question to be answered and the ease with which it is possible to measure the independent variables in the model. Models that present more accurate estimates should be preferred. However, more simple models (those with one independent variable, usually DBH) can be used when the focus is monitoring the variation in carbon storage through the time. Our observations in the Atlantic Forest suggest that pan-tropical relations proposed by Chave et al. (2005) can be confidently used to estimated tree biomass across biomes as long as tree diameter (DBH), height, and wood density are accounted for in the model. In Atlantic Forest, we recommend the quantification of biomass of lianas, bamboo, palms, tree ferns and epiphytes, which are an important component in this ecosystem. This paper is an outcome of the workshop entitled ""Estimation of Biomass and Carbon Stocks: the Case of Atlantic Rain Forest"", that was conducted at Ubatuba, São Paulo, Brazil, between 4 and 8 December 2006 as part of the Brazilian project ""Ombrophylus Dense Forest floristic composition, structure and function at the Núcleos Picinguaba and Santa Virginia of the Serra do Mar State Park"", BIOTA Gradiente.","Above-ground biomass; Allometric model; Atlantic Forest; Carbon; Mata Atlântica","Chamaedorea seifrizii; Filicophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-50449099566

They are salinity stratified and have deep thermal maxima that persist throughout the year at temperatures up to 60°C above the winter minimum in the overlying atmosphere. Heat transfer in one of these lakes (Lake A, latitude 83.0°N, longitude 75.4°W) was simulated using a high spatial resolution model based on a one-dimensional heat diffusion and radiative transfer equation, which was solved through numerical integration. Boundary conditions were forced using climate data from an automated weather station installed next to the lake. There was a good fit between simulated and observed water column temperatures, including the midwater temperature maximum of 8.5°C, after 63 years of heating (RMSE = 0.10°C). This suggests that Lake A became ice-free in the 1940s, a known period of intense warming of the circumpolar Arctic. The model was sensitive to forcing by photosynthetically active radiation (PAR, 400-700 nm), in addition to optically related parameters such as surface reflectance, snow and ice cover, and the PAR diffuse attenuation coefficient. The unusual thermal structure is affected by stratified layers of pigmented microbial communities, which enhance the absorption of solar radiation. Simulation of ice-free summers revealed that the lake's thermal profile would lose its characteristic shape over several decades and that ongoing climate change could reduce the thermal maximum from 8.5° to 4°C within 50 years.

In general, peat forms when the amount of photosythetically produced organic matter exceeds the loss of organic matter through decomposition. About 30% of the world's terrestrial soil carbon is found in peatland ecosystems. Peatlands are most common across the boreal and subarctic zones of the Northern Hemisphere. Peatlands are strongly influenced by hydrology, chemistry, and associated flora and vegetation, and occur as two types: fens and bogs. Fens are peatlands that are minerotrophic, while bogs are ombrotrophic. Bogs and poor fens are acidic and dominated by peat mosses (Sphagnum), while rich fens are basic and dominated by true mosses, the remains of which are usually the most abundant component of the undecomposed peat. Important processes that occur in peatlands are (1) acidification, (2) water retention, (3) oligotrophification (or nutrient sequestration), (4) methane production, and (5) sulfate reduction. Peatlands have initiated across the boreal region of the world during the past 10 000-12 000 years and presently form a substantial sink for the world's carbon. However, recent estimates of disturbance to these northern ecosystems indicate that the abilities of peatlands to continue sequestering carbon may be greatly reduced. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

Relatively ''soft'' law often garners widespread participation, but it creates few concrete incentives for states to improve behavior. ''Harder'' commitments make shirking more difficult, but these institutional features may deter from joining the very states whose practices are least consistent with the treaty's requirements. Empirical analyses of ratification of the core agreements of the climate change regime support these propositions. Flexibility provisions provide one mechanism for states to mitigate this dilemma. The findings with regard to one flexibility mechanism strongly support this argument. The results with regard to a second flexibility mechanism, however, tend to follow an opposite pattern. The author offers a preliminary interpretation of this finding.

At temperatures above 240°C, the cyanide ligand acts as a reducing agent and reduces the metal centers to lower oxidation states. To understand the mechanism of the autoreduction, the thermal reduction of the Pd-Co cyanogel system formed by the reaction of PdCl4 2- and Co(CN)63- was studied in an inert atmosphere. It was found that the reduction proceeds through two polymeric cyanide-containing intermediates, CoPd(CN)4 and Pd(CN)2, that form upon reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ and involves a significant rearrangement of the coordination structure. The two intermediates upon further heating reduce to metallic products, which by solid-state diffusion form a single Pd/Co alloy product. CoPd(CN)4 was found to have a hydrated form Co(H2O)2Pd(CN)4·4H 2O with a layered structure crystallizing in an orthorhombic Pnma space group. The Pt-Co cyanogel was found to autoreduce via a similar route. CoPt(CN)4 was confirmed as an intermediate.

The obtained experimental data were compared with results of layer Korringa - Kohn - Rostoker calculations. We found that around k points, where the two-dimensional QW bands cross the projected bulk bands of the W substrate of the same symmetry, broad hybridization gaps in the QW distributions are observed. Careful analysis based on a symmetry approach for the electronic bands in the Ag monolayer and the W substrate suggests that respective gaps may generally be taken as a fingerprint for the interaction with substrate states of even parity with respect to the emission plane.

A range of fuel molecule types are currently under consideration: alcohols, ethers, esters, isoprenes, alkenes and alkanes. At the present, the major alcohol biofuel is ethanol. The ethanol fermentation is an old technology. Ongoing efforts aim to increase yield and energy efficiency of ethanol production from biomass. n-Butanol, another microbial fermentation product, is potentially superior to ethanol as a fuel but suffers from low yield and unwanted side-products currently. In general, biodiesel fuels consist of fatty acid methyl esters in which the carbon derives from plants, not microbes. A new biodiesel product, called microdiesel, can be generated in engineered bacterial cells that condense ethanol with fatty acids. Perhaps the best fuel type to generate from biomass would be biohydrocarbons. Microbes are known to produce hydrocarbons such as isoprenes, long-chain alkenes and alkanes. The biochemical mechanisms of microbial hydrocarbon biosynthesis are currently under study. Hydrocarbons and minimally oxygenated molecules may also be produced by hybrid chemical and biological processes.

Here we provide a realistic assessment of the theory that the basal regions of the ice sheets that formed over North America and Europe during glaciations were host to significant populations of anaerobic microorganisms, including methanogens, able to metabolize organic carbon sequestered during interglacials and overridden during Quaternary glacials. In doing so, we review the current evidence for subglacial. methane release during deglaciation, estimate the size of the subglacial. reservoir of organic carbon (SOC), and assess the amount of SOC available to subglacial microbes and the likely pathways and rates of carbon turnover. We then discuss the fate of subglacial methane and the potential impact of its release on atmospheric methane concentrations. We calculate that the SOC equates to 418-610 Pg C and includes carbon from terrestrial soils/vegetation, peatlands, lake, and marine sediments. The SOC that is potentially available for microbial conversion to methane is smaller than this estimate due to (1) glacial erosion, (2) accumulation of recalcitrant organic carbon compounds over time, (3) conversion to carbon dioxide by aerobic/anaerobic respiration, and (4) incomplete conversion of labile organic matter to methane. We estimate that the total SOC available for conversion to methane is 63 Pg C. Our estimates of methane production potentials span a wide range because of the current uncertainty surrounding subglacial metabolic rates. We believe, however, that there is a strong likelihood that subglacial microbes could convert 63 Pg of SOC to methane during a glacial cycle. If this were the case, release of this methane from the ice sheet margins during retreat would need to be episodic in order to significantly impact atmospheric methane concentrations. Our findings suggest that it may well be important to consider subglacial environments as active components of the Earth's carbon cycle. Conclusive determination of the potential impact of subglacial methane production on atmospheric methane concentrations during deglaciation, however, awaits more precise determination of the ability of subglacial microbes to degrade organic carbon components and their associated rates of metabolism under in situ conditions.

These measures were implemented by Hampshire County Council, Stagecoach Bus Company and Winchester City Council as part of the EU-sponsored CIVITAS MIRACLES project which ran from 2002 to 2006 and whose aims included reducing the environmental impact of transport at the local level while increasing urban accessibility. It follows on from a previous paper published in Transport Policy in 2007 looking at the success of measures implemented in Winchester to improve bus service quality and information. These implemented measures included the introduction of 13 new Euro III buses, re-powering 10 older buses from Euro I to Euro III standard, adding particulate traps to four Euro II buses and the demonstration of two different diesel/electric hybrid buses during two week-long trials in 2003 and 2004 along the Park and Ride route. In order to evaluate the effects of these measures, data was collected from the bus operator Stagecoach regarding their fleet of 59 vehicles in Winchester. This included their emission standard, reliability, average age and smoke test results. Emission modelling was carried out using a vehicle activity model on a key city centre street to assess emissions savings as a result of the implemented measures. In addition, two bus questionnaire surveys were carried out to assess passenger's views of the two diesel/electric hybrid buses used during the trials. Conclusions and recommendations have been made with regard to the environmental impact of the cleaner Winchester bus fleet and the contribution it has made to reducing emissions from motor vehicles in the Winchester central area. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

This is evidenced by the facts that agriculture produces the lion's share of GDP (greater than 30 percent) in most African countries and more than 60 percent of the employment for the rural population. The importance of biodiversity for socio-economic development is even more critical in the Ethiopian context. For instance, about 85 percent of the rural population of Ethiopia depends directly on agriculture, which again contributes 85 percent of exports mainly generated from coffee, skin, and hides. It is also reported that 45 percent of the country's GDP is contributed by the agricultural sector. The overwhelming majority of the rural population of Ethiopia, about 80 percent, depends on herbal medicine. The noneconomic aspects of biodiversity use, such as global climate regulation, hydrological regime, oxygen production, and so on, are vital components of biodiversity. However, these resources are being lost at an unprecedented level and would put the life-support systems of these nations at stake. Despite their multiple ecological functions and immense uses for socioeconomic development, the country's biodiversity resources are being destroyed in critical proportions. The large-scale destruction of the forest resources is clear evidence. Nearly 40 percent of the country's total area was covered with forests at the beginning of the twentieth century.

In order to understand the causes of the low accuracy in the current prediction of the A-AM precipitation, this study strives to determine to what extent the ten state-of-the-art coupled atmosphere-ocean-land climate models and their multi-model ensemble (MME) can capture the two observed major modes of A-AM rainfall variability - which account for 43% of the total interannual variances during the retrospective prediction period of 1981-2001. The first mode is associated with the turnabout of warming to cooling in the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), whereas the second mode leads the warming/cooling by about 1 year, signaling precursory conditions for ENSO. The first mode has a strong biennial tendency and reflects the Tropical Biennial Oscillation (Meehl in J Clim 6:31-41, 1993). We show that the MME 1-month lead prediction of the seasonal precipitation anomalies captures the first two leading modes of variability with high fidelity in terms of seasonally evolving spatial patterns and year-to-year temporal variations, as well as their relationships with ENSO. The MME shows a potential to capture the precursors of ENSO in the second mode about five seasons prior to the maturation of a strong El Niño. However, the MME underestimates the total variances of the two modes and the biennial tendency of the first mode. The models have difficulties in capturing precipitation over the maritime continent and the Walker-type teleconnection in the decaying phase of ENSO, which may contribute in part to a monsoon ""spring prediction barrier"" (SPB). The NCEP/CFS model hindcast results show that, as the lead time increases, the fractional variance of the first mode increases, suggesting that the long-lead predictability of A-AM rainfall comes primarily from ENSO predictability. In the CFS model, the correlation skill for the first principal component remains about 0.9 up to 6 months before it drops rapidly, but for the spatial pattern it exhibits a drop across the boreal spring. This study uncovered two surprising findings. First, the coupled models' MME predictions capture the first two leading modes of precipitation variability better than those captured by the ERA-40 and NCEP-2 reanalysis datasets, suggesting that treating the atmosphere as a slave may be inherently unable to simulate summer monsoon rainfall variations in the heavily precipitating regions (Wang et al. in J Clim 17:803-818, 2004). It is recommended that future reanalysis should be carried out with coupled atmosphere and ocean models. Second, While the MME in general better than any individual models, the CFS ensemble hindcast outperforms the MME in terms of the biennial tendency and the amplitude of the anomalies, suggesting that the improved skill of MME prediction is at the expense of overestimating the fractional variance of the leading mode. Other outstanding issues are also discussed. © Springer-Verlag 2007.","Asian-Australian monsoon; Biennial tendency; Coupled atmosphere-ocean-land climate model; Dominant mode of rainfall variability; ENSO predictability; MME one-month lead prediction; NCEPCFS","accuracy assessment; annual variation; atmosphere-ocean coupling; climate modeling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; ensemble forecasting; monsoon; performance assessment; precipitation assessment; prediction; principal component analysis; seasonal variation; Walker circulation; weather forecasting; Asia; Australasia; Australia; Eurasia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41449088188

A large proportion of biosolids are currently landfilled. With increasing pressure from regulators and the general public, landfilling of biosolids is being phased out in many countries because of potential secondary pollution caused by leachate and the emission of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Biosolids contain nutrients and energy that can be used beneficially. Significant efforts have been made recently to develop new technologies to manage biosolids and make useful products from them. In this paper, we provide a review of the technologies in biosolids management. Materials and methods: A survey of literature was conducted. Results: At present, the most common beneficial use of biosolids is agricultural land application because of inherent fertilizer values found in biosolids. Expansion of land application, however, may be limited in the future because of more stringent regulatory requirements and public concern about food chain contamination in some countries. Perceived as a green energy source, the combustion of biosolids has received renewed interest. Anaerobic digestion is generally a more effective method than incineration for energy recovery, and digested biosolids are suitable for further beneficial use through land application. Although conventional incineration systems for biosolid management generally consume more energy than they produce because of the high moisture content in the biosolids, it is expected that more combustion systems, either monocombustion or cocombustion, will be built to cope with the increasing quantity of biosolids. Discussion: Under the increasingly popular low-carbon economy policy, biosolids may be recognized as a renewable fuel and be eligible for 'carbon credits'. Because ash can be used to manufacture construction materials, combustion can provide a complete management for biosolids. A number of advanced thermal conversion technologies (e.g., supercritical water oxidation process and pyrolysis) are under development for biosolids management with a goal to generate useful products, such as higher quality fuels and recovery of phosphorus. With an ever-increasing demand for renewable energy, growing bioenergy crops and forests using biosolids as a fertilizer and soil amendment can not only contribute to the low-carbon economy but also maximize the nutrient and carbon value of the biosolids. Conclusions: Land application of biosolids achieves a complete reuse of its nutrients and organic carbon at a relatively low cost. Therefore, land application should become a preferred management option where there is available land, the quality of biosolids meet regulatory requirements, and it is socially acceptable. Intensive energy cropping and forest production using biosolids can help us meet the ever-increasing demand for renewable energy, which can eliminate the contamination potential for food sources, a common social concern about land application of biosolids. In recent years, increasing numbers of national and local governments have adopted more stringent regulations toward biosolid management. Under such a political climate, biosolids producers will have to develop multireuse strategies for biosolids to avoid being caught because a single route management practice might be under pressure at a short notice. Conventional incineration systems for biosolids management generally consume more energy than they produce and, although by-products may be used in manufacturing, this process cannot be regarded as a beneficial use of biosolids. However, biosolids are likely to become a source of renewable energy and produce 'carbon credits' under the increasingly popular, low-carbon economy policy. Recommendations and perspectives: To manage biosolids in a sustainable manner, there is a need for further research in the following areas: achieving a higher degree of public understanding and acceptance for the beneficial use of biosolids, developing cost-efficient and effective thermal conversions for direct energy recovery from biosolids, advancing technology for phosphorus recovery, and selecting or breeding crops for efficient biofuel production. © 2008 Springer-Verlag.","Anaerobic digestion; Bioenergy; Biosolids; Cocombustion; Energy recovery; Land application; Phosphorus recovery; Sewage sludge; Waste","carbon; fertilizer; methane; phosphorus; anoxic conditions; biofuel; biosolid; combustion; cost-benefit analysis; economic policy; energy use; incineration; leachate; recycling; sewage; sludge; soil amendment; waste management; waste treatment; wastewater; anaerobic growth; chemistry; city; crop; economics; energy resource; environmental protection; gas; greenhouse effect; incineration; isolation and purification; metabolism; methodology; microbiology; review; sewage; soil pollutant; time; tree; waste management; Anaerobiosis; Carbon; Cities; Conservation of Natural Resources; Crops, Agricultural; Energy-Generating Resources; Fertilizers; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Incineration; Methane; Phosphorus; Sewage; Soil Pollutants; Time Factors; Trees; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-45849138515

In this paper, the possible factors of sludge reduction such as sludge decay, uncoupled metabolism, and anaerobic oxidation with low sludge production were discussed in the OSA process. It has been confirmed that sludge decay is the decisive cause in the OSA process, accounting for 66.7% of sludge production reduction. Sludge decay includes hydrolysis and acidogenesis of dead microorganisms and particle organic carbon adsorbed in sludge floc and endogenous metabolism. By batch experiments, it has been proven that there is energetic uncoupling in the OSA system since microorganisms were exposed to alternative anaerobic and aerobic environment. It accounts for about 7.5% of sludge production reduction. Soluble chemical oxygen demand (SCOD) released from the anaerobic sludge tank in the OSA process was used as the substrate for cryptic growth. The substrate was used for anoxic denitrifying, anaerobic phosphorus release, sulfate reduction, and methane production. These anaerobic reactions in the sludge anaerobic tank have lower sludge production than in the aerobic oxidation when equivalent SCOD is consumed, which may lead to approximately 23% of sludge reduction in the OSA process.

However, the magnitude of this effect is unclear. We examined the effect of low and high inputs of methamidophos on the structure of the soil microbial community, and the catabolic activity and the genetic diversity of the bacterial community using the polyphasic approaches of microbial biomass, phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), community-level catabolic profiles (CLCPs), and amplified ribosomal DNA restriction analysis (ARDRA) patterns. Our results indicated that high methamidophos inputs significantly reduced total microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) and fungal biomass, but increased Gram-negative bacteria with no significant effects on the Gram-positive bacteria. Interestingly, CLCPs patterns showed that high methamidophos inputs also significantly improved the catabolic activity of Gram-negative bacteria. The ARDRA pattern showed that the genetic diversity of the bacterial community decreased under chemical stress. Furthermore, changes in the microbial parameters examined were less significant under low inputs than high inputs of methamidophos, suggesting a dosage effect of methamidophos on the microbial community. Our results provide the first evidence that methamidophos differentially affected components of the soil microbial community through inhibiting fungal growth but enhancing the biomass and catabolic activity of Gram-negative bacteria. © 2007.","ARDRA; CLCPS; Diversity; Methamidophos; PLFA; Soil microbial community","Biomass; Fungi; Genes; Microorganisms; Toxicity; Fungal biomass; Methamidophos; Organophosphate pesticides; Soil microbial community; Pesticides; biochemistry; catabolism; community structure; genetic variation; insecticide; microbial community; nucleic acid analysis; organophosphate; phospholipid; soil microorganism; toxicity; Bacteria (microorganisms); Fungi; Negibacteria; Posibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37449024168

The model system consists of the non-hydrostatic mesoscale meteorological model (MM5) and a tropospheric chemical and transport model (TCTM) with the updated carbon-bond chemical reaction mechanism (CBM-IV). The spatial resolution of the system domain is 30 km × 30 km. The impacts of biogenic emissions are investigated by performing simulations (36 h) with and without biogenic emissions, while anthropogenic emissions are constant. The results indicate that biogenic emissions have remarkable impacts on surface ozone in eastern China. In big cities and their surrounding areas, surface ozone formation tends to be VOC-limited. The increase in ozone concentration by biogenic VOC is generally 5 ppbv or less, but could be more than 10 ppbv or even 30 ppbv in some local places. The impacts of biogenic NOx are different or even contrary in different regions, depending on the relative availability of NOx and VOC. The surface ozone concentrations reduced or increased by the biogenic NOx could be as much as 10 ppbv or 20 ppbv, respectively. The impacts of biogenic emissions on ozone aloft are generally restricted to the boundary layer and generally more obvious during the daytime than during the nighttime. This study is useful for understanding the role of biogenic emissions and for planning strategies for surface ozone abatement in eastern China. Due to limitations of the emission inventories used and the highly non-linear nature of zone formation, however, some uncertainties remain in the results. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The energy efficiency promotion of CCHP systems results in emission reduction compared to the conventional methods of generating heat and electricity separately. And as a distributed energy resource, CCHP systems also increase in the reliability of the energy supply. With the overall development of CCHP systems and related technologies, the utilization of micro CCHP systems in the residential sector is emerged as a growing potential.

Although the Xa mutant had a CO2 assimilation rate similar to that of Ailsa Craig, it exhibited a much larger stomatal conductance (g s) than Ailsa Craig. Decreased electron flux in PS2 (J PS2) for the Xa mutant was associated with electron flux for photorespiratory carbon oxidation (J o) and alternative electron flux in PS2 (J a) while electron flux for photosynthetic carbon reduction (J c) was not different from Ailsa Craig.

However, a recent study reported aerobic CH4 emission from plants by an unrecognized process, a result that has since been questioned. We investigated CH4 emissions under aerobic conditions from aboveground tissues of 44 species indigenous to the temperate Inner Mongolia steppe. Ten herbaceous hydrophytes (wetland-adapted plants) were examined, two of which - Glyceria spiculosa and Scirpus yagara - emitted CH4 from stems but not from detached leaves. Of 34 xerophytes (arid-adapted plants) examined, 7 out of 9 shrub species emitted CH4 from detached leaves but not stems, whereas none of 25 herbaceous xerophytes emitted CH4. The herbaceous hydrophyte, S. yagara, emitted highly 13C-depleted CH4, suggesting a microbial origin. Achillea frigida exhibited the highest CH 4 emission rates among the shrubs and continuously emitted relatively 13C-enriched CH4 from detached leaves, indicating that CH4 was derived directly from plant tissues under aerobic conditions. Because woody species are relatively rare in the Inner Mongolia steppe, aerobic, plant-derived CH4 emission is probably negligible in this region. Our results may imply a larger role for aerobic CH4 production in upland ecosystems dominated by woody species or in ecosystems where woody encroachment is occurring as a result of global change. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Ecosystems; Metabolism; Methane; Microorganisms; Tissue; Herbaceous hydrophytes; Plant tissues; Particulate emissions; methane; Ecosystems; Metabolism; Methane; Microorganisms; Particulate emissions; Tissue; global change; herb; metabolism; methane; oxic conditions; shrub; Achillea frigida; aerobic capacity; article; ecosystem; global change; Glyceria spiculosa; microbial metabolism; plant; plant leaf; plant stem; Scirpus yagara; woody plant; Aerobiosis; Air Pollutants; Carbon Isotopes; Environmental Monitoring; Methane; Mongolia; Plants; Asia; Eurasia; Far East; Mongolia; Achillea; Glyceria; Scirpus; Xerophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37549007619

A variety of ptC-containing examples, some with more than one ptC, have been designed computationally by elaborating the planar C(BeH)42- prototype at B3LYP/6-311++G(3df,2p) and MP2/6-311++G(3df,2p) levels of theory for some small ptC representatives. The prototype prefers a D2h paramagnetic triplet ground state due to Hund's rule, rather than a singlet. The highly polarized C-Be bonding weakens the rigidity of the tetrahedral carbon in Td C(BeH)4 enormously, and the enhancement of both C-Be and Be4 peripheral covalent bonding exerted by the extra electrons stabilizes the ptC eventually. The delocalization of the two pπ electrons is only modest, but their density on the most electronegative carbon atom helps stabilize the ptC arrangement. This is in contrast to the conventional strategy to delocalize pπ lone pairs for stabilizing the ptC arrangement.

The results show that there was a significant positive linear relationship between the concentrations measured by the TEOM and gravimetric TSP samplers (p-values < 0.001). It was observed that in general, the TEOM samplers reported lower TSP concentrations than the collocated gravimetric TSP sampler. Further investigation into these results indicated that the difference in the concentration measured by the TEOM sampler versus the gravimetric TSP sampler (known as the TEOM measurement error) is correlated with the concentration measured by the gravimetric TSP sampler, but the nature of that relationship varies by location. However, linear relationships were observed between the measurement error of the TEOM samplers and the mass median diameter and geometric standard deviation of the collocated gravimetric TSP sample.","Air sampler; Measurement error; Particle size distribution; TEOM; TSP","Concentration intensity; Particulate matter (PM) monitoring systems; Tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM); Air quality; Concentration (process); Gravimetric analysis; Particle size; Sampling; Particles (particulate matter); air quality; atmospheric pollution; comparative study; data processing; error analysis; gravimetry; measurement method; particle size; particulate matter; sampler; size distribution; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-41749099466

Radio-isotopes were used to estimate sediment mixing and accumulation rates, and benthic chamber and pore water measurements were used to determine sediment-water exchange fluxes of oxygen, nutrients and metals, and infer carbon oxidation rates. Using 7Be and 234ThXS, the sediment-mixing coefficient (Db) was 4.3 ± 1.8 cm2 y-1, a value that lies at the lower limit for marine environments, indicating that mixing was not important in these sediments at this time. Sediment accumulation rates (Sa), estimated using 137Cs and 210PbXS, were 0.16 ± 0.02 g cm-2 y-1. The supply rate of organic carbon to the sediment-water interface was 30 ± 3.9 mmol C m-2 d-1, of which ∼10% or 2.9 ± 0.44 mmol C m-2 d-1was lost from the system through burial below the 1-cm thick surface mixed layer. Measured fluxes of O2 were 26 ± 3.8 mmol m-2 d-1 and equated to a carbon oxidation rate of 20 ± 3.3 mmol C m-2 d-1, which is an upper limit due to the potential for oxidation of additional reduced species. Using organic carbon gradients in the surface mixed layer, carbon oxidation was estimated at 2.6 ± 1.1 mmol C m-2 d-1. Independent estimates made using pore water concentration gradients of ammonium and C:N stoichiometry, equaled 2.8 ± 0.46 mmol C m-2 d-1. The flux of DOC out of the sediments (DOCefflux) was 5.6 ± 1.3 mmol C m-2 d-1. In general, while mass balance was achieved indicating the sediments were at steady state during this time, changes in environmental conditions within the bay and the surrounding area, mean this conclusion might not always hold. These results show that the majority of carbon oxidation occurred at the sediment-water interface, via O2 reduction. This likely results from the high frequency of sediment resuspension events combined with the shallow sediment mixing zone, leaving anaerobic oxidants responsible for only ∼10-15% of the carbon oxidized in these sediments. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Key to this development is the supporting software infrastructure, SoftIAM. Through it, CIAS is distributed between the communities of institutions which has each contributed modules to the CIAS system. At the heart of SoftIAM is the Bespoke Framework Generator (BFG) which enables flexibility in the assembly and composition of individual modules from a pool to form coupled models within CIAS, and flexibility in their deployment onto the available software and hardware resources. Such flexibility greatly enhances modellers' ability to re-configure the CIAS coupled models to answer different questions, thus tracking evolving policy needs. It also allows rigorous testing of the robustness of IA modelling results to the use of different component modules representing the same processes (for example, the economy). Such processes are often modelled in very different ways, using different paradigms, at the participating institutions.

We documented latitudinal variation in species composition of the tettigoniid grasshopper fauna of Atlantic Coast salt marshes. Tettigoniids (N=740 adults) were collected from the Spartina alterniflora zone of 31 salt marsh sites across a latitudinal range of 13.19° (Florida to Maine), with an additional 52 individuals collected from the Juncus roemerianus zone of low-latitude marshes for comparative purposes. Eight species were collected, but some were common only at a few sites or rare throughout the entire collection range. The tettigoniid community was dominated by Orchelimum fidicinium at low latitudes and Conocephalus spartinae at high latitudes. Several factors might explain this shift, including changes in climate, plant phenology, and plant zonation patterns. O. fidicinium and C. spartinae increased in body size toward low latitudes. In laboratory feeding assays, O. fidicinium readily ate S. alterniflora and J. roemerianus leaves, Orchelimum concinnum, which is largely restricted to the J. roemerianus zone, ate only J. roemerianus leaves, and Conocephalus spp. ate neither, consistent with literature suggestions that they mainly consume seeds and flowers. Geographic variation in species composition and body size of grasshoppers may help explain documented patterns of geographic variation in plant palatability and plant-herbivore interactions in Atlantic Coast salt marshes. Because it can be difficult to identify tettigoniids to species, we present a guide to aid future workers in identifying the tettigoniid species common in these marshes. © 2007 Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.","Bergmann's rule; Biogeography; Latitude; Orthoptera; Plant-herbivore interactions; Salt marsh; Spartina alterniflora","bioassay; body size; community composition; dominance; flower; food consumption; geographical variation; grass; grasshopper; laboratory method; latitudinal gradient; palatability; phenology; plant-herbivore interaction; saltmarsh; seed; Conocephalus; Conocephalus spartinae; Juncus roemerianus; Orchelimum concinnum; Orchelimum fidicinium; Orthoptera; Spartina alterniflora; Tettigoniidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46249098643

International political and economical interests, following the Kyoto Protocol, require estimates of this carbon sequestration. The carbon stock of two rubber tree plantations (Hevea brasiliensis (Willd.) Muell.-Arg.) was assessed in two contrasting climatic areas: western region in Ghana (WG; 2-14-year-old) and Mato Grosso (MG; 14-25-year-old) in Brazil. Trees (76 in WG and 210 in MG) spanning a range of stand ages, clone types and planting layouts were felled and partitioned into log, live lignified branches of selected diameter (large, medium and fine), dead branches, non-lignified fine branches, leaves, taproot and lateral roots. Allometric relationships (log-transformed power functions) based on trunk circumference at a height of 170 cm (C170) were used to predict the tree foliage, aboveground, belowground and total carbon content (kg C tree-1) (r2 = 0.86-0.99). The way in which carbon content varied as a function of C170 depended both on components and sites. Sampling plots (25 in WG and 34 in MG) were established in stands of varying ages, clones and planting layouts, to quantify carbon pools. The tree carbon stocks (t C ha-1) estimated from the allometric relationships for total tree were fitted as a function of stand age using a non-linear sigmoid curve of Gompertz (total tree r2 = 0.841 and 0.854 in WG and MG, respectively). Predicted tree carbon stock for 14-year-old stands was 83% higher in WG (76.3 t C ha-1) than in MG (41.7 t C ha-1), which was partially explained by a difference in tree height growth between the two locations resulting from the contrasting sites. In addition to tree components, the carbon stocks associated with dead wood on the ground, understorey vegetation, litter layer, fine roots (0-60 cm), soil organic carbon (0-60 cm) and charcoal (0-60 cm) were assessed using linear mixed models to evaluate the influence of clone, site, planting layout and age. Only age appeared to have a significant effect for some pools. For 14-year-old stands, the contribution of the soil organic carbon pool (0-60 cm) ranged between 39 and 69% of the total carbon stock, which amounted to 135 and 153 t C ha-1, in WG and MG, respectively. The cumulated contribution of all remaining soil and ground pools (dead wood on the ground, understorey vegetation, litter layer, fine roots and charcoal) was about 5% in both sites. In the framework of the Kyoto Protocol, these results could be useful when drafting a Project Design Document (PDD) for Afforestation and Reforestation Clean Development Mechanism (AR-CDM). © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

B.S.P.]. In 2004 and 2005, we grew black spruce at either 22°C/16°C day/night temperatures [low temperature (LT)] or 30°/24°C [high temperature (HT)] and determined how temperature affected growth, leaf morphology, photosynthesis, respiration and thermotolerance. HT spruce were 20% shorter, 58% lighter, and had a 58% lower root:shoot ratio than LT trees. Mortality was negligible in the LT treatment, but up to 14% of HT seedlings died by the end of the growing season. HT seedlings had a higher photosynthetic temperature optimum, but net photosynthesis at growth temperatures was 19-35% lower in HT than LT trees. HT seedlings had both a lower apparent maximum ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylation capacity (Vcmax) and a lower apparent maximum electron transport rate (Jmax) than LT trees, indicating reduced allocation to photosynthetic components. Consistently, HT needles had 26% lower leaf nitrogen content than LT needles. At each measurement temperature, HT seedlings had 20-25% lower respiration rates than LT trees; however, this did not compensate for reduced photosynthetic rates at growth temperature, leading to a greater ratio of dark respiration to net carbon dioxide assimilation rate in HT trees. HT needles had 16% lower concentrations of soluble sugars than LT needles, but similar starch content. Growth at high temperatures increased the thermotolerance of black spruce. HT trees showed less PSII inhibition than LT seedlings and no increase in electrolyte leakage when briefly exposed to 40-57°C. While trees that develop at high temperatures have enhanced tolerance for brief, extreme heat events, the reduction in root allocation indicates that seedlings will be more susceptible to episodic soil drying and less competitive for belowground resources in future climates of the boreal region. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Boreal forest; Climate change; Elevated temperature; Leaf anatomy","boreal forest; climate change; high temperature; leaf morphology; photosynthesis; respiration; seedling; Picea; Picea mariana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949123047

We find that although food is transported long distances in general (1640 km delivery and 6760 km life-cycle supply chain on average) the GHG emissions associated with food are dominated by the production phase, contributing 83% of the average U.S. household's 8.1 t CO2e/yr footprint for food consumption. Transportation as a whole represents only 11% of life-cycle GHG emissions, and final delivery from producer to retail contributes only 4%.

Foley Public Policy Institute, Department of Public Administration and Policy, Department of Political Science, Washington State University, United States","Too often the debate over climate change is overly simplistic. Given the scale of the problem and the assumption of catastrophic harm, the tendency is to rely on top-down, one-size-fits-all governance solutions, centralized authoritative and coercive governance structures and policies, or a centralized global 'contraction and convergence' carbon trading scheme. These approaches leave little room for robust democratic debate and choice with respect to governance institutions and policies. This article seeks to more fully engage the debate over climate change and governance responses in order to develop a more nuanced, sophisticated understanding, of use to scholars and decision-makers. It does so by employing the two most basic assumptions underlying the climate change and governance debate - the speed of change and the expected severity of climate change effects - as a tool to demonstrate how differing assumptions are likely to affect our understanding of the climate change problem set and thus our preferences and choices concerning governance responses to climate change. Attacking the climate change issue in this way allows us to illuminate key tradeoffs associated with our potential choices and provides us with a far more robust set of governance possibilities than much of the current climate debate allows. Finally, approaching climate change in such a fashion also introduces the possibility that key values associated with democracy (liberty and equity, for example) might have a critical role in building the kind of societal and community resilience to climate change that leads toward long-term environmental sustainability.","Assumptions; Authoritarian; Climate change; Democracy; Governance; Scientific uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-57249086535

The carbon management index (CMI) was shown to be a useful technique for describing soil fertility. Soil samples were collected from natural evergreen broadleaved forest and its artificial regeneration forests of Sassafras tzumu, Cryptomeria fortunei and Metasequoia glyptostroboides in southern Sichuan Province, China, to determine soil carbon fractions, available nutrients, enzyme activity and CMI. Regression analysis was used to determine the relationship between soil carbon fractions, CMI and fertility. The results showed that the contents of soil organic carbon, water-soluble carbon, microbial biomass carbon, labile carbon, non-labile carbon, hydrolysis-N, available-P and available-K, the activity of invertase, phosphatase and catalase, and CMI were ranked with different seasons and followed the order: natural evergreen broadleaved forest > Sassafras tzumu plantation > Metasequoia glyptostroboides plantation > Cryptomeria fortunei plantation. The soil carbon fractions and CMI were significantly positively (P < 0.05) correlated with available nutrients and enzyme activity.

Studies specifically aimed at the relationship between the spatial variation of soil organic carbon and environmental factors are few. In this paper, a typical small watershed named Tongshuang in the black soil region of northeast China, which was subjected to drastic erosion before 1980 and was managed subtly after 1980, was chosen as a study area. Classical statistic and geostatistic analysis methods, in combination with a geographic information system (GIS), were used to quantitatively research the spatial variation characteristics of the soil organic carbon and their relation to the topographic factors and land use. The data on the soil organic carbon, topographic factors, and land use were obtained by soil sampling and measurements derived from DEM, remote sensing images, and field investigations, respectively. The classical statistics analysis results indicated that the variability of the soil organic carbon was moderate (Cv = 0.30). The slope position and land use types were the most discriminating factors. The soil organic carbon content was the highest in the grassland and lowest in the coniferous forest (P &lt; 0.01). It increased gradually along the slope position gradients from the interfluve to the toe slope. The geostatistics analysis showed that the soil organic carbon had a strong spatial correlation. The C0/(C0 + C) was 0.1608, which was mainly induced by structural factors. The mean soil organic content is 2.27% in this watershed. It is on a very low level in the northern black soil of northeast China. In this small watershed of the eroded black soil region, the present soil and water conservation measures play an important role in controlling the soil loss. However, the soil organic carbon's restoration is unsatisfactory. Nearly three-quarters of the land has worrisome productivity. How to improve the soil organic carbon content while targeting the soil fertility is a pressing need. © MAIK Nauka 2008.",,"Land use; Organic carbon; Soils; Topography; Watersheds; carbon cycle; digital elevation model; geostatistics; GIS; land use; land use change; organic carbon; quantitative analysis; remote sensing; soil conservation; soil erosion; soil fertility; soil organic matter; soil property; soil quality; spatial variation; topographic effect; watershed; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40549115723

The temperature-dependent carrier information of holes and electrons as well as the two-dimensional electron gas were identified. The forward conduction can be ascribed to tunnelling-aided carrier emission recombination while the reverse transport can be divided into different mechanisms within different reverse bias ranges. The reverse current can be assigned to minority carrier tunnelling through the space charge region within the backward bias voltage from 0 to about -10 V. With decreasing negative applied voltage from -10 V to around -22 V, the reverse current can be attributed to the tunnelling-assisted Poole-Frenkel emission. With further reduction of the reverse bias voltage from -22 V to about -38 V under 100 K, the reverse current staircases can be allocated to sequential resonant tunnelling; otherwise it can be due to the thermic effect at higher temperature. The main origin of short transient time for the fabricated device can be due to the tunnelling mechanism. © 2008 IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Electric currents; Electron gas; Electronic properties; High temperature effects; Hydrogenation; Nanocrystalline silicon; Carrier emission; Carrier information; Carrier tunnelling; Heterojunctions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42549152963

CAMx generally also reproduced the timing, location, and magnitude of measured surface and 300-m O3 max over Jerusalem, but also showed an even larger concurrent max over western Jordan, an area without observations. Observed near-zero nighttime surface O3 values, however, were over predicted because the CAMx grid was too large to accurately account for local emissions and titration effects.

The IPCC Waste Model has the ability to calculate emissions from a variety of solid waste disposal site types, taking into account country- or region-specific waste composition and climate information, and can be used with a limited amount of data. Countries with detailed data can also run the model with country-specific values. The paper discusses methane emissions from solid waste disposal; explains the differences between the two methodologies in terms of data needs, assumptions, and results; describes solid waste disposal circumstances in Panama; and presents the results of this analysis. It also demonstrates the Waste Model's ability to incorporate landfill gas recovery data and to make projections.

The Waste Model estimates are 26.7 Gg in 1994, ranging from 24.6 Gg in 1990 to 41.6 Gg in 2020. Emissions estimates for Panama produced by the new model were, on average, 8% higher than estimates produced by the former default methodology. The increased estimate can be attributed to the inclusion of all solid waste disposal in Panama (as opposed to only disposal in managed landfills), but the increase was offset somewhat by the different default factors and regional waste values between the 1996 and 2006 IPCC guidelines, and the use of the first-order decay model with a time delay for waste degradation in the IPCC Waste Model.

IMIS is a nationwide comprehensive measuring system which permanently monitors the radioactivity in all important environment media in the whole federal territory. At approximately 40 sites, the activity concentration of radioactive substances is measured in air and precipitations. At least 14 of them are responsible for trace monitoring of radionuclides in the air. The legal bases of IMIS prescribe regular inter-laboratory comparison analyses in cooperation with the Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB), with the use of reference materials prepared by the Federal Coordinating Laboratories. In order to fulfil this requirement in the field of trace survey measurements in ground-level air, the Federal Office for Radiation Protection (""Bundesamt für Strahlenschutz"", BfS) and the PTB have conducted a comparison with real, dust-loaded reference filters in 2005. The comparison was organized within the framework of a cooperation of trace survey stations from Austria, Germany and Switzerland. The paper describes the preparation of the real, dust-loaded reference filters, the procedure for spiking the filters with the activity standard solution containing 22Na, 88Y, 89Sr, 90Sr, 125Sb, 133Ba, 134Cs, and 241Am.

We are developing a C accounting framework that can estimate C dynamics and net emissions associated with changes in land management. One component of this framework integrates field measurements, inventory data, and remote sensing products to estimate changes in soil C and to estimate where these changes are likely to occur at a subcounry (30- by 30-m) resolution. We applied this framework component to a midwestern region of the United States that consists of 679 counties approximately centered around Iowa. We estimated the 1990 baseline soil C to a maximum depth of 3 m for this region to be 4117 Tg. Cumulative soil C accumulation of 70.3 Tg was estimated for this region between 1991 and 2000, of which 33.8 Tg is due to changes in tillage intensity. Without accounting for soil C loss following changes to more intensive tillage practices, our estimate increases to 45.0 Tg C. This difference indicates that on-site permanence of soil C associated with a change to less intensive tillage practices is approximately 75% if no additional economic incentives are provided for soil C sequestration practices. This C accounting framework offers a method to integrate inventory and remote sensing data on an annual basis and to transparently account for alternating annual trends in land management and associated C stocks and fluxes. © Soil Science Society of America.

Disturbance also impacts vegetation productivity and composition dependent on area affected, intensity, and frequency factors. In this study, a new spatially explicit ecosystem model is presented for the purpose of simulating vegetation cover type changes associated with fire disturbance in the northern Chihuahuan Desert region. The model is called the Landscape and Fire Simulator (LAFS) and represents physiological activity of six functional plant types incorporating site climate, fire, and seed dispersal routines for individual grid cells. We applied this model for Big Bend National Park, Texas, by assessing the impact of wildfire on the trajectory of vegetation communities over time. The model was initialized and calibrated based on landcover maps derived from Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper data acquired in 1986 and 1999 coupled with plant biomass measurements collected in the field during 2000. Initial vegetation cover change analysis from satellite data showed shrub encroachment during this time period that was captured in the simulated results. A synthetic 50-year climate record was derived from historical meteorological data to assess system response based on initial landcover conditions. This simulation showed that shrublands increased to the detriment of grass and yucca-ocotillo vegetation cover types indicating an ecosystem-level trajectory for shrub encroachment. Our analysis of simulated fires also showed that fires significantly reduced site biomass components including leaf area, stem, and seed biomass in this semi-arid ecosystem. In contrast to other landscape simulation models, this new model incorporates detailed physiological responses of functional plant types that will allow us to simulated the impact of increased atmospheric CO2 occurring with climate change coupled with fire disturbance. Simulations generated from this model are expected to be the subject of subsequent studies on landscape dynamics with specific regard to prediction of wildlife distributions associated with fire management and climate change.","Big Bend National Park; Climate change; Disturbance; Fire; Modeling; Physiological processes; SEM-LAND model; Semi-arid; Shrub encroachment","Arid regions; Climate change; Ecosystems; Fire protection; Mathematical models; Big Bend National Park; Physiological processes; SEM-LAND model; Shrub encroachment; Vegetation; carbon; climate change; community composition; disturbance; ecosystem modeling; fire; Landsat thematic mapper; landscape; seed dispersal; semiarid region; shrub; vegetation cover; water availability; Big Bend National Park; Chihuahuan Desert; North America; Texas; United States; Fouquieria splendens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43049161140

The model simulates distinct foraging behaviours of Clausocalanus furcatus, Paracalanus aculeatus, and Oithona plumifera. Three sets of simulations were performed to investigate the effects of (a) prey-size preference; (b) variation in prey-size spectra; and (c) turbulence intensity on these species' grazing rates. The size preference simulations demonstrate that, compared with copepodites, mature females have cell ingestion rates that are an order of magnitude lower, while carbon uptake is reduced by 35%. A prey spectrum that is skewed towards cells &lt;6 μm promotes copepodite success because the basal metabolic needs of the adult females require a prey concentration of 850-1000 cells ml-1. Variations in turbulence intensity reveal distinct ecological niches, with stronger mixing favouring O. plumifera and stable conditions favouring C. furcatus. Differences in theoretically derived and simulated prey-encounter rates demonstrate that the hopping behaviour of O. plumifera provides an order of magnitude increase in prey encounter, whereas the feeding behaviour of C. furcatus can result in localized depletion of prey.

Viruses are a pervasive component of microbial food webs in both marine and freshwater systems. The abundance of viruses in individual aquatic systems appears to be independent of salinity but related to the biomass of primary and secondary producers as well as seasonal effects. Burst size, virus production rate and the percentage of microbial cells carrying a viral burden also appear to be more closely correlated to trophic status than to salinity. 2. In marine environments, the roles of planktonic viruses as regulators of carbon and nutrient cycling as well as microbial community structure have been a focus of numerous studies, yet the roles of freshwater virioplankton remain much less studied. Nevertheless, a survey of published freshwater studies demonstrates that virioplankton recycle important quantities of growth-limiting nutrients from hosts via generation of dead particulate and dissolved organic matter during cell lysis, and suggests that both the chemical speciation and concentration of these organic compounds and nutrients may have important influences on the microbial community. 3. Parallel observations on the spatial patterns and dynamics of microbial mortality due to viruses or grazing are more advanced in freshwaters than in marine environments. However, the constraints that determine whether virus- or grazer-mediated mortality dominates are not yet understood in either environment. 4. Application of molecular approaches has facilitated the examination of the diversity and ecological dynamics of specific viral populations and entire communities. The depth of detail achieved in marine environments towards characterizing these populations and communities is just beginning to be matched in freshwater systems. The few available data suggest that viruses targeting-related hosts in freshwater and marine systems may be genetically distinct. 5. Although the role of viruses in aquatic systems is complex and remains insufficiently studied, our survey of the literature indicates that, despite some differences, many of the controls on virioplankton activity and diversity are similar in marine and freshwater environments. © 2008 The Authors.","Bacteriophage; Biogeochemical cycles; Cyanophage; Viral distribution; Viral diversity",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43549097530

The purpose of this report is to investigate this effect by using biological model calculations. Methods and Materials: We compared spread-out Bragg peaks for protons and carbon ions by using physical and biological optimization. The RBE for protons and carbon ions was calculated according to published biological models. These models predict increased RBE values in regions of high linear energy transfer (LET) and an inverse dependency of the RBE on dose. Results: For pure physical optimization, protons yield a better dose distribution along the central axis. In biologically optimized plans, RBE variations for protons were relatively small. For carbon ions, high RBE values were found in the high-LET target region, as well as in the low-dose region outside the target. This means that the LET dependency and dose dependency of the RBE can cancel each other. We show this for radioresistant tissues treated with two opposing beams, for which the predicted carbon RBE within the target volume was lower than outside. Conclusions: For tissue parameters used in this study, the model used does not predict a biologic advantage of carbon ions. More reliable model parameters and clinical trials are necessary to explore the true potential of radiotherapy with carbon ions. © 2008 Elsevier Inc.

Spatial planning represents an important intervention to further European, national and local biodiversity objectives for climate change adaptation. Drawing on case-studies of plans for inland and coastal areas, and involving stakeholder workshops, this paper reports on a trans-national study examining the scope of spatial plans in the Netherlands, England and France in addressing the impact of climate change. It concludes that spatial planning is making provision for biodiversity and dynamic natural processes. However, while good practice in planning for biodiversity under conditions of climate change is developing, systematic use is not being made of available procedures. The paper examines some of the barriers to implementation of this new policy commitment to climate change adaptation. Recommendations are made covering policy development to include climate change impacts upon biodiversity, modified procedures for plan-making and the appraisal of plans and projects.

Health, safety, and environmental risks of these early projects can be managed through modifications of existing regulations in the EU, Australia, Canada, and the U.S. An institutional mechanism, such as the proposed Federal Carbon Sequestration Commission in the U.S., should gather data from these early projects and combine them with factors such as GS industrial organization and climate regime requirements to create an efficient and adaptive regulatory framework suited to large-scale deployment. Mechanisms to structure long-term liability and fund long-term postclosure care must be developed, most likely at the national level, to equitably balance the risks and benefits of this important climate change mitigation technology. We need to do this right. During the initial field experiences, a single major accident, resulting from inadequate regulatory oversight, anywhere in the world, could seriously endanger the future viability of GS. That, in turn, could make it next to impossible to achieve the needed dramatic global reductions in CO2 emissions over the next several decades. We also need to do it quickly.

These techniques differ in their deterioration rates and the investment lags of the corresponding capital stocks. Thus, the paper takes a medium-term perspective on climate change mitigation, where the time horizon is too short for technological change to occur, but long enough for capital stocks to accumulate and deteriorate. It is shown that, in general, only one of the two alternative techniques prevails in the stationary state, although, both techniques might be utilized during the transition phase.

For national sea transport, the new Danish inventory distinguishes between regional ferries, local ferries and other national sea transport. Detailed traffic and technical data lie behind the fleet activity-based fuel consumption and emission calculations for regional ferries. For local ferries and other national sea transport, the new inventory is partly fleet activity based; fuel consumption estimates are calculated for single years, and full fuel consumption coverage is established in a time series by means of appropriate assumptions. For fisheries and international sea transport, the new inventory remains fuel based, using fuel sales data from the Danish Energy Authority (DEA). The new Danish inventory uses specific fuel consumption (sfc) and NOx emission factors as a function of engine type and production year. These factors, which are used directly for regional ferries and, for the remaining navigation categories, are derived by means of appropriate assumptions, serve as a major inventory improvement, necessary for making proper emission trend assessments. International sea transport is the most important fuel consumption and emission source for navigation, and the contributions are large even compared with the overall Danish totals. If the contributions from international sea transport were included in the Danish all-sector totals, the extra contributions in 2005 from fuel consumption (and CO2), NOx and SO2 would be 5%, 34% and 167%, respectively. The 1990-2005 changes in fuel consumption as well as NOx and SO2 emissions for national sea transport (-45, -45, -81), fisheries (-18, 6, -18) and international sea transport (-14, 1, -14) reflect changes in fleet activity/fuel consumption and emission factors. The 2006-2020 emission forecasts demonstrate a need for stricter fuel quality and NOx emission standards for navigation, in order to gain emission improvements in line with those achieved for other mobile sources. The new fuel consumption estimates for national sea transport are regarded as much more accurate than the DEA fuel sales data used previously, and the recommendation for DEA is to replace their current fuel sales figures by the new estimates calculated in this project. Such updated fuel consumption time series for national sea transport will lead, in turn, to changes in the energy statistics for fisheries (gas oil) and industry (heavy fuel oil), so the national energy balance can remain unchanged. For international transport, fuel sales data as such are regarded as highly accurate for Denmark, since they are compiled from audited information from the Danish oil suppliers, and the inventory approach follows good practice for the United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Changes (UNFCCC) and United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) convention, when fleet activity data are missing. However, in order to make inventory upgrades and to support Danish policymakers in bunker emissions allocation, fleet activity-based estimates calculated in a further project would be useful. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A good energy policy for the indoor environment should respond to both the needs of energy conservation and the needs for a desirable indoor healthy environment with a reduction in carbon dioxide (CO2) generation. This study evaluates energy implications and the corresponding CO2 generation of some indoor environmental policies for air-conditioned office buildings in the subtropical climate. In particular, the thermal energy consumption in an air-conditioned office building was evaluated by the heat gains through the building fabric, the transport of outdoor fresh air for ventilation, and the heat generated by the occupant and equipment in the space. With the Monte-Carlo sampling technique and the parameters from the existing office building stocks of Hong Kong, the energy consumption profiles of air-conditioned office buildings in Hong Kong were evaluated. Energy consumption profiles were simulated for certain indoor environmental quality (IEQ) policies on indoor air temperature and CO2 concentration settings in the offices, with other building parameters remaining unchanged. The impact assessment and the regression models described in this study may be useful for evaluation of energy performances of IEQ policies. They will also be useful for the promotion of energy-saving measures in air-conditioned office buildings in Hong Kong.

To enable these proposals, the CPUC has authorized funding for advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) for two investor-owned LDCs. Assuming regulatory approval of the third LDC's application, the state's US$4.28 billion AMI investment will aid new rate designs for 11.3 million electricity customers. Now that California has AMI, what can the state do with it? With AMI in hand, an LDC can implement service options that can further the state's energy initiatives, ranging from resource adequacy requirement (RAR) to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction. These options can efficiently allocate limited capacity based on each customer's willingness to pay, without the unnecessary distinction between price rationing and reliability differentiation. They can be Pareto superior, welfare dominating the default tariffs that apply to these customers. A case in point is the generalized demand subscription service (GDSS) option proposed in this paper. However, it is unclear whether the option will find wide customer acceptance, without an LDC's intensive customer education and marketing efforts. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

The results show the seasonal progression of the ice thickness distribution for six regions around the continent together with statistics on the mean thickness, surface ridging, snow cover, and local variability for each region and season. A simple ridge model is used to calculate the total ice thickness from the observations of level ice and surface topography, to provide a best estimate of the total ice mass, including the ridged component. The long-term mean and standard deviation of total sea ice thickness (including ridges) is reported as 0.87 ± 0.91 m, which is 40% greater than the mean level ice thickness of 0.62 m.

The intelligent agent was first introduced into a micro-traffic flow system. Individual differences in driver behavior were considered, and the theory of probability was applied to reflect the distribution of drivers' stochastic characteristic dispositions. Each vehicle expressed its intelligence through its own character by perceiving the leading vehicle. From an operational perspective, differences in drivers' dispositions were reflected by a weighted coefficient. Finally, a hybrid microcosmic mobile emissions model was proposed. Its coefficients were determined using traffic data and experiments. Because it addresses more aspects of the car-following process, this model is theoretically superior to previous models, as verified by a numerical simulation. The proposed model was applied to a case study of the emissions from ten vehicles in an urban setting. The model effectively estimated mobile emissions rates. The results indicate that the model can reflect individual differences among drivers and demonstrate that reckless drivers generate more emissions. © 2008 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Intelligent agent system; Mobile emissions model; Traffic environment; Traffic flow model","Automobile drivers; Computer simulation; Environmental management; Probability distributions; Traffic control; Traffic surveys; Vehicles; Case studies; Driver behaviors; Individual differences; Intelligent agent system; Leading vehicles; Mobile emissions; Mobile emissions model; Numerical simulations; Stochastic; Traffic datum; Traffic environment; Traffic flow model; Traffic flows; Urban settings; Weighted coefficients; Alternative fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-54949102390

We follow the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change A1B scenario and separate the effects from changes in climate and anthropogenic emissions through sensitivity simulations. The 2000-2050 changes in anthropogenic emissions reduce the U.S. summer daily maximum 8-hour ozone by 2-15 ppb, but climate change causes a 2-5 ppb positive offset over the Midwest and northeastern United States, partly driven by decreased ventilation from convection and frontal passages. Ozone pollution episodes are far more affected by climate change than mean values, with effects exceeding 10 ppb in the Midwest and northeast. We find that ozone air quality in the southeast is insensitive to climate change, reflecting compensating effects from changes in isoprene emission and air pollution meteorology. We define a ""climate change penalty"" as the additional emission controls necessary to meet a given ozone air quality target. We find that a 50% reduction in U.S. NOx emissions is needed in the 2050 climate to reach the same target in the Midwest as a 40% reduction in the 2000 climate. Emission controls reduce the magnitude of this climate change penalty and can even turn it into a climate benefit in some regions.

In this study, the US EPA Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) modeling system is applied to study the contributions of the agriculture-livestock NH3 (AL-NH3) emissions to the concentration of PM2.5 and the uncertainties in the total amount and the temporal variations of NH3 emissions and their impact on the formation of PM2.5 for August and December 2002. The sensitivity simulation results show that AL-NH3 emissions contribute significantly to the concentration of PM2.5, NH4+, and NO3-; their contributions to the concentrations of SO42- are relatively small. The impact of NH3 emissions on PM2.5 formation shows strong spatial and seasonal variations associated with the meteorological conditions and the ambient chemical conditions. Increases in NH3 emissions in August 2002 resulted in &gt;10% increases in the concentrations of NH4+ and NO3-; reductions in NH3 emissions in December 2002 resulted in &gt;20% decreases in their concentrations. The large changes in species concentrations occur downwind of the high NH3 emissions where the ambient environment is NH3-poor or neutral. The adjustments in NH3 emissions improve appreciably the model predictions of NH4+ and NO3- both in August and December, but resulted in negligible improvements in PM2.5 in August and a small improvement in December, indicating that other factors (e.g., inaccuracies in meteorological predictions, emissions of other primary species, aerosol treatments) might be responsible for model biases in PM2.5. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Ecuador has two such decentralised, consolidated experiences: the five-year old Pimampiro municipal watershed-protection scheme and the twelve-year old PROFAFOR carbon-sequestration programme. We describe and compare the two cases, using a common PES definition and methodology, drawing on both primary interview-based information and secondary data. We find that both schemes have been relatively effective in reaching their environmental objectives, in terms of having probably high additionality levels and low leakage effects. A strong focus on the targeted environmental service and a strong degree of conditionality seem to be two key factors explaining these achievements. Although neither scheme has targeted poverty alleviation or other side objectives, both are likely to have improved PES recipients' welfare, mostly through higher incomes. We highlight several observations with more generalised relevance and lessons for the design of PES schemes. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The results demonstrated that Hg(II), Cu(II) and Ag(I) could effectively quench the QD emission based on different action mechanisms: Cu(II) and Ag(I) quenched CdTe QDs because they bound onto particle surface and facilitated non-radiative electron/hole recombination annihilation of QDs; electron transfer process between the capping ligands and Hg(II) was mainly responsible for the remarkable quenching effect of Hg(II). To prevent the approach of metal cations to QD core, the original TGA-capped CdTe QDs were further coated by denatured bovine serum albumin (dBSA). It was found that the dBSA-coated CdTe QDs could be quenched effectively by Hg(II), but Cu(II) and Ag(I) could hardly quench the QDs even at fairly higher concentration levels because the dBSA shell layer effectively prevented the binding of metal cations onto the QD core. On the basis of this fact, a simple, rapid and specific method for Hg(II) determination was proposed. Under optimal conditions, the quenched fluorescence intensity increased linearly with the concentration of Hg(II) ranging from 0.012 × 10-6 to 1.5 × 10-6 mol L-1. The limit of detection for Hg(II) was 4.0 × 10-9 mol L-1. The developed method was successfully applied to the detection of trace Hg(II) in real samples. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

The molecular diagnostic ratios were utilized for the source reconciliation. The aliphatic hydrocarbon and the biomarkers (triterpanes and steranes) distribution show a characteristic of the petrochemical source in the rainwater samples. The PAHs diagnostic ratios [e.g. MP/P, MPI, Fl/(Fl + Py)] indicated vehicular emissions. The fatty acids ratios (e.g. C18:1/C18:0 and C18:2/C18:0) reflect the contribution of cooking emissions, while the higher plant waxes play little part. Moreover, the values of MP/P, MPI, BaA/(BaA + CT) and BeP/(BeP + BaP) reflected the origin of the long-distance transportation to some extent.

Method and Materials: The delivery accuracy of external beam radiation therapy is currently limited by the motion of tumour during treatment. By implanting positron emission fiducial markers into the tumor, and using pairs of position‐sensitive detectors to track the resulting annihilation gamma rays, the position of the tumor can be tracked in real‐time with high accuracy. Positron emission based technique will deliver a lower radiation dose to normal tissue than x‐ray fluoroscopy, and the smaller size of the positron emission markers reduces risk to the patient during implantation. Some previous studies have shown that multiple point markers can be tracked using this technique. In this study, we further extended the technique to track a linear marker. Using a single linear marker has many advantages as compared with multiple point markers: single implantation instead of three can further reduce the patient risk and totally eliminates the possibility of marker migration. An algorithm that iteratively estimates the location and orientation of the linear marker is proposed. The algorithm was then evaluated using data obtained from Monte Carlo simulation. Results: The accuracy of the tracking algorithm improves with increased number of events used. The center of the linear marker was localized to sub‐millimeter accuracy with a total of 1000 events. The end‐points of linear marker were localized with average accuracy of about 2.5 mm, which converts to about 6 degree of uncertainty on the orientation.

Ungulate grazing affects denitrification and the production of N2O. The short-term effect of grazing on denitrification and N2O production has been examined in several grassland ecosystems. However, the effects of long-term grazing have rarely been studied. We measured denitrification and N2O production during the 2005 and 2006 growing seasons in a long-term (17 years) experiment that had five grazing intensities (GI; 0.00, 1.33, 2.67, 4.00 and 5.33 sheep ha-1). We found that denitrification and N2O production rates were seasonally variable during the measurement period, with higher values observed in summer and lower values found in spring and autumn. The grazed treatments resulted in decreased denitrification and N2O production, primarily due to the reduced soil nitrate concentration and organic N content under the long-term grazing. This supported our hypothesis that long-term over-grazing suppresses denitrification and N2O production. Although significant differences in denitrification and N2O production were not found between the four GI, there was a general trend that cumulative denitrification and N2O production decreased as grazing intensity increased, especially in 2006. Lower N losses via denitrification and N2O production in the grazed plots, to some extent, may contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emission and help to preserve soil N and ameliorate the negative impacts of grazing on plant growth, productivity, and ecological restoration processes in the temperate steppe in northern China. © 2008 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Denitrification; Grazing intensity; N2O production; Temperate steppe","denitrification; grassland; grazing pressure; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; nitrous oxide; ozone; pasture; semiarid region; soil nitrogen; steppe; stratosphere; temperate environment; ungulate; Ovis aries; Ungulata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44449099051

As a result, very high Φf values (&gt;0.95) were obtained for BL systems. Bathochromic shifts of λem in the same π conjugation length were largest for BL systems. Thus we succeeded in the creation of highly efficient light emitters in the longer wavelength region by block modification (e.g., Φf = 0.97, λem = 464 nm for BL-9), contrary to expectation from energy gap law. Considerably intense solid emission (Φf ∼ 0.5) in the longer wavelength region (500-560 nm) was also found for BL systems, presumably because of molecular orientation that hinders the self-quenching of fluorescence in solids. From (1) a Lippert-Mataga plot, (2) density functional theory (DFT) and time-dependent DFT (TD-DFT) calculations, and (3) the positive linear relationship between the optical transition energy (vem) and the difference between the highest occupied molecular orbital of the donor and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital of the acceptor (HOMO(D)-LUMO(A) difference), it is elucidated that the excited singlet (Si) state of BL systems has a high charge transfer nature. The number (n) of energetically equivalent dipolar structure (EEDS) units in the oligoarylene ethynylenes is shown to be a measure of the effective n conjugation length in the S1 state. The Si state planarity increases with n values of EEDS units and by the introduction of donor and/or acceptor groups. It is worth noting that the Φf values increase linearly with the n values of EEDS units. © 2008 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemistry; Functional groups; Organic compounds; Acceptor groups; Oligophenylene; Photo-physical properties; Photophysical; Wavelength regions; Physical chemistry; nitrile; poly(phenylene ethynylene); polymer; absorption; article; chemistry; electron; fluorescence; light; quantum theory; X ray crystallography; Absorption; Crystallography, X-Ray; Electrons; Fluorescence; Light; Nitriles; Polymers; Quantum Theory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-46349109639

The comparisons of homologue and congener patterns and multivariate analysis of soil and flue gas samples strongly indicated that most of the soil samples were influenced by the FBIs.

El Niño cycles have synchronized multilake dynamics in lake-water chemistry and in several components of the aquatic biota. Overlain on this cyclic regional pattern, phosphorus, sulphate, and calcium levels have all declined, whereas alkalinity has not yet risen in the most acid-sensitive study lakes, despite large reductions in SO2 emissions. Further, novel and unanticipated stressors have appeared, including nonindigenous predator introductions, Ca decline, salinity increase, and autumn spikes in metals following El Niño induced droughts. The resident biota are clearly responding not only to the familiar historical phosphorus and acid stressors, but also to the interactive effects of changes in multiple stressors in a warming environment. Lakes are best managed with an understanding of dominant limnological trends, their causes, and their responses to past management interventions. The research conducted at the Dorset Environmental Science Centre indicates ""progress but no cigar"" on acid rain, proof of climate variability as a direct and indirect regulator of south-central Shield ecosystems, and the emergence of novel stressors, the effects of which we cannot yet fully predict. © 2008 NRC.",,"aquatic ecosystem; climate cycle; climate variation; El Nino; environmental stress; fishery management; lake water; warming; water chemistry; Canadian Shield; North America",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44149099758

Here we studied whether typical pioneer species (Eriophorum vaginatum, Eriophorum angustifolium and Calluna vulgaris) alter the functional response of the microbial community of a previously cutover peatland. Peat was sampled at three depths (0-5, 20-25 and 40-45 cm) from beneath these species and from bare soil areas. MicroResp analysis using ecologically relevant, radiolabelled, carbon sources showed significant separation in community level physiological profiles (CLPP) of soil microorganisms according to peat depth. This effect was also reflected in microbial biomass carbon, which also decreased with increasing depth. Furthermore, distinct differences in CLPP were observed between the three plant species and the bare soil in the absence of an effect on microbial biomass carbon or total soil carbon. The plant species effects were driven by differential utilisation of xylose, glutamic acid, lysine and phenylethylamine. The data suggest that 'new' carbon inputs from plants colonising abandoned cutover peatland may support communities of microorganisms that have functionally distinct roles in carbon turnover. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

To evaluate the utility of this approach for low-latitude oceanic islands, populations of the modern helicid land snail Theba geminata - a species also abundant in the Quaternary fossil record of the region - were sampled at ten low altitude (&lt; 300 m) sites from coastal areas of the eastern Canary Islands. The results include stable isotopes of (1) 17 aragonite shells of live-collected adult snails; (2) 17 body tissue samples from the same snail individuals; (3) 10 samples of carbonate sediments; (4) 69 plant tissue samples representing all 24 identified species; and (5) 7 rain water samples. The mean isotopic composition of the rain water is - 5‰ (V-SMOW) for δD and - 2‰ (V-SMOW) for δ18O, ranging from - 11‰ to + 2‰ (V-SMOW) and from - 2.6‰ to - 0.7‰ (V-SMOW), respectively. The local vegetation is heterogeneous, including C3, C4, and CAM plants. δ13C values vary from - 13.0‰ to - 29.0‰ (V-PDB) across plant species. Of the 24 species, five are C4, 15 are C3, and four are CAM plants. The δ18O values for shells represent a narrow range of values (from - 0.3‰ to + 2.5‰ [V-PDB]), which is consistent with the low climate seasonality typifying low-latitude oceanic settings. Hypothetical model of the expected δ18O value for shell aragonite precipitated in equilibrium suggests that the most negative δ18Oshell represent the closest estimate for δ18Orain water. The δ13C values of shells range from - 9.4‰ to + 1.7‰ (V-PDB). The most positive δ13C values are attributed to a diet based on C4 plants. The comparison of δ13C values of soft tissues and shells suggests that snails ingested notable amounts (from ~ 20% up to ~ 40%) of foreign carbonates. Consequently, fossil shells with the most negative δ13C values should be selected for radiocarbon dating in future geochronological studies of the region. The δ13C values of body tissues vary from - 12.0‰ to - 27.2‰ (V-PDB), indicating that land snails consumed C3 and C4 plants indiscriminately. The mean carbon isotopic composition, averaged across multiple fossil specimens, may thus provide a useful tool for reconstructing paleoclimates and paleoenvironments throughout the Quaternary history of the Canary Islands and other comparable low-latitude oceanic settings. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

After proton irradiation, near band-edge emission from the CIGS layer was considerably reduced, while deep-level emission emerged at 0.8 eV. Subsequent annealing restored the intensity of the near band-edge emission slightly, and reduced the 0.8 eV band substantially. An anomalous spectral variation caused by the annealing suggests that the 0.8 eV band does not originate from a single irradiation-induced defect. After the irradiation, the 1.35eV emission from the CdS layer was moderately reduced, and the band-edge emission from the ZnO layer had disappeared. These bands recovered to the initial state after the annealing.

In the cocultures, which were grown at 55 °C with a thermophilic butyrate-oxidizing syntroph, the hydrogen isotopic relationship between methane and water was well represented by the following equation:δ DCH4 = 0.725 (± 0.003) · δ DH2 O - 275 (± 3),in which the hydrogen isotope fractionation factor (αH) was 0.725 ± 0.003.

Water-use efficiency (WUE) reflects the coupling relationship to some extent. At stand and ecosystem levels, the variability of WUE results from the trade-off between water loss and C gain in the process of plant photosynthetic C assimilation. • Continuous observations of C, water, and energy fluxes were made at three selected forest sites of ChinaFLUX with eddy covariance systems from 2003 to 2005. WUE at different temporal scales were defined and calculated with different C and water flux components. • Variations in WUE were found among three sites. Average annual WUE was 9.43 mg CO2 g-1 H2O at Changbaishan temperate broad-leaved Korean pine mixed forest, 9.27 mg CO2 g-1 H2O at Qianyanzhou subtropical coniferous plantation, and 6.90 mg CO2 g-1 H2O at Dinghushan subtropical evergreen broad-leaved forest. It was also found that temperate and subtropical forest ecosystems had different relationships between gross primary productivity (GPP) and evapotranspiration (ET). • Variations in WUE indicated the difference in the coupling between C and water cycles. The asynchronous response of GPP and ET to climatic variables determined the coupling and decoupling between C and water cycles for the two regional forest ecosystems. © The Authors (2007).","ChinaFLUX; Evapotranspiration (ET); Forest ecosystem; Gross primary productivity (GPP); North-South Transect of Eastern China (NSTEC); Water-use efficiency (WUE)","carbon; water; biomass allocation; carbon cycle; eddy covariance; energy flux; evapotranspiration; forest ecosystem; mixed forest; primary production; water budget; water use efficiency; article; China; climate; ecosystem; metabolism; physiology; season; tree; Carbon; China; Climate; Ecosystem; Seasons; Trees; Water; Asia; Changbai Mountains; China; Dinghushan; Eurasia; Far East; Guangdong; Jiangxi; Qianyanzhou; Tianchi Volcano; Pinus koraiensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949180248

The results of the statistical analysis at the AIRNOW sites show that the model was able to reproduce the day-to-day and spatial variations of observed PM2.5 and captured a majority (73%) Of PM2.5 observations within a factor of 2, with normalized mean bias of -21%. The consistent underestimations in regional PM2.5 forecast at other networks (IMPROVE and STN) were mainly due to the underestimation of total carbonaceous aerosols at both urban and rural sites. The significant underestimation of the ""other"" category, which predominantly is composed of primary emitted trace elements in the current model configuration, is also one of the reasons leading to the underestimation of PM2.5 at rural sites. The systematic overestimations of SO42- both at the surface sites and aloft, in part, suggest too much SO2 cloud oxidation due to the overestimation of SO2 and H2O2 in the model. The underestimation of NH4+ at the rural sites and aloft may be attributed to the exclusion of some sources of NH3 in the emission inventory. The systematic underestimations of NO3- may result from the general overestimations of SO42-. Note that there are compensating errors among the underestimation of PM2.5 species (such as total carbonaceous aerosols) and overestimation of PM2.5 species (such as SO42-), leading to generally better performance of PM2.5 mass. The systematic underestimation of biogenic isoprene (by ∼30%) and terpene (by a factor of 4) suggests that their biogenic emissions may have been biased low, whereas the consistent overestimations of toluene by the model under the different conditions suggest that its anthropogenic emissions might be too high. The contributions of various physical and chemical processes governing the distribution of PM2.5 during this period are investigated through detailed analysis of model process budgets using the integrated process rate (IPR) analysis along back trajectories at five selected locations in Pennsylvania and Georgia. The results show that the dominant processes for PM2.5 formation and removal vary from the site to site, indicating significant spatial variability.

Bivariate and logistic regression results indicate that CCP-committed localities are quantitatively different to noncommitted localities on both climate-change risk and socioeconomic-capacity dimensions. On vulnerability measures, the odds of CCP-campaign participation increase significantly with the number of people killed and injured by extreme weather events, projected temperature change, and coastal proximity. On socioeconomic-capacity measures, the odds of CCP-campaign involvement increase with the percentage of citizens that vote Democrat and recycle, as well as the number of nonprofit organizations with an environment focus.

Radiative recombination in the ADQW with a wide harrier (9 nm) shows two hands, corresponding to excitons localized in two decoupled QWs with a markedly different spin splitting: small splitting in the NMW due to the positive exciton Landé band g-factor and large splitting in the MW due to the giant Zeeman effect. Contrary, in the ADQW with a narrow barrier (3 nm) an unusual exciton splitting is observed with a negative value of the exciton g-iactor and a strong circular polarization of the exciton bands.

Noise levels were measured in 3 types of buses: (1) bi-articulated, (2) speedy, and (3) feeder, 20 buses of each type. Bi-articulated buses are formed by three cars and two hinges, and operate in exclusive lanes, where cars are not allowed. They stop at specific stations intended for rapid loading and unloading of passengers. Speedy buses operate in regular streets across the city, but they stop at fewer stations than other buses. Feeder buses operate normally in the whole city, along regular streets and bus stops. The evaluation of noise levels in the workplace of bus drivers (that is, inside buses) was performed according to ISO 1999 (Determination of occupational noise exposure), and the brazilian Standards NHO-01 (Occupational Health Standard), and NR 17 (Standard for Ergonomics). In 56 out of the 60 buses examined, the normalized noise exposure levels LEX,8h were below 82 dB(A). The quality of the workplace was thus considered as ""acceptable"". The four buses with measured noise levels above 82 dB(A) demand the adoption of preventive and corrective measures (NHO-01) aiming at reducing noise emission levels. These buses are older and have the engine located in the front. On the other hand, when NR-17 is used as a reference for the evaluation of the noise quality in the workplace of the bus drivers, all buses were considered uncomfortable, with LEX,8h&gt;65 dB(A). Year of manufacture and location of the engine are two factors that highly contribute to the level of noise reaching the driver. These considerations are of relevance, as the placement of the bus engine can be decided at the time of projecting the bus. © 2008.","Bus drivers; Noise; Noise pollution; Occupational health; Occupational noise","Acoustic noise measurement; Ergonomics; Health care; Noise pollution; Occupational risks; Urban planning; Noise levels; Noise quality; Occupational healths; Occupational noises; Bus drivers; article; city; ergonomics; motor vehicle; noise measurement; occupational health; priority journal; traffic noise; urban area; work environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38849097709

Head and neck surgeons will be concerned more frequently with patients presenting symptoms and signs suggesting recurrent tumor or complications of (chemo)radiotherapy. RECENT FINDINGS: Analysis of histologic characteristics and tumor spread of recurrent carcinomas on whole-organ slices of salvage laryngectomy specimens showed that recurrent laryngeal carcinomas are often present with multiple tumor foci dispersed in different regions; furthermore, they may develop beneath an intact mucosa. Only a few articles analyze the reliability of laryngoscopy and biopsy in detecting recurrences after (chemo)radiotherapy: the number of false negative biopsies is relatively high. The differentiation between radionecrosis and tumor recurrence is difficult by computed tomography scan and magnetic resonance imaging in many cases. Positron emission tomography-computed tomography and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging are promising diagnostic modalities to detect or exclude persistent or recurrent disease after (chemo)radiotherapy. SUMMARY: Endoscopy with biopsy, computed tomography scan and conventional magnetic resonance imaging present several deficiencies in diagnosing recurrent disease after (chemo)radiotherapy. New imaging modalities such as positron emission tomography-computed tomography and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging show promising results, increasing the diagnostic efficacy. © 2008 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc.","(Chemo)radiotherapy; Hypopharynx; Larynx; Recurrent carcinoma","fluorodeoxyglucose f 18; cancer grading; cancer radiotherapy; computer assisted tomography; histopathology; human; hypopharynx carcinoma; laryngeal biopsy; larynx carcinoma; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; priority journal; radiation necrosis; review; tumor necrosis; Combined Modality Therapy; Humans; Hypopharyngeal Neoplasms; Laryngeal Neoplasms; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Salvage Therapy",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-40449116072

As part of a national study to quantify N2O emissions under different cropping systems and in different eco-regions, this study quantified the effect of fertilizer N rate on spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) on N2O emissions in 3 yr in a cool maritime climate with humid soil moisture regimes. Treatments were 0, 75 and 150 kg N ha-1 as ammonium nitrate applied as a pre-plant broadcast. N2O emissions were increased by fertilizer N application in each year. In 2003 and 2005, elevated N2O emissions occurred in the 6-wk period following fertilizer application when soil NO3-N concentrations were high. However, in 2004 and 2005, peak N2O emissions occurred near crop harvest. Elevated N2O emissions at this time were attributed to increased carbon availability due to re-wetting of dry soil. Therefore, the effect of fertilizer N management on N2O emissions may not necessarily occur immediately after treatment application. This emphasizes the importance of measuring N2O emissions outside of the crop growth period. Fertilizer-induced cumulative N2O emissions averaged 0.011 and 0.021 kg N kg-1 N when fertilizer N rate was increased from 0 to 75 kg N ha-1 and from 75 to 150 kg N ha-1, respectively, indicating increased N2O emissions when fertilizer is applied at above optimal rates. N2O emissions increased linearly with nitrate intensity, the summation of daily NO3-N concentrations for 0- to 15-cm depth. This suggests that the non-linearity in the relationship between fertilizer N rate and N2O emissions can be explained by the decreasing efficiency in crop NO3-N uptake at high fertilizer N rates.","Carbon availability; Denitrification; Hordeum vulgare; Soil nitrate","barley; biogenic emission; crop production; fertilizer application; nitrous oxide; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-43949142511

A comparison between different regression models was conducted using surveillance data in Adelaide, South Australia. By using notified salmonellosis cases and climatic variables from the Adelaide metropolitan area over the period 1990-2003, four regression methods were examined: standard Poisson regression, autoregressive adjusted Poisson regression, multiple linear regression, and a seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model. Notified salmonellosis cases in 2004 were used to test the forecasting ability of the four models. Parameter estimation, goodness-of-fit and forecasting ability of the four regression models were compared. Temperatures occurring 2 weeks prior to cases were positively associated with cases of salmonellosis. Rainfall was also inversely related to the number of cases. The comparison of the goodness-of-fit and forecasting ability suggest that the SARIMA model is better than the other three regression models. Temperature and rainfall may be used as climatic predictors of salmonellosis cases in regions with climatic characteristics similar to those of Adelaide.

Bioremediation mediated by microorganisms is a highly promising technology that is environmentally friendly, safe, and effective. However, incomplete biological information regarding the cellular responses in many microbial communities restricts progress in the site-specific mineralization process. The application of proteomics in environmental bioremediation research provides a global view of the protein compositions of the microbial cells and offers a promising approach to address the molecular mechanisms of bioremediation. With the combination of proteomics, functional genomics provide an insight into global metabolic and regulatory networks that can enhance the understanding of gene functions. This article deals with the applications of functional genomics and proteomics to dissect the cellular responses to environmental stimuli, such as stress response, induction and expressions of regulatory proteins/enzymes in response to aromatic hydrocarbons and heavy metals. An understanding of the growth conditions governing the expression of the proteome (for example, enzymes and regulatory proteins of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation, energy generation pathways, transport and stress-related proteins) in a specific environment is essential for developing rational strategies for successful bioremediation. © 2008 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

As a result, several forestry-based carbon storage projects have been introduced in many countries. To quantify the dynamics of ecosystem carbon allocation as affected by different forest management practices, we measured the above- and belowground biomass accumulation over 14 years, as well as the tissue carbon concentrations of trees in four different types: three monospecific plantations of slash pine (Pinus elliottii) (SPP), Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) (CFP), and tea-oil camellia (Camellia oleifera) (TCP) and one natural secondary forest (NSF) (Pinus massoniana and Cyclobalanopsis glauca). A regression equation was constructed using the diameter at breast height/basal diameter (DBH/BD) and elements of total tree biomass. The equation was subsequently utilized to estimate tree carbon storage. The carbon storage of understory, forest floor, and soil components was also estimated. Results indicated that NSF stored significantly more carbon (141.99 t/ha) than SPP (104.07 t/ha), CFP (102.95 t/ha), and TCP (113.09 t/ha). Most of the carbon was found in the soil pool (60.30% in SPP, 70.42% in CFP, 63.87% in TCP, and 59.36% in NSF). In addition, more than 60% of the soil carbon storage at 0-100 cm depth was stored in the upper 40 cm. With the exception of trees, each component of NSF, including the understudy, forest floor, and soil, possessed significantly higher carbon storage than that of the three plantations (p < 0.05). Soil surface disturbance during forest management practices was one of the main factors reducing the soil and understory carbon storage of tree plantation stands. These results suggest that natural restoration is a superior approach for increasing the carbon storage potential in the hilly red soil region in reforestation projects compared to plantations. In addition, reducing soil surface disturbance during forest management practices might also play an important factor in improving carbon sequestration potential in above tree plantations. © 2007.","Biomass; Carbon allocation patterns; Carbon storage; Forest restoration; Roots; Soil carbon","Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Reforestation; Soils; Carbon allocation patterns; Carbon storage; Carbon; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate change; concentration (composition); hill; measurement method; phytomass; red soil; reforestation; soil carbon; spatial variation; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystems; Reforestation; Soil; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Camellia; Camellia oleifera; Cunninghamia lanceolata; Pinus elliottii; Pinus massoniana; Quercus glauca",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38949095302

Comparison of the model results with present day observations show that most of the models reproduce the large scale features of the tropical Pacific like the SST gradient, the mean SST and the mean seasonal cycles. All models simulate the ENSO variability, although with different skill. Our analyses show that several relationships between El Niño amplitude and the mean state across the different control simulations are still valid for simulations of the MH and the LGM. Results for the MH show a consistent El Niño amplitude decrease. It can be related to the large scale atmospheric circulation changes. While the Northern Hemisphere receives more insolation during the summer time, the Asian summer monsoon system is strengthened which leads to the enhancement of the Walker circulation.

Quantification of the contribution of this forest restoration program to carbon storage will provide critical information and guidance for designing future forest restoration and management strategies at the provincial level. The Guangdong Provincial Forest Inventory Database, together with our field sampling data was used to estimate carbon storage dynamics over the 10-year period of 1994-2003 for key restoration forest types as well as OBPA (open forest, bamboo forest, production forest and ambient trees). Various layers of forests were considered in calculating carbon storage: tree layers, understory vegetation and litterfall layers for the key forest types and bamboo forests; tree layers and litterfall layers for production forests; and only tree layers for open forest and ambient trees. Our results show that over the 10-year period, the reforestation program has increased total carbon storage by 41.67 Tg and forest carbon density by 1.58 Mg C ha-1. Carbon storage in tree layers was the greatest among all layers studied. Carbon storage in litterfall and understory layers amounted to approximately 38%-44% of the total carbon storage, demonstrating that litterfall and understory layers can not be neglected in estimating regional forest vegetation carbon storage in the sub-tropical forests. It was determined that coniferous forests provided the greatest contribution to total carbon, followed by broadleaved forests, OBPA, and mixed coniferous and broadleaved forests in decreasing order of magnitude. Among all key forest types, stands of P. massoniana had the greatest amount of carbon storage (from 59.65 to 65.87Tg) while Albizia falcataria (Linn.) Fosberg forest stands had the lowest (from 0.05 to 0.37 Tg). Over the 10-year period, carbon storage pools in maturescent forests, mature forests and post-mature forests were on the increasing trend, while those in young forests and middle-aged forests were declining and relatively stable, respectively. Our analysis also shows that the carbon accumulation rate in broadleaved forests (0.19-1.36 Mg ha-1 year-1) was the highest among the key forest types in Guangdong, which has important implications for selection of future forest restoration species. © 2007 Elsevier B.V.

Given photon noise and background and signal variabilities, such experiments show how to optimize an aperture to maximize detectability of the signal. Here, we consider a fundamentally different, more realistic task in which the observer is required to both detect and localize a signal. The signal is embedded in a variable background and is known except for location. We inquire whether the addition of a localization requirement changes conclusions on aperture optimization. We have previously formulated an ideal observer for this joint detection/localization task, and here apply it to the classic problem of determining an optimal pinhole diameter in a planar emission imaging system. We conclude that as search tolerance on localization decreases, the optimal pinhole diameter shrinks from that required by detection alone, and, in addition, task performance becomes more sensitive to fluctuations about the optimal pinhole diameter. As in the case for detection only, the optimal pinhole diameter shrinks as the amount of background variability grows and, in addition, conspicuity limits can be observed. Unlike the case for detection only, our task leads to a finite aperture size in the absence of background variability. For both tasks, the inclusion of background variability yields a finite aperture size. © 2008 Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine.",,"Joints (anatomy); Medical imaging; Optimization; Parameter estimation; Finite aperture size; Joint detection; Planar emission imaging; Photons; aperture diameter; article; clinical observation; collimator; diagnostic imaging; equipment design; human; imaging system; joint radiography; noise reduction; photon; pinhole imaging system; planar emission imaging; priority journal; process optimization; signal detection; signal noise ratio; task performance; technical aid; tissue distribution; Algorithms; Artifacts; Computer Simulation; Diagnostic Imaging; Equipment Design; Humans; Image Interpretation, Computer-Assisted; Models, Statistical; Normal Distribution; Pattern Recognition, Automated; Phantoms, Imaging; Poisson Distribution; Reproducibility of Results; ROC Curve; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42649086001

However, the mechanism responsible for the decreased CYP1A2 remains unknown. Since the transcription factor aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) regulates the expression of CYP1A2 and the disruption of the AhR gene causes liver injuries, we hypothesized that downregulation of AhR plays an important role in the reduced hepatic CYP1A2 during sepsis. Adult male rats were subjected to sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture (CLP). Hepatic tissues were collected at 5, 10, and 20 h after CLP or sham-operation. The gene expression of AhR was assessed by RT-PCR technique. Its protein was determined by Western blot analysis. In addition, subcellular localization of AhR was examined by immunohistochemical staining. The results indicate that hepatic AhR gene expression decreased at 5 h and remained downregulated at 10-20 h after CLP. AhR protein levels were significantly reduced at 10-20 h after CLP. Immunohistochemical examination showed that AhR was mainly located in hepatocyte cytoplasm in sham animals. The translocation of AhR from the cytoplasm to the nucleus was observed in septic animals. The downregulation of hepatic AhR and CYP1A2 observed in septic animals does not appear to be due to the elevated endotoxin levels since administration of polymyxin B (an endotoxin-binding agent) did not affect AhR and CYP1A2 gene expression. However, proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin-1β decreased AhR and CYP1A2 expression. As AhR activates the specific gene expression by binding to the target genes, the translocation of AhR to the nucleus in sepsis would suggest that alterations at AhR binding sites may also contribute to the downregulated CYP1A2 expression in sepsis. Since AhR gene expression decreased earlier than the occurrence of depression of CYP1A2 (CYP1A2 decreased at 10-20 h post CLP), the decreased AhR may play an important role in downregulating hepatic CYP1A2 during the progression of sepsis.","Cecal ligation and puncture; Hepatic cytochrome P-450 isoform 1A2; Hepatoma cells; Interleukin-1β; Liver; Tumor necrosis factor-α","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; cytochrome P450 1A2; interleukin 1beta; liver protein; polymyxin B; tumor necrosis factor alpha; Cyp1a2 protein, rat; cytochrome P450 1A2; endotoxin; interleukin 1beta; polymyxin B; primer DNA; tumor necrosis factor alpha; animal cell; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; binding site; cellular distribution; controlled study; cytoplasm; gene disruption; gene expression; immunohistochemistry; liver cell; male; nonhuman; priority journal; protein binding; protein determination; protein expression; protein function; protein localization; rat; receptor down regulation; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sepsis; Western blotting; active transport; animal; cell line; down regulation; drug antagonism; drug effect; genetics; liver; metabolism; nucleotide sequence; Sprague Dawley rat; Active Transport, Cell Nucleus; Animals; Base Sequence; Cell Line; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2; DNA Primers; Down-Regulation; Endotoxins; Immunohistochemistry; Interleukin-1beta; Liver; Male; Polymyxin B; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Sepsis; Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-44649174954

While there are a number of means by which plant biology intersects with human health (e.g., plant nutrition), one of the most widely recognized is aerobiology; specifically, the ability of plants to both produce pollen and to serve as a substrate for molds/fungi (e.g., sporulation).

An anthropogenic range expansion of cypress has taken place at the northern margin of the range in Italy in recent decades, driven by ornamental planting in spite of climatic constraints imposed by low winter temperature. The expansion has created new habitats for pathogens and pests, which strongly limit tree survival in the historical (core) part of the range. Based on the enemy release hypothesis, we predicted that damage should be lower in the expansion area. By comparing tree and seed cone damage by pathogens and pests in core and expansion areas of Trentino, a district in the southern Alps, we showed that tree damage was significantly higher in the core area. Seed cones of C. sempervirens are intensively colonized by an aggressive and specific pathogen (the canker fungus Seiridium cardinale, Coelomycetes), associated with seed insect vectors Megastigmus wachtli (Hymenoptera Torymidae) and Orsillus maculatus (Heteroptera Lygaeidae). In contrast, we observed lower tree damage in the expansion area, where a non-aggressive fungus (Pestalotiopsis funerea, Coelomycetes) was more frequently associated with the same insect vectors. Our results indicate that both insect species have a great potential to reach the range margin, representing a continuous threat of the arrival of fungal pathogens to trees planted at extreme sites. Global warming may accelerate this process since both insects and fungi profit from increased temperature. In the future, cypress planted at the range margin may then face similar pest and pathogen threats as in the historical range. © 2008 Elsevier Masson SAS.

The CDM allows for a small percentage of emission reduction credits to come from afforestation and reforestation (CDM-AR) projects. We conducted a global analysis of land suitability for CDM-AR carbon 'sink' projects and identified large amounts of land (749 Mha) as biophysically suitable and meeting the CDM-AR eligibility criteria. Forty-six percent of all the suitable areas globally were found in South America and 27% in Sub-Saharan Africa. In Asia, despite the larger land mass, relatively less land was available. In South America and Sub-Saharan Africa the majority of the suitable land was shrubland/grassland or savanna. In Asia the majority of the land was low-intensity agriculture. The sociologic and ecological analyses showed that large amounts of suitable land exhibited relatively low population densities. Many of the most marginal areas were eliminated due to high aridity, which resulted in a generally Gaussian distribution of land productivity classes. If the cap on CDM-AR were raised to compensate for a substantially greater offset of carbon emission through sink projects, this study suggests that it will be increasingly important to consider implications on local to regional food security and local community livelihoods. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

The most important parameter affecting area designated as forest is the minimum crown cover which can be set between 10 and 30%. The choice will have implications for the amount of land available in a country for afforestation and reforestation activities within the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM-AR). In this paper, we present an analysis of the regional differences in land availability for CDM-AR projects. We then examine how the choice of a high or low threshold value for crown cover will affect the area available for CDM activities and how the limitations imposed by this element of the definition compares to other factors that are likely to limit CDM activities. Results represent a global analysis that included all countries not included in Annex I of the Kyoto Protocol, and examined the effect on land availability of a range of crown cover thresholds ranging from 10-30%. Of the 140 Non-Annex One countries, 107 countries were found to have a potential for CDM-AR projects. Asia had the largest amount of combined area suitable for CDM-AR at the 10% crown cover threshold level. However, at 30%, South America had the greatest amount of land available, and a large change in available land area, which increased by almost five times compared to what was available at the 10% threshold. The area available in Africa increased by a factor of 5.5. Central America showed the largest increase, to almost 10 times more at the 30% threshold. By contrast, within Asia, the area increase was comparatively less, but still the area nearly doubled. Globally, a low threshold of 10% crown cover excluded almost 2/3 of the land identified that was eligible at 30%, over 5 million km2. The spatial analyses showed not only the effects of the choice of the crown cover criterion, but also where the land was available for CDM activities within each country at different thresholds. Protected areas account for 10-20% of the CDM-AR eligible area in most countries. © 2007 Springer Science+Business Media, B.V.","Afforestation/Reforestation; Carbon sequestration; CDM-AR; Clean development mechanism; Climate change mitigation; Forest definition; Global spatial analysis; Land suitability modeling; Land use land cover and forestry (LULUCF)","afforestation; clean development mechanism; comparative study; environmental impact assessment; forest cover; reforestation; spatial analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-38649129788

Location: Global. Methods: We collected species richness and diversity data from 86 studies that were conducted around 60 atmospheric point polluters worldwide and reported in 95 papers (published in 1953-2007). We used meta-analysis to search for a general effect and to compare between polluter types and plant groups, and linear regression to describe the latitudinal gradient and to quantify relationships between pollution and effect size. Results: Although the species richness of vascular plants generally decreased with pollution, the effects were not uniform across the studies. Polluters that cause soil acidification imposed a stronger detrimental effect on plant diversity than industries whose emissions increased soil pH. An overall adverse effect was primarily due to the contribution of non-ferrous smelters and aluminium plants; the effects of other SO2-emitting industries were less detrimental, albeit negative, and the effects of chemical plants, fertilizer factories and cement industries did not differ from zero. Longevity of the pollution impact only made a slight contribution to the detected variation, while adverse effects increased with increase in pollution load. Main conclusions: This study is the first demonstration of geographical variation in the responses of plant communities to aerial emissions: adverse effects increased from high to low latitudes, and this pattern was explained primarily by increases in both the diversity of original (undisturbed) communities and mean summer temperatures. The latter result suggests that under a future warmer climate the existing pollution loads may become more harmful. Model calculations indicate that a detectable depauperation of plant communities is unlikely if the polluter emits &lt; 1500 t of SO2 annually. © 2008 The Authors Journal compilation © 2007 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Air pollution; Biodiversity; Climate; Latitudinal gradient; Meta-analysis; Species richness; Vascular plants","atmospheric pollution; geographical distribution; industrial emission; latitudinal gradient; meta-analysis; plant community; pollutant source; pollution effect; species diversity; species richness; vascular plant; Tracheophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42149089343
