Departing from popular accounts that pose China as either an engine of climate catastrophe or as a singular hope for its aversion, I argue that the planetary predicament that climate change raises has been taken up in Chinese politics as a strategic site to reimagine the Chinese Communist Party as a necessary component of the geopolitical and geophysical machinery of continued planetary existence. Rather than gathering difference into the universal scale that the planet has implied in environmentalist discourses, Ong’s work exhorts us to approach the strategic deployment of a Chinese mode of planetarity. © 2020 The Society for Ethnographic Theory.

Injectionof CO2 into geologic formations can cause geomechanical changes and lead to reservoir expansion, groundsurface uplift, and induced seismicity. Such deformations create geomechanical risks associated withGCS, which can compromise the safety and storage capacity of CO2. The geomechanical risks of CO2sequestration have drawn significant attention in recent years due to considerable ground uplifting andinduced microseismic activities that have been reported in several field cases. However, studies in thisarea have not considered the effect of geomechanical risks in optimizing the storage performance. Wepresent an optimization framework to strategically place CO2 injection wells to maximize the storagecapacity and minimize the associated geomechanical risks. To this end, we perform the optimization usingthree-dimensional coupled flow and geomechanical models, by applying the Mohr-Coulomb plastic failurecriterion to model mechanical rock failure risk. Additionally, the geomechanical simulation results are usedto quantify the risk associated with ground surface displacement and plastic strain, which are extracted fromthe simulation outputs. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to maximize CO2 storagewhile minimizing the two forms of geomechanical risks. The injection well locations are defined as decisionvariables and Genetic Algorithm is implemented to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. Thesolution of the proposed framework leads to nontrivial optimal decisions, which are different from thecase where geomechanical risks associated with CO2 injection are ignored. We find that the wells maynot necessarily be concentrated in areas with the highest storage capacity because that may lead to rockfailure and unacceptable levels of ground surface uplift. Instead, the maximum storage is limited to keepthe reservoir in the elastic state based on the specified reservoir geomechanical and flow properties. We alsoobserve that well interactions during CO2 injection can cause shear failure of the formation between thewells. These observations suggest that accounting for geomechanical risks associated with CO2 injection isnecessary to design a sustainable plan for CO2 injection and storage. The paper ends with a discussion aboutthe importance of accounting for the uncertainty in rock properties and the resulting model predictions inoptimizing the well locations. © 2020, Society of Petroleum Engineers.",,"Carbon dioxide; Failure (mechanical); Genetic algorithms; Induced Seismicity; Injection (oil wells); Multiobjective optimization; Rock mechanics; Wells; Geomechanical model; Geomechanical simulations; Injection well locations; Multi-objective optimization problem; Numerical flow simulations; Optimization framework; Trapping efficiencies; Trapping mechanisms; Geomechanics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108370175

They constitute diverse and irreplaceable habitats for a large part of living organisms. Forests also provide invaluable ecosystem services including oxygen production, carbon sequestration, water filtering, climate regulation, protection against avalanches, erosion and desertification. Understanding forest information is the first step in forest protection. So, it is particularly important to know how to measure tree information immediately and accurately. Recent advances in high resolution terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) systems have enabled us to quantify the forest structure in an unprecedented detail. Limiting the adoption of these new lidar-derived methods is the difficulty associated with accessing the information content of point clouds. To retrieve tree-scale metrics from these data, individual tree-level point clouds must be extracted from the larger-area point cloud. It generally involves laborious and time-consuming manual segmentation, especially for large amounts of trees or plots. The more complex the scene is, the more difficult and time-consuming this becomes. Thus, a point cloud segmentation algorithm for individual trees from an amount of point cloud data is proposed in this paper. Initially, generate a digital elevation model (DEM) from ground point cloud. And then normalize point cloud based on DEM. In the following step, create a slice to identify stems, and extract the tree point cloud though RANSAC and region growing. Finally, retrieve the tree-level structural parameters. This method provides reference for tree-level forest inventory based on TLS. © 2020 ACRS 2020 - 41st Asian Conference on Remote Sensing.

Stakeholders involved are increasingly well-informed and expect higher standards of performance to meet wider environmental and social objectives. Sustainability is thus becoming a sound business practice as major business benefits can occur through the application and adaptation of principles based on sustainable processing. Despite much hype and market demand sustainability is still a style with little or no substance. Here, I will provide two commercial examples of sustainable engineering. These real-life examples are based on cutting-edge process intensification innovations at molecular, equipment and process design levels. These examples from design and catalysis will show how to meet environmental & safety goals such as avoiding pollution, minimizing hazardous processing, minimizing waste of raw materials, maximizing process efficiencies, minimizing emissions and efficient use of energy while delivering the economically sound process & plant design. First example, is related to Oil & Gas and is addressing a global and large-scale environmental issue which is not only wasting valuable hydrocarbon resources but is also contributing to global carbon emissions. I have led the development & deployment of novel solutions to address this problem thus not only reducing the emissions but creating value from waste resources. This commercial solution involves designs based on process intensification at all levels. Modular, movable, and compact plant designs of these processes are commercially competitive even at small scale and lower crude price. The second example is related to a petrochemical product and involves commercializing a best in class catalyst and process for a 300-KTA size petrochemical process. Both these examples are geared towards practical aspects of sustainable engineering. I will also explain the business, political, and legal drivers behind the commercialization of these novel sustainable engineering concepts. Furthermore, I will also address the significance of sustainability from the perspective of the Americas, EMEA and APAC regions. I will address how the global air, water, and land resources are threatened with altering climate dynamics and what practical solutions at large-scale could help in short and medium terms. I will also show how some of the innovations described above could contribute not only in growing local economy but may also provide opportunities for implementing sustainability-based solutions in other parts of the world. © 2020 American Institute of Chemical Engineers.

To achieve the Paris Commitment, South Africa needs to reduce its emissions to below 360 MtCO2e by 2030; to below 231 MtCO2e by 2050. In the next two decades (2020-2040), the global community will experience titanic shifts in the energy, transportation, buildings, industry, agricultural and land use sectors of the economy. To track the progress toward the achievement of the national commitments, one would have to measure performance on climate change mitigation and adaptability strategies according to International Standards. The International Standard Organization is yet to pronounce on a specific international standard on carbon emission management. A study is in progress to make a new and original contribution as part contribution to the global body of knowledge in performance management of carbon emissions. The paper presents a SMART performance management system, one that is Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Timely. The idea is to define the SMART key performance indicators that could be incorporated into selected and existing international standards; such that a full case study using South African data; including adaptability and resilience especially in terms of the projected future times, could be developed. © IEOM Society International.","Adaptation; Climate Change; Global Warming; Resilience; SMART Performance Management; Sustainability",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105557308

The palaeoflora of Kassanoi, which is the oldest (Messara Basin, Viannos Fm, Serravallian/early Tortonian), is documented mainly by leaf imprints, including a fern, a conifer (Tetraclinis cf. salicornioides) and 23 angiosperms. The assemblage is dominated by Daphnogene polymorpha, Podocarpium podocarpum and Myrica lignitum. The plant record from Pitsidia (Messara Basin, Ambelouzos Fm, early Tortonian) comprises thousands of specimens. The plant fossils are preserved as imprints often covered by an inorganic encrustation (replica). One alga, 2 ferns, at least 5 conifers and more than 45 woody angiosperms were identified. Dominant taxa are Myrica and Pinus pitsidiensis, documented by numerous vegetative and reproductive organs (Zidianakis et al., 2015, 2016). Leaves of oaks (Q. pseudocastanea, Q. kubinyii) and Daphogene polymorpha as well as twigs of Taxodium dubium are also fairly common. From the palaeoflora of Metochia, which is the youngest (Gavdos Island, Metochia Fm, middle Tortonian), (Mantzouka et al., 2015), we report further taxa, including Quercus mediterranea, Ziziphus paradisiaca and a palm (Sabalites sp.). The vegetation is assessed both empirically (phytosociologically) and by Integrated Plant Record (IPR) Vegetation Analysis. The reconstructed vegetation models are presented in detail and discussed in the context of the geological and palaeontological settings of the area. The climate is assessed based on the Coexistence Approach (CA) and the Climate Leaf Analysis Multivariate Program (CLAMP).

The goal of this project is to streamline the way industry reports air emissions to meet EPA and SLT program requirements. The CAER System (CAERS), an electronic reporting approach, is under development with a completion of the “First Year Pilot.” The CAERS will allow facilities to report to more than one program with a single data submission. To support the CAERS effort, one research project is aimed to identify the differences in data codes between SLT Emissions Inventory (EI) systems and the National Emission Inventory (NEI) system. Two broad categories of differences in codes between SLT and federal programs can exists. One has to do with differences in nomenclature or naming conventions for similar data fields such as a different name or number to represent the same unit type. A second type of difference has to do with codes that are unique for the SLT and are thus, either missing from the NEI code lists or do not have a one to one match with the NEI codes. This presentation will describe the research approach, discuss the project results in identifying both types of differences, and provide recommendations for standardizing codes where possible, identifying necessary crosswalks for codes that cannot be standardized, and identifying missing SLT specific codes so they can be included in the CAER system. Adoption of the recommendations for the CAER system will help minimize the burden for collecting emissions data by facilities and SLTs. © 2020 Air and Waste Management Association.

To cope with the power network problems due to disasters such as grid outages, frequency, and voltage deviation, the network should be incorporated with numerous distributed generations such as solar and wind. During the disaster condition, these distributed fossil generations form Microgrids (MGs) by disconnecting itself from the grid and maintain power flow to the local region. Besides, the negative impacts on the environment, such as carbon emission has reduced by using Renewable Energy Sources (RES). Apart from reducing carbon emission (as in the case of fossil fuel generation plants), RES based microgrid also useful for the resilient distribution system. However, high penetration of distributed generation, for a resilient system that can survive at least its critical loads during extreme disaster conditions, requires robust architecture and communication between the devices of a microgrid. This article presents the latest review of the various classification of microgrid architecture along with the technical characteristics of energy storage devices, various communication channels and discover the gaps to form a bridge between microgrid in normal and abnormal (during a climatic disaster) conditions. In addition, alteration in control techniques for Alternative Current and Direct Current microgrid for robust MGs is presented systematically. Furthermore, the latest developments with sectionalizer placement to provide the steps to achieve near-real-time data and necessary actions required to take during or before the actual disaster are also presented in a systematic manner. © 2020 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc..

In order to clearly express its influence mechanism, the change laws of depth, stress, and permeability of coal seam pressurised by the overlying mountain were studied based on the Winkler elastic foundation beam theory and seepage theory in the paper. At the same time, the enrichment mechanism of the coal seam pressurised by the overlying mountain was analyzed. The results showed the following: (1) There was a significantly strong correlation between the stress, permeability change rule of the coal seam, burial depth, and surface elevation under such condition. (2) Under the action of the vertical pressure of the mountain, the stress and permeability distribution of the coal seam showed significant nonlinear characteristics. The stress was the greatest under the peak, and the permeability was the smallest. (3) The initial gas content value was controlled by the permeability and the stress of the coal seam in the situation. Moreover, the field practice showed that under the action of vertical pressure of the mountain, the evaluation law of gas content was coupling with the surface elevation of the overlying mountain. In addition, the gas emission change law during the excavation of the driving face also showed the same characteristics. The results might be of great significance for the development and utilization of coal-bed gas and the safe exploitation of coal resources. © 2020 Xiaojie Yang et al.",,"Coal; Coal bed methane; Gases; Landforms; Mechanical permeability; Development and utilizations; Influence mechanism; Mountainous regions; Nonlinear characteristics; Permeability change; Permeability distribution; Strong correlation; Winkler elastic foundation; Coal deposits",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102256346

Research on carbon reduction path based on Internet of Things technology is an important direction for global low carbon city research. Carbon dioxide emissions in small cities are usually higher than in large and medium cities. However, due to the large difference of data environment between small cities and large and medium-sized cities, the weak hardware foundation of the Internet of Things and the high input cost, the construction of a small city smart carbon monitoring platform has not yet been carried out. This paper proposes a smart carbon monitoring platform that combines traditional carbon control methods with IoT technology. It can correct existing long-term data by using real-time data acquired by the sensing device. Therefore, the dynamic monitoring and management of low-carbon development in small cities can be realized.

The neighborhoods were selected based on the Local Climate Zone (LCZ) scheme. The meteorological data was obtained from three national meteorological stations located in the suburban areas of Nanjing. The collected data sets were then used as input for building energy simulation. For the ten LCZ sites, the annual mean UHI intensity for the nighttime (19:00-06:00) ranges from 0.3 °C to 2.3 °C, while that for the daytime (07:00-18:00) ranges from 0.3 °C to 1.0 °C. Due to the heat islands in the LCZ sites, for the residential building the cooling demand is increased by 15-25% and the heating demand is reduced by 3-22%, resulting in a range of 2-7% increases in the annual total demand. © Healthy Buildings Asia Conference 2019, HB 2019.

Grasslands are a key component contributing to the productivity of grazing animals but also provide basic food production via livestock grazing for herder survival. Grazing is the most basic means of grassland utilization but is considered one of the more important disturbance factors controllable by humans that has a universal and profound impact on the grassland ecosystem due to animal density and over grazing. For Alpine grasslands, it is not clear what grazing intensity (GI) can be achieved to improve plant biodiversity and vegetative nutritional value while improving sheep productivity. This field experiment was conducted for 7 yr comparing the impact of different GI on vegetation community characteristics, nutritional value, and sheep growth performance on the Alpine meadows of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The GI measured were: Control: 0 sheep/ ha; Low: 3.7 sheep/ha; Medium: 5.3 sheep/ha; and Heavy: 7.6 sheep/ha. The grazing experiment started in 2008, but experimental data collection and analyses were collected for the final 4 yr of 2015 through 2018. All grazing intensities &gt;0 sheep/ ha reduced (P &lt; 0.05) plant height (27%, 46%, and 48%, respectively, for 3.7, 5.3, and 7.6 sheep/ha), ground coverage (16%, 24%, and 48%), and above ground biomass (2%, 42% and 53%) of the various plant communities while increasing (P &lt; 0.05) the grass community density (individuals/m2) compared to a nongrazed Control. With increasing GI, the community height, coverage, and above-ground biomass decreased (P &lt; 0.05), and the plant community density increased then decreased (P &lt; 0.05) compared to Control. As GI increased, the available community biomass nutritional quality increased (P &lt; 0.05). Comprehensive analysis showed that the community density (quantity) and nutritional quality were the highest when the GI was 5.3 sheep/ha. The higher the GI, the greater the grass's nutritive value with lower above-ground net primary production (ANPP). When GI was the highest, the average daily gain (ADG) per hectare was the highest in the short term, but the highest GI endangers the ANPP and profitability of the grassland grazing ecosystem in the long term. Targeting a moderate GI (5.3 sheep/ha) can provide 78% of the ADG per hectare of the highest GI, which meets the requirement of maintaining a sustainable grazing grassland. © The Author(s) 2020.

Therefore, this study aims to assess climatic extremes’ response to the emerging climate change mitigation strategy using a marine cloud brightening (MCB) scheme. Design/methodology/approach: Based on Hadley Centre Global Environmental Model version 2-Earth System model simulations of a MCB scheme, this study used six climatic extreme indices [i.e. the hottest days (TXx), the coolest nights (TNn), the warm spell duration (WSDI), the cold spell duration (CSDI), the consecutive dry days (CDD) and wettest consecutive five days (RX5day)] to analyze spatiotemporal evolution of climate extreme events in the arid Sahara-Sahel-Arabian Peninsula Zone with and without MCB implementation. Findings: Compared with a Representative Concentration Pathways 4.5 scenario, from 2030 to 2059, implementation of MCB is predicted to decrease the mean annual TXx and TNn indices by 0.4–1.7 and 0.3–2.1°C, respectively, for most of the Sahara-Sahel-Arabian Peninsula zone. It would also shorten the mean annual WSDI index by 118–183 days and the mean annual CSDI index by only 1–3 days, especially in the southern Sahara-Sahel-Arabian Peninsula zone. In terms of extreme precipitation, MCB could also decrease the mean annual CDD index by 5–25 days in the whole Sahara and Sahel belt and increase the mean annual RX5day index by approximately 10 mm in the east part of the Sahel belt during 2030–2059.

Increased concentration of greenhouse gases (e.g. methane, carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, etc.) in the atmosphere is considered as the primary cause of global warming which impacts and changes the global climate. Among the greenhouse gases, the effect of carbon dioxide (CO2) on global warming is significantly higher than any other greenhouse gases mainly due to its abundance in the atmosphere. It has been determined by the international global climate organizations that the most effective way to combat climate change is to reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere. Forests as terrestrial ecosystems have an important role in the storage of CO2. In recent decades, the importance of the carbon storage capacity of the forests has been increasing regarding with economic value of carbon storage function. Therefore, the monetary valuation of the carbon stored by the forests has become an extremely important issue. In this study, it was aimed to calculate the carbon storage capacity of a sample forest and estimate its economic value. The study was implemented in Örümcek Forest Enterprise Chief (FEC) located in the city of Gümüşhane in Turkey. The amount of carbon storage was calculated by using the allometric carbon models previously developed for tree species exist in the study area. Then, the economic value of carbon storage was estimated based on the amount of forest products extracted from the FEC between 2005 and 2017, the unit sale prices of the products, and total costs of associated activities over the years. The results indicated that the economic value of carbon stored by the forests was found to be 40.2 TRY per ton. Even though this value cannot be generalized and it is valid specifically for the forest and economic conditions in Örümcek FEC, the results in general highlight the significance of the carbon storage capacity of the forests in terms of their economic assess, which is important for the forestry sector in many countries as well as in Turkey. © Copyright 2020 by Forest Engineering and Technologies Platform on-line at www.http://dergipark.gov.tr/ejfe","Climate change; Ecosystem services; Valuation of carbon storage; Örümcek forest",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100502320

Therefore, our construction industry plays an important role and gives negative impacts on the environment. Factors of embodied energy and carbon emission are important in selecting construction method by considering the low carbon type of construction material to be used during the construction process. This paper presents an analysis of Embodied Energy and carbon emission in a building that used IBS and conventional method to achieve sustainable construction in Malaysia. All data was recorded and analyse using a commercial Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) tool called Carbon Calculator. The study includes IBS component; precast concrete wall panel, column, beam and half slab and cast in situ components; burn clay bricks, reinforced concrete slab, column, and beam. The results are presented in terms of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2E) of construction materials and comparison analysis is made between IBS and Conventional method. The results obtained from Carbon Calculator due to manufacture and installation of components show a that IBS method consumed 26.93 CO2E/m2 and conventional method offers 39.57 CO2E/m2. By comparing IBS and conventional method, it is found that the average of total energy consumption due to construction materials was 33.25 CO2E/m2 and involved 31.94% reduction in comparison with conventional method. Therefore, for further building construction’s practice in relation to type of construction method it is recommended to be below the average amount of energy consumption 33.25 CO2E/m2 (50%) and any values obtained above the average amount is considered not being able to adopt sustainable building practice. Generally, it can be concluded that implementation of IBS method can be regard as a potential in reducing the amount of embodied energy and carbon emission compared to conventional method. © 2020, Construction Research Institute of Malaysia.

Time-averaged CH chemiluminescence imaging is applied to provide information of flame front and heat release. Combustion emission concentrations (CO, UHC, and NOx) are measured by a gas analyzer. Based on Lefebvre’s model, an updated semi-analytical correlation is proposed to predict lean blowout limits of centrally staged combustor considering water addition. Chemical calculation results show that the addition of water leads to lower laminar flame speed and lower adiabatic flame temperature. The lower flame speed and higher flow velocity due to water injection result in higher lean blowout limits. Higher combustor inlet temperature can extend the LBO (lean blowout) limits to lower values at the same water fraction. Flame observations indicate that during the flame blowout process with the decrease of fuel flow rate, the post flame region first extinguished, and then upstream to the flame root. Flame close to the lean blowout presents a V shape and stabilizes in the recirculation zone near the nozzle. The heat release decreases with the increasing water injection. Emission results show that the water injection can reduce NOx emissions due to the thermal effects of flame temperature, while the CO, UHC emission increase on the contrary. The semi-analytical correlation to predict LBO limits shows fair agreement with experiments values at different water fractions. The prediction error compared to experiment data is within -11.3 % to + 12.8 % in the present centrally staged combustor configuration.

Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAV) technology is considered to be an effective way to relieve these problems. It is believed that buses, trucks, and other special vehicles could be among of the first application areas to promote the development of CAV technology. Because of their features of high emissions of pollutants and high energy consumption, the improvement of environmental benefits for such heavy vehicles as buses is the focus in this research. Therefore, this paper aims to evaluate the impact of automated buses on emissions and energy consumption on urban expressways. To achieve the research objectives in this paper, the established automated buses model is embedded into the simulation platform with VISSIM dynamic link library. Models are developed for emissions and energy consumption calculations based on vehicle-specific power to quantify the environmental impact of automated buses. Two improvement strategies: dedicated managed lane and dedicated bus lane, are designed. Finally, a VISSIM simulation platform based on the Fourth Ring Road in Beijing (Xueyuan Bridge to Haidian Bridge) is built to conduct case studies. The results show that CAV technology in buses can reduce exhaust emissions and save energy. Moreover, the managed lane strategy brings a significant reduction in the emissions and energy consumption of automated buses. These findings can be used for the development of automated bus operational strategies focused on environmental benefits. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2020.",,"Automation; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Simulation platform; Dynamic link library; Environmental benefits; High energy consumption; Improvement strategies; Operational strategies; Research objectives; Urban expressway; Vehicle specific power; Buses",Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099459738

Tropical cities are significantly impacted by temperature increases, higher than average global rising sea levels, and extreme weather events. In the tropical Asia-­Pacific region effects from the El Niño-­Southern Oscillation are especially severe, which, in turn, cause disasters such as floods and droughts. Climate change requires cooperation from actors across geopolitical borders to respond to the problem collectively, which involves global networks in the exchange of climate mitigation policies and adaptation plans through a process of policy transfer. This paper examines the processes of policy transfer between the tropical coastal city of Semarang in Indonesia and its global networks in the ‘ 100 Resilient Cities ’, and the ‘ Water as Leverage ’ programs.

Ten responses in three categories are found to be commonly considered in each of the four application areas. The three categories are energy or greenhouse gas reduction, integrated modelling and planning, and improving social benefits. The main drivers of these responses may vary with the application area.

Considering the possible two-way feedback among the three, based on the panel data of 30 regions in China from 2000 to 2017, this paper establishes a spatial Durbin model including economic growth, energy consumption equation, and CO2 emissions and studies the dynamic relationship and spatial spillover among economic growth, energy consumption, and CO2 emissions effects. The results show that the economic growth can significantly improve carbon dioxide emissions, and China's economic growth level has become a positive driving force for carbon dioxide emissions. However, economic growth will not be significantly affected by the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. There is a two-way relationship between energy consumption (ENC) and carbon dioxide emissions (CO2). Energy consumption and carbon emissions are interrelated, which has a negative spatial spillover effect on the carbon dioxide emissions of the surrounding provinces and cities.

Therefore it is necessary to describe the trends of future climate change with more concise conclusions. Climatic analogs are an effective method used to measure the similarity between two climate scenarios. By mapping a given climate scenario to another familiar climate scenario and measuring their similarity complex climate prediction models can be simplified and made easier to understand. In this study we used climatic analogs of 378 cities in China and the suitable future climate area of China to study climatic novelty in China. The results show that (1) climatic novelty in the North China Plain Xinjiang Tibet and parts of southern China is relatively high and these areas may experience more drastic climate changes than other areas; (2) most cities have climatic analogs to the south hundreds of kilometers away indicating that the climates of these cities may change significantly; and (3) China's suitable climate area will change significantly in the future and these changes are closely related to whether effective emission reduction measures are taken.

These attribute primarily to the physical properties of steam as having high heat capacity to reduce local flame temperature, and hence reduce emissions by inhibiting the thermal NOx forward reaction rate. In this work, ultra-high steam content with a steam-to-air mass ratio of up to 40% is premixed with methane-air mixture before entering into a swirl-stabilized HP-burner for combustion. A significant change of flame from V-shape (attached) to M shape (detached) is observed through a transparent combustion chamber whilst changing steam content. The measurement of chemiluminescence OH* is conducted with an intensified CCD-camera band-pass filtered at 320nm. Following these measurements, large eddy simulation is used to capture reacting flow features. Reasonably well agreements between experimental data and numerical results are obtained for both attached and detached flames in terms of the OH* distribution. Slight inconsistency of OH* intensity is mainly due to uncollected wall temperature which leads to either over- or under-prediction of chemical reaction rate depending on the experimental flame positions. Distributed flame front is clearly identified with LES for wet methane combustion associated with 35% steam-to-air ratio corresponding to a high Karlovitz number flame. Slightly unstable combustion is observed when the steam-to-air ratio exceeds 40% featuring an onset of flame blow-off. In addition, interaction between precessing vortex core and the flame is presented for different level of steam dilution, and conclusions are drawn regarding the flame stabilization. The in-depth understanding of the ultra-wet combustion is an important step towards the use of sustainable, steam-diluted bio-syngas for electricity production.

It is imperative to establish a flexible carbon quota allocation system based on the unbalanced characteristics of resource endowment and economic development in different regions. Unlike previous distribution research, this paper considers five principles, which are fairness principle, efficiency principle, feasibility principle, development principle, and innovation principle. The maximum deviation method is used to research the carbon emission quota allocation in 30 provinces of China, and the results are compared with those under the single principle and the information entropy method. The results reveal that the distribution under the single principle is severely unbalanced, making the region have a strong sense of relative deprivation. The maximum deviation method is better than the information entropy method to achieve carbon intensity by 2030. It is also conducive to promote the coordinated development of the regional economy, narrow the poverty gap, and achieve sustainable development.

However, through effective traffic management, it has been found that the level of pollution can be significantly reduced, facilitating the mobility of urban arterials. This study aims to quantify the extent of traffic emissions and to identify the influence of traffic management to improve air quality and reducing traffic emissions. An Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) model was developed to estimate the extent of traffic emissions (N02 and PM10) at certain intersections. Then, a traffic management simulation software was also used to simulate traffic and to build a traffic improvement scenario at these intersections. This was followed by measuring the improvement in air quality due to traffic management modification, analysed using the developed ANFIS model. The results showed that reducing the delay at certain intersections may reduce N02 and PM10 significantly. The proposed hybrid model increased the forecasting accuracy and improved the perception between the relationship between traffic characteristics and pollutant emissions. Additionally, it facilitates the work of city planners and helps decision making regarding urban air quality.

Following a stratified-cluster sampling approach, a total of 1,775 visitors (69.7% response rate) completed online or paper surveys at 20 pre-selected Missouri state parks and historic sites. Results indicated that visitors living within 100 miles of these locations were more willing to engage in climate friendly behavior, but less supportive of climate friendly management actions, as compared to those living farther away.

This paper proposed an integrated method, the LSTM-STIRPAT, to predict the CO2 emissions in 30 provinces, and assess the drivers of a different region. We divide 30 provinces according to the prediction result into provinces with peak value(PWP) and provinces without peak value(PWTP) and found that (i) Inner Mongolia, Jiangxi, Shandong, Hainan, Chongqing, Guizhou, Qinghai, Xinjiang are failed to reach their CO2 emissions peak by 2030, but almost all provinces experienced a small peak in their carbon emissions from 2008 to 2013; (ii) The ranking of CO2 emissions influencing factors in the PWTP is energy intensity (+) &gt; population density (+) &gt; energy consumption (+) &gt; urbanization rate (−) &gt; GDP per capita (+) &gt; ratio of secondary industry (+); the ranking of CO2 emissions influencing factors in the PWP is energy intensity (+) &gt; ratio of secondary industry (+) &gt; urbanization rate (−) &gt; population density (+) &gt; energy consumption (+) &gt; GDP per capita (−); (iii) PWTP's CO2 emissions show a significant lag effect, of which the ratio of secondary industry accounts for the most significant impact. According to the research results, we put forward relevant targeted measures to achieve China's carbon emissions peak commitments in 2030: (1) PWTP should give priority to encouraging the development of technology and strengthening the utilization of new energy and renewable energy; (2) PWP should give priority to reducing energy intensity, optimizing the industrial structure and accelerating the process of urbanization; (3) CO2 emission reduction in PWTP is a long-term task, it is necessary to adhere to the optimization and adjustment of the industrial structure. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","CO2 emissions drivers; CO2 emissions prediction; LSTM; STIRPAT model","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Energy policy; Industrial research; Long short-term memory; Population distribution; Population dynamics; Population statistics; Carbon emissions; CO2 emission reduction; Energy intensity; Industrial structures; Integrated method; Population densities; Renewable energies; Research results; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097447947

However, the quantitative effects of such a measure are still relatively unknown in traffic management. In this paper, we firstly established an optimal allocation model of shared parking spaces, which is a pure integer linear programming model of maximizing the number of served public vehicles to avoid cruising for parking. Further, the parking space allocation model was expanded to an estimation model that quantifies the effect of emission reduction. Secondly, a branch-and-cut algorithm was introduced as the core algorithm to solve the proposed models. Finally, detailed sensitivity analysis, based on empirical data collected by electronic parking toll collections and questionnaire surveys in Beijing, China, evaluated the proposed model and algorithm. The results indicate that shared parking can both effectively reduce the cruising time and the number of vehicles, but also has significantly a positive effect on emission reduction. This research is helpful to provide theoretical support for alleviating parking pressure and environmental problems.

Traditional data assimilation or fusion methods are mainly focused on individual pollutants and thus cannot support simultaneous assimilation for both PM2.5 and O3 . To fill the gap, this study proposed a novel multipollutant assimilation method by using an emission-concentration response model (noted as RSM-assimilation). The new method was successfully applied to assimilate precursors for PM2.5 and O3 in the 28 cities of the North China Plain (NCP). By adjusting emissions of five pollutants (i.e., NOx, sulfur dioxide = SO2, ammonia = NH3, VOC, and primary PM2.5) in the 28 cities through RSM-assimilation, the RMSEs (root mean square errors) of O3 and PM2.5 were reduced by about 35% and 58% from the original simulations. The RSM-assimilation results in small sensitivity to the number of observation sites due to the use of prior knowledge of the spatial distribution of emissions; however, the ability to assimilate concentrations at the edge of the control region is limited. The emission ratios of five pollutants were simultaneously adjusted during the RSM-assimilation, indicating that the emission inventory may underestimate NO2 in January, April, and October, and SO2 in April, but overestimate NH3 in April, and VOC in January and October. Primary PM2.5 emissions were also significantly underestimated, particularly in April (dust season in NCP).

However, such growth also led to increases in energy consumption and carbon emissions. From 2005 to 2011, the growth rate of logistics carbon emissions in the B-T-H was maintained at 8%–10%. Subsequently, owing to policies and technological progress related to energy saving and emission reduction, a positive decrease in carbon emissions was observed. The statistical research revealed that the absolute difference in the logistics carbon emission level in B-T-H fluctuated greatly, the level of logistics carbon emissions was unbalanced. Use of the logarithmic mean Divisia index decomposition method revealed that the industrial scale and population scale were promoting factors of logistics carbon emissions in B-T-H, whereas energy intensity was the main inhibiting factor. The effect of the energy structure was not significant. Differences in the influencing factors of the three B-T-H areas were observed. Some suggestions are proposed: The population of B-T-H should be strictly controlled, energy intensity should be reduced, the energy structure and traffic structure should be adjusted, and a cooperation mechanism should be established. © 2020 Gheorghe Asachi Technical University of Iasi, Romania.

Humanity's concern for nature may be affected by their ability to combine reality with the simulated effects of human impact on the environment. An urgent task today is creating software applications to assess the impact of human activities on the environment. Recently, most scientists have been trying to model the impact of various factors on environmental change today and for decades using information technology. Visual models are very impressive and they also make a deep impression on the psychological state of the person. This forces people to use natural resources wisely. In this article we have considered the sequential process of building and implementing models for assessing the impact of pollutants from a stationary emission source. We have created a software product that helps to show visually how the emissions of a chemical plant are spreading to the surrounding city. The harmfulness to the city of the cloud into which emissions are converted can also be calculated by the program.

Venter et al. 2006. Bioscience, 56(11): 903–910). Because of rapid environmental change in Canada and an enhanced understanding of the drivers of species endangerment, we updated the 2005 analysis and tested for changes in threats up until the end of 2018. We also expanded the scope to acknowledge climate change as a seventh major threat to species, given its increasing importance for reshaping biological communities. Using information on the COSEWIC (Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada) website, we scored the threats for each of 814 species. Habitat loss remained the most important anthropogenic threat to Canada’s at-risk species, affecting 82% of species, followed by over-exploitation (47%), introduced species (46%), and pollution (35%). Climate change was the least important threat, affecting only 13% of species. However, report writers used less certain language when talking about climate change compared with other threats, so when we included cases where climate change was listed as a probable or future cause, climate change was the fourth most important anthropogenic threat, affecting some 38% of species. The prevalence of threat categories was broadly similar to those for the United States and IUCN listed species. The taxa most affected by climate change included lichens (77%), birds (63%), marine mammals (60%), and Arctic species of all taxa (79%), whereas vascular plants (23%), marine fishes (24%), arthropods (27%), and non-Arctic species (35%) were least affected. A paired analysis of the 188 species with two or more reports indicated that any mention of climate change as a threat increased from 12% to 50% in 10 years. Other anthropogenic threats that have increased significantly over time in the paired analysis included introduced species, over-exploitation, and pollution. Our analysis suggests that threats are changing rapidly over time, emphasizing the need to monitor future trends of all threats, including climate change. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

Even though Australia only takes 0.33% of the population in the world, its per capita carbon emission level is the biggest of the world, the Australian construction sector also accounts for a great part in economic development and carbon emissions. As there are extensive and complicated connections in industrial sectors, it is necessary to investigate the carbon emission linkages among the Australian construction sector and other sectors. Based on the data from the world input-output database (WIOD) during 1995 to 2009, this research aimed to quantify the CO2 emission linkages associated with the Australian construction sector by combing the hybrid multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model and hypothesis extraction method. As the net backward CO2 emission was much higher than the net forward CO2 emission, indicating the Australian construction sector was a final demand sector. From the inter-regional level, the construction sector in Australia had continual international trade with China, ROW, and Japan. For the inter-sectoral perspective, the construction sector imported most CO2 emissions from S17 (electricity, gas, and water supply), S11 (other non-metallic mineral), and S12 (basic metals and fabricated metal) and exported the biggest flows to S31 (public admin and defence; compulsory social security), and S29 (real estate activities). By using the results, the study tries to give some countermeasures for the construction sector in Australian, which is used to promote energy productivity, develop industrial structure promotion, and update the policy direction for CO2 emission reduction. © 2020 American Society of Civil Engineers.",,"Carbon dioxide; Construction industry; Emission control; Gas emissions; Global warming; International trade; Water supply; Carbon dioxide emissions; CO2 emission reduction; Construction sectors; Energy productivity; Extraction method; Industrial structures; Input output model; Nonmetallic minerals; Mineral industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096782313

The phenotypes of infiltrating macrophage may impact CaOx-mediated kidney inflammatory injury as well as crystal deposition. How aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) regulates inflammation and macrophage polarization is well understood; however, how it modulates CaOx nephrocalcinosis remains unclear. Methods: Mice were intraperitoneally injected with glyoxylate to establish CaOx nephrocalcinosis model with or without the treatment of AhR activator 6-formylindolo(3,2-b)carbazole (FICZ). Positron emission tomography computed tomography (PET-CT) imaging, Periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining, and polarized light optical microscopy were used to evaluate kidney injury and crystal deposition in mice kidney. Western blotting, immunofluorescence, chromatin immunoprecipitation, microRNA-fluorescence in situ hybridization, and luciferase reporter assays were applied to analyze polarization state and regulation mechanism of macrophage. Results: AhR expression was significantly upregulated and negatively correlated with interferon-regulatory factor 1 (IRF1) and hypoxia inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1α) levels in a murine CaOx nephrocalcinosis model following administration of FICZ. Moreover, AhR activation suppressed IRF1 and HIF-1α levels and decreased M1 macrophage polarization in vitro. In terms of the mechanism, bioinformatics analysis and chromatin immunoprecipitation assay confirmed that AhR could bind to miR-142a promoter to transcriptionally activate miR-142a. In addition, luciferase reporter assays validated that miR-142a inhibited IRF1 and HIF-1α expression by directly targeting their 3'-untranslated regions. Conclusions: Our results indicated that AhR activation could diminish M1 macrophage polarization and promote M2 macrophage polarization to suppress CaOx nephrocalcinosis via the AhR-miR-142a-IRF1/ HIF-1α pathway. © The author(s).

However, the relevant literature has only tackled the carbon mitigation of a single transport mode in a specific region. Under China’s road-to-rail policy, this article investigates the total transport cost, carbon and nitrogen emissions of the imported iron ore transport chain between Brazil and the steel enterprises in the Bohai Economic Rim (BER), and established a model to select the optimal transport plan. Inspired by the policies calling for capacity structure reform of steel industry and energy structure adjustment of highway transport, the authors set up 12 scenarios and estimate the cost and emissions. The results demonstrate the positive economic and environmental impacts of the road-to-rail policy, the development of multimodal transport of railway and waterway (MTRW), and the capacity structure adjustment of the steel industry. However, the impacts of capacity structure adjustment might be marginalized. Besides, natural gas trucks are proved important to fulfilling the goal of clean highway transport. Finally, the discussion on the recent policy of liquidation mechanism reform reveals that the unit railway transport cost should be reduced moderately. Otherwise, the reduction cannot save total transport cost, but cause greater carbon and nitrogen emissions. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","emissions; energy structure; freight transport structure; Iron ore transport chain; multimodal transport; road-to-rail policy","Carbon; Cost benefit analysis; Cost reduction; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Iron ores; Motor transportation; Ore analysis; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Rails; Roads and streets; Steelmaking; Transportation routes; Carbon and nitrogen; Carbon mitigation; Empirical analysis; Energy structure adjustments; Imported iron ores; Multimodal transport; Optimal transport; Structure adjustments; Industrial economics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096131438

Environmental conditions in subsurface (ca. 250–75 m) and near-surface to surface water (75–0 m) were studied on the basis of the distribution patterns and fluxes of planktic foraminiferal faunas. Stable isotopes in three different species were measured, and Mg/Ca-and transfer function-based sea-surface temperatures were calculated. The mean shell weights of planktic foraminiferal species were used to assess changes in calcium carbonate preservation. Modern total planktic foraminiferal distribution patterns from plankton tows and the water column carbonate chemistry were investigated for comparison with the palaeo-data. The results show warm sea-surface conditions and moderate to high surface productivity at ca. 21–400 AD, ca. 900–1400 AD and from about 1850 AD until present, which may be local expressions of the European climatic events known as the Roman Warm Period, the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Recent Warming.

However, an emission inventory of semi-volatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds (S/IVOCs), the key precursor of SOA, particularly the gridded inventory that is appropriate for input into regional air quality models, remains limited in China, leading to an incomplete understanding of S/IVOCs sources and roles in SOA formation and the atmospheric environment. Therefore, a gridded emission inventory of S/IVOCs in China for 2016 was developed based on ample source-specific measured data on emission ratios of S/IVOCs to primary organic aerosols (POA) from literatures. The total emission of S/IVOCs was estimated to be 9.6 Tg, and industry and residential sectors were major sources of S/IVOCs, with contributions of 48.0% and 30.2%, respectively. The spatial variations suggested that S/IVOC emissions were mainly distributed in the highly industrialized and urbanized regions in China, such as Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), the Pearl River Delta (PRD), and the Sichuan–Chongqing (SC) regions, though the contributions and temporal patterns varied between different regions. Furthermore, uncertainty of the emission inventory was estimated to be within the range of −66%–153%, which was mainly attributed to emission ratios of IVOCs/POA for industry, transportation, and power plants. The gridded emission inventory developed in this study can be used to estimate the emissions of S/IVOCs in different regions, and can be applied to different models for a better understanding of the environmental effects of S/IVOCs. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","China; Semi-volatile and intermediate volatility organic compounds; Uncertainties; Updated emission inventory","Aerosols; Air quality; Climate change; Organic compounds; Atmospheric environment; Emission inventories; Oxidative capacity; Regional air quality models; Residential sectors; Secondary organic aerosols; Spatial variations; Yangtze river delta; Uncertainty analysis",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095885720

Regional Climate Models (RCMs) are major physical functioning tools to downscale and simulate future climate projections under various scenarios. However, most RCMs’ products present of uncertainties and generate systematic and random biases. A need of post-processing, bias correction, is inevitable to produce a dependability RCM’s products. It is obvious that bias correction performance is location dependent. In this study, a widely used Quantile Mapping (QM) technique is applied over upper Ping River basin to correct daily rainfall from MM5-RCM. Different distributions between transformation of QM are tested. Mixed distribution between Bernoulli-Weibull, Bernoulli-Gamma and non-parametric transformation are performed. The derived transformation with mixed distributions are included Bernoulli distribution in order to consider the probability of number of rain and no-rain days. Rather than predetermined distribution function, non-parametric transformation might also yield a likely better estimation due to it freedom of fitting distribution. Overall, bias correction methods are generally improved and reduce climate model output bias which is needed to be done before quantifying any impacts of climate change study. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Bias Correction; Climate Model; Daily Rainfall; Quantile Mapping; Upper Ping River Basin","Climate change; Distribution functions; Mapping; Rain; Soil moisture; Water resources; Watersheds; Weibull distribution; Bernoulli distributions; Bias-correction methods; Different distributions; Future climate projections; Location dependents; Mixed distribution; Physical functioning; Regional climate models; Climate models",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095852269

The environmentally friendly and favorable thermophysical properties of R290 and the high efficiency of rotary compressors have led to the proposal of R290 rotary compressors for use in split-room air conditioners in hot climate regions. The performance of R290 rotary compressor at high temperatures requires in-depth research. In this study, an R290 rotary compressor was experimentally and numerically studied at different ambient temperatures (ta = 35 °C, 46 °C, and 55 °C), using different oils (mineral oil and synthetic oil). The results show that the volumetric efficiency (η v) and adiabatic efficiency (η ad) of the R290 rotary compressor decrease by only 5% and 6%, respectively, from ta = 35 °C to 55 °C; even at 55 °C, η v and η ad are 89% and 67%, respectively, while the decrements of the R32 rotary compressor both reached more than 10%. In addition, the R290 rotary compressor performance differs with different oils because of miscibility, solubility, and viscosity influences on leakage and friction losses. © Copyright © 2020 ASHRAE.",,"Air conditioning; Domestic appliances; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Solubility; Temperature; Adiabatic efficiency; Experimental and numerical analysis; High temperature; High-efficiency; Room air conditioners; Rotary compressors; Viscosity influence; Volumetric efficiency; Gas compressors",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095821007

Injection of CO2 into geologic formations can cause geomechanical changes and lead to reservoir expansion, ground surface uplift, and induced seismicity. Such deformations create geomechanical risks associated with GCS, which can compromise the safety and storage capacity of CO2. The geomechanical risks of CO2 sequestration have drawn significant attention in recent years due to considerable ground uplifting and induced microseismic activities that have been reported in several field cases. However, studies in this area have not considered the effect of geomechanical risks in optimizing the storage performance. We present an optimization framework to strategically place CO2 injection wells to maximize the storage capacity and minimize the associated geomechanical risks. To this end, we perform the optimization using three-dimensional coupled flow and geomechanical models, by applying the Mohr-Coulomb plastic failure criterion to model mechanical rock failure risk. Additionally, the geomechanical simulation results are used to quantify the risk associated with ground surface displacement and plastic strain, which are extracted from the simulation outputs. A multi-objective optimization problem is formulated to maximize CO2 storage while minimizing the two forms of geomechanical risks. The injection well locations are defined as decision variables and Genetic Algorithm is implemented to solve the multi-objective optimization problem. The solution of the proposed framework leads to nontrivial optimal decisions, which are different from the case where geomechanical risks associated with CO2 injection are ignored. We find that the wells may not necessarily be concentrated in areas with the highest storage capacity because that may lead to rock failure and unacceptable levels of ground surface uplift. Instead, the maximum storage is limited to keep the reservoir in the elastic state based on the specified reservoir geomechanical and flow properties. We also observe that well interactions during CO2 injection can cause shear failure of the formation between the wells.

This can be achieved by pumping the formation water or gas injection. In this study, the Baode region is selected to study the drainage conditions and production characteristics on the early stage of CBM production. The temporal trends of water production, wellhead pressure and gas production have been analysed. Results show that the favourable burial depth for CBM accumulation between 500 and 700 m. Sandy mudstone and mudstone are beneficial to CBM preservation. The wellhead pressure should be maintained between 0.4 MPa and 1.0 MPa, and the optimal range of wellhead pressure lies between 0.5 and 0.8 MPa for stable production. The gas production increases with increased water production when the wellhead pressure has become progressively stable in the middle phase of early stage.

From the perspective of bounded rationality, this paper comprehensively considers the impact of traveler's personal attributes and behavioral characteristics on parking reservations. The data processing analysis shows that the traveler's age, gender, monthly income, and other characteristics have a certain impact on the parking reservation choice behavior. Reservation price is the key factor affecting the parking reservation policy. Travelers show different value perceptions of the reserved price of parking spaces, and this process has been verified to be roughly the same as the prospect theoretical model. As the reference point for highest reservation price becomes larger, travelers tend to choose to pay less than the ideal reservation price and become more sensitive to losses. It can be found from the model functions and survey data that the ideal reserved parking space price in the survey area is 5 yuan per hour which equals the normal parking fee, and the ideal parking reservation time is less than 2 hours. The research results provide a basis for formulating reasonable parking reservation schemes and parking policies. © 2020 Yunqiang Xue et al.",,"Surveys; Behavioral characteristics; Bounded rationality; Parking reservations; Personal attributes; Reference points; Reservation price; Theoretical modeling; Value perceptions; Data handling",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094893621

To answer this, based on the spatial Durbin model, this study empirically examines the impact of regional corruption on carbon emission, using panel data from 30 provinces in China during the period 2002–2017. The results show that: (1) there is an indistinctive N-shaped relationship between regional corruption and carbon emissions at the national level. Regional corruption tends to initially aggravate carbon emissions, then contributes to emission reduction, and then finally boosts carbon emissions. However, this effect is not statistically significant. The results suggest that the role of regional corruption on carbon emissions is twofold. Corruption can exacerbate and can also inhibit regional carbon emissions. (2) Pronounced regional heterogeneity exists with regard to the influence of corruption on carbon emissions. Regional corruption and carbon emissions show a significant N-shaped dynamic relationship in China’s central region, while the relationship is not significant in the eastern and western regions. (3) The impact of regional corruption on carbon emissions varies with time. For 2002–2009, regional corruption did not have a significant effect on carbon emissions. For 2010–2017, the direct effect became significant, and an apparent N-shaped relationship formed between regional corruption and carbon emissions. Based on the empirical results, this paper proposes several policy recommendations regarding corruption and carbon governance.

A large collection of maps populated with graphs of Monte-Carlo simulation results support a communication device in this regard-a convenient visual that we hope will make comparative results tractable and credible and resource allocation decisions more transparent. Since responding to climate change is a risk-management problem, it is important to note that these results address both sides of the risk calculation. They characterize likelihood distributions along four alternative emissions futures (thereby reflecting the mitigation side context); and they characterize consequences along these transient trajectories (which can thereby inform planning for the iterative adaptation side). Looking across the abundance of sectors that are potentially vulnerable to some of the manifestations of climate change, the maps therefore hold the potential of providing comparative information about the magnitude, timing, and regional location of relative risks. This is exactly the information that planners who work to protect property and public welfare by allocating scarce resources across competing venues need to have at their disposal-information about relative vulnerabilities across time and space and contingent on future emissions and future mitigation. It is also the type of information that integrated assessment researchers need to calibrate and update their modeling efforts-scholars who are exemplified by Professor Nordhaus who created and exercised the Dynamic Integrated Climate-Economy and Regional Integrated Climate-Economy models. © 2020 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Climate change; damages; distributions; mitigation; region; sector; temperature; uncertainty; United States",,Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093533616

A study on the rules of fluid transfer and reliability of CO2 storage during gas injection is necessary for the engineering application. However, the clarification of multifield coupling in long-term CO2 sequestration is the difficulty to solve the aforementioned problem. Previous investigations on the coupled model for CO2 storage in coal seam were not exactly comprehensive; for example, the multiphase flow in the fracture and the nonlinear behavior of gas diffusion were generally neglected. In this paper, a new multistage pore model of the coal matrix and the corresponding dynamic diffusion model were adopted. Meanwhile, the CO2-induced coal softening and the CO2-water two-phase flow in coal fracture were also taken into account. Subsequently, all the mentioned mechanisms and interactions were embedded into the coupled hydromechanical model, and this new fully coupled model was well verified by a set of experimental data. Additionally, through the model application for long-term CO2 sequestration, we found that the stored CO2 molecules are mainly in an adsorbed state at the early injection stage, while with the continuous injection of gas, the stored CO2 molecules are mainly in a free state. Finally, the roles of multiphase flow and gas dynamic diffusion on fluid transfer and coal behavior were analyzed. The results showed that the impact of multiphase flow is principally embodied in the area adjacent to the injection well and the coal seam with lower initial water saturation is more reliable for CO2 sequestration, while the impact of gas dynamic diffusion is principally embodied in the area far away from the injection well, and it is safer for CO2 sequestration in coal seam with greater attenuation coefficient of CO2 diffusion. © 2020 Rui Yang et al.",,"carbon sequestration; coal seam; diffusion; fluid injection; hydromechanics; multiphase flow; saturation",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092919210

How to make an energy-efficient scheduling solution when renewable and non-renewable energy drive the production alternatively is of great importance. In this paper, a multi-objective flexible flow shop batch scheduling problem with renewable energy (MFBSP-RE) is studied, variable processing time and handling time are taken into account. To begin with, the mathematical model is formulated to minimise the carbon emission and makespan simultaneously. Then, a hybrid non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm-II (HNSGA-II) with variable local search is proposed to solve the MFBSP-RE. The operation-based encoding method is employed. A low-carbon scheduling algorithm is presented. Besides the crossover and mutation, a variable local search is employed to improve the Pareto set. Finally, the results of experiments show that the proposed HNSGA-II outperforms the standard NSGA-II algorithm and can solve the MFBSP-RE effectively and efficiently.

However, spatial variability in N2O fluxes complicates the determination of key factors of N2O fluxes at different scales. Based on an updated database of N2O fluxes and the main edaphic factors of global forests, the magnitude of N2O fluxes from forests and the relationships between edaphic factors and N2O fluxes at different scales were analyzed. According to the results, the average annual N2O flux of the global forest was 142.91 ± 14.1 mg N m−2 year−1 . The range of total forest estimated N2O emission was 4.45–4.69 Tg N in 2000. N2O fluxes from forests with different leaf traits (broadleaved and coniferous) have significant differences in magnitude, whereas the leaf habit (evergreen and deciduous) was an important characteristic reflecting different patterns of N2O seasonal variations. The main factors affecting N2O fluxes on the global scale were ammonium (NH4+) and nitrate (NO3−) concentrations. With an increasing scale (from the site scale to the regional scale to the global scale), the explanatory power of the five edaphic factors to N2O flux decreased gradually. In addition, the response curves of N2O flux to edaphic factors were diversified among different scales. At both the global and regional scales, soil hydrothermal condition (water filled pore space (WFPS) and soil temperature) might not be the main spatial regulation for N2O fluxes, whereas soil nutrient factors (particularly NO3− concentration) could contribute more on N2O flux spatial variations. The results of site-control analysis demonstrated that there were high spatial heterogeneity of the main N2O controls, showing N2O fluxes from low latitude forests being more likely associated with soil WFPS and temperature. Thus, our findings provide valuable insights into the regulatory edaphic factors underlying the variability in N2O emissions, when modeling at different scales. © 2020 by the authors.

Recent advances in technology for solar cells and photovoltaic (PV) modules have resulted in solar power being a cost-effective fuel reduction alternative for this objective. This paper is intended to provide a hybrid solar diesel power system for short-run ferries. This work proposes and emphasizes the energy efficiency, cost efficiency and minimal environmental impact of hybrid-powered ferries with solar diesel. The proposed system has been studied on the example of passenger-car ferry connecting the two banks of the Suez Canal at Port Said city-Egypt. Economic and environmental analyses have been conducted to determine and measure the advantages of the proposed system. The results show an economically viable and environmentally sustainable system if it were treated as a long-term investment. Compared to the equivalent diesel generator system, this system reduces exhaust emissions by about 375 tonnes per year.

The treatment of municipal solid waste (MSW) using MBT is a hot topic in environmental geotechnical engineering. Permeability tests were carried out on MBT waste using a compression and permeability combined apparatus and a large-scale vertical permeability apparatus taking the influence of particle size into consideration. The permeability of samples with smaller particle sizes was found to be lower for the same pressure and dry mass (%) of component. The best-fit line between the logarithmic permeability and variables such as the dry density was linear. As the dry density increased or the void ratio decreased, the permeability of samples with smaller particles decreased more. The logarithmic permeability increased with the increase in the average particle size and void ratio. The permeabilities of MBT waste corresponding to particle size ranges of 0-10, 0-20, and 0-40 mm were 10-10-10-5, 10-8-10-4, and 10-5-10-3 m/s, respectively.

Using the super slackbased measure approach, which considers carbon emissions and three kinds of industrial waste as undesirable outputs, this study examines the eco-efficiency of 48 cities in the Bohai Rim from year 2005 to 2015. Ecoefficiency exhibites a pattern of polarized disparity, with observable increase regional difference. Nonlinear timevarying factor and dynamic panel models are used to analyze the evolution and convergence of eco-efficiency. Analysis of club convergence revealed that the Bohai Rim area is divided into five groups by values and yearly changes of eco-efficiency. The analysis revealed that two groups show strong eco-efficiency and obvious growth paths, while the eco-efficiencies for the other three groups are weak, with stagnant growth paths. The results confirm the existence of relative β convergence through ordinary least squares and generalized methods of moments, and suggest that economic growth, foreign direct investment and fiscal decentralization have positive influences on eco-efficiency, while the development of secondary industry has negative effects on ecoefficiency. © 2020, AIDIC Servizi S.r.l.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092069758

It is shown that new approaches to establishing permissible emissions are an important step towards taking into account human health indicators while limiting the negative impact of all types of emission sources. The main positive innovations are the consideration of long-term pollution indicators, verification of calculated data by field measurements and the use of risk assessment methodology when choosing priority substances. A comparative analysis of the results of emissions despersion simulating and instrumental data (at the environmental monitoring observation points) showed the need to adjust the consolidated databases of emission sources in the territories of the federal ""Clean Air"" project. A conceptual scheme is proposed for establishing limits for permissible emissions from the standpoint of ensuring the sanitary and epidemiological well-being of the population. It is proposed to supplement the normatively fixed algorithm with a number of steps that will ensure not only compliance with established hygienic standards for air quality, but also take into account the consequences of multicomponent pollution specific to each city. Such steps include identifying unacceptable risk zones in the territories, assessing the contribution of each business entities to health risks and assessing the residual risk after the implementation of separate environmental protection measures and the totality of comprehensive plans measures. The authors indicate that achieving acceptable risk should be supported by epidemiological data on the territory and the results of in-depth biomedical research.

Such a situation is typical for many cities in the country; primarily, for those that are included into ""Pure air"" Federal project, a part of the ""Ecology"" National project. Negative effects are produced by a set of various substances emitted from various industries. And it is quite often that great numbers of people are exposed to such emissions and as a result multiple and variable responses from their health are registered. Assessment of share contributions made by different emissions sources and each particular substance into aggregated negative responses from human health is a fundamental stage in assessing damages to health that occurred due to them; it is significant for working out an action plan aimed at hazardous impacts mitigation. Given that, we proposed an approach based on fuzzy sets theory as a relevant methodological basis for assessing efficiency of risk mitigation and damage to health when planning and implementing activities aimed at ambient air protection. Application of this methodology allows assessing conditions of multi-component negative impacts producing multiple negative effects including direct damage done to human health. And here key parameters are assessed not as per point values but as per interval ones that are characterized with their belonging to a range of scaled parameters. Our research goal was to suggest methodical approaches to assessing efficiency of risk mitigation and damage to health when planning and implementing activities aimed at ambient air protection; the approaches were based on fuzzy sets theory. Results obtained via hygienic (field or calculated examinations of ambient air quality in settlements under exposure and beyond it) and epidemiologic (controlled medical and biological) research are taken as initial data for fuzzy modeling of multiple parameters ratios within ""damage to health - mitigation efficiency"" system. Principles applied for research design take into account key postulates of exposure assessment, ""dose - effect"" relationship for an influencing substance, a concept of exposure risk acceptability, peculiarities related to body reactions under combined aerogenic burdens, and plans for ambient air protection activities (including complex ones). Comparing a list of substances that do actual damage to exposed population's health with a list of substances included into plans on aggregated emissions reduction allows assessing adequacy; determining to what extent damage to health is mitigated allows assessing whether activities aimed at ambient air protection are sufficient and effective. © Zaitseva N.V., Zemlyanova M.A., May I.V., Alekseev V.B, Trusov P.V., Khrushcheva E.V., Savochkina A.A., 2020.","Adequacy; Adverse effects; Ambient air contamination; Ambient air protection; Damage to health; Effectiveness; Exposed population; Fuzzy sets theory; Mitigation; Sufficiency",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092017216

The coal samples under linear loading are on the initial damage state, and slight fatigue, moderate fatigue, deep fatigue, and ultimate fatigue failure under cyclic loading. The acoustic emission shows the ""L-""type development evolution law in any previous stress level range, while at the last stress level, it shows the obvious ""U-""type development evolution law. The higher the frequency of the cyclic loading is, the higher the rate of initiation and expansion of the microcrack will be, while the more obvious acoustic emission phenomenon will appear. Furthermore, the ringing counting rate is basically the same as that of the energy counting rate. Under triaxial cyclic loading, a shear failure mode that extends along different directions of fracture surface will be presented. The acoustic emission in the range of different stress levels shows a different degree of Felicity effect. In contrast, it is more reasonable to use the principal stress difference as a parameter to study the Felicity effect of coal under cyclic loading. © 2020 Yongjie Yang and Luyi Xing.",,"Coal; Cyclic loads; Damage detection; Failure (mechanical); Fatigue damage; Rock mechanics; Stress analysis; Acoustic emission characteristics; Acoustic emission detection; Acoustic emission signal; Electrohydraulic servos; Experimental research; Internal relationships; Rock mechanics tests; Shear failure mode; Acoustic emission testing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092001667

Among various amines, polyethyleneiemine (PEI) is likely to be the most effective and promising candidate. However, previous studies have mainly focused on examining various supports to increase PEI loading and then enhance CO2 adsorption capacity. In this study, one rare earth element (Ce) and 6 first-row transition metals (from V to Cu) in the oxidation states impregnated on PEI incorporated γ-Al2O3 were prepared and investigated as potential catalyst/promotor for base-catalyzed reaction. Thermodynamic analysis, including isothermal and quasi-static CO2 adsorption tests, were implemented to evaluate the performances amongst the 7 metal oxides. The results showed that MnO2, CeO2 and Fe2O3 showed a better performance in isothermal CO2 adsorption at 75oC. Upon quasi-static tests, the results also indicates that the peak adsorption temperatures (Tpeak, a) of V2O5 and Cr2O3 shifted to high temperature region, whilst opposite behavior of MnO2 was observed. In preliminary study, density functional theory (DFT) was also adopted to assist the screening of metal oxide in terms of bond length and adsorption energies. © 2020 Trans Tech Publications Ltd, Switzerland.","Carbon capture; Metal oxides; Polyethyleneimine; Thermodynamic analysis","Adsorption; Alumina; Aluminum oxide; Amines; Bond length; Carbon dioxide; Cerium oxide; Density functional theory; Hematite; Isotherms; Manganese oxide; Rare earths; Thermoanalysis; Transition metals; Vanadium pentoxide; Adsorption energies; Adsorption temperature; Base-catalyzed reaction; First row transition metals; Polyethyleneimine; Post-combustion carbon captures; Quasi-static tests; Thermo dynamic analysis; Chromium compounds",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090804799

Biodiesel demandis the crucial factor in the design of SCN, but is quite uncertain, so a stochastic approach that considers uncertain scenarios was developed, and its recommendations were compared to those of a deterministic model. Three different scenario-generation methodologies were applied to illustrate the applicability of the approach. The proposed model determines (1) the numbers, locations, and sizes of a carbon capture and storage system; (2) the numbers, locations, sizes, and types of bio-refineries; (3) the transportation paths of CO2 and water from feedstock fields to bio-refineries; and (4) the transportation paths of biodiesel from bio-refinery to demand cities, while minimizing the expected total cost considering several constraints, e.g., locations of power plants as carbon sources, potential locations of bio-refineries, and demands for biodiesel at each site. The proposed model was validated by applying it to a case study based on the predicted biodiesel demand of Korea in the year 2030. A numerical example illustrates that the unit production cost of alga-derived biodiesel by the stochastic model (US$ 2.8/L) is at least 5% more economical than that of the deterministic model (US$ 2.99/L). The proposed approach was able to respond to uncertain demand situations in SCN design.","Biodiesel; Microalgae; Optimization; Supply Chain Network; Two-stage Stochastic; Uncertainty",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090432869

The newly available land provides fresh but immature habitat for colonisation by land plants: combined with the influence of climatic warming and changes in patterns of water availability, some have undergone a rapid increase in abundance and changes in the utilisation of life history strategies. The changes in climate have more subtle effects on terrestrial animals and, while responses to or consequences of individual elements of climate change can be identified at species or individual level, as yet few attempts have been made to synthesise these across either communities or multiple environmental variables. In addition to consequences attributable to environmental change, Antarctic ecosystems now also face the direct impacts of human presence, in the form of increasing incidence of introduction and establishment of non-indigenous (“alien”) species. Direct (introduction) and indirect (via environmental change) consequences of human action will act synergistically to further impact native ecosystems, through a combination of lowering the barriers to successful colonisation and establishment and increasing the frequency and diversity of biota introduced to the region. To date, most marine and oceanic habitats have shown only equivocal evidence of warming, but there has been a marked decrease in sea ice extent in the region west of the Antarctic Peninsula, most recently linked with evidence of rapid warming at near-surface (< 100 m) depths. Antarctic Peninsula regional warming, decreasing sea ice extent, and some biological parameters, are linked through global teleconnection to ENSO events. Contemporary marine environmental changes, while small in absolute terms, are likely to be sufficient to influence the population dynamics of many marine organisms, and also approach the tight ecophysiological stress tolerance limits of some, as strong stenothermy is often a feature of their biology. Southern Ocean marine ecosystems have, however, already been heavily and possibly irreparably impacted by the direct effects of human economic activity. © 2020 World Agriculture.","Antarctica; Colonisation; Cross-disciplinary; Ecosystem; Environmental change; Human impact; Non-indigenous species; Synthetic approach; Trophic interactions",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090218090

To the surprise of the stakeholders, this industry dramatically ebbed in 2019. The dockless bike-sharing system deviated from a problem-solver to a troublemaker in a very short period. The oversupplied and excessively discarded shared bikes caused a big waste of resources and serious pollution to the environment. In this paper, the decision-making of the key players of the industry, i.e. business operators, investors, customers and government, is analyzed through the lens of the cognitive bias. This paper aims to illuminate the process of how this innovative transport solution turned to a disastrous ending, which caused damage to urban environment and financial loss to investors. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, a qualitative analysis based on the rich secondary data sources is conducted. A rich amount of qualitative data including news reports, government policies, consulting reports and companies’ annual reports etc. were collected. Findings: The study shows, in the product introduction period, the government, business operators, investors and consumers fell into the cognitive bias. They over focused on the positive side such as high-tech, eco-friendly, convenient image of the dockless bike-sharing solution. Thereby, the key stakeholders made irrational decisions in product adoption and management. This study moves toward increasing key stakeholders’ awareness of the imperative to reduce these biases when promoting eco-innovations. This study also recommends a prudent attitude with a rational and comprehensive thinking style in dealing with eco-innovation and the emerging sharing economy.

The soil microbial activities and characteristics were determined to further explore the effect mechanism on SR. Two treatments based on incorporating straw were used to improve reclaimed soil in Chongming Dongtan, China. Treatment 1 involved direct incorporation of straw into the soil through tilling, while in Treatment 2, the straw was first composted and then incorporated into the soil through tilling. The results show that after the SOC remediation with Treatment 1, there was an increase of 9.3% while Treatment 2 caused an increase of 9.4% compared with the control. Plant biomass with Treatments 1 and 2 was 3.44 and 1.67 times that of the control, respectively, which indicates a higher carbon input capacity, although soil respiration only increased by 23.5 and 46.4%, respectively. Microbial biomass and β-glucosidase activity was also higher at the treated sites compared to the control with a tendency of Treatment 2 > Treatment 1 > the control. The microbial community structure at the Treatment 2 site was different than Treatment 1 and the control site. These findings imply that the microbial activities with Treatment 2 were greater than those with Treatment 1, which means a higher rate of carbon metabolism, resulting in increased SR in Treatment 2. Both treatments decreased the soil salinity and bulk density and modified the soil physical structure thereby increasing the plant biomass. Moreover, Treatment 1 with a higher SOC input (plant biomass) and lower SR presented higher carbon sequestration potential. Composted straw incorporation biasing to soil microbial activities and changing the community structure might be an important cause of increased soil respiration in Treatment 2 compared to Treatment 1 (direct incorporation of the straw) and the control. © 2020 Friends Science Publishers.","Microbial activities; Plant biomass; Soil organic carbon; Soil respiration; Straw returning mode",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090081740

A secondary air sleeve was installed outside the combustion head of the burner, and spiral blades were arranged in the sleeve to improve the flame combustion state of the burner. The accuracy of the numerical study was verified by comparing with the existing experimental results. The orthogonal test method, single factor analysis method and response surface method were used to study the influence of secondary air parameters (screw pitch, number of spiral blades, and primary air coefficient) on NOx emission. Results of single factor analysis shows that NOx emissions decrease with the decrease of screw pitch and primary air coefficient. Results of multivariate analysis shows that screw pitch and primary air coefficient had significant influence on NOx emission. The influence order of three factors on NOx emission is: screw pitch &gt; primary air coefficient &gt; number of spiral blades. The optimization results show that NOx emission is 18.95 ppm under the optimum conditions of screw pitch of 300 mm, number of spiral blades of 8, and primary air coefficient of 0.7.

This study quantifies and characterizes the ambient levels and spatial distribution of VOCs in urban and rural areas of Balikesir city, Turkey. For these assessments, passive sampling of VOCs performed at approximately 50 locations in and around the city of Balikesir. Twenty-five VOCs were regularly monitored and analyzed with the GC-FID system. The sampling periods were carried out for seven-day periods during March and August 2010. In the study, mean ΣVOC concentrations were found to be as high 67 and 51 μg m-3 for the winter and summer seasons, respectively. Median concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m, p-xylene and o-xylene were 2.6, 11, 1.30, 1.80 and 0.73 μg m-3, respectively. Although there were some changes between concentrations of VOC groups between the summer and winter campaigns, differences were not dramatic. Winter-to-summer ratios of the target compounds ranged from 0.2 (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene) to 9 (hexane). Most of the target compounds have higher concentrations in winter. Only few VOCs, including n-propylbenzene, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene, 1-undecene and 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene have higher concentrations in summer. Spatial distribution of VOCs demonstrated that the roads are hot spots for measured VOC concentrations. The drinking water treatment plant, industrial solvent emissions from pesticide and insecticide applications in agriculture, and emissions from traffic were the sources that contribute to total VOC load in the Balikesir atmosphere. © 2020 Universidad Nacional Autonoma de Mexico.","PMF; Source apportionment; Urban atmosphere; VOCs","ambient air; atmospheric pollution; BTEX; concentration (composition); pollutant source; seasonal variation; spatial distribution; volatile organic compound; Balikesir [Turkey]; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088823569

The process of implementing Directive 2008/50/EU in Ukrainian legislation, the requirements for monitoring various pollutants in the air (particulate matter (PM2.5, PM10), CO, SO2, NO2, O3) and the measures that Ukraine must take to implementation of the Directive are considered. The approaches to monitoring air pollution in Ukraine, the features of the Ukrainian air quality index—air pollution index are considered. The state of air pollution in different cities of Ukraine is analyzed, the most polluted cities and regions are determined in accordance with the air pollution index. Statistical studies on emissions into the air by stationary and mobile sources of pollution in Ukraine in 1990–2018 are carried out. In particular, the following pollutants were considered: SO2, NO2, CO, CO2, PAHs, Zn, Pb, Cu, Cr, Ni, Ar. It has been established that 5 cities in Ukraine generate emissions, which make up 40.2% of all emissions in the country. The main enterprises polluting the air in the largest cities are given. The process of measuring air pollutant concentrations as part of an air pollution monitoring system is considered. The optimal number of posts required for the implementation of the Directive has been determined. The features of monitoring air pollution in Kyiv are considered. The above-mentioned shortcomings of the air pollution monitoring system are shown and ways to eliminate them are proposed.

We use the coding technique of content analysis to capture quantitative data of carbon reduction and classify sample firms by disclosure content into three groups and then apply ordinal logit regression to test the proposed hypotheses. Firm size (Size) and profitability (Profit) are positively related to carbon disclosure; SOE blockholder (State-bloc) and high carbon emission industries (HCEI) are significantly more dedicated to carbon disclosure. However, POE blockholder (Private-bloc) and creditors (Lev) are negatively related to carbon disclosure. We also find that the effects of HCEI and Ownership differ most widely between firms in coastal areas and firms in non-coastal areas; State-bloc is more significantly related to carbon disclosure in the 12th-five period than in the 11th-five period. Chinese firms should understand that taking substantive actions of carbon disclosure, fulfilling social responsibilities, and aligning their operations to the planned economy can contribute to their sustainable development. This paper offers evidence of variations in drivers of carbon disclosure, and such variations are attributable to the differences between the two plan periods and between geographical regions. The evidence is helpful for understanding what have motivated Chinese firms to disclose carbon emission information in the two different plan periods and in different geographical areas. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Carbon disclosure; legitimacy; stakeholder theory; sustainable","Coastal zones; Logistic regression; Profitability; Sustainable development; Carbon disclosures; Carbon reduction; Coding techniques; Geographical area; Legitimacy theories; Quantitative data; Social responsibilities; Stakeholder theory; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088322638

Consequently, quantitative analysis including ecological processes and assessments on how ecosystem services are impacted by design decisions can be absent from typical landscape design work-flows.

PM2.5 with a diameter of fewer than 2.5 μm can penetrate deep into the lungs and cause health concerns, including cardiovascular disease. In this study, the hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal, and annual changes of PM2.5 pollutants and its effect on cardiovascular outcome IHD (ischemic heart disease) in a period of 10 years (2008–2017) in Ahvaz were investigated. Also, air quality was investigated for PM2.5 pollutants based on air quality index (AQI). Data validation was performed using WHO criteria. The average time PM2.5 was calculated and its health effects were obtained by entering its annual data and population at-risk, baseline incidence (BI), and relative risk (RR) for IHD outcomes. The average concentration of PM2.5 pollutants in all time changes in Ahvaz was higher than the standard concentration set by WHO. The AQI showed that the city of Ahvaz did not have a good day at all during the 10-year period. Time changes and the air quality index AQI showed that 2010 was the most polluted year with 47 unhealthy (a level that may have harmful impacts on patients and members of sensitive groups) days and 27 dangerous (a level that may have a serious impact on patients and members of sensitive groups in case of acute exposure) days. Also, with the increase in the annual concentration of PM2.5, the mortality attributed to this pollutant has increased as a result of the outcome of IHD.

The primary aim of this study is to examine the applicability of an up-to-date forecast algorithm, namely dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), in provincial CO2 emission prediction. The testing results validate the accuracy and application value of the DMD short-run forecast, which may provide method reference for relevant policy formulation and research areas. Moreover, the 2020 provincial economic situation and CO2 emissions in China are projected via DMD. On this basis, the unqualified provinces regarding CO2 emission reduction are identified considering the relative standard and absolute standard, and the corresponding mitigation paths are proposed through decoupling analysis and shadow price calculation. The results indicate that the unqualified provinces include Heilongjiang, Gansu, Shanxi, Hebei, Liaoning, Jilin, Shaanxi, and Inner Mongolia. The open-emission-reduction mechanism should be adopted in the first five provinces; the conservative one should be applied in the other provinces.

Moreover, an unfavorable opinion climate reduces one's willingness to comment and give other commenters a thumbsup, but remarkably encourages the tendency to give a thumbs-down. Support from family also fosters the use of a thumbs-down button. In addition, perceived online anonymity facilitates commenting, and perceived congruity with the reported opinion in news and issue involvement motivate news sharing.

China’s INDCs is to reduce carbon intensity by 60-65% in 2030 (compared to 2005) and promote non-fossil energy consumption proportion in primary energy consumption to 20%. On one hand, China has accomplished its 2020 carbon intensity target in 2017; on the other hand, China also faces certain difficulties achieving the target of 15% non-fossil energy consumption proportion in 2020 and 20% in 2030. Setting appropriate annual overall renewable electricity consumption (REC) and allocating it at sub-national scales can help China reach both carbon intensity and non-fossil energy consumption proportion targets. To this end, we couple the “top-down” and “zero sum gains-data envelopment analysis (ZSG-DEA)” models to form a comprehensive model for the appropriate allocation of REC. First, the “top-down” model was used to calculate the annual overall REC based on the non-fossil energy proportion target. Second, we applied the multi-principle “ZSG-DEA” model to allocate the overall REC effectively among provinces. Based on our analysis, the total REC which can be reached by Chinese government’s policy of renewable electricity consumption guarantee mechanism (REC guarantee mechanism) still needs to increase by 15.36 to 20.25% compared with the overall REC calculated by our effectiveness model. In order to achieve non-fossil energy target, 26 provinces need to increase the consumption of renewable electricity compared to their initial shares required by the REC mechanism, most of which are developed coastal areas. Our empirical results provide a scientific basis for the Chinese government to achieve its non-fossil energy targets through the REC guarantee mechanism. We also provide policy makers with ideas for determining the total amount of REC and adjusting the province’s consumption responsibility. © 2020 Zhang, Gao, Xu and Xie.","Allocation; Intended Nationally Determined Contributions (INDCs); Renewable electricity consumption; Top-down model; Zero sum gains-data envelopment analysis (ZSG-DEA)","Carbon; Data envelopment analysis; Energy utilization; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Chinese Government; Comprehensive model; Effectiveness models; Non-fossil energies; Power structures; Primary energy consumption; Renewable electricity; Renewable energies; Electric power utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087335249

In order to study the combustion behaviors of hydrocarbons under different pressures and atmospheres, a methane/air jet flame is used as the simulation target, with modifications on its oxidizer species and operating pressure. A Large Eddy Simulation (LES) with a tabulated chemistry model is employed, whose lookup tables are constructed by using a 2-D counterflow diffusion flame under different atmosphere and pressure conditions. The original flame with detailed experimental data is used for the validation of the model accuracy, and the simulation results show good agreement with the experiments. The detailed profiles of the temperature, species, and mixture fraction are analyzed. Compared with the air-fired, the flame in the oxy atmosphere is shorter and thinner. Important species and radicals are compared. The comparison shows that under elevated pressure, the differences caused by oxy atmosphere is similar to those found under atmospheric pressure. With the elevation of pressure from 0.1 MPa to 1.5 MPa, the flame height becomes smaller while the radial width is larger near the inlet, which can be observed in both air-fired and oxy-fired conditions. Under elevated pressures, the flame temperature changes slightly, but CO production increases noticeably in the fuel-rich regions. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Large-Eddy Simulation; oxy-fuel combustion; pressurized combustion; Tabulated chemistry","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric pressure; Carbon dioxide; Fuels; Large eddy simulation; Methane; Table lookup; Combustion behavior; Counterflow diffusion flames; Different pressures; Flame temperatures; Operating pressure; Oxyfuel combustion; Pressure conditions; Tabulated chemistry; Combustion",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85087150531

The article collects and analyses existing academic literature, online materials, and official reports. It is found that BSSs attract people with the same characteristics, and Western and Eastern users have different characteristics; some common factors promote people's use of BSSs in different regions. The government or enterprises introduce BSSs for different purposes: for reducing congestion or for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Most of the impacts caused by BSSs are positive, but some impacts, such as model substitution and environmental benefits, do not seem to achieve the expected goals.

The current technology is energy intensive, a major source of greenhouse gas emissions and harmful fluoride emissions. Carbothermal reduction of bauxite is a promising alternative technology for aluminium and aluminoalloy production. Western Australia and Queensland bauxite ores were carbothermally reduced in steps in argon. Experiments were performed in a high temperature vertical tube furnace, and the off-gas composition was monitored using an infra-red gas analyser. The phase composition of reduced samples was characterised by XRD. Oxygen and carbon contents in reduced samples were determined by LECO analysers. The morphology of the surface and intersections was observed by SEM. The chemical compositions of the phases in the reduced samples were detected by EDS. The results of this study have proved the concept of stepwise reduction of bauxite ores in solid state by appropriate control of reduction temperature.

The HOFA technology installs the nozzles of high-speed over-fired air (HOFA) above the existing over-fired air nozzles on the boiler. The nozzles of HOFA are connected with the main pipe of hot primary air, and the surplus hot primary air at high pressure is sent into the boiler furnace through the nozzles of HOFA. Then deep air-staged combustion in the direction of the height of the furnace is formed, thus the generation of NOx can be effectively suppressed. The three-dimensional numerical simulation was carried out using Fluent software, and the mechanism and influences of HOFA on in-furnace flow field, temperature field, CO concentration field and NOx concentration field were studied. The principle of HOFA technology was revealed and the optimized of actual HOFA operation scheme was obtained. The experiments were carried out both before and after the HOFA retrofit, and results showed that after using HOFA, the NOx (at 6% O2) at the furnace outlet was 365 mg/Nm3 (at 100% load) and 243 mg/Nm3 (at 75% load), which was 33-53 mg/Nm3 lower than that before the retrofit, while CO was still maintained at a low level.

The idea is to produce electrolytic magnesium in Qinghai Province and transport the magnesium to Eastern China where it is converted to hydrogen. Qinghai Province has abundant solar power, wind power and hydropower, and there is also abundant of magnesium chloride, which is the raw material for the production of electrolytic magnesium. Magnesium is light metal with stable chemical properties, non-toxic and harmless, so large-scale transportation of magnesium is economical and safe. Magnesium-water reaction produces hydrogen and magnesium oxide. This reaction can be carried out under high pressure, thus directly obtaining high pressure and high-quality hydrogen product. Magnesium oxide is converted into magnesium carbonate by absorbing carbon dioxide, which is a safe, permanent and stable carbon sequestration method. The above hydrogen production and carbon sequestration reactions are exothermic reactions, which can be coupled to heat engine for power generation.

The huge waste volumes result in two obvious consequences and cost drivers;fast declining reservoir pressure and tremendous power used to handle it. Produced water reinjection hasbeen used as a main strategy for both managing produced water volumes and supporting reservoir pressure.Treating produced water subsea as close as possible to the production wells has several advantages suchas smaller topside footprint, minimizing the energy demand and associated emissions, reducing the wellback pressure and increasing production rates. While some work has been done in the past on subsea use ofdeoiling hydrocyclones, robust high performance subsea produced water treatment equipment and processeshave not yet been made available. The Compact Flotation Unit (CFU) is a well proven technology for topsideuse and has been considered promising for subsea use, but never before been tested at subsea relevantpressures. Aker Solutions with partners Aker BP, Equinor and Total and support from Research Council ofNorway have successfully run a joint industry project to qualify this technology for subsea application. Pilot testing of a subsea CFU was carried out in Equinor's large scale test facilities in Porsgrunn, usingcrude oil, natural gas and synthetic produced water. The pilot CFU was tested with pressures significantlyabove that used for conventional topside CFUs, and at various temperatures. Gas bubbles were injectedby use of ejectors designed to provide the desired bubble size. Oil droplet size, flow rate and oil in waterconcentration were the major control variables in addition to pressure and temperature. The effect ofinjection of flocculant was also investigated. The main topic of interest was the oil removal efficiency ofthe CFU under high pressure. The analyses of the results showed that the CFU's efficiency improved with increase of the operationalpressure. This was likely to be related to the changes of physical properties of gas, oil and water aspressure increases, and the changing balance between physical phenomena in the process. The CFU alsodemonstrated robust performance with a large turndown ratio. Test of flocculant at high pressure showed instant and substantial improvement in the CFU efficiency,and the effect of flocculant was not compromised by the high pressure. The promising results suggest that CFU performs well at elevated pressure and is a viable solution forsubsea produced water treatment. © 2020, Offshore Technology Conference.",,"Flocculation; Flotation; Gas industry; High pressure effects; Offshore oil well production; Offshore oil wells; Offshore technology; Petroleum industry; Produced Water; Water treatment; Increasing production; Joint industry projects; Large-scale test facilities; Oil and gas production; Oil removal efficiencies; Pressure and temperature; Produced water reinjection; Reservoir pressures; Reservoir management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086239667

However, little work has been able to meaningfully reflect the collaborative way in which provinces are assigned targets on a subnational regional basis. Suggesting a meta-frontier allocation approach by using data envelopment analysis (DEA), this chapter introduces the potential collaboration between heterogeneous industrial units to the modelling framework. Our theoretical work exposits the roles collectives of industrial decision making units may play in optimizing against multiple target functions, doing so whilst recognizing the two objectives of income maximization and pollution abatement cost minimization. Considering the period 2012–2014, we illustrate clearly how China’s three regional collaborations interact with the stated aims of national policy. Developed eastern China may take on greater abatement tasks in the short term, thus freeing central and western China to pursue the economic growth which will then support later abatement. Policymakers are thus given a tool through which an extra layer of implementation can be evaluated between the national allocation and setting targets for regional individual decision making units. China’s case perfectly exemplifies the conflicts which must be accounted for if the most economical and efficient outcomes are to be achieved. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon abatement cost; Carbon allocation; Data envelopment analysis; Regional collaboration",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85086116976

As the “green purchase” clauses are regulated in the government procurement law, Taiwan sets a world precedent and becomes the first state to legislate to promote “green procurement”. The issue arises that leisure hotels face sustainable operation and green energy protection within the climate of reduced customer sources and fierce competition. The paper hence explores three aspects of “purchase, operation and marketing” to evaluate the weight of willingness and decide the priority in association with application of AHP and 12 experts. With the analysis of the AHP, senior executives in the industry expressed there is difficulty in promoting ""production history"" and ""supply chain management"". Though recently there have been many food safety incidents in Taiwan, enterprises are pursuing profits instead of emphasizing enterprise social responsibility. In this regard, this study is concerned with how companies pay attention to public issues in business decision-making and contribute to social responsibility despite of reasonable profit-making.

However, the problem of harmonic pollution in power systems is becoming increasingly severe. A harmonic on-line monitoring system is required for statistically analyzing the harmonic distribution rule in a power network and for taking harmonic suppression measures. For solving the frequent topology adjustment issue in practical distribution networks, a new observability analysis method is proposed. The probability of a switch having a closed status is used to express the nodal observability degree in consideration of network topology changes. The condition number of the measurement matrix is used as the index for estimating the precision of the harmonic state. An optimal placement model of harmonic measuring devices is presented, which considers the system observability and the condition number of the measurement matrix. The genetic algorithm (GA) is improved to solve the optimal model. A simulation model is developed based on the improved IEEE33-node system. The simulation results demonstrate the validity of the optimal harmonic measuring device placement model in distribution networks. © 2013 IEEE.","Distribution network; harmonic state estimation; observability analysis; phasor measurement units","Electric network analysis; Emission control; Energy conservation; Genetic algorithms; Matrix algebra; Number theory; Observability; Topology; Variable speed drives; Emission reduction; Harmonic distribution; Harmonic suppression; Observability analysis; On-line monitoring system; System observability; Topology adjustments; Variable frequency drives; Harmonic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085199209

In this research, we propose a vehicle trajectory data based variable speed limit (VSL) controller to improve mobility and environmental performance of motorways. First, a model based estimator is designed to estimate traffic states using data directly derived from probe vehicle with spacing measurement equipment (PVSMEs). Extended kalman filter (EKF) and METANET model are employed as the data assimilation tool and the process model for the estimator, respectively. Next, we incorporate the estimator with a model predictive control (MPC) to realize optimal VSL control. Finally, a 3.2km stretch in Auckland, New Zealand is selected and simulated to evaluate the proposed VSL under various PVSME penetration rates and traffic scenarios. The simulation results reveal that the PVSME-based VSL controller offers an effective solution to improve mobility and environmental performance of motorways. With an increase in PVSME penetration rates, the mobility and environmental benefits of the PVSME-based VSL increase. © 2013 IEEE.","Emission reduction; motorway control; trajectory data; travel time reduction","Controllers; Environmental management; Extended Kalman filters; Highway traffic control; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Effective solution; Environmental benefits; Environmental performance; Measurement equipment; Model-based estimator; Penetration rates; Variable speed limits; Vehicle trajectories; Vehicle performance",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085194251

It is affected by time and space. At the same time, people’s attitudes toward air pollution are also worth noting. People with different pollutants may have different sensitivities. In order to compare this characteristic, this paper selects the historical data of air pollution in China’s Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei, Yangtze River Delta and Pearl River Delta cities for statistical and emotion analysis. Pollution in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region is higher than other regions, but the improvement in the past few years is relatively high. The air quality in the Pearl River Delta is the best, but the improvement is low, and even there is a downward trend in some periods. The pollution in the spring and winter is generally serious. Then we use the ARIMA model to predict the future trend of various air pollutants, and find that although the overall air pollution shows a downward trend, especially PM2.5, PM10 is much reduced, but ozone has an upward trend and often becomes an important pollution in summer. In order to understand people’s attention to ozone pollution, we crawl the microblog data under the same pollution conditions of ozone and PM2.5 in Beijing for 6 days for emotional analysis, and find that people’s prevention and attention to ozone pollution is less than PM2.5. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Air pollution prediction; Emotional analysis; Ozone; PM2.5; Statistical analysis","Air quality; Autoregressive moving average model; Ozone; Quality control; Rivers; Sentiment analysis; Air pollution in chinas; Beijing-tianjin-hebei regions; Emotional analysis; Focus of Attention; Pearl River delta; Quality statistic; Urban agglomerations; Yangtze river delta; River pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085186982

But those trains of urban rail transit have also generated more and more energy consumption. In order to alleviate the energy shortage and promote energy conservation and emission reduction, it is of great significance to reduce the energy consumption of subway trains. The optimization control of energy-efficient driving is to reduce the energy consumption of trains when operating and improve the operation efficiency. The traditional particle swarm optimization algorithm is easy to fall into the local optimum and the global performance is not so good. In this paper, the genetic particle swarm optimization algorithm (GA-PSO) is used, combining the advantages of genetic algorithm and particle swarm algorithm, to optimize the energy consumption of trains. And MATLAB is used to carry out modeling and simulation analysis. Compared with the traditional particle swarm and genetic algorithm, the optimized algorithm is verified that it can effectively reduce the energy consumption of trains. The results show that the energy cost is reduced by 18.8%, which verifies the effectiveness of the developed algorithm. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.","Energy-efficient optimization; GA-PSO algorithm; Particle swarm algorithm","Emission control; Energy utilization; Genetic algorithms; Light rail transit; MATLAB; Particle swarm optimization (PSO); Energy conservation and emission reductions; Genetic particle swarm optimizations; Model and simulation; Operation efficiencies; Optimization control; Optimized algorithms; Particle swarm algorithm; Particle swarm optimization algorithm; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85085185073

First, the stability conditions of the equilibrium points in the system are discussed, and the stable region of the Nash equilibrium is determined. Then, the bifurcation diagram, maximal Lyapunov exponent, strange attractor, and sensitive dependence on the initial conditions are shown through numerical simulations. The research shows that the adjustment speed of three players' decisions may alter the stability of the Nash equilibrium point and lead to chaos in the system. Among these decisions, a government's decision has the largest effect on the system. In addition, we find that some parameters will affect the stability of the system; when the parameters become beneficial for enterprises to reduce nitrogen emissions, the increase in the parameters can help control the chaotic market. Finally, the delay feedback control method is used to successfully control the chaos in the system and stabilize it at the Nash equilibrium point.

Recently, exploring the driving path of low-carbon development has become the hot topic, however, the role of energy consumption in the carbon-reduction effect of technological innovation has been ignored. Based on China's provincial-level panel data from 2005 to 2016, this paper investigates the effect of technological innovation on energy saving and carbon emissions reduction and the role of energy consumption in the influencing process by using linear regression model, mediating effect model and threshold regression model. The results show that technological innovation has effectively promoted energy saving and carbon emissions reduction in China, with different effect coefficients between the three areas of China. Moreover, energy consumption plays a significant partial mediating role in the effect of technological innovation on carbon emissions reduction. Finally, the effect of technological innovation on carbon emissions is limited by energy consumption. Low energy consumption significantly promotes a reduction in carbon emissions through technological innovation. Once energy consumption exceeds a critical level, the promoting effect of technological innovation on carbon emissions reduction will turn into the inhibiting effect. Based on these findings, some policy recommendations are put forward to accelerate the low-carbon transformation of the economy. © 2013 IEEE.","carbon emissions reduction; China; energy saving; Technological innovation; threshold regression model","Emission control; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Regression analysis; Carbon emissions reductions; Linear regression models; Low carbon transformations; Low energy consumption; Low-carbon development; Policy recommendations; Technological innovation; Threshold regression models; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084960189

Reducing the dynamic load of mechanical systems and their components is reflected in the working environment by reduced emissions and immissions of noise and vibration. The presented paper investigates the methods and conditions for noise and vibration control, focusing mainly on increasing the quality of rotating machine components, such as bearings by means of effective vibration isolation of the machines. The solution of this problem requires theoretical analysis and methodology for the measurement of the mechanical systems involved. The results of the vibroacoustic measurements were analysed in terms of the low frequency vibration and noise level (quality) of bearings and conditions for effective vibration isolation of the machines using vibroacoustic diagnostic method. Furthermore, the impact on the working environment was also analysed. Finally, the paper suggests some actions to be taken to effectively reduce the unwanted vibrosound energy in working places, also using recycled material as a vibration isolation element. © 2020 Polish Academy of Sciences.

Witte Moscow University, Moscow, Russian Federation","Аfter the breakup of the U.S.S.R., Japan began developing and implementing its foreign policy towards Central Asia (CA). Japan’s attention to countries in the region was determined by its long-term economic and political interests. First and foremost, Japan was interested in gaining access to the assets of CA countries: their fuel and energy complex and mineral deposits. The need to address this problem was dictated by the country’s limited natural resources and its heavy dependence on hydrocarbon imports. Accordingly, Japanese policy was aimed to gain unimpeded access to the hydrocarbon resources of CA countries and create reliable export routes for oil and gas in the interests of its own economy. This is why the creation of alternative pipeline routes for transporting oil and gas from Central Asia was a key goal for Japan. But its achievement was hindered by Central Asia’s geographical remoteness. As a result, Japan lost out to China, which borders on CA countries. Nevertheless, Japan proposed a number of pipeline projects that should have given it access to Central Asian resources, mainly through Chinese territory. Japan tried to create multilateral formats of cooperation with CA countries by launching various initiatives. But Tokyo’s efforts failed to produce a positive result in view of the disunity and heterogeneity of countries in the region, which did not constitute a single geopolitical unit. Domestic political processes in the CA countries developed differently as they faced a set of economic and social problems. As a result, Japan built its policy regarding the Central Asian countries mainly on a bilateral basis. Of particular interest to Japan were Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, and Turkmenistan, which have significant oil and gas reserves. Although Japan’s long-term goals have practically not changed over time, its Central Asia policy can be divided into several stages, each of which has its own specific features determined by the development of the geopolitical situation in Central Asia, the influence of other extra-regional states on countries in the region, and the interests of the Central Asian countries. In recent years, Japan has actively implemented its policy by expanding bilateral cooperation while retaining an interest in multilateral cooperation formats. © 2020, CA and C Press AB.

However, due to systematic or accidental failures, some air pollution measurements obtained from these stations are found to have missing values, which will adversely affect the accuracy of any follow-up air pollution analyses and the quality of environmental decision-makings. In this study, the mathematical property of air quality measurements is investigated to recover the missing air pollution values. A new algorithm, which matches meteorology data with air pollution data from different locations, to reconstruct the data matrix and recover missing entries, is proposed. Next, a Low Rank Matrix Completion problem is used to reconstruct the missing values, by transforming the data recovery problem to a sub-gradient primal-dual problem, based on the duality theory, with Singular Value Thresholding (SVT) employed to develop sub-optimal solutions. Next, an Interpolation-SVT (ISVT) approach is adopted to handle the sparsity of observed measurements. Comprehensive case studies are conducted to evaluate the performance of the proposed methods. The simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed SVT and ISVT methods can effectively recover the missing air pollution data and outperform existing interpolation methods and data imputation techniques. The proposed study can improve air pollution estimation and prediction whenever the low-rank data types that are used as proxies for air pollution estimation contain a lot of missing values and require data recovery. © 2013 IEEE.","air pollution control policy-making; interpolation; low rank matrix completion; Missing data recovery; singular value thresholding","Air quality; Decision making; Estimation; Interpolation; Metadata; Recovery; Air pollution measurements; Air quality measurements; Air quality monitoring stations; Environmental decision making; Estimation and predictions; Interpolation method; Low-rank matrix completions; Mathematical properties; Matrix algebra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084331542

However, an intrinsic limitation existed for candidate selection because the technique requires post-job dissolution of the fiber that is a principal component of the success of achieving efficient channel fracturing behavior. This set a lower temperature limitation of 60°C, such that formations with temperatures below this value were not recognized as potential candidates. This project was aimed at eliminating the temperature limitation and thereby enhancing the potential candidate pool for application. The channel fracturing technique creates infinite-conductivity channels within a fracture, using a proppant-pulsing technique delivered by the surface equipment. Proppant structures are consolidated and transported along the fracture by means of fibrous material, which then degrades in the channels and proppant pillars within days after the treatment, conventionally because of the high formation temperature. Expanding hydraulic fracturing into new low-temperature oil provinces such as Eastern Siberia and the Turonian formation in the Yamal region called for adjustment in the channel fracturing technique. Specifically, surface equipment was used in a modified mode to alter the pumping schedule of the fiber additive to add fiber in pulses that are synchronized with proppant pulses. The new channel fracturing methodology was designed and tested under laboratory conditions initially and then subsequently applied in several low-temperature (20 to 30°C) oil and gas fields/wells in Russia. The first campaign yielded positive results. New software and equipment adjustments allowed for precise and accurate synchronization that resulted in fiber-free channels. The first productivity results also illustrated the potential of the technology to match or exceed the planned hydrocarbon production. The main advantages of the channel fracturing technique remained unchanged-improved barrels/dollar ratio by up to 10% compared with conventional methods and fracturing cycle operational efficiency reduction of up to 25% as compared with standard techniques. Thus, the temperature limitation was removed, leaving one major criterion for channel fracturing applicability: rock competency to hold channels open and stable throughout the life of the fracture. The study breaks new ground in the stimulation of low-temperature formations by extending the channel fracturing technique, well-recognized in the traditional basins of Russia. The project includes laboratory testing and real field examples from two regions of Russia-the first campaigns. © 2019, Society of Petroleum Engineers",,"Efficiency; Fibers; Fracture; Gas industry; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Optical pumping; Proppants; Well stimulation; Conventional methods; Formation temperature; Fracturing techniques; Hydrocarbon production; Laboratory conditions; Low temperature formation; Operational efficiencies; Temperature limitation; Temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85084165490

As the downsizing becomes widely exploited, the increased boost levels entail the exploration of dual stage boosting systems. In a context of increasing electrification, the usage of electrified boosting systems can be effective in the improvement of vehicle performances. The aim of this work is therefore to evaluate, through numerical simulation, the impact of different voltage (12 V or 48 V) electric superchargers (eSC) on an extremely downsized 1.0L engine on vehicle performance and fuel consumption over different transient manoeuvres. The virtual test rig employed for the analysis integrates a 1D CFD Fast Running Model (FRM) engine representative of a 1.0L state-of-the-art gasoline engine featuring an eSC in series with the main turbocharger, an electric network (12 V or 48 V), a six speed manual transmission and a vehicle representative of a B-SUV segment car. A preliminary assessment of the steady state performances of the 1.0L engine with the electrified dual boosting system with both 12 V and 48 V electric supercharger was performed. Then, the vehicle performances were evaluated by means of, on the one hand, vehicle elasticity manoeuvres for the performance assessment and, on the other hand, type approval and RDE driving cycles, for the fuel economy assessment. An evaluation of possible engine and vehicle hardware modifications was also carried out. In particular, the effect of a variation of the final drive ratio, the increase of the turbine size and the usage of a high efficiency engine concept (featuring an increased compression ratio from 10 to 12 and a late intake valve closing, exploiting the advantages of a Miller cycle) were investigated. © 2019 SAE International and © 2019 SAE Naples Section.

However, this industry becomes a considerable barrier against green, sound, and sustainable economic and social development due to the rapid increase in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission. Transportation industry becomes one of weakness of energy saving and emission reduction with its increasing energy consumption and carbon emission. Environmental pollution caused by the transportation industry can be relieved effectively by increasing energy efficiency. A case study based on Jilin Province, China is carried out. First, environmental pollution types caused by regional transportation industry are analysed. Second, energy efficiency of transportation industry in eight prefecture-level cities in Jilin Province from 2011 to 2017 is determined using the DEA-Malmquist index. Finally, measures to control environmental pollution caused by the transportation industry are proposed. Results show that in Jilin Province, environmental pollution caused by the transportation industry manifests through increasing energy consumption, pollution from car exhaust, and degree of traffic jams. In its eight prefecture-level cities, the average energy efficiency change index of transportation industry is 1.054, which is higher than 1. The means of technological efficiency and progress are 0.973 and 1.084, respectively. The mean pure technological efficiency of energy use slightly increases, while the mean scale efficiency decreases significantly. Results can provide beneficial references for full understanding on energy consumption and environmental emission of transportation industry in Jilin Province.

Hence, modifying or developing suitable semiconductors with high efficiency of photocatalytic CO2 reduction property has become a topic of interest to scientists. In this study, a series of Mo-modified Cs0.33WO3 tungsten bronze were prepared using a “water-controllable releasing” solvothermal method to produce effective photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance. Interestingly, Mo atoms replaced W partially within the hexagonal crystal structure, leading to a significant increase in photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity of Cs0.33WO3. The 5% Modoped compound displayed the best performance, with the production yield rates of 7.5 µmol g−1 h−1 for CO and 3.0 µmol g−1 h−1 for CH3OH under low concentration of CO2 under anaerobic conditions, which is greatly higher than those of pure Cs0.33WO3 (3.2 µmol g−1 h−1 for CO and 1.2 µmol g−1h−1 for CH3OH) and Mo-doped W18O49 (1.5 µmol g−1 h−1 for CO and 0 µmol g−1 h−1 for CH3OH). More importantly, the as-prepared Mo-doped Cs0.33WO3 series could also induce the photocatalytic reduction of CO2 directly from the air in the presence of oxygen, which is beneficial for practical applications. The superior photocatalytic performance of Mo-doped Cs0.33WO3 series over the popular reduced WO3 may be due to the increase in light absorption induced by the localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) effect of Mo5+, large improved charge separation ability, and the co-effect of Mo and Cs in crystal. This study provides a simple strategy for designing highly efficient photocatalysts in low concentration of CO2 reduction. © 2020, Science China Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","charge separation; CO2 reduction; Cs0.33WO3; low concentration; photocatalytic performance","Bronze; Carbon dioxide; Crystal atomic structure; Energy policy; Light absorption; Nanorods; Photocatalytic activity; Surface plasmon resonance; Tungsten; Tungsten compounds; Charge separations; CO2 reduction; Cs0.33WO3; Low concentrations; Photocatalytic performance; Molybdenum",Article,"Article in Press","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082969689

Furthermore, the favorable segment of unconventional natural gas and gas types was discussed based on a typical well. Results show that the Lianyuan Depression in the central Hunan Province has significant potential for unconventional natural gas development. Coal, shale, and sandstone are widely distributed and are interbedded, leading to the co-existence of coalbed methane, tight sand gas, and shale gas, which can form multiple sets of “source-reservoir-cap assemblages” and two modes “single source-double storage” and “double source-more storage” and four corresponding gas types are proposed. Among them, coalbed methane and tight sand gas have great potential for co-development in the Lianyuan Depression. Coal plays a decisive role and acts as a primary source rock.

In this paper, a novel tripartite evolutionary game theory is proposed to examine the behavioral strategies of government, banks, and the grid enterprises in the low-carbon power grid technology innovation cooperation. The evolutionary replication dynamics equations are presented to study evolutionary stable strategies (ESS) of participants. The meaningful simulation results are as follows: from the subsidy perspective, even if the government subsidies are phasing out, the ESS of the low-carbon grid technology cooperation still converges to the Pareto optimal equilibrium; from the cost perspective, the higher low-carbon technology innovation cost only slows down the evolution rate, while the higher business cost of carbon asset pledge credit and the lower incentive cost not only slow down the evolution rate but also change the evolution results. It shows that the business cost of carbon asset pledge credit has a greater impact on the evolution of the system than the incentive cost; from the benefit perspective, increasing the green revenue and the successful probability of the low-carbon technology innovation can both prompt the ESS to evolve to Pareto optimal state, and the effect of the former is greater than the latter. These results provide a theoretical guidance for government to promote the development of low-carbon technology innovation of power grid. © 2013 IEEE.","government intervention; low-carbon technology innovation; Power grid enterprises; tripartite evolution game","Carbon; Competition; Costs; Engineering research; Game theory; Pareto principle; Evolutionary game theory; Evolutionary stable strategies; Government intervention; Low-carbon technologies; Power grid technology; Power grids; Resource utilizations; tripartite evolution game; Electric power transmission networks",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082305278

Computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model coupled with the gasoline-ethanol surrogate mechanism can be used for fuel design. A semi-detailed mechanism (278 species and 1439 reactions) at medium and low temperatures and experiments in a homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) engine for the oxidation of gasoline-ethanol surrogates were presented in this paper. The initial mechanism derived from detailed primary reference fuel and semi-detailed ethanol mechanisms. In order to get a smaller-size model, directed relation graph with error propagation (DRGEP) method was used to remove insignificant components efficiently, and quasi-steady state assumption (QSSA) method was used to identify the species in quasi-steady-state. Subsequently, some elementary reactions involving the formation and consumption of H and OH radicals were revised and the kinetic parameters of the relevant elementary reactions were adjusted. To validate the mechanism, the HCCI experiments for the oxidation of gasoline-ethanol surrogates were conducted under different operating conditions. The new mechanism was also compared with the literature model by Li et al. (2019) under the selected operating conditions. The present mechanism can not only perform macro analysis of HCCI combustion process, but also can be coupled with CFD software to perform transient in-cylinder micro-field analysis efficiently. © 2020, Interamerican Society for Electron Microscopy (CIASEM).

This calls for scientific evaluation of net carbon sink (NCS) and its spatiotemporal evolution of farmland vegetation in a region. Taking 38 districts/counties of Chongqing, China as objects, this paper estimates the farmland vegetation NCS of Chongqing, based on statistics of crop yields and farmland inputs in 2000-2017. Then, geographical techniques were employed to analyze the features, regional difference and spatial evolution of NCS in Chongqing and its districts/counties. The main results are as follows: (1) From 2000 to 2017, the NCS and NCS strength (NCSS) of farmland vegetation in Chongqing both increased with fluctuations. The carbon sink, carbon emissions and carbon absorption increased across the board. The evolution of farmland vegetation can be divided into a wavy decline phase from 2000 to 2006, and a gradual increase phase from 2006 to 2017. (2) The source/sink structure of farmland vegetation in Chongqing remained stable in 2000-2017. The main sources are pesticide and tillage, and the main sinks are corn, rice, vegetables and oil crops. (3) In term of space, the farmland vegetation NCS and its center of gravity concentrated in the west zone and northeast zone. In general, the farmland vegetation of Chongqing boasts a strong carbon sink function; the west zone and northeast zone have the highest farmland vegetation NCSs; the west zone is the demonstration region of NCSS improvement. © 2020 WITPress.

Foliar application of Paenibacillus polymyxa biofertilizer has been proven to be beneficial for organic tea production. In this study, tea yield and quality were significantly improved after application of P. polymyxa biofertilizer compared with the control but were not significantly different from chemical fertilizer treatments. However, the average N2O fluxes in tea fields treated with chemical fertilizers and biofertilizers (225 kg N·ha−1·year−1 for both) were 50.6–973.7 and 0.6–29.1 times higher than those in the control treatment, respectively. Pot experiments conducted to explore the mechanism of N2O reduction induced by P. polymyxa biofertilizer showed that applying P. polymyxa in addition to urea could reduce N2O fluxes by 36.5%–73.1%. Quantitative PCR analysis suggested that a significant increase in the quantity of nirK and nosZ genes was linked to the reduction of N2O, and high-throughput sequencing of nosZ revealed active and potentially efficient denitrifiers in different treatments. Our findings suggest that P. polymyxa biofertilizer is in line with the requirements of modern agriculture, which aims to increase product yield and quality while reducing negative environmental impacts. © 2020, Canadian Science Publishing.

This paper analyzes and quantifies the relationship between industrialization, energy systems, and carbon emissions. Firstly, it forecasts the global and regional industrialization trends under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) and Shared Socioeconomic Pathway2 (SSP2) scenarios. Then, it projects the global and regional energy consumption that aligns with the industrialization trend, and optimizes the global energy supply system using the Model for Energy Supply Strategy Alternatives and their General Environmental Impact (MESSAGE) model for the industrial sector. Moreover, it develops an expanded Kaya identity to comprehensively investigate the drivers of industrial carbon emissions. In addition, it employs a Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index (LMDI) approach to track the historical contributions of various drivers of carbon emissions, as well as predictions into the future. This paper finds that economic development and population growth are the two largest drivers for historical industrial CO2 emissions, and that carbon intensity and industry energy intensity are the top two drivers for the decrease of future industrial CO2 emissions. Finally, it proposes three modes, i.e., clean supply, electrification, and energy efficiency for industrial emission reduction. © 2020 by the authors","Industrial CO2 emission; Industrialization; Kaya identity; LMDI approach; MESSAGE model","Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Economics; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy resources; Population statistics; CO2 emissions; Industrialization; Kaya identity; LMDI approach; MESSAGE model; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079670163

The passenger flow proportion of different transportation types is changing along with the adjustment of the urban traffic structure and a growing demand from passengers. The reduction of carbon emissions brought about by rail transit lacks specific quantitative research. Based on a travel survey of urban residents, this paper constructed a method of estimating carbon emissions from two different scenarios where rail transit is and is not available. This study uses the traditional four-stage model to forecast passenger volume demand at the city level and then obtains the basic target parameters for constructing the carbon emission reduction model, including the trip origin-destination (OD), mode, and corresponding distance range of different modes on the urban road network. This model was applied to Baoji, China, where urban rail transit will be available from 2023. It calculates the changes in carbon emission that rail transit can bring about and its impact on carbon emission reductions in Baoji in 2023. © 2020 by the authors.","Carbon emission reduction; Four-stage model; Passenger demand; Residents’ trip survey; Urban rail transit","Carbon; Emission control; Light rail transit; Surveys; Traffic control; Carbon emission reductions; Four-stage model; Origin destination; Passenger demands; Quantitative research; Traffic pollution; Urban rail transit; Urban road networks; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079574808

In addition, it is verified that the regulators should not blindly pursue a reduction in carbon emissions regardless of the cost. Therefore, regulators need to pay more attention to control the costs of carbon capture equipment and technology.

Vegetation dynamics is defined as a significant indictor in regulating terrestrial carbon balance and climate change, and this issue is important for the evaluation of climate change. Though much work has been done concerning the correlations among vegetation dynamics, precipitation and temperature, the related questions about relationships between vegetation dynamics and other climatic factors (e.g., specific humidity, net radiation, soil moisture) have not been thoroughly considered. Understanding these questions is of primary importance in developing policies to address climate change. Methods. In this study, the least squares regression analysis method was used to simulate the trend of vegetation dynamics based on the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) from 1981 to 2018. A partial correlation analysis method was used to explore the relationship between vegetation dynamics and climate change; and further,the revised greyscale model was applied to predict the future growth trend of natural vegetation. Results. The Mann-Kendall test results showed that th e air temperature rose sharply in 1997 and had been in a state of high fluctuations since then. Strong changes in hydrothermal conditions had major impact on vegetation dynamics in the area. Specifically, the NDVI value of natural vegetation showed an increasing trend from 1981 to 2018, and the same changes occurred in the precipitation. From 1981 to 1997, the values of natural vegetation increased at a rate of 0.0016 per year. From 1999 to 2009, the NDVI value decreased by an average rate of 0.0025 per year. From 2010 to 2018, the values began an increasing trend and reached a peak in 2017, with an average annual rate of 0.0033. The high vegetation dynamics areas were mainly concentrated in the north and south slopes of the Tianshan Mountains, the Ili River Valley and the Altay area. The greyscale prediction results showed that the annual average NDVI values of natural vegetation may present a fluctuating increasing trend. The NDVI value in 2030 is 0.0196 higher than that in 2018, with an increase of 6.18%. Conclusions. Our results indicate that: (i) the variations of climatic factors have caused a huge change in the hydrothermal conditions in Xinjiang; (ii) the vegetation dynamics in Xinjiang showed obvious volatility, and then in the end stage of the study were higher than the initial stage the vegetation dynamics in Xinjiang showed a staged increasing trend; (iii) the vegetation dynamics were affected by many factors,of which precipitation was the main reason; (iv) in the next decade, the vegetation dynamics in Xinjiang will show an increasing trend. © 2020 Zhuang et al.","Climate change; Greyscale model; Hydrology; Partial correlation; Precipitation; Prediction; Temperature; Vegetation dynamics; Xinjiang","air temperature; article; climate change; correlation analysis; hydrology; intermethod comparison; least square analysis; precipitation; prediction; river; vegetation dynamics; Xinjiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85079089414

Thus, understanding city-scale CO2 emissions and how they vary between cities with different urban densities is a critical task. While the relationship between CO2 emissions and population density has been explored widely in prior studies, their conclusions were sensitive to inconsistent definitions of urban boundaries and the reliance upon CO2 emission inventories that implicitly assumed population relationships. Here we provide the first independent estimates of direct per capita CO2 emissions (E pc) from spaceborne atmospheric CO2 measurements from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2) for a total 20 cities across multiple continents. The analysis accounts for the influence of meteorology on the satellite observations with an atmospheric model. The resultant upwind source region sampled by the satellite serves as an objective urban extent for aggregating emissions and population densities. Thus, we are able to detect emission 'hotspots' on a per capita basis from a few cities, subject to sampling restrictions from OCO-2. Our results suggest that E pc declines as population densities increase, albeit the decrease in E pc is partially limited by the positive correlation between E pc and per capita gross domestic product. As additional CO2-observing satellites are launched in the coming years, our space-based approach to understanding CO2 emissions from cities has significant potential in tracking and evaluating the future trajectory of urban growth and informing the effects of carbon reduction plans. © 2020 The Author(s).

Here, we report efficient sky-blue PeLEDs with high brightness based on mixed-ligand confined quasi-2D perovskites. By detailed characterization of the optical and physicochemical properties of n-butylammonium (BA) or 2-phenylethylammonium (PEA)-based perovskites with various alkyl ammonium bromides as co-ligands, it is found that the molecular size and charge on the amino-groups of the co-ligand hold the key to constructing effective mixed-ligand systems. Accordingly, dimethylammonium (DMA) is an ideal co-ligand in both BA- and PEA-based quasi-2D perovskites. Thanks to its appropriate molecular size, DMA could help to confine the diameter of perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) and improve their dispersity in organic ligands. Besides, DMA is prone to disperse among PEA or BA molecules to cap the perovskite synergistically, and the phase of n = 1 caused by excess co-ligands could be effectively avoided benefiting from the relatively weak coordination ability of DMA due to the relatively small positive charge on amino-groups. The optimized PeLEDs based on BA2DMA1.6Cs2Pb3Br11.6 and PEA2DMA1.2Cs2Pb3Br11.2 exhibit color-stable sky-blue (490 nm) and bluish green (499 nm) emission with a record maximum luminance of 2825 and 7760 cd m-2 respectively. The applicability of this approach in the red emission region is also demonstrated, which provides a versatile strategy for full spectrum modulation.

According to the experience in shale gas exploration and development in North America, in addition to technology improvement, quantitatively evaluating the planar distribution of liquid-rich hydrocarbons in shale gas and increasing the liquid production of an individual well are one of the approaches for increasing economic benefits. The planar distribution of different grades of hydrocarbons in Duvernay shale gas is quantitatively predicted comprehensively using the pyrolysis experiment data, carbon isotope data, gas composition data and production data based on the theory of geochemistry. According to the variation of the pyrolysis experiment parameters of samples before and after extraction, the quantitative relations of ∆S2 with Ro, ∆S2/S2 with Ro, ∆HI with Ro and ∆HI with HIunextracted are established and HIunextracted is corrected. The quantitative relations of carbon isotope, dry gas index and butane isomer with corrected HI are studied, the quantitative formulas of carbon isotope, dry gas index and butane isomer with corrected HI are established, and the HI value of wells without the pyrolysis experiment data is calculated. According to production data, the quantitative relation of HI with CGR is established, and the HI value division standard for different grades of liquid-rich hydrocarbons is determined. The planar distribution diagram of HI values is plotted, and according to the division standard for different grades of liquid-rich hydrocarbons, the planar distribution of different grades of liquid-rich hydrocarbons is predicted quantitatively. The results indicate that (1) the pyrolysis comparison experiments before and after extraction indicate that ∆S2, ∆S2/S2 and ∆HI have a good correlation with Ro, ∆HI also has good correlation with HIunextracted, and these quantitative relations can be used to correct HIunextracted. (2) The corrected HI has a very good correlation with carbon isotope, butane isomer and dry gas index, and the HI value of wells without the pyrolysis experiment data can be calculated quantitatively using the quantitative regression relations. (3) The corrected HI has a very good correlation with CGR. The quantitative division standard for liquid-rich hydrocarbons has been established according to production data, and the planar distribution of all grades of liquid hydrocarbons can be predicted according to HI. (4) The zonation of all grades of liquid hydrocarbons is obvious in the study area. The dry gas region is distributed mainly in the structural deformation belt and Leduc ring reef belt. The northeast region of the study area is mainly a rich oil region.

Our descriptor reflects the local curvature of the surface and the torsion of the π orbital system. We showed that the surface reactivity is directly related to the pyramidalization angle at the active sites. Nitrogen and boron doping makes it possible to reach a low overpotential for weakly curved surfaces, whereas for undoped surfaces the ideal ORR activity is only reached for highly curved CNTs. Consequently, the optimal size of the nanotube is determined by the doping type. Hence, we demonstrated a high statistical quality correlation between the adsorption energies of surface species and the pyramidalization angle at the active site. Our descriptor enables ready identification of the optimal diameter and the best doping type for the CNT surfaces, which is not possible with usual descriptors such as OH species adsorption. As a result, ORR geometric descriptors are very promising since their performance is comparable to that of electronic descriptors. In addition, they are less time-demanding in computation, and they are less sensitive to the accuracy of the calculation method. © 2020 the Owner Societies.",,"Boron; Electrolytic reduction; Fuel cells; Geometry; Nitrogen; Oxygen; Oxygen reduction reaction; Adsorption energies; Carbon based materials; Fuel cell technologies; Geometric descriptor; Optimal diameters; Pyramidalization angle; Statistical quality; Surface reactivity; Carbon nanotubes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077404468

Methods: A completely randomized experiment was conducted with in vitro incubation in a control group (CON, no GSPE addition; n = 9) and the treatment group (GSPE, 1 mg/bottle GSPE, 2 g/kg dry matter; n = 9). The methane and volatile fatty acid concentrations were determined using gas chromatography. To explore methane inhibition after fermentation and the response of the ruminal microbiota to GSPE, archaeal 16S rRNA genes were sequenced by MiSeq high-throughput sequencing. Results: The results showed that supplementation with GSPE could significantly inhibit gas production and methane production. In addition, GSPE treatment significantly increased the proportion of propionate, while the acetate/propionate ratio was significantly decreased. At the genus level, the relative abundance of Methanomassiliicoccus was significantly increased, while the relative abundance of Methanobrevibacter decreased significantly in the GSPE group. Conclusion: In conclusion, GSPE is a plant extract that can reduce methane production by affecting the structures of archaeal communities, which was achieved by a substitution of Methanobrevibacter with Methanomassiliicoccus. © 2020 by Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences.","Archaeal Community; Grape Seed Procyanidin Extract; Methanogenesis; MiSeq High-throughput Sequencing",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85077255758

The comparative study, with respect to climate, geography/topography, demography, urban governance and policy, etc., reveals that, while the new town system featuring high-rise high-density neighborhood and public transit-oriented development, as adopted by Singapore and Hong Kong, has effectively responded to the critical challenges such as land restriction in the progression of urbanization and evolved toward sustainable compact urban forms, the city of Shanghai seems to be influenced by the new urbanism movement mostly found in North American cities. With largely unsatisfactory government support in urban public service infrastructure and land-use planning for compact development, the intended city center redevelopment and suburbanization (the One City and Nine Towns scheme) seem to have led toward urban sprawling and deteriorating urban environment. The comparison indicates a more compact high-rise urban form may better support environmental sustainable development of Shanghai, and an integrated climate-responsive planning and design workflow are to be developed, and better inter- and cross-disciplinary communication is needed between urban climatology and urban design. For that, a framework is proposed for microclimate research and design integration for high-rise urbanism, and the parametrization of urban form on microclimate at three scales is listed for the followed case studies in Part Two. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2020.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85076925255

This was motivated by the intrinsic relationship between climate conditions and EAHE potential. Future weather files were created using general circulation model (GCM) outputs for three representative concentration pathways (RCP) scenarios and two separate timeframes. These were used in a climate-based approach for estimating EAHE potential based on their capacity to provide either heating or cooling. The results demonstrated, cooling capacity of a hypothetical EAHE system decreased and heating capacity increased due to changes in demand. The largest effects were observed for later time periods and more drastic changes to radiative forcing. From the chosen locations, heating dominated sites are most susceptible to unfavorable changes in cooling capacity due to the synchronous timing of changes in cooling capacity relative to peak demand. This work highlights the importance of conducting a climate change impact assessment on EAHE potential in these climates to ensure system effectiveness into the future.

Directive 2012/27/EU of the EU on energy efficiency it is defined that as from 2014 3% of the public buildings owned and occupied by its central government should be renovated each year to meet at least the minimum energy performance requirements. Moreover, Directive 2010/31/EU and national regulation require the application of minimum requirements to the energy performance of existing and new buildings as well as increasing the number of nearly zero-energy buildings, which will have a significant impact on the consumption of thermal energy. In order to predict the influence of the future energy efficiency measures on the efficiency of the existing DH systems, District Heating Planning Tool was used for evaluation of the particular DH system. At the output, the tool provides twelve efficiency and balance indicators with the recommended permissible limits for the evaluation of DH system development scenarios. The tool validation is based on the results of comprehensive research of already renovated buildings. As a result of complex renovation decrease in thermal energy consumption can be achieved from 35 to 50% (average 42.3%). Consistent simulations of the proposed future development scenarios for a particular DH system with different building renovation rates of 3, 5 and 7% have shown a natural reduction in thermal energy consumption in a 15-year perspective by 13.5, 22.5 and 30%.

New deposits being discovered and the elaboration of new methods of hydrocarbons extraction will allow using these resources for a long time. Nevertheless, most countries have begun to think about using solar power. This interest is caused not only by environmental problems, but also by the fact that annually 178.000 TW of solar radiation reaches our planet. To use solar energy, two methods – thermal and photovoltaic – are used. The first one involves heating up used liquid, the second one implies the conversion of sunlight into electrical energy. Containers for storing fossil fuels are installed at oil terminals. This hydrocarbon can be crude or refined oil in a form of heavy (mazut) or light (diesel) fuel. Solar energy can be used at oil terminals both for heating hydrocarbons (in order to reduce viscosity to operating parameters), and for storing electrical power. The use of solar energy will improve energy efficiency and the environmental component of a terminal. The paper presents the functioning of an oil product heating system as a sequence of events based on cause-effect relations. For a formal description of the logical structure of processes of solar energy use, the authors proposed a solution using the Petri net machine. Prerequisites for the use of Petri nets are: the presence of random and deterministic components in the process of generation of solar energy; the possibility of representing the conversion of solar energy in the form of sets of technologically homogeneous parallel processes; situational control related to the randomness of the possibility of converting solar energy. With the help of the model and by using the Petri net, conflict situations were found that could be solved by situational control. As practice shows, such kind of local situations is solved within the framework of automated control. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.","Energy efficiency; Environmental ecology; Modeling; Oil loading terminals; Petri nets; Solar panels","Energy conservation; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Hydrocarbons; Models; Oil terminals; Petri nets; Petroleum refining; Process control; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Sustainable development; Alternate energy sources; Deterministic component; Environmental problems; Oil loading terminals; Operating parameters; Sequence of events; Situational control; Solar panels; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85066811097
