These genes belong to the SLC4A gene family. This short review summarizes our knowledge of these gene products with respect to their renal distribution and function. The best characterized members are the SLC4A4 and SLC4A7. SLC4A4 codes for an electrogenic Na+, HCO 3--cotransporter (NBCe1), which is present in the basolateral membranes of proximal tubules and is responsible for the bicarbonate efflux here, and thus about 80% of the renal bicarbonate reabsorption. SLC4A7 codes for an electroneutral NBC (called NBC3 and NBCn1), which is present basolaterally in the thick ascending limb and the distal part of the collecting ducts and in intercalated cells (either apically or basolaterally) in the connecting and collecting tubules. In the thick ascending limb NBCn1 may be important for NH4+ reabsorption. SLCA5 codes for an electrogenic NBC (called NBC4 and NBCe2), which based on RT-PCR is located to the kidney but the exact localization awaits a good antibody. This is also the case for the SLC4A8 and SLC4A10 gene products, which are sodium dependent Cl-, HCO3- exchangers. The recent development in this field substantially increases our understanding of the complex renal regulation of acid base status.","Bicarbonate; Kidney; NBC; pH; Transport","bicarbonate; bicarbonate sodium cotransporter; carrier protein; gene product; sodium dependent chloride bicarbonate exchanger; unclassified drug; acid base balance; basolateral membrane; conference paper; effusion; gene location; genetic code; human; ion transport; kidney collecting tubule; kidney function; kidney proximal tubule; kidney tubule absorption; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; organ distribution; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sodium transport; Acid-Base Equilibrium; Acidosis; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Humans; Kidney; Molecular Sequence Data; Rats; Sodium-Bicarbonate Symporters",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043076334

Simultaneous all-sky imaging observations of the OI 630.0 nm and OI 777.4 nm nightglow emissions were carried out at São José dos Campos (23.21°S, 45.86°W; dip latitude 17.6°S), Brazil, during the years 2000 and 2001, a period of high solar activity. In this work we present and discuss the height-resolved nocturnal F region zonal drift velocities obtained from plasma bubbles observed in imaging observations of these two emissions for several days of 2000 and 2001. It should be pointed out that the two emissions result from different excitation mechanisms (OI 630.0 nm by dissociative recombination of O2+ and OI 777.4 nm by radiative recombination of O+) and come from different F region heights, separated by ∼50-80 km. We have investigated the nighttime zonal plasma drift variations using fixed emission peak altitudes, used by earlier investigators, as well as emission peak altitudes based on simultaneous ionospheric sounding observations. The average maximum and minimum zonal plasma drift velocities inferred for both the emissions, using emission peak altitudes based on simultaneous ionospheric observations, (OI 630.0 nm: 172 ± 2 and 89 ± 15 m/s; OI 777.4 nm: 184 ± 12 and 103 ± 16 m/s) are lower and with less scatter than those using fixed emission peak altitudes (OI 630.0 nm: 185 ± 10 and 104 ± 18 m/s; OI 777.4 nm: 202 ± 19 and 121 ± 20 m/s). Also, the nocturnal variations of the zonal plasma drift velocities obtained for the two emissions with peak altitudes based on simultaneous ionospheric observations show better agreement than for the case with fixed emission peak altitudes (h = 380 km for OI 777.4 nm and h = 300 km for OI 630.0 nm).

In a human study of the cardiovascular effects of air pollution, we aimed to evaluate the potential association between air pollution levels and the fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), a non-invasive measure of airway inflammation. Methods: Breath samples were collected weekly between September and December 2000 in a community based group of elderly subjects (median age 70.7 years) in Steubenville, Ohio. The samples were analysed for NO. Air pollution levels were measured concurrently at a central site monitor. Results: An increase in the 24 hour average PM 2.5 concentration of 17.7 μg/m3 was associated with an increase in FENO of 1.45 ppb (95% Cl 0.33 to 2.57) in models adjusted for subject, week of study, day of the week, hour of the day, ambient barometric pressure, temperature, and relative humidity. This represents a change of approximately 15% compared with the mean FENO in the cohort (9.9 ppb). A significant association was also observed for a 24 hour moving average of ambient NO (0.83 ppb increase, 95% Cl 0.26 to 1.40). In two-pollutant models, the magnitude and precision of the PM2.5 effect was not reduced and the ambient NO effect was no longer significant. The associations between FENO and PM2.5 were significantly higher in subjects with a doctor's diagnosis of COPD (p value for interaction = 0.03). Conclusions: Ambient pollution may lead to airway inflammation as measured by FENO. These subclinical inflammatory changes may be an important step in the pathogenesis of the cardiopulmonary effects induced by exposure to air pollution.",,"nitric oxide; accuracy; adult; aged; air pollution; air temperature; airway; ambient air; article; association; atmospheric pressure; biological monitoring; breath analysis; chronic obstructive lung disease; cohort analysis; community; comparative study; concentration response; controlled study; correlation analysis; environmental exposure; exhalation; experimental model; female; fractionation; human; humidity; inflammation; male; measurement; normal human; priority journal; reduction; sampling; statistical significance; Aged; Air Pollutants; Asthma; Breath Tests; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cohort Studies; Humans; Nitric Oxide; Ohio; Pulmonary Disease, Chronic Obstructive",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542405174

The Environmental Performance Indicators are made up of the Management Performance Indicators and the Operational Performance Indicators (OPI). Many oil and gas companies have identified major OPI which are measured periodically. OPI data of the same type, but from different sources, are often aggregated. However, it has not been possible to aggregate OPI data of different types, units and sources into a unified measurement that can be used for environmental performance evaluation and monitoring. It has been difficult to decide if the environmental performance is better with a reduction of greenhouse gasses emissions or an increase in water quality. This paper develops a fuzzy model that captures the total impact of different OPI with different units and from different sources. OPI such as Carbon Dioxide Emissions per Capita, Arable Land Area, BOD in Water, Concentration of Faecal Coliforms, the Nickel Vanadium Ratio and the Generation of Industrial/Municipal Waste are used as input variables into the fuzzy model. Membership functions are derived for these input variables and fuzzy rules are used to generate an output variable. The output variable is a General Environmental Operational Performance Index (GEOPI). The GEOPI allows the overall environmental performance to be measured and monitored. Finally, it allows the total impact of alternative targets, remedial actions and programs to be optimized in the face of limited funds and budgetary constraints.",,"Carbon dioxide; Crude petroleum; Decision making; Environmental impact; Fuzzy control; Fuzzy sets; Gas emissions; Mathematical models; Natural gas; Optimization; Potable water; Sustainable development; Emission reduction; Fuzzy models; Operational performance indicators (OPI); Petroleum industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942589030

Plants were grown under ambient (350 ppm) or elevated (700 ppm) CO2 levels, and were either damaged or undamaged by Spodoptera littoralis larvae. At harvest, growth of undamaged (control) plants was determined, and foliar chemical composition of both undamaged and damaged plants was analyzed. Cotton grew faster overall and showed a greater increase in growth in response to CO2 enrichment than did alfalfa. Elevated CO2 levels increased starch and decreased nitrogen levels in damaged alfalfa and undamaged cotton plants. Alfalfa saponin levels were significantly increased by elevated CO2 and damage. Regarding specific saponins, medicagenic acid bidesmoside (3GlcA,28AraRhaXyl medicagenate) concentrations were reduced by high CO2, whereas zanhic acid tridesmoside (3GlcGlcGlc,23Ara, 28AraRhaXylApi Za) levels were unaffected by the treatments.

In cotton, herbivore damage increased levels of total terpenoid aldehydes, gossypol, hemigossypolone, the heliocides H1 and H4, but not H2 and H3, whereas CO2 enrichment had no effect.

The application studied here is the operation of a solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) with both direct (DIR) and indirect (IIR) internal reforming of methane. Such internal reforming within a high-temperature fuel cell module can lead to an overall autothermal operation which simplifies the system design and increases efficiency. However, such coupling is not easy to achieve because of the mismatch between the thermal load associated with the rate of steam reforming at typical SOFC temperatures and the local amount of heat available from the fuel cell reactions. Previous results have shown that the use of typical metal-based (e.g. Ni) IIR catalysts leads to full methane consumption but undesirable local cooling at the reformer entrance and the use of less active IIR catalysts (e.g. non-metals or diffusion limited nickel) leads to methane being carried-over into the SOFC anode (methane slippage). In order to evaluate performance in the latter case, a combined DIR and IIR SOFC steady-state model has been developed. Simulation results have shown that, lowering the IIR catalyst activity to prevent local cooling effects at the reformer entrance is not adequate, as the fast kinetics of the direct reforming reaction then lead to full methane conversion and steep temperature gradients in the first 10% of the fuel channel length. It is shown that the simultaneous reduction of the anode DIR reaction rate improves performance considerably. The system behaviour towards changes in current density, operating pressure, and flow configuration (counter-flow vs. co-flow) has been studied. Reduction of both DIR and IIR catalyst activity combined with a counter-flow operation leads to the best performance. System performance with an IIR oxide-based catalyst is also evaluated. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The POU water filtration system that contained the nutshell-based carbons was designated 'Envirofilter' and adsorption efficiencies of this system were compared to that of four commercially available POU home water filter systems, namely, BRITA, Omni Filter, PUR and Teledyne Water Pik. Eight different 'Envirofilters' were constructed of individual or binary mixtures of carbons produced from acid-activated almond or pecan shells and steam-activated pecan or walnut shells and evaluated for adsorption of the three chlorination by-products. The results indicate that only two of the eight 'Envirofilters' failed to remove more THMs than the commercial POU systems. In both cases, these filters contained carbons with either 100% acid-activated almond shells or 100% acid-activated pecan shells. All six of the other filters contained carbons with either 50% or 100% steam-activated pecan shells or steam-activated walnut shells. Therefore, 'Envirofilters' appeared to depend on the presence of steam-activated nutshell carbons for their success. The six effective 'Envirofilters' reduced THM levels to below the Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCL) required by the US Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). Based on these results, these six 'Envirofilters' may be considered as a replacement for existing commercial filter systems because of their efficacy and projected cost. © 2004 Society of Chemical Industry.","Bromodichloromethane; Bromoform; Dibromochloromethane; Granular activated carbon; Nutshells; Point-of-use water filter","Contamination; Environmental protection; Potable water; Water filtration; Water supply; Envirofilters; Maximum Contaminant Levels (MCL); Point-of-use (POU) water filteration system; Water filters; Chlorination; activated carbon; bromoform; carbon; carcinogen; dibromochloromethane; drinking water; phosphoric acid; trihalomethane; activated carbon; dechlorination; drinking water; filter; adsorption; almond; article; biofilter; biofiltration; chlorination; controlled study; cost; intermethod comparison; pecan; United States; walnut; waste component removal; water treatment; Carya illinoinensis; Juglans; Juglans regia; Prunus dulcis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5044230478

The EURO-3 emission regulation will be enforced in Europe beginning in year 2006. Compared to the EURO-2 regulation, reduction of cold-start HC and reduction of NOx from the extra-urban driving cycle are the main issues for EURO-3 compliance. The hydrocarbon reduction during cold-starting was achieved by the method of early catalyst activation using a combination of an Idle Air Control Valve system (IACV), ignition-retard, and atomization of fuel spray. In the extra-urban driving cycle, the fine controlled air-fuel ratio reduced. In addition, optimization of the number of three-way catalyst cells and their capacity also reduced NOx. Moreover, power loss decline caused by increased exhaust resistance due to increasing the catalyst size was avoided by optimizing the catalyst location. These techniques have maintained power and drivability while complying to the EURO-3 regulation. © 2004 Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc.",,"Catalysts; Engine cylinders; Motorcycles; Nitrogen oxides; Starting; Air control valves; Air fuel ratios; Catalyst activation; Control techniques; Emission reduction; Emission regulation; Three way catalysts; Urban driving cycles; Emission control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881212897

The Cedars Emory quantitative analysis program (CEqual) was used to quantify the size of perfusion defects and the Cedars-Sinai quantitative gated single-photon emission tomography program was used to quantify left ventricular function. Five patients with reversible apical defects, five with fixed apical defects and three patients with normal perfusion were selected. Eight experienced medical laboratory technologists processed the studies from raw projection data. The manual steps consisted of defining two alignment axes parallel to the long axis of the left ventricle, and for the CEqual program selecting apex and base in the short axis slices in the rest and stress studies. Wide variability between the operators in the quantification of reversibility could be seen in all three vascular territories. A range > 10% was found in at least one vascular territory for nine of the 13 patients. The differences in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) between operators were < 5% for all 13 patients. The large variability in the quantification of reversible apical perfusion defects may influence the clinical interpretation and cause false conclusions.

This site dependency of CO2 sequestration makes its evaluation difficult. In order to evaluate the cost effectiveness of CO2 sequestration in parallel with other carbon mitigation options in Japan, a new mathematical model of optimization type has been developed. The energy systems and the processes of CO2 recovery, transportation and sequestration are modeled in the bottom-up fashion. To pay due consideration to the site dependency, the land area of Japan is divided into 20 regions and the offshore area also into 20 regions. The land regions have various kinds of energy supply-side facilities and CO2 recovery and transportation facilities. The final energy demand is grouped into four types of energy: solid fuel, gaseous fuel, liquid fuel and electricity. On the other hand, the offshore regions have aquifers for CO2 sequestration. In addition, CO2 sequestration into ocean is taken into account. These model regions are inter-linked with each other, and inter-regional CO2 transportation and energy transportation are considered. The total cost of energy systems and CO2 sequestration in Japan between the years 2000 and 2050 is minimized in this model. This paper describes the structure of this new model for evaluation of CO2 sequestration in Japan, and presents model-based optimization solutions as to when, where and how much CO2 sequestration and other carbon mitigation options should be implemented under assumed carbon mitigation policy options. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

These reactions are dependent on the number of reactive sites on the soot surface rather than the soot surface area per se. A box model, MOCCA, is used to investigate the effects of introducing heterogeneous reactions on soot into an air parcel passing over an urban area and traveling downwind. The model was run at two soot mass concentrations of 2 μg/m3 and 20 μg/m3 with a surface density of n-hexane and decane. Signifcant change in gas-phase concentration was only observed for the higher soot concentration. Due to the noncatalytic nature of the heterogeneous reactions, soot sites are rapidly consumed, and soot site concentrations are greatly reduced shortly after emissions are turned off. Notable changes in gaseous concentrations due to the introduction of heterogeneous reactions are not observed in the urban setting. The impact of heterogeneous reactions is more evident after emissions are turned off (i.e. downwind from the urban center). These changes are minimal for the condition that used n-hexane surface density. For conditions that used decane soot, NOx concentrations showed a slight increase, with NO being higher in the day time and NO2 at night. The maximum O3 reduction observed when using the higher soot concentration is 7 ppb, downwind of the urban center. Change in O3 concentration was less than 1 ppb when using the lower soot loading.

In this work, the effects of fuel reformulation, oxidation catalyst, engine type, and engine operation parameters on diesel particle emission characteristics were investigated. Particle emissions from an indirect injection (IDI) and a direct. injection (DI) engine car operating under steady-state conditions with a reformulated low-sulfur, low-aromatic fuel and a standard-grade fuel were analyzed. Organic (OC) and elemental (EC) carbon fractions of the particles were quantified by a thermal-optical transmission analysis method and particle size distributions measured with a scanning mobility particle sizer(SMPS). The particle volatility characteristics were studied with a configuration that consisted of a thermal desorption unit and an SMPS. In addition, the volatility of size-selected particles was determined with a tandem differential mobility analyzer technique. The reformulated fuel was found to produce 10-40% less particulate carbon mass compared to the. standard fuel. On the basis of the carbon analysis, the organic carbon contributed 27-61% to the carbon mass of the IDI engine particle emissions, depending on the fuel and engine operation parameters. The fuel reformulation reduced the particulate organic carbon emissions by 10-55%. In the particles of the DI engine, the organic carbon contributed 14-26% to the total carbon emissions, the advanced engine technology, and the oxidation catalyst, thus reducing the OC/EC ratio of particles considerably.

Methods: This study was conducted in Irbid District, in northern Jordan, a region located 31 degrees north of the equator, with a stable, subtropical climate. In this case control study, 96 adult subjects presenting with pterygium were interviewed and compared to 192 control subjects who were group-matched for age and sex. A standard questionnaire and eye examination were completed for both groups. Results: There was a strong positive association between pterygium and environmental factors. The most striking increase in the risk of pterygium occurred in subjects who worked outdoors compared to those who worked indoors, with an odds ratio of 5.47. Current and previous sunlight exposures were associated with a higher risk of developing pterygium, with odds ratios of 3.54 and 4.52, respectively. Previous use of sunglasses represented a protective element, but the protective role of recent use of sunglasses was not statistically significant. Conclusion: There is a statistically significant association between outdoor work, sunlight exposure and pterygium formation. Efforts should be made to educate outdoor workers to wear sunglasses and brimmed hats. Public education should focus on avoidance of unnecessary sunlight exposure.","Jordan; Pterygium; Sunglasses; Sunlight exposure","adult; aged; article; confidence interval; controlled study; environmental factor; female; high risk population; human; interview; Jordan; major clinical study; male; population research; priority journal; pterygium; questionnaire; risk assessment; risk factor; statistical analysis; statistical significance; sun exposure; sunlight; Adult; Aged; Environment; Eye Protective Devices; Female; Humans; Jordan; Male; Middle Aged; Occupational Exposure; Pterygium; Questionnaires; Risk Factors; Sunlight",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242342898

The result of those simulations are compared to station data. REMO simulations were performed at 0.5° horizontal resolution for the whole archipelago and at 1/6° for Sulawesi Island. In general the REMO model, reproduces the spatial pattern of monthly and seasonal rainfall well over land, but overestimates the rainfall over sea. Superiority of REMO performance over land is due to a high-resolution orography, while over sea, REMO suffers from erroneously low surface fluxes. REMO reproduces variability during El Niño-Southern Oscillations years well but fails to show a good (wet and dry) monsoon contrast. Despite strong influences of the lateral boundary fields, REMO shows a realistic improvement of a local phenomenon over Molucca. Significant improvement for the step from the relatively high global 1.125° to 0.5° resolution is noticeable, but not from 0.5° into 1/6°. The REMO simulation driven by ERA15 has the best quality, followed by NRA and ECHAM4 driven simulations. The quality of ERA 15 is the main factor determining the quality of REMO simulations. A predictability study shows small internal variability among ensemble members. However, there are systematic intrinsic climatological errors as shown in the predictability analysis. These intrinsic errors have monthly, seasonal and regional dependencies and the one over Java is significantly large. The intrinsic error study suggests the presence of the spring predictability barrier and a high level of predictability in summer. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"climate modeling; climate prediction; error analysis; rainfall; regional climate; spatial variation; Asia; Eurasia; Indonesia; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843058211

Fire is often associated with episodes of air pollution, possibly involving the release of biogenic isoprenoids (isoprene and monoterpenes). The direct and indirect impacts of fire on isoprenoid emission by plants of the Mediterranean vegetation were studied. Leaves of Arbutus unedo, Phillyrea latifolia, Cistus incanus, Cistus mospeliensis, Pistacia lentiscus, Quercus ilex, Quercus suber, Quercus pubescens, Myrtus communis and Pinus halepensis were exposed to direct fire or to the fire-consequent wave of elevated temperature. 2. Half the tested plant species did not emit isoprenoids and the treatments did not induce isoprenoid emission. In contrast, isoprene was emitted by intact leaves of Q. pubescens and M. communis, while monoterpenes were emitted by intact leaves of Q. ilex, Q. suber and P. halepensis. 3. The two treatments rapidly reduced isoprene emission by isoprene-emitting species and monoterpene emission by Quercus spp. This inhibition was associated with photosynthetic inhibition, and recovery was seen in Quercus spp. within days of treatment. Recovery was also associated with the recovery of photosynthesis, suggesting that emitted isoprenoids continue to be formed predominantly from photosynthetic intermediates after a fire episode. 4. In Q. pubescens leaves, however, recovery from the elevated-temperature treatment caused a sustained increase of isoprene emission which was not mirrored by a similar increase in photosynthesis. Whether this represents the induction of alternative metabolic pathways or an increase of the flux of photosynthetic carbon in the isoprene pathway is not known. Isoprene-emitting species in areas surrounding fire may emit a substantially larger hydrocarbon flux for several days after fire. 5. The elevated-temperature treatment induced the emission of α-pinene from Myrtus leaves, and the fire treatment stimulated the emission of several monoterpenes from Pinus needles. The emission began to decrease within minutes in Myrtus, while it increased within the first 100 min in Pinus, where it was detectable the day after the event although the flux was smaller than in prestressed needles. 6. Exposure to fire and to the associated elevated temperature may induce bursts of monoterpenes from plants that regularly do not emit these compounds and temporarily increase the load of monoterpenes in the atmosphere by pine species. These emissions may contribute to photochemical reactions involved in smog and ozone formation.","Fire ecology; Isoprene; Mediterranean plant species; Monoterpenes; Ozone; Photosynthesis; Stomatal conductance","atmospheric pollution; emission; fire; isoprenoid; ozone; smog; Mediterranean Region; Mediterranean Sea; Arbutus; Arbutus unedo; Cistus; Cistus incanus; Ilex; Myrtus communis; Phillyrea; Phillyrea latifolia; Pinus halepensis; Pistacia; Pistacia lentiscus; Quercus; Quercus ilex; Quercus pubescens; Quercus suber",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942614920

The combination of these two models has led to a physically explicit Dust Production Model (DPM). In this work, sensitivity tests are performed with the DPM to determine the nature of the main soil parameters that control dust emissions by sandblasting. It is found that the soil roughness length and the dry size distribution of the soil aggregates constituting the loose wind erodible fraction of the topsoil have the greatest influence on the soil potential for mineral dust production.

Results show (1) that for the tested soils the DPM, and hence sandblasting, explain all dust emissions, and (2) that 13 of the 14 soils that had been selected a priori for their high potential for dust emissions contained a fine soil-aggregate component. This is consistent with the sensitivity tests indicating that the presence of such a component could enhance dust emissions by one order of magnitude. Finally, it can be concluded that most of the apparent scatter in the experimental results was in large part due to an inappropriate choice of soil parameters to interpret them. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The area of planted pine has increased more than 10-fold since 1950, mostly on private lands. Private landowners have responded to market incentives and government programs, including subsidized afforestation on marginal agricultural land. Timber harvest is a crucial disturbance affecting planted pine area, as other forest types are converted to planted pine after harvest. Conversely, however, many harvested pine plantations revert to other forest types, mainly due to passive regeneration behavior on nonindustrial private timberlands. We model land use and land cover changes as a basis for projecting future changes in planted pine area, to aid policy analysts concerned with mitigation activities for global climate change. Projections are prepared in two stages. Projected land use changes include deforestation due to pressures to develop rural land as the human population expands, which is a larger area than that converted from other rural lands (e.g., agriculture) to forestry. In the second stage, transitions among forest types are projected on land allocated to forestry. We consider reforestation, influences of timber harvest, and natural succession and disturbance processes. Baseline projections indicate a net increase of about 5.6 million ha in planted pine area in the South over the next 50 years, with a notable increase in sequestered carbon. Additional opportunities to expand pine plantation area warrant study of landowner behavior to aid in designing more effective incentives for inducing land use and land cover changes to help mitigate climate change and attain other goals.","Baseline; Carbon sequestration; Forest cover type; Mitigation","Carbon; Forestry; Land use; Marketing; Reforestation; Afforestation; Carbon analyses; Plantations; Environmental engineering; carbon; carbon sequestration; forest management; forestry; land cover; land use change; timber harvesting; agriculture; carbon sequestration; climate change; conference paper; deforestation; forest; geographic distribution; global climate; human; land use; nonhuman; pine; policy; United States; North America; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042742145

One AMS was modified to allow the study of sea salt-based particles, while the other used a temperature cycling system on its. inlet. The reported loadings increased by a factor of 2 when the temperature approached the dew point, which is due to the inlet performance and has implications for other AMS experiments and applications. The processed data were compared with those of a particle into liquid sampler-ion chromatograph and showed that the ammonium, sulfate and organic fractions of the particles were consistently found within a single, normally acidic, accumulation mode at around 300-400 nm. However, when influenced by land-based sources, vehicle emissions and increased ammonium loadings were seen. The concentrations of nitrate in the accumulation mode were low, but it was also found within sea salt particles in the coarse mode and can be linked to the displacement of chloride. The organic fraction showed a high degree of chemical ageing and evidence of nitrogenbearing organics was also observed. The particulate organic data were compared to the volatile organic carbon data derived from an in-situ gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer-flame ionization detector and relationships were found between the gas and particle phase chemicals in both the overall concentrations and the levels of oxidatoin.

The responses from surveys of local authorities in England and Wales carried out in 2000 (IDeA, Reducing Greenhouse Gas Emissions: survey of activities and initiatives by local authorities. (Questionnaire and results) Improvement and Development Agency, 2000) and 2002 (Allman et al., Climate Change: a survey of local authorities, Local Government Association, 2002) were compared. Progress in implementing the International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) five-step methodology (ICLEI, Local Government Implementation of Climate Protection-report to the United Nations, International Council for Local Environmental Initiatives, 1997) was used to identify the 'successful' local authorities. The barriers faced by these authorities were then compared with those faced by the remaining local authorities. Most local authorities are not making substantial progress. However, a small number have successfully prepared greenhouse gas emissions inventories, developed strategies and implemented adaptation and greenhouse gas reduction measures. These successful authorities have made progress despite the fact that addressing climate change is not a legal requirement. Their success is due to three key factors. Firstly, they have recognised the secondary benefits of tackling climate change, e.g. potential employment, improved quality of life and reduction in fuel poverty. Secondly, they have the strong political, professional and technical support necessary to champion climate change activities. Finally, they have worked in partnership with utilities, private, public and voluntary groups to raise the finance needed to implement measures both to adapt to climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,"climate change; emission control; environmental policy; greenhouse gas; local government; England; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Wales; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642530242

The survey results indicate that despite the successful reduction of certain pollutants, the vast majority of Canadian and United States scientists believe that acid rain pollution continues to adversely affect lakes and streams and that present emissions targets are not protecting sensitive ecosystems. Furthermore, the survey results show that scientists from both countries view the acid rain issue from similar perspectives, and that national sympathies do not play a decisive role in scientists’ perceptions of the acid rain issue.

Density-driven flow of CO2 led to significantly greater spreading of the plume and greater storage of CO2 within the vadose zone than if density contrasts were not accounted for.

To determine which bicarbonate transporters are responsible for this activity, we measured the expression levels of all known HCO3--anion exchange proteins in mouse heart, by quantitative real time RT-PCR. Bicarbonate-anion exchangers are members of either the SLC4A or the SLC26A gene families. In neonatal and adult myocardium, AE1 (Slc4a1), AE2 (Slc4a2), AE3 (Slc4a3) (AE3fl and AE3c variants), Slc26a3 and Slc26a6 were expressed. Adult hearts expressed Slc26a3 and Slc4a1-3 mRNAs, at similar levels, while Slc26a6 mRNA was about seven-fold higher than AE3, which was more abundant than any other. Immunohistochemistry revealed that Slc26a6 and AE3 are present in the plasma membrane of ventricular myocytes. Slc26a6 expression levels were higher in ventricle than atrium, whereas AE3 was detected only in ventricle. Cl--HCO3- and Cl--OH- exchange activity of SLC26A6 and AE3 were investigated in transfected HEK293 cells, using intracellular fluorescence measurements of 2′,7′-bis (2-carboxyethyl)-5(6 -carboxyfluorescein (BCECF), to monitor intracellular pH (pHi). Rates of pHi change were measured under HCO3--containing (Cl--HCO3-) or nominally HCO3--free (Cl--OH-) conditions. HCO3- fluxes were similar for cells expressing AE3fl, SLC26A6 or Slc26a3, suggesting that they have similar transport activity. However, only SLC26A6 and Slc26a3 functioned as Cl--OH- exchangers. Activation of α-adrenergic receptors, which stimulates protein kinase C, inhibited SLC26A6 Cl--HCO3- exchange activity. We conclude that Slc26a6 is the predominant Cl--HCO3- and Cl--OH- exchanger of the myocardium and that Slc26a6 is negatively regulated upon α-adrenergic stimulation. © The Physiological Society 2004.",,"2,7 bis(carboxyethyl) 6 carboxyfluorescein; alpha adrenergic receptor; antiporter; bicarbonate; bicarbonate chloride antiporter; chloride ion; hydroxyl chloride antiporter; hydroxyl group; messenger RNA; protein kinase C; unclassified drug; bicarbonate; carrier proteins and binding proteins; protein SLC26A3; protein SLC26A6; protein SLC4A1; protein SLC4A2; protein SLC4A3; animal cell; anion transport; article; cell membrane; cell pH; cell strain HEK293; controlled study; enzyme activation; fluorescence; gene expression; genetic transfection; heart; heart atrium; heart ventricle wall; human; human cell; immunohistochemistry; mouse; multigene family; muscle cell; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; pH measurement; priority journal; protein expression; receptor down regulation; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; adult; alpha adrenergic stimulation; Article; heart; immunocytochemistry; newborn; protein localization; quantitative analysis; real time polymerase chain reaction; Slc26a3 gene; Slc26a6 gene; Slc4a1 gene; Slc4a2 gene; Slc4a3 gene; Animals; Antiporters; Bicarbonates; Cell Line; Chloride-Bicarbonate Antiporters; Gene Expression Regulation; Heart; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hydroxides; Mice; Phenylephrine; Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-1; RNA, Messenger; Transfection",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11344282403

Cadillac Brook watershed, which burned in 1947, has thin soils and predominantly deciduous vegetation. It was compared to the unburned Hadlock Brook watershed, with thicker soil and predominantly coniferous vegetation. Soils in both watersheds were primarily well drained. The fire had a significant impact on the Cadillac watershed, by raising the soil pH, altering the vegetation, and reducing carbon and Hg pools. Total Hg content was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) in Hadlock soils (0.18 kg Hg ha-1) compared to Cadillac soils (0. 13 kg Hg ha-1). Hadlock O horizon had an average Hg concentration of 134±48 ng Hg g-1 dry weight, compared to 103±23 ng Hg g-1 dry weight in Cadillac O horizon. Soil pH was significantly higher in all soil horizons at Cadillac compared to Hadlock soils. This difference was especially significant in the O horizon, where Cadillac soils had an average pH of 3.41±0.22 compared to Hadlock soils with an average pH of 2.99±0.13. To study the mobilization potential of Hg in the O horizons of the two watersheds, batch adsorption experiments were conducted, and the results were modeled using surface complexation modeling. The results of Hg adsorption experiments indicated that the dissolved Hg concentration was controlled by the dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration. The adsorption isotherms suggest that Hg is more mobile in the O horizon of the unburned Hadlock watershed because of higher solubility of organic carbon resulting in higher DOC concentrations in that watershed. Methylmercury concentrations, however, were consistently higher in the burned Cadillac O horizon (0.20±0.13 ng Hg g-1 dry weight) than in the unburned Hadlock O horizon (0.07±0.07 ng Hg g-1 dry weight). Similarly, Cadillac soils possessed a higher MeHg content (0.30 g MeHg ha-1) than Hadlock soils (0.16 g MeHg ha-1). The higher MeHg concentrations in Cadillac soils may reflect generally faster rates of microbial metabolism due to more rapid nutrient cycling and higher soil pH in the deciduous forest. In this research, we have shown that the amount of MeHg is not a function of the total pool of Hg in the watershed. Indeed, MeHg was inversely proportional to total Hg, suggesting that landscape factors such as soil pH, vegetation type, or land use history (e.g., fire) may be the determining factors for susceptibility to high Hg in biota. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publisher.

The chromium oxide was reduced to chromium carbide Cr3C2 with a degree of reduction close to 100 pct The rate of reduction increased with temperature and methane content in the reducing gas. Carbon monoxide, added to the reducing gas, strongly retarded the rate of Cr2O3 reduction. The hydrogen content had a slight effect on the reduction rate. High extent and rate of reduction by methane-containing gas in comparison with carbothermal reduction were attributed to high carbon activity in the reducing gas - 15 to 50 (relative to graphite).",,"Carbon monoxide; Chemical reactors; Composition; Iron oxides; Methane; Mixtures; Reduction; Scanning electron microscopy; Thermal effects; X ray diffraction analysis; Carbothermal reduction; Chromium oxide; Solid-state reduction; Chromium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544225001

At pyrene concentrations lower than 10 mM, the intensity of excimer fluorescence is proportional to the concentration and at higher concentrations it deviates from this trend due to concentration quenching. Thermal aging studies show that this concentration quenching can be removed by thermal annealing and the excimer emission intensity approaches the value expected from the trend at lower concentrations. The diffusion coefficient of pyrene at low concentrations in silicone polymer coatings is obtained using the approximate solution of one-dimensional diffusion equation. A modified approach is employed to estimate the diffusion coefficient at higher pyrene concentrations. In this method, the excimer intensity and time scale are shifted, respectively to Imax the maximum value of excimer intensity attained during annealing and tmax, the time taken to reach this. The estimated diffusion coefficients at different pyrene concentrations show a negligible dependence on pyrene concentration in both types of polymers. These results are attributed to the high structural mobility of silicone polymer chains due to their molecular structure. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Concentrations of secondary aerosol species such as particulate NO-3, NH+4, SO2-4, and SOC (secondary organic carbon) were calculated for the particle size below 2.5 μm and compared with the data available from a field experiment, which took place in May-June 1998. Model results for the inorganic aerosols were comparable to the measurements at an urban and a rural station. Sensitivity studies with reduced anthropogenic NOx and volatile organic carbon (VOC) emissions showed that SOC behaves in the same way as ozone, i.e., decreases with reduced VOC emissions and increases with reduced NOx emissions in the plume where ozone production is predicted to be VOC sensitive. Sensitivity of secondary aerosol formation to NH3 and NOx emissions was studied by reducing these emissions. Varying NH3 emissions led to an almost linear change in secondary aerosol mass at sites with low NH3. At ammonia-rich sites, on the other hand, availability of nitrate became important for the further formation o of secondary aerosols. Monoterpene emissions were predicted to contribute about 25% of the secondary organic aerosols produced in the northern part of the model domain, which is mostly a forested area.

This hydrological change, as with the change in climate variables, will vary regionally around the globe. Impact studies at local and regional scales are needed to assess how different regions will be affected. This study focuses on assessment of hydrological impacts of climate change over a wide range of Swedish basins. Different methods of transferring the signal of climate change from climate models to hydrological models were used. Several hydrological model simulations using regional climate model scenarios from Swedish Regional Climate Modelling Programme (SWECLIM) are presented. A principal conclusion is that subregional impacts to river flow vary considerably according to whether a basin is in northern or southern Sweden. Furthermore, projected hydrological change is just as dependent on the choice of the global climate model used for regional climate model boundary conditions as the choice of anthropogenic emissions scenario.",,"climate change; climate modeling; hydrological change; river flow; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042555626

The Letter to the Parties does not limit the emissions to be considered to be only greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Thus, in this paper we explore the importance of anthropogenic SO x emissions that are converted to sulfate aerosol in the atmosphere, together with the cumulative greenhouse gas emissions, in attributing historical temperature change. We use historical emissions and our simple climate model to estimate the relative contributions to global warming of the regional emissions by four Parties: OECD90, Africa and Latin America, Asia, and Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union. Our results show that for most Parties the large warming contributed by their GHG emissions is largely offset by the correspondingly large cooling by their SO x emissions. Thus, OECD90 has become the dominant contributor to recent global warming following its large reduction in SO x emissions after 1980.","global warming; greenhouse gases; regional emissions; sulfate aerosol","climate change; emission control; international agreement; Kyoto Protocol; sulfur emission",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444362135

The sensitivity of the results to the horizontal resolution jump and updating frequency of the lateral boundary conditions are also evaluated. In order to accomplish this, a perfect-model approach nicknamed the Big-Brother Experiment (BBE) was followed. The experimental protocol consists of first establishing a virtual-reality reference climate over a fairly large area by using the Canadian RCM with grid spacing of 45 km nested within NCEP analyses. The resolution of the simulated climate is then degraded to resemble that of operational general circulation models (GCM) or observation analyses by removing small scales; the filtered fields are then used to drive the same regional model, but over a smaller sub-area. This set-up permits a comparison between two simulations of the same RCM over a common region. The Big-Brother Experiment has been carried out for four winter months over the west coast of North America. The results show that complex topography and coastline have a strong positive impact on the downscaling ability of the one-way nesting technique. These surface forcings, found to be responsible for a large part of small-scale climate features, act primarily locally and yield good climate reproducibility. Precipitation over the Rocky Mountains region is a field in which such effect is found and for which the nesting technique displays significant downscaling ability. The best downscaling ability is obtained when the ratio of spatial resolution between the nested model and the nesting fields is less than 12, and when the update frequency is more than twice a day. Decreasing the spatial resolution jump from a ratio of 12 to six has more benefits on the climate reproducibility than a reduction of spatial resolution jump from two to one. Also, it is found that an update frequency of four times a day leads to a better downscaling than twice a day when a ratio of spatial resolution of one is used. On the other hand, no improvement was found by using high-temporal resolution when the driving fields were degraded in terms of spatial resolution. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"climate modeling; complex terrain; downscaling; model test; resolution; North America; Western Hemisphere; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7744238304

The fluorescence measurements were conducted on polymer films of different thicknesses on platinum electrodes. Absorption spectra were also recorded, using PANI films on semitransparent gold electrodes. The fluorescence emission intensity, in the reduced state as a function of polymer film thickness (measured through the voltammetric charge) shows a complex behaviour. For low thicknesses, none or minimum emission is observed; this is attributed to the metallic quenching of the fluorescence. Beyond a critical thickness, the emission increases sharply, then reaches a maximum and finally decays slightly towards a limiting value. The decay is interpreted as due to the attenuation of the waves reflected on the metal surface: both the excitation wave absorbed after being reflected, and the emitted one reaching the detector after reflection are exponentially attenuated as the film thickness increases. In the case of PMOA, a polymer that, depending on the synthesis conditions, shows either conducting or non-conducting (redox) behaviour, the conducting form has a fluorescence response similar to that of PANI, whereas the non-conducting form shows low emission. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The 13CO and C18O data support the idea that gradual dissipation of the internal turbulence leads to formation of denser cores and subsequent star formation. There is no apparent relationship between the CS abundance and the CO temperature. The ratios of LIR to M LTE vary by no more than a factor of 3 for the CS cores and by nearly 1 order of magnitude for the 13CO cores.

It describes a method to calculate the total mileage driven around the city using the concept of mileage per zone. Although the methodology employs a classical approach through the use of emission factors developed for mean speeds, it also discusses the possibility of applying these factors to instantaneous speeds. Finally, the study focuses on the influence of two critical factors: time resolution and the estimate of the total mileage. In both cases, the results indicate that the assumptions made are adequate and yield accurate results. The methodology has been applied to the city of Madrid as an example. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

There are other positive features that could be used to enhance analyses and to prepare information in support of decision-making. These include: visualization of analysis results, improved communication with decision-makers, new analytical tools for testing transport technology innovations and investigating travel behaviour. This paper reports the methodological framework that is required for analysing the emission implications of measures that are intended to reduce vehicle emissions in urban transportation. A case study of the National Capital Region (NCR) Canada is used for illustration purposes. The overall framework for urban transportation planning, including emissions estimation, is introduced. The role of GIS is highlighted in terms of enhancing the reliability of data. Methodologies are noted that serve as an interface between travel analysis and emissions estimation. An emissions calculator is described that enables the estimation of air quality pollutants and greenhouse gas emissions. Finally, results of selected scenarios are presented. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The samples have excellent preservation of textures and primary mineralogy and are archetypal or Group 1 kimberlite. Five kimberlite localities are identified as calcite-bearing based on the presence of high Sr-Ba calcite as phenocrysts, microphenocrysts and in segregations. Three kimberlite localities are identified as dolomite-bearing based on the presence of mixed calcite-dolomite segregations containing oscillatory and banded textures of calcite-dolomite solid solution and dolomite (±magnesite). Sr-Ba calcite are characterized by high X Ca (&gt;0.95) and are enriched in Sr (4900-11,100 ppm) and Ba (3200-14,200 ppm). The calcite-dolomite and dolomite-magnesite solid solution compositions span the X Ca range from 0.42 to 0.95, and typically have Sr and Ba contents in the range of 1000-4000 ppm. The carbonate, silicate and oxide mineral compositions suggest that the origin of the calcite-bearing versus dolomite-bearing kimberlites studied is related to subtle differences in parent magma composition, in particular, the CO2/H2O ratio. Formation of the carbonates reflects the latter part of a protracted magmatic crystallization sequence, in which Sr-Ba calcite precipitates from an evolved kimberlite melt. Subsequently, calcite-dolomite solid solution and dolomite is precipitated from localized, Mg-rich carbonate fluids at relatively high temperatures (higher than serpentine stability). © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The pH-dependent behaviour in water solution and the observed partial fragmentation of oxidised nanotubes, that can contribute in enhancing water solubility by shortening structures, are discussed. Prolonged heating of the material affords a higher graphitisation index of the functionalised carbonaceous watersoluble frameworks, and possible chemical paths for the partial recovering of pristine carbon nanostructures are reported. The achieved hydrophily due to polar oxygen moieties insertions on nanostructures provides a remarkable unprecedented water solubility for these carbon substrates without the attachment of large polar appendages.","Single-walled carbon nanotubes; Solid-state spectroscopy; Water solubility","Derivatives; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Scanning electron microscopy; Solubility; Water; X ray diffraction analysis; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Phase transfer catalysts; Single-walled carbon nanotubes; Solid-state spectroscopy; Water solubility; Carbon nanotubes",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10044242786

Conducted between 1992 and 2001, these measurements represent the longest and most complete record of VOC measurements available for Mexico City. Ambient air VOC samples were collected at surface air quality monitoring sites in electro-polished stainless-steel canisters, and analyzed by Gas Chromatography with Flame Ionization Detection for the C2 to C12 hydrocarbons and MTBE. This paper presents the total VOCs in morning measurements (06:00-09:00 AM) and its trend through time. Average concentrations of total VOCs in each campaign were between 3130 and 6711ppbC at Xalostoc (northeast of the city center), 2994 and 4935ppbC at La Merced (center), and 1136 and 2815ppbC at Pedregal (southwest). A linear regression of the total VOCs reveals a slight decreasing trend from 1992 to 2001 which is statistically significant only at Xalostoc; the decreasing trends at the two other sites are not statistically significant and therefore inconclusive. This apparent stabilization and possible decrease in ambient concentrations, despite the growth in the vehicular fleet and other activities during this period, suggests that VOC emission control measures have been effective at reducing emissions. Co-located measurements of CO and NOx from the Metropolitan Atmospheric Monitoring Automatic Network are used to calculate ratios of total VOCs/NOx and CO/NOx, in order to evaluate the official 1998 emissions inventory for the MCMA. The ambient ratios of VOCs/NOx and CO/NOx are found to be factors of 2-3 times higher than the corresponding inventory ratios. This discrepancy suggests that VOC and CO emissions may be significantly underestimated. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

However, our understanding of biogeochemical dynamics in pasturelands remains poor, especially when attempting to scale up predictions of C cycle changes. A wide range of pasture ages, soil types, management strategies, and climates make remote sensing the only realistic means to regionalize our understanding of pasture biogeochemistry and C cycling over such an enormous geographic area. However, the use of remote sensing has been impeded by a lack of effective links between variables that can be observed from satellites (e.g. live and senescent biomass) and variables that cannot be observed, but which may drive key changes in C storage and trace gas fluxes (e.g. soil nutrient status). We studied patterns in canopy biophysical-biochemical properties and soil biogeochemical processes along pasture age gradients on two important soil types in the central Amazon. Our goals were to (1) improve our understanding of the plot-scale biogeochemical dynamics of this land-use change, (2) evaluate the effects of pasture development on two contrasting soil types (clayey Oxisols and sandy Entisols), and (3) attempt to use remotely sensed variables to scale up the site-specific variability in biogeochemical conditions of pasturelands. The biogeochemical analyses showed that (1) aboveground and soil C stocks decreased with pasture age on both clayey and sandy soils, (2) declines in plant biomass were well correlated with declines in soil C and with available phosphorus (P) and calcium (Ca), and (3) despite low initial values for total and available soil P, ecosystem P stocks declined further with pasture age, as did a number of other nutrients. Spectral mixture analysis of Landsat imagery provided estimates of photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) that were highly correlated with field measurements of these variables and plant biomass. In turn, the remotely sensed sum PV + NPV was well correlated with the changes in soil organic carbon and nitrogen, and available P and Ca. These results suggest that remote sensing can be an excellent indicator of not only pasture area, but of pasture condition and C storage, thereby greatly improving regional estimates of the environmental consequences of such land-use change. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Amazon basin; Base cations; Brazil; Calcium; Deforestation; Land-use change; Nitrogen; Nutrient cycling; Pastures; Phosphorus; Tropical forest","carbon cycle; land use change; nutrient cycling; remote sensing; soil carbon; Amazon Basin; South America; Bos taurus; Nucleopolyhedrovirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642554825

We established chronosequences of large-area (14-158ha) selective logging sites spanning a 3.5-year period of forest regeneration and two distinct harvest methods: conventional logging (CL) and reduced-impact logging (RIL). Our goals were to: (1) determine the spatial characteristics of canopy gap fraction immediately following selective logging in the eastern Amazon; (2) determine the degree and rate of canopy closure in early years following harvest among the major landscape features associated with logging - tree falls, roads, skid trails and log decks; and (3) quantify spatial and temporal differences in canopy opening and closure in high- and low-damage harvests (CL vs. RIL). Across a wide range of harvest intensities (2.6-6.4 felled trees ha-1), the majority of ground damage occurred as skid trails (4-12%), whereas log decks and roads were only a small contributor to the total ground damage (&lt;2%). Despite similar timber harvest intensities, CL resulted in more ground damage than RIL. Neither the number of log decks nor their individual or total area was correlated with the number of trees removed or intensity of tree harvesting (trees ha-1). The area of skids was well correlated with the ground area damaged (m2) per tree felled. In recently logged forest (0.5 years postharvest), gap fractions were highest in log decks (mean RIL = 0.83, CL = 0.99) and lowest in tree-fall areas (RIL: 0.26, CL: 0.41). However, the small surface area of log decks made their contribution to the total area-integrated forest gap fraction minor. In contrast, tree falls accounted for more than two-thirds of the area disturbed, but the canopy gaps associated with felled trees were much smaller than for log decks, roads and skids. Canopy openings decreased in size with distance from each felled tree crown. At 0.5 years postharvest, the area initially affected by the felling of each tree was approximately 100 m in radius for CL and 50 m for RIL. Initial decreases in gap fraction during the first 1.5 years of regrowth diminished in subsequent years. Throughout the 3.5-year period of forest recovery, tree-fall gap fractions remained higher in CL than in RIL treatments, but canopy gap closure rates were higher in CL than in RIL areas. During the observed recovery period, the canopy gap area affected by harvesting decreased in radius around each felled tree from 100 to 40m in CL, and from 50 to 10 m in RIL. The results suggest that the full spatial and temporal dynamics of canopy gap fraction must be understood and monitored to predict the effects of selective logging on regional energy balance and climate regimes, biogeochemical processes including carbon cycling, and plant and faunal population dynamics. This paper also shows that remote sensing of log decks alone will not provide an accurate assessment of total forest area impacted by selective logging, nor will it be closely correlated to damage levels and canopy gap closure rates. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Amason basin; Brazil; Canopy damage; Carbon cycle; Forest recovery; Gap fraction; Selective logging; Tropical forest","canopy gap; forest management; gap dynamics; reforestation; selective logging; Amazon Basin; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642538554

Increasing average temperatures by 1.7°C observed over several seasons at Obregon, Mexico reduced the time to flowering by 11 days and resulted in a decline of total biomass and grain yield. These effects were reproduced by the model, except when the observed total biomass inexplicably rose again in the fourth and fifth year, despite higher temperature and a much shorter growing time. In a water stress experiment, the effects of different timing and duration of water deficit on crop growth and yield were reproduced with the model for a rain-shelter experiment at Lincoln, New Zealand where observed grain yields were reduced from 10 to 4tha -1 due to increased water deficit. In experiments from Western Australia, reduced growth and yields due to extreme terminal water deficit were also reproduced with the model where measured yields fall below 0.5tha -1. In the Maricopa Free Air Carbon-Dioxide Enrichment (FACE) experiment in Arizona, USA, the largest yield increase occurred with elevated CO2 in the dry and high N treatments, whereas little or no response was observed in the wet and low N supply treatments, as simulated with the model. Combining elevated CO2 with increased temperature in a sensitivity analysis, two levels of water supply and a range of N applications indicated a positive effect of elevated CO2 on yield as long as N was not limiting growth. Increased temperature and reduced water supply reduced yields and the yield response to N supply under ambient and elevated CO 2. Grain protein concentrations were reduced under elevated CO 2, but the difference was minor with ample N fertiliser. Evapotranspiration was reduced under elevated CO2. Higher temperatures increased evapotranspiration with low N input, but reduced it with ample N fertiliser, resulting in a reduction and an increase, respectively, in drainage below the root zone. In the Mediterranean environment of Western Australia the impact of elevated CO2 and increased temperature on grain yield was in average positive, but varied with seasonal rainfall distribution. Based on the range of model testing experiments and the sensitivity analysis, APSIM-Nwheat was found suitable for studies on directional impacts of future climate change on wheat production. Due to some large discrepancies between simulated and observed data, field experiments representing only a limited range of possible climate change scenarios and the large possible range of factorial interactions not tested, simulated quantitative effects with the model should be interpreted cautiously. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

It is demonstrated that in all cases, analyses which incorporate measurements of surface charge (cyclic voltammetry) together with local values of the pztc (nitrous oxide reduction) to evaluate overall total charge may provide excellent agreement with overall pztc data determined using CO charge displacement. This illustrates both the veracity and consistency of both methods of pztc determination. The previous analysis reported in [J. Electroanal. Chem. 532 (2002) 67] on stepped surfaces in the [11̄0] zone are here extended to stepped surfaces in the [011̄] zone, vicinal to the {100} plane. In contrast to the earlier study it is shown that the local pztc of step and terrace sites is independent of step density. For Bi adsorbed in step sites on Pt{332}, a shift to more positive values of the overall pztc relative to the clean surface is observed in agreement with predictions based on an earlier study [Electrochem. Commun. 3 (2001) 590]. The reason for this shift is discussed. Finally, the local pztc of Pd islands on Pt{100} is determined and used to calculate the variation in pztc as a function of Pd coverage. Again, good agreement with the pztc values extracted from CO displacement data is obtained. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This article proposes exposure-response functions for health effects of PM10 and SO2 pollution in China. The functions are based on Chinese epidemiological studies, and cover mortality, hospital admissions, and chronic respiratory symptoms and diseases. We derive the following coefficients for acute effects: a 0.03% (S.E. 0.01) and a 0.04% (S.E. 0.01) increase in all-cause mortality per μg/m3 PM 10 and SO2, respectively, a 0.04% (S.E. 0.01) increase in cardiovascular deaths per μg/m3 for both PM10 and SO2, and a 0.06% (S.E. 0.02) and a 0.10% (S.E. 0.02) increase in respiratory deaths per μg/m3 PM10 and SO2, respectively. For hospital admissions due to cardiovascular diseases the obtained coefficients are 0.07% (S.E. 0.02) and 0.19% (S.E. 0.03) for PM 10 and SO2, respectively, whereas the coefficients for hospital admissions due to respiratory diseases are 0.12% (S.E. 0.02) and 0.15% (S.E. 0.03) for PM10 and SO2, respectively. Exposure-response functions for the impact of long-term PM10 levels on the prevalence of chronic respiratory symptoms and diseases are derived from the results of cross-sectional questionnaire surveys, and indicate a 0.31% (S.E. 0.01) increase per μg/m3 in adults and 0.44% (S.E. 0.02) per μg/m3 in children.

Emission reductions are estimated for SO2 and particles in addition to CO2. Co-benefits of each option are estimated in terms of how effectively it improves local air quality and thereby reduces health damage from pollution. The population-weighted exposure level for particles and SO2 is estimated using air quality monitoring data, and a simplified methodology is applied to estimate the reduced exposure to the population that may result from implementing the abatement measures. Exposure-response functions from Chinese and international epidemiological studies are used to estimate the ensuing health effects. A method for estimating the impact of chronic PM10 exposure on life expectancy in the affected population is developed and applied. An economic evaluation of the reduced health effect is made by determining unit prices of health impacts based partly on damage costs and partly on the willingness-to-pay approach. Our assessment of CO2-reducing abatement options in Shanxi demonstrates that these measures entail large co-benefits and are highly profitable in a socio-economic sense. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Ethel Auster and Shauna Taylor’s Downsizing in Academic Libraries is a comprehensive study of the trials faced by Canadian academic libraries in the 1990s. The authors surveyed opinions from over 1100 librarians from across the country. Based on these surveys, they describe how downsizing was implemented, its impact on programs and services, organizational climate, and employees, and the legacy of downsizing on user services and program delivery. Their study also includes a statistical portrait of library expenditures, holdings, and staffing levels set against trends in enrolment for the period 1982-83 to 1997-98. Downsizing in Academic Libraries will be of interest to policy makers in government, universities, and libraries; to managers and staffs of academic libraries; to researchers, teachers, and students of organizational strategies, processes, and behaviour, and library and information studies; and to all stakeholders of academic libraries who are interested in what has taken place over the past decade as a result of downsizing in Canadian academic research libraries. © University of Toronto Press Incorporated 2004.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84967019382

Less is known about the role of resource availability and heterogeneity in restored communities, although restoration provides a valuable opportunity to test our understanding of factors that influence plant community assembly. We altered soil nitrogen (N) availability and soil depth during a prairie restoration to determine if the availability and/or heterogeneity of soil resources influenced plant community composition in restored grassland communities. Plant community responses to three levels of N availability (ambient, enriched by fertilization, and reduced by carbon amendment) and two levels of soil depth (deep and shallow) were evaluated. In addition, we evaluated plant community responses to four whole plot heterogeneity treatments created from the six possible combinations of soil N availability and soil depth. The soil depth treatment had little influence on community structure during the first 3 years of restoration. Total diversity and richness declined over time under annual N enrichment, whereas diversity was maintained and richness increased over time in soil with reduced N availability. Non-native species establishment was lowest in reduced-N soil in the initial year, but their presence was negligible in all of the soil N treatments by the second year of restoration. Panicum virgatum, a native perennial C4 grass, was the dominant species in all soil N treatments by year three, but the magnitude of its dominance was lowest in the reduced-N soil and highest in enriched-N soil. Consequently, the relative cover of P. virgatum was strongly correlated with community dominance and inversely related to diversity. The differential growth response of P. virgatum to soil N availability led to a higher degree of community similarity to native prairie in the reduced-N treatment than in the enriched-N treatment. There were no differences in plant community structure among the four whole plot-level heterogeneity treatments, which all exhibited the same degree of similarity to native prairie. Diversity and community heterogeneity in the whole-plot treatments appeared to be regulated by the dominant species' effect on light availability, rather than soil N heterogeneity per se. Our results indicate that a strong differential response of a dominant species to resource availability in a restored community can regulate community structure, diversity, and similarity to the native (or target) community, but the importance of resource heterogeneity in restoring diversity may be dampened in systems where a dominant species can successfully establish across a range of resource availability. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Diversity; Grassland; Nitrogen; Tallgrass prairie","nitrogen; grassland; nitrogen; plant community; prairie; resource use; restoration ecology; article; comparative study; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; environmental protection; growth, development and aging; light; longitudinal study; millet; physiology; plant physiology; population dynamics; soil; time; United States; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Kansas; Light; Longitudinal Studies; Nitrogen; Panicum; Plant Physiology; Population Dynamics; Soil; Time Factors; Panicum; Panicum virgatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942532129

Evaluating air pollution impacts of ports requires consideration of numerous sources, including marine vessels, trucks, locomotives, and off-road equipment used for moving cargo. The air quality impacts of ports are significant, with particularly large emissions of diesel exhaust, particulate matter, and nitrogen oxides. The health effects of these air pollutants to residents of local communities include asthma, other respiratory diseases, cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and premature mortality. In children, there are links with asthma, bronchitis, missed school days, and emergency room visits. The significance of these environmental health impacts requires aggressive efforts to mitigate the problem. Approaches to mitigation encompass a range of possibilities from currently available, low-cost approaches, to more significant investments for cleaner air. Examples of the former include restrictions on truck idling and the use of low-sulfur diesel fuel; the latter includes shore-side power for docked ships, and alternative fuels. A precautionary approach to port-related air pollution would encourage local production of goods in order to reduce marine traffic, greener design for new terminals, and state-of-the art approaches to emissions-control that have been successfully demonstrated at ports throughout the world. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Possible sources of the excess S loss include underestimated dry deposition, mineralization of organic S in soils, desorption of soil sulphate, oxidation of recently formed sulphides and mineral weathering. Evaluating the relative contribution of these sources and processes to SO42- export is important to our understanding of S cycling as well as to policy makers in their evaluation of the efficacy of S emission controls. In order to evaluate the potential for mineral weathering contributions to SO42- export, we measured concentration and isotopic composition (δ34S and δ18O) of SO42- in stream water, and concentration and δ34S values of four S fractions in bedrock and soil parent material in catchments of varying geological composition. Geological substrates with low S concentrations were represented by catchments underlain by quartzite and granite, whereas geological substrates with high S concentrations were represented by catchments underlain by sulphidic slate, schist and metavolcanic rocks. Catchments with S-poor bedrock had stream-water SO42- concentrations &lt;100 μeq L-1 and isotopic values consistent with those of atmospheric SO42- that had been cycled through the organic soil pool. Catchments with S-rich bedrock had stream-water SO42- concentrations ranging from 56 to 229 μeq L-1. Isotopic values deviated from those of SO42- in atmospheric deposition, clearly indicating a mineral weathering source in some cases, whereas in others spatial variability of mineral δ34S values precluded the isotopic detection of a weathering contribution. These results, along with evidence suggesting formation of secondary sulphate minerals in bedrock weathering rinds, indicate that mineral weathering may be an important source of S in the surface waters of some forested catchments in the northeastern USA. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Forest; Mineral weathering; Oxygen isotopes; Stream water; Sulphate; Sulphur isotopes","Catchments; Deposition; Minerals; Soils; Sulfur compounds; Water; Weathering; Mineral weathering; Stream water; Hydrology; forested catchment; hydrogeochemistry; streamwater; sulfur isotope; water quality; weathering; North America; United States; Vermont",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142604778

The cigarettes were smoked with either a 35 or 70cm3 puff volume and stopped 1s into the fourth puff with nitrogen gas. The morphology and elemental content were characterized from four regions within the cigarette coal; the ash, coal tip, coal base, and charred tobacco under the char line. Shred morphologies under the char line ranged from minimal surface change to melting of the cuticle, to internal vesicle formations, to tubular and irregular rod formations. These rod-shaped structures were found throughout the coal but not in the ash. In the coal base and coal tip regions, the morphologies ranged from minimally charred tobacco to shreds covered with vesicles, to carbonized shreds encrusted with inorganic crystals to partially oxidized shreds. The ash consisted of carbonized shreds to oxidized shreds of reticulate networks of inorganic crystals. Shred morphologies observed in the coal regions of the 70cm3 puff volume were similar to those seen from the coal regions of the 35cm3 puff volume, but a little more extreme with more extensive vesicle formations and more extensive tube formations. Elemental analyses showed that sodium, potassium, sulfur, and phosphorus were partially lost to the smoke stream in the coal base and coal tip. In the ash, sulfur, sodium, potassium, phosphorous, and magnesium were reduced. Carbon and nitrogen decreased in the ash while hydrogen decreased continuously from the control unburned tobacco, to the coal base, the coal tip, and the ash. Oxygen content in the unburned control tobacco decreased in the coal base with minimal to no decrease in the coal tip then a slight increase in the ash. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In this first in a series of investigations our initial conditions consist of a spherical molecular core obeying the hydrostatic Bonnor-Ebert profile with varying degrees of initial rotation. Our simulations cover both the formation of massive discs, in which massive stars form, and low-mass discs. We use a customized version of the FLASH code the AMR technique, which allows us to follow the formation of a protostellar disc and protostellar core(s) through more than 10 orders in density increase, while continuously resolving the local Jeans length (i.e. obeying the Truelove criterion). Our numerical simulations also incorporate the energy loss due to molecular line emission in order to obtain a more realistic picture of the protostellar core and disc formation. Our initial states model systems of mass 168 and 2.1 M⊙ that will form high- and low-mass stars, respectively. We follow many features such as the development complex shock structures, and the fragmentation of the disc. We find that slowly rotating cores (ω tff = 0.1) produce discs in which a strong bar develops but does not fragment. Faster initial rotation rates (ω tff = 0.2) result in the formation of a ring, which may fragment into two protostellar cores. The size of the rings found in our simulated discs agree with the observations of similar systems.","Accretion, accretion discs; Hydrodynamics; ISM: clouds; ISM: evolution; Methods: numerical",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9744268983

Significant carbon benefit can be obtained by substituting biomass derived from short-rotation woody crops (SRWC) for coal or gasoline as opposed to sequestering carbon in standing trees. When biomass substitutes fossil fuel, the use of a given piece of land is not limited to just the period until the forest matures, as in the case of afforestation. At present high costs of existing biomass-based technologies and unavailability of cost-effective technologies (e.g., biomass-integrated gasifier/steam-injected gas turbine (BIG/STIG)) limits carbon sequestration to afforestation/reforestation for which the costs have been found to be modest. If growth rates of trees in afforested/reforested lands could be increased to the levels that are comparable to SRWC, more carbon benefit could be realized for a short-term horizon from afforestation than using biomass to displace fossil fuels. Carbon sequestered through afforestation projects can be used to earn carbon credits to meet carbon reduction targets through Kyoto mechanisms. As biomass-based technologies such as BIG/STIG or conversion of biomass to ethanol become commercially viable in the future, growing SRWC for substituting fossil fuels may become a cost-effective strategy to combat climate change. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The water oxidation occurs at catalytic sites composed of four manganese atoms (Mn4-cluster) and powered by the redox potential of an oxidised chlorophyll a molecule (P680·+). Gerald T (Jerry) Babcock and colleagues showed that electron/proton transfer processes from substrate water to P680·+ involved a tyrosine residue (YZ) and proposed an attractive reaction mechanism for the direct involvement of YZ in the chemistry of water oxidation.

Location: 602 sites across the Mediterranean region. Method: We considered 12 plant morphological and phenological traits, and measured their abundance at the sites as trait scores obtained from pollen percentages. We conducted stepwise regression analyses of trait scores as a function of plant available moisture (a) and winter temperature (MTCO). Results: Patterns in the abundance for the plant traits we considered are clearly determined by a, MTCO or a combination of both. In addition, trends in leaf size, texture, thickness, pubescence and aromatic leaves and other plant level traits such as thorniness and aphylly, vary according to the life form (tree, shrub, forb), the leaf type (broad, needle) and phenology (evergreen, summer-green). Conclusions: Despite conducting this study based on pollen data we have identified ecologically plausible trends in the abundance of traits along climatic gradients. Plant traits other than the usual life form, leaf type and leaf phenology carry strong climatic signals.

Hydroxyl radicals react mostly by addition reaction forming radical adducts (λmax=420nm) and the oxidation is only a minor process even in the alkaline region. The reaction with azide radicals produced phenoxyl radicals (λmax=340nm), which are formed on fast deprotonation of solute radical cation. Using PMZ·+/PMZ and ABTS·-/ABTS2- as the reference couple, different methods are employed to determine the one-electron reduction potential of o-vanillin and the average value is estimated to be 1.076±0.004V vs. NHE at pH 6. The phenoxyl radicals of o-vanillin were able to oxidize ABTS 2- quantitatively. The eaq- is observed to react with o-vanillin with rate constant value of 2×1010dm 3mol-1s-1. CO2·- and acetone ketyl radical are also observed to react with o-vanillin by electron transfer mechanism and showed the formation of transient absorption bands with λmax at 350 and 390nm at pH 4.5 and 9.7, respectively.

LiVTiO4 is a member of the general series, LiMTiO4 where M represents a 3d transition metal and was synthesized by a simple solid-state ceramic approach involving lithium carbonate, V2O3 and TiO2. The lithium insertion behavior in the LiVTiO4 relies on the reversibility of the V 3+/V4+ redox couple and preliminary electrochemical evaluation indicates a reversible specific capacity of around 90 mA h/g, which represents the cycling of just over half the available lithium in the structure. High-resolution measurements reveal a structureless and sloping voltage profile consistent with the lithium insertion reactions proceeding via a single-phase mechanism. The lithium extraction and insertion reactions are located at 3.16 and 2.85 V vs. Li, respectively, while the symmetrical nature of the differential capacity data confirms the electrochemical reversibility. By comparison, the structurally related LiCrTiO4 phase demonstrates redox activity in the potential range 4.5-4.8 V vs. Li, although this behavior is accompanied by significant irreversibility.

Its assumed history and influence on palaeoclimate, while almost certainly equally profound, are here called into question. In this paper, we review 30 years of accumulated data, interpretation and speculation about the ACC, deriving mainly from DSDP and ODP drilling in the Southern Ocean. For most of this time, a conventional view of ACC development, signature and influence has held sway among palaeoceanographers and marine geologists. In this view, the ACC began at about 34 Ma, close to the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, the time of onset of significant Antarctic glaciation and the time of creation of a deep-water gap (Tasmanian Seaway) between Australia and Antarctica as the South Tasman Rise separated from North Victoria Land. This is the ""smoking gun"" of synchroneity. The Southern Ocean sediment record shows a latest Eocene development and subsequent geographic expansion of a siliceous biofacies, its northern limit taken to indicate the palaeo-position of the ACC axis. In addition, the ACC was considered to have caused Antarctic glaciation by isolating the continent within a cold-water annulus, reducing north-south heat transport. A different (and later) date for Antarctic-South American opening (""Drake Passage"") was proposed, but the timing of ACC onset there was disputed, and the simple story survived. Recent developments, however, call it into question. Modern physical oceanography shows that all or most of present-day ACC transport is confined to narrow jets within deep-reaching circumpolar fronts, and numerical modelling has suggested that a steady reduction in greenhouse gas concentration through the Cenozoic could cause Antarctic glaciation, with or without a contribution from ocean circulation change. The rapidity of Antarctic glacial onset at the Eocene-Oligocene boundary and coeval creation of a deep-water gap south of Tasmania both survive but, in light of the new information, the presence of a siliceous biofacies cannot be claimed as evidence of the existence of a continuous, deep-reaching oceanic front and therefore of an ACC, and the possibility arises that cool and cold sea-surface temperatures were effects of Antarctic glaciation rather than evidence of a major contributor to its cause. In considering future work, we emphasise the importance of additional information from ancillary fields-better definition of the necessary and sufficient properties of oceanic fronts, additional determinations of Cenozoic atmospheric pCO2 and further developments in models of Antarctic glaciation-but also suggest the way forward in marine geology. Our knowledge of the development and palaeoclimatic significance of the ACC will be best served by grain-size studies of bottom current strength at selected locations, and geochemical or mineralogical studies of clays and IRD as a way of examining provenance and therefore surface and bottom current directions and the existence of interocean connections. Studies of biogenic assemblages within the same sediments may be able to recover a value for the many such studies undertaken in the past and interpreted, probably erroneously, as evidence for an ACC. Mainly in view of the timing uncertainties, we propose the region south of South America as the best initial focus of future investigation. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.","ACC; Antarctic Circumpolar Current; DSDP; Oceanic fronts; ODP; Palaeocirculation; Palaeoclimate","Antarctic Circumpolar Wave; atmosphere-ocean coupling; circumpolar current; oceanic current; paleoclimate; Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942714998

The objective of this work was to contrast emissions of CH4 and non-methane organic compounds (NMOCs) from landfill cells covered with soil or a biologically active cover consisting of yard waste compost. On the basis of four field campaigns over 14 months, CH4 emissions from the biocover (BC) varied from -1.73 to 1.33 g m-2 d-1, with atmospheric uptake measured in 52% of tests. BC emissions did not increase when the gas collection system was turned off. Uptake of atmospheric CH4 was measured in 54% of tests on the soil cover (SC) when the gas collection was system active and 12% when the gas collection system was off. Many (26%) relatively high fluxes (&gt; 15 g m -2 d-1) were measured from the SC as were some dramatic effects due to deactivation of the gas collection system. In tests with positive emissions, stable isotope measurements showed that the BC and SC were responsible for oxidation of 55% and 21% of the CH4 reaching the bottom of the respective cover. Seven of the highest 10 NMOC emissions were measured in the SC, and 17 of 21 fluxes for speciated organic compounds were higher in the SC. The relationship between CH4, NMOC, and individual organic compound emissions suggested a correlation between CH4 and trace organic oxidation. BCs can reduce landfill gas emissions in the absence of a gas collection system and can serve as a polishing step in the presence of an active system.",,"Environmental engineering; Greenhouse effect; Impurities; Organic compounds; Oxidation; Gas collection systems; Non-methane organic compounds (NMOC); Soil cover (SC); Land fill; isotope; methane; organic compound; emission control; greenhouse gas; landfill; air pollution; article; atmosphere; compost; greenhouse gas; landfill; measurement; oxidation; soil; Air Pollutants; Carbon Isotopes; Hydrocarbons, Acyclic; Hydrocarbons, Cyclic; Hydrocarbons, Halogenated; Kentucky; Methane; Refuse Disposal; Soil; Volatilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544327627

It does this by describing the effects of large–scale migration away from the small island state of Niue, which is a very good analogue from which lessons for other islands can be drawn. The chapter begins by examining the discourse on large–scale migration as a solution to save the people of the Pacific Islands from the impacts of climate change. The discourse of draining the people from these remote island backwaters of the world persists even though understanding of vulnerability and adaptation to climate change in the Pacific Islands remains extremely limited. In this discourse there is little concern for the needs and rights of migrants, and no consideration of the consequences of such movements for those people who cannot or do not wish to move. It is this latter issue that this chapter examines. There has been large–scale migration from Niue since 1971, to the extent that 80 per cent of the people born in Niue now live in New Zealand. There are six principal effects of this depopulation on those who remain on the island, namely that it leads to: distortions in markets; obsolescent political and administrative institutions; a hyper–concentration of social capital; increased demands on labour; difficulties in defining and maintaining that which is ‘traditional’ and an erosion of Niuean identity. Based on this examination, the chapter argues that migration is likely to be an impact of climate change as much as it is to be an adaptation. Mitigation and adaptation must therefore be the preferred strategies, although there may be scope for carefully managed labour migration as part of a suite of adaptation strategies. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925587272

In this paper, some effects of emissions trading on technology deployment when technology learning is endogenized are examined with a multi-regional ""bottom-up"" energy-systems optimization MARKAL model of the global energy system. In this framework, due to the action of spillovers of learning, imposing emission constraints on a given region may affect the technology choice and emissions profiles of other (unconstrained) regions. The effects depend on the geographical scale of the learning process but also on the presence of emissions trading, the regions that join the trade system and their timing for doing so.

Even though the focus of this paper is on positron-emitting labeled probes, it is also justified to extend this proposed regulatory approach to other diagnostic nuclear medicine radiopharmaceuticals. Key aspects of this proposal include: (1) PET molecular imaging probes would be placed in a ""no significant risk"" category, similar to that category for devices in current Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, based on overwhelming scientific evidence that demonstrates their faultless safety profile; (2) the FDA-sanctioned Radioactive Drug Research Committee (RDRC) will oversee all diagnostic research with these probes. The newly defined RDRC should approve ""first in man"" use; supervise a broader spectrum of diagnostic research protocols, including those looking to demonstrate initial efficacy, as well as multicenter clinical trials and the use of molecular imaging probes as a screening tool in drug discovery. The current investigational new drug (IND) mechanism is thus eliminated for these diagnostic probes; (3) when a molecular imaging probe has demonstrated diagnostic efficacy, FDA approval (i.e., NDA) will be sought. The review will be done by a newly constituted Radioactive Drug Advisory Committee (RDAC) composed of experts chosen by the professional societies, who would provide a binding assessment of the adequacy of the safety and efficacy data. When the RDAC recommends its diagnostic use on scientific and medical grounds, the molecular imaging probe becomes FDA approved. After a molecular imaging probe is approved for a diagnostic indication, the existing mechanism to seek reimbursement will be utilized; and (4) the FDA would retain its direct oversight function for traditional manufacturers engaged in commercial distribution of the approved diagnostic molecular imaging probes (i.e., under NDA) to monitor compliance with existing US Pharmacopeia (USP) requirements. With abbreviated and more appropriate regulations, new PET molecular imaging probes for diagnostic use would be then rapidly incorporated into the mainstream diagnostic medicine. Equally importantly, this approach would facilitate the use of molecular imaging in drug discovery and development, which would substantially reduce the costs and time required to bring new therapeutic drugs to market. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This method involves the continual mass release of sterile flies, which suppress or eliminate any introduced wild fly populations. In addition, Jackson traps baited with trimedlure are deployed throughout the preventative release region for the dual purpose of detecting wild flies and monitoring released sterile flies. Sterile fly recapture data for a 3-yr period was compared with climate and to host plant (in which traps were placed). Precipitation was negatively correlated; and temperature and relative humidity were positively correlated with fly recapture levels. The highest numbers of flies were recaptured during trapping periods associated with intermediate relative humidity and temperature, and low precipitation. Flies were recaptured throughout the entire year, in traps that had been frequently relocated to host plants with fruit. This finding suggests that these flies were capable of locating acceptable fruit in a variety of abiotic conditions. However, these data do not necessarily suggest that measurements unimportant in explaining sterile fly recapture are not of value in determining other outcomes important to the goals of sterile release programs, such as reducing the likelihood of establishment of an introduced wild Mediterranean fruit fly population. Future research might build on these results in developing more precise models useful in predicting recapture of sterile flies.","Ceratitis capitata; Precipitation; Sterile insect technique; Temperature; Trapping","Capitata; Ceratitis; Ceratitis capitata; Ceratitis capitata; Diptera; Drosophila melanogaster; Insecta; Tephritidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8344283635

Homogeneous cluster anions (OCS)q- (q=1-12) are predominantly formed. In addition, due to CS2 impurities in the OCS sample, mixed cluster anions ((OCS)q-1CS2 -, q≥1) are observed at levels of a few percent. The energy dependences of cluster anion formation are characterized by a strong rise towards zero energy attributed to s-wave attachment as well as - below the onsets of the (0 1 0), (0 0 1), and (0 2 0) vibrational modes of the OCS molecule - by vibrational Feshbach resonances (VFR) whose importance decreases towards larger cluster sizes q. Formation of the (OCS)2- anion is especially enhanced at near-zero electron energies; moreover, the attachment spectrum exhibits a sharp VFR resonance just below the onset for excitation of the (0 2 0) mode in the OCS molecule. The electron attachment behaviour of OCS clusters is intermediate between that of CO2 clusters (which is dominated by VFRs) and that of CS2 (which exhibits a strong zero energy peak, but no VFRs). This finding is correlated with the properties of the respective molecular neutrals and anions which have been studied using high level ab initio methods. We also report the energetics of the neutral and the anion dimer species. The role of VFRs as doorway states into valence-type anion states is discussed. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The numerical model was firstly validated against experimental data collected in a tunnel greenhouse identical with the one used in simulations. The airflow patterns were measured and collected using a three-dimensional sonic anemometer and the greenhouse ventilation rate was deduced using a tracer gas technique. A good qualitative and quantitative agreement was found between the numerical results and the experimental measurements. After its validation, the CFD model was used to study the consequences of four different ventilator configurations on the natural ventilation system. The ventilation configuration affects the ventilation rate of the greenhouse and the airflow and air temperature distributions as well. For the different configurations, computed ventilation rates varied from 10 to 58 air changes per hour for an outside wind speed of 3ms-1 and for a wind direction perpendicular to the openings. Likewise, the simulations highlight that while the mean air temperature at the middle of the tunnels varied from 28·2 to 29·8°C, for an outside air temperature of 28°C, there are regions inside tunnels 6°C warmer than outside air. Average air velocity in the crop cover varied according to the arrangement of the vents from 0·2 to 0·7ms-1. The consequences of the marked climate heterogeneity on plant activity through the variation of crop aerodynamic resistance as well as the influence of the vent configurations on the efficiencies of ventilation on flow rate and air temperature differences between inside and outside, are also discussed. © 2004 Silsoe Research Institute.

We hypothesized that mosses with varying physiologies would create different conditions for methane-oxidizing bacteria and, in turn, affect rates of CH4 consumption. We measured in-vitro CH4 consumption potential of Sphagnum magellanicum and Sphagnum capillifoliun taken from the same habitat and S. magellanicum and Sphagnum majus across habitats to compare and contrast species and environmental effects. In certain cases, S. capillifolium consumed CH4 more rapidly than S. magellanicum taken from identical habitats, although the greatest difference in consumption rates between species was only 29 μg CH4 g-1 dry moss d-1, compared to a maximum difference of 126 and 415 μg CH4 g-1 dry moss d-1 in S. magellanicum and S. majus sampled from different habitats. In most cases, CH4 was consumed most rapidly in the lower, non-photosynthetic portions of the Sphagnum mosses, and consumption potential increased with an increase in the concentration of CH4 in the habitat. We hypothesize that CH4 consumption occurred internally, likely in the hyaline cells, as external surface sterilization did not significantly alter CH4 consumption rates. This work provides evidence that different Sphagnum moss species have variable ability to oxidize CH4, although inter-species differences are small compared to differences across habitats. © 2004, The Society of Wetland Scientists.","Methane; Methane consumption; Peatlands; Sphagnum","bacterium; methane; moss; oxidation; peatland; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bryophyta; Sphagnum; Sphagnum capillifolium; Sphagnum capillifolium; Sphagnum magellanicum; Sphagnum magellanicum; Sphagnum majus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16544362743

Methods: We used a case-crossover study to examine PM10-associated mortality risk during 1988-1991 among 65,180 elderly residents of Cook County, Illinois, who had a history of hospitalization for heart or lung disease. We assessed how the effect was independently modified by specific diagnoses and personal characteristics. Results: We found a 1.14% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.44% to 1.85%) increased risk of death per 10 μg/m3 increase in ambient PM10 concentration. Persons with heart or lung disease-but no specific diagnosis of myocardial infarction, diabetes, congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder, or conduction disorders-were at 0.74% (-0.29% to 1.79%) increased risk. Persons with a history of myocardial infarction had a 2.7-fold higher risk (CI = -2.1 to 7.4). Those with diabetes carried a 2.0-fold higher risk (CI = -1.5 to 5.5). Risk appeared to decrease with age among elderly men and increase with age among elderly women, but the estimated 3-way interaction was not precise enough to exclude the null. We found no indication that susceptibility varied by group-level socioeconomic measures. Conclusion: Among a frail population, individuals diagnosed with myocardial infarction or diabetes were at greatest risk of death associated with high concentrations of PM10. These results suggest that their susceptibility may derive from prior vascular damage to the heart.

This climate model simulates a cooling of about 3.6 K over the North Atlantic induced by a meltwater pulse from Lake Agassiz routed through the Hudson strait. The meltwater pulse is assumed to have a volume of 1.6 × 1014 m3 and a period of discharge of 2 years on the basis of glaciological modeling of the decay of the Laurentide Ice Sheet (LIS). We present a possible mechanism which can explain the centennial duration of the 8.2 cay cold event. The mechanism is related to the existence of an additional equilibrium climate state with reduced North Atlantic Deep Water (NADW) formation and a southward shift of the NADW formation area. Hints at the additional climate state were obtained from the largely varying duration of the pulse-induced cold episode in response to overlaid random freshwater fluctuations in Monte Carlo simulations. The model equilibrium state was attained by releasing a weak multicentury freshwater flux through the St. Lawrence pathway completed by the meltwater pulse. The existence of such a climate mode appears essential for reproducing climate anomalies in close agreement with paleoclimatic reconstructions of the 8.2 cay event. The results furthermore suggest that the temporal evolution of the cold event was partly a matter of chance.

This route uses crystal-controlled 1,4-addition polymerization of diacetylene groups in cyclic monomer molecules to make organic nanotubes, whose three-dimensional covalent network combines carbon-carbon bonds of the cyclic monomer and four parallel polydiacetylene chains formed by solid-state reaction. Up to 75% of the carbon-carbon bonds of the target carbon nanotube are correctly connected in the organic nanotube, and none are incorrectly connected. Target monomers are down selected by using molecular mechanics calculations to predict the allowable crystal packing parameters, from which topochemical reactivity is predicted using a well-established reactivity diagram. This approach correctly predicts the solid-state polymerizability of a cyclic diacetylene that we experimentally demonstrated forms a targeted hydrocarbon nanotube. Substituent extrusion is the final step in forming the carbon nanotube from the organic nanotube, which should occur cleanly because the covalent connectivity of the organic nanotube holds the structure in place. Using this two-step topochemical control of reaction and structure, during formation of the organic nanotube and during substituent extrusion, routes to armchair and zigzag SWNTs having different ring diameters are proposed. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Since, these enzymes are pluripotent, the physiological role for the human AKR1C isozymes is determined by their tissue-specific expression patterns and their substrate availability in target tissues.

The reaction was studied independently as a function of H2O (or D2O) and SF6 (bath gas) pressures. At a fixed pressure of SF6 (5 Torr), [SiH2] decay constants, kobs, showed a quadratic dependence on [H 2O] or [D2O]. At a fixed pressure of H2O or D2O, kobs values were strongly dependent on [SF 6]. The combined rate expression is consistent with a mechanism involving the reversible formation of a vibrationally excited zwitterionic donor-acceptor complex, H2Si⋯OH2 (or H 2Si⋯OD2). This complex can then either be stabilized by SF6 or it reacts with a further molecule of H 2O (or D2O) in the rate-determining step. Isotope effects are in the range 1.0-1.5 and are broadly consistent with this mechanism. The mechanism is further supported by RRKM theory, which shows the association reaction to be close to its third-order region of pressure (SF6) dependence. Ab initio quantum calculations, carried out at the G3 level, support the existence of a hydrated zwitterion H2Si⋯(OH 2)2, which can rearrange to hydrated silanol, with an energy barrier below the reaction energy threshold.

Since the publication of the ITWP, congestion has emerged as a more salient concern, while a combination of increasing public dissatisfaction over progress on transport, a number of political shocks (a national fuel duty protest, in particular) and institutional change have combined to effect an apparent shift away from the original 'joined-up' philosophy. It is argued that the Government is now focusing on investing in transport infrastructure and has been slow to promote policies to manage demand for road use such as congestion charging. The short-lived marriage of transport and environmental policy is facing a stern test. Although, local air pollution has been falling due to improved engine technology, it is argued that CO2 emissions from road traffic will increase in the future, jeopardising the UK's ability to hit its climate change targets. In conclusion, it is argued that greater integration of policy is required (possibly through a Ministerial Committee, but not through further departmental restructuring), while the introduction of a national road charging scheme would reduce CO2 and further reduce local air pollution. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

For emissions' measurement, an experimental setup is designed, involving a three-axial magnetic-field sensor mounted on an antenna positioner, and optically linked to the data-handling system. Measurement is accomplished in the time domain and allows one to retrieve digitized time scries of the spatial components of the magnetic-flux density (MFD) vector, at specific points in the measurement volume. Worst case emissions are related to the train operating modes by referring to an experiment that includes acceleration from an initial stop, inertial motion, and braking up to a new stop. The nonstationary behavior of the most relevant MFD sinusoidal components is evidenced, and it is accounted in the spectral analysis by resorting to short-time Fourier transform bused on a fixed-length time windows of proper duration. For safety assessment, a compliance check of MFE levels with exposure limits is proposed, based on the computation of an instantaneous safety parameter, obtained by extending requirements developed in the International Commission on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection guidelines for the simpler case of multiple-frequency steady-state fields.","Human exposure to electromagnetic fields; Magnetic-field measurement; Radiated emissions; Railway transportation systems","Accident prevention; Electromagnetic field effects; Electromagnetic wave emission; Fourier transforms; Ionizing radiation; Magnetic field measurement; Railroad transportation; Spectrum analysis; Time domain analysis; Time series analysis; Magnetic flux density; Non-stationary low frequency magnetic field emissions; Radiated emissions; Rolling stock; Time domain measurement; Magnetic fields",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842474460

Here, we describe effects of elevated concentrations of CO2 on an understory plant community in terms of production and community composition. • In 2001 and 2002 total and species-specific above-ground net primary productivity (ANPP) were estimated by harvesting above-ground biomass within an understory community receiving ambient [CO2] and elevated [CO2] at Oak Ridge National Laboratory's free-air carbon dioxide enrichment (FACE) facility. • During a wet year, community composition differed between plots receiving ambient [CO2] and elevated [CO2], but total ANPP did not differ. By contrast, during a drier year, community composition did not differ, but total ANPP was greater in elevated than ambient [CO2] plots. These patterns were driven by the response of two codominant species, Lonicera japonica and Microstegium vimineum, both considered invasive species in the south-eastern United States. The ANPP of L. japonica was consistently greater under elevated [CO2], whereas the response of M. vimineum to CO 2 enrichment differed between years and mediated total community response. • These data suggest that community and species responses to a future, CO2-enriched atmosphere may be mediated by other environmental factors and will depend on individual species responses.","Co2 enrichment; Invasive species; Lonicera japonica; Microstegium vimineum; Understory communities","biological invasion; carbon dioxide enrichment; community composition; plant community; primary production; soil water; understory; Japonica; Lonicera; Lonicera japonica; Microstegium; Microstegium vimineum; Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1042278598

We tested the role of abiotic and biotic factors that potentially influence spatial gradients of total ion content, acidity, carbon, total nitrogen, and total phosphorous in topsoil. We studied a network of Mediterranean montane meadows that spans a 2000-m altitudinal gradient. The analyzed factors were grouped into two spatial scales: a landscape scale (climate and land form) and a field scale (topography, soil texture, soil moisture, and plant community composition). Total ion content and acidity are the major and independent variation trends of soil geochemistry. Soil acidity, carbon, and nitrogen increased along the altitudinal gradient whereas there was no relationship between total ion content and phosphorous and elevation. Climate had no direct influence on the analyzed gradients; all effects of climate were indirect through plant community composition and/or soil moisture. The results point to three types of models that explain the gradients of soil chemical composition: (1) a predominantly biotic control of carbon and nitrogen, (2) a predominantly abiotic control of acidity, and (3) a combined biotic and abiotic control of total ionic content. No direct or indirect effects explained the gradient of phosphorous. In our study region (central Spain), climate is predicted to turn more arid and soils will lose moisture. According to our models, this will result in less acid and fertile soils, and any change in plant community composition will modify gradients of soil carbon, nitrogen, total ion content, and acidity.","Acidity; Carbon; Mediterranean plant communities; Nitrogen; Spatial scale; Total ion content","acidity; meadow; soil carbon; soil nitrogen; soil property; spatial variation; vegetation cover; Eurasia; Europe; Southern Europe; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042724717

In this context, with the increase in consumption of world petroleum, one of the major challenges of the petroleum and automobile industries is to limit the progression of CO 2 emissions on over the road transport by activating innovative engineering solutions. The energy demand in transport should follow the demand for electricity in the coming 30 yr. Today, this economic sector uses almost exclusively petroleum products. This raises the questions as to whether the rhythm of renewal of petroleum reserves will allow the assurance of a sufficient supply and can the means be developed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that this activity engenders. In this time frame, the question is asked as to whether alternative solutions will arise to inflect the inexorable increase of CO 2 emissions and build the post-petroleum transition. The discussion covers the struggle against local and global pollution as becoming irreversible; a multitude of responses including from today's fuels and those of tomorrow, with continuous progress in traditional engines to innovative engineering in the long term; two deciding criteria; the environmental and economic balances of the different alternative solutions; and an open avenue on a multitude of potential solutions. The transport sector of energy use in the coming 50 yr should inflect the trend to the increase in CO 2 emissions between now and 2030. In the short term, biofuels offer the advantage of making the most rapid impact on greenhouse gas emissions. The hybrid solutions seem to present also a good environmental/cost compromise. In the long term, there is open competition between the engine vehicle and all its foreseeable technical improvements and an electric vehicle where the energy is stored on board the vehicle in improved batteries or in a hydrogen fuel cell system.

These difficulties are noted mainly in more densely populated areas that are poorly served by public transportation facilities and where the planning and use of existing areas is inadequate. The importance of controlling parking spaces as an integral element of the traffic and trip demand management process, together with the need to ensure a close-linked conceptual approach, has been defined and defended for quite some time. This paper presents a methodological procedure that underpins the feasibility of implementing an integrated parking system based on telematics resources. This procedure includes the development of a logic architecture for processing and transferring data and information. In order to test the proposed procedure, a medium-sized Brazilian town in the Rio de Janeiro Metropolitan Region-Niterói-was considered.

Methodological boundaries of single-discipline analyses limit the contribution of academic research to the real-world questions facing Arctic residents. Oversimplified assumptions and lack of data hamper mainstream economic approaches based on rational choice, while more grounded approaches suffer from inability to generalize. We attempt to integrate these two approaches to project the effects of climate change on subsistence hunting in a Canadian Arctic community. In our collaboration, we find that rational choice modeling suggests specific questions that help direct the grounded research. Grounded methods provide general relationships and hypotheses as well as data for economic modeling. Using local knowledge (LK) obtained from grounded methods, we estimate a discrete-choice travel-cost model of subsistence hunting, projecting that climate warming may cost a typical household the equivalent of a half day of lost time during a hunting season. Besides providing data needed to make rational choice applications realistic, grounded methods reveal qualitative information essential for understanding relationships. We conclude that integration and synthesis of these disparate analytical approaches provides insights that neither method alone could have produced. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

To alleviate this concern, the Government of Canada is proposing to cap the price of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission permits and to allocate emission permits on the basis of output. We analyze how such a scheme could affect electricity production and trade between Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, New England, and New York. We find that the approach of the Canadian government has little effect on electricity production and trade; it also fails to reduce GHG emissions. If the allocation and production of emission permits were unbundled and if Canadian electricity producers were facing a permit price of $15 per tonne of CO2, then the effect in Canada would depend on how limiting were the constraints on GHG emission in the US region.

The effect of these manipulations on the distribution of metabolites in Escherichia coli was assessed in minimal and complex medium under anoxic conditions. Our in vivo system to increase intracellular NADH availability expressed a heterologous NAD+- dependent formate dehydrogenase (FDH) from Candida boidinii in E. coli. The heterologous FDH pathway converted 1 mol formate into 1 mol NADH and carbon dioxide, in contrast to the native FDH where cofactor involvement was not present. Previously, we found that this NADH regeneration system doubled the maximum yield of NADH from 2 mol to 4 mol NADH/mol glucose consumed. In the current study, we found that yields of greater than 4 mol NADH were achieved when carbon sources more reduced than glucose were combined with our in vivo NADH regeneration system. This paper demonstrates experimentally that different levels of NADH availability can be achieved by combining the strategies of feeding the cells with carbon sources which have different oxidation states and regenerating NADH through the heterologous FDH pathway. The general trend of the data is substantially similar for minimal and complex media. The NADH availability obtained positively correlates with the proportion of reduced by-products in the final culture.

Correct simulations of aerosols are also required in order to elaborate particle emission reduction strategies. The CHIMERE chemistry transport model (Atmos. Environ. 35 (2001) 6277) has been improved to account for particle transport, formation, deposition at the European scale. The aerosol model accounts both for inorganic (NO3-, SO 42-, NH4+) and organic species of primary or secondary origin. Secondary organic aerosols from biogenic and anthropogenic gas precursors are partitioned into gas and particulate phases through a temperature dependent partition coefficient. The modeling approach is presented in this paper with preliminary simulation results over Europe. Comparisons with available data at background stations give acceptable results on PM10, with correlation coefficients usually exceeding 0.5 and normalized errors in the 30-80% range in many regions. However, results on sulfate, nitrate and ammonium species display less correct error statistics. Comparisons on sulfate concentrations give normalized errors in the range 30-80% in summer and less correct in winter. Temporal correlation coefficients usually range from 0.30 to 0.70. Nitrate concentrations are better simulated during winter than during summer. Difficulties in simulating heterogeneous and aqueous phase processes could explain model deficiencies. Moreover, temperature dependence of gas/particle partitioning processes for nitrate, ammonium and secondary organic species could mainly explain the seasonal variability of biases. Model deficiencies are observed in Southern countries, certainly due to natural dust emissions and resuspended particles. Finally, sea salts seems to have a quite significant influence on error statistics in coastal areas. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

While the existence and potential significance of such networks has been documented, many questions concerning the nature of governance conducted by such networks and their impact remain. We contribute to these debates by examining how such networks are created and maintained and the extent to which they can foster policy learning and change. We focus on the Cities for Climate Protection (CCP) program, a network of some 550 local governments concerned with promoting local initiatives for the mitigation of climate change. It is frequently asserted that the importance of such networks lies in their ability to exchange knowledge and information, and to forge norms about the nature and terms of particular issues. However, we find that those local governments most effectively engaged with the network are mobilized more by the financial and political resources it offers, and the legitimacy conferred to particular norms about climate protection, than by access to information. Moreover, processes of policy learning within the CCP program take place in discursive struggles as different actors seek legitimacy for their interpretations of what local climate protection policies should mean. In conclusion, we reflect upon the implications of these findings for understanding the role of transnational networks in global environmental governance. © 2004 International Studies Association.",,"climate change; environmental management; environmental policy; global perspective; international relations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842590064

Moreover, we investigated the relationships between the olfactometric assessment of odour concentration and PTR-MS spectral line intensity finding a positive correlation between the former and several masses and their overall intensity. The application of multivariate calibration methods allows to determine odour concentrations based only on PTR-MS instrumental data.

In order to explore differences in application requirements between large and small displacement motorcycles, a large twin-cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled motorcycle, and a small single cylinder, four-stroke, air-cooled motorcycle were utilized. The primary objectives of this study were to meet current and future emissions regulations for motorcycle exhaust emissions, to raise fuel economy, and to improve overall engine performance. The EFI development required baseline testing, control system setup, design of intake system components, installation of sensors and control unit, fuel system integration, steady-state and transient calibration, fuel consumption development, emissions development, performance improvement, and acceleration testing. In order to perform all tests, a motorcycle chassis eddy-current dynamometer, a five-gas emissions bench, wide-range oxygen sensor, and fuel flow measurement equipment were used. A software tool, particularly designed for the custom electronic control unit (ECU), was used to perform all calibration work and record ECU related data. Using a sophisticated EFI system offers precise control over the air/fuel ratio for each cylinder over the entire engine operation range. Additionally, the ignition timing and the timing of injection can be controlled by the EFI system. All steady-state and transient calibration tables were calibrated based on the results of conducted emissions, fuel consumption, and performance tests in order to improve performance while meeting the required emissions standards and improving the engine performance. Integration of the EFI system resulted in the reduction of engine out emissions, an improvement in fuel economy, especially for the small displacement single cylinder engine, as well as improved engine output performance. © 2004 Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc.",,"Calibration; Control systems; Cooling systems; Engine cylinders; Fuel systems; Fuels; Gas emissions; Integration testing; Motorcycles; Application requirements; Eddy current dynamometer; Electronic control units; Electronic fuel injections; Performance improvements; Single cylinder engine; Southwest Research Institute; Steady state and transients; Fuel economy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877178178

According to this, existing plants have been required to cut emissions; moreover, there has been a greater emphasis on adopting efficient systems in order to reduce the energy losses. Among high efficiency technologies, fuel cells appear to be the most promising for their high efficiency and their very low environmental impact. This paper first reviews the state-of-the-art of fuel cells systems, then simulates the operation of a hybrid fuel cells plant in a ""typical hospital"" analysing how it could optimize the hospitals energetic requirements. Hospitals and sanitary structures are normally characterized by considerable energy demands not often suitable with resolute energy retrofit strategies. Both the considerable primary energy savings and the pollutant emissions reduction, achieved upgrading conventional systems to a fuel cell hybrid plant, have the potential to prompt national boards to support their business development, as long as they achieve a consolidated market penetration. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

To help fill this gap, this paper presents original data from a survey of plants participating in the Program for Pollution Control, Evaluation and Rating (PROPER), Indonesia's widely acclaimed public disclosure program. The data suggest that a key means by which PROPER spurs abatement is improving factory managers' information about their own plants' emissions and abatement opportunities. These finding contrast with the prevailing view in the literature that public disclosure enhances pressures to abate placed on firms by external agents such as community groups and shareholders. But our data also suggest that PROPER's ""environmental audit"" effect operates in concert with external pressures. Therefore, simply supplying new information to plant managers without making that information public may not be sufficient to motivate significant abatement.","Asia; Environment; Indonesia; Informal regulation; PROPER; Public disclosure",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12344288332

The question is whether those components will generate net emission reductions that will contribute to the stabilization of the greenhouse gas concentration at a safe level in the long run. It comes out that the Bush Administration climate policy does not guarantee any meaningful contribution to climate protection. The lenient emission intensity target set by the Administration will most likely allow near term emissions to grow. In the long run, the Bush Administration places a big bet on future climate-friendly technological breakthroughs to cost-effectively compensate for the current and near term net emission increases. But the outcomes of those technological developments are uncertain in terms of emission reduction potential, cost, and timing. The way towards enhanced climate protection will most likely not come from the policies of the current Administration, but rather from the growing concern about the climate issue in Congress and at the state, corporate and civil society levels.

A reductase (MMOR), which contains [2Fe-2S] and FAD cofactors, facilitates electron transfer from NADH to the hydroxylase diiron active sites where dioxygen activation and substrate hydroxylation take place. By separately expressing the ferredoxin (MMOR. Fd, MMOR residues 1-98) and FAD/NADH (MMOR-FAD, MMOR residues 99-348) domains of the reductase, nearly all biochemical properties of full-length MMOR are retained, except for interdomain electron transfer rates. To investigate the extent to which rapid electron transfer between domains might be restored and further to explore the modularity of MMOR, MMOR-Fd and MMOR-FAD were connected in a non-native fashion. Four different linker sequences were employed to create MMOR reversed-domain (MMOR-RD) constructs, MMOR(99-342)-linker-MMOR(2-98), with a domain connectivity observed in other homologous oxidoreductases. The optical, redox, and electron transfer properties of the four MMOR-RD proteins were characterized and compared with those of wild-type MMOR. The linker sequence plays a key role in controlling solvent accessibility to the FAD cofactor, as evidenced by perturbed flavin optical spectra, decreased FADox/FADsq redox potentials, and increased steady-state oxidase activities in three of the constructs. Stopped-flow optical spectroscopy revealed slow interdomain electron transfer (k &lt; 0.04 s-1 at 4 °C, compared with 90 s-1 for wild-type MMOR) for all three MMOR-RD proteins with 7-residue linkers. A long (14-residue), flexible linker afforded much faster electron transfer between the FAD and [2Fe-2S] cofactors (k = 0.9 s-1 at 4 °C).",,"Catalysis; Electron transport properties; Enzymes; Methane; Methanol; Redox reactions; Spectroscopic analysis; Electron transfer rates; Three component enzyme systems; Biochemistry; ferredoxin; flavine adenine nucleotide; methane; methane monooxygenase; methanol; oxidoreductase; oxygen; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide; solvent; article; catalysis; electron transport; enzyme active site; enzyme activity; enzyme regulation; hydroxylation; Methylococcus capsulatus; nonhuman; optics; oxidation reduction potential; priority journal; protein domain; protein engineering; steady state; Catalysis; Crystallography, X-Ray; DNA; Electron Transport; Electrons; Flavins; Genetic Vectors; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Kinetics; Methylococcus capsulatus; Models, Chemical; Models, Molecular; Mutagenesis, Site-Directed; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Oxygenases; Plasmids; Protein Structure, Tertiary; Spectrophotometry; Temperature; Ultraviolet Rays; Bacteria (microorganisms); Methylococcus; Methylococcus capsulatus; Negibacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242317007

Consumers are not providing a pull towards energy efficiency, usually because they are ignorant of (or indifferent to) the range on the market, or the energy implications of their purchases. Whilst consumers are concerned about climate change and generally understand the causal role of fossil fuels, they believe either that they have done everything or that one person cannot make a difference. Without a positive design focus from manufacturers or a clear demand from consumers, no part of the market will deliver energy efficiency naturally: policy has to provide the drive. Within the UK, the opportunities to introduce policies based on higher energy prices are constrained by the impact these have on low-income households. This means that product policy (market transformation) has to be the main delivery mechanism for domestic energy efficiency in the UK. The policies adopted so far in the UK and EU have been successful, with existing products, but have not prevented the development of new, profligate equipment. This limited success demonstrates the need for European policy to be more forceful and for policy to involve engagement with manufacturers about the products they are planning to introduce. To motivate consumers, policy should focus on carbon and incorporate feedback.

It was revealed that quantum yield of the IPE of different lines were equal in the range of values 10-4-10-7 photon/ion and increases in 5-7 times of that originated from decay of atomic excited states with Eex≤4.83 eV for oxides to compare with metal.

Oxic soils are a net sink while wetland soils are a net source of atmospheric methane. It has generally been accepted that the consumption of methane in upland as well as lowland systems is inhibited by nitrogenous fertiliser additions. Hence, mineral nitrogen (i.e. ammonium/nitrate) has conceptually been treated as a component with the potential to enhance emission of methane from soils and sediments to the atmosphere, and results from numerous studies have been interpreted as such. Recently, ammonium-based fertilisation was demonstrated to stimulate methane consumption in rice paddies. Growth and activity of methane-consuming bacteria in microcosms as well as in natural rice paddies was N limited. Analysing the available literature revealed that indications for N limitation of methane consumption have been reported in a variety of lowland soils, upland soils, and sediments. Obviously, depriving methane-oxidising bacteria of a suitable source of N hampers their growth and activity. However, an almost instantaneous link between the presence of mineral nitrogen (i.e. ammonium, nitrate) and methane-oxidising activity, as found in rice soils and culture experiments, requires an alternative explanation. We propose that switching from mineral N assimilation to the fixation of molecular nitrogen may explain this phenomenon. However, there is as yet no experimental evidence for any mechanism of instantaneous stimulation, since most studies have assumed that nitrogenous fertiliser is inhibitory of methane oxidation in soils and have focused only on this aspect. Nitrogen as essential factor on the sink side of the global methane budget has been neglected, leading to erroneous interpretation of methane emission dynamics, especially from wetland environments. The purpose of this minireview is to summarise and balance the data on the regulatory role of nitrogen in the consumption of methane by soils and sediments, and thereby stimulate the scientific community to embark on experiments to close the existing gap in knowledge. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of the Federation of European Microbiological Societies.","Ammonia oxidation; FD, ferredoxin; Fertilization; Inhibition; Methane emission; Methane oxidation; MMO, methane monooxygenase; Sediment; Soil; Wetland","ammonia; fertilizer; methane; nitrate; nitrogen; methane; microorganism; nitrogen; oxidation; agriculture; article; atmosphere; bacterial growth; bacterium culture; fertilizer application; microbial activity; microcosm; nonhuman; oxidation; priority journal; regulatory mechanism; sediment; soil analysis; soil fertility; wetland",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542301490

The identity of the gene was confirmed by a high degree of homology of the derived amino acid sequence to that of α-glucosidases from different sources. The gene activity is regulated by carbon source. In media supplemented with sucrose induction of the AINV gene and accumulation of the encoded invertase in the medium was observed. In addition the extracellular enzyme level is influenced by the morphological status of the organism, with mycelia secreting the enzyme in titres higher than those observed in budding yeasts. The enzyme characteristics were analysed from isolates of native strains as well as from those of recombinant strains expressing the AINV gene under control of the strong A. adeninivorans-derived TEF1 promoter. For both proteins a molecular mass of 600 kDa was determined, a pH optimum at pH 4.5 and a temperature optimum at 55 °C. The preferred substrates for the enzyme included the β-D-fructofuranosides sucrose, inulin and raffinose. Only a weak enzyme activity was observed for the α-D-glucopyranosides maltotriose, maltose and isomaltose. Thus the invertase primarily is a β-fructosidase and not an α-glucosidase as suggested by the homology to such enzymes. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","AINV; Arxula adeninivorans; Dimorphism; Invertase; Thermoresistance; Yeast","alpha glucosidase; amino acid; beta fructofuranosidase; carbon; glucopyranoside; inulin; isomaltose; maltose; maltotriose; raffinose; sucrose; genetic analysis; yeast; amino acid sequence; animal cell; article; Arxula adeninivorans; Ascomycetes; carbon source; controlled study; culture medium; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; enzyme purification; enzyme release; enzyme substrate; fungal morphology; fungal strain; fungus isolation; gene activity; gene expression; gene induction; gene isolation; gene sequence; genetic analysis; genetic code; genetic regulation; immunoblotting; molecular weight; mycelium; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; pH; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; promoter region; pulsed field gel electrophoresis; sequence homology; temperature; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Antibodies, Fungal; Base Sequence; beta-Fructofuranosidase; DNA, Fungal; Gene Expression; Genes, Fungal; Molecular Sequence Data; Molecular Weight; Plasmids; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Rabbits; Recombinant Proteins; Restriction Mapping; Saccharomycetales; Substrate Specificity; Arxula; Arxula adeninivorans; Saccharomycetales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043133151

This paper uses an intertemporal multi-region computable general equilibrium model of the world economy to assess the economics of ""Contraction and Convergence"" (C&amp;C). Upon comparing a regime of tradable and non-tradable emission rights for implementing C&amp;C, we find that international emissions trading increases crucially the political feasibility of the C&amp;C proposal. The reason is that the distribution of the total efficiency gains from permit trading not only improves the economic well-being of all regions as compared to strictly domestic action, but in particular raises economic welfare of major opponents to carbon restrictions from the developing world even beyond non-abatement baseline levels. A decomposition of the general equilibrium effects associated with C&amp;C shows that changes in the terms of trade constitute a key determinant of the overall welfare effects. © 2004 Society for Policy Modeling.

E., Garching, Germany","X-ray observations of Seyfert galaxies and quasars currently provide the most powerful way to study the environments of supermassive black holes. Our ability to probe these environments, some of the most extreme found in nature, is rapidly improving driven by dramatic advances in X-ray spectroscopic instrumentation. In addition to the well known 'hard X-ray power law' that is probably formed in a hot 'corona' above a cooler accretion disc, substantial spectral complexity has also been revealed. For example, soft X-ray excess emission above the power law is often seen at low X-ray energies, and this emission is thought to be associated with the inner disc. Atomic absorption/emission processes in nuclear gas flows are also observed to imprint characteristic features on X-ray spectra. Iron Kα emission lines from 6.40-6.97 keV are formed at least partially by fluorescence in the inner disc, and absorption edges seen mainly below 2 keV reveal major flows of ionized gas in the nucleus. Studies of the complex X-ray spectra of Seyferts and quasars have undergone a revolution wit the launches of Chandra in 1998 and XMM-Newton in 1999. The era of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy has been initiated by the Chandra and XMM-Newton grating spectrometers. These detectors provide X-ray spectra with 6-100 times higher spectral resolution than those previously available, and they have dramatically enlarged the arsenal of diagnostics available for investigating Seyfert/quasar nuclei. The new generation of X-ray observatories is used to intensively address some of the leading questions about Seyfert/quasar X-ray emission. Some of the most important scientific issues for the next years are: - Matter under strong gravity: Why are relativistically blurred Fe K lines so rare? - What are the extreme X-ray spectral and variability properties of ultrasoft Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxies telling us about Seyferts and quasars more generally? - What is the physical nature of the sharp spectral cut-off in Seyfert galaxies? While the advances expected from the new generation of X-ray observatories are so large and widespread that precise predictions are difficult, it is believed that particularly important progress will be made towards answering these central questions. Below is explained why the questions I have stated are fundamental and timely.","Active galaxies: X-rays; Strong gravity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12844283499

It is a intermediate step leading up to the next phase of the Global Soil Wetness Project (GSWP) (Phase 2), for which there will be a broader investigation of the aggregation between global scales (GSWP-1) and the river scale. This project makes use of the Rhône modeling system, which was developed in recent years by the French research community in order to study the continental water cycle on a regional scale. The main goals of this study are to investigate how 15 LSSs simulate the water balance for several annual cycles compared to data from a dense observation network consisting of daily discharge from over 145 gauges and daily snow depth from 24 sites, and to examine the impact of changing the spatial scale on the simulations. The overall evapotranspiration, runoff, and monthly change in water storage are similarly simulated by the LSSs, however, the differing partitioning among the fluxes results in very different river discharges and soil moisture equilibrium states. Subgrid runoff is especially important for discharge at the daily timescale and for smallerscale basins. Also, models using an explicit treatment of the snowpack compared better with the observations than simpler composite schemes. Results from a series of scaling experiments are examined for which the spatial resolution of the computational grid is decreased to be consistent with large-scale atmospheric models. The impact of upscaling on the domain-averaged hydrological components is similar among most LSSs, with increased evaporation of water intercepted by the canopy and a decrease in surface runoff representing the most consistent inter-LSS responses. A significant finding is that the snow water equivalent is greatly reduced by upscaling in all LSSs but one that explicitly accounts for subgrid-scale orography effects on the atmospheric forcing.",,"Agglomeration; Computer simulation; Evapotranspiration; Hydrology; Moisture; Runoff; Snow; Soil testing; Continental water cycle; Orography; Climatology; evapotranspiration; hydrological regime; land surface; river discharge; soil water; water budget",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10744232755

The methane and methane gas hydrate are predominantly biogenic, apparently produced by CO2 reduction. Reflection seismics indicate that bottom-simulating reflectors (BSRs) enclose ∼ 55,000 km2, with high-amplitude BSRs covering ∼ 26,000 km2. Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) Leg 164 drilled three deep holes on a 10-km-long transect (Sites 994, 995, and 997; water depth 2770-2798 m). Based on sampling and geochemical, thermal, seismic, and borehole geophysical measurements, gas hydrates are most likely present between ∼ 190 and 450 m in sediment column. Gas hydrate is most often disseminated throughout the sediment column, although concentrations occur within specific sedimentary horizons, within supposed fault zones, and at the base of gas hydrate stability (BGHS) where methane recycling produces more pervasive concentrations of gas hydrate. Estimates of gas hydrate inventory are based on a variety of methods including geochemical proxies, vertical seismic profiling, electric logging, and measurements of in situ methane. Over the entire sediment column, at least ∼ 2-4% of pore space volume (1-2% sediment volume) is occupied by methane gas hydrates, but average and maximum estimates are 5.4% and 12%, respectively. Extrapolation of vertical gas hydrate and methane inventory over the area containing high-amplitude BSRs yields estimates of 67-406 Gt (gigatons, 1015 g) of methane gas hydrate (or 9-52 Gt of methane) and 2.6-27 Gt of methane occurring as gas bubbles below the BGHS. Average values are 185 Gt of gas hydrate and 24 Gt of methane as gas hydrate. Any gas hydrate occurring outside the area underlain by BSRs (as suggested by geochemical evidence) or that associated with low-amplitude BSRs may increase these estimates by an unknown factor. Various data give conflicting pictures of mass transport with Blake Ridge sediments. The data can be reconciled by viewing the upper sedimentary section (&lt; ∼ 150 m) as dominated by diffusion, and the lower section characterized by buoyant advection (migration) of gaseous methane with both modes of transport overprinting generally low rates of pore-fluid movement (∼ 20 cm kyear-1). Methane migration seems necessary to produce observed gas hydrate distribution and inventory estimates. Accumulation of gas hydrate in the Blake Ridge sediments depends on the amount of methane leaving the system versus the amount of methane entering the gas hydrate stability zone (GHSZ) over geologic time. Although there are some point sources of methane loss from the sediments (e.g., seafloor seeps, ODP Site 996) of unknown magnitude, most of the documented methane loss occurs through diffusion and consumption at the sulfate-methane interface (SMI) by anaerobic methane oxidation (AMO; ∼ 2 × 108 mol year-1). Methane entering the GHSZ at a rate of ∼ 1.3 × 109 mol year-1 indicates a methane-trapping efficiency of ∼ 85%. 129I measurements suggest that the Blake Ridge system has accumulated gas hydrate over as much as 55 million years. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Analysis of carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ 18O) isotope ratios on a suite of planktonic and benthic foraminifera reveals rapid changes in surface and intermediate water circulation over the last 30 kyr. During the Last Glacial Maximum, there was a large δ13C offset (1.1‰) between the surface-dwelling planktonic foraminifera and benthic species living within the AAIW. In contrast, during the last deglaciation (Termination 1), the δ13Cplanktonic-benthic offset reduced to 0.4‰ prior to an intermediate offset (0.7‰) during the Holocene. We suggest that variations in the dominance and direction of AAIW circulation in the Tasman Sea, and increased oceanic ventilation, can account for the rapid change in the water column δ13Cplanktonic-benthic offset during the glacial-interglacial transition. Our results support the hypothesis that intermediate water plays an important role in propagating climatic changes from the polar regions to the tropics. In this case, climatic variations in the Southern Hemisphere may have led to the rapid ventilation of deep water and AAIW during Termination 1, which contributed to the postglacial rise in atmospheric CO2.

To investigate propofol-induced ventilatory depression in the clinically important range (at and below the metabolic hyperbola while carbon dioxide is accumulating because of drug-induced ventilatory depression), the authors applied indirect effect modeling to PaCO2 data at a fraction of inspired carbon dioxide of 0 during and after administration of propofol. Methods: Ten volunteers underwent determination of their carbon dioxide responsiveness by a rebreathing design. The parameters of a power function were fitted to the end-expiratory carbon dioxide and minute ventilation data. The volunteers then received propofol in a stepwise ascending pattern with use of a target-controlled infusion pump until significant ventilatory depression occurred (end-tidal pressure of carbon dioxide &gt; 65 mmHg and/or imminent apnea). Thereafter, the concentration was reduced to 1 μg/ml. Propofol pharmacokinetics and the PaCO2 were determined from frequent arterial blood samples. An indirect response model with Bayesian estimates of the pharmacokinetics and carbon dioxide responsiveness in the absence of drug was used to describe the PaCO2 time course. Because propofol reduces oxygen requirements and carbon dioxide production, a correction factor for propofol-induced decreasing of carbon dioxide production was included. Results: The following pharmacodynamic parameters were found to describe the time course of hypercapnia after administration of propofol (population mean and interindividual variability expressed as coefficients of variation): F (gain of the carbon dioxide response), 4.37 ± 36.7%; ke0, CO2, 0.95 min-1 ± 59.8%; baseline PaCO2, 40.9 mmHg ± 12.8%; baseline minute ventilation, 6.45 l/min ± 36.3%; ke1, CO2, 0.11 min-1 ± 34.2%; C50,propofol, 1.33 μg/ml ± 49.6%; γ, 1.68 ± 21.3%. Conclusion: Propofol at common clinical concentrations is a potent ventilatory depressant. An indirect response model accurately described the magnitude and time course of propofol-induced ventilatory depression. The indirect response model can be used to optimize propofol administration to reduce the risk of significant ventilatory depression.",,"carbon dioxide; propofol; apnea; arterial blood; article; Bayes theorem; blood sampling; breathing; controlled study; drug blood level; drug disposition; drug effect; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; experimental model; human; human experiment; hypotension; infusion pump; normal human; parameter; priority journal; rebreathing; respiration depression; steady state; Adult; Bayes Theorem; Carbon Dioxide; Female; Humans; Hypnotics and Sedatives; Male; Models, Biological; Propofol; Pulmonary Gas Exchange; Respiratory Insufficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642458343

We investigate the sensitivity of local climate to these land cover changes as observed from Landsat images acquired between 1975 and 1999. The Simple Biosphere model (SiB2) is used to assess the effects of both morphological and physiological changes in vegetation and the implications for fluxes of water, energy and carbon between the vegetation and the atmosphere during the rainy season. Conversion from tropical forest to cropland implicates morphological changes in vegetation as the primary drivers for a daily maximum warming of about 2°C and a slight nighttime cooling, suggesting that clearing of tropical forests for agricultural use may increase the diurnal temperature range, mainly by increasing the maximum temperature. On the other hand, the conversion of wooded grassland to cropland resulted in a similar daily warming and drying but exclusively due to vegetation physiological activity. The area-averaged monthly mean response for each conversion type resulted in a warming of about 0.6°C for the conversion of broadleaf evergreen and 1.2°C for conversion of wooded grassland. These temperature differences represent an augmentation in the local heat source associated with a reduction in evapotranspiration due to land cover conversion and do not reflect variations forced by changes in atmospheric circulation. When averaged over the entire domain, the effect of landscape conversion results in a reduction of the latent heat flux and an increase in sensible heat flux, producing a large-scale apparent heat source of 0.5°C during January. This warming is in line with an increasing trend observed in monthly mean temperature in Santa Cruz, Bolivia during the same period. © Springer-Verlag 2003.",,"atmosphere-biosphere interaction; deforestation; land use change; latent heat flux; regional climate; sensible heat flux; Bolivia; Santa Cruz [Bolivia]; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442630495

However, the fate of the carbon fixed by these blooms, and how efficiently it is exported into the ocean's interior, remains largely unknown. Here we report on the decline and fate of an iron-stimulated diatom bloom in the Gulf of Alaska. The bloom terminated on day 18, following the depletion of iron and then silicic acid, after which mixed-layer particulate organic carbon (POC) concentrations declined over six days. Increased particulate silica export via sinking diatoms was recorded in sediment traps at depths between 50 and 125 m from day 21, yet increased POC export was not evident until day 24. Only a small proportion of the mixed-layer POC was intercepted by the traps, with more than half of the mixed-layer POC deficit attributable to bacterial remineralization and mesozooplankton grazing. The depletion of silicic acid and the inefficient transfer of iron-increased POC below the permanent thermocline have major implications both for the biogeochemical interpretation of times of greater iron supply in the geological past, and also for proposed geoengineering schemes to increase oceanic carbon sequestration.",,"Biochemical engineering; Carbon; Iron; Mineralogy; Phytoplanktons; Sinking diatoms; Plants (botany); iron; organic carbon; silicic acid; silicon dioxide; carbon; iron; sea water; carbon cycle; fertilizer application; iron; phytoplankton; seawater; article; biogeochemistry; carbon sequestration; concentration (parameters); controlled study; diatom; engineering; geology; iron depletion; microbial activity; mineralization; nonhuman; particulate matter; phytoplankton; priority journal; recording; sediment; stimulation; United States; cold climate; growth, development and aging; metabolism; microbiology; physiology; sea; time; Bacillariophyta; Bacteria (microorganisms); Alaska; Carbon; Cold Climate; Diatoms; Iron; Oceans and Seas; Phytoplankton; Seawater; Silicic Acid; Silicon Dioxide; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144353699

The system includes the choice of 32 different insertion cassettes for genetic engineering purposes, such as gene disruption and more sophisticated insertions of reporter genes, heterologous promoters or combinations of the two. PCR-amplified flanking sequences needed for homologous recombination are ligated to the respective insertion cassettes via Sfi I sites. As proof of principle we generated two replacement mutants in which the endogenous promoter of the pheromone gene mfa1 drives expression of the Green Fluorescent Protein gene (gfp). Simultaneously, expression of the mfa1 ORF is controlled either by the carbon source-regulated crg1 promoter or the nitrogen source-regulated nar1 promoter. In both cases gfp expression was pheromone-inducible and pheromone expression was only detected when the heterologous promoters were active.","Gene replacement; Knock out/knock in; Mating factor; Regulated gene expression; Ustilago maydis","carbon; green fluorescent protein; nitrogen; pheromone; article; Crg1 gene; deletion mutant; DNA flanking region; gene; gene amplification; gene cassette; gene disruption; gene expression; gene insertion; genetic analysis; genetic engineering; mfa1 gene; nar1gene; nonhuman; open reading frame; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; promoter region; reporter gene; Ustilago maydis; Fungi; insertion sequences; Ustilago; Ustilago maydis; Ustilago maydis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5644228880

This has made intensity-modulated electron and photon beams as powerful as today's uniform dose proton therapy. To be able to cure also the most advanced hypoxic and radiation-resistant tumors of complex local spread, intensity-modulated light ion beams are really the ultimate tool and in clinical practice 2 to 3 times less expensive per patient treated than proton therapy. This development and the recent development of advanced tumor diagnostics based on PET-CT imaging of the tumor cell density open the field for new powerful radiobiologically based treatment optimization methods. The ultimate step is to use the unique radiobiologic and dose distributional advantages of light ion beams for truly optimized bioeffect planning where the integral three-dimensional dose delivery and tumor cell survival can be monitored by PET-CT imaging and corrected by biologically based adaptive therapy optimization methods. Purpose: The main purpose of the present paper is to discuss the principal areas of development of therapy optimization, by considering the therapy chain from tumor diagnostics and the use of three-dimensional predictive assay to biologically based treatment optimization with special focus on the rapid clinical development of advanced light ion therapy. Methods: Besides the ""classical"" approaches using low ionization density hydrogen ions (protons, but also possibly deuterons and tritium nuclei) and high ionization density carbon ions, two new approaches will be discussed. In the first one, lithium or beryllium or boron ions, which induce the least detrimental biologic effect to normal tissues for a given biologic effect in a small volume of the tumor, will be key particles. In the second approach, referred patients will be given a high-dose, high-precision ""boost"" treatment with carbon or oxygen ions during 1 week preceding the final treatment with conventional radiation in the referring hospital. The rationale behind these approaches is to minimize the high ionization density dose to the normal-tissue stroma outside but sometimes also inside the tumor bed and to ensure a more uniform and optimal biologic effectiveness in the tumor, also on the microscopic scale. The present discussion indicates that BIologically Optimized predictive Assay based light ion Radiation Therapy (Bio-Art) is really the ultimate way to perform high-precision radiation therapy using checkpoints of the integral dose delivery and the tumor response and, based on this information, perform compensating corrections of the dose delivery. By using biologically optimized scanned high-energy photon or ion beams, it is possible to measure in vivo the three-dimensional dose delivery using the same PET-CT camera that was used for diagnosing the tumor spread. This method thus opens up the door for truly three-dimensional biologically optimized adaptive radiation therapy, where the measured dose delivery to the true target tissues can be used to fine-adjust the incoming beams, so that possible errors in the integral therapy process are eliminated toward the end of the treatment. Interestingly enough, practically all major error sources - such as organ motion, treatment planning errors, patient setup errors, and dose delivery problems due to gantry, multileaf, or scanning beam errors - can be corrected for in this way. Results and Conclusions: Radiobiologically optimized dose delivery using intensity and radiation quality modulation based on high-resolution PET-CT or Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging (MRSI)-based tumor and normal-tissue imaging is probably the ultimate development of radiation therapy, taking the unique physical and biologic advantages of light ions fully into account in truly patient-individualized curative treatment schedules. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.","Electron beams; Light ion therapy; Photon beams; Radiation therapy","Cameras; Cells; Optimization; Patient monitoring; Photons; Tumors; Light ion radiation therapy; Radiotherapy; beryllium; boron; carbon; carbon 11; deuterium; lithium ion; proton; tritium; adaptive radiation; algorithm; apoptosis; cancer diagnosis; cancer invasion; cancer radiotherapy; cell cycle; cell survival; computer assisted tomography; conference paper; cost effectiveness analysis; electron; human; in vivo study; ionizing radiation; light ion radiation therapy; metastasis; microscopy; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; positron emission tomography; prediction; priority journal; radiation dose; radiobiology; three dimensional imaging; treatment outcome; treatment planning; tumor cell; tumor volume",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0742289163

New Haven: Yale University Press], which suggested that a coalition of environmentalists and industrialists successfully lobbied the US Congress. More strict technology-based standards for new emitting sources than for existing sources was the resulting policy outcome serving the common interest of the coalition because it offered both a barrier to entry for new firms and improved environmental quality. We focus on the case of international climate negotiations and the promotion of wind-based energy. Along the lines of the Ackerman and Hassler approach, we suggest that one reason for EU eagerness to push forward ambitious reduction target levels (and thereby promote new green industries) could be a similar coalition between industrialists and environmentalists. Such a strategy can be seen in the context of the Bootleggers and Baptist theory developed by Yandle ['Bootleggers and Baptists: the Education of a Regulatory Economist,' Regulation, 7, 12-16], where the Baptists (in our case the environmentalists) demand changes in behaviour on moral grounds. In contrast, the Bootleggers (the producers of renewable energy), who profit from the very regulation, keep a low profile. The actual heavy subsidisation of renewable energy sources, such as wind energy, can be viewed as a successful policy outcome for the coalition of industrialists and environmentalists offering both market protection and improved environmental quality. Solving the current dead-lock in international climate negotiations may well imply fighting the strong coalition of industrialists and environmentalists. Such a political battle may turn out to be just as tough as fighting windmills and needs to be addressed in future and more rigorous empirical research. At the end of the day, transparent incentives of relevant stakeholders in the climate change issue are necessary preconditions for progress in the climate change negotiations.","Baptists; Bootleggers; EU; Kyoto Protocol; Political economy; Technology-based standards; US; Windmill industry","alternative energy; climate change; environmental issue; wind power; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13644284572

[(C5H4)SiMe2(N-t-Bu)]ZrCl 2, 1, [(C9H6)SiMe2(N-t-Bu)]ZrCl 2, 2, and [(C5Me4)SiMe2(N-i-Pr)] ZrCl2, 3, were prepared in two steps, with ligand chelation accomplished by an amine elimination reaction followed by treatment of the diamido Zr intermediate with an excess of SiMe3Cl. X-ray structural analyses reveal that in the solid state 2 is monomeric, whereas 1 and 3 are centrosymmetric dimers linked by a pair of bridging chlorides. The level of asymmetry displayed by the central Zr2(μ-Cl)2 moiety is indicated by the variation in the pair of independent bridging Zr-Cl bond distances, which are 2.618(1) and 2.657(1) Å in 1 and 2.542(1) and 2.745(1) Å in 3, respectively.

Regional climate projections are based on a 1 percent per year CO2 increase relative to late 20th Century CO2 conditions. Two global projections of this CO2 increase scenario are considered (HadCM2 and PCM) during two future periods (2010 to 2039 and 2050 to 2079). HadCM2 projects faster warming than PCM. HadCM2 and PCM project wetter and drier conditions, respectively, relative to present climate. In the HadCM2 case, there would be increased reservoir inflows, increased storage limited by existing capacity, and increased releases for deliveries and river flows. In the PCM case, there would be decreased reservoir inflows, decreased storage and releases, and decreased deliveries. Impacts under either projection case cannot be regarded as more likely than the other. Most of the impacts uncertainty is attributable to the divergence in the precipitation projections. The range of assessed impacts is too broad to guide selection of mitigation projects. Regional planning agencies can respond by developing contingency strategies for these cases and applying the methodology herein to evaluate a broader set of CO2 scenarios, land use projections, and operational assumptions. Improved agency access to climate projection information is necessary to support this effort.","California; Climate change; Reservoir operations; Snowpack","Flow of water; Precipitation (meteorology); Regional planning; Reservoirs (water); Rivers; Water resources; California; Regional climate projections; River flows; Climate change; climate change; forecasting method; reservoir; river basin; water resource; California; North America; San Joaquin Basin; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842422852

Output from a tailored NCAR Community Climate Model version 3 (CCM3) simulation of the LGM climate is used to provide the initial and lateral boundary conditions for Polar MM5. LGM boundary conditions include continental ice sheets, appropriate orbital forcing, reduced CO2 concentration, paleovegetation, modified sea surface temperatures, and lowered sea level. Polar MM5 produces a substantially different atmospheric response to the LGM boundary conditions than CCM3 and other recent GCM simulations. In particular, from November to April the upper-level flow is split around a blocking anticyclone, over the LIS, with a northern branch over the Canadian Arctic and a southern branch impacting southern North America. The split flow pattern is most pronounced in January and transitions into a single, consolidated jet stream that migrates northward over the LIS during summer. Sensitivity experiments indicate that the winter split flow in Polar MM5 is primarily due to mechanical forcing by LIS, although model physics and resolution also contribute to the simulated flow configuration. Polar MM5 LGM results are generally consistent with proxy climate estimates in the western United States, Alaska, and the Canadian Arctic and may help resolve some long-standing discrepancies between proxy data and previous simulations of the LGM climate. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Boundary conditions; Climate change; Computer simulation; Estimation; Flow patterns; Ice; Jets; Optimization; Sea level; Vegetation; Annual cycles; Atmospheric circulation; Sea surface temperature (SST); Winter; Climatology; atmospheric circulation; climate modeling; general circulation model; Last Glacial Maximum; Laurentide Ice Sheet; paleoclimate; winter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5444269103

Yet because human-induced climate change will most hurt the poorest on the planet, seriously reduce the quality of life for future generations, and threaten plants and animals around the world, global warming must be understood to raise very serious ethical issues. In fact, because global warming policy options will likely determine which people, plants and animals will live and die, human-induced climate change must be understood to raise the most momentous ethical dilemma. This is particularly the case because those who currently emit the most greenhouse gases are not likely those who will be most harmed by global warming. Yet despite the profound ethical questions raised by global warming, most of the debate in the United States and many other nations has been concerned with issues such as scientific certainty about global warming impacts and economic cost of climate change programs, arguments that pretend to be ethically neutral but often hide dubious ethical positions. For instance, if a nation refuses to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions until science can describe global warming impacts with high levels of confidence, such nation is implicitly asking the victim of global warming to bear the burden of risk in light of the fact that harm may be experienced before scientific uncertainties are resolved. For this reason, insisting on high levels of scientific proof before ceasing high-risk behavior is an ethical question often hidden in arguments about science.",,"environmental issue; environmental policy; ethics; global warming; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942694296

The contributors examine issues including electricity restructuring in the wake of the August 2003 blackout, the implications of the Bush Administration’s energy policies, energy security, northern pipelines and Aboriginal energy issues, provincial changes in energy policy, and overall federal-provincial changes in regulatory governance. They also demonstrate that, since per capita energy usage has actually increased in the past several years, sustainable development remains very much a struggle rather than an achievement. When the Kyoto Protocol and its requirements for reductions in greenhouse gas emissions are factored in, the Canadian record is especially dubious in basic energy terms.

The semivolatile organic compounds may disperse into the atmosphere by direct input from several sources such as the burning of fossil fuels, from motor vehicle emissions, and forest fires. Once in the atmosphere, they may travel great distances before being deposited to the earth's surface by the scavenging action of rain and snow. Up to 14 PAHs were determined in wet precipitation samples collected monthly from five sites in the four Canadian Atlantic Provinces during 1980-2001, The relatively more volatile PAHs (phenanthrene, fluoranthene, naphthalene, and pyrene) were predominant in the samples. Significant (P &lt; 0.05) spatial variations in the deposition of some PAHs were observed among sites, but there were no consistent geographic patterns. Seasonal patterns were discernible with peak deposition for ∑ 6&amp;14 PAHs occurring during the colder months of the year (December to March) and coinciding with higher energy consumption for heating and transport. The monthly volume weighed mean concentration for ∑ 6 PAHs has declined steadily since the mid-1980s at Kejimkujik National Park in southwest Nova Scotia, with a calculated half-life of 6.4 ± 0.3 years. The maximum annual deposition flux of 20 μg m -2 yr-1 reached in 1985 for ∑6 PAHs decreased approximately 1 order of magnitude by the year 2000. The decrease in ∑6&amp;14 PAHs for the region was found to be correlated (P &lt; 0.05) with decreasing sulfate ion concentrations in the precipitation.

These benefits mainly come from the possibility to locally recover waste heat from exhaust gas especially for air conditioning thermally activated technologies and also for their capability to use low heating value gases such digester gas. This paper summarises the potential of micro gas turbines in distributed generation systems to simultaneously produce power, heat and chilled water for air conditioning. Different configurations for coupling micro gas turbines and sorption systems will be presented from the conventional hot water driven to the directly exhaust gas driven configurations. The main advantage of these systems is the consumption of waste heat for refrigeration and air conditioning instead of high cost electricity. On the other hand the use of digester and landfill gas in micro gas turbines is very attractive from many points of view: Reduced electrical bill, higher energy efficiency due to on-site heat recovery, reduction of odours and lower greenhouse emissions. The processing of pig manure to produce biogas is of high interest in geographic areas with a surplus of manure that can not be naturally absorbed and limits the growth of farm sites.

The recent discovery of a mutation in dogs illuminates the complexity of this disorder in veterinary medicine. The good news is that most clinical MHS events are mild and nonlethal. The bad news is that the recognized clinical cases of MH are only the tip of the iceberg. Veterinarians need to increase the vigilance and level of monitoring of anesthetized animals so as to diagnose these disorders. The use of ETco2 and core body temperature monitoring enables diagnosis and treatment. Elevations in carbon dioxide and body temperature need not be excessive to indicate an MHS reaction. Cases in which carbon dioxide is persistently elevated despite aggressive ventilatory support and core body temperature elevates during general anesthesia should be viewed as positive MH cases until proven to the contrary. With appropriate treatment, complete recovery is expected. After an MH event, the animal should be able to return to normal activities and live a normal quality of life. Safe anesthetic techniques are available and are commonly used by veterinarians in private practice. Statistics indicate high mortality of anesthetized dogs, cats, and horses. As has been the history in human anesthesiology, anesthetic-related mortality can be reduced by the early recognition and treatment of MHS. In the future, identification of additional MHS-associated mutations should lead to better understanding of related neuromuscular diseases in our pets and in people. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Of highly variable intensity, while remaining persistently near local noon, a polar ""spot"" of aurora has been suggested to be associated with the jovian cusp. The main jovian X-ray source also appears to be colocated with this UV emission and is characteristically pulsed with a period of ∼45 min. Here we take up the suggestion that these emissions correspond to the cusp, i.e., where magnetosheath plasma gains entry to the jovian magnetosphere. We first observe that without acceleration, the largest precipitating energy fluxes are associated with magnetosheath protons, but these produce only ∼0.4-4 kR of UV emission, well below that which is observed (&gt;100 kR). Therefore acceleration must be present. We thus investigate the possibility that the UV and X-ray emissions are associated with pulsed reconnection at the dayside magnetopause, with an interpulse period estimated to be 40-50 min, hence providing a possible explanation for the pulsed X-ray signatures. Based upon the approximate bimodality of solar wind conditions at Jupiter, we have developed two conceptual models, ""slow"" and ""fast"" flow models corresponding to low and high values of the interplanetary magnetic field strength, respectively, of the twin-vortical flows which occur as a result of pulsed dayside reconnection, and the bipolar field-aligned currents which are also present. We find that peak field-aligned currents due to the vortical flows in the two models are ∼1.15 and 8.13 μA m-2, respectively, for the slow and fast models. We subsequently consider conditions under which magnetospheric and cusp particle populations can carry these field-aligned currents, by estimating the field-aligned voltages which will be present and the energy fluxes and auroral output which results. Although the details depend upon the model assumptions, for the slow flow model the reconnection pulses produce two adjacent bright (&gt;100 kR) ""spots"" or ""arcs"" of emission of order a few 1000 km along the open-closed field line boundary and a few 100 km wide, separated by a few 1000 km, comparable with observations. The X-ray emission in this slow flow scenario is negligible due to low voltages associated with the flow vortices. In the fast flow model, overall, the emission takes the form of an intense ∼10 MR arc extending ∼10,000 km along the open-closed field line boundary, with a ""gap"" between electron and ion contributions. We also find that in this case magnetospheric O2+ in the region of the downward currents is accelerated sufficiently to produce X-rays, with intensities ∼few kR and peak power outputs of a few GW, in good agreement with observations.

Phospholipid fatty acid analysis was used to investigate the effect of two crop rotations (continuous maize and maize-crotalaria rotation) and P fertilization (0 and 50 kg Pha-1yr-1, applied as triple superphosphate) on microbial community composition in a highly weathered soil from western Kenya. Microbial substrate use in soils from the field experiment was compared in incubation experiments. Higher levels of soil organic matter and microbial biomass in the maize-crotalaria rotation were connected with higher total amounts of phospholipid fatty acids and an increase in the relative abundances of indicators for fungi and gram-negative bacteria. P fertilization changed the community profile only within the continuous maize treatment. The decomposition of glucose, cellulose and three plant residues (all added at 2.5 g Ckg -1 soil) proceeded faster in soil from the maize-crotalaria rotation, but differences were mostly transient. Microbial P and N uptake within one week increased with the water-soluble carbon content of added plant residues. More P and N were taken up by the greater microbial biomass in soil from the maize-crotalaria rotation than from continuous maize. Re-mineralization of nutrients during the decline of the microbial biomass increased also with the initial biological activity of the soil, but occurred only for a high quality plant residue within the half year incubation period. Compared to the effect of crop rotation, P fertilization had a minor effect on microbial community composition and substrate use. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In recent years bentgrass use has extended into the warmer climates of the southern United States. Being a C3 plant, bentgrass is not well adapted to extended hot and humid environmental conditions. Subsurface air movement systems are now commercially available that can transport air through the root zone to alter soil conditions and potentially improve bentgrass survival. This research investigated the effects of subsurface air movement on the composition of soil gases, matric potential, temperature, and growth response of a sand-based creeping bentgrass golf green. Treatments included: air movement direction (evacuate, inject, and no air) and duration of air movement (0400-0600 HR, 1000-1800 HR, and 24 hours). Treatment combinations were imposed for 13 days. Subsurface air movement reduced CO2 at the 9-cm depth to values &lt;0.0033 mol·mol-1 when evacuating or injecting air, depending upon duration. Soil matric potentials at a 9-cm depth were decreased by a maximum of 96% when evacuating air for 24-hour duration compared to no-air plots. Soil temperatures at 9 cm were decreased ≈1 to 1.5°C when injecting air from 1000 to 1800 HR and 24-hour treatments and increased ≈0.75°C when evacuating air from 1000 to 1800 HR. Subsurface air movement did not improve creeping bentgrass turf quality or rooting. Although not effective in improving the growth response of creeping bentgrass, subsurface air movement may be a useful tool to improve soil gas composition, reduce excess soil moisture, and potentially reduce soil temperature(s) of heat-stressed creeping bentgrass golf greens.","Agrostis palustris; Carbon dioxide (CO2); Creeping bentgrass; Golf greens; Oxygen (O2); Oxygen diffusion rate (ODR); Root growth; Soil gases; Turf quality","Air; Color; Creep; Gases; Sand; Soils; Textures; Thermal effects; Ball roll; Bentgrass; Subsurface air; Plants (botany); Agrostis; Agrostis palustris; Agrostis stolonifera var. palustris",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2042529308

Conventional seismic impedance inversion alone did not adequately predict porosity nor did neural network predictions with conventional seismic attributes. Spectral decomposition, seismic impedance inversion, and neural network inversion were integrated to produce an estimated porosity cube at the target level that provided excellent porosity indication in validation wells. The lateral variation of porosities within the area range from about 2% to more than 30%. Thus, the application of these techniques allowed final adjustment of drilling locations in order to capture the maximum local porosity possible. Resulting porosity maps within the field area are shown to have important implications for field development and further exploration in this area. This study defines a relationship between porosity thickness and peak frequency, and between the magnitude of the average effective zone porosity and peak amplitude. Additionally, the study illustrates the importance of training a neural network properly with (1) appropriate input attributes, and (2) utilization of wells which cover the spectrum of possible porosity encountered in the area. We show how such a methodology can be applied to carbonate reservoirs to distinguish locations with minimal to no effective porosity from areas with excellent porosity where additional development drilling can be fruitful. © 2004 Society of Exploration Geophysicists.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84956487901

The first has been conditioned by the requirements imposed by the software in terms of de-aggregated data, which were not available at first, and required estimation. Adequate models and algorithms were developed, establishing different hypotheses based on statistical criteria and on current literature. They provided the input data for COPERT III and constitute a result in themselves, offering reliable estimations on number of vehicles and other aspects. The final result of the study has been the estimates of the evolution of pollutant emissions during the period of study. A series for each particular pollutant has been obtained. Based on these results, the effects of the different regulations introduced and of the increase of mobility during the period can be observed qualitatively and quantitatively. Vehicle renewal, more strict regulation of fuel composition and of vehicle emissions have significantly reduced local, sulphur and lead-compound emissions, while mainly due to the increase in mobility, a sustained growth in global emissions has taken place. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

On a smaller spatial scale, regional climates of the late Quaternary exhibited fluctuations that were at times asynchronous to these global changes. For example, glacier expansion in the Himalayas during the mid-Holocene appears to be at odds with the notion of increased global temperature. A clear understanding of the dynamical processes governing regional climate is therefore essential to the correct interpretation of proxy climate data. We summarize results from numerical simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) and the mid-Holocene, and focus on the multiple processes that control regional climate of the Himalaya and surrounding areas, with emphasis on monsoon dynamics and variability. It is shown that changes in the south Asian monsoon (caused by fluctuations in Earth's orbital parameters, by tropical Pacific Ocean temperatures, or by exposure of the Sunda shelf) alter the hydrological balance in regions bordering the Tibetan Plateau, a balance for which there are extensive continental proxy records. Numerical results correlate with the expansion/contraction cycles of deserts near the Chinese Loess Plateau. In addition, the LGM monsoon exhibits significant snow accumulation in the eastern Himalaya, whereas the mid-Holocene monsoon exhibits increased accumulation in the northwestern Himalaya. Simulated changes are therefore in accord with field data and demonstrate that numerical simulations can be a useful tool in the interpretation of regional proxy data, particularly when those data are asynchronous to global records. © 2004 Taylor and Francis.",,"Holocene; paleoclimate; Pleistocene; Quaternary; Asia; Eurasia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442700028

Inst., SINOPEC, Beijing 100083, China","New sour pools have recently found in the Lower Triassic Feixianguan Fm carbonate reservoirs in the East Sichuan Basin in China with H2S up to 17.4% by volume. A recent blowout from a well drilled into this formation killed hundreds of people as a result of the percentage concentrations of H2S. In order to assess the origin of fatal H2S as well as the cause of petroleum alteration, H2S concentrations and the isotopes, δ34S and δ13C have been collected and measured in gas samples from reservoirs. Anhydrite, pyrite and elemental sulphur δ34S values have been measured for comparison. The high concentrations of H2S gas are found to occur at depths &gt;3000 m (temperature now at ∼100 °C) in evaporated platform facies oolitic dolomite or limestone that contains anhydrite nodule occurrence within the reservoirs. Where H2S concentrations are greater than 10% its δ34S values lie between +12.0 and +13.2‰ CDT. This is within the range of anhydrite δ34 S values found within the Feixianguan Fm (+11.0 to +21.7‰ average 15.5±3.5‰ CDT). Thus H2S must have been generated by thermochemical sulphate reduction (TSR) locally within the reservoirs. Burial history analysis and fluid inclusion data reveal that the temperature at which TSR occurred was greater than about 130-140 °C, suggesting that the present depth-temperature minimum is an artifact of post-TSR uplift. Both methane and ethane were actively involved in TSR since the petroleum became almost totally dry (no alkanes except methane) and methane δ13C values become significantly heavier as TSR proceeded. Methane δ13C difference thus reflects the extent of TSR. While it is tempting to use a present-day depth control (&gt;3000 m) to predict the distribution of H2S in the Feixianguan Fm, this is an invalid approach since TSR occurred when the formation was buried some 1000-2000 m deeper than it is at present. The likelihood of differential uplift across the basin means that it is important to develop a basinal understanding of the thermal history of the Feixianguan Fm so that it is possible to determine which parts of the basin have been hotter than 130-140 °C. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Sequestration of carbon from atmospheric CO2, in extensive, cold organic soils and the high albedo from low, snow-covered vegetation have had impacts on regional climate. However, many aspects of the functioning of Arctic ecosystems are sensitive to changes in climate and its impacts on biodiversity. The current Arctic climate results in slow rates of organic matter decomposition. Arctic ecosystems therefore tend to accumulate organic matter and elements despite low inputs. As a result, soil-available elements like nitrogen and phosphorus are key limitations to increases in carbon fixation and further biomass and organic matter accumulation. Climate warming is expected to increase carbon and element turnover, particularly in soils, which may lead to initial losses of elements but eventual, slow recovery. Individual species and species diversity have clear impacts on element inputs and retention in Arctic ecosystems. Effects of increased CO2 and UV-B on whole ecosystems, on the other hand, are likely to be small although effects on plant tissue chemisty, decomposition and nitrogen fixation may become important in the long-term. Cycling of carbon in trace gas form is mainly as CO2 and CH4. Most carbon loss is in the form of CO2, produced by both plants and soil biota. Carbon emissions as methane from wet and moist tundra ecosystems are about 5% of emissions as CO2 and are responsive to warming in the absence of any other changes. Winter processes and vegetation type also affect CH4 emissions as well as exchanges of energy between biosphere and atmosphere. Arctic ecosystems exhibit the largest seasonal changes in energy exchange of any terrestrial ecosystem because of the large changes in albedo from late winter, when snow reflects most incoming radiation, to summer when the ecosystem absorbs most incoming radiation. Vegetation profoundly influences the water and energy exchange of Arctic ecosystems. Albedo during the period of snow cover declines from tundra to forest tundra to deciduous forest to evergreen forest. Shrubs and trees increase snow depth which in turn increases winter soil temperatures. Future changes in vegetation driven by climate change are therefore, very likely to profoundly alter regional climate.",,"arctic environment; carbon sequestration; climate change; ecosystem response; cellular organisms",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844225626

However, although our current understanding of ecological processes and changes driven by climate and UV-B is strong in some geographical areas and in some disciplines, it is weak in others. Even though recently the strength of our predictions has increased dramatically with increased research effort in the Arctic and the introduction of new technologies, our current understanding is still constrained by various uncertainties. The assessment is based on a range of approaches that each have uncertainties, and on data sets that are often far from complete. Uncertainties arise from methodologies and conceptual frameworks, from unpredictable surprises, from lack of validation of models, and from the use of particular scenarios, rather than predictions, of future greenhouse gas emissions and climates. Recommendations to reduce the uncertainties are wide-ranging and relate to all disciplines within the assessment. However, a repeated theme is the critical importance of achieving an adequate spatial and long-term coverage of experiments, observations and monitoring of environmental changes and their impacts throughout the sparsely populated and remote region that is the Arctic.",,"arctic environment; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem response; ultraviolet B radiation; Acia",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844222047

Segmentation results will be used to initialize a non-linear registration procedure between these complementary imaging modalities. Therefore, structures involved in the segmentation system must be visible in both CT and emission PET images in order to compute a spatial transformation between them. Thus, the chosen structures include lungs, kidneys and liver (skin and skeleton are also segmented as support structures). In the hierarchical segmentation procedure, the extraction of a given structure is driven by information derived from a simpler one. This information is composed of spatial constraints inferred from the previously segmented structures and expressed by means of Regions Of Interest (ROI) in which the search for new structures will take place. The segmentation of each structure follows a two-phase process: a first stage is composed of automatic thresholding and other low-level operations in the ROI defined by previously segmented objects; a second stage employs a 3D deformable model to refine and regularize results provided by the former step. Visual inspection by medical experts has stated that the proposed segmentation approach provides results which are accurate enough to guide a subsequent non-linear registration procedure. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Fluorescence spectroscopy has been proposed as a promising method for characterizing DOM, but few links have been demonstrated between DOM fluorescence and DOM composition or the processes affected by DOM composition. In 28 southern Québec lakes, tryptophan-like DOM fluorescence (T-FDOM) was found to be a much better descriptor of rates of heterotrophic bacterial metabolism than dissolved organic carbon, describing 52%, 44%, 51%, and 55% of the variability in bacterial production, bacterioplankton respiration, total bacterial carbon consumption, and total plankton community respiration, respectively. In addition, evidence from a series of bacterial regrowth cultures suggests that T-FDOM represents a product of bacterial activity as well as, to a lesser extent, a bioavailable substrate. Our results instead raise the intriguing possibility that T-FDOM concentration reflects a balance between its production and consumption by bacteria. We demonstrate here that fluorescence spectroscopy can be used to identify a highly dynamic fraction of DOM related to bacterial metabolism in lakes.",,"biological production; dissolved organic matter; fluorescence spectroscopy; heterotrophy; lake ecosystem; metabolism; Canada; North America; Quebec [Canada]; Western Hemisphere; World; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9244236054

Few studies have characterized both gaseous and PM emissions from individual in-use vehicles under real-world driving conditions. Here we describe chase vehicle studies in which on-road emissions from individual vehicles were measured in real time within seconds of their emission. This work uses an Aerodyne aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) to provide size-resolved and chemically resolved characterization of the nonrefractory portion of the emitted PM; refractory materials such as elemental carbon (EC) were not measured in this study. The AMS, together with other gas-phase and particle instrumentation, was deployed on the Aerodyne Research Inc. (ARI) mobile laboratory, which was used to ""chase"" the target vehicles. Tailpipe emission indices of the targeted vehicles were obtained by referencing the measured nonrefractory particulate mass loading to the instantaneous CO2 measured simultaneously in the plume. During these studies, nonrefractory PM1.0 (NRPM1) emission indices for a representative fraction of the New York City Metropolitan Transit Authority (MTA) bus fleet were determined. Diesel bus emissions ranged from 0.10 g NRPM1/kg fuel to 0.23 g NRPM1/kg, depending on the type of engine used by the bus. The average NRPM1 emission index of diesel-powered buses using Continuously Regenerating Technology (CRT™) trap systems was 0.052 g NRPM1/kg fuel. Buses fueled by compressed natural gas (CNG) had an average emission index of 0.034 g NRPM1/kg Fuel. The mass spectra of the nonrefractory diesel aerosol components measured by the AMS were dominated by lubricating oil spectral signatures. Mass-weighted size distributions of the particles in fresh diesel exhaust plumes peak at vacuum aerodynamic diameters around 90 nm with a typical full width at half maximum of 60 nm.",,"Environmental engineering; Gas dynamics; Ground vehicles; Mass spectrometry; Natural gas; Thermal plumes; Vacuum; Aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS); Particulate matter (PM); Urban environments; Atmospheric aerosols; aerosol; article; exhaust gas; mass spectrometry; motor vehicle; particle size; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; priority journal; United States; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342612959

Although many invaders completely eliminate native plant species from some communities, ecologists know little about the mechanisms by which these exotics competitively exclude other species. Mycorrhizal fungi radically alter competitive interactions between plants within natural communities, and a recent study has shown that arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi provide a substantial competitive advantage to spotted knapweed, Centaurea maculosa, a noxious perennial plant that has spread throughout much of the native prairie in the northwestern U.S. Here we present evidence that this advantage is potentially due to mycorrhizally mediated transfer of carbon from a native bunchgrass, Festuca idahoensis, to Centaurea. Centaurea maculosa, Festuca idahoensis (Idaho fescue, C3), and Bouteloua gracilis (blue gramma, C4) were grown in the greenhouse either alone or with Centaurea in an incomplete factorial design with and without AM fungi. Centaurea biomass was 87-168% greater in all treatments when mycorrhizae were present in the soil (P &lt; 0.0001). However, Centaurea biomass was significantly higher in the treatment with both mycorrhizae and Festuca present together than in any other treatment combination (P &lt; 0.0001). This high biomass was attained even though Centaurea photosynthetic rates were 14% lower when grown with Festuca and mycorrhizae together than when grown with Festuca without mycorrhizae. Neither biomass nor photosynthetic rates of Centaurea were affected by competition with the C4 grass Bouteloua either with or without mycorrhizae. The stable isotope signature of Centaurea leaves grown with Festuca and mycorrhizae was more similar to that of Festuca, than when Centaurea was grown alone with mycorrhizae (P = 0.06), or with Festuca but without mycorrhizae (P = 0.09). This suggests that carbon was transferred from Festuca to the invasive weed. We estimated that carbon transferred from Festuca by mycorrhizae contributed up to 15% of the aboveground carbon in Centaurea plants. Our results indicate that carbon parasitism via AM soil fungi may be an important mechanism by which invasive plants out compete their neighbors, but that this interaction is highly species-specific.","Arbuscular mycorrhizae; Bouteloua gracilis; Carbon transfer; Centaurea maculosa; Festuca idahoensis; Invasive weeds","arbuscular mycorrhiza; grass; interspecific competition; mycorrhiza; weed; Bouteloua; Bouteloua gracilis; Centaurea; Centaurea maculosa; Festuca; Festuca idahoensis; Fungi; Gramma",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3542997539

Cation exchange capacities and selectivity coefficients for Na +, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+ were measured in the laboratory using standard techniques. Selectivity coefficients were also determined using a method involving optimized back-calculation from flushing experiments, thus permitting better representation of field conditions; in all cases, the Gaines-Thomas/constant cation exchange capacity (CEC) model was found to be a reasonable, though not perfect, first description. The exchange parameters interpreted from the laboratory experiments were used in a one-dimensional reactive transport mixing cell model, and predictions compared with field pumping well data (Cl and hardness spanning a period of around 40 years, and full major ion analyses in ~1980). The concentration patterns predicted using Gaines-Thomas exchange with calcite equilibrium were similar to the observed patterns, but the concentrations of the divalent ions were significantly overestimated, as were 1980 sulphate concentrations, and 1980 alkalinity concentrations were underestimated. Including representation of sulphate reduction in the estuarine alluvium failed to replicate 1980 HCO 3 and pH values. However, by including partial CO2 degassing following sulphate reduction, a process for which there is 34S and 18O evidence from a previous study, a good match for SO4, HCO3, and pH was attained. Using this modified estuary water and averaged values from the laboratory ion exchange parameter determinations, good predictions for the field cation data were obtained. It is concluded that the Gaines-Thomas/constant exchange capacity model with averaged parameter values can be used successfully in ion exchange predictions in this aquifer at a regional scale and over extended time scales, despite the numerous assumptions inherent in the approach; this has also been found to be the case in the few other published studies of regional ion exchanging flow. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental research on this issue has been done using time of flight techniques which have characterized the specific charge of the extracted species, combined with stopping-potential energy analyses. We address this issue from the numerical perspective by developing a single emitter colloid simulation. In previous papers we have presented results from our numerical model for an axisymmetric colloidal jet [J.A. Carretero, M. Martínez-Sánchez, in: 38th Joint Propulsion Conf. and Exhibit, 7-10 July, 2002, Indianapolis, IN, AIAA-2002-3812, 2002; J.A. Carretero, M. Martínez-Sánchez, in: 28th Internat. Electric Propulsion Conf., 17-21 March, 2003, Toulouse France, 2003]. The numerical simulation models the cone-jet transition region of the colloid jet; starting from the needle to the extractor grid, thus reproducing the typical electrospray experimental configuration. The liquid is modelled as an incompressible viscous fluid with a constant conductivity. A Surface charge relaxation equation is included in the model, and the potential and electric fields in the fluid are solved for. The equations have been simplified by employing a slenderness approximation except for the free surface boundary conditions where the terms have been kept exact. Simulation results have been shown to compare well to experimental data for a variety of liquids, for flows 1 < √pK Q/(γ ε ε0) < 6. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The presence of a seasonality effect in regions with year-round warm climate, however, has rarely been examined. The major purpose of this project was to better understand if the seasonality effect on schizophrenic births that has been reported in other, mostly cold regions of the Northern Hemisphere, also can be detected in a warm, tropical climate. We set out to study birth months as risk factors, quantifying the risk for being born with schizophrenia for every month of the winter season in terms of incidence rate ratios (IRRs) in the central region of Puerto Rico. We also analyzed climatic data in order to determine if there was any correlation between the rate of schizophrenic births (n=710) to births in the general population (n=101,248) and average rainfall and temperature for every month of the year in our period of study (January 1932-December 1967). Our results suggest that the risk of developing schizophrenia is 36.5% higher for people born in February than for people born in the other months of the year (95% C.I.=6.6-74.8%). We also found correlations between the rate of schizophrenic to control births for any given month, and rainfall 4 months earlier (r=0.66, p=0.010), and temperature 5 months earlier (r=0.64, p=0.013) that remained significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

However, in order for CO2 fertilization to have an effect on carbon sequestration to the deep ocean, the increase in dissolved CO2 must stimulate primary productivity; that is, marine phototrophs must be CO2 limited [Riebesell et al., 1993]. Estimation of the extent of bicarbonate (HCO-3) uptake in the oceans is therefore required to determine whether the anthropogenic carbon sources will enhance carbon flux to the deep ocean. Using short-term 14CO2-disequilibrium experiments during the Southern Ocean Iron Experiment (SOFeX), we show that HCO-3 uptake by Southern Ocean phytoplankton is significant. Since the majority of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) in the ocean is in the form of bicarbonate, the biological pump may therefore be insensitive to anthropogenic CO2. Approximately half of the DIC uptake observed was attributable to direct HCO-3 uptake, the other half being direct CO2 uptake mediated either by passive diffusion or active uptake mechanisms. The increase in growth rates and decrease in CO2 concentration associated with the iron fertilization did not trigger any noticeable changes in the mode of DIC acquisition, indicating that under most environmental conditions the carbon concentrating mechanism (CCM) is constitutive. A low-CO2 treatment induced an increase in uptake of CO2, which we attributed to increased extracellular carbonic anhydrase activity, at the expense of direct HCO-3 transport across the plasmalemma. Isotopic disequilibrium experimental results are consistent with Southern Ocean carbon stable isotope fractionation data from this and other studies. Although iron fertilization has been shown to significantly enhance phytoplankton growth and may potentially increase carbon flux to the deep ocean, an important source of the inorganic carbon taken up by phytoplankton in this study was HCO-3, whose concentration is negligibly affected by the anthropogenic rise in CO2. We conclude that biological productivity in this region of the world's ocean is unlikely to be directly regulated by natural or anthropogenic variations in atmospheric CO2 concentrations because of the presence of a constitutive CCM.

The objective was to cover the needs of Argentina, excluding its southernmost tip, although the model may also be used for other regions with similar available data. The input for the model was conditioned by the climatic data edited by the National Meteorological Service of Argentina (mean weather variables over 10 years). The model's performance was tested for three cases. In Case 1, the mean monthly amount and occurrence of precipitation were both available. In Case 2, the mean monthly amount of precipitation was available, but the mean monthly occurrence of precipitation was available for a nearby weather station. In Case 3, only the monthly amount of precipitation was available. Calibration and validation of the model's algorithms was carried out using a wide range of climatic data from sites throughout the world and from all the available sites in Argentina with at least two decades of data covering the period 1950-1990. Use of the model was not recommended at sites near the Andes, beyond latitude 45°S and in Jujuy province. The excluded area represents less than 20% of Argentina's total surface area. Due to data availability, the full performance of the model was mainly evaluated in the province of Buenos Aires (the one with most engineering activity). At Bahía Blanca (in Buenos Aires province, 38°44′S, 62°10′W, Fig. 1) the model reliably reproduced the main features of precipitation required for agricultural, forestry and civil planning uses. In conclusion, the proposed model was very simple and fulfilled the objective of this work; furthermore, some of the results obtained could be extrapolated and applied for other regions. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The greenhouse area in northern Europe has been almost stable, while protected cultivation expanded enormously in the Mediterranean basin, enhanced by the enlarging demand of vegetables for the export and domestic markets, resulting from economic development. In the past, the production strategies in the Mediterranean greenhouse industries have been mainly related with the adaptation of the crops to a suboptimal environment, due to the limited greenhouse climate control. There is now a general trend to better equipped greenhouses with improved climate management, in order to increase product quality. Achieving an economic compromise between the higher costs of improved greenhouses and their increased agronomic production are requiring different solutions, according to the local technical and socio-economic conditions, in order to produce proper quality commodities at competitive levels, relative to the higher performances of the sophisticated glasshouse industry of northern European countries. The distance from the European markets, in export focused production, increases the transportation cost of Mediterranean production, limiting its competitiveness. The rise of the technological level in the ""Mediterranean greenhouse agrosystem"" includes diverse improvements related with greenhouse design and climate management, crop techniques and practices (cultivars, cycles, plant protection, irrigation, substrates,⋯) and market-oriented production strategies in the various conditions of the Mediterranean basin. The cultural level of the growers in different countries can be a limiting factor to improving the technological level of the greenhouses, and great efforts are being made to transfer this knowledge to the growers, providing them with the methodology of optimization of their production systems. © ISHS.","Climate; Costs; Equipment; Markets; Structure; Technological level",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12544250604

In the neutral regions behind the H II region, the radiation field produces a rich photochemistry on timescales shorter than the dynamical evolution of the central H II region, leading to the formation of large carbon-rich molecules C nH2, HC(2n+1)N, and Cn. Reactions between radicals H and H2 play a crucial role in maintaining a high abundance for these species in spite of the strong radiation field emerging from the central star. The models predict that proto-planetary nebulae in the early stages of evolution will have high abundances for species such as HC(2n+1)N, CnH4, and CnH3N. The role of reactions between neutrals and radicals in the growth of aromatic molecules is discussed. The large abundance derived for small cumulenes suggests that the growth of small carbon grains with C/H ≫ 1 could be dominated by reactions between polyynes and cumulenes. The models also explain the observed abundances of H2CO, OH, H 2O, CO2, and [O I] in the region where CO is photodissociated.","Astrochemistry; Molecular data; Molecular processes; Planetary nebulae: individual (CRL 618); Stars: AGB and post-AGB",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142777200

We analyzed the effects of the predominant land use change, conversion of tropical forest to pasture, on total soil C and N, using the Century ecosystem model and data collected from the Nova Vida ranch, Western Brazilian Amazon. We estimated equilibrium organic matter levels, plant productivity and residue carbon inputs under native forest conditions, then simulated deforestation following the slash and burn procedure. Soil organic matter dynamics were simulated for pastures established in 1989, 1987, 1983, 1979, 1972, 1951, and 1911. Using input data from the Nova Vida ranch, the Century model predicted that forest clearance and conversion to pasture would cause an initial decline in soil C and N stocks, followed by a slow rise to levels exceeding those under native forest. Simulated soil total C and N levels (2500 g C m-2 and 245 g N m-2 in the 0-20 cm layer) prior to conversion to pasture were close to those measured in the native forest. Simulated above- and below-ground biomass for the forest and pasture were comparable with literature values from this region. The model predicted the long-term changes in soil C and N under pasture inferred from the pasture chronosequence, but there was considerable variation in soil C stocks for pastures &lt; 20 years in age. Differences in soil texture between pastures were relatively small and could not account for much of the variability between different pastures of similar ages, in either the measured or simulated data. It is likely that much of the variability in C stocks between pastures of similar ages is related to initial C stocks immediately following deforestation and that this was the largest source of variability in the chronosequence. Internal C cycling processes in Century were evaluated using measurements of microbial biomass and soil δ13C. The relative magnitude and long-term trend in microbial biomass simulated by the model were consistent with measurements. The close fit of simulated to measured values of δ13C over time suggests that the relative loss of forest-derived C and its replacement by pasture-derived C was accurately predicted by the model. After 80 years, almost 90% of the organic matter in the top 20 cm was pasture derived. While our analysis represents a single 'case study' of pasture conversion, our results suggest that modeling studies in these pasture systems can help to evaluate the magnitude of impacts on C and N cycling, and determine the effect of management strategies on pasture sustainability. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Amazon; Century model; Forest to pasture conversion; Modeling; Soil organic matter","carbon cycle; deforestation; land cover; land use change; modeling; pasture; soil organic matter; tropical forest; Brazil; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642560503

The most pronounced ones are switching to low-sulfur fuel oil, filtering stack emissions using flue gas desulfurization systems, and shifting to natural gas as an alternative fuel for thermal power plants. The objective of this paper is to present an economic model that can be used for evaluating and comparing the three alternatives under consideration, so as to determine the most economically feasible option taking into account various cost parameters.

This covariance or coupling occurs on many time scales. This study examines the coupling of the biosphere and the atmosphere on the meso- and synoptic scales using a coupled atmosphere-biosphere regional model covering Canada. The results are compared with surface and light aircraft measurement campaigns at two boreal forest sites in Canada (Fraserdale and BERMS). Associated with cold and warm frontal features, the model results showed that the biospheric fluxes are strongly coupled to the atmosphere through radiative forcing. The presence of cloud near frontal regions usually results in reduced photosynthetic uptake, producing CO2 concentration gradients across the frontal regions on the order of 10 parts per million (ppm). Away from the frontal region, the biosphere is coupled to the mesoscale variations in similar ways, resulting in mesoscale variations in CO2 concentrations of about 5 ppm. The CO2 field is also coupled strongly to the atmospheric dynamics. In the presence of frontal circulation, the CO2 near the surface can be transported to the mid to upper troposphere. Mesoscale circulation also plays a significant part in transporting the CO2 from the planetary boundary layer (PBL) to the mid-troposphere. In the absence of significant mesoscale or synoptic scale circulation, the CO2 in the PBL has minimal exchange with the free troposphere, leading to strong gradients across the top of the PBL. We speculate that the ubiquity of the common synoptic and mesoscale processes in the atmosphere may contribute significantly to the rectifier effect and hence CO2 in version calculations. © Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, (Environment Canada), 2004.",,"atmosphere-biosphere interaction; atmospheric transport; boundary layer; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; gas exchange",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142645023

Results obtained in this study indicate that the chemical states of the dopants play pivotal roles in controlling the physicochemical properties of the metal-doped ZrO2 thin films at different temperatures. The reduction of Cr3+ and Co2+ to zerovalent metals expanded the d spacings and enlarged the crystallite sizes in the doped ZrO2 thin films at 550°C, while the incorporation of Mn2+, Fe3+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ contracted the d spacings of the ZrO2 lattices in the solid solutions. The solubility of the dopants in the ZrO2 lattices decreased at 950°C, and this phenomenon induced an m-tetragonal-to-monoclinic phase transformation in the doped ZrO2. The phase transformation was suppressed in the Cr-, Fe-, and Cu-doped ZrO2 thin films as a result of the reduction of Cr 3+ and Fe3+ to species having larger sizes than Zr 4+. Band gaps of ZrO2 were reduced in the doped ZrO 2 thin films. The newly generated band gaps of these solid solutions at 550°C were highly dependent on the d-electronic configurations of the dopants. On the other hand, the segregated metal oxides or zerovalent metals from the ZrO2 lattice at 950°C dominated the band gaps of the doped ZrO2 thin films. Dehydroxylation and deoxygenation processes drove the reduction of metal ions during the thermal treatment. The metal ions having d5 and d10 configurations in the ZrO2 lattice possessed high stability against thermally induced reductions, while the other ions tended to be reduced in the sol-gel-derived ZrO2 matrix.",,"Crystallization; Doping (additives); Energy gap; Microstructure; Sol-gels; Thin films; Band gaps; Chemical states; Metal ions; Zirconia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9744253780

It is situated 25 km north of Mount Isa and is hosted by the ∼1655 Ma Urquhart Shale in the Western fold belt of the Mount Isa inlier. George Fisher is Zn rich compared to Mount Isa and Hilton and is distinguished by a paucity of syn- to late-tectonic Cu mineralization and associated silica-dolomite alteration. The deposit contains 11 mineralized stratigraphic intervals that include intercalated pyritic siltstones and banded mudstones with abundant layer-parallel nodular and planar carbonate bands, separated by thick, barren, medium-bedded mudstones. The Zn-Pb-Ag mineralization is hosted predominantly by pyritic siltstones within each stratigraphic interval and occurs as strata-bound lenses that subparallel bedding, bifurcate, and pinch out along the extent of the main economic zone. Four styles of mineralization have been differentiated at the deposit. Layer-parallel, disseminated sphalerite comprises low-grade occurrences of Zn, whereas the bulk of ore is contained within sphalerite and galena veins and breccias that record a prolonged and texturally complex history of ore emplacement. The earliest mineralization is represented by bedding-parallel, vein-hosted sphalerite which was emplaced prior to earliest folding of the host-rock sequence (GFD 2). Layer-parallel disseminated sphalerite formed as a halo to veins as alteration and infill after secondary carbonates in host rocks and nodular carbonate layers that transgress stratigraphy at a district scale. Breccia-hosted sphalerite ore was emplaced during GFD 2 to GFD 4 fold development at the deposit and represents in situ deformed sphalerite veins and disseminated mineralization. Galena occurs as infill in veins and matrix of breccias that postdate the bulk of sphalerite and were emplaced during GFD 4, late in the tectonic history and in part synchronous with late tectonic Cu mineralization event in the district. The continuity of ore lenses, covariation of Zn and Pb grades at the deposit scale, and similarities to other sediment-hosted ore systems discount the possibility that this paragenetic complexity represents separate Zn and Pb mineralization episodes prior to and at the culmination of regional folding at George Fisher, respectively. The late textural setting of galena is interpreted as the result of preferential concentration of Pb into new structural sites during deformation. The range of sphalerite and galena mineralization styles at George Fisher is interpreted to record subsurface emplacement of Zn and Pb, possibly during diagenesis or associated with early weak brittle deformation in at least semiconsolidated sediments, followed by extensive textural modification of the orebody during the folding history of the deposit. © 2004 by Economic Geology.",,"Mineralization; Planar carbonate bands; Carbonate minerals; Rocks; Sediments; Silica; Stratigraphy; lead; metallogenesis; mineralization; silver; zinc; Australasia; Australia; Mount Isa; Queensland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242876861

To study the recovery of native plant communities, rabbits were eradicated by poisoning on two islands. This produced a significant increase in species richness on both islands with a decline in the cover of some native species (primarily A. magellanica) and an increase in the abundance of alien species (especially Taraxacum officinale). Other native species showed signs of increased abundance but overall responses were slow. These trends are obviously due to the removal of grazing, but recent changes in climatic conditions (warming and drought) may also be responsible for the decline or slow recovery of native species, and for the success of introduced species. Owing to the effects of present climate changes on plant communities, eradication of alien herbivores may not be always appropriate for the conservation of native biota in the subantarctic islands, and regulation of populations should be explored. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We demonstrate that KlSnf1p and KlCat8p from K. lactis interact in a two-hybrid system and that the interaction is stronger with a kinase-dead mutant form of KlSnf1p. Of two putative phosphorylation sites in the KlCat8p sequence, serine 661 was identified as a key residue governing KlCat8p regulation. Serine 661 is located in the middle homology region, a regulatory domain conserved among zinc cluster transcription factors, and is part of an Snf1p consensus phosphorylation site. Single mutations at this site are sufficient to completely change the carbon source regulation of the KlCat8p transactivation activity observed. A serine-to-glutamate mutant form mimicking constitutive phosphorylation results in a nearly constitutively active form of KlCat8p, while a serine-to-alanine mutation has the reverse effect. Furthermore, it is shown that KlCat8p phosphorylation depends on KlSNF1. The Snf1-Cat8 connection is evolutionarily conserved: mutation of corresponding serine 562 of ScCat8p gave similar results in S. cerevisiae. The enhanced capacity of ScCat8S562E to suppress the phenotype caused by snf1 strengthens the hypothesis of direct phosphorylation of Cat8p by Snf1p. Unlike that of S. cerevisiae ScCAT8, KlCAT8 transcription is not carbon source regulated, illustrating the prominent role of posttranscriptional regulation of Cat8p in K. lactis.

Heated air diluted with nitrogen was used to initiate the regeneration process. Temperatures at 11 locations inside the filter were measured with embedded thermocouples which were equally spaced in the axial direction. Based on the temperature data, the instantaneous heat release of the filter was derived and analyzed. The peak regeneration temperature was found to occur at the region near the filter exit, and fibers in this region could melt when the temperature was sufficiently high. The normal regeneration temperature was around 800°C to 1000°C but local temperature could be as high as 1300°C. Thermal regeneration of the filter was found to depend on several factors, including, oxygen concentration in the heated air, initial particulate loading, packing density, thickness of the filtering element, and flow rate of the heated air. It was found that for regeneration to occur, the temperature of the heated air should exceed 500°C, the filtering element should have a minimum thickness of 50mm and a minimum initial particulate loading of 2 gram. Regeneration, and hence, heat release, was found to start earlier at higher oxygen concentration in the heated air, higher heated air flow rate, lower packing density and higher initial particulate loading. Regeneration temperature was higher at higher oxygen concentration in the heated air, lower heated air flow-rate, higher packing density and higher initial particulate loading.

By addition of a small amount of iron (0.3% Fe to 10% Cu/SiO2), the catalytic activity and stability of Cu/SiO2 at high temperatures were effectively improved. The Cu/SiO2 catalyst had low copper surface area when it was calcined and reduced at 600°C. Due to the addition of iron, Cu-Fe catalysts provided high copper surface area, even if these catalysts were pretreated at high temperatures. At 600°C and atmospheric pressure, the Cu-Fe catalysts exhibited high and constant catalytic activity up to 120h. In contrast, the 10% Cu/SiO2 catalysts without Fe additives deactivated rapidly. Loss of copper surface area and oxidation of copper are the main factors causing the decay of catalytic activity of Cu/SiO2 at high temperatures. The new active species located at the interface between Cu and Fe particles is proposed to be an important factor in enhancing catalytic activity. On the other hand, Fe in Cu-Fe catalysts surprisingly inhibits the sintering and oxidation of Cu and elevates the catalytic stability of Cu-Fe catalysts. The formation of small particles of iron species around Cu particles effectively prevents sintering of Cu at high temperatures. Oxygen releasing from the reaction on Cu can rapidly diffuse to Fe surfaces to form Fe oxides through a spillover process. This keeps Cu in its reduced state. Iron also offers similar promotions in catalytic activity, thermal stability and prevention of copper oxidation for Cu/Al 2O3 and commercial Cu/Zn/Al catalysts. © 2003 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Catalytic activity; Catalytic stability; Cu-Fe catalysts; Water gas shift reaction","Atmospheric pressure; Calcination; Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Copper; High temperature effects; Hydrogenation; Interfaces (materials); Oxidation; Reaction kinetics; Silica; Surface phenomena; Surfaces; Temperature programmed desorption; Thermodynamic stability; X ray diffraction analysis; Catalytic stability; Temperature programmed reduction (TPR); Catalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347565995

To identify differentially expressed genes and to gain insight into pathogenic mechanisms, we performed a stringent analysis of the microarray dataset obtained with RNA from whole brains of P301L mutant mice and identified a single up-regulated gene, glyoxalase I. This enzyme plays a critical role in the detoxification of dicarbonyl compounds and thereby reduces the formation of advanced glycation end products. In situ hybridization analysis revealed expression of glyoxalase I in all brain areas analyzed, both in transgenic and control mice. However, levels of glyoxalase I protein were significantly elevated in P301L brains, as shown by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemistry. Moreover, a glyoxalase I-specific anti-serum revealed many intensely stained flame-shaped neurons in Alzheimer's disease brain compared with brains from nondemented controls. In addition, we examined a single nucleotide polymorphism predicting a nonconservative amino acid substitution at position 111 (E111A) in ethnically independent populations. We identified significant and consistent deviations from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, which points to the presence of selection forces. The E111A single nucleotide polymorphism was not associated with the risk for Alzheimer's disease in the overall population. Together, our data demonstrate the potential of transcriptomics applied to animal models of human diseases. They suggest a previously unidentified role for glyoxalase I in neurodegenerative disease.",,"advanced glycation end product; lactoylglutathione lyase; adult; aged; Alzheimer disease; amino acid substitution; animal experiment; article; brain region; cell structure; controlled study; degenerative disease; detoxification; female; frontotemporal dementia; gene control; gene expression; histopathology; human; human cell; human tissue; immunohistochemistry; in situ hybridization; major clinical study; male; mouse; nerve cell; neurofibrillary tangle; nonhuman; pathogenesis; priority journal; protein determination; protein function; RNA isolation; single nucleotide polymorphism; transgenic mouse; upregulation; Western blotting; Alzheimer Disease; Amino Acid Substitution; Animals; Brain; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Immunohistochemistry; Lactoylglutathione Lyase; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; RNA, Messenger; Up-Regulation; Animalia; Mus musculus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442652837

Kehan 50) plants were grown in pots under three atmospheric CO2 concentrations (ambient, 550 and 750 p.p.m.) in field open-top chambers (OTCs), with half of the plants subjected to aphid (Sitobion avenae Fabricius) infestation. Increase in CO2 levels increased host plant growth and grain yield, and decreased 1000-grain dry weight compared with ambient CO2. On the contrary, aphids had a negative effect on 1000-grain dry weight. Host plants grown at elevated CO 2 generally had greater ear starch, sucrose, glucose, total non-structure carbohydrates (TNCs), ratio of TNC:nitrogen, free amino acids and soluble protein and less ear fructose and nitrogen. However, the aphids did not affect the ear nitrogen and ratio of TNC:nitrogen. The responses of apterous and alate aphids to enrichment CO2 atmosphere were different. Local population of aphids, including apterous and alate forms infested on host plants in OTCs, increased with elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Emigrating alate aphids captured on sticky yellow paper decreased with rising CO 2. CO2 affected the reproductive activity of alate aphids. The alate forms deposited more offspring on plants grown at 550 and 750 p.p.m. CO2 compared with ambient CO2. Both population abundance of local aphids and reproductive activity of alate aphids correlated positively with ear starch, sucrose, glucose, TNCs, raito of TNC : nitrogen and free amino acids, while negatively with ear fructose and nitrogen.

The reduction of N2O is thermodynamically favorable but kinetically inert, and requires activating transition-metal centers. In biological systems, N2O reduction is the last step in the denitrification process of the bacterial nitrogen cycle and is accomplished by the enzyme nitrous oxide reductase, whose active site consists of a μ4-sulfide-bridged tetranuclear CuZ cluster which has many unusual spectroscopic features. Recent studies have developed a detailed electronic-structure description of the resting CuZ cluster, determined its catalytically relevant state, and provided insight into the role of this tetranuclear copper cluster in N2O activation and reduction.","Bioinorganic chemistry; Copper; Electronic structure; Metalloenzymes; Structure-activity relationships","Catalysis; Electronic structure; Greenhouse effect; Nitrogen compounds; Redox reactions; Spectroscopic analysis; Sulfur compounds; Thermodynamics; Transition metals; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen cycle; Nitrous oxide; Nitrification; copper; nitric oxide reductase; nitrogen; oxygen; sulfide; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide reductase; oxidoreductase; catalysis; cluster analysis; denitrification; electron; gas analysis; kinetics; oxidation; reduction; short survey; spectroscopy; structure analysis; thermodynamics; binding site; chemical structure; chemistry; electron spin resonance; metabolism; oxidation reduction reaction; review; structure activity relation; Binding Sites; Copper; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Models, Molecular; Nitrous Oxide; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidoreductases; Structure-Activity Relationship",Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544231537

Results indicated kinetic preference for mesomorphic order in bulk DH-CNPPV, with the isotropization temperature (T i) located in the vicinity of 210°C. Upon heat treatment at elevated temperatures (Ta) below Ti, supramolecular self-assembly of DH-CNPPV chains results in lamellar structure ca. 2.0 nm in layer spacing. This lamellar phase exists in the form of nanodomains (ca. 10-20 nm in diameter) that agglomerate into wormlike features with DH-CNPPV backbones and the mesomorphic lamellae lying transverse to the worm's long axis. Details in the selected-area electron diffraction pattern of shear-oriented specimens prescribe a short intraboard spacing of 0.38 nm and longitudinal displacement by one-third of the repeating unit between neighboring backbones, such that adequate interaction between the cyano group and the phenylene ring is allowed for. Accompanying the thermally induced morphological changes, UV-vis light absorption behavior varies consistently with improvement or disruption of the lamellar order whereas the major emission in the photoexcited spectrum shifts from 590 to 640 nm upon emergence of mesomorphic order, which is directly excitable and hence attributable to either extended backbone conjugation or enhanced interchain delocalization in the mesomorphic state. This is in dramatic contrast to the closely related case of poly(2,5-di-n-octyl-oxy-1,4- phenylenevinylene) (DO-PPV) without cyano substitutions in the backbone (for which excimer emission is the preferred mode upon morphological aggregation), signifying the role of specific cyano-phenylene interaction in the ground state of aggregated chains in the mesomorphic phase.",,"Agglomeration; Differential scanning calorimetry; Diffractometers; Electroluminescence; Electron diffraction; Light absorption; Light emission; Liquid crystal polymers; Photoelectron spectroscopy; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Thin films; Transmission electron microscopy; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Van der Waals forces; X ray diffraction; Isotropization temperature; Lamellar structures; Mesomorphic phases; Molecular aggregation; Organic polymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142736596

A full-length cDNA with an open reading frame of 1179 bp that encodes 392 amino acid residues was obtained from an indica rice variety, 93-11. The OsSbp is a single locus gene in the rice genome. It Is localized in the region of 8.42-8.59 Mb on the short arm of chromosome 4, flanked by markers R288 and S11182. RT-PCR analysis revealed that OsSbp gene is expressed in all the tissues we tested, and OsSbp transcript level can be dramatically boosted by light Illumination. Its expression is down-regulated by externally applied NaCl, ABA, MeJA and glucose over 24 h, whereas up-regulated by GA after 24 h treatments.

Isolates were grouped according to their restriction patterns, and 16S rDNA of representatives from each group were sequenced. A plant dependent enrichment of Agrobacterium-related denitrifiers has been observed resulting in a modification of the structure of the denitrifying community between planted and bulk soil.

Simulation results have been compared with observed values as well as with results from other models. The operational version of DMI-HIRLAM using well-known basic advection schemes has been tested, showing the need for improvements for air pollution purposes. The fourth-order Bott algorithm for advection has thus been implemented in the semi-Lagrangian version of DMI-HIRLAM. Due to its practically perfect mass conservation properties and its low computational cost, this method turns out to be efficient for simulations of transport of pollutants in the atmosphere.

However, we know little about the potential turnover of these components and the concomitant growth of bacteria under conditions of intermittent or transient inputs of natural dissolved organic matter (DOM) compared to quasi-steady state, low DOM conditions. The present study evaluated the short-term (∼3 d) rates and net extents of utilization (as measured losses) of selected constituents of plankton-derived DOM (DOMPD) by indigenous bacterioplankton populations in eastern North Pacific surface waters, and assessed bacterial growth efficiencies (BGE) during temporarily non-limiting DOM conditions. Approximately 28 % of the starting dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and 34 % of the dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in incubations supplemented with DOM PD could be characterized as dissolved free and combined amino acids (DFAA and DCAA, respectively) and monosaccharides (MCHO). Up to 31 % of the added DOC and 26 % of the added DON was utilized in +DOMPD incubations; however, BGE under supplemented conditions (∼4 to 5%) was similar to estimates for ambient oligotrophic waters. Of the net DOC consumed, 75 % was accounted for by DFAA (which alone was 61 % of the total), DCAA, and MCHO, while the remaining non-characterizable 25 % may represent an inherent or rapidly formed component of lower reactivity. In contrast to DOC, net DON utilization was supported entirely by DFAA and DCAA, with DFAA alone accounting for the vast majority (up to 99%). Together, DCAA and MCHO accounted for only ∼13 % of the DOC consumed and ≤∼5 % of the DON (i.e. as DCAA) utilized. These findings are consistent with bacterial growth in the open ocean being controlled predominantly by inputs of a small fraction of bulk DOM, and further suggest that bacteria may function primarily as remineralizers even during transient periods where labile DOC and DON is relatively available.","Bacterial growth efficiency; Dissolved combined amino acids; Dissolved free amino acids; DOC; DON; Monosaccharides; Plankton-derived DOM","Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143049198

In this kind of flames spectral lines are observed in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet regions; emissions of visible light are however not so strong as in other wavelengths, especially in the near-infrared and infrared portions of the spectrum. Using a video camera, coupled with an optical filter, it is possible to capture images of the flame in a burner and then acquire sequences of images of the near-infrared emission during the combustion process. In this work, carried out in the frame of a collaboration between ENEL Produzione Ricerca and ISTI CNR, we propose a method suitable to process and analyse maps of near-infrared emissions in order to characterize the flame morphology and compute geometric and densitometric features useful to describe the combustion dynamics. The map of the emissions presents in some cases different unconnected sources with interesting distribution.

Both genes demonstrated the presence of Methanomicrobiaceae, Methanobacteriaceae, Methanosarcinaceae, Methanosaetaceae, and Rice cluster I, an uncultured methanogenic lineage. The pathway of CH4 formation was determined from the 13C-isotopic signatures of the produced CH4, CO2 and acetate. Conditions and duration of incubation clearly affected the methanogenic community structure and the pathway of CH4 formation. Methane was initially produced from reduction of CO2 exclusively, resulting in accumulation of millimolar concentrations of acetate. Simultaneously, the relative abundance of the acetoclastic methanogens (Methanosarcinaceae, Methanosaetaceae), as determined by T-RFLP analysis of 16S rRNA genes, was low during the initial phase of CH4 production. Later on, however, acetate was converted to CH4 so that about 40% of the produced CH4 originated from acetate. Most striking was the observed relative increase of a population of Methanosarcina spp. (but not of Methanosaeta spp.) briefly before acetate concentrations started to decrease. Both acetoclastic methanogenesis and Methanosarcina populations were suppressed by high phosphate concentrations, as observed under application of different buffer systems. Our results demonstrate the parallel change of microbial community structure and function in a complex environment, i.e., the increase of acetoclastic Methanosarcina spp. when high acetate concentrations become available.",,"acetic acid derivative; carbon; methane; RNA 16S; microbial ecology; article; biological model; comparative study; DNA sequence; Euryarchaeota; gas chromatography; genetics; high performance liquid chromatography; metabolism; microbiology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; phylogeny; plant root; population dynamics; restriction fragment length polymorphism; rice; statistical model; time; Acetates; Base Sequence; Carbon Isotopes; Chromatography, Gas; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Euryarchaeota; Likelihood Functions; Methane; Models, Genetic; Molecular Sequence Data; Oryza sativa; Phylogeny; Plant Roots; Polymorphism, Restriction Fragment Length; Population Dynamics; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Time Factors; Archaea; Euryarchaeota; Methanobacteriaceae; Methanomicrobiaceae; Methanosaeta; Methanosaetaceae; Methanosarcina; Methanosarcinaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642423892

From the ecological viewpoint, this diversity is of different kinds and has the potential to cater to human well-being in multifarious ways. However, the mix of services that is available to any economy from forests depends, in addition to their biological characteristics, on the nature of the economic regime within which they are exploited. Some commodities such as timber are extracted in a regime driven, in the main, by market forces. Others such as non-timber forest products may be extracted under a variety of arrangements, the range varying from open access to common property regimes. Services such as those of water cycle augmentation and micro-climate regulation are typically available to communities as free goods. It is hypothesized that this difference in institutional regimes has implications for the mix of products and services that are extracted in different ways. Through its effect on the extraction efforts for the marketed product. Because of policies, such as plantation, which are intended to increase the supply of the marketed product, typically, timber. Through a change in biodiversity of the forest stock which in turn results in a decreased availability of the non-marketed products. The present paper studies conditions under which timber has been extracted from forests of the north Indian state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) during the 1975-2000 period to examine this proposition. It is postulated that extraction of timber at any point of time depends on the stock, the effort involved in extraction (as represented by the per unit cost of extraction), the biodiversity index (defined as a product biodiversity index) and a variable depicting ecological characteristics of the forests. Using a modified Gordon-Schaefer production function, and the assumption that forests are managed for ""sustainable timber extraction"", the reduced form equations are derived and estimated using data from Uttar Pradesh forests for the 1975-2000 period. The results suggest that, in the absence of variables representing the plantation area and biodiversity-corrected stocks, the explanatory power of the model is low, even though extraction is seen to be significantly impacted by effort. If, however, the ratio of plantation area and biodiversity-adjusted extraction are introduced as explanatory variables, interesting results with respect to the trend of extraction over time are obtained. As stocks of woody biomass increase, extraction increases. A decrease in biodiversity of the stock may be accompanied, under a certain set of circumstances, with a rising trend in extraction, and at a rising rate as explained above. However, an increased biodiversity may imply a decreasing trend in the extraction in the future provided that present extraction Y does not rise at a rate faster than the rate of increase in the biodiversity. These two results seen together are, we believe, significant. They point to the fact that policies aimed at increasing plantation increase short-run timber extraction. Further, if biodiversity increases, the impact on future extraction of timber depends on relative rates of change in biodiversity and extraction per unit effort. It is clear that trade-offs between timber extraction and existence of biodiverse forests providing a variety of goods and services. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

However, the latest climate change talks held in December 2003 in Milan showed that officials from other countries (EU, Japan, and Canada) are moving ahead with legislation to curb CO2 emissions, despite intense US opposition to mandatory greenhouse gas emissions cuts. The protocol calls on industrialized countries to reduce emissions by an average of 5% from 1990 levels by 2012. Implementation requires ratification by 55 countries, including those responsible for 55% of industrialized countries' 1990 emissions. Only Russia's ratification can move the treaty beyond the 55% trigger because the Bush Administration withdrew US support of the protocol. Even if the Russians fail to approve the protocol, its mere existence ""has demonstrably forced countries to come up with a serious plan to achieve compliance"", according to Jeff Fiedler of the Natural Resources Defense council. The report attributes most of the blame to runaway emissions from road and air transport, which are projected to rise to 34% above 1990 levels by 2010. Instead of mandatory emissions caps, the Bush Administration is banking on technological breakthroughs and voluntary efforts by industry to slow the growth rate of emissions, but not total emissions.

Based on these features, three principal climatic stages can be defined in geological history: (a) non-glacial (Early Archean), (b) with episodic glaciations (Late Archean-Middle Riphean), and (c) with frequent periodical glaciations (Riphean-Recent). (2) Irreversible climate changes were complicated and disguised by numerous superimposed temperature fluctuations of different periodicity and amplitude. In the Phanerozoic, a hierarchy of subordinate climatic fluctuations of 10-12 ranks, from extremely long (few hundreds million years) to short-term (tens years long only) is defined. Signs of climatic fluctuations of two-three highest ranks are recognizable in Proterozoic glacial sections. (3) The hierarchy of climatic fluctuations was stable during the Phanerozoic at least. (4) Amplitudes of climatic fluctuations depended on the cophasing degree of elementary climatic oscillations and character of their feedbacks in the biosphere. (5) The warm non-glacial climate prevailed during the Precambrian and Phanerozoic and was characteristic of 90% of the Phanerozoic and 95% of the post-Archean geological history. (6) Many climatic fluctuations, all those of first rank included, were of a global scale, synchronous, and cophasal. (7) Regional climate changes were caused by paleogeographic factors. (8) Global climate changes resulted in transformation of the latitudinal climatic zonality. The notion ""global climate"" is introduced to characterize the type of a planetary climatic zonality. Macrogeographic factors transformed latitudinal climatic belts into sublatitudinal ones. (9) Two main types of global climate (non-glacial and glacial) are defined. Transitions from non-glacial to glacial climate and vice versa were accompanied by rapid qualitative zonality reorganizations. (10) Each type of global climate is subdivided into gradations. (11) A peculiar feature of the global climate was an asymmetric position of climatic belts relative the equator. The asymmetry, which was insignificant during the non-glacial periods, and substantially increased at the time of glaciations, particularly of the great ones. © 2004 by MAIK ""Nauka/Interperiodica"" (Russia).","And cophasal patterns; Asymmetry; Climatic zonality; Global; Irreversible climate changes; Its reorganizations; Quasi-periodic fluctuations; Synchronous; Their hierarchy","climate change; cooling; glaciation; global change; paleoclimate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442625693

The stomatal ozone fluxes are calculated using the analogy with water vapour fluxes inside the stomata. By integrating stomatal fluxes over time, ozone doses received by the plants are calculated. At most sites, the stomatal ozone flux accounts <50% of the total flux, except for those sites located at the northern edge of the geographical domain studied. Sites characterized by a rather dry Mediterranean climate generally show reduced stomatal fluxes, even in the case of high ozone concentrations. The role of water supply, influencing stomatal activity, appears essential. This approach, using time integration of ozone stomatal fluxes, yielding ozone doses to vegetation, is then compared with the use of the exposure index AOT40, widely used in ozone risk assessment work.

The first Little Ice Age advance in this area began more than 500 years ago and peaked in the early 17th century. An earlier Neoglacial advance began about 2800-3000calyr ago and may have lasted for hundreds of years. There is also evidence for an intervening advance of even smaller magnitude around 1200-1300calyr ago. The advances are broadly synchronous with those in other parts of western North America, indicating that they were caused by regional, possibly global, changes in climate. Plant communities within the study area did not change dramatically during the late Holocene. The ranges of some plants, however, likely retracted or extended near treeline in response to changes in mean temperatures of perhaps 1-2°C, as well as changes in summer snow cover. The greatest changes in vegetation occurred within and just beyond the forefields of Berendon, Frank Mackie, and other nearby glaciers. The largest climate shifts of the last 3000 years took place during the late Little Ice Age and the last century. Climate warmed about 1-2°C during the 20th century, accompanied by a rise in treeline, an increase in coniferous tree cover in the subalpine zone, and an increase in the temperature and biological productivity of ponds. These trends are likely to continue if climate, as expected, continues to warm. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Emphasis also will focus on research to improve access to onshore public lands, e.g, the Rocky Mountains region, thought to contain large undiscovered gas volumes. About $6 million will support a program to study gas hydrates, production of which has the potential to have major energy security implications.

The method resamples data from the historical record ""nens"" times for the period of interest (nens = number of ensemble members) and reorders the ensemble members to reconstruct the observed spatial (intersite) and temporal correlation statistics. The weather generator model is applied to 2307 stations in the contiguous United States and is shown to reproduce the observed spatial correlation between neighboring stations, the observed correlation between variables (e.g., between precipitation and temperature), and the observed temporal correlation between subsequent days in the generated weather sequence. The weather generator model is extended to produce sequences of weather that are conditioned on climate indices (in this case the Niño 3.4 index). Example illustrations of conditioned weather sequences are provided for a station in Arizona (Petrified Forest, 34.8°N, 109.9°W), where El Niño and La Niña conditions have a strong effect on winter precipitation. The conditioned weather sequences generated using the methods described in this paper are appropriate for use as input to hydrologic models to produce multiseason forecasts of streamflow.","Hydroclimatology; Prediction; Stochastic hydrology","Climate change; Correlation methods; Hydrology; Precipitation (meteorology); Stream flow; Climate indices; Winter precipitation; Weather modification; hydrometeorology; precipitation assessment; prediction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442689532

Lyngby, Denmark","The worldwide used herbicide dichlobenil (2,6-dichlorobenzonitrile) has resulted in widespread presence of its metabolite 2,6-dichlorobenzamide (BAM) in pore- and groundwater. To evaluate the transport of these compounds we studied the sorption of dichlobenil and BAM in 22 sediment samples of clayey till, sand, and limestone including sediments exhibiting varying oxidation states. Dichlobenil sorbed to all investigated sediments, with a high sorption in topsoils (Kd = 7.4-17.4 L kg-1) and clayey till sediments (Kd = 2.7-126 L kg-1), The sorption of the polar metabolite BAM was much lower than the sorption of dichlobenil but followed the same tendency with the highest sorption in the topsoils (Kd = 0.24-0.66 L kg-1) and in the clayey till sediments (Kd = 0.10-0.93 L kg-1). The sorption of both compounds was significantly higher (2-47 times) in the unoxidized (reduced) clayey till than in the weathered (oxidized) clayey till. Such a difference in sorption capacity could neither be explained by a higher organic carbon content, sorption to clay minerals, differences in clay mineralogy, nor by blocking of reactive surface sites on clay minerals by iron oxides. However, by removing an average of 81% of the organic carbon from the reduced clayey till with H2O 2, the sorption decreased on average 50%. Therefore, most of the sorption capacity in the reduced clayey till was related to organic carbon, which indicates that sorption processes are affected by changes in organic compound composition due to weathering.",,"Organic carbon content; Polar metabolites; Aquifers; Clay; Clay minerals; Composition; Concentration (process); Metabolites; Oxidation; Sedimentation; Sorption; Sediments; 2,6 dichlorobenzamide; carbon; dichlobenil; ground water; herbicide; iron oxide; mineral; organic carbon; unclassified drug; aquifer; herbicide; metabolite; pollutant transport; sediment pollution; soil pollution; sorption; aquifer; article; chemical composition; nonhuman; oxidation; process model; sand; sediment transport; sedimentology; soil analysis; soil pollution; statistical significance; weathering; Adsorption; Aluminum Silicates; Benzamides; Carbon; Denmark; Ferric Compounds; Fresh Water; Geologic Sediments; Herbicides; Minerals; Nitriles; Oxidation-Reduction; Pesticide Residues; Quartz; Silicon Dioxide; Soil; Water Pollution, Chemical; Water Supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444350999

This is an agricultural region of mixed cropping and grazing extending about 100 km west of the town of Wagga Wagga, NSW, Australia. The analysis proceeds in three stages: first, a simple one-dimensional model of the well-mixed layer (the CBL slab model), forced with measurements of the surface heat and evaporation fluxes, is evaluated by comparing measured and modelled CBL temperature, humidity and depths. A comparison of several entrainment schemes shows that a simple model, where the entrainment kinetic energy is parameterised as a fraction (α3) of the surface sensible heat flux, works well if α3 is set to 0.5. Second, the slab model is coupled to a Penman-Monteith model of surface evaporation to predict regional scale evaporation and thence heat fluxes. Finally, the integral CBL budget approach, which is an inverse method using the one-dimensional slab model, is used to infer regional heat and evaporation fluxes from measured time series of CBL temperature and humidity. We find that the simple CBL slab model works reasonably well for predicting CBL depth and very well for CBL temperature, especially if approximate estimates of subsidence velocity and warming due to advection are included. Regional sensible heat fluxes estimated from the integral CBL method match those measured, although the method is very sensitive to measurement errors. Measurement-model differences were larger for short integration times, because the well-mixed assumptions are violated at particular times of the day. The corollary is that 'whole-day' (0530-1530 h) estimates are in reasonable agreement with measured values. Integral methods could not be used to infer the regional evaporation flux directly because CBL humidity profiles were complex and often not well mixed until mid-afternoon. We recommend that regional evaporation fluxes be predicted either from a coupled Penman-Monteith - CBL slab model, or inferred as a residual term from estimates of the regionally averaged available energy and sensible heat flux. Furthermore, we show that inferring fluxes via integral methods will always be difficult when the scalar concentrations have either a large surface source and free atmosphere sink (in the case of water vapour and methane), or a large surface sink and upper level source (in the case of CO2).","Boundary-layer budget methods; OASIS; Regional evaporation; Surface heterogeneity","Agriculture; Boundary layers; Evaporation; Heat flux; Kinetic energy; Water; Surface heat; Meteorological problems; agricultural land; convective boundary layer; humidity; latent heat flux; sensible heat flux; temperature; water vapor; Australasia; Australia; New South Wales; Wagga Wagga",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0742288504

However, policies to promote the utilization of biomass crops require yield estimates that can be scaled up to regional, national and continental areas. The only way in which this information can be reliably provided is through the use of productivity models. Here, we describe MISCANMOD, a productivity model, which was used in conjunction with a GIS to plot potential, non-water-limited yields across Europe. Modelled rainfed yields were also calculated using a water balance approach based on FAO estimates of plant available water in the soil. The observed yields were consistent with modelled yields at 20 trial sites across Europe. We estimate that if Miscanthus was grown on 10% of suitable land area in the European Union (EU15), 231 TWh yr-1 of electricity could be generated, which is 9% of the gross electricity production in 2000. Using the same scenario, the total carbon mitigation could be 76 Mt Cyr-1, which is about 9% of the EU total C emissions for the 1990 Kyoto Protocol baseline levels. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biomass; Carbon substitution; GIS; Miscanthus; Model","biomass; carbon emission; crop production; crop yield; emission control; energy crop; fossil fuel; Eurasia; Europe; Miscanthus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6444220542

This initiative seeks to evaluate the costs and benefits of alternative public policy actions in a wide range of key policy areas. For comparability, each of the studies in this programme identifies a limited number of policy actions and examines their respective costs and benefits. This chapter examines the issue area of abatement of greenhouse gas emissions to limit future damage from global warming. Three policy strategies are evaluated: (a) an optimal, globally coordinated carbon tax; (b) the Kyoto Protocol; and (c) a value-at-risk strategy setting carbon taxes to limit exposure to high damage. First, however, a considerable portion of this chapter must be devoted to the conceptual framework and key assumptions used in modelling costs and benefits from abatement of global warming. The next section of this study briefly reviews the state of play in the scientific and international policy deliberations on global warming. It summarises the key findings of the 2001 review of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and reviews the status of the Kyoto Protocol. The next section discusses crucial methodological components that can drive sharply contrasting results in cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) of global warming abatement, including especially the question of appropriate time discounting for issues with century-scale time horizons.

Toward that end, we have developed and verified the first mobile laboratory that measures on-road or real-world emissions from engines at the quality level specified in the U.S. Congress Code of Federal Regulations. This unique mobile laboratory provides information on integrated and modal regulated gaseous emission rates and integrated emission rates for speciated volatile and semivolatile organic compounds and particulate matter during real-world operation. Total emissions are captured and collected from the HDD vehicle that is pulling the mobile laboratory. While primarily intended to accumulate data from HDD vehicles, it may also be used to measure emission rates from stationary diesel sources such as back-up generators. This paper describes the development of the mobile laboratory, its measurement capabilities, and the verification process and provides the first data on total capture gaseous on-road emission measurements following the California Air Resources Board (ARB) 4-mode driving cycle, the hot urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS), the modified 5-mode cycle, and a 53.2-mi highway chase experiment. NOx mass emission rates (g mi -1) for the ARB 4-mode driving cycle, the hot UDDS driving cycle, and the chase experiment were found to exceed current emission factor estimates for the engine type tested by ∼50%. It was determined that congested traffic flow as well as ""off-Federal Test Procedure cycle"" emissions can lead to significant increases in per mile NOx emission rates for HDD vehicles.",,"Air pollution; Diesel engines; Laboratories; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Backup generators; Mobile laboratory; Environmental engineering; diesel fuel; air quality; diesel engine; emission inventory; measurement method; particulate matter; pollutant source; air pollution; air quality; article; bioaccumulation; control system; dynamometry; exhaust gas; flow rate; laboratory test; measurement; particulate matter; urban area; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Equipment Design; Sensitivity and Specificity; Vehicle Emissions; Volatilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842779069

Increasing atmospheric concentrations are believed to be responsible for a gradual warming of the Earth. Strategies to reduce anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere by sequestration underground or in the deep ocean are being investigated. An international collaboration to conduct a field experiment on CO2 ocean sequestration was initiated in December 1997. The primary objective of this project is to obtain data that can be applied to assess environmental impacts of direct injection of CO2 into the deep ocean. The collaboration is being implemented by a research team comprising engineers and scientists from five nations: Japan, the US, Norway, Canada, and Australia. This paper focuses on studies being conducted as part of the field experiment to investigate the influence of decreased seawater pH from CO2 dissolution on bacterial production in the ocean. A preliminary analysis of the variation in bacterial production under different values of pH and temperature, conducted in July 1999, indicated that there was no measurable effect on the microbial population in the first 24 h of the experiment. However, there was a rapid decline in bacterial production with decreases in pH over a 96 h incubation period. In addition, the impact of reduced pH was more pronounced when the bacteria were grown at warmer temperatures, i.e. with a more rapid potential production rate. Subsequent laboratory experiments were conducted in June 2000 using pressure chambers to determine the effect of depressurization on bacterial production. For this effort, seawater samples were collected from a 600 m deep pipeline off the Kona coast of the island of Hawaii. Water was placed in a pressure chamber and allowed to stabilize for 48 h at the ambient pressure and temperature of 600 m depth at the sampling location. After 48 h, the water was depressurized and acidified with CO2 to pH values of 6.95 and 5.6. The acidified water and an un-amended sample were incubated at 5, 10 and 15 °C for 96 h and sampled every 24 h. Similar impacts to those observed previously on the bacterial production were noted. The overall result was that longer incubation times and warmer temperatures reduced bacterial production in samples exposed to the lower pH. This observation is beneficial to develop an understanding of the long term effects of CO2 releases on basic elemental cycles that support aquatic food chains. Future work needs to investigate long term variation in the bacterial community, the impact on nutrient recycling, and the population growth efficiency.

The Bush administration adamantly refused to advance a meaningful strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and to commit the United States to the Kyoto Protocol. At the same time, a number of highly public disputes compromised the legitimacy of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). This appraisal reviews the Bush administration's performance midway through its first term across three pivotal environmental concerns: air pollution, climate change, and toxics remediation. Though environmental proponents denounced the U.S. EPA's provocative policy positions, there are no indications that this criticism has had much political impact. The assessment concludes with an examination of the politics behind the Bush administration's growing anti-environmentalism and some speculation regarding its future electoral implications. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","American environmental politics; Bush administration; Clear skies; Climate change; Environmental policy; Global warming; Kyoto protocol; Superfund","climate change; environmental policy; Kyoto Protocol; leadership; national planning; performance assessment; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242321381

The climate change produced by the greenhouse gases, the inefficiency of the energy system or the lack of power supply infrastructure in most of the poor countries, the liberalization of the energy market and the development of new technologies in the field of distributed generation (DG) are the key factors of this revolution. It seems clear that the solution at the moment is the DG. The advantage of DG is the energy generation close to the demand point. It means that DG can lower costs, reduce emissions, or expand the energy options of the consumers. DG may add redundancy that increases grid security even while powering emergency lighting or other critical systems and reduces power losses in the electricity distribution. After the development of the different DG and high efficiency technologies, such as co-generation and tri-generation, the next step in the DG world is the interconnection of different small distributed generation facilities which act together in a DG network as a large power plant controlled by a centralized energy management system (EMS). The main aim of the EMS is to reach the targets of low emissions and high efficiency. The EMS gives priority to renewable energy sources instead of the use of fossil fuels. This new concept of energy infrastructure is referred to as virtual utility (VU). The VU can be defined as a new model of energy infrastructure which consists of integrating different kind of distributed generation utilities in an energy (electricity and heat) generation network controlled by a central energy management system (EMS). The electricity production in the network is subordinated to the heat necessity of every user. The thermal energy is consumed on site; the electricity is generated and distributed in the entire network. The network is composed of one centralized control with the EMS and different clusters of distributed generation utilities and heat storage tanks. Each of these clusters is controlled by a local management station (LMS). Every LMS has information about the requirements (heat, cold and electricity) of the users connected to its cluster and the state of the utilities and water level of the storage tanks in its cluster. The EMS receives the information from the LMSs and sets the electricity input or output of every cluster in the network. With the information ordered by the EMS, the LMS set the run or stand-by of the utilities of its cluster. The benefits of the VU are the optimization of the utilization yield of the whole network, the high reliability of the electricity production, the complete control of the network for achieving the main aim of the EMS, the high velocity for assuming quick changes in the demand of the system and high integration of renewable energy sources, plus the advantages of the DG. This paper indicates the state of the art of the VU concept, analyses the projects that are being developed in this field and considers the future of the VU concept. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Cogeneration; Conventional energy generation facilities; Distributed generation; Energy infrastructure; Energy management system; Low emissions; Renewable energy sources; Virtual utility","Electricity; Energy management; Fossil fuels; Greenhouses; Industrial emissions; Optimization; Power plants; Tanks (containers); Greenhouse gases; Virtual utility; Power generation; cogeneration; electricity generation; energy planning; renewable resource",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0442328532

Approximately 10% of the total nitrogen load to the embayment is intercepted by fresh water ponds and delivered to the coast by connecting streams. For the nitrogen load not intercepted by ponds, we compare two steady-state methods of analyzing nitrogen loss in the aquifer, one using a constant-loss factor and the other time-dependent loss rates. The constant-loss method, which assumes that all similar land uses have the same per unit area loading rate to surface water regardless of location within the watershed, predicts that 42% of the nonpond watershed nitrogen load originated within the zero to 2 yr time-of-travel zone, which is 40% of the contributing area. The time-of-travel loss method calculates loss rates based on aquifer travel times and denitrification reaction kinetics, evaluated separately for carbon-unlimited and carbon-limited cases. Time-of-travel loss calculations for percent of nonpond load that originated within the area of < 2 yr aquifer residence time are 64% when carbon is not limiting, but only 49% when carbon limitation is included, not greatly different from the constant-loss method. A feature of the kinetics used is that carbon (and the denitrified nitrogen) is lost rather quickly in the aquifer travel path, after which carbon limitation stops denitrification altogether. Carbon limitation causes the time-of-travel loss model to approximate the constant-loss model such that in most of the watershed, a nearly constant fraction of the nitrogen input is lost in both models. © 2004 National Ground Water Association.",,"Carbon limitation; Coastal embayments; Constant-loss model; Contributing areas; Flow and transport; Fresh Water; Hydrologic analysis; Loading rate; Loss calculation; Loss factor; Loss model; Loss rates; Massachusetts; Nitrogen loads; Nitrogen loss; Nitrogen transport; Per unit; Residence time; Steady-state method; Time-dependent loss; Total nitrogen; Travel time; Aquifers; Denitrification; Landforms; Reaction rates; Surface waters; Watersheds; Nitrogen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-37549004003

They range in thickness from 30 to 200 m, and represent sedimentation on top of ephemeral structural highs related to blind faults. Sediments are made up of hemipelagites and fine-grained turbidites, and include 13C-depleted carbonates, related to the rising of methane-rich fluids (hydrocarbon seep-carbonates). Large portions of pelitic intervals are involved in chaotic masses by soft sediment deformation (slumps, slides, intraformational breccias), revealing an intense sediment instability during middle Miocene. A stratigraphic, mineralogic and geochemical study was conducted on two of these pelitic intervals (Castagno d'Andrea, Mt Citerna) in order to reconstruct carbonate development, the composition of fluids, and to document the connections between fluid seepage and syndepositional tectonics. This multidisciplinary approach has allowed us to discriminate between the two examined pelitic intervals in terms of age, depositional rates and conditions, organic carbon and post-depositional processes.Seep-carbonates are characterized by chemosymbiotic fossil communities, autoclastic fractures and brecciation; carbonate bodies show complex facies relationships, as indicative of different stages in chemoherm growth. The compositional study evidences the peculiar chemistry of chemoherm carbonates (calcite low in Mg and Sr) compared with carbonates in associated enclosing pelites and with modern chemoherms, in general. The non-carbonate components within the chemoherms are enriched in detrital minerals and depleted in phyllosilicates with respect to the enclosing pelites. The mineralogical changes in the clay component within the brecciated unit of the Castagno d'Andrea chemoherms suggest authigenic precipitation of the Mg-rich phases. Isotopic analyses show the distinct carbon signature in the chemoherms from the two examined intervals (Castagno d'Andrea chemoherms more depleted, from -15.8‰ up to -41.3‰ PDB, than Mt Citerna, from -5.2‰ up to -16.7‰), and the transitional 13C-depletion trend observed moving from chemoherms to the enclosing pelites (moderately depleted) and Te (Bouma sequence) turbidites (in the range of marine carbonates).

Based on a recently completed emission inventory study for three counties in central Florida, the major source by far of anthropogenic VOCs and NOx was on-road mobile sources, even though other sources (such as construction equipment, lawn and garden equipment, and various point sources) were also significant. Although there is specific guidance for conducting an ozone-season inventory for mobile sources, there is a lack of detailed guidance as to how to employ the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) latest mobile source emission factor program, MOBILE6, for an annual inventory. Several of the MOBILE6 inputs that significantly influence emission factors (e.g., temperature) can vary widely throughout the year, and the annual average value may not be appropriate. Rather, it may be better to utilize monthly values of these parameters. This paper investigated the sensitivity of the annual emission inventory results to using annual or monthly values of temperature, Reid Vapor Pressure of gasoline, and humidity. The results show that, for a three-county area in central Florida representing metropolitan Orlando, the annual emission inventory based on the sum of individual monthly averages is not significantly different from that calculated using one set of annual average inputs to MOBILE6. © 2004 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"Atmospheric humidity; Environmental protection; Gasoline; Industrial emissions; Nitrates; Ozone; Volatile organic compounds; Emission inventories; Lawn and garden equipment; Waste management; gasoline; nitrogen oxide; volatile organic compound; air pollution indicator; article; building material; equipment; exhaust gas; health program; humidity; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; statistical significance; United States; urban area; vapor pressure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043184261

This particular time is critical because of the combination of three factors: (1) simultaneous departure of many buses and trains, (2) cold engines, and, quite frequently, (3) stable meteorological conditions. In our approach, we use ARIA Local™, a simulation package applying CFD tools to air pollution modeling, to study different scenarios. The CFD model used in this study is the MERCURE model, developed by Electricité de France. For a bus station, we simulate a typical morning peak hour situation and study in detail how the pollution is accumulated in the station courtyard and the impact on the close vicinity. Two scenarios are presented: one with classical diesel engine and one with buses using AQUAZOL® or NGV fuel. The definition of the sources inside the Eulerian grid is described as static linear sources. The total emission is averaged over the mean path driven by the bus from the bus stop to the exit of the bus station. For a railway station, we simulate a situation in a real railway station within the city of Paris. The emission from a diesel ""locomotive"" and its impact on air quality is computed and compared to the impact of other nonmobile emissions. In this case, the definition of sources is described as mobile point sources following the trajectory of the train. These two scenarios are discussed in an urban context, taking into account the flow around buildings and different meteorological conditions. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Bus station; Eulerian CFD model; Microscale simulations; Railway station","Air quality; Computational fluid dynamics; Computer simulation; Diesel engines; Mathematical models; Particulate emissions; Railroad stations; Bus stations; Cold engines; Eulerian grids; Meteorological conditions; Air pollution; air quality; atmospheric pollution; bus transport; pollution monitoring; railway transport; air pollution; article; diesel engine; exhaust gas; meteorology; priority journal; railway; simulation; theoretical model; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7044233366

Herbivory and litter decomposition are key controllers of ecosystem carbon and nutrient cycling. We hypothesized that foliar defences of plant species against vertebrate herbivores would reduce leaf digestibility and would subsequently, through 'afterlife effects', reduce litter decomposability. 2. We tested this hypothesis by screening 32 subarctic plant species, belonging to eight types in terms of life form and nutrient economy strategy, for (1) leaf digestibility in cow rumen juice; (2) biochemical and structural traits that might explain variation in digestibility; and (3) litter mass loss during simultaneous incubation in an outdoor subarctic litter bed. 3. Interspecific variation in green-leaf digestibility corresponded significantly with that in litter decomposability; this relationship was strongly driven by overall variation among the eight plant types (r = 0.92). The same relationship was not detectable within plant types in taxonomic relatedness tests. 4. Several biochemical and structural parameters (phenol-to-N ratio, lignin-to-N ratio) explained a significant part of the variation in leaf digestibility, but again only between and not within plant types. 5. Our results provide further support for the role played by foliar defence in the link between plant and soil via the decomposition pathway. They are also a new example of the potential control of plant functional types over carbon and nutrient dynamics in ecosystems.","Antiherbivore defence; Arctic; Biochemistry; Decomposition; Plant functional type","antiherbivore defense; decomposition; digestibility; leaf; litter; subarctic region; Vertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144309690

Two different strategies were used: one with the molecules confined to the electrode surface and a second with DgAOR. in solution. In all of the cases studied, electron transfer took place, although different redox reactions were responsible for the voltammetric signal. From a thorough analysis of the voltammetric responses and the structural properties of the molecular surface of DgAOR, the redox reaction at the carbon electrodes could be assigned to the reduction of the more exposed iron cluster, [2Fe-2S] II, whereas reduction of the molybdopterin cofactor occurs at the gold electrode.

Slab carbonates reveal portions of the carbonate growth sequence not seen in the rosettes and suggest that initial nucleating compositions were calcite-rich. The kinetically controlled growth of rosettes and slab carbonates was followed by an alteration event that formed the magnesite-siderite layers on the exterior surfaces of the carbonate. Post-slab magnesite, intimately associated with silica glass, is compositionally similar to the magnesite in these exterior layers but represents a later generation of carbonate growth.

The wide diversity of these exposure scenarios and potential for regional transport present the health scientist with a challenge of how to appropriately address complex air pollution mixtures. Similarly, regulators are faced with mixture issues ranging from exposures, to health outcomes, and to associated uncertainties that are in need of more definitive and strategic information to support informed decisions. This article provides a perspective of an empiricist on the background related to the issue of air pollution mixtures. Historic and current regulatory platforms for dealing with mixtures are described. Using the topic of particulate air pollution, general guidance through the nuances of potential interactions among PM constituents is provided, along with alterative approaches and examples, and how these support scientific and regulatory agendas. The impact of new cell and molecular technologies is inevitable, and we must be prepared to take advantage of these and other cross-cutting methods as they become available. Such innovative approaches hold the secret to high-throughput biologic dissection of component interactions and mixture profiles, which will aid in the assessment of risk.",,"irritant agent; air pollutant; air pollution; air quality; conference paper; empirical research; environmental exposure; human; mathematical computing; molecular interaction; particulate matter; priority journal; Air Pollutants; Bias (Epidemiology); Environmental Monitoring; Government Regulation; Humans; Inhalation Exposure; Maximum Allowable Concentration; Models, Statistical; Reproducibility of Results; Risk Assessment; United States; United States Environmental Protection Agency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642492870

Here we present the major findings from a national scale air pollution assessment that is part of the United States' 2003 Report on Sustainable Forests. We examine trends and the percent forest subjected to specific levels of ozone and wet deposition of sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium. Results are reported by Resource Planning Act (RPA) reporting region and integrated by forest type using multivariate clustering. Estimates of sulfate deposition for forested areas had decreasing trends (1994-2000) across RPA regions that were statistically significant for North and South RPA regions. Nitrate deposition rates were relatively constant for the 1994 to 2000 period, but the South RPA region had a statistically decreasing trend. The North and South RPA regions experienced the highest ammonium deposition rates and showed slightly decreasing trends. Ozone concentrations were highest in portions of the Pacific Coast RPA region and relatively high across much of the South RPA region. Both the South and Rocky Mountain RPA regions had an increasing trend in ozone exposure. Ozone-induced foliar injury to sensitive species was recorded in all regions except for the Rocky Mountain region. The multivariate analysis showed that the oak-hickory and loblolly-shortleaf pine forest types were generally exposed to more air pollution than other forest types, and the redwood, western white pine, and larch forest types were generally exposed to less. These findings offer a new approach to national air pollution assessments and are intended to help focus research and planning initiatives related to air pollution and forest health. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Acid deposition; Forest health and vitality; Multivariate clustering; Ozone biomonitoring; Spatial analysis; Sustainable forests; Tropospheric ozone","Forestry; Nitrates; Ozone; Planning; Statistical methods; Forest health; Multivariate analysis; Air pollution; ammonia; nitrate; ozone; sulfate; nitrate; ozone; quaternary ammonium derivative; sulfate; acid deposition; atmospheric pollution; biomonitoring; forest health; Montreal Protocol; ozone; troposphere; air pollutant; air pollution; air pollution indicator; article; biological monitoring; concentration (parameters); environmental exposure; environmental impact assessment; forest; geography; leaf damage; multivariate analysis; pine; rating scale; risk assessment; Sequoia; statistical analysis; United States; wet deposition; acid rain; air pollutant; Canada; cluster analysis; environmental health; environmental monitoring; methodology; tree; North America; United States; Carya; Larix; Pinus echinata; Pinus monticola; Quercus; Sequoia sempervirens; Acid Rain; Air Pollutants; Canada; Cluster Analysis; Environmental Health; Environmental Monitoring; Multivariate Analysis; Nitrates; Ozone; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Sulfates; Trees; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942620710

We contrasted HadCM3LC simulations of Amazonian forest at the last glacial maximum (LGM; 21 kyr ago) and a Younger Dryas-like period (13-12 kyr ago) with predicted responses of future warming to provide estimates of the climatic limits under which the Amazon forest remains relatively stable. Our simulations indicate that despite lower atmospheric CO2 concentrations and increased aridity during the LGM, Amazonia remains mostly forested, and that the cooling climate of the Younger Dryas-like period in fact causes a trend toward increased above-ground carbon balance relative to today. The vegetation feedbacks responsible for maintaining forest integrity in past climates (i.e. decreased evapotranspiration and reduced plant respiration) cannot be maintained into the future. Although elevated atmospheric CO2 contributes to a positive enhancement of plant carbon and water balance, decreased stomatal conductance and increased plant and soil respiration cause a positive feedback that amplifies localized drying and climate warming. We speculate that the Amazonian forest is currently near its critical resiliency threshold, and that even minor climate warming may be sufficient to promote deleterious feedbacks on forest integrity.","Amazon Basin; Carbon balance; Last glacial maximum; Palaeovegetation modelling; Rainforest resiliency; Younger Dryas","carbon balance; climate modeling; global change; paleobotany; paleoclimate; rainforest; Amazonia; South America",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642278877

Advance epidemic warning would give health services an opportunity to prepare. Because malaria transmission is largely limited by climate, climate-based epidemic warning systems are a real possibility. To develop and test such a system, good long-term malaria and climate data are needed. In KwaZulu-Natal (KZN), South Africa, 30 years of confirmed malaria case data provide a unique opportunity to examine short- and long-term trends. We analysed seasonal case totals and seasonal changes in cases (both log-transformed) against a range of climatic indicators obtained from three weather stations in the highest malaria incidence districts, using linear regression analysis. Seasonal changes in case numbers (delta log cases, dlc) were significantly associated with several climate variables. The two most significant ones were mean maximum daily temperatures from January to October of the preceding season (n = 30, r2 = 0.364, P = 0.0004) and total rainfall during the current summer months of November-March (n = 30, r2 = 0.282, P = 0.003). These two variables, when entered into the same regression model, together explained 49.7% of the total variation in dlc. We found no evidence of association between case totals and climate. In KZN, where malaria control operations are intense, climate appears to drive the interannual variation of malaria incidence, but not its overall level. The accompanying paper provides evidence that overall levels are associated with non-climatic factors such as drug resistance and possibly HIV prevalence.","Climate; Disease outbreaks; Disease reservoirs; Environment; Incidence; Malaria; Risk factors; Risk seasons; South Africa; Transmission","climate effect; disease control; health risk; malaria; risk factor; article; climate; controlled study; correlation analysis; data analysis; disease association; health survey; human; incidence; infection prevention; linear regression analysis; long term care; major clinical study; malaria; season; South Africa; statistical significance; summer; Climate; Disease Outbreaks; Humans; Incidence; Linear Models; Malaria; Rain; Risk Factors; Seasons; South Africa; Temperature; Africa; Eastern Hemisphere; KwaZulu-Natal; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144311134

Neutral and ionized lines originated both by species deriving from the target and from the air environment were analysed. The temperature and electron density values were estimated in all the experimental conditions. A different behavior of the plasma emission versus the air pressure, in the case of lines deriving from the target, was observed in the single-pulse and double-pulse configurations, suggesting that the different environmental conditions in the first and the second laser ablation may be responsible in determining the plasma emission in the two cases. An interpretative model based on the cavity produced in air by the laser-induced shock wave, according to the Sedov theory of the blast wave expansion, was able to qualitatively describe the effects observed in single-pulse and double-pulse experiments. Besides, the influence of the interpulse delay time between the two laser pulses was explored in the range between 0 and 20 μs. The results, according to the model proposed, provide information on the plume evolution in the single-pulse and double-pulse configurations at different air pressures. In particular, different optimum interpulse delays were found for the observation of neutral lines and ionic lines. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Several attempts to quantify the role of DMS in climate change have been undertaken in modeling studies. We examine a model of biogenic DMS production and describe its endogenous dynamics and sensitivities. We extend the model to develop a one-dimensional version that more accurately resolves the important processes of the mixed layer in determining the ecosystem dynamics. Comparisons of the results of the one-dimensional model with an empirical relationship that describes the global distribution of DMS, and also with vertical profiles of DMS in the upper ocean measured at the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series, suggest that the model represents the interaction between the biological and physical processes well on local and global scales. Our analysis of the model confirms its veracity and provides insights into the important processes determining DMS concentration in the oceans.

The ESCOMPTE program is used to produce a relevant set of data for testing and evaluating regional pollution models. It includes high-resolution (in space and time) atmospheric emission inventories and field experiments, and covers an area of 120×120 km, centered over the Marseilles-Berre area in the southeast of France during Summer 2001. This region presents a high occurrence of photochemical pollution events, which result from numerous industrial and urban sources of primary pollutants. From the dynamical characteristics of the area, sea-breeze circulation and channeling effects due to terrain features highly influence the location of the pollutant plumes. ESCOMPTE will provide a highly documented framework for dynamics and chemistry studies. Campaign strategies and experimental set up are described. During the planning phase, existing modeling results helped defining the experimental design. The campaign involved surface measurement networks, remote sensing, ship-borne, balloon-borne, and airplane measurements. Mean standard meteorological parameters and turbulent fluxes, ozone, ozone precursors, photochemically active trace gases, and aerosols were measured. Five intensive observation periods (IOPs) were documented using a wide spectrum of instruments, involving aircraft (7) (one of them equipped with a Doppler lidar, the others for in situ meteorological and chemical measurements), constant volume balloons (33), ozone lidars (5), wind profilers (15 sodars and radars), Doppler scanning lidar (1), radiosonde systems (at 4 locations), instrumented ships (2). In addition to the air quality networks from environmental agencies, 15 supplementary ground stations equipped for chemistry and/or meteorology and/or surface flux measurements, were operational. All instruments were calibrated and compared during a Quality Control/Quality Assurance (QC/QA) week, at the very beginning of the campaign.Fifteen days were intensively documented during five IOPs, referenced as 1, 2a, 2b, 3, and 4. High pollution levels were encountered during sea-breeze conditions observed during IOPs 2b and 3, whereas IOPs 2a and 4 corresponded to moderate wind, and channeled plume regimes. In addition, hourly emissions inventories for all IOPs were established to complete data sets and to finalize the ESCOMPTE database (EDB).Two other projects were associated to ESCOMPTE: urban boundary layer (UBL) and tropospheric water vapor content by GPS tomography (GPS/H2O). They took advantage of the scientific environment provided by ESCOMPTE. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

It is argued that, due to the Arctic region's island-like status concerning environment, climate, geography, and cultural history, and due to an interdisciplinary Arctic research tradition, this region is particularly favourable to study and learn from, with regard to societies and climate change. Moreover, it is argued that societal response to climate fluctuations is best understood in an intergenerational time perspective and at large geographical scales, as can be provided in the deep archaeological time-scale within the Arctic world. From recent fieldwork in north-east Greenland, this area's prehistory is discussed in relation to climate change. This case is followed by a discussion of four aspects of Inuit prehistory of the eastern Arctic that are considered crucial to the Inuit adaptation and success during the centuries, i.e. (1) the initial Thule culture migration into the eastern Arctic; (2) breathing-hole sealing technology; (3) snow house technology; and (4) Inuit long-distance travels in the eighteenth century. In the chapter it is concluded that the Inuit did not invent new strategies or technologies in relation to stress induced e.g. by climate change. Instead they relied on an inherent flexibility in their living and being in the Arctic, involving high mobility and frequent migrations at the individual level, which enabled them to overcome crises caused by social conflicts as well as environmentally dependent changes. Further, it is concluded that the Inuit had an ability to creatively integrate technologies and life-ways resulting from their cultural encounters, e.g. with people from the Late Dorset culture, European whalers, and Moravians, that were successfully employed when climatic-induced environmental changes affected their life and societies. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925671072

On the other hand, we indicated that a third flow component shows up in the reaction plane as an enhanced emission, which is orthogonal to the directed flow. This is not shadowed by the deflected projectile and target, and shows up at measurable rapidities, ycm = 1 - 2. To study the formation of this effect initial stages of relativistic heavy ion collisions are studied. An effective string rope model is presented for heavy ion collisions at RHIC energies. Our model takes into account baryon recoil for both target and projectile, arising from the acceleration of partons in an effective field. The typical field strength (string tension) for RHIC energies is about 5-12 GeV/fm, what allows us to talk about ""string ropes"". The results show that QGP forms a tilted disk, such that the direction of the largest pressure gradient stays in the reaction plane, but deviates from both the beam and the usual transverse flow directions. The produced initial state can be used as an initial condition for further hydrodynamical calculations. Such initial conditions lead to the creation of third flow component. Recent v1 measurements are promising that this effect can be used as a diagnostic tool of the QGP. Collective flow is sensitive to the early stages of system evolution. To study the sensitivity of the flow signal, we have calculated flow harmonics from a Blast Wave model, a tilted, ellipsoidally expanding source. We studied recent experimental techniques used for calculation of the vn Fourier coefficients and pointed out a few possible problems connected to these techniques, which may impair the sensitivity of flow analysis. © 2004 American Institute of Physics.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85020756218

The films were grown in a rotation mode over a carbon and a silicon targets in a mixed Ar/N2 atmosphere. The substrates were held at a substrate temperature of 573 K. The argon flow was kept constant (100 sccm) and the nitrogen flow was 20 sccm or 25 sccm, in each one of the two series of produced films, resulting in a working pressure at approximately 0.5 Pa. The substrate bias varied between grounded and -100 V. The films were analysed with respect to microstructure, state of chemical bonding and optical properties by X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman spectroscopy (RS), optical reflectance and transmittance. Raman spectroscopy was used as a probe of microstructural modifications induced by deposition conditions. The main features observed in RS spectra are the well-known D- and G-bands characteristic of amorphous carbon materials. The position, widths and intensity ratio of these bands are found to be dependent of the films deposition conditions. The refractive index, absorption coefficient, optical band gap and also the thickness were calculated from transmittance spectra obtained between 200 and 2500 nm. The residual stress of the coatings depends on deposition conditions and was calculated by measuring the substrate curvature before and after film deposition. The curvature of the samples was measured by laser triangulation in two series of two orthogonal directions. All coatings were in a state of compressive residual stress. The average hardness and Young's modulus of the produced coatings is approximately 16 GPa and 170 GPa, respectively. The nano-hardness of the grounded produced samples presented values approximately 30% lower. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Ctr., University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States","This study expands on recent work linking intraseasonal-to-seasonal variability in observed precipitation and wind from September to March in the eastern Indian Ocean with the initiation of El Niño events during the last 25 years. First, westerly wind burst (WWB) events are defined as days when westerly wind speeds averaged over 5°-15°S and 70°-100°E were greater than 1.5 standard deviations from the mean. The number of WWB days from September to March was high before the onset of the 1982-1983, 1991-1992, 1997-1998, and 2002-2003 El Niñ o events, but not the 1986-1987 El Niño. This study suggests that for the 1979-2002 period, variations in precipitation in the eastern Indian Ocean is a more robust predictor of El Niño onset than analyzed winds. On the basis of the work of Curtis et al. [2002], a real-time precipitation-based El Niño Onset Index is presented, which during the austral summer of 2001-2002 successfully predicted the 2002-2003 El Niño. The index focuses on the magnitude of 30-60 day oscillations and mean conditions in the precipitation field. Case studies of high-resolution satellite-based data sets of precipitation, wind, and sea surface temperature (SST) for the 2001-2002 season are examined to better understand how events in the Indian Ocean are linked to Pacific Ocean wind disturbances and SST changes. Twice during this season maxima in precipitation and zonal winds propagated eastward, the first near the equator and the second to the south. For the southern case, warm waters preceded heavy precipitation in the eastern Indian Ocean, which preceded strong westerly winds. A cooling of the sea surface followed the wind-rain system. This sequence of events moved through the ocean passage between Indonesia and Australia, suggesting a coupling of convection, wind, and sea surface temperatures on the timescale of days. These case studies provide a basis for how the east Indian Ocean variations are linked to subsequent events in the Pacific Ocean, including the initiation of El Niño events.

As nonlimited emissions the nanoparticulate emissions at cold and warm operating conditions were measured by means of SMPS, ELPI and NanoMet ∗). The measurements were both: at steady state and at transient operating conditions. It can be stated, that the TSDI-technology offers advantages of lower gaseous and particulate emissions. It reaches about the level of 4-S vehicles. Since the particulate emission of the 2-S consists mainly of lube oil condensates the minimization of oil consumption stays still an important goal. Further improvements of oil &amp; fuel quality, as well as optimisation of catalysts can also contribute to a reduction of particulate matter and particle counts.",,"Air quality; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Shape memory effect; Vehicles; European cities; European project; Nano particulates; Operating condition; Particulate Matter; Research programs; Swiss Federal Office; Transient operating condition; Direct injection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85028772443

Thus, tropical areas such as the ""Cerrado"" region in Brazil, with an area of 204 million ha and of around 50 million ha of cultivated pastures, most of them with African grasses, are considered potential areas to sink carbon. Total carbon in soil profile was used to compare carbon accumulation among cultivated and native pastures on a Dark Red Latosol (Typic Haplortox) found in the ""Cerrado"" region, Brazil. Soil samples taken at 1.0 m deep were analyzed in seven different fields: native pasture (1), Panicum maximum (2), Brachiaria decumbens (3), Brachiaria brizantha+Stylosanthes guianensis (4), Andropogon gayanus+Neonotonia wightii+Centrosema brasilianum (5), two seed production fields, B. brizantha (6) and Paspalum atratum (7). Forage dry matter production was also evaluated at each field. All cultivated pastures were over three years old and grazed under different stocking rates, except for fields 6 and 7, which were not grazed. Dry matter production was higher in fields 6 and 7 and lower in fields 1, 3 and 5. An ongoing degradation process was detected in fields 3 and 5. Carbon storage amounted to 100 Mg ha-1 in 1 and ranged from 97 Mg ha-1 in 3 to 113 Mg ha-1 in 2, 6 and 7. Pastures in fields 3 and 5 (low shoot dry matter production and low fertility status), had less soil carbon than fields 6 and 7 (higher shoot dry matter production and better fertility status). Total soil carbon and forage dry matter production showed a high correlation (0.83, P&lt;0.02), demonstrating that carbon accumulation was dependent on shoot biomass production, which is a result of the soil fertility status. Presently, most of the 50 million ha of cultivated pastures in the ""Cerrado"" region have been poorly fertilized and unadequately grazed. Results from this study showed that soil carbon accumulation in degraded pastures or in those under an ongoing degradation process does not contribute significantly to the sinking of atmospheric CO2 as well as to the reduction of greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

If the US and world follow through on their long-term commitment to dramatically reduce emissions, this pressure will become significant over the coming decades. It is in the face of these concerns that the future of US fossil-fired power plants is examined. There are over 1337 operational fossil-fired power generating units of at least 100 MW in capacity that began operating between the early 1940s and today in the continental US. Together these units provide some 453 GW of electric power. Rapidly retiring this still valuable capital stock or undertaking large-scale immediate redevelopment with advanced power cycles as a means of addressing their greenhouse gas emissions will not be a sensible option for all of these units. Considering a conservative 40-year operating life, there are over 667 existing fossil-fired power plants, representing a capacity of over 291 GW, that have at least a decade's worth of productive life remaining. Applying Battelle's specialized analysis tools, relationships between these 667 plants and their technology type, location, emissions, and vintage have been explored. Based on these factors and the proximity of these plants to geologic reservoirs with potential for sequestering large volumes of CO2, the average costs for retrofitting these newer-vintage plants with capture technology and sequestering their CO2 into such reservoirs are presented.

In these runs, the oceans were initialized to 1995 conditions by a group from the Scripps Institution of Oceanography and other institutions. An ensemble of three model runs was then carried out to the year 2099 using the projected forcing. Atmospheric data from these runs were saved at 6-hourly intervals (hourly for certain critical fields) to support the ACPI objective of accurately modeling hydrological cycles over the western U.S. It is shown that the initialization to 1995 conditions partly removes the un-forced oceanic temperature and salinity drifts that occurred in the standard 20th century integration. The ACPI runs show a global surface temperature increase of 3-8°C over northern high-latitudes by the end of the 21st century, and 1-2°C over the oceans. This is generally within ±0.1°C of model runs without the 1995 ocean initialization. The exception is in the Antarctic circumpolar ocean where surface air temperature is cooler in the ACPI run; however the ensemble scatter is large in this region. Although the difference in climate at the end of the 21st century is minimal between the ACPI runs and traditionally spun up runs, it might be larger for CGCMs with higher climate sensitivity or larger ocean drifts. Our results suggest that the effect of small errors in the oceans (such as those associated with climate drifts) on CGCM-simulated climate changes for the next 50-100 years may be negligible.",,"Computer simulation; Error analysis; Greenhouse effect; Oceanography; Sensitivity analysis; Thermal effects; Weather forecasting; Global climate response; Parallel climate model (PCM); Climate change; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; climate modeling; hydrological cycle; sensitivity analysis; twenty first century",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542321480

Reduction of carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) by synthetic magnetite was examined in batch reactors to evaluate the pH dependence of the reaction rates and product distributions. This work presents the first data where magnetite promotes CCl4 dechlorination independent of added sorbed Fe(II) or coexisting minerals that maintained Fe2+ above the magnetite solubility limit. In this system, reaction rate constants increase with increasing pH values between 6 and 10. The pH dependence is explained by acid-base equilibrium between two surface sites, where the more deprotonated exhibits greater dechlorination reactivity. The distribution of reaction products was also found to depend on pH. The primary reaction product is carbon monoxide (CO) followed by chloroform (CHCl3). CHCl3 production is at a minimum at pH 6 but increases through pH 10. Formation rate constants for both products increase with increasing pH, but the values for CHCl3 increase at a much faster rate. A hypothesis is proposed that relates the CHCl3 rate enhancement to the reduced capacity of deprotonated surface sites to stabilize the trichlorocarbanion transition-state complex. These data form a basis to assess the natural attenuation capacity of magnetite formed under iron reducing conditions. Application of this information to permeable barrier technology suggests that, in the long term, oxidation of ZVI to magnetite may be accompanied by a shift toward more benign reaction products as well as a 2 order of magnitude decrease in reaction rate constants.",,"Attenuation; Bacteria; Carbon monoxide; Corrosion; Magnetite; pH effects; Rate constants; Acid base equilibrium; Batch reactors; Iron reducing bacteria; Surface sites; Carbon tetrachloride; carbon monoxide; carbon tetrachloride; chloride; chloroform; iron; magnetite; mineral; trichlorocarbanion; unclassified drug; dechlorination; magnetite; pH; acid base balance; acidity; alkalinity; article; attenuation; dechlorination; oxidation; permeability barrier; proton transport; reduction; solubility; Carbon Tetrachloride; Chloroform; Ferrosoferric Oxide; Ferrous Compounds; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Iron; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544346062

The sliding wear behavior of the 2014 Al-30 vol.% Cf composite and 2014 Al matrix alloy was investigated using pin on ring wear test apparatus in the load range of 10-550 N and sliding speed of 0.65 ms-1. The results indicate that the incorporation of carbon fibers into 2014 Al alloy significantly improves the wear resistance, serves to suppress the transition to a severe wear rate regime and impedes the transition to a higher load (300 N) in comparison to the unreinforced alloy (100 N). Also, the composite exhibits a higher seizure resistance compared to the unreinforced alloy where the unreinforced alloy seized at load of 160 N and composite at load of 550 N. SEM micrographs and EDXA of the composite worn surface reveals that the surface is covered by graphite film, which prevents a metal-to-metal contact and acts as a solid lubricant, resulting in improvement in the wear and seizure resistance of the composite. Subsurface studies show that the carbon fibers tend to reduce the extent of plastic deformation in the subsurface region, thereby delaying the nucleation and propagation of subsurface microcracks. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Superficially, the open ocean appears homogeneous, with few clear barriers to gene flow, allowing extensive, even global, dispersal. Yet, despite the apparent lack of opportunity for genetic isolation, diversity is prevalent within marine taxa. A lack of candidate isolating mechanisms would seem to favor sympatric over allopatric speciation models to explain the diversity and biogeographic patterns observed in the oceans today. However, the ocean is a dynamic system, and both current and past circulation patterns must be considered in concert to gain a true perspective of gene flow through time. We have derived a comprehensive picture of the mechanisms potentially at play in the high latitudes by combining molecular, biogeographic, fossil, and paleoceanographic data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of the polar planktonic foraminifer Neogloboquadrina pachyderma sinistral. We have discovered extensive genetic diversity within this morphospecies and that its current ""extreme"" polar affinity did not appear until late in its evolutionary history. The molecular data demonstrate a stepwise progression of diversification starting with the allopatric isolation of Atlantic Arctic and Antarctic populations after the onset of the Northern Hemisphere glaciation. Further diversification occurred only in the Southern Hemisphere and seems to have been linked to glacial-interglacial climate dynamics. Our findings demonstrate the role of Quaternary climate instability in shaping the modern high-latitude plankton. The divergent evolutionary history of N. pachyderma sinistral genotypes implies that paleoceanographic proxies based on this taxon should be calibrated independently.",,"allopatry; article; biogeography; climate; fossil; genetic variability; geographic distribution; latitude; molecular evolution; Neogloboquadrina pachyderma; nonhuman; ocean environment; paleoceanography; pelagic zone; plankton; priority journal; species differentiation; species diversity; Animals; Antarctic Regions; Arctic Regions; Base Sequence; Climate; Evolution, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Phylogeny; Plankton; Protozoa; Foraminifera; Neogloboquadrina; Neogloboquadrina pachyderma; Protista",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442650351

Off the Rhone River, the main terrestrial (river POM) and marine (seawater POM) sources of carbon differed in δ13C (-26.11‰ and -22.36‰, respectively). Surface sediment and suspended POM in plume water exhibited low δ13C (-24.38δ and -24.70δ, respectively) that differed more from the seawater POM than from river POM, demonstrating the dominance of terrestrial material in those carbon pools. Benthic invertebrates showed a wide range in δ15N (mean 4.30‰ to 9.77‰) and δ13C (mean -23.81‰ to -18.47‰), suggesting different trophic levels, diets and organic sources. Among the macroinvertebrates, the surface (mean δ13C -23.71‰) and subsurface (mean δ13C -23.81‰) deposit-feeding polychaetes were particularly 13C depleted, indicating that their carbon was mainly derived from terrestrial material. In flatfish, δ 15N (mean 9.42 to 10.93‰) and δ13C (mean -19.95‰, to -17.69‰) varied among species, indicating differences in food source and terrestrial POM use. A significant negative correlation was observed between the percentage by weight of polychaetes in the diet and the δ13C of flatfish white muscle. Solea solea (the main polychaete feeder) had the lowest mean δ13C, Arnoglossus laterna and Buglossidium luteum (crustacean, mollusc and polychaete feeders) had intermediate values, and Solea impar (mollusc feeder) and Citharus linguatula (crustacean and fish feeder) exhibited the highest δ 13C. Two different benthic food webs were thus identified off the Rhone River, one based on marine planktonic carbon and the other on the terrestrial POM carried by the river. Deposit-feeding polychaetes were responsible for the main transfer of terrestrial POM to upper trophic levels, linking sole population dynamics to river runoff fluctuations.","Carbon; Flatfishes; Macrobenthic communities; Nitrogen; Terrestrial organic matter","carbon; nitrogen; carbon; coastal fishery; flatfish; nitrogen; particulate organic matter; river discharge; runoff; stable isotope; terrigenous deposit; yield; zoobenthos; animal; article; climate; environmental monitoring; fish; food chain; food industry; invertebrate; Mediterranean Sea; population dynamics; river; water pollutant; Animals; Carbon Isotopes; Climate; Environmental Monitoring; Fisheries; Fishes; Food Chain; Invertebrates; Mediterranean Sea; Nitrogen Isotopes; Population Dynamics; Rivers; Water Pollutants; Gulf of Lion; Mediterranean Sea; Animalia; Arnoglossus; Arnoglossus laterna; Buglossidium luteum; Citharus linguatula; Crustacea; Invertebrata; Mollusca; Panthera leo; Pleuronectiformes; Polychaeta; Solea; Solea impar; Solea solea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1342331064

This is an on-line model (integrated within the Canadian operational environmental forecasting and data assimilation system) which can be used to understand the role of meteorology in mercury cycling (atmospheric pathways), the inter-annual variability of mercury and can be evaluated against observations on global scales. This is due to the fact that the model uses a combination of actual observed and predicted meteorological state of the atmosphere at high resolution to integrate the model as opposed to the climatological approach used in existing global mercury models. The model was integrated and evaluated on global scale using only anthropogenic emissions. North to south gradients in mercury concentrations, seasonal variability, dry and wet deposition and vertical structure are well simulated by the model. The model was used to explain the observed seasonal variations in atmospheric mercury circulation.

On six of those days the aircraft sampled plumes exhibiting O3 concentrations in excess of 150 ppbv at a number of different locations in and around the greater Houston area. The composition of these plumes differed significantly from those typically observed in other urban. areas, exhibiting unusually high concentrations of hydrocarbon oxidation products such as HCHO and photochemical product species such as peroxides. Estimates of the integrated formation efficiency Of O 3 with respect to NOx, OPEx, indicate that O3 had been formed in these high concentration plumes with efficiencies ranging between 6.4 and 11 ppbv O3 per ppbv of NOx consumed. Without exception, back trajectories from the locations where these high O3 plumes were observed passed over, or in close proximity to, sources of NOx and hydrocarbons surrounding the Houston Ship Channel. Calculations of instantaneous ozone formation rates and efficiencies using a box model constrained by measurements of stable species showed that ozone formation over and around the Houston Ship Channel could be very rapid (instantaneous rates up to 140 ppbv/h) and very efficient (OPEx up to 28 and, in some instances, limited by the availability of NOx. High concentrations of reactive hydrocarbons and NOx emitted by industries in this area appeared to be the cause of these high rates and efficiencies. Examination of the distribution of photochemical product distributions in the high O3 plumes arising from Ship Channel emissions suggests that O3 formation in these plumes was much more NOx limited than in typical urban plumes at equivalent times in their evolution. However, chemical/transport model simulations with realistic emissions inventories are needed to resolve the question of whether a NOx- or hydrocarbon-based control strategy would be most effective at controlling greater Houston O 3 concentrations.

The observed winter-dominant warming pattern, which has been linked to increasing greenhouse-gas concentrations, has led some researchers to propose future mortality decreases, while others contend that increasing heat-related mortality in summer will more than offset any winter-mortality reductions. Because winter mortality is only weakly linked to daily weather, we examine the seasonality of mortality using monthly data for 28 major US cities from 1964 to 1998. Daily all-causes mortality counts are age-standardized, aggregated monthly, and related to mean monthly 07:00 h local standard time (LST) air temperature in each city. The climate-mortality seasonality patterns are examined for spatial and temporal (decadal-scale) variability, and the impact of climate change on mortality rates is investigated after an approximation of the inherent technology/adaptation trend is removed from the monthly time series. Mortality seasonality varies little between most US cities with comparable climates. By the 1990s, monthly mortality anomalies were similar between all cities regardless of climate, suggesting there is no net mortality benefit to be derived from a location's climate. After removing the impact of long-term declining mortality rates, some statistically significant monthly climate-mortality relationships remain in most cities, with generally positive temperature-mortality relationships in summer and negative relationships in winter. Future mortality could be reduced with a winter-dominant warming but increase with pronounced summer warming. In each case, however, net future climate-related mortality rates are very low relative to the baseline death rate, indicating that climate change will have little impact in defining future mortality patterns in US cities. © Inter-Research 2004.","Climate change; Human mortality; Seosonality; United States","climate change; environmental impact; mortality; seasonality; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344617973

These fertilizers could potentially enhance crop growth for sequestration of CO2 and reduce NOx contamination of groundwater. The process also showed promise that it could remove SOx and NOx, enhance sequestration of carbon into soils; providing an ideal ""Enriched Carbon, Organic Slow-release Sequestering"" fertilizer and nutrient carrier for plant growth. This process simultaneously produced a zero emissions fuel that could be used to operate farm machinery and provide electricity for rural users, agricultural irrigation pumps, and rural industrial parks.

Most of these vehicles use diesel oil and this situation causes dependence on oil, extensive greenhouse gas emissions and increasing air pollution in urban areas. In order to improve this situation the options for Brazilian cities include the use of alternative fuels and new propulsion technologies, such as hybrid vehicles. This article proposes a procedure for evaluating the performance of a recently developed Brazilian hybrid-drive technology. A simple procedure is presented to compare hybrid-drive buses with conventional diesel buses in urban operation focusing on fuel economy and the potential for reducing diesel oil consumption through the use of hybrid-drive buses. Field tests carried out by the authors indicate that fuel consumption improvement through the use of hybrid-drive buses would certainly exceed 20%, resulting in lower fuel costs and reduced carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Buses; Fuel economy; Fuel savings; Hybrid drives; Urban transit","Air pollution; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Fuel consumption; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse effect; Diesel oils; Greenhouse gas emissions; Hybrid-drive buses; Urban areas; Motor transportation; alternative fuel; bus transport; fuel consumption; traffic emission; Brazil; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344589346

Structural policies to control and reduce water scarcity, as water supply and demand management, should be seen as long-term planning, and thus must consider climate change and regional development. To this end, the present research proposes a model-based global change scenario. Water stress is assessed for 184 municipalities in Ceará between 2001 and 2025. For this purpose, four global change scenarios are developed, considering both global climate change and the effects of development policies. Climatic, hydrological, and water use models are applied and a proposed index computed for identification of long-term water stress. Application of the methodology in the focus area shows that, if no effective intervention measures are taken, up to almost 60 percent of the municipalities of the state may suffer under long-term water scarcity by 2025. On average, municipalities in the state of Ceará have a water shortage probability for the next 25 years ranging from 9 percent to 20 percent annually, depending on the scenario. The 10 percent most stressed municipalities have a probability of over 80 percent annually of facing water scarcity in the scenario period (25 years). Results also show that a decentralized development policy can compensate for the possible severe effects of climatic trends on future water availability over the scenario period. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Brazil; Global change; Scenarios; Semiarid; Water management; Water scarcity",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042571896

Two detections have been obtained: the already known water maser emission in K3-35, and a new cluster of masers in IRAS 17347-3139. This low rate of detections is compatible with the short lifetime of water molecules in PNe (∼100 yr). The water maser cluster at IRAS 17347-3139 are distributed on a ellipse of size ∼0″.2 × 0″.1, spatially associated with compact 1.3 cm continuum emission (simultaneously observed with the VLA). From archive VLA continuum data at 4.9, 8.4, and 14.9 GHz, a spectral index α = 0.76 ± 0.03 (Sv ∝ va) is derived for this radio source, which is consistent with either a partially optically thick ionized region or an ionized wind. However, the latter scenario can be ruled out by mass-loss considerations, thus indicating that this source is probably a young PN. The spatial distribution and the radial velocities of the water masers are suggestive of a rotating and expanding maser ring, tracing the innermost regions of a torus formed at the end of the asymptotic giant branch phase. Given that the 1.3 cm continuum emission peak is located near one of the tips of the major axis of the ellipse of masers, we speculate on a possible binary nature of IRAS 17347-3139, where the radio continuum emission could belong to one of the components and the water masers would be associated with a companion.","Masers; Planetary nebulae: general; Planetary nebulae: individual (IRAS 17347-3139, K3-35); Radio lines: ISM",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842585495

Directly extracted soil DNA was analysed with restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) by use of degenerated primers for the narG gene encoding the active site of the membrane-bound nitrate reductase. The corresponding enzyme activity of the nitrate reductase was determined colorimetrically after 24 h of anaerobic incubation. The narG PCR-RFLP fingerprints showed that the structure of the nitrate-reducing community was primarily affected by season and pH of the sampling site, whereas CO2 enrichment, plant species or fertiliser treatment had no apparent effect. In contrast, the nitrate reductase activity responded to N fertilisation, CO2 enrichment and plant species in October, whereas in June drought stress most likely kept the enzyme activity at a low level in all treatments.

The NO emission from plants is known since the 1970s, and now there is abundant information on the multiple effects of exogenously applied NO on different physiological and biochemical processes of plants. The physiological function of NO in plants mainly involves the induction of different processes, including the expression of defence-related genes against pathogens and apoptosis/programmed cell death (PCD), maturation and senescence, stomatal closure, seed germination, root development and the induction of ethylene emission. NO can be produced in plants by non-enzymatic and enzymatic systems. The NO-producing enzymes identified in plants are nitrate reductase, and several nitric oxide synthase-like activities, including one localized in peroxisomes which has been biochemically characterized. Recently, two genes of plant proteins with NOS activity have been isolated and characterized for the first time, and both proteins do not have sequence similarities to any mammalian NOS isoform. However, different evidence available indicate that there are other potential enzymatic sources of NO in plants, including xanthine oxidoreductase, peroxidase, cytochrome P450, and some hemeproteins. In plants, the enzymatic production of the signal molecule NO, either constitutive or induced by different biotic/abiotic stresses, may be a much more common event than was initially thought. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Over three quarters of respondents (n=184) felt they did not have access to the best information about the impacts of climate change on their areas. Although up-to-date information is freely available from a number of official Government sources, those official sources are not consulted as consistently as the media or as intensively as the internet, despite being consistently regarded as much more accurate, credible, and appropriate to LA needs. We interpret this apparent contradiction between LA officer confidence in official sources and their relatively infrequent use as a consequence, first, of technical-cognitive and practical-temporal difficulties accessing and understanding official sources of climate change information and, second, of concerns about the practical relevance of that information for the administrative functions of local government and thus for any meaningful response by LAs to climate change. Our survey recorded considerable levels of stress, cynicism, and futility among LA officials that not only complicate communication efforts but also call into question the central assumption of the UK Climate Change Programme that simply making more locally specific information about climate change impacts available will motivate appropriate action. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Bioenergy, the energy from biomass, has been used for thousands of years, ever since people started burning wood to cook food, and today wood is still our largest biomass resource for bioenergy. The use of bioenergy has the potential to greatly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. Replacing fossil fuels with energy from biomass has several distinct environmental implications. If biomass is harvested at a rate that is sustainable, using it for energy purposes does not result in any net increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas. States have played a leading role in protecting the environment by reducing emissions of greenhouse gasses (GHGs), and state emissions are significant on a global scale. CO 2 and CO are the main greenhouse gases associated with global warning. At the present time, coal is responsible for 30-40% of world CO 2 emissions from fossil fuels. SO2 and NOx contribute to acid rain. Carbon assessments can play an important role in a strategy to control carbon dioxide emissions while raising revenue.","Bioenergy; Biomass; Biomass technology; Environment; Global warning","Acid rain; Agriculture; Carbon dioxide; Coal combustion; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Plants (botany); Sulfur dioxide; Wind power; Wood; Bioenergy; Biomass technology; Biomass",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242287851

In order to obtain useful gasoline-range hydrocarbons from the pyrolytic oil, fractional distillation is preferred for product separation. More valuable chemical raw materials including benzene, toluene and other condensed aromatic hydrocarbons may be obtained by refining the pyrolytic oil.

The economies of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia are rapidly growing therefore forecast of emissions related with this occurrence becomes very important. The Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant (INPP), one of the largest in the world, is situated in the region. Two power production scenarios are modelled to investigate changes in power sector's emissions expected as the consequences of the coming closure of Ignalina NPP. Power market was assumed to be common for all three Baltic countries and was modelled by applying the Balmorel model. The planned closure of Ignalina NPP will bring restructuring of Lithuania power production sector and will change also power transmission between countries. Predictive identified the potential of investments for new modern power generation technologies. At the same time, modelling results show in both scenarios that CO2 and SO2 emissions from power production in the Baltic region will increase. The increment of emissions is discussed in the context of meeting requirements of UNFCCC Kyoto protocol and EC Directives. Despite of CO2 emissions increase the Kyoto protocol's requirements may be expected. At the same time, SO2 formation in Lithuania power sector may exceed the limits of the EU Council Directive 2001/80/EB therefore the additional measures to control SO2 emissions have to be investigated. © 2004 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Baltic States; CO2; SO2","Investments; Nuclear power plants; Power generation; Power transmission; Sulfur dioxide; Energy infrastructure; Power production; Power sectors; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; sulfur dioxide; carbon dioxide; sulfur dioxide; carbon dioxide; electricity generation; emission control; Kyoto Protocol; prediction; sulfur dioxide; article; Baltic States; economic aspect; electric power plant; energy resource; environmental impact assessment; environmental planning; nuclear power plant; power supply; prediction; priority journal; technology; air pollutant; electric power plant; Europe; forecasting; organization and management; policy; theoretical model; Baltic States; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Air Pollutants; Baltic States; Carbon Dioxide; Energy-Generating Resources; Europe; Forecasting; Models, Theoretical; Power Plants; Public Policy; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344618494

In this paper, the carbon mitigation potential of a series of agricultural land-management practices that are relevant to Belgian agriculture is quantified. Reforestation of a part of the total agricultural area is also considered, and the sequestration potential is corrected for practices already in use before the 1990 baseline. Existing and future agro-environmental policies as well as regional policies aimed at reducing environmental side effects of spreading organic amendments were considered when calculating the areas for which sequestration measures could be applied. The results are brought together in a realistic scenario. The mean sequestration potential expressed in Gg C per year for Belgium is as follows: additional bio-energy crops (96.2), spreading farmyard manure formerly applied to grassland on arable land (84.4) woodland regeneration (31.7), adopting no-till farming on suitable soils over a period of 20 years (15.8), the use of cover crops following winter cereals (15.2, adopted over 20 years), improved management of farmed peat soils (13.4) and organic farming (2.2). These figures suggest that, by 2010, Belgium can only expect a reduction in CO2 emissions ranging from 0.47 to 0.90% of the 1990 greenhouse gas emissions by improving agricultural management. These measures should not however be neglected as they will have other positive effects on soil properties, and they could offer a solution to reduce emissions from the agricultural sector by 4.7-9.0% of the 1990 values. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

For each of these objectives, a great many legal and policy instruments are available. Of equal importance, however, some of these instruments are also capable of producing additional or ancillary benefits. These include, but are not limited to, creation of goods and services (e.g., energy conservation, energy efficiency, renewable energy) for which there are significant and growing domestic and international markets, technological innovation, job creation, financial savings to customers and businesses, and reduction in air pollutants other than greenhouse gases.

An additional threat is the uncertainty climate change brings, including negative interactions between gradual and abrupt changes. However, adaptive behaviour and new technology have not been factored into many climate models. If appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures were implemented now, hunger could be substantially reduced, regardless of climate change.

Government of India has taken several steps to restrict the production and consumption of CFCs. Refrigerant conservation through recovery, recycling (R&R) and reclamation is one way of reducing emissions and encouraging timely phase out of CFCs in developing countries. CFC recovery, recycling and reclamation have been mandated in many developed countries. However, this practice is yet to make an impact in India although it is practiced in MAC sector to some extent. India is planning for the final phase out of CFCs in the RAC service sector, in which R&R will be one of the components. A model has been developed to assess the economics of R&R for some typical parameters in developing counties like India. The model suggests that the enterprises recycling 1500kg/a will break even within 1 year for all scenarios. However, R&R may not be cost effective for small workshops and low volume refrigerant vendors until either the price of CFC goes up or the cost of R&R unit is subsidized. A nationwide survey on RAC service sector revealed that in India, there are very few enterprises handling more than 500kg/a. Therefore, there is a need to provide the RAC service sector with adequate and innovative financial incentives. This paper attempts to study the issues related to R&R for various sub-sectors of RAC in developing countries with an emphasis on cost effectiveness.

Its low catalytic activity and specificity for oxygen leads to photorespiration, severely limiting photosynthesis and crop productivity. Consequently, Rubisco is a primary target for genetic engineering. Separate localization of the genes in the nuclear and chloroplast genomes and a complex assembly process resulting in a very low catalytic activity of hybrid Rubisco enzymes have rendered several earlier attempts of Rubisco engineering unsuccessful. Here we demonstrate that the RbcS gene, when integrated at a transcriptionally active spacer region of the chloroplast genome, in a nuclear RbcS antisense line and expressed under the regulation of heterologous (gene 10) or native (psbA) UTRs, results in the assembly of a functional holoenzyme and normal plant growth under ambient CO2 conditions, fully short-circuiting nuclear control of gene regulation. There was ≈150-fold more RbcS transcript in chloroplast transgenic lines when compared with the nuclear RbcS antisense line, whereas the wild type has 7-fold more transcript. The small subunit protein levels in the gene 10/RbcS and psbA/RbcS plants were 60% and 106%, respectively, of the wild type. Photosynthesis of gene 10/RbcS plants was approximately double that of the antisense plants, whereas that of psbA/RbcS plants was restored almost completely to the wild-type rates. These results have opened an avenue for using chloroplast engineering for the evaluation of foreign Rubisco genes in planta that eventually can result in achieving efficient photosynthesis and increased crop productivity.",,"plant RNA; small subunit ribosomal RNA; article; chloroplast; chloroplast genetics; controlled study; crop production; gene control; gene expression regulation; gene structure; genetic transcription; genetic variability; genome; heterologous expression; nonhuman; nucleic acid probe; photosynthesis; plant genetics; priority journal; productivity; RNA translation; wild type; Carbon Dioxide; Cell Nucleus; Chloroplasts; Genetic Vectors; Photosynthesis; Plants, Genetically Modified; Protein Biosynthesis; Ribulose-Bisphosphate Carboxylase; Transgenes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942501588

Field logs, morphological details and analytical data such as petrographic, cathodoluminescence and geochemical characteristics are described along with a discussion on their implications. Sand dunes and sandy plains dating to < 20 ka have weakly developed calcretes. The better-developed calcrete horizons occur in piedmonts, interdunes or in areas that have sufficient groundwater. Deep sections in the region show phases of calcrete development in aeolian sand aggradation at ∼ 150, ∼ 100, ∼ 60 and 27-14 ka. The extensive sheetwash plains have mature calcretes and date to mid-Pleistocene. Our studies indicate that these calcretes represent a hybrid process, where carbonate enrichment of the originally calcareous host occurred due to periodically raised groundwaters, and its differentiation into nodules occurred under subaerial environment i.e., after recession of groundwater. Deep sections also show a stack of discrete calcretes that developed in individual aggradation episodes with hiatuses as indicated by ESR dating results. Nodules display a multiplicity of carbonate precipitation events and internal reorganization of calcitic groundmass. The process is accompanied by degradation and transformation of unstable minerals, particularly clays and with a neosynthesis of palygorskite. The ancient calcretes are dated from the beginning of the Quaternary to ∼ 600 ka and show more evolved morphologies marked by brecciation, dissolution, laminar growth on brecciated surfaces, pisolites and several generations of re-cementation. Mica/chlorite schists and such other rocks are particularly vulnerable to replacement by carbonate. In an extreme case, replacement of quartzose sandstone was observed also. The presence of stretches of alluvio-colluvial plains in an area presently devoid of drainage bespeaks of occasional high-energy fluvial regime, under a semi-arid climate. The mid-Pleistocene period saw a shift towards more arid climate and this facilitated sheetwash aggradation. Finally, during the late Pleistocene, aggradation of aeolian sands indicated a progressively drier climate. However, this does not find its reflection in stable isotope data. The amount of carbonate in the form of calcretes is substantial. The present studies indicate that aeolian dust or rainwater are minor contributors to the carbonate budget. A more important source was provided by the pre-existing calcretes in the sheetwash aggraded plains and detrital carbonate in the aeolian sediments.

Before implantation, no activation of the auditory cortex has been observed after acoustic stimulation. Following auditory brainstem implant, the stimulation of 11 electrodes showed an activation value, in terms of blood flow increase, of the contralateral temporal cortex similar to that obtained with 6 electrodes (47.70 vs. 43.76%), but a significantly stronger activation was present in the contralateral parietal region (29.59 vs. 14.73%), in the homolateral temporal area (22.02 vs. 10.46%) and, especially, in the homolateral parietal zone (16.6 vs. 4.33%). The strongest activation in the contralateral temporal cortex was detected in the sagittal tomogram at 26.25 mm from the midline, that is in the areas where high frequencies are projected, both with 6 and 11 active electrodes. The medio-lateral auditory cortex, where the middle and lower frequencies are projected, showed an overall lower activation which was however significantly lower with 6-electrode stimulation. Stimulation of the surface of cochlear nuclei determines mainly an activation of the high frequency domain, independently of the electrodes number. This finding may explain the better results of cochlear implants in comparison with auditory brainstem implant and could justify the use of needle electrodes in auditory brainstem implant. In conclusion, Single Photon Emission Tomography can be considered useful in evaluating auditory brainstem implant placement and function. It is also able to define the effectiveness of acoustic stimulation, the degree and tonotopic spatial distribution of auditory cortex activation.",,"adult; article; auditory cortex; auditory stimulation; brain stem; case report; electrophysiology; evoked brain stem auditory response; hearing impairment; human; implantation; instrumentation; male; neurofibromatosis; parietal lobe; physiology; single photon emission computer tomography; vascularization; Acoustic Stimulation; Adult; Auditory Cortex; Brain Stem; Deafness; Electrophysiology; Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem; Humans; Male; Neurofibromatosis 2; Parietal Lobe; Prosthesis Implantation; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21944449647

The ATS Program, co-funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Fossil Energy, was a very successful multiyear (from 1992 to 2001) collaborative effort between government, industry, and participating universities. The program goals were to develop technologies necessary for achieving significant gains in natural gas-fired power generation plant efficiency, a reduction in emissions, and a decrease in cost of electricity, while maintaining current state-of-the-art electricity generation systems' reliability, availability, and maintainability levels. Siemens Westinghouse technology development concentrated on the following areas: aerodynamic design, combustion, heat transfer/cooling design, engine mechanical design, advanced alloys, advanced coating systems, and single crystal (SC) alloy casting development. Success was achieved in designing and full scale verification testing of a high-pressure high-efficiency compressor, airfoil clocking concept verification on a two-stage turbine rig test, high-temperature bond coat/TBC system development, and demonstrating feasibility of large SC turbine airfoil castings. The ATS program included successful completion of W501G engine development testing. This engine is the first step in the W501ATS engine introduction and incorporates many ATS technologies, such as closed-loop steam cooling, advanced compressor design, advanced sealing, and high-temperature materials and coatings.",,"Aerodynamic systems; Closed-loop steam cooling; Fossil energy; Plant efficiency; Airfoils; Coating techniques; Compressors; Cooling; Electric power generation; Engines; Natural gas; Particulate emissions; Turbines; design; gas turbine; industrial application; power generation; turbomachinery",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13644250789

It is also known for its leukotriene B4 12-hydroxydehydrogenase activity. In order to begin to understand these dual catalytic activities and validate its classification as a reductase of the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase family, an investigation of the mechanism of its NADPH-dependent activity was undertaken. Recombinant AOR and a 3-nonen-2-one substrate were used to perform steady-state initial velocity, product inhibition, and dead end inhibition experiments, which elucidated an ordered Theorell-Chance kinetic mechanism with NADPH binding first and NADP+ leaving last. A nearly 20-fold preference for NADPH over NADH was also observed. The dependence of kinetic parameters V and V/K on pH suggests the involvement of a general acid with a pK of 9.2. NADPH isomers stereospecifically labeled with deuterium at the 4-position were used to determine that AOR catalyzes the transfer of the pro-R hydride to the β-carbon of an α,β -unsaturated ketone, illudin M. Two-dimensional nuclear Overhauser effect NMR spectra demonstrate that this atom becomes the R-hydrogen at this position on the metabolite. Using [4R-2H]NADPH, small primary kinetic isotope effects of 1.16 and 1.73 for V and V/K, respectively, were observed and suggest that hydride transfer is not rate-limiting. Atomic absorption spectroscopy indicated an absence of Zn2+ from active preparations of AOR. Thus, AOR fits predictions made for medium-chain reductases and bears similar characteristics to well known medium-chain alcohol dehydrogenases.",,"Aldehydes; Catalysis; Isotopes; Ketones; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Parameter estimation; Substrates; Antioxidative enzymes; Kinetic parameters; Enzymes; 3 nonen 2 one; alcohol dehydrogenase; aldehyde; alkenal oxidoreductase; alkenalone oxidoreductase; carbon; deuterium; illudin M; ketone; leukotriene B4; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; oxidoreductase; recombinant enzyme; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; unclassified drug; zinc ion; article; atomic absorption spectrometry; catalysis; enzyme binding; enzyme kinetics; nonhuman; nuclear Overhauser effect; pH; priority journal; steady state; stereospecificity; Alcohol Dehydrogenase; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Animals; Antioxidants; Carbon; Catalysis; Deuterium; Hydrogen; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ketones; Kinetics; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Models, Chemical; NADH, NADPH Oxidoreductases; NADP; Oxygen; Phylogeny; Progesterone; Protein Binding; Rats; Recombinant Proteins; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Spectrophotometry, Atomic; Stereoisomerism; Tryptophan; Zinc",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342434853

Their permeation properties were measured in an air/argon pO2 gradient as a function of temperature. At 900°C, the oxygen flux through a 1.26-mm-thick membrane was 0.075 μmol/cm 2·s and through a 0.25-mm-thick tube, 0.24 μmol/cm 2·s. For the POX measurements, a catalyst was added to the membrane and methane was introduced on the argon side. This resulted in a gradual increase of the oxygen flux with increasing concentration of methane, reaching 2 μmol/cm2·s at 900°C with pure methane. For the planar reactor, the CO selectivity reached 99% and the CH4 conversion 75% at 918°C with pure methane. For the tubular reactor, the CO selectivity and CH4 conversion were 83 and 99%, respectively, under the same conditions.

We studied the long-term (5- to 9-yr) growth response of two alpine forbs, Pedicularis recutita and Cirsium spinosissimum, to the environmental conditions in the center and at the periphery of a snowbank in the Swiss Alps. For that we analyzed the growth increments (annual rings) in the roots or rhizomes of the plants. While for both species there were no considerable size differences (number of shoots) between individuals growing in the center of the snowbank and those at the periphery, the growth patterns differed depending on species, temporal variations in growth conditions, and growth position. There were synchronous fluctuations in the width of the annual growth increments that were more pronounced in C. spinosissimum than in P. recutita and were restricted to plants growing in the center of the snowbank. These were apparently related to interannual variations in climatic conditions. In addition, C. spinosissimum plants growing at the periphery of the snowbank showed initially wide but strongly declining growth increments whereas plants growing in the center of the snowbank showed initially narrower but relatively stable growth increments. These patterns were only weakly reflected in P. recutita. Our results suggest that effects of climatic fluctuations on plant growth can be amplified in snowbanks and that there may be favorable growth conditions initially at the periphery of the snowbank that are compensated for in the center of the snowbank, in the long run, by continuously low-competition growth conditions. © 2004 Regents of the University of Colorado.",,"growth rate; plant community; Alps; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; World; Cirsium spinosissimum; Pedicularis recutita",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15044365516

Of current interest is the response of regional scale climate to global-scale changes in climate forcing, a problem made particularly difficult in regions of topographic complexity. In an effort to understand the role that regional-scale climate processes play in shaping the response of regional climate to changes in external forcing, the sensitivity of a high-resolution regional climate model (RCM) to mid-Holocene orbital forcing was tested, focusing on the Pacific coast region of the western United States as a case study. Mid-Holocene orbital forcing resulted in RCM-simulated summer warming of 1°-2.5°C over most of the western United States. This result is in strong agreement with proxy reconstructions, suggesting that regional mid-Holocene temperature change can be explained by direct orbital forcing alone, independent of climate system feedbacks. In contrast, positive anomalies (mid-Holocene-control) in mean annual precipitation - evaporation (P - E), dominated by changes in atmospheric circulation in the seasonal transition months of March and November, were in disagreement with proxy reconstructions from the Pacific coast. This model-data mismatch in moisture characteristics suggests that direct orbital forcing of regional-scale atmospheric processes was not the sole influence shaping the mid-Holocene moisture record of the Pacific coast. It also indicates that consideration of regional-scale climate system feedbacks and extraregional process interactions is critical for the application of RCMs to both paleoclimate problems and future climate change scenarios. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Climate systems; Orbital forcing; Regional-scale changes; Computer simulation; Evaporation; Geologic models; Precipitation (meteorology); Problem solving; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; evaporation; Holocene; orbital forcing; paleoclimate; precipitation (climatology); North America; Pacific Coast [United States]; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344586764

Since older vehicles generally pollute more than newer vehicles, public agencies adopt such programs to reduce air pollutant emissions. Current methods of estimating the emissions reduction benefits of the programs are based on several assumptions and limited empirical evidence. This paper uses data from two large-scale programs in California to demonstrate that changing assumptions can significantly alter the assumed benefits of the program. The results show that vehicle retirement programs are likely to reduce emissions, but probably not as much as expected, particularly for nitrogen oxide and carbon monoxide emissions. The differences in estimates stem from several factors: scrapped vehicles are generally driven fewer miles than other vehicles of the same model year; some of the vehicles would have been scrapped without the program or not have lasted as long as expected; emissions for some pollutants may not be as high as predicted; and replacement vehicles are usually older than the fleet average. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The search was initiated with a total of 218 structures, and in few cases, geometrical and stereoisomers were considered. The exhaustive study on all these topological structures resulted in a total of 263 stationary points on the C 6H 6 potential energy surface. The B3LYP level characterizes 209 as minima, 31 as transition states, 8 as second-order, 7 as third-order, and 1 as fourth-order saddle points. The remaining 7 structures could be located as stationary points only at the MP2 level. The molecules were classified into acyclic, monocyclic, bicyclic, tricyclic, and tetracyclic. The acyclic isomers fall within a range of 60-80 kcal/mol higher in energy compared to benzene. Among the cyclic structures, the range of relative stabilities of minima is larger, viz., monocyclic (31-146 kcal/mol), bicyclic (72-159 kcal/mol), tricyclic (72-300 kcal/mol), and tetracyclic (102-156 kcal/mol).

Samples were analyzed for major element concentrations, specific conductance and pH. Samples from five of the sites were analyzed for trace element concentrations. Pb, Cd, SO 42- and non-sea salt SO42- concentrations were significantly higher in layers deposited later in the winter than those deposited earlier. This is consistent with the seasonal increase in atmospheric aerosol loading (arctic haze) that develops as the Arctic polar front expands southward in March and April. Haze contaminant concentrations in the snow pack were as high south of the Brooks Range as they were to the north, suggesting the Brooks Range is not an effective orographic barrier to aerosol transport. Computed yearly non-sea salt SO4 2- loading rates at the 16 sites ranged from 12 to 281mg/m 2/yr. Elevated concentrations of Hg, Na and Cl were measured near the Arctic Ocean coast but not near the Bering Sea coast. To explain this pattern we suggest that the ""effective distance from the coast,"" inferred from prevailing wind directions and storm tracks, is critical in governing whether halogen emissions from the ocean are available for photochemical reactions that result in Hg deposition to the snow.","Aerosols; Arctic; Snow chemistry; Trace elements","Aerosols; Deposition; Mercury (metal); pH effects; Photochemical reactions; Snow; Storms; Wind; Specific conductance; Environmental engineering; cadmium; chloride; halogen; lead; mercury; snow; sodium; sulfate; trace element; aerosol; chemical composition; haze; mercury (element); snow; trace element; aerosol; Arctic; article; conductance; haze; mathematical computing; pH; photochemistry; priority journal; sea; United States; water pollution; water sampling; wind; winter; Alaska; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347985681

Single species responses to pesticide exposure are well documented; however, little is known about community level responses to pesticides, especially at lower trophic levels. Microbial assemblages at two sites along the C-111 canal in the Dade County agricultural area in October 1999 (wet season, limited pesticide application) and in February 2000 (dry season, heavy pesticide application) were colonized onto artificial substrates, transported to the laboratory and exposed to atrazine (20 and 200 μg/l), chlorothalonil (2 and 20 μg/l), or endosulfan (1 and 10 μg/l). Structural and functional responses were measured at 24 h and 168 h post-dose. Regardless of site, season or exposure time, the highest atrazine dose (200 μg/l) significantly reduced chlorophyll a, phototrophic carbon assimilation and bacterial biomass, but stimulated heterotrophic bacterial productivity. Chlorophyll a was also significantly reduced by 20 μ/l atrazine (October only). The lowest endosulfan dose (1 μg/l) significantly increased phototrophic carbon assimilation. The highest chlorothalonil dose (20 μg/l) stimulated heterotrophic bacterial productivity (October only). An overall decrease in the number of protist taxa was observed with all pesticide treatments. Atrazine significantly decreased the relative abundance of chlorophytes and chrysophytes and increased the number of diatom and heterotrophic protist taxa. Chlorothalonil significantly increased the relative abundance of diatoms and chlorophytes, while chrysophytes and heterotrophic protists decreased. Endosulfan also significantly reduced diatom abundance, as well as decreasing the number of chrysophyte, cryptophyte and dinoflagellate taxa. Although previous agricultural pesticide exposure was greater at site C than at site E, the microbial assemblages at site C did not exhibit increased resistance to a subsequent dose of the pesticides.","Atrazine; Chlorothalonil; Endosulfan; Microbial assemblage; South Florida","atrazine; chlorothalonil; endosulfan; pesticide; atrazine; endosulfan; microbial community; pesticide; pollution effect; wetland; article; bacterial metabolism; concentration response; controlled study; diatom; microflora; nonhuman; phototropism; priority journal; season; seasonal variation; statistical significance; United States; Agriculture; Atrazine; Bacteria; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Endosulfan; Environmental Monitoring; Florida; Humans; Nitriles; Pesticides; Seasons; Water Microbiology; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Everglades; Florida; North America; United States; Bacillariophyta; Bacteria (microorganisms); Chlorophyta; Chrysophyceae; Cryptophyta; Dinophyceae; Protista",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543004713

This study provides a first look at saguaro regeneration in 30 Arizona populations, and decouples summer rainfall from temperature, despite the strong relationship between these two variables, to determine the effects of each. Partial correlations quantify the success of temperature and precipitation in predicting high juvenile survival. This study finds that, once saguaros receive enough summer moisture (i.e. a population exists), highest maximum July temperature is the variable that best predicts recruitment. Although ultimately limited by water, saguaro regeneration appears to be influenced by maximum summer temperatures more than precipitation. The population structure for all populations shows a large spike among the youngest individuals, suggesting that recruitment continues in populations of this protected species. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

An integrated approach was followed concentrating on enhancement of food security and preservation of environmental quality. Climate change projections were extracted from the Hadley Climate Center (HadCM3) coupled global circulation model (GCM). Impact and adaptation strategies were evaluated with a coupled modeling framework based on the soil-water-atmosphere-plant (SWAP) field scale model and the water and salinity basin model (WSBM) basin scale model. Three time periods were considered where the 1961-1990 period was used to adjust climate change projections to local conditions and to provide a reference to compare expected changes in the near future (2010-2039) and distant future (2070-2099). The overall impact of climate change on food security and environmental quality appears to be positive as a result of enhanced crop growth due to higher CO2 levels and a small increase in precipitation. However, extremes will be more profound in the future, making adaptation strategies necessary. Results from the modeling framework have been presented in a format accessible to water resources managers and policy makers to enable them to make sound decisions on the required adaptation strategies. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

These organisms, members of the class Alphaproteobacteria, primarily use CO2 as an electron sink to achieve redox homeostasis. After noting the consequences of inactivating the capacity for CO2 reduction through the Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) pathway, it was shown that the molecular control of many additional important biological processes catalyzed by nonsulfur purple bacteria is linked to expression of the CBB genes. Several regulator proteins are involved, with the two component Reg/Prr regulatory system playing a major role in maintaining redox poise in these organisms. Reg/Prr was shown to be a global regulator involved in the coordinate control of a number of metabolic processes including CO2 assimilation, nitrogen fixation, hydrogen metabolism and energy-generation pathways. Accumulating evidence suggests that the Reg/Prr system senses the oxidation/reduction state of the cell by monitoring a signal associated with electron transport. The response regulator RegA/PrrA activates or represses gene expression through direct interaction with target gene promoters where it often works in concert with other regulators that can be either global or specific. For the key CO2 reduction pathway, which clearly triggers whether other redox balancing mechanisms are employed, the ability to activate or inactivate the specific regulator CbbR is of paramount importance. From these studies, it is apparent that a detailed understanding of how diverse regulatory elements integrate and control metabolism will eventually be achieved. © 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

It contains the nickel porphinoid F430, a prosthetic group that has been proposed to be directly involved in the catalytic cycle by the direct binding and subsequent reduction of the substrate methyl-coenzyme M. The active enzyme (MCRred1) can be generated in vivo and in vitro by reduction from MCRox1, which is an inactive form of the enzyme. Both the MCRred1 and MCRox1 forms have been proposed to contain F430 in the Ni(I) oxidation state on the basis of EPR and ENDOR data. In order to further address the oxidation state of the Ni center in F430, variable-temperature, variable-field magnetic circular dichroism (VTVH MCD), coupled with parallel absorption and EPR studies, have been used to compare the electronic and magnetic properties of MCRred1, MCRox1, and various EPR silent forms of MCR, with those of the isolated penta-methylated cofactor (F 430M) in the + 1, +2 and +3 oxidation states. The results confirm Ni(I) assignments for MCRred1 and MCRred2 forms of MCR and reveal charge transfer transitions involving the Ni d orbitals and the macrocycle π orbitals that are unique to Ni(I) forms of F430. Ligand field transitions associated with S = 1 Ni(II) centers are assigned in the near-IR MCD spectra of MCRox1-silent and MCR-silent, and the splitting in the lowest energy d-d transition is shown to correlate qualitatively with assessments of the zero-field splitting parameters determined by analysis of VTVH MCD saturation magnetization data. The MCD studies also support rationalization of MCRox1 as a tetragonally compressed Ni(III) center with an axial thiolate ligand or a coupled Ni(II)-thiyl radical species, with the reality probably lying between these two extremes. The reinterpretation of MCRox1 as a formal Ni(III) species rather than an Ni(I) species obviates the need to invoke a two-electron reduction of the F430 macrocyclic ligand on reductive activation of MCRox1 to yield MCRred1.","Factor 430; Magnetic circular dichroism spectroscopy; Methanogenic archaea; Methyl-coenzyme M reductase; Nickel enzymes","coenzyme f430; ester derivative; methyl coenzyme m reductase; nickel; oxidoreductase; unclassified drug; article; catalysis; circular dichroism; electron nuclear double resonance; electron spin resonance; enzyme mechanism; enzyme substrate complex; Methanobacterium; near infrared spectroscopy; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; oxidation reduction state; priority journal; Archaea; Methanobacterium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3943085693

The protocol emerged first as a framework agreement, but through international negotiations it is progressing into sets of legal articles. These impose obligations on all signatories, but they also identify opportunities for improved environmental land management at local, national and international levels. This is particularly true for soil conservation, where the sequestration of carbon above and below ground increases soil organic matter, enhances soil fertility, and improves production, while concomitantly reducing atmospheric CO2. It is a classic 'win-win' situation.

Alberta is singularly well endowed with suitable salt deposits. Of these, the Lotsberg Salt of east central Alberta is the best of the three major salt-bearing zones, and is geographically close to present and future sources of CO2 associated with fossil fuel development projects in Alberta. The characteristics of the Lotsberg Salt and overlying strata are presented in the context of the long-term future of stored CO2. There are a number of features that indicate a high level of security against leakage and migration of gas back to the biosphere. A procedure for the creation, testing, and filling of a salt cavern is presented. A critical requirement was to achieve a reasonable long-term prediction of the behaviour of the cavern during slow closure, while taking into account the pressure and volume behaviour of the gas within the cavern. This was achieved with a semi-analytical model that predicts long-term pressures and volume changes. There appear to be no technical obstacles or undue risks identified that would militate against the use of salt caverns for permanent CO2 sequestration. It is an option that can be seriously considered in Alberta, or in other geographical locations where the geological conditions are suitable.",,"Coal-fired power plants; Salt caverns; Salt solution; Sequestration; Aquifers; Biodegradation; Equations of state; Fluidized beds; Gas emissions; Gas fuel storage; Greenhouse effect; Growth kinetics; Land fill; Leakage (fluid); Mathematical models; Methane; Oil fields; Risk assessment; Statistical methods; Carbon dioxide",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144341874

M5S 1AS, Canada","Measurements from the Terra satellite launched in December of 1999 provide a global record of the recent interannual variability of tropospheric air quality: carbon monoxide (CO) from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument and aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). This paper compares and contrasts these data sets with a view to understanding the general features of the overall pollutant loading of the Northern Hemisphere (NH). We present a detailed examination of the seasonal and recent interannual variability of the fine mode AOD and CO column, first considering the variation of the global zonal average for both quantities, and then concentrating on several geographical regions with the aim of isolating different emissions. In a zonal sense, the principal NH sources are related to anthropogenic urban and industrial activity. We show that both the CO and the AOD zonal seasonal variations reflect the atmospheric oxidant concentration, which determines the primary sink of CO and the production of sulfate aerosol. As a consequence, the seasonal cycles are several months out of phase, with perturbations resulting from sporadic wildfire or biomass-burning emissions. In these cases, carbonaceous particles dominate the AOD, and this results in the best correlation with the CO column. Of the 4 years of data available from the Terra satellite, the winter and spring of 2002-2003 showed anomalously high NH pollution compared to the previous years. This was a result of fires in western Russia in the late summer and fall of 2002 and intense fires in the southeast of Russia in the spring and summer of 2003. We examine these events using fire counts from MODIS to indicate the burning regions and investigate how the timing of the fires in relation to atmospheric oxidant concentrations affects the resultant seasonal pollutant loadings. Finally, we trace the emissions from these fires to indicate how intense local pollution sources can impact continental- and global-scale air quality.

They modify soil physical properties, soil organic matter decomposition, and thus regulate carbon and nitrogen cycling in soil. However, their interactions with soil microorganisms are still poorly understood, in particular the effect of gut passage on the community structure of ingested microorganisms. Moreover, it is still unsolved, if earthworms, like many other soil-feeding invertebrates, possess an indigenous gut microbial community. Therefore, we investigated the bacterial and archaeal community structure in soil (with and without additional beech litter), gut, and fresh casts of Lumbricus terrestris, an anecic litter-feeding earthworm, by means of terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analysis of 16S rRNA gene fragments. Ecological indices of community diversity and similarity, calculated from the T-RFLP profiles, revealed only small differences between the bacterial and archaeal communities in soil, gut, and fresh casts under both feeding conditions, especially in comparison to other soil-feeding invertebrates. However, multivariate statistical analysis combining multidimensional scaling and discriminant function analysis proved that these differences were highly significant, in particular when the earthworms were fed beech litter in addition. Because there were no dominant gut-specific OTUs detectable, the existence of an abundant indigenous earthworm microbial community appears unlikely, at least in the midgut region of L. terrestris. © 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

The highest reaction rate was obtained at the Rh loading of 0.5-1.0 wt %. The Rh/TiO2 catalyst was gradually deactivated in prolonged benzene photooxidation, due to the increasing amount of carbonaceous materials on the catalyst surface.

Copper-Carbon composites are an example for this material class. They have a potential for an application as heat sinks in electronic components, but joining the two materials is difficult. Two critical processing steps determine the interfacial properties: first the deposition of Cu on the C surface at room temperature and second the heat treatment of the material during the compaction process. In this paper, we investigate the adhesive properties of Cu-films on planar C-substrates and the de-wetting of Cu from C during heat treatment. De-wetting occurs well below the melting point of copper. It starts with hole formation and ends with the decomposition of the Cu-Film into isolated droplets. A similar behavior is observed on Carbon-fibers. The above issues (interfacial adhesion and de-wetting) are investigated in dependence on several pre-treatment processes, which were applied to the C-surface such as plasma-modification or the deposition of intermediate layers. The basic mechanisms of adhesion promotion and de-wetting are identified and the consequences of the experimental findings for the manufacturing of Cu-C composite materials are briefly discussed. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, the COPERT III model (version 2.1) was evaluated by utilizing a dataset available from on-road optical remote sensing emission measurements on a large number of vehicles at three different sites in Gothenburg, Sweden, in 2001 and 2002. The remote sensing dataset contained fuel-specific emissions (grams of pollutant emitted per liter of fuel burnt) of carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxide (NO) and hydrocarbons (HC) as well as speed and acceleration data for individual vehicles. For gasoline passenger cars, a total of approximately 20 000 records with valid CO and HC remote sensor readings, and 16 000 records with valid NO readings were available for the COPERT III evaluation. For diesel passenger cars and heavy-duty vehicles the remote sensing dataset contained 1100 and 650 records with valid NO readings, respectively. Average fuel-specific emission factors derived from the remote sensing measurements were compared with corresponding emission factors derived from COPERT III calculations for urban, hot stabilized conditions and average speed around 45 km h -1. The results show a good agreement between the two methods for gasoline passenger cars' NO x emissions for all COPERT III subsectors (i.e. cylinder volume classes) and technology classes (e.g. EURO 1, 2, 3). In the case of CO emissions, the agreement was less favorable, with the model overpredicting emissions for all but one of the technology classes. For gasoline passenger cars' HC emissions the model-to-measurement agreement was reasonably good, although with a tendency for the model to overpredict the emissions. There was also a relatively good agreement for NO x emission factors for diesel passenger cars. Finally, NO x emission factors for heavy-duty vehicles according to the COPERT III model were systematically lower than those from the remote sensing measurements, and in particular the reduction between EURO 2 and EURO 3 tended to be overestimated by the model. The study has demonstrated the potential and usefulness of on-road optical remote sensing for emission model evaluation purposes. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Owing to the commercial character, and therefore, the confidentiality restrictions imposed by plant builders and many of the operators, much of the information collected has either to be presented in a generalized manner, and in any case anonymously. The survey was focused on four major issues: process control strategy, process control systems, monitors used for process control and finally the correlation between the 850°C/2 s rule in the European waste incineration directive and integrated process control. The process control strategies range from reaching good and stable emissions at the stack to stabilizing and maximizing the energy output from the process. The main indicator to be monitored, in cases in which the focus is controlling emissions, is the oxygen content in the stack. Keeping the oxygen concentration in a determined range (usually between 8 and 12 vol.%) ensures stable and tolerated concentrations of the gaseous emissions. In the case for which stabilization of energy production is the principal aim, the main controlled parameter is the steam temperature and flow-rate, which is usually related to the fuel energetic input. A lot of other parameters are used as alarm criteria, the most common of which is the carbon monoxide concentration. The process control systems used most commonly feature partially automated classical proportional integral derivative (PID) controllers. New and innovative process control systems, such as fuzzy-logic control systems, are still unknown to most plant managers while their performance is reported to be unsatisfactory in plants in which such systems have been tested or are in use. Monitoring components used in process control are still based on classical tools such as thermocouples. The use of modern and more reliable sensors is very limited due to the high initial investment cost or simply the fear of using non-standard technologies. Complying with the 850°C/2 s rule in the European waste incineration directive generally is seen to be a handicap for the process control, either in terms of cost, or flexibility of reaction, or both, particularly in old incineration facilities where such restrictions were not planned in the design.

There are currently no regional criteria used to define the temporal aspect of the annual monsoon season in the southwestern USA, and only a single local definition. A regionalized definition of the annual timing of the monsoon season would seem to be a greater representation of the synoptic-scale effects of the monsoon rather than individual definitions at point locations across the region. The research presented here outlines a method for defining the annual onset and demise of the regional monsoon season of the southwestern USA, and assesses the results through comparisons with a method currently used at one location within the region and with atmospheric composites from historic data. Using hourly dew-point temperature data at five surface stations and daily precipitation data for 193 stations across the southwestern USA for June through to October for a 52 year period, daily humidity and precipitation threshold values indicative of monsoon moisture are established. The first and last occurrences of both humidity and precipitation sustained for a synoptic period of 3 days mark the annual onset and demise of the monsoon season, whereas all days in between that meet the humidity and precipitation thresholds are categorized as 'monsoon days'. Results show good agreement with sample historic data for the sole local definition within the region, and atmospheric composites indicate a likelihood of accurate representation of monsoon onset and demise across the region. The significance of accurate onset and demise dates is apparent in the intimate relationship between seasonal precipitation across the region and the length of the monsoon season. Based upon the procedure, a historic monsoon season database was constructed for the southwestern USA for use in climatological, meteorological, and case-study analyses. © 2004 Royal Meteorological Society.","Humidity; North American monsoon; Precipitation; Regional definition","Atmospheric humidity; Atmospheric turbulence; Climate change; Data reduction; Moisture; Precipitation (meteorology); Monsoons; Precipitation thresholds; Climatology; annual cycle; humidity; monsoon; precipitation (climatology); North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1342331796

They potentially have a significant economic and societal relevance because of their effects on biota in one of the largest marine coastal upwelling regions. Until recently they were considered to be of local geographical extent and forced by processes in the water column. Here, we report on ship-borne acoustic surveys and core evidence that suggest a significant contribution by eruptions of biogenic gas accumulations in unconsolidated organic-rich diatomaceous oozes on the shelf. Approximately 8% of the mud area (1360km2) hosts free gas just decimeters to meters below the sediment-water interface. The gas is a mixture of methane and H2S. A portion of the H2S is produced by the reduction of sulfate with methane in the sulfate-methane transition zone, where it reaches pore water concentrations up to 18mmol/l. The gas is contained in very porous, low density and liquid sediments and is in some cases capped by a denser layer within the sediment. Possible candidates to trigger eruptions are changes in the atmospheric and oceanographic pressure fields, shoaling of the methane-sulfate transition zone caused by decreasing rates of methane oxidation, and precipitation-induced pressure signals from the inland catchment transmitted to the base of the diatomaceous ooze via fossil river beds. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Some air emissions from, animal feeding operations (AFOS) affect neighbors, and other emissions have national and even global impacts. Because agricultural operations have been considered minor sources of air pollutants, emissions from most AFOs have escaped regulation under the federal CAA and its state implementation programs. State regulation of AFOs often focuses on water quality, with incidental provisions for air quality. Even states with measures for specific substances (odor, hydrogen sulfide) emitted by AFOs lack comprehensive regulatory systems. The seven states surveyed in this article have enacted a number of measures to govern air emissions from livestock facilities. When research, encouraged by the US EPA, has developed accurate methods for measuring air emissions, AFOs can expect federal regulation under the CAA, followed by state implementation. In developing that regulation, the EPA may be advised to consider effective elements in state regulatory programs.",,"agricultural emission; atmospheric pollution; livestock farming; pollution control; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12844266856

The objective of the mission is to provide exploratory global measurements of the earth's soil moisture at 10-km resolution with two- to three-days revisit and land-surface freeze/thaw conditions at 3-km resolution with one- to two-days revisit. The mission builds on the heritage of ground-based and airborne passive and active low-frequency microwave measurements that have demonstrated and validated the effectiveness of the measurements and associated algorithms for estimating the amount and phase (frozen or thawed) of surface soil moisture. The mission data will enable advances in weather and climate prediction and in mapping processes that link the water, energy, and carbon cycles. The Hydros instrument is a combined radar and radiometer system operating at 1.26 GHz (with VV, HH, and HV polarizations) and 1.41 GHz (with H, V, and U polarizations), respectively. The radar and the radiometer share the aperture of a 6-m antenna with a look-angle of 39° with respect to nadir. The lightweight deployable mesh antenna is rotated at 14.6 rpm to provide a constant look-angle scan across a swath width of 1000 km. The wide swath provides global coverage that meet the revisit requirements. The radiometer measurements allow retrieval of soil moisture in diverse (nonforested) landscapes with a resolution of 40 km. The radar measurements allow the retrieval of soil moisture at relatively high resolution (3 km). The mission includes combined radar/radiometer data products that will use the synergy of the two sensors to deliver enhanced-quality 10-km resolution soil moisture estimates. In this paper, the science requirements and their traceability to the instrument design are outlined. A review of the underlying measurement physics and key instrument performance parameters are also presented.","Land freeze/thaw; Microwave remote sensing; Satellites; Soil moisture","Earth (planet); Freezing; Microwaves; Moisture; Soils; Weather forecasting; Weather satellites; Land freeze/thaw; Microwave remote sensing; Soil moisture; Remote sensing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7044262193

We analyzed the spatial and interannual variability of plant functional type biomass from field studies in low arctic tussock tundra and compared these to climate change simulations of plant community composition using a dynamic tundra vegetation model (ArcVeg). Spatial heterogeneity of peak season live aboveground biomass was estimated using field samples taken from low arctic tundra at Ivotuk, Alaska (68.5°N, 155.7°W) in 1999. Coefficients of variation for live aboveground biomass at the 1 m2 scale ranged from 14.6% for deciduous shrubs, 18.5% for graminoids and 25.3% for mosses to over 57% for forbs and lichens. Spatial heterogeneity in the ArcVeg dynamic vegetation model was simulated to be greater than the field data, ranging from 37.1% for deciduous shrubs to 107.9% for forbs. Disturbances in the model, such as caribou grazing and freezing-thawing of soil, as well as demographic stochasticity, led to the greater variability in the simulated results. Temporal variances of aboveground live biomass over a 19-year period using data from Toolik Lake, AK fell within the range of field and simulation spatial variances. However, simulations using ArcVeg suggest that temporal variability can be substantially less than site-scale spatial variability. Field data coupled with rcVeg simulations of climate change scenarios indicate that some changes in plant community composition may be detectable within two decades following the onset of warming, and shrubs and mosses might be the key indicators of community change. Model simulations also project increasing landscape scale spatial heterogeneity (particularly of shrubs) with increasing temperatures. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Arctic tundra; Global warming; Plant community dynamics; Spatial and temporal heterogeneity; Vegetation dynamics model","arctic environment; climate change; global warming; plant community; spatiotemporal analysis; vegetation dynamics; Bryophyta; Rangifer tarandus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3943070991

In an attempt to assess the impact of the human domination of ecosystems, this study quantifies the effect of human activities on aboveground carbon stocks in vegetation, based on a comparison of potential and actual vegetation in Austria. Following an accounting approach, statistical and GIS data on vegetation, elevation, land use, biomass harvest, as well as forest inventories and real estate statistics, were entered into the assessment, which was performed at the level of municipalities (n = 2,350). The results show that aboveground carbon storage in Austria has been considerably reduced by human activities. Actual vegetation contains 64% less carbon than would be expected in potential vegetation. The conversion of forests to cropland, grasslands, and urban areas has contributed 77% to this reduction in carbon stocks, the remaining 23% is due to forest management. In Austria, aboveground carbon stocks in forests have been reduced by 30% due to reductions in stand age and changes in forest species composition. Placing the data in a historical context, this analysis suggests that the current terrestrial carbon sink is a reversal of past carbon losses.","Aboveground carbon stock; Environmental history; Human domination of ecosystems; Kyoto protocol; Standing crop; Terrestrial carbon sinks","carbon sink; environmental history; GIS; Kyoto Protocol; land use change; nature-society relations; vegetation cover",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243092494

The thrips infestation affects the qualitative and quantitative characters of mulberry leaf, by direct feeding damage to leaves and the ingestion of sap, which in turn affects the silkworm cocoon crop. This is most harmful in dry climates and seasons when heavily attacked plants lose moisture heavily. Under these conditions infestation can seriously deplete yields. The seasonal population fluctuation and the degree of damage caused to the host plant are influenced by various environmental factors including climate, host-plant variety, topography, soil type, and management regimes.

M5T 2S8, United States","Background: Dorzolamide hydrochloride is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor that reduces intraocular pressure (IOP) by decreasing the production of aqueous humour in the ciliary body. Theoretically, topical use of this agent has the potential to directly affect retinal vasculature through local induced acidosis. We performed a study to determine whether there are changes in retinal arteriole hemodynamics, as assessed with the Canon laser blood flowmeter, in healthy subjects following topical administration of dorzolamide. Methods: We recruited 17 healthy volunteers, nine men and eight women aged 25 to 55 years (mean 31.4 [standard deviation (SD) 9.88] years). The inclusion criteria were Snellen visual acuity of 20/30 or better, normal anterior eye examination, IOP of 21 mm Hg or less, and a normal fundus appearance. One eye of each subject was randomly assigned to receive a drop of 2% dorzolamide. The contralateral eye of 10 of the subjects received a placebo drop (artificial tears). Before and 1 hour after drop administration, we obtained blood flow measurements from an inferotemporal arteriole approximately 1 disc diameter from the optic nerve head rim using the Canon laser blood flowmeter, model 100. The IOP was measured by means of Goldmann applanation tonometry before and 1 hour after drop administration. Results: The mean IOP was significantly reduced in the dorzolamide-treated eyes, from 14.4 mm Hg (SD 2.94 mm Hg) to 11.7 mm Hg (SD 2.50 mm Hg) (p < 0.001). The IOP was also reduced in the placebo group (15.6 mm Hg [SD 3.41 mm Hg] vs. 14.6 mm Hg [SD 3.28 mm Hg]), but the difference was not significant. There was no significant difference in mean arteriole diameter, mean blood velocity or mean blood flow after drug administration in the dorzolamide-treated eyes. Interpretation: Our results indicate that a single topical application of dorzolamide in healthy subjects has no effect on retinal arteriole diameter, blood velocity or blood flow, as measured with the Canon laser blood flowmeter. Longer-term studies of retinal hemodynamics in patients with glaucoma are warranted as evolving treatments aim to improve ocular blood flow as well as reduce IOP.","Blood flow; Dorzolamide hydrochloride; Intraocular pressure","dorzolamide; placebo; adult; arteriole; article; blood flow velocity; blood flowmeter; blood vessel diameter; controlled study; drug efficacy; female; human; human experiment; intraocular pressure; laser flowmeter; male; normal human; retina blood flow",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444338270

Homozygous xan1/xan1 seedlings, in field conditions, die after depletion of cotyledonary reserves and can be only recovered by selfing normal heterozygous plants (XAN1/xan1). xan1 mutant showed aberrant development of chloroplasts, deficient pigment content and reduced CO2 assimilation rate. Also, xan1 mutation negatively affected endogenous ABA levels both in non-stressed and dehydrated leaves. Photodestruction of both chlorophyll a and β-carotene in xan1 leaves directly correlated with light intensity. The activation of the xanthophyll cycle under low light (165 PPFD) and the appreciable amounts of zeaxanthin and antheraxanthin retained by xan1 mutant after a 24 h dark period were clear signals of a strong photoinhibition state. The unusual patterns of thylakoid proteins composition detected in seedlings grown under 165 PPFD, by using both denaturing and native electrophoresis analyses, were also indicative of high sensitivity of the thylakoid polypeptide complexes to light stress. Moreover, immunoblot analysis of psbA gene product (D1 protein) indicated that even at 165 PPFD the structure of photosystem (PS) II reaction center was severely damaged. Interestingly, xan1 seedlings grown in dim light (3.5 PPFD) revealed a severely altered chloroplast ultrastructure, despite the lack of photooxidative effects on leaf pigments and the lack of alterations in the electrophoretic profiles of thylakoid proteins. Electron microscopy indicated that XAN1 product is required for normal organization and distribution of thylakoids in the stroma.

Beforehand, the anaesthetic protocol must be documented without muscle relaxation in the species studied. Documentation is difficult to obtain from the scientific literature. When focusing on cardiac function over time, in particular, the ideal anaesthetic protocol should cause no or minor alterations in cardiac variables. Methods: We intended to document an anaesthetic protocol involving ventilation with N2O combined with loading doses and continuous infusions of pentobarbital, fentanyl and midazolam in seven pigs by applying potentially painful stimuli every 15min for 7h. Subsequently, left ventricular global and regional function was studied with conductance catheter and strain rate imaging by echocardiography in eight pigs with pancuronium included. Results: Pigs without pancuronium were completely immobilized and unresponsive to potentially painful stimuli and sternotomy, with no accumulation or degradation of anaesthetic agents. With pancuronium included, left ventricular preload gradually decreased together with reduction of cardiac index from 3.52 ± 0.14 at 2 h to 2.84 ± 0.11 L min-1 m-2 (±SEM) after 7h of observation. Preload recruitable stroke work decreased after 7h, whereas peak systolic strain in the anterior left ventricular wall and load-independent indices of diastolic function were not significantly altered. Conclusion: In specific experimental protocols, the anaesthetic protocol described could allow the use of muscular paralysis in young domestic pigs, for instance when involving hypothermic cardiopulmonary bypass, cardioplegic arrest and reperfusion. © Acta Anaesthesiologica Scandinavica 48 (2004).","Anaesthesia; Cardiac function; Muscular paralysis; Swine","fentanyl; midazolam; nitrous oxide; pancuronium; pentobarbital; anesthesia level; animal model; aorta pressure; article; cardioplegia; cardiopulmonary bypass; clinical protocol; controlled study; diastole; echocardiography; heart function; heart hemodynamics; heart index; heart left ventricle; heart preload; heart rate; heart stroke volume; neuromuscular blocking; nonhuman; paralysis; priority journal; sternotomy; systole; Adjuvants, Anesthesia; Anesthesia; Anesthesia, Inhalation; Anesthetics, Intravenous; Animals; Cardioplegic Solutions; Cardiopulmonary Bypass; Fentanyl; Heart; Heart Arrest, Induced; Hemodynamic Processes; Hydrocortisone; Midazolam; Monitoring, Intraoperative; Myocardial Contraction; Myocardial Reperfusion; Neuromuscular Blockade; Nitrous Oxide; Pentobarbital; Research Design; Swine; Ventricular Function, Left",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644278736

Increased electricity generation in combination with the potential to use biomass (e.g. bark, hog fuel) more efficiently can result in increased power output compared to the conventional Tomlinson-boiler. Because the BLGCC enables an integrated pulp and paper mill to produce excess power, it can offset electricity produced by power plants. This may lead to reduction of the net-CO2 emissions. The impact of BLGCC to offset CO2 emissions from the pulp and paper industry is studied. We focus on two different plant designs and compare the situation in Sweden and the US. The CO 2 emissions are studied as function of the share of recycled fibre used to make the paper. The study shows that under specific conditions the production of ""CO2-free paper"" is possible. First, energy efficiency in pulp and paper mills needs to be improved to allow the export of sufficient power to offset emissions from fossil fuels used in boilers and other equipment. Secondly, the net-CO2 emission per ton of paper depends strongly on the emission reduction credits for electricity export, and hence on the country or grid to which the paper mill is connected. Thirdly, supplemental use of biomass to replace fossil fuel inputs is important to reduce the overall emissions of the pulp and paper industry. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

FRS may be associated with an impaired ability to correctly attribute an action to its origin. In the present study, we examined regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) with positron emission tomography during an action-attribution task in a group of patients with FRS. We used a device previously used with healthy subjects that allows the experimenter to modulate the subject's degree of movement control (and thus action attribution) of a virtual hand presented on a screen. In healthy subjects, the activity of the right angular gyrus and the insula cortex appeared to be modulated by the subject's degree of movement control of the virtual hand. In the present study, the schizophrenic patients did not show this pattern. We found an aberrant relationship between the subject's degree of control of the movements and rCBF in the right angular gyrus and no modulation in the insular cortex.

The study was performed with a model system consisting of the ECHAM4 atmospheric general circulation model coupled to a slab ocean and thermodynamic sea ice model. The model includes transport of the relevant chemical constituents, a sulfur chemistry model that calculates sulfate production in the gas and aqueous phase, and an aerosol model that accounts for source and sink processes. The aerosol cycle, the hydrological cycle, and the atmospheric dynamics are fully interactive. The climate response to aerosol forcing is not just a mirror image of the response to greenhouse forcing. This applies to the temperature changes, which are regionally more uniform for greenhouse forcing than for aerosol forcing as is already well known, and, in particular, to the hydrological cycle: the global hydrological sensitivity (Δprecip/Δtemp) to a I-K surface temperature change is almost 3 times higher for aerosol forcing than for greenhouse forcing. When both forcings are combined, a global warming is simulated while evaporation and precipitation decrease by about 2% K-1, resulting in a negative hydrological sensitivity. A strong dependency of the response to the type of forcing has also been found for the cloud water content and, consequently, for the change in cloud radiative forcing, which is substantially larger in the combined forcing experiment than in either of the individual forcing experiments. Consequently, the global warming for combined forcing is significantly smaller (0.57 K) than that obtained by adding the individual changes (0.85 K). Due to feedbacks between temperature changes and the hydrological cycle the simulated aerosol load, applying the same source strength, is considerably lower in a warmer climate (- 17% K-1 warming). A consequence of this aerosol-temperature feedback could be that a future increase in greenhouse gases may reduce the aerosol burden even if the source strength would not change. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Aerosols; Atmospherics; Climate change; Earth atmosphere; Greenhouses; Climate response; Greenhouse gases; Climatology; aerosol; atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; climate forcing; greenhouse gas; radiative forcing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942599266

TGM concentrations follow lognormal frequency distribution pattern, and the mean TGM concentration at the measurement site is 8.40 ng m-3 on the basis of 1 year observation. TGM concentrations in Guiyang are significantly elevated compared to the continental global background values. Coal combustion from both industrial and domestic uses is estimated to be the primary atmospheric source. A seasonal distribution pattern of TGM with a descending order of winter, spring, fall, and summer was observed. The highest TGM concentration in winter is attributed to household heating using coal. A consistent diurnal distribution pattern of TGM was obtained among all seasons, and the nighttime TGM concentration is elevated compared to the daytime values. Meteorological conditions are responsible for the formation of diurnal TGM distribution pattern. Tremendous efforts are needed to reduce mercury emissions from coal combustion to decrease TGM concentrations in Guiyang.

In each ballroom, measurements were carried out in business hours in the evening (20:30-24:00) on 7 consecutive days without any disturbance of the ballroom's normal operation. Nineteen out of the 21 target carbonyl compounds were identified in indoor and outdoor air. In the outdoor environment, formaldehyde was the most abundant carbonyl, followed by acetaldehyde, and there existed a strong correlation between formaldehyde and acetaldehyde. In the indoor air, however, acetaldehyde was the most abundant carbonyl, its concentrations seemed to be affected significantly by smoking. The indoor concentrations of carbonyls were found higher than their outdoor counterparts with only a few exceptions. Further studies concerning the indoor/outdoor ratios and mutual correlation of the carbonyls indicated that apart from direct emission from indoor materials and infiltration of outdoor air, other anthropogenic sources, e.g. tobacco smoke, also significantly contributed to carbonyl compounds. The possible sources of some high molecular weight carbonyls, e.g. nonanaldehyde, were also discussed briefly. Preliminary estimate of the exposures and risks due to carbonyls in the ballrooms was made, which indicated that long-term exposure in such places might cause increased chance of developing cancers. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, information regarding the release and exudation of organic carbon by living Sphagnum plants into the surface peat is scarce. In this study, we examined the contribution of recent Sphagnum subnitens (Russ. and Warnst.) photosynthate carbon to the peatland dissolved organic carbon (DOC) pool. This was done using a 13CO2 pulse-chase experimental approach during the growing season. Despite the importance of Sphagnum in long-term carbon accumulation, results showed that the Sphagnum community rapidly contributes recently synthesized carbon to the peatland DOC pool. We estimate that by 4 h up to 4% of the total DOC in peat leachate was derived from 13CO2 pulse labelling at ambient CO 2 concentrations. Nonetheless, a huge 64% of the 13C initially assimilated by photosynthesis was retained in Sphagnum subnitens for 23 days after labelling, consistent with the role of Sphagnum in peatland carbon accumulation. The majority of 13C loss as respired CO2 came within the few days post 13CO2 labelling, suggesting that it was derived from plant respiration of photosynthates.","13C; Carbon cycling; Exudation; Photosynthesis; Pulse labelling","carbon cycle; dissolved organic carbon; partitioning; peatland; photosynthesis; Sphagnum; Sphagnum subnitens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842638225

Therefore, extensive research concerning the reduction of fine particle emissions is needed to further improve air quality. Regarding health effects, especially the emission characteristics of fine and ultrafine particles emerging from anthropogenic sources such as combustion processes are of special interest. This study shows that the emission characteristic of an electrostatic precipitator (ESP) due to re-entrainment of fine particles and their subsequent release into the atmosphere can be significantly lowered by application of different operating conditions. For this purpose the particle collection efficiency of an ESP was studied in a municipal sewage sludge incineration plant. Particles were sampled under different operating conditions upstream and downstream from the ESP, and the particle number concentrations were measured simultaneously with aerodynamic particle sizers. In addition, the size distribution of the particles downstream from the ESP was measured with high time resolution by an electrical low-pressure impactor to investigate the particle re-entrainment into the flue gas. To determine the influence of operating conditions, different rapping cycles were investigated regarding their impact on the collection efficiency and the subsequent particle re-entrainment.",,"Air quality; Electrostatics; Flue gases; Health care; Particle size analysis; Particulate emissions; Precipitation (chemical); Refuse incineration; Sewage sludge; Atmospheric loads; Particle sizers; Environmental engineering; electrostatic precipitator; incineration; sewage; sludge; air pollution; air quality; article; atmosphere; combustion; electricity; electrostatic precipitation; incineration; measurement; particle size; precipitation; pressure; sewage treatment; sludge; Air Pollution; Electrostatics; Incineration; Particle Size; Precipitation; Refuse Disposal; Sewage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442349928

ICO involves introducing reactive chemicals to contaminated soils so that organics such as petroleum hydrocarbons are oxidised to environmentally innocuous compounds. This paper details two field trials that were undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of using a surface application of these oxidative treatments (Fenton's reagent, hydrogen peroxide and sodium hypochlorite) to remediate petroleum contaminated soil at Old Casey Station, East Antarctica. Results show that the ICO technology used at this site, where contamination occurred over a decade ago, did not significantly reduce petroleum hydrocarbon concentrations and would likely hinder biodegradation through the destruction of subsurface microbial communities. Further treatment testing and optimisation is required before ICO would be an effective remediation strategy for petroleum contaminated sites in Antarctica. However, the near complete destruction of subsurface microbiota, coupled with a discoloured orange soil residue and soil heating, mean that other more environmentally sensitive techniques such as bioremediation are our preferred treatment methodology. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Bacteria; Fenton reagent; Fenton-like process; Fuel spill remediation; NaHOCl","Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Concentration (process); Contamination; Diesel fuels; Heating; Hydrogen peroxide; Oxidation; In situ chemical oxidation (ICO); Microbial communities; Microbiota; Organics; Soil pollution; cold region; diesel; remediation; soil pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544305577

With payback periods that are often less than 1 year, significant savings can result. The success of the US oil and gas industry, working in partnership with EPA's Natural Gas STAR Program, demonstrates that the implementation of emissions-mitigation options can yield significant methane emissions reductions, cost savings, and increased profit. Internationally, the US experience suggests that there are significant cost-effective methane emissions reduction opportunities in the oil and natural gas sectors. Companies can take advantage of flexible emissions-trading mechanisms to develop projects internationally, allowing firms in developed countries to seek partners in developed or developing countries to reap mutual financial, social, aud GHG emissions reduction benefits. In addition to the financial benefits discussed here, pursuing natural gas emissions reductions also makes good environmental sense. With a global warming potential 23 times that of CO2, methane releases from natural gas system contribute substantially to global GHG loading to the atmosphere, and their mitigation has the potential to account for significant improvements in GHG emmisions levels.",,"Gas emissions; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Methane; Methane leaks; Natural gas emissions; Natural gas; emission control; gas industry; global warming; methane; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142724830

Urban particles were collected on quartz filters with a high-volume sampler coupled with a cascade impactor which separates particles into six size ranges: >10, 10-4.9, 4.9-2.7, 2.7-1.3, 1.3-0.6, and <0.6 μm. The total metal content, its distribution by size (physical speciation), and the concentrations of different chemical forms (chemical speciation) in particles less than 0.6 μm were determined. The chemical speciation scheme furnished four fractions: soluble and exchangeable metals; carbonates, oxides, and reducible metals; oxidisable and sulfidic metals bound to organic matter; and residual metals. The samples were analysed by ICP-OES for Pb, Ni, Cd, S, Fe, Zn, Cu, Ba, Mn, and V. Gaseous pollutants, traffic intensities, and primary meteorological data provided by the atmospheric and traffic networks were statistically related to the analytical data. Analytical and statistical results from physical and chemical speciation singled out Ba as a valid tracer of vehicular traffic, instead of Pb, in cities with high traffic density. Another important relationship was found between Pb and Cu. Physical speciation of lead showed that the major risk for health was from fine particles less than 2.7 μm, because particles between 2.7 and 0.6 μm were the size fractions of the total suspended particles with the major mass abundance of lead (mainly particles between 2.7 and 1.3 μm) and because particles less than 0.6 μm were the fraction of airborne particles most abundant in the urban air. Chemical speciation results showed that special attention must be taken with Ni and Cd concentrations, because of their high potential bioavailability, mainly a result of the high solubility of the chemical forms of Ni in the finest particles. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Airborne particles; Analytical characterisation; Chemical speciation; Heavy metals; Size fractionation; Traffic pollution","Air pollution; Fractionation; Lead; Meteorology; Nickel; Quartz; Solubility; Traffic control; Airborne particles; Analytical characterization; Chemical speciation; Size fractionation; Traffic pollution; Particles (particulate matter); heavy metal; air pollutant; article; environmental monitoring; instrumentation; methodology; particle size; season; sensitivity and specificity; Spain; weather; Air Pollutants; Environmental Monitoring; Metals, Heavy; Particle Size; Seasons; Sensitivity and Specificity; Spain; Weather",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-21044446823

In situ XANES/DRIFTS studies of the Pd chemical state at the surface and bulk of the materials were conducted to determine the noble metal response to the gas atmosphere during light off. The initial, oxidized PdO-like phase was converted to Pd(0) in all cases except for the ceria-zirconia-supported catalyst. Contact between Pd and bulk ceria-zirconia particles appeared to stabilize Pd clusters in the 373-673 K region with an average Pd(I)-like oxidation state. The presence of hydrocarbon in the gas phase was essential in order to stabilize these Pd(I)-like species. The role of such a phase in providing a source of active oxygen for hydrocarbon oxidation is shown here to strongly decrease light off temperature and this, together with its stability over a wide range of temperatures, may offer a contribution to reducing hydrocarbon emissions during cold start. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

Long tree-ring chronologies serve as climate proxies for the reconstruction of past, pre-instrument climate and its recent change. In tropical regions, the availability of exactly dated tree-ring chronologies is limited. The dendroclimatic potential of two dominant species from dry forests in northern Namibia was examined in the study presented in this paper. Both species (Burkea africana Hook and Pterocarpus angolensis DC) were sampled at two sites (ca. 900 km apart), and the response to several climatic variables, including ENSO indices, is studied. All specimens showed distinct growth rings and cross-dating between radii was successful for all trees. Species-specific mean curves were built for both sites. The mean curves of different species of the same site synchronised significantly, allowing the construction of a site-specific chronology. Synchronisation between sites was not possible, but spectral analysis of the chronologies implied that both show similar long-term (6.7 year) oscillation patterns. B. africana is more sensitive to rainfall variation than P. angolensis at both sites. Growth response to rainfall was positive, but a time-lag in the reaction occurred between the sites, corresponding to the time-lag of the beginning of the rainy season. Air temperature showed a negative correlation with stem increment at both sites. The response at the westernmost site to two ENSO indices indicates a tree growth decrease during El Niño years, which are generally dry in southern Africa. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Burkea africana; El Niño Southern Oscillation; Pterocarpus angolensis; Semiarid Africa; Tree rings","Air; Climate change; Oscillations; Rain; Thermal effects; Tree growth; Tree rings; Forestry; Burkea africana; Burkea africana; Pterocarpus angolensis; Pterocarpus angolensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242699723

Wood as a heating source has a long tradition in Sweden, but the use of compressed wood pellets in domestic stoves and boilers is rather new. Based on a literature survey, information from manufacturers and test institutes, this report gives an overview about existing technology and investigates how mature it is already. Some comparisons were made to similar heating units in Austria, where this technique is also widely used. It could be seen that the Austrian boilers are more sophisticated including a high level of comfort for the user. On the other hand the simpler Swedish boilers are significantly less expensive, and it is questionable if Swedish costumers are willing to pay for the higher comfort. Relevant regulations concerning emissions and fuel quality are also reported and compared between Sweden, Germany and Austria. In addition some interesting non-official certificates and environmental labels are presented. These give an outlook to future, probably more stringent, regulations. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

GWVs frequently recall an association between diesel and petrochemical fume exposure and symptoms during service. The purpose of the present study among GWVs was to evaluate the immediate health effects of acute exposure to chemicals (diesel vapors with acetaldehyde) with and without stress. Methods: In a single, controlled exposure to 5 parts per million (ppm) diesel vapors, symptoms, odor ratings, neurobehavioral performance, and psychophysiologic responses of 12 ill GWVs (GWV-I) were compared with 19 age- and gender-matched healthy GWVs (GWV-H). Results: Relative to baseline and to GWV-H, GWV-I reported significantly increased symptoms such as disorientation and dizziness and displayed significantly reduced end-tidal CO2 just after the onset of exposure. As exposure increased over time, GWV-I relative to GWV-H reported significantly increased symptoms of respiratory discomfort and general malaise. GWV-I were also physiologically hyporeactive in response to behavioral tasks administered during but not before exposure. Conclusions: Current symptoms among GWV-I may be exacerbated by ongoing environmental chemical exposures reminiscent of the Gulf War. Both psychologic and physiologic mechanisms contribute to current symptomatic responses of GWV-I.","Chemical sensitivity; Diesel vapors; GWVs; Hyperventilation; Psychophysiology","acetaldehyde; diesel fuel; adult; article; behavior; chemosensitivity; clinical article; cognition; controlled study; disability; disease exacerbation; disorientation; dizziness; end tidal carbon dioxide tension; environmental exposure; evaluation; exhaust gas; fatigue; female; human; hyperventilation; malaise; male; occupational exposure; odor; performance; priority journal; psychophysiology; rating scale; recall; respiratory tract disease; soldier; stress; symptom; task performance; time; United States; vapor; war",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242782381

Lebensm./Bioverfahrenstechnik, Bergstrasse 120, D-01062 Dresden, Germany","The elimination of heavy metals from bioleaching process waters (leachates) by electrolysis was studied in the anode and cathode region of a membrane electrolysis cell at current densities of 5-20 mA/cm2 using various electrode materials. The leaching waters containing a wide range of dissolved heavy metals, were high in sulfate, and had pH values of approx. 3. In preliminary tests using a rotating disc electrode the current density-potential curve (CPK) was recorded at a rotation velocity of 0, 1000 and 2000 rpm and a scan rate of 10 mV/s in order to collect information on the influence of transport processes on the electrochemical processes taking place at the electrodes. The electrochemical deposition-dissolution processes at the cathode are strongly dependent on the hydrodynamics. Detailed examination of the anodic oxidation of dissolved Mn(II) indicated that the manganese dioxide which formed adhered well to the electrode surface but in the cathodic return run it was again reduced. Electrode pairs of high-grade steel, lead and coal as well as material combinations were used to investigate heavy metal elimination in a membrane electrolysis cell. Using high-grade steel, lead and carbon electrode pairs, the reduction and deposition of Cu, Zn, Cr, Ni and some Cd in metallic or hydroxide form were observed in an order of 10-40% in the cathode chamber. The dominant process in the anode chamber was the precipitation of manganese dioxide owing to the oxidation of dissolved Mn(II). Large amounts of heavy metals were co-precipitated by adsorption onto the insoluble MnO2. High-grade steel and to some extent lead anodes were dissolved and hence were proven unsuitable as an anode material. These findings were largely confirmed by experiments using combination electrodes of coal and platinized titanium as an anode material and steel as a cathode material. With both electrode combinations and current densities of 5 or 10 mA/cm2, in the cathode region low depositions of 10-20 % Cd, 2-10% Mn, 5-20 % Zn, 1-20% Co and 5-15% Ni were measured. By contrast, the elimination of other metals was substantially larger: Fe 40-60 %, Cu 20-40%, and Cr 40-60%. In the anode region the removal of heavy metals was in the order of 30-50%, with Mn being as high as 80%. The anode materials exhibit good resistance at the current densities tested. The precipitates deposited in both electrode regions contained as main components Al with 10-20%, Mg with approximately 10%, and SO4 with 5-20%. The solid material in the cathode chamber consisted of relatively high proportions of Zn and Mn. Calcium in the solids indicated the co-precipitation of calcium sulfate. The main components in the solids of the anode chamber were Mn in the form of pyrolusite, Al as basic sulfate, and Mg. The results indicate that electrochemical metal separation in the membrane electrolysis cell can represent a practical alternative to the metal separation by alkalization. Regarding the main heavy metals Zn, Mn and Ni in the process water, combination electrodes using steel as a cathode material and coal or platinized titanium as an anode material proved to be suitable for eliminating the heavy metals from the aqueous phase. However, for practical application, further work is necessary to improve the efficiency, applicability and costs of the process. © 2004 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH &amp; Co.

It identifies many different funding regimes and organisations supporting greenhouse gas emissions reductions and a lack of data with which to measure progress. The work in the East Midlands and in the City of Leicester are summarised and an evaluation of progress towards Leicester's target of 50% carbon dioxide (CO2) emission reduction by 2025 based on 1990 is presented. Leicester's initiatives to reduce carbon emissions for the domestic and non-domestic sectors between 1996 and 1999 are analysed. Progress has been made in reducing the rate of rise in energy demand in Leicester and where energy efficiency activities have been concentrated, savings of 20-30% have been obtained. Significant CO2 savings are achievable at the local and regional level, but the streamlining of support mechanisms for local authorities and a clearer national framework to support implementation are needed to enable all, rather than a few, UK local authorities to make progress. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

Methods for imaging this ultra-weak luminescence have previously been limited by the sensitivity of the detection systems used. Results: We developed a novel configuration of a cooled charge-coupled device (CCD) for 2-dimensional imaging of light emission from biological material. In this study, we imaged photon emission from plant leaves. The equipment allowed short integration times for image acquisition, providing high resolution spatial and temporal information on bioluminescence. We were able to carry out time course imaging of both delayed chlorophyll fluorescence from whole leaves, and of low level wound-induced luminescence that we showed to be localised to sites of tissue damage. We found that wound-induced luminescence was chlorophyll-dependent and was enhanced at higher temperatures. Conclusions: The data gathered on plant bioluminescence illustrate that the equipment described here represents an improvement in 2-dimensional luminescence imaging technology. Using this system, we identify chlorophyll as the origin of wound-induced luminescence from leaves. © 2004 Flor-Henry et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"chlorophyll; Arabidopsis; chemistry; devices; fluorescence; luminescence; mechanical stress; metabolism; plant leaf; procedures; reproducibility; spectrofluorometry; temperature; time; Arabidopsis; Chlorophyll; Fluorescence; Luminescent Measurements; Plant Leaves; Reproducibility of Results; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Stress, Mechanical; Temperature; Time Factors",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12344281330

Far from simply allowing Annex I States to reduce the costs of meeting their GHG reduction commitments, the adoption of these mechanisms has led to the creation of numerous national and regional policies, and the development of new goods and services industries across the globe. These policy initiatives and new industries are the seeds from which innovative developments will grow. The validation process provides a vital tool to ensure CDM projects meet the highest standards. It also offers an insight into emissions trading schemes (ETSs) that has allowed this study to consider the wider implications for ETSs and make recommendations for future schemes, including how they could best be operated and managed. High quality CDM projects, with the potential to help nurtue more sustainable development paths for non-Annex I States, are being produced as the process of accreditation matures. The EB is well positioned to encourage further enhanced investment by improving the process of CDM accreditation though modality simplification and cost and time effective measures. The extent to which climate change mitigation policy has evolved in recent years has led to new development paths for national and regional governments, as well as industries such as finance, insurance and power supply in OECD states. To an extent these developments have been spurred on by the creation and ratification of the Kyoto Protocol.

Notwithstanding the scholarship on climate change itself, there are few studies on the nature of Arctic communities' vulnerability to climate-change risks. We review existing literature on implications of climate change for Arctic communities, develop a conceptual model of vulnerability, and present an analytical approach to assessing climate hazards and coping strategies in Arctic communities. Vulnerability is conceptualized as a function of exposure to climatic stresses and the adaptive capacity to cope with these stresses. The analytical framework employs place-specific case studies involving community residents and integrates information from multiple sources, both to document current exposures and adaptations and to characterize future exposures and adaptive capacity.","Adaptation; Adaptive capacity; Canadian Arctic; Climate change; Climatic risks; Communities; Environmental change; Inuit; Vulnerability","adaptive management; climate change; hazard management; natural hazard; vulnerability; Canada; Canadian Arctic; North America; Western Hemisphere; World",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144295216

It has been suggested that sulfate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation dominates carbon oxidation and attendant authigenic carbonate precipitation at these sites. To test this assumption, we have quantified the relative contributions of dissolved carbon dioxide (ΣCO2) from a variety of sources-specifically seawater, organic matter, methane, and non-methane liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons-using the carbon isotope compositions of authigenic carbonates and a simple isotopic mass balance. Our model, and a small but representative suite of data from the Gulf, demonstrates that methane is a contributor but is not the dominant source of metabolic energy at the sites of active venting. Instead, oxidation of non-methane hydrocarbons appears to be the primary source of carbonate alkalinity. The secondary role played by methane oxidation has been independently recognized by other workers from organic biomarker relationships and from disparities observed between measured rates of sulfate reduction and methane oxidation. Despite the domination of the carbon reservoir by non-methane sources, oxygen isotope data for the authigenic carbonates bear the mark of appreciable gas hydrate dissociation. This study, rather than being an exhaustive survey of Gulf of Mexico seeps, is intended only to provide a template for the investigation of the abundant authigenic carbonate deposits distributed throughout the geologic record. As in the Gulf of Mexico, many modern and ancient cold seeps are characterized by a complex interplay of carbon sources readily preserved in the δ13C values of carbonates. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Global climate change is likely to cause shifts in the timing of peak food availability, and in order to adapt successfully to current and future climate change, animals need to be able to adjust the time at which they initiate breeding. Many animals use environmental cues available before the breeding season to predict the seasonal peak in food availability and adjust their phenology accordingly. We tested the hypothesis that regulation of breeding onset should reflect the scale at which organisms perceive their environment by comparing phenology of three seabird species at a North Sea colony. As predicted, the phenology of two dispersive species, black-legged kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) and common guillemot (Uria aalge), correlated with a large-scale environmental cue (the North Atlantic Oscillation), whereas a resident species, European shag (Phalacrocorax aristotelis), was more affected by local conditions (sea surface temperature) around the colony. Annual mean breeding success was lower in late years for European shags, but not for the other two species. Since correlations among climate patterns at different scales are likely to change in the future, these findings have important implications for how migratory animals can respond to future climate change. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Climate change; NAO; North Sea; Oceanography; Seabirds; Timing of reproduction","climate change; phenology; reproduction; seabird; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea; Animalia; Phalacrocorax; Phalacrocorax aristotelis; Rissa tridactyla; Uria; Uria aalge",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242681304

The processes considered include changes in microbial biomass of C and N, microbial number, respiration rates, organic matter decomposition, soil enzyme activities, microbial community composition, and functional groups of bacteria mediating trace gas emission such as methane and nitrous oxide. Elevated CO2 in atmosphere may enhance certain microbial processes such as CH4 emission from wetlands due to enhanced carbon supply from plants.

We provide a quantitative estimation of the carbon absorption potential per hectare and the surface of agricultural land that is available and suitable for the implementation of those measures, their environmental effects as well as the effects on farm income. Realistically, agricultural soils in EU-15 can sequester up to 16-19 Mt C year-1 during the first Kyoto commitment period (2008-2012), which is less than one fifth of the theoretical potential and equivalent to 2% of European anthropogenic emissions. We identified as most promising measures: the promotion of organic inputs on arable land instead of grassland, the introduction of perennials (grasses, trees) on arable set-aside land for conservation or biofuel purposes, to promote organic farming, to raise the water table in farmed peatland, and - with restrictions - zero tillage or conservation tillage. Many options have environmental benefits but some risk of increasing N2O emissions. For most measures it is impossible to determine the overall impact on farm profitability. Efficient carbon sequestration in agricultural soils demands a permanent management change and implementation concepts adjusted to local soil, climate and management features in order to allow selection of areas with high carbon sequestering potential. Some of the present agricultural policy schemes have probably helped to maintain carbon stocks in agricultural soils. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We argue that at the current stage of development, substitution of conventional car technology by a new automotive propulsion technology may lead to premature lock-in of suboptimal technology. To avoid such lock-in, one should value the variety of current R&D activity that enables organizations to learn from multiple options and to create spillovers between options. We further argue that the existence of technological variety is not a sufficient condition to avoid lock-in. Organizational variety is also required to sustain competition and avoid the dominance of few firms that possibly enforce a suboptimal technology within the sector. To assess whether recent developments in R&D have led to both technological variety and organizational competition, we analyze United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) patents in low-emission vehicles (LEVs) during the period 1980-2001 using entropy statistics. Results show that both technological variety and organizational competition have increased steadily since the early nineties, suggesting that premature lock-in is unlikely to occur.

A semi-quantitative method is proposed to compare the charge storage capability of polyaromatic hydrocarbon molecules (PAHs). For planar PAHs, the ability to store electrical energy is found to be to a large extend determined by a single parameter, that is the electronic hardness (half the electronic gap) multiplied the number of carbon atom in the molecule.

The aim of this paper is to look into economic reasons for the political infeasibility of extensive carbon taxes. Since opposition is believed to arise prior to the policy implementation, the cost estimates have a myopic character compared with market estimates, in the sense that sectors are presumed to take into account their own substitution opportunities, but disregard changes in other sectors as well as the macroeconomic welfare gains from a tax regime. With this myopic approach, we estimate and compare costs of emissions cuts across sectors and across countries in the EU, showing how different sectors might have anticipated the impacts from an expected carbon tax. This focus illustrates that what seems to be cost-effective and to the best for the region on paper turned out too controversial to be politically feasible. Three main conclusions are drawn. First, common measures across countries are generally not attractive since a particular measure may be advantageous to one country in order to keep the national cost of climate policy down, but may in another country spur opposition that could be avoided if exceptions were allowed. Second, the electricity sector plays a key role in climate policy in every EU country and in the potential opposition to any policy measure. Conditions in this sector vary greatly among countries, and a long-term strategy to reduce conflicts of interest would be to introduce a common electricity market. Third, before a common electricity market can be established, further differentiation of national emission targets could represent an important opportunity for mitigating conflicts of interests across countries.","Climate policy; EU; Interest conflicts; Opposition; Political infeasibility; Regional carbon tax","carbon emission; economic instrument; emission control; environmental economics; European Union; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; World",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13644273242

This plan calls for a 28% NOx cut in the summer time (1.2 million tons) by 2007. This calls for utilities to develop new, efficient, and robust post-combustion NOx control technologies. A new environmental control technology called low temperature oxidation (LTO) system, which can reduce NOx emissions below measurable levels (i.e. 2 ppm using process analyzers) at low temperature (125-325 °F), was awarded the best available control technology and the lowest available emission reduction technology by the US EPA in April 1998. Ozone is employed to oxidize nitric oxide (NO) to dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) at a low temperature in an oxidizer, which is then easily absorbed by water in a scrubber. Bench scale and pilot plant tests have shown that the LTO process can almost completely remove the NOx emissions (i.e. NOx emissions are below levels measurable using process analyzers). This proved that the LTO system is an attractive process to meet the stricter NOx regulations. There are multiple benefits of the LTO system besides removal of NOx emissions, includes reduction of SOx and CO emissions, and no secondary air emissions (NH3, N2O). In order to obtain minimum NOx emissions, extra ozone needs to be supplied. The cost of the process also increases nonlinearly as emissions decrease. This poses a challenging multiobjective optimization problem where emissions like NOx and SOx need to be minimized, while minimizing the system cost as well as extra ozone. This problem is addressed using a new and efficient multiobjective optimization framework.

The following features have been examined: 1) extent of the amorphous fraction (heat associated α ↔ β transition of quartz) and its solubility in HF; 2) potential to cleave a carbon-hydrogen bond with consequent generation of carbon centred radicals (spin trapping technique, EPR); 3) evolution of surface functionalities upon heating (FTIR spectroscopy); 4) mechanisms of adsorption of water on dusts outgassed at 150° and at 800°C (adsorption calorimetry). HCl treated samples have also been examined. The two ""less toxic"" quartzes are more resistant to HF attack, coordinate irreversibly H2O molecules and exhibit strong adsorption sites, which are absent in the other two and in a very pure quartz dust. Conversely all samples show the same potential to release free radicals. The different behaviour of the two sets of dust is consistent with a different level of impurities, namely aluminium ex kaolin, carbon and alkaline ions. The less inflammogenic quartzes appear to be covered by aluminium ions (and possibly iron) which strongly holds molecular water or carbonates, thus reducing the silanol patches to a large extent and changing the surface properties of the particles. We hypothesize that cellular response, and particularly macrophage activation and death, is mediated by strong interactions between silanol patches and some cell membrane components, but inhibited when the surface of the particle is modified by the presence of aluminium ions, surface carbonates and other metal contaminants. This hypothesis suggests that grinding procedures with little appropriate additives, e.g. kaolin, alumina, can reduce the biological activity of quartz dusts.","Aluminium; Hydrophilicity; Metal contaminants; Quartz; Quartz toxicity; Silanols; Surface crystallinity","aluminum; carbon; carbonic acid; free radical; hydrochloric acid; hydrogen; iron; kaolin; metal; silanol; silicon dioxide; unclassified drug; adsorption; article; calorimetry; cell membrane; chemical analysis; chemical interaction; drug activity; electron spin resonance; hydration; hydrogen bond; hydrophilicity; in vitro study; in vivo study; inflammation; macrophage activation; solubility; spectroscopy; spin trapping; surface property; water vapor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1342311246

The relative energy spectra as well as the angular distributions of the 10Be+n center of mass system (inelastic angular distributions) have been extracted both for Pb and C targets. For the breakup of 11Be on Pb, the selection of forward-scattering angles, corresponding to large impact parameters, is found to be effective to extract almost purely the first-order E1 Coulomb breakup component and to exclude the nuclear contribution and higher-order Coulomb breakup components. This angle-selected energy spectrum is thus used to deduce the spectroscopic factor for the 10Be(0+) ⊗ ν2s1\2 configuration in 11Be which is found to be 0.72±0.04 with a B(E1) strength up to Ex=4 MeV of 1.05±0.06 e2 fm2. The energy weighted E1 strength up to Ex=4 MeV explains 70% ± 10% of the cluster sum rule, consistent with the obtained spectroscopic factor. The non-energy-weighted sum rule within the same energy range is used to extract the root-mean-square distance of the halo neutron to be 5.77(16) fm, consistent with previously known values. In the breakup with the carbon target, we have observed the excitations to the known unbound states in 11Be at Ex = 1.78 MeV and Ex=3.41 MeV. Angular distributions for these states show the diffraction pattern characteristic of L=2 transitions, resulting in a Jπ=(3/2,5/2)+ assignment for these states. We finally find that even for the C target the E1 Coulomb direct breakup mechanism becomes dominant at very forward angles.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12344276428

After subtracting the air-water exchanges of O2 and CO2, the chemical and biochemical changes in DO (dissolved oxygen) and DIC (dissolved inorganic carbon) were estimated in order to evaluate MQ (metabolic quotient: DO change divided by DIC change) at intervals of 1 hour. By removing small absolute changes below the threshold value (0.01 mM h-1), the averaged values of the 24 MQ means for the respective 1-hour periods ranged from 0.96 to 1.20 in the six enclosures. Because the MQs in the daytime inversely correlated well with the ratio of NH4+-N to (NH4+-N + NO 3--N), not the ecosystems, i.e., density of fish, community structure of zooplankton and phytoplankton, but the form of nitrogen uptaken for primary production principally determined the MQs. The higher MQs observed in the daytime compared with the nighttime (from 14% to 21% except 3% for one enclosure) could not be explained by the denitrification and/or dissolution of CaCO3 in the sediments, therefore suggesting the selectively faster decomposition of part of the organic matter provided through primary production, in other words, an accumulation of another part of the organic matter in the diurnal and/or daily time scale.","DO and pH; Enclosure experiment; Metabolic quotient; Silver carp","Algae; Biomass; Fisheries; Metabolism; pH effects; Sediments; Free-water method; Silver carp density; Water; dissolved inorganic carbon; dissolved oxygen; enclosure experiment; measurement method; metabolism; pH; algae; Cyprinus carpio; Hypophthalmichthys nobilis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542351354

However, the majority of adverse health impacts of climate change can be avoided by implementing suitable adaptation policies. Planned adaptation to the health impacts of climate change comprises a broad range of public health interventions. Most of these measures are not only effective in a changed climate but they also current health risks. Successful planned adaptation depends on an awareness of and information about the problem, on the existence of effective response strategies, and on the availability of the resources, information, and incentives to actually implement them. The main challenges in developing adaptation strategies for human health are to account for the diversity of health impairments, regional conditions and adaptation actors, and for the large uncertainty about future changes in most climate-sensitive health risks. This report reviews a broad range of 'conceptual frameworks of adaptation' as to their relevance for assessments of planned adaptations to the health impacts of climate change. These frameworks originate from the largely distinct communities concerned with climate change, public health, natural hazards, and risk management. The term 'conceptual framework of adaptation' is used here to denote any representation of concepts that can assist the design and assessment of policy strategies aimed at reducing climate-sensitive health effects. In our review, we distinguish the following categories of conceptual frameworks: typologies of climate change assessments; guidelines for climate change risk assessments; conceptual frameworks for vulnerability and adaptation to climate change; typologies of adaptation measures and adaptive systems; and evaluation frameworks for adaptation strategies. We fnd that no single approach to adaptation policy assessment can deal with the diversity of climate-sensitive health impairments, regions, and information needs of adaptation actors. Further more, no single conceptual framework addresses all questions that are important in adaptation assessments for human health. However, the review of the diverse set of conceptual frameworks enables us to name the most important guidelines for human health vulnerability and adaptation assessment; to identify those criteria that determine the most suitable approach for assessing adaptation to the health effects of climate change in different decision situations; to evaluate the potential for and urgency of planned adaptation; and to identify key questions for developing and implementing effective adaptation strategies to be addressed in any adaptation assessment for human health.",,"climate change; health impact; health risk; policy implementation; risk assessment",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144285578

Our aim was to study this phenomenon using 3 different techniques and to analyze the correlation among them. Methods: The study population consisted of 55 patients who had undergone heart transplantation 0.5 to 160 months earlier. We used a control group of 10 healthy individuals for comparison. To detect re-innervation, we used 1) planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scintigraphic imaging of cardiac sympathetic activity with 123I- metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG), 2) analysis of heart-rate variability based on 24-hour Holter recordings; and 3) immunohistochemical study of endomyocardial biopsy specimens with anti-S100 antibody. Results: The SPECT images showed evidence of sympathetic re-innervation in 17 patients (31%), predominantly in the anterior and in the septal regions of the left ventricle. Sympathetic activity increased during the post-transplant time course (r = 0.32; p = 0.017), although it did not reach normal values. We found a correlation between the low-frequency component of heart-rate variability (a marker of sympathetic activity) and the degree of MIBG uptake according to scintigraphy (r = 0.32; p = 0.015). Immunostaining study demonstrated the existence of nerve fibers in 36 patients (65%) who had greater values of heart-rate variability parameters reflecting parasympathetic activity. Conclusions: The 3 techniques evidenced re-innervation after heart transplantation. A correlation exists between sympathetic activity detected using MIBG scintigraphy and analysis of heart-rate variability.

We present new multiepoch and multifrequency radio observations of NGC 6240 obtained using the Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA). These observations resolve out all of the diffuse radio continuum emission related to starburst activity to reveal three compact sources, two associated with the infrared and X-ray nuclei: components N1, the northern nucleus, and S, the southern nucleus; and component S1, a weak point source lying northeast of component S. The radio continuum properties of N1 and S both resemble those of compact radio sources in Seyfert nuclei, including an inverted spectrum at low frequencies and high brightness temperatures. Component N1 further resolves into a 9 pc linear source, again resembling compact jets in some well-studied Seyfert nuclei. The inverted radio spectrum is most likely caused by free-free absorption through foreground plasma with emission measures on the order of 107 cm -6 pc, consistent with the X-ray spectroscopy, which implies the presence of a foreground, Compton-thick absorber. Synchrotron self-absorption may also contribute to the flat spectrum of component S. Component S1 better resembles a luminous radio supernova such as those detected in Arp 220, although we cannot specifically rule out the possibility that S1 may be ejected material from the southern active nucleus. We demonstrate that the light curve of S1 is at least consistent with current radio supernova (RSN) models, and given the high star formation rate in the nuclear region and the (possible) proclivity of infrared merger galaxies to produce luminous RSNe, it is not surprising that one such supernova is detected serendipitously in the VLBA observations.","Galaxies: active; Galaxies: individual (NGC 6240); Galaxies: nuclei; Galaxies: Seyfert; Supernovae: general",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842811806

The panel data model alleviates possible collinearity among climatic variables, accounts for the effect of omitted or unobserved variables, and incorporates natural and human adaptation, thus representing a more robust approach to analyzing climate change impacts. SPB outbreaks in Louisiana and Texas appeared to move together; infestations in Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi, South Carolina, North Carolina, and Tennessee were highly correlated; and Virginia demonstrated its unique temporal pattern of SPB outbreaks. Salvage harvest was found to be helpful in lessening future infestation risk. Warmer winters and springs would positively contribute to SPB outbreaks with spring temperature showing a more severe and persistent impact than winter temperature; increases in fall temperature would ease SPB outbreaks; and summer temperature would have a mixed impact on SPB infestations. Compared to temperature, precipitation would have a much smaller impact on SPB infestations. While increases in the previous winter, spring, and fall precipitation would enhance SPB outbreak risk in the current year, a wetter summer would reduce infestations 3 years later. Global climate change induced by doubling atmospheric CO2 concentration would intensify SPB infestation risk by 2.5-5 times. If the changes in the area and productivity of southern pine forests due to climate change are accounted for, SPB would cause even more severe damage, 4-7.5 times higher than the current value of trees killed annually. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Differentiation between physiological or pathological etiologies is necessary. Benzodiazepine premedication to reduce physiological uptake has been attempted with variable success. A relationship between brown-fat FDG uptake and cold temperature has also been established. To our knowledge, no case reports or studies have been published to demonstrate whether controlling the temperature can alter the physiological uptake in these regions. Procedures: Two teenage female patients with these patterns on PET scans performed with oral benzodiazepine administration underwent repeat imaging with temperature-controlled environment settings. Results: Resol ution of supraclavicular FDG uptake with temperature control in two patients in whom benzodiazepine had no prior effect. Conclusion: Although the exact mechanism remains unknown, we propose that the control of temperature reduces the metabolism of glucose by brown fat. Further studies are warranted to confirm the above observations, and, if confirmed, to determine the most efficient and effective use of temperature control to minimize supraclavicular and axillary FDG uptake. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

(1) The characterization of the spatial and temporal variability of these emissions is an important and urgent target for greenhouse-gas and global change studies. In this respect a series of technical specifications are demanded by the scientific community, including sensor portability, low detection limit and the need of analyzing small volumes of gas. Solid-state gas sensors are increasingly used for environmental measurements. A metal oxide semiconductor (e.g., SnO2, ZnO2,) is used to fabricate chemical sensors for several gases, in particular methane. The potential of this technique is based on the low conductivity of the material in clean air, which increases with the methane gas concentration in the air. Sensitivity, selectivity, power consumption, long-term stability, and reaction time are all linked together. They all depend on the physico-chemical and geometrical structure of the sensitive layer. This means that improving one parameter has an influence on the others. Therefore, it is necessary to make compromises and select the combination of performances that best meet the application requirements.","Methane measurements; Sno2; Solid-state gas sensors","Air; Electric conductivity; Electric power utilization; Environmental engineering; Greenhouse effect; Methane; MOS devices; Soils; Tin compounds; Water; Zinc oxide; Environment research; Geometrical structure; Natural systems; Solid-state gas sensors; Chemical sensors; methane; sensor",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144290196

Sublethal levels of UVR can select for simple responses in larval amphibians, such as dark pigmentation or preference for UVR-protected microhabitats (i.e., under cover or in deep water). This study focuses on color response to UVR, and whether avoidance behaviors like refuge use and depth choice depend on larval body color. We quantified responses to ambient levels of UVR in four experiments in semi-field conditions using two sister species of salamander larvae that differ in their evolutionary history of UVR exposure. Both Ambystoma barbouri and A. texanum larvae darkened in response to UVR, and when given the choice of refuge, significantly increased the proportion of time spent in hiding. Additionally, both species used deeper microhabitats when exposed to UVR, but only A. barbouri larvae showed a preference for shallow waters when UVR was blocked out. Neither of these behaviors seemed to be color dependent, with larvae from both species taking refuge and preferring deep water in the presence of UVR, regardless of body color. Interesting behavioral trade-offs arose when larvae were confronted with conflicting selection pressures from UVR and predation risk. Risk from predatory fish forces larvae to shallow areas, while UVR forces larvae into deeper water. Thus, the combination of the two selection pressures creates a conflict in optimal depth choice. Faced with this conflict, A. barbouri preferred deeper, risky areas to shallow water with high UVR exposure. Ambystoma texanum responded to predation risk with a preference for shallow water, but did not significantly alter depth in response to UVR. Given the opportunity to mediate exposure to UVR and predation risk by altering depth choices, neither species changed color in response to either UVR or predation risk. Overall, these changes in behavior and color may affect larval feeding, competition, and predation rates and could thus alter aquatic community structure.","Ambystoma barbouri; Ambystoma texanum; Antipredator behavior; Behavioral responses to UV-B; Color change; Depth choice; Global climate change and conservation strategies; Microhabitat use; Refuge; Salamanders (Kentucky, USA); Selection pressures, conflicting","adaptation; amphibian; color; habitat use; predation risk; ultraviolet radiation; Ambystoma; Ambystoma barbouri; Ambystoma barbouri; Ambystoma texanum; Ambystoma texanum; Amphibia; Amphiuma means; Caudata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444250827

Specifically, soils deserve a close examination due to their large carbon mitigation potential. The Kyoto protocol establishes the possibility for crediting greenhouse gas emission reductions from forestry and agriculture activities. In most circumstances, particularly those regarding developing countries, greenhouse gas mitigation activities will be carried out through projects. These projects will have to meet a series of criteria, for the carbon benefits to be measurable, transparent, verifiable and certified. These criteria include: establishing credible baselines (without-project or reference scenario), additionality, permanence, quantifying and reducing potential leakage of greenhouse gases across project borders, coping with natural or human induced risks, accurately measuring changes in carbon stocks using carbon accounting techniques, and - in the case of the Clean Development Mechanism - resulting in sustainable development benefits. In this paper we describe the methods and approaches that have been developed to cope with the different criteria and discuss their implications for carbon sequestration in soils. Soil carbon represents the largest carbon pool of terrestrial ecosystems, and has been estimated to have one of the largest potentials to sequester carbon worldwide. However, getting credits from soil carbon sequestration through project activities presents several challenges: the need to monitor small incremental changes in soil carbon content relative to large carbon pools, long-time periods to accrue the full carbon benefits, high local variability of soil carbon content, and relatively costly soil carbon measurement procedures. Also, the responses of soil C stocks to forestry and agriculture activities are complex and need careful attention. Specifically, the time dynamics of soil C responses to land use changes, the diversity of soil types, soil-plant interactions, and the availability of accurate soil C inventories, should be considered to successfully implement LULUCF projects.",,"Carbon sequestration; Greenhouse gases; Carbon; Ecosystems; Environmental protection; Erosion; Greenhouse effect; Soil conservation; Climate change; assessment method; carbon sequestration; emission control; forestry; Kyoto Protocol; land use change; soil carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444265863

Presently, agriculture and livestock related emissions contribute above 65% of Indian CH4 emissions and above 90% of N 2O emissions. Since these activities are widely dispersed, with a considerable portion being sub-sustenance activities, emission mitigation requires considerable efforts. We use geographical information system (GIS) interfaced Asia-Pacific Integrated Model (AIM/Enduse), which employs technology share projections, for estimating future CH4 and N2O emissions. The future emissions and mitigation flexibility are analyzed for a reference scenario and two mitigation scenarios (medium and strong). Future CH4 emissions in 2030 are projected to reach 24.4Tg (reference scenario), 21.3Tg (medium mitigation scenario) and 17.6Tg (strong mitigation scenario). Future CH4 emission scenarios indicate rising shares of municipal solid waste (MSW) and coal bed methane, where mitigation technologies have good penetration potential. Improved cattle feed and digesters, and better rice paddy cultivation practices that are adopted for higher yields and improved irrigation coverage also offer CH4 mitigation as ancillary benefits. Future N2O emissions in 2030 are projected to reach 0.81Tg (reference scenario), 0.69Tg (medium mitigation scenario) and 0.6Tg (strong mitigation scenario). Better utilization of nitrogen fertilizer and increased use of organic fertilizers, partly produced from MSW, offer interesting mitigation opportunities for N2O emissions. Some of these technology initiatives are already visible in India at different stages of development and appropriate policy thrust may strengthen them in future. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

LPG represents 16% of the total fuel consumption in the MZVM and its demand increased 14% from 1986 to 1999. Propane and butanes, the main compounds of LPG, constituted 29% of all non-methane hydrocarbons found in the air of Mexico City. Some researchers have reported that LPG losses are a significant cause of high ozone concentration in MZVM. Three analyses are carried out in this work to estimate LPG's share of responsibility for MZVM pollution problems. First, the correlation between LPG consumption and three ozone pollution indicators was calculated for the period of 1986-1999. The non-significant correlation of these indicators with LPG consumption in a monthly basis suggests that LPG associated emissions are not the foremost cause of ozone formation. Second, a simulation model is applied to three LPG related emission control strategies to estimate the reduction in the maximum ozone concentration. The most noticeable effect was obtained when both hydrocarbon (HC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emissions associated with LPG use were totally reduced. The other two strategies, that only reduce HC emissions, had a minimum effect on the ozone concentration. Third, organic compounds consumption in air samples captured and irradiated in outdoor smog chambers is used to determine the chemical loss rate of LPG associated species and aromatics in the MZVM. The smog chamber results showed that 70% of propane and n-butane remain at the end of a 1-day irradiation, therefore they remain in the MZVM atmosphere for several days being the reason for the high concentration of these compounds. LPG associated compounds only account for 18% of ozone formed but aromatics contribute 35% to ozone in smog chamber. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It is concluded that the observed 40-yr trend in the global heat content to 300 m, found by Levitus et al., is somewhat larger than the natural variability in the CCSM2 control run. The observed 40-yr trend in the global heat content down to a depth of 3 km is much closer to trends found in the control run and is not so clearly separated from the natural model variability. It is estimated that, in a 0.7% increasing CO2 scenario that approximates the effect of increasing greenhouse gases between 1958 and 1998, the CCSM2 40-yr trend in the global heat content to 300 m is about the same as the observed value. This gives support for the CCSM2 climate sensitivity, which is 2.2°C. Both the maximum of the meridional overturning streamfunction and the vertical flow across 1-km depth between 60° and 65°N decrease monotonically during the 1% CO2 run. However, the reductions are quite modest, being 3 and 2 Sv, respectively, when CO 2 has quadrupled. The reason for this is that the surface potential density in the northern North Atlantic decreases steadily throughout the 1% CO2 run. In the latter part of the doubled CO2 run, the meridional overturning streamfunction recovers in strength back toward its value in the control run, but the deep-water formation rate across 1-km depth between 60° and 65°N remains at 85% of the control run value. The maximum northward heat transport at 22°N is governed by the maximum of the overturning, but the transport poleward of 62°N appears to be independent of the deep-water formation rate. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Heat flux; Oceanography; Surfaces; Water; Community Climate System Model, version 2 (CCSM2); Heat transport; Thermohaline circulations; Climatology; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate modeling; heat transfer; thermohaline circulation; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); oceanic regions; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744226631

These codes include detailed radiative transfer models and simplified codes for global climate models. The importance of the various radiatively active gases are examined. Water vapor is the most important contributor to the TTL radiation balance, but carbon dioxide and ozone also play a role. Differences in radiative heating between radiation models are mostly due to treatments of shortwave radiation. Differences between models below the TTL are due to different treatments of water vapor continuum absorption. The level of zero clear sky radiative heating, a level important for understanding the transport of air into the stratosphere, is generally found near 15 km, 125 hPa and 200°K (360 K potential temperature), consistent with previous work. Changes in time and space can modify this level by ±500 m, and individual profiles vary from these averages by ±400 m (1σ). Increases in water vapor in the TTL would tend to increase the altitude of the level at which the net heating is zero, while increases in carbon dioxide or ozone would tend to decrease this level. Clouds in the TTL tend to increase the level due to enhancements in longwave cooling above clouds. The implications for transport are discussed.

Paleomagnetic investigation and 40Ar/39Ar dating of a tephra layer, 10 m above the eolian sand, suggest that the sand was deposited between about 2.7 and 2.4 Ma. This age is coeval with the global climatic deterioration that occurred at the Middle-Upper Pliocene transition. Eolian sediments are represented by cross-bedded sand, rippled sand and horizontal-bedded sand. The alluvial deposits, associated with the eolian sediment, consist of sheet-like beds of coarse sand and erosively based, pebbly sand bodies. Eolian sand, together with fluvial sandy deposits, was formed in the medial-distal portion of an alluvial system, and represents the Rena Bianca Sand Unit. The eolian and alluvial deposits are arranged into sedimentary cycles (2-6 m thick), displaying a wetting-drying-wetting upward trend recording second-order climatic oscillations of ca. 40 ka. Each cycle is enclosed between major bounding surfaces, defined by iron mineral encrustations. These bounding surfaces represent periods of reduced eolian sand accumulation caused by a rising water table. During the 2.5 Ma global cooling, the Valdarno Basin experienced a period of arid conditions owing to the influence of cold and dry easterly and northeasterly winds. In contrast, during the Pleistocene, the uplift of the Pratomagno Ridge protected the Valdarno Basin from easterly and northeasterly winds, giving rise to relatively warm and wet conditions, and mitigating the regional and global climatic changes. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Six alternative mitigation policies representing types of greenhouse gas offsets allowed are considered. Results indicate that the largest quantity of greenhouse gas offset consistently appears with the mitigation policy that pays for all opportunities. Restricting carbon payments (emission tax or sequestration subsidy) only to aff/deforestation or only to agricultural sequestration substantially reduces potential mitigation. Higher carbon prices lead to more sequestration, less emissions, reduced consumer and total welfare, improved environmental indicators and increased producer welfare.","Agricultural and forest sector; greenhouse gas; mitigation strategies; sequestration and emissions reductions","carbon emission; carbon sequestration; emission control; greenhouse gas; mitigation; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3943058964

Instrumental and historical data give evidence of the sensitivity of this domain to broad, regional-scale oceanic and atmospheric anomalies. Our investigation of the paleohydrological variability off Northern Iceland throughout the last 10 000 cal yr suggests that atmospheric forcing alone, through combined changes in strength of the wind stress curl and sea-level atmospheric pressure pattern over the Nordic Seas, is sufficient to explain the recorded changes in origins and dynamics of surface and intermediate water masses. Our biotic proxies, coccoliths and benthic foraminifera, were extracted from a giant piston core (MD99-2269) collected in a shelf trough where sediment accumulated at an excess rate of 2 m/kyr. The mid-Holocene from 6.5 to 3.5 cal kyr BP was a time of peaked carbonate production and subsequent sedimentation, and strong water-column stratification with a thick layer of cold-fresh Arctic surface water overlapping an enhanced flow of Irminger/Atlantic Intermediate water. Applying conditions triggering present-time carbonate plankton blooms in the studied area, we infer that a lowered cyclonic activity associated with decreased winter storms and reduced production of Arctic Intermediate Water in the Iceland Sea were conductive of the recorded mid-Holocene water column structure. The opposite situation (warm Atlantic surface water, low vertically-integrated inflow of Irminger water, abutment of Arctic Intermediate water in deep shelf troughs) characterized the early Holocene as well as a shorter late Holocene period centred at 2 cal kyr BP. The Little Ice Age (ca. 0.2-0.6 cal kyr BP) and a short event at around 3 cal kyr BP stand as times of extreme advection of polar waters and extended sea-ice development. A comparison of the recorded long-term Holocene evolution of water column structure off Northern Iceland with climate and hydrological changes in the north-eastern Atlantic suggests that the strength of Atlantic inflow into the Nordic Seas was subjected to a balance between the Irminger and the Norwegian branches.

The high emissions characteristic of this engine design creates localized acute air pollution problems and contributes significantly to global air pollution (Gorham 2002). A compression pressurized direct fuel injection system (CPDI) has been proposed as a lower cost alternative to the common air blast direct injection system (ABDI). This paper describes the application of the CPDI system as a retrofit to a two-stroke engine typical of those used in ""tricycle"" transports in the Philippines. Power production, emissions, and fuel consumption for the original carbureted engine, the ABDI system and the CPDI system are also compared. The DI systems show a significant reduction in both hydrocarbons (88% reduction for the ABDI system and 86% reduction for the CPDI system) and carbon monoxide (49% for the air blast system, 83% for the compression pressurized system), and similar power compared to the carbureted engine. © 2004 Society of Automotive Engineers of Japan, Inc.",,"Air pollution; Carbon monoxide; Developing countries; Engines; Fuels; Machine design; Retrofitting; Emissions characteristics; Fuel injection systems; Pollution problems; Power production; Pressurized systems; Small displacement; Transportation needs; Two-stroke engine; Direct injection",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979036239

We analyse the influence of different power generation technologies on CO 2 emission volume and abatement cost based on energy market and electricity demand prospects, and least-cost expansion of electricity generating system. In the latter model, we take into account electricity supply quality and CO 2 emission. The CO 2 abatement cost is estimated in a period of time rather than the traditional abatement cost estimation performed for a target year. The proposed model is applied to the case of Shanghai Municipality in China to assess potential role of natural gas combined cycle and nuclear power plants in mitigation of CO 2 emission. Impact of the baseline technology choice on CO 2 abatement cost is analysed through the formulation of three scenarios. For the first one (""Baseline"" scenario), it is assumed that expansion of the electricity supply system is based only on coal-fired power plants; for the second scenario, it is supposed that the decision makers have already envisaged the use of natural gas combined cycle power plants (CCPP) in addition to coal fired ones; the third scenario mixes coal-fired, natural gas CCPP and nuclear power plants. It is found that on the horizon of the study (2020), maximum CO 2 emission mitigation potential of natural gas CCPPs can reach 42.4 million tons (MtCO 2), whereas maximum CO 2 emission reduction potential of nuclear power plants can be 298.2 MtCO 2. The CO 2 abatement cost estimation falls into the range from US$19/tCO 2 to US$51/tCO 2 depending on the level of imposed CO 2 penalty, volume of carbon emission reduction and baseline technology choice. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

They are widely found in nature in permafrost and deep-sea sediments and hold huge potential as a methane gas resource. As a result, a National Methane Hydrate RandD program was launched in 2000 by the United States Department of Energy. One of the projects under the program, run by the National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL/DOE DE-FC26-01NT41331), is to drill, core, and test one gas hydrate well in the Prudhoe Bay/Kuparuk River area of northern Alaska. In this project, cores are studied to gather field data on a hydrate reservoir in permafrost regions. Tests were required to develop coring techniques and handling procedures on frozen rocks prior to actual coring in Alaska. These tests were performed at a Houston research facility where frozen rocks were prepared using an apparatus fabricated to simulate hydrate reservoir in permafrost. The permafrost formation was simulated with a water-saturated sand pack, which was frozen using liquid nitrogen. Frozen rocks of up to 3.6 m (12 ft) high and 0.254 m (10 in.) diameter were prepared with the apparatus. The setup was designed and evaluated in several stages. First, a computer model was developed to understand the rock-freezing process. Then a prototype setup was constructed to have similar radial dimensions as the full-scale apparatus, but with a smaller height. Several experiments were performed to test the prototype and the full-scale apparatus. The apparatus has been successfully employed to prepare frozen rock, thereby assisting in development of improved coring methodology for Alaskan permafrost hydrates exploration. © ASCE.",,"Computer simulation; Freezing; Gas hydrates; Ice; Methane; Permafrost; Sand; Sediments; Frozen rock; Hydrates exploration; Rock mechanics; frozen ground; gas hydrate; hydrocarbon exploration; ice mechanics; permafrost; Alaska; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642537487

It contains the nickel porphyrinoid F430 as prosthetic group which has to be in the Ni(I) oxidation state for the enzyme to be active. The active enzyme exhibits an axial Ni(I)-derived EPR signal MCR-red1. We report here on experiments with methyl-coenzyme M analogues showing how they affect the activity and the MCR-red1 signal of MCR from Methanothermobacter marburgensis. Ethyl-coenzyme M was the only methyl-coenzyme M analogue tested that was used by MCR as a substrate. Ethyl-coenzyme M was reduced to ethane (apparent KM = 20 mM; apparent Vmax = 0.1 U/mg) with a catalytic efficiency of less than 1% of that of methyl-coenzyme M reduction to methane (apparent KM = 5 mM; apparent Vmax = 30 U/mg). Propyl-coenzyme M (apparent Ki = 2 mM) and allyl-coenzyme M (apparent Ki = 0.1 mM) were reversible inhibitors. 2-Bromoethanesulfonate ([I]0.5 V = 2 μM), cyano-coenzyme ([I]0.5 V= 0.2 mM), 3-bromopropionate ([I]0.5 V = 3 mM), seleno-coenzyme M ([I] 0.5 V = 6 mM) and trifluoromethyl-coenzyme M ([I]0.5 V = 6 mM) irreversibly inhibited the enzyme. In their presence the MRC-red1 signal was quenched, indicating the oxidation of Ni(I) to Ni(II). The rate of oxidation increased over 10-fold in the presence of coenzyme B, indicating that the Ni(I) reactivity was increased in the presence of coenzyme B. Enzyme inactivated in the presence of coenzyme B showed an isotropic signal characteristic of a radical that is spin coupled with one hydrogen nucleus. The coupling was also observed in D2O. The signal was abolished upon exposure of the enzyme to O2. 3-Bromopropanesulfonate ([I]0.5 V = 0.1 μM), 3-iodopropanesulfonate ([I]0.5 V = 1 μM), and 4-bromobutyrate also inactivated MCR. In their presence the EPR signal of MCR-red1 was converted into a Ni-based EPR signal MCR-BPS that resembles in line shape the MCR-ox1 signal. The signal was quenched by O2. 2-Bromoethanesulfonate and 3-bromopropanesulfonate, which both rapidly reacted with Ni(I) of MRC-red1, did not react with the Ni of MCR-ox1 and MCR-BPS. The Ni-based EPR spectra of both inactive forms were not affected in the presence of high concentrations of these two potent inhibitors.","EPR spectroscopy; Factor 430; Methanogenic archaea; Methyl-coenzyme M reductase; Nickel enzymes","methyl coenzyme m reductase; nickel; oxidoreductase; unclassified drug; article; catalysis; electron spin resonance; enzyme active site; enzyme inactivation; enzyme substrate; Methanobacterium; Methanothermobacter marburgensis; oxidation; priority journal; Alkanesulfonic Acids; Binding Sites; Kinetics; Mesna; Methanobacteriaceae; Models, Chemical; Molecular Structure; Nickel; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidoreductases; Substrate Specificity; Archaea; Methanobacterium; Methanothermobacter; Methanothermobacter marburgensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644265740

The overbank deposits exhibit a more positive range of δ13C values (-26.3 ± 0.6) than contemporary suspended sediment in transport at intermediate flows (-27.8 ± 0.2) when gully erosion releases most material to stream channels, reflecting the greater contribution made by shallow landsliding in the headwaters during large precipitation events. Overbank sediment associated with recent floods contains a higher (∼50%) amount of organic carbon than alluvium deposited by pre-1927 floods, which was derived from outcrops of weathered bedrock on steep, riparian hillslopes that were the primary sediment source before the soil-mantled hillslopes elsewhere in the headwaters of the basin were destabilized by deforestation. The recent alluvium resembles the Bw horizon of soils present on these hillslopes. Sediment deposited during floods generated by localized storms and an overbank event that did not feature widespread shallow landsliding also has a distinctive signature that provides an indication of its provenance. The organic carbon associated with the alluvium appears to be old (4031 ± 40 B.P., in the case of the carbon associated with sediment deposited in 2002) and to be derived from weathered Cretaceous and Tertiary sedimentary rocks. © 2004 by the American Geophysical Union.","Carbon; Floodplain alluvium; Sediment sources",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85047503256

The balance between these two functions may be sensitive to both natural and anthropogenically induced variability, yet these effects have not been thoroughly evaluated in mangrove ecosystems. We determine organic matter sources and carbon burial rates over the past 160 years in three lagoons on the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico. Carbon isotopes and C/N elemental ratios are utilized to trace the three sources contributing to sedimentary organic matter, mangroves, seagrasses and phytoplankton, while nitrogen isotopes are used to elucidate potential post-depositional biogeochemical transformations in mangrove lagoon sediments. All three organic matter sources contribute to organic carbon burial. Phytoplankton and mangroves are the dominant sources of organic matter in lagoon bank sediments and seagrasses are a significant source to central lagoon sediments. Organic carbon burial rates are higher at the lagoon fringes, where mangrove vegetation dominates, than in seagrass-dominated mid-lagoon areas. A reduction in mangrove contribution to the sedimentary organic matter pool concurrent with reduced total organic carbon burial rates is observed in the recent past at all three lagoons studied. Natural cycles in sediment organic matter source over the past 160 years are observed in a high-resolution core. These fluctuations correspond to climatic variability in this region, as recorded in deep-sea foraminiferal assemblages. Additional work is required in order to differentiate between recent anthropogenic perturbations and natural variability in organic carbon sources and burial rates within these ecosystems. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope record and accelerator mass spectrometry (AMS) 14C data provide the basis for the core age chronology. Planktonic and benthic foraminiferal δ18O and δ13C measurements, magnetic susceptibility, ice rafted debris and coarse fraction content, carbonate and organic carbon content, and diatom and pollen spectra show major changes in regional climate, sea surface conditions, ice extent and sedimentary regime, which are correlated with the global glacial-interglacial changes of marine isotope stages (MIS) 1 through 5.3. Regional cooling and intensification of winter sea ice formation during the last glaciation increased the northern shelf surface water density and Sea of Okhotsk Intermediate Water (SOIW) formation. In addition to major Milankovitch-scale changes, lithological, geochemical and paleontological indices also show suborbital oscillations in Okhotsk Sea hydrology, sedimentation and regional climate. These shorter-term oscillations are characterized by coupled maxima in ice rafted debris and sediment coarse fraction (lithodynamic indices, LDI) values and most are associated with cold events involving enhanced winter ice formation and intensification of SOIW and North Pacific intermediate water (NPIW) formation. The terminations of LDI maxima were induced by climate warming and reductions in ice formation, and were accompanied by sharp decreases in planktonic foraminiferal δ 18O. During the glacial terminations of MIS 2 and 4, however, the onset of suborbital-scale LDI maxima occurs close to sharp negative δ18O shifts in planktonic foraminifera (δ 18Opf) associated with climate warming. In these special cases, the LDI maxima occurred under warm climate and rising sea levels and did not lead to increases in SOIW or NPIW ventilation. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

We have determined the amino acid sequence of 6PGD of Bactrocera oleae and constructed a three-dimensional model based on the homologous known sheep structure. In a comparative study of 6PGD sequences from numerous species, all the conserved and variable regions of the enzyme were analyzed and the regions of functional importance were localized, in an attempt promoted also by the direct involvement of the enzyme in various human diseases. Thus, analysis of amino acid variability of 37 6PGD sequences revealed that all regions important for the catalytic activity, such as those forming the substrate and coenzyme binding sites, are highly conserved in all species examined. Moreover, several amino acid residues responsible for substrate and coenzyme specificity were also found to be identical in all species examined. The higher percentage of protein divergence is observed at two regions that accumulate mutations, located at the distant parts of the two domains of the enzyme with respect to their interface. These peripheral regions of nonfunctional importance are highly variable and are predicted as antigenic, thus reflecting possible regions for antibody recognition. Furthermore, locating the differences between diptera 6PGD sequences on the three-dimensional model suggests probable positions of different amino acid residues appearing at B. oleae fast, intermediate, and slow allozymic variants.","6-Phosphogluconate dehydrogenase gene; Functional constraints; Insects; Mammals; Structure","phosphogluconate dehydrogenase; amino acid analysis; article; Bactrocera oleae; controlled study; decarboxylation; Drosophila; enzyme degradation; gene sequence; gene structure; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; oxidative phosphorylation; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Binding Sites; Cloning, Molecular; Conserved Sequence; DNA Primers; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphogluconate Dehydrogenase; Protein Conformation; Sequence Alignment; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Tephritidae; Arachnida; Bactrocera oleae; Diptera; Hexapoda; Mammalia; Ovis aries",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344628170

To elucidate and understand the anatomy of the C4 ppcA1 promoter, detailed promoter/reporter gene studies were performed in the closely related C4 species F. bidentis, revealing that the C 4 promoter contains two regions, a proximal segment up to -570 and a distal part from -1566 to -2141, which are necessary but also sufficient for high mesophyll-specific expression of the β-glucuronidase reporter gene.

London, Charing Cross C., London, United Kingdom","Axonal pathology is increasingly identified by β-amyloid precursor protein (βAPP) immunohistochemistry in the brains of patients who may or may not have a history of trauma. The presence of βAPP-IR+ has been variously interpreted as either that diffuse traumatic axonal injury (TAI) is indeed a universal finding in cases of fatal traumatic brain injury (TBI) or there are other causes of βAPP-IR+ axons which under certain circumstances may be sufficient to mimic TBI and therefore make the medico-legal interpretation of certain cases very difficult. To address some of the uncertainties we have undertaken a detailed analysis of the amount and distribution of βAPP immunohistochemistry in 63 cases of fatal TBI, 17 cases of patients dying after cardiac arrest, 12 cases dying in association with status epilepticus, 3 cases of carbon monoxide (CO) poisoning, 13 cases of hypoglycaemia and in 60 controls. Three patterns of βAPP-IR+ were identified. First, diffuse multi-focal, second, corresponding to the outline of an infarct or haematoma, and thirdly a mixture of the two. The first pattern was seen in cases of the lesser grades of TAI, CO poisoning, and hypoglycaemia, the second pattern in cases in which there was evidence of raised intracranial pressure and the third in cases of severe TAI. It is concluded that the proper interpretation of cases requires the examination of a sufficient number of blocks (n=15), processing using standardised protocols including βAPP immunohistochemistry and in some cases the mapping of any IR + on anatomical line diagrams. βAPP carried out on a small number of randomly taken blocks is likely to lead to misinterpretation of the clinico-pathological correlations and possibly to a miscarriage of justice. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

It is estimated that 731 thermoelectric units, larger than 100 MWe, are operating nowadays, and their total installed capacity equals to 200.7 GWe. Coal contribution to the total electricity generation with reference to other fuel sources, is by far more intensive in the non-EU part (EU member candidate states , compared to the EU member states. It is expected that even after the enlargement, the European Union will strongly being related to coal. Enlargement will bring additional factors into play in order to meet the requirements of rising consumption, growing demand for conventional fuels and increasing dependence on imports. Besides the technology, boiler size, efficiency, age and environmental performance will determine the necessities of the coal-fired power sector in each country. Depending on the case, lifetime extension measures in operating coal-fired power plants or clean coal technologies can play an important role towards the energy sector restructuring. Low efficiency values in the non-EU coal-fired units and heavily aged power plants in EU countries will certainly affect decisions in favour of upgrading or reconstruction. The overall increase of efficiency, the reduction of harmful emissions from generating processes and the co-combustion of coal with biomass and wastes for generating purposes indicate that coal can be cleaner and more efficient. Additionally, plenty of rehabilitation projects based on CCT applications, have already been carried out or are under progress in the EU energy sector. The proclamations of the countries' energy policies in the coming decades, includes integrated renovation concepts of the coal-fired power sector. Further to the natural gas penetration in the electricity generation and CO2 sequestration and underground storage, the implementation of CCT projects will strongly contribute to the reduction of CO2 emissions in the European Union, according to the targets set in the Kyoto protocol. In consequence, clean coal technologies can open up new markets not only in the EU member candidate states, but also in other parts of the world. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Clean coal technologies; CO2 reduction; Electricity generation; Rehabilitation","Coal; Electric power plants; Performance; Strategic planning; Energy production; Thermoelectric units; Electric power generation; cleaner production; coal-fired power plant; electricity generation; European Union; regionalization; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142714568

Conversion of cultivated land to permanent grassland would result in the greatest reduction in N 2O emissions, particularly in eastern Canada where the model estimated about 60% less N 2O emissions for this conversion. About 33% less N 2O emissions were predicted for a change from conventional tillage to no-tillage in western Canada, however, a slight increase in N 2O emissions was predicted for eastern Canada. Greater N 2O emissions in eastern Canada associated with the adoption of no-tillage were attributed to higher soil moisture causing denitrification, whereas the lower emissions in western Canada were attributed to less decomposition of soil organic matter in no-till versus conventional tilled soil. Elimination of summer fallow in a crop rotation resulted in a 9% decrease in N 2O emissions, with substantial emissions occurring during the wetter fallow years when N had accumulated. Increasing N-fertilizer application rates by 50% increased average emissions by 32%, while a 50% decrease of N-fertilizer application decreased emissions by 16%. In general, a small increase in N 2O emissions was predicted when N-fertilizer was applied in the fall rather than in the spring. Previous research on CO 2 emissions with the CENTURY model (Smith et al., 2001) allowed the quantification of the combined change in N 2O and CO 2 emissions in CO 2 equivalents for a wide range of management practices in the seven major soil regions in Canada. The management practices that have the greatest potential to reduce the combined N 2O and CO 2 emissions are conversion from conventional tillage to permanent grassland, reduced tillage, and reduction of summer fallow. The estimated net greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction when changing from cultivated land to permanent grassland ranged from 0.97 (Brown Chernozem) to 4.24 Mg CO 2 equiv. ha -1 y -1 (Black Chernozem) for the seven soil regions examined. When changing from conventional tillage to no-tillage the net GHG emission reduction ranged from 0.33 (Brown Chernozem) to 0.80 Mg CO 2 equiv. ha -1 y -1 (Dark Gray Luvisol). Elimination of fallow in the crop rotation lead to an estimated net GHG emission reduction of 0.43 (Brown Chernozem) to 0.80 Mg CO 2 equiv. ha -1 y -1 (Dark Brown Chernozem). The addition of 50% more or 50% less N-fertilizer both resulted in slight increases in combined CO 2 and N 2O emissions. There was a tradeoff in GHG flux with greater N 2O emissions and a comparable increase in carbon storage when 50% more N-fertilizer was added. The results from this work indicate that conversion of cultivated land to grassland, the conversion from conventional tillage to no-tillage, and the reduction of summerallow in crop rotations could substantially increase C sequestration and decrease net GHG emissions. Based on these results a simple scaling-up scenario to derive the possible impacts on Canada's Kyoto commitment has been calculated.",,"Grassland; Soil moisture; Denitrification; Environmental protection; Industrial emissions; Mathematical models; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Particulate emissions; Soils; Climate change; agricultural practice; carbon dioxide; emission control; land use change; nitrogen dioxide; soil emission; soil management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444342222

The technique is based on the chemical transduction method, Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer, FRET, which requires the utilization of special molecular groups (donor and acceptor fluorophores), whose combined purpose is to fluoresce in the presence of a given analyte when subjected to an external photon source. The donor and acceptor fluorophores were covalently attached at either ends of peptide constructs that were synthesized using Fmoc (9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl) strategy, a method for solid-phase synthesis of peptides. Three different peptide substrates were synthesized, two positive constructs which were cleaved by the enzyme, thrombin, and one negative construct. The constructs were exposed to thrombin and the response times were determined as well as the effects of the enzyme concentration and pH. The results showed that when the peptide constructs were exposed to thrombin at a pH of 7.4 and 8.3, the positive constructs were cleaved, separating the distance between the two fluorophores, resulting in detectable changes in fluorescence. The higher pH value resulted in faster reaction rates. The peptide constructs demonstrated a limit of detection of 0.02 Units/ml with a 90% steady state value (τ 90) response time within 2 minutes.

An important component is improvement of quality assurance procedures for hourly meteorological data. This paper presents the development and testing of two components of a new complex framework, as well as their application toward construction, for the first time, of a 75-yr time series of apparent temperature. A pilot study indicated that a majority of flags thrown from an existing algorithm represent single-hour blips, rather than steps, and that frontal passages were being flagged incorrectly. Therefore, a model focused on flagging blips is developed; two blip-magnitude measures are compared that define a blip as a departure from temporally neighboring observations. Switches of dewpoint with dewpoint depression have also been noted among observer/digitizer errors, and so an additional check was developed to screen for these cases. This check is based on a relationship between dewpoint depression and diurnal temperature range. Tests using artificial replication of common errors indicate that the new blip model outperforms traditional step models considerably, and the new model flags an order-of-magnitude fewer frontal passages. Operational use of this check suggests type-I and type-II error rates are similar in magnitude and are approximately 5%. More than two-fifths of known dewpoint depression switch errors are caught. However, poor performance with systematic errors suggests that using the depression-range check at a coarser temporal scale than hour to hour may be more fruitful. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Algorithms; Atmospheric humidity; Climate change; Database systems; Error analysis; Quality assurance; Time series analysis; Blip model; Digitizer errors; Diurnal temperature; Temperature range; Environmental impact; accuracy assessment; algorithm; climate modeling; error analysis; humidity; synoptic meteorology; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444234266

Almost all known CME-associated phenomena were observed during this event, i.e., a filament eruption, solar flare, dimmings, and a post-eruptive arcade formation. Following a chain of events observed in various spectral ranges, we find that the event occurred in an activity complex consisting of active regions 9231 and 9238, and that it was triggered by a magnetic flux emergence, which caused a flare in AR 9231. In turn, the flare triggered activation and eruption of the filament followed by the CME and the flare in AR 9238 in which the post-eruptive arcade was observed. We discuss some characteristics of the flare and CME and also estimate the magnetic field strength in the coronal arcade to be about 200 G from spatially resolved polarization measurements in microwaves with radio telescopes. In this particular case, the only significant emission mechanism is optically thin free-free emission, and the possible contribution of nonthermal emissions cannot change our estimate of the magnetic field strength in the corona. However, generally one should make sure that the nonthermal contribution cannot be important in similar cases; otherwise, the magnetic field can be well overestimated. Here, we specifically address the identification technique of the radio emission mechanism. © Springer 2005.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-17444418304

The goal is to gain understanding into the fluid dynamics and thermodynamics of the plume to ultimately improve SWNT production techniques. The simulations were carried out with a 12-species, 14-reaction chemistry model that included carbon species from C to C 6. Metal catalysts in the carbon target were ignored for these simulations. Simulation times ranged from immediate ablation onset to 8 ms past the initial onset of ablation. A secondary goal of the study was to compare computational results with experimental results for three different background gases in the laser ablation oven - argon, helium, and nitrogen. Computational results indicated that lighter carbon species were more quickly diffused into the background gas for helium and nitrogen, resulting in lower localized mass fractions of carbon nanotube ""feedstock."" The expectation is that this effect will reduce the production of carbon nanotubes, which has been confirmed by experimental evidence.

This paper tests whether the 1970 Clean Air Act and its subsequent amendments caused this decline. The centerpiece of this legislation is the annual assignment of all counties to SO2 nonattainment or attainment categories. Polluters face stricter regulations in nonattainment counties. There are two primary findings. First, regulators pay little attention to the statutory selection rule in their assignment of the SO2 nonattainment designations. Second, SO2 nonattainment status is associated with modest reductions in SO2 air pollution, but a null hypothesis of zero effect generally cannot be rejected. This finding holds whether the estimated effect is obtained with linear adjustment or propensity score matching. Overall, the evidence suggests that the nonattainment designation played a minor role in the dramatic reduction of SO2 concentrations over the last 30 years. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

We tested the feasibility of this approach to detect functional differences in microbial communities utilising recently fixed plant photosynthate in moisture perturbed grassland turfs. Specifically, we addressed two questions: (1) How does moisture perturbation (three treatments; continual wetting, drying, and drying followed by rewetting) affect the assimilation of 13C-labelled exudates carbon into the soil microbial community?; (2) Can 13C deposited in soil from pulse-labelled plants be used to identify microbes utilising plant exudates using SIP methodologies? Net CO2 fluxes showed that prior to 13CO2 pulse labelling, all treatments were photosynthetically active, but differences were observed in night time respiration, indicating moisture treatments had impacted on net CO2 efflux. Measurements of pulse-derived 13C incorporated into soil RNA over 2 months showed that there was only evidence of 13C enrichment in the continuously wetted treatments. However, isotopic values represented only a 0.1-0.2 13C at.% increase over natural abundance levels and were found to be insufficient for the application of RNA-SIP. These findings reveal that in this experimental system, the microbial uptake of labelled carbon from plant exudates is low, and further optimisation of methodologies may be required for application of SIP to natural plant-soil systems where 13C tracer dilution is a consideration. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Fuel cell technology is expected to help reduce primary energy demand and emissions of limited and climate-relevant pollutants. The high flexibility of fuel cell systems with respect to energy carriers opens up possibilities of modifying the energy sector in the long term. Introducing new fuels based on low-carbon, or in the long term carbon-free, energy carriers can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions as well as locally and regionally active atmospheric pollutants. The use of hydrogen as feed gas for fuel cells on the basis of it being a non-fossil, renewable energy, leads to special benefits with respect to conserving resources and climate protection, but at present still represents a medium- to long-term prospect. A major milestone on the road to market success for all energy conversion systems with fuel cells is the reduction of costs. The definition of the ""appropriate"" fuel represents a serious obstacle to the market introduction of fuel-cell-powered vehicles.

This process was investigated in conjunction with other phenomena occurring in melted filler metals. The nitrogen absorption by arc-melted Fe-C-Mn-type filler metals has been described by the first-order kinetic expression, dividing the total surface area of the melted specimen by the region of the electric arc interaction and the region contacting with the cooler shielding gas. Based on this model, the time-dependent changes of nitrogen content were determined, as well as the mass transfer coefficients β and the rates of the nitrogen absorption in various melting conditions. It has been shown that the conditions of nitrogen absorption by arc-melted Fe-C-Mn-type filler metals differ much from the mechanism suggested for pure Fe and solutions in the Fe-O system. The carbon deoxidation reaction running at high temperatures is a factor limiting the nitrogen absorption by arc melted Fe-C-Mn-type filler metals. An increase of the nitrogen absorption rate and nitrogen content as a result of decreased melting current correlated with the reduction of carbon deoxidation and manganese evaporation, as well as with the formation of liquid oxides that reduce nitrogen desorption from the areas not subjected to the arc interaction.","Absorption; Arc Melting; Filler Metal; Kinetics; Model; Nitrogen; Oxygen","Desorption; Gas absorption; Iron alloys; Metallurgy; Nitrogen; Oxidation; Reaction kinetics; Steelmaking; Thermodynamics; Arc melting; Carbon deoxidation; Filler metals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942472503

The problem is particularly important for ground level ozone which forms kilometres away, hours later from the emission of its precursors. To approach this problem, a method (1) to identify local pollutant-precursor models on the basis of results from a large photochemical model (CALGRID), (2) to integrate them in a multi-objective mathematical program, together with an estimate of the emission reduction costs, is suggested.

Unfortunately, how much water is required and how much water is actually being used for irrigation in Georgia is primarily estimated and largely unknown. The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model in simulating crop yield and irrigation demand for three major crops in Georgia. Model evaluation is necessary to provide credibility in applying the model for simulating water use by agriculture. Seasonal yield and irrigation data for the 1990 through 2001 crop variety trials conducted at five agricultural experiment stations were used to evaluate simulation of yield and irrigation amount. The root mean squared deviation (RMSD) for yield was 0.29 t/ha for cotton, 0.39 t/ha for soybean, and 1.02 t/ha for peanut. The RMSD for peanut was large because the model tended to underestimate high yields and was not as sensitive to the factors responsible for the year-to-year variability of peanut yield. The RMSD for total amount of irrigation was 75 mm for cotton, 83 mm for soybean, and 87 mm for peanut. The model simulated the mean irrigation amount and the magnitude of annual variability very well. The component of mean squared deviation (MSD = RMSD 2) related to the pattern of annual variability in irrigation amount contributed most to MSD. Overall, the results showed that the EPIC model can be a useful tool for simulating crop yield and irrigation demand at a field level. Future efforts will focus on using the model for regional estimation of water use for irrigation in Georgia and other southeastern states. © 2004 American Society of Agricultural Engineers.","Cotton; Decision support system; EPIC model; Irrigation; Peanut; Simulation models; Soybean; Water use","Computer simulation; Environmental protection; Irrigation; Mathematical models; Water resources; Crop yield; Environmental policy integrated climate (EPIC) models; Root mean square deviation (RMSD); Crops; crop yield; decision support system; irrigation; modeling; water demand; Farm Crops; Irrigation; Mathematical Models; Simulation; Water Resources; Georgia; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14844293215

Based on evidence from staff climate surveys and case studies, it is clear that high turnover schools face significant organizational challenges. Schools with high teacher turnover rates have difficulty planning and implementing a coherent curriculum and sustaining positive working relationships among teachers. The reality of these organizational challenges is particularly alarming, given that high turnover schools are more likely to serve low-income and minority students. The negative relationship between teacher turnover and school functioning, and the fact that turbulent schools are disproportionately likely to serve low-income and minority students have important implications for both district and school-level policies. Specifically: 1. Teacher turnover rates are one indicator of school health, which school districts should consider when focusing on school improvements. Districts need to begin by developing the means to identify individual schools that experience high levels of teacher turnover. 2. Current district policies in implementing professional development for teachers in low-performing schools are inefficient when teachers do not remain in the schools in which they are trained. 3. In order for low-performing schools to improve, districts need to consider providing incentive programs so that high quality teachers apply for, and remain in, these schools. Future research is needed to address the causal link between turnover, organizational functioning and student outcomes. Additionally, there is a need for research examining district policies that may facilitate teacher turnover within a district, including how districts place and transfer teachers, as well as how teachers' salaries are budgeted.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644305733

It was designed as a cross-sectional study based on data from visitors at a clinic at Trnava University located in Mukuru slum in Nairobi. There were about 16,000 visits registered at Mary Immaculate Clinic of Trnava University in Nairobi during 2 years of operation. A random 5% sample was drawn from the paper-card database of this clinic to assess basic characteristics and health complaints of visitors. Both self-reported health complaints and diagnoses written by physicians were used to assess health status of participants. More females with average age (by slum) ranging from 20.46 to 21.30 years than males with average age ranging from (by slum) 15.86 to 19.49 years are the visitors of the clinic. The major self-reported health complaints of visitors were cough, abdominal pain, and headache for both sexes. The most frequent diagnoses were consequently virosis, acute respiratory infections, and bronchitis. Differences in health complaints by slums were observed and are described herein. The major health complaints and diagnoses in addition to the differences in health complaints and diagnoses by slum show that environmental conditions can have major influences on health status. Therefore, environmental improvements are important in the improvement of health status. A very high prevalence of respiratory complaints and gastrointestinal problems signify that improvements in air pollution reduction, drinking water provision, and waste management in slums can lead to more significant and sustainable improvements in health status than just simple treatment. This fact should be taken into account when planning future relief programs. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The highest rates of atmospheric CH4 consumption occurred in the upper 5 cm mineral soil of the control plots. In contrast to the results of several previous studies, surface organic soils in the control plots also exhibited high consumption rates. Fertilization decreased in situ CH4 consumption in the pine and hardwood sites relative to the control plots by 86% and 49%, respectively. Fertilization increased net N mineralization and relative nitrification rates and decreased CH4 uptake most dramatically in the organic horizon, which contributed substantially to the overall decrease in field flux rates. In all cases, CH4 oxidation followed Michaelis-Menten kinetics, with apparent Km (Km(app)) values typical of high-affinity soil CH4 oxidizers. Both K m(app) and Vmax(app) were significantly lower in fertilized soils than in unfertilized soils. The physiology of the methane consumer community in the fertilized soils was distinct from short-term responses to NH4+ addition. Whereas the immediate response to NH4+ was an increase in Km(app), resulting from apparent enzymatic substrate competition, the long-term response to fertilization was a community-level shift to a lower Km(app), a possible adaptation to diminish the competitiveness of NH4 + for enzyme active sites. © 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

The Kyoto Protocol requires that Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) projects result in long-term benefits related to the mitigation of climate change. This long-term requirement to keep carbon in storage may conflict with the short-term needs of the poor. The objective of this paper is to examine the potential implications of the Land use change and forestry (LUCF) projects to the rural livelihoods in India. For this purpose the paper uses a linearised version of the almost ideal demand system (LA-AIDS) to analyse data collected from 69206 rural households in India. Based on the analysis, the paper concludes that for CDM to be sustainable and result in sustainable development of the local people, three important criteria should be satisfied: (1) Integrating the energy substitution possibilities in the objectives of carbon sequestration; (2) Management of the CPR lands by the rural poor through proper design of the rules for sustenance of user groups; and (3) Ensuring that the maximum revenue from carbon sequestration is channelled to the rural poor. Otherwise CDM would just result in either leakage of carbon benefits or have negative welfare implications for the poor. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This study used SEEDSCAPE, a recently modified gap model designed for cultivated land mosaics in the Great Plains, to simulate the effects of climate change on the dynamics of such linear forests. We simulated the dynamics of windbreaks with different initial planting species richness and widths (light changes as the selected resulting factor) using current climate data and nested regional circulation models (RegCMs). Results indicated that (i) it took 70-80 simulation years for the linear forests to reach a steady state under both normal (present-day) and warming climates; (ii) warming climates would reduce total aboveground tree biomass and the spatial variation in biomass, but increase dominance in the linear forests, especially in the upland forests; (iii) linear forests with higher planting species richness and smaller width produced higher aboveground tree biomass per unit area; and (iv) the same species performed very differently with different climate scenarios, initial planting diversity, and forest widths. Although the model still needs further improvements (e.g., the effects of understory species should be included), the model can serve as a useful tool in modeling the succession of linear forests in human-dominated land mosaics under changing climates and may also have significant practical implications in other systems. © 2004 NRC Canada.",,"Biodiversity; Biomass; Climate change; Climatology; Computer simulation; Cultivation; Ecology; Agroecosystems; Linear forests; Mosaics; Regional circulation models (RegCM); Spatial variations; Forestry; forest dynamics; growth modeling; habitat mosaic; species diversity; succession; Biodiversity; Biomass; Cultivation; Ecology; Forestry; Meteorology; Simulation; Great Plains; North America; Western Hemisphere; World; Riparia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-15944425068

Results indicate that the model generally reproduces observed distributions of Rn but there are some biases in the model related to differences in large-scale and convective transport. Simulations presented here use an off-line three-dimensional chemical transport model driven by assimilated winds and two scenarios of Rn fluxes (atom cm-2 s-1) from ice-free land surfaces: (A) globally uniform flux of 1.0 within ±60and 0.5 within 60Ν -70Ν and (B) uniform flux of 1.0 between 60Σ and 30Ν followed by a sharp linear decrease to 0.2 at 70Ν. We considered an additional scenario (C) where Rn emissions for case A were uniformly reduced by 28%. Results show that case A overpredicts observed Rn distributions in both hemispheres. Simulated Northern Hemisphere Rn distributions from cases B and C compare better with the observations, but are not discernible from each other. In the Southern Hemisphere, surface Rn distributions from case C compare better with the observations. We performed a synoptic-scale sourcereceptor analysis for surface Rn to locate regions with ratios B/A and B/C less than 0.5. Considering the maximum uncertainty in regional Rn emissions of a factor of 2, our analysis indicates that additional measurements of surface Rn, particularly during April-October and north of 50Ν over the Pacific as well as Atlantic regions, would make it possible to determine if the proposed latitude gradient in Rn emissions is superior to a uniform flux scenario.

It appears that SO 2 and total suspended particles (TSP) are largely emitted by thermal power plants (∼68% and ∼80%, respectively), while the transport sector contributes most to NO x, CO and non-methane volatile organic compound (NMVOC) emissions (&gt;80%). Further, while CO 2 has been largely emitted by power plants in the past (about 60% in 1990, and 48% in 2000), the contribution by the transport sector is increasing (27% in 1990 and 39% in 2000). NH 3 and N 2O are largely emitted from agriculture (∼70% and ∼50%, respectively), and solid waste disposal is the main source of CH 4 (∼80%). In the past TSP abatement to improve air quality has largely focused on traffic emissions; however, our results suggest that it would be most efficient to also reduce TSP emissions by power plants. We also assessed the potential large-scale transport of the Delhi emissions based on 10-day forward trajectory calculations. The relatively strong growth of NO x emissions indicates that photochemical O 3 formation in the regional environment may be increasing substantially, in particular in the dry season. During the summer, on the other hand, convective mixing of air pollutants may reduce regional but increase large-scale, i.e. hemispheric effects. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A small percentage of SF6 strongly reduces the streamer size, increasing the RPC rate capability. The UV photons involved in the streamer process are also decreased, allowing their absorbtion with an isobutane percentage well below the flammability limit. Besides the streamer reduction, the SF6 increases the size of the avalanche signal preceeding the streamer. By exploiting the relatively large amplitude of the prompt precursor, a time resolution of about 1 ns (r.m.s.) has been obtained over the whole full efficiency region.

Moreover, rather than claiming that landscape architecture needs simplicity to be successful, it would be of great interest for the future to promote design concepts in which complexity plays a role.

The FUSE instrument resolves the rotational structure of the H2 spectra and the spectral range allows the study of self-absorption. Below 1100 Å, transitions connecting to the v ″ ≤ 2 levels of the H2 ground state are partially or totally absorbed by the overlying H2 molecules. The FUSE spectra provide information on the overlying H2 column and on the vibrational distribution of H2. Transitions from high-energy H2 Rydberg states and treatment of self-absorption are considered in our synthetic spectral generator. We show comparisons between synthetic and observed spectra in the 920-970, 1030-1080, and 1090-1180 Å spectral windows. In a first approach (single-layer model), the synthetic spectra are generated in a thin emitting layer and the emerging photons are absorbed by a layer located above the source. It is found that the parameters of the single-layer model best fitting the three spectral windows are 850, 800, and 800 K respectively for the H2 gas temperature and 1.3 × 1018, 1.5 × 1020, and 1.3 × 1020 cm-2 for the H2 self-absorbing vertical column respectively. Comparison between the H2 column and a 1-D atmospheric model indicates that the short-wavelength FUV auroral emission originates from just above the homopause. This is confirmed by the high H2 rovibrational temperatures, close to those deduced from spectral analyses of H+3 auroral emission. In a second approach, the synthetic spectral generator is coupled with a vertically distributed energy degradation model, where the only input is the energy distribution of incoming electrons (multi-layer model). The model that best fits globally the three FUSE spectra is a sum of Maxwellian functions, with characteristic energies ranging from 1 to 100 keV, giving rise to an emission peak located at 5 μbar, that is ∼ 100 km below the methane homopause. This multi-layer model is also applied to a re-analysis of the Hopkins Ultraviolet Telescope (HUT) auroral spectrum and accounts for the H 2 self-absorption as well as the methane absorption. It is found that no additional discrete soft electron precipitation is necessary to fit either the FUSE or the HUT observations. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

This is based on food consumption statistics, and the specific energy for food cooking. Estimated biofuel consumption in India was 379 (247-584) Tg yr-1. New information on the user population of different biofuels was compiled at a state level, to derive the biofuel mix, which varied regionally and was 74:16:10%, respectively, of fuelwood, dung cake and crop waste, at a national level. Importantly, the uncertainty in biofuel use from quantitative error assessment using the new methodology is around 50%, giving a narrower bound than in previous works. From this new activity data and currently used black carbon emission factors, the black carbon (BC) emissions from biofuel combustion were estimated as 220 (65-760) Gg yr-1. The largest BC emissions were from fuelwood (75%), with lower contributions from dung cake (16%) and crop waste (9%). The uncertainty of 245% in the BC emissions estimate is now governed by the large spread in BC emission factors from biofuel combustion (122%), implying the need for reducing this uncertainty through measurements. Emission factors of SO 2 from combustion of biofuels widely used in India were measured, and ranged 0.03-0.08 g kg-1 from combustion of two wood species, 0.05-0.20 g kg-1 from 10 crop waste types, and 0.88 g kg-1 from dung cake, significantly lower than currently used emission factors for wood and crop waste. Estimated SO 2 emissions from biofuels of 75 (36-160) Gg yr -1 were about a factor of 3 lower than that in recent studies, with a large contribution from dung cake (73%), followed by fuelwood (21%) and crop waste (6%).

To understand the role of AHR genetic variability in differential sensitivity to HAHs and PAHs, we are currently studying a population of the teleost Fundulus heteroclitus (Atlantic killifish) that has evolved genetic resistance to the toxic and biochemical effects of these compounds. Here, we report that the killifish AHR1 locus is highly polymorphic and that the frequencies of the major allele types differ between dioxin-sensitive and dioxin-resistant populations. Twenty-five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), nine of which are non-synonymous, were identified in the AHR1 coding sequence. Seven identified alleles were assigned to three groups, designated AHR1*1, AHR1*2 and AHR1*3. AHR1*1 alleles were under-represented in a population of dioxin-and polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB)-reslstant fish from a PCB-contaminated Superfund site (New Bedford Harbor, Massachusetts, USA) compared to dioxin-sensitive fish from a less contaminated reference site (Scorton Creek, Massachusetts, USA). To determine the possible role of these AHR1 variants in differential HAH sensitivity, we expressed representative variant proteins from the two most divergent allelic groups (AHR1*1 and AHR1*3) by in-vitro transcription and translation and assessed their functional properties. AHR1*1A and AHR1*3A proteins displayed similar binding capacities and affinities for [3H]TCDD. In transient transfection assays using mammalian cells, AHR1*1A and AHR1*3A exhibited similar abilities to support TCDD-dependent transactivation of a luciferase reporter gene under control of AHR-responsive enhancer elements. We discuss the possibility of other functional differences in AHR1 variants or their interaction with other killifish loci (AHR2, AHRR) that may contribute to differences in dioxin sensitivity. © 2004 Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins.","Aryl hydrocarbon receptor; Dioxin; Polychlorinated biphenyl; Polymorphism","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; allele; article; binding affinity; controlled study; fish; gene activation; gene expression; gene identification; genetic polymorphism; genetic transcription; genetic transfection; genetic variability; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; Animals; Base Sequence; CHO Cells; Cricetinae; Drug Resistance; Drug Tolerance; Environmental Pollutants; Fundulidae; Gene Frequency; Luciferases; Massachusetts; Molecular Sequence Data; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Polymorphism, Genetic; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA, Messenger; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin; Trans-Activation (Genetics); Transcription, Genetic; Fundulus; Fundulus heteroclitus; Mammalia; Staphylococcus phage 3A; Teleostei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1342309265

Variations in the percentages of conifer and Artemisia (sagebrush) pollen at Grass Lake recorded shifts in vegetation that reflect changes in precipitation. Between 36 and 34 cal ka, a progression from steppe to open pine forest to dense pine forest indicates that precipitation increased. After 32 cal ka, the forest became more open and by 30 cal ka sagebrush steppe surrounded the lake, implying that precipitation decreased. The area was arid for most of the interval between 30 and 19 cal ka. Increases in conifer pollen recorded increases in precipitation from 21 through 19 cal ka, when open pine forest colonized the lake area. Throughout the period from 36 to 19 cal ka, centennial- to millennial-scale intervals with increased conifer pollen imply that the arid interval was interrupted by periods of increased precipitation. Pollen data also provide evidence that the major fluctuations in sand concentration in the Grass Lake core reflect temperature shifts. Changes in sediment particle size are closely related to variations in pollen concentration and accumulation rate, which in turn reflect changes in plant cover, implying that sand was deposited in the lake due to deflation of clay- and silt-sized particles from sparsely-vegetated alpine areas of the watershed. Sand deposition increased as climatic cooling led to reductions in the elevation of upper treeline and alpine conditions affected a larger part of the watershed. There is no evidence of glaciation in the basin, but pollen data show the area was above upper treeline during Cold Period III (34-32 cal ka), one of several very cold intervals. Vegetation decreased at about 28 cal ka and remained sparse for at least 9000 years, implying that the climate became cooler and remained cool until after 19 cal ka.

Both absorption and fluorometric studies reveal that α-, β- and γ-CD interact differently with the fluorophore. While PYPY forms 1:1 inclusion complexes with β- and γ-CD as reflected from the presence of isosbestic points in the absorption spectra and isoemissive points in the fluorescence spectra, it does not show similar complexation with α-CD. The emission spectrum of PYPY in aqueous solution shows characteristic dual emission; with a structured band assigned to the pyrene monomer emission and a broad and unstructured one at lower energy assigned to the excimer emission. Addition of β- or γ-CD to the aqueous solution of PYPY modifies the fluorescence spectrum markedly. In β-CD solution, the excimer emission yield is reduced with a concomitant enhancement of the monomer emission while in γ-CD solution the excimer emission increases at the cost of the other band. The differences in photophysical behavior of the fluorophore in different CD environments are explained in the light of different modes of encapsulation of PYPY in CDs with different cavity dimensions. The present study points to the probable location of the probe within the microheterogeneous environment.

Ecological stoichiometry could also predict compositional shifts of grazers over gradients of nutrient and light supply through a mechanism involving (mis)matches between elemental body composition of grazers and plants. This hypothesis is explored here using a suite of two-grazer, one-plant models that incorporate three key components: plant production depends on light and nutrients, nutrient content of plants can vary, and homeostatic grazers can be carbon or nutrient limited. The results from this suite closely resemble the classical resource ratio model describing plant competition for two resources. Here, the models predict shifts of grazer composition along resource supply gradients if species trade off competitive abilities for plant carbon and nutrients. Given this trade-off, superior nutrient competitors should dominate low nutrient environments, and superior carbon competitors should dominate high nutrient environments. At intermediate nutrient supply, species can coexist at a stable equilibrium, or alternative stable states emerge, depending on how grazers impact their resources. These results depend on food web architecture, however. For instance, predators can alter or reduce possibilities for stoichiometry-mediated coexistence of grazers.","Coexistence; Competition; Ecological stoichiometry; Priority effects; Resource ratio; Trade-offs","community composition; competition (ecology); resource availability; stoichiometry; trade-off; animal; article; biodiversity; biological model; biomass; competitive behavior; food chain; metabolism; plant; predation; species difference; Animals; Biodiversity; Biomass; Competitive Behavior; Food Chain; Models, Biological; Plants; Predatory Behavior; Species Specificity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143137508

It is clear, however, that some particles are more bioactive than others. One possible mechanism may involve a modification of antigen-presenting cell function. In this study, 2 forms of asbestos (crocidolite and Libby amphibole) and PM2.5 (an urban particle) were cultured with human alveolar macrophages (HAMs) to determine whether antigen-presenting cell (APC) function was altered. HAMs were exposed to the bioactive particles, asbestos and PM2.5, for 24 hours, then isolated free of extracellular particulates and nonviable cells. Isolated HAMs were then cultured with autologous lymphocytes in an 11-day APC assay using tetanous toxoid as the antigen and the resulting culture supernatants were assayed for lymphocyte-derived cytokines. Asbestos exposure, regardless of type, up-regulated a TH1 lymphocyte-derived cytokine, interferon gamma (IFNγ), and the TH2 lymphocyte-derived cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13). PM2.5 exposure up-regulated all 3 cytokines also. Although cytokine production levels were significantly higher for the treatment compared to control cultures as a group, there was extreme variability in the responses between subjects. In addition, there was no correlation between an individual's cells' response to asbestos verses PM, suggesting that more than one possible mechanism exists for a particle-induced APC effect and individual differential sensitivities to inhaled bioactive particles. This work supports the hypothesis that some inhaled particles can modify immune function by directly affecting APCs thus up-regulating the normal lymphocyte response to antigens in the lung.","IL-13; IL-4; Interferon gamma; Macrophage subpopulations; PM2.5","asbestos; cytokine; gamma interferon; interleukin 13; interleukin 4; tetanus toxoid; antigen presenting cell; article; cell culture; cell function; controlled study; correlation analysis; cytokine production; human; human cell; immune function test; in vitro study; lung alveolus macrophage; lymphocyte; particulate matter; priority journal; supernatant; Th2 cell; upregulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442311068

Using mixtures of 14 calcareous grassland plant species drawn from three functional groups, we looked at the effects of elevated atmospheric CO 2 on contrasting levels of ecosystem performance (species, functional group and community). Experimental communities were subjected to ambient (≈350 μmol mol-1) or elevated CO2 (≈600 μmol mol-1) in controlled environments, with grazing simulated by clipping at monthly intervals for 546 days. 2. We assessed the effect of elevated CO2 on plant performance by quantifying the productivity (biomass) and cover of component species. We also examined the effect of elevated CO 2 on the vertical structure of the plant canopy. Elevated CO 2 resulted in a significant increase in total community biomass only following nutrient addition. Within functional groups, non-leguminous forb species had significantly greater biomass and cover in elevated CO2 both before and after nutrient addition, although the effect was mainly due to the influence of one species (Centaurea nigra). Grasses, in contrast, responded negatively to elevated CO2, although again significant reductions in biomass and cover could mainly be ascribed to a single species (Brachypodium pinnatum). Legumes exhibited increased biomass and cover in elevated CO 2 (the effects being particularly marked for Anthyllis vulneraria and Lotus corniculatus), but this response disappeared following nutrient addition. Vertical structure was little affected by CO2 treatment. 3. We conclude that due to the idiosyncratic responses of individual species, the categorization of plants into broad functional groups is of limited use in guiding our understanding of the impacts of elevated atmospheric CO2 on plant communities.","Biodiversity; Chalk grassland; Climate change; Functional groups; Vertical structure","calcareous grassland; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; functional group; vegetation structure; Anthyllis; Anthyllis vulneraria; Brachypodium; Brachypodium pinnatum; Centaurea; Centaurea nigra; Lotus; Lotus corniculatus; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942623791

Data were collected by peer- and non-peer-reviewed literature searches, key informant interviews, reviews of Internet sites, and a nationwide survey. Study conclusions found confusion about the legitimacy of advocacy, lack of priority and funding for interventions that take more time versus quick fixes, variable leadership, reluctance to take risks, and a political climate that often discourages government agencies to take on these interventions.

It has the potential for monitoring the degree of premixedness of reacting fuel and air in industrial gas turbine combustors, where operation with lean premixed mixtures is important for reduction of NOx emissions. The spatial resolution of the sensor is evaluated by comparing OH* chemiluminescence measurement from the CS with laser induced OH fluorescence, in the cone-shaped premixed flame of a Bunsen burner.

Principal pathologic features of chronic airway diseases, like asthma, are airway inflammation and mucous hypersecretion with excessive amounts of luminal mucus and increased numbers of mucus-secreting cells in regions of the respiratory tract that normally have few or no mucous cells (ie, mucous cell metaplasia). The overall goal of the present project was to understand the adverse effects of urban air fine particulate matter (PM2.5; < or = 2.5 pm in aerodynamic diameter)* on normal airways and airways compromised with airway inflammation and excess mucus. Our project was specifically designed to (1) examine the chemical and physical characteristics of PM2.5 and other airborne pollutants in the outdoor air of a local Detroit community with a high incidence of childhood asthma; (2) determine the effects of this community-based PM2.5 on the airway epithelium in normal rats and rats compromised with preexisting hypersecretory airway diseases (ie, animal models of human allergic airway disease--asthma and chronic bronchitis); and (3) identify the chemical or physical components of PM2.5 that are responsible for PM2.5 -induced airway inflammation and epithelial alterations in these animal models. Two animal models of airway disease were used to examine the effects of PM2.5 exposure on preexisting hypersecretory airways: neutrophilic airway inflammation induced by endotoxin challenge in F344 rats and eosinophilic airway inflammation induced by ovalbumin (OVA) challenge in BN rats. A mobile air monitoring and exposure laboratory equipped with inhalation exposure chambers for animal toxicology studies, air pollution monitors, and particulate collection devices was used in this investigation. The mobile laboratory was parked in a community in southwestern Detroit during the summer months when particulate air pollution is usually high (July and September 2000). We monitored the outdoor air pollution in this community daily, and exposed normal and compromised rats to concentrated PM2.5 from this local urban atmosphere. Rats in the inhalation studies were exposed for 1 day or for 4 or 5 consecutive days (10 hours/day) to either filtered air (controls) or concentrated ambient particles (CAPs) delivered by a Harvard ambient fine particle concentrator. Rats were killed 24 hours after the end of the exposure. Biochemical, morphometric, and molecular techniques were used to identify airway epithelial and inflammatory responses to CAPs. Lung lobes were also either intratracheally lavaged with saline to determine cellular composition and protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) or removed for analysis by inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICPMS) to detect retention of ambient PM2.5--derived trace elements. The Harvard concentrator effectively concentrated the fine ambient particles from this urban atmosphere (10-30 times) without significantly changing the major physicochemical features of the atmospheric particles. Daily CAPs mass concentrations during the 10-hour exposure period (0800-1800) in July ranged from 16 to 895 microg/m3 and in September ranged from 81 to 755 microg/m3. In general, chemical characteristics of ambient particles were conserved through the concentrator into the exposure chamber. Single or repeated exposures to CAPs did not cause adverse effects in the nasal or pulmonary airways of healthy F344 or BN rats. In addition, CAPs-related toxicity was not observed in F344 rats pretreated with bacterial endotoxin. Variable airway responses to CAPs exposure were observed in BN rats with preexisting allergic airway disease induced by OVA sensitization and challenge. Only OVA-challenged BN rats exposed to CAPs for 5 consecutive days in September 2000 had significant increases in airway mucosubstances and pulmonary inflammation compared to saline-challenged/air-exposed control rats. OVA-challenged BN rats that were repeatedly exposed to CAPs in July 2000 had only minor CAPs-related effects. In only the September 5-day exposure protocol, PM2.5 trace elements of anthropogenic origin (La, V, and S) were recovered from the lung tissues of CAPs-exposed rats. Recovery of these specific trace elements was greatest in rats with OVA-induced allergic airway disease. Additional laboratory experiments using intratracheal instillations of ambient PM2.5 samples were performed to identify bioactive agents in the CAPs to which rats had been exposed in the inhalation exposure component. Because the most pronounced effects of CAPs inhalation were found in BN rats with OVA-induced allergic airways exposed in September, we used ambient PM2.5 samples that were collected on 2 days during the September CAPs inhalation exposures to use for instillation. Ambient PM2.5 samples were collected, fractionated into soluble and insoluble species, and then compared with each other and with total PM2.5 for their effects in healthy BN rats and those with OVA-induced allergic airway disease. Intratracheal instillation of the insoluble fraction of PM2.5 caused mild neutrophilic inflammation in the lungs of healthy rats. However, total PM2.5 or the soluble or insoluble fractions instilled in rats with OVA-induced airway inflammation did not enhance the inflammation or the airway epithelial remodeling that was evident in some of the BN rats exposed to CAPs by inhalation. Therefore, the results from this instillation component did not suggest what fractions of the CAPs may have been responsible for enhancing OVA-induced airway mucosubstances and pulmonary inflammation observed in the inhalation exposure component. In summary, inhaled CAPs-related pulmonary alterations in the affected OVA-challenged rats appeared to be related to the chemical composition, rather than the mass concentration, to which the animals were exposed. Results of the trace element analysis in the lungs of CAPs-exposed BN rats exposed in September suggested that air particles derived from identified local combustion sources were preferentially retained in allergic airways. These results demonstrate that short-term exposures to CAPs from this southwestern Detroit community caused variable responses in laboratory rats and suggest that adverse biological responses to ambient PM2.5 may be associated more closely with local sources of particles and weather patterns than with particle mass.",,"air pollutant; air pollution; animal; animal model; article; bronchus hyperreactivity; brown Norway rat; chemistry; child; comparative study; environmental monitoring; exposure; Fischer 344 rat; health; human; hyperplasia; lung function test; male; metaplasia; methodology; mucosa; particle size; pathology; pneumonia; rat; respiratory tract mucosa; school; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Animals; Bronchial Hyperreactivity; Child; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Hyperplasia; Inhalation Exposure; Male; Metaplasia; Michigan; Models, Animal; Mucous Membrane; Particle Size; Pneumonia; Rats; Rats, Inbred BN; Rats, Inbred F344; Respiratory Function Tests; Respiratory Mucosa; Schools; Urban Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16644371715

Estimating isoprene fluxes for a given forest ecosystem requires knowledge of foliar biomass, segregated by species, and the isoprene emission characteristics of the individual tree species comprising the forest. In this study, approximately 38% of 125 tree species examined at six sites in the Brazilian Amazon emitted isoprene. Given logistical difficulties and extremely high species diversity, it was possible to screen only a small percentage of tree species, and we propose a protocol for estimating the emission capacity of unmeasured taxa using a taxonomic approach, in which we assign to an unmeasured genus a value based on the percentage of genera within its plant family which have been shown to emit isoprene. Combining this information with data obtained from 14 tree censuses at four Neotropical forest sites, we have estimated the percentage of isoprene-emitting biomass at each site. The relative contribution of each genus of tree is estimated as the basal area of all trees of that genus divided by the total basal area of the plot. Using this technique, the percentage of isoprene-emitting biomass varied from 20% to 42% (mean = 31%; SD = 8%). Responses of isoprene emission to varying light and temperature, measured on a sun-adapted leaf of mango (Mangifera indica L.), suggest that existing algorithms developed for temperate species are adequate for tropical species as well. Incorporating these algorithms, estimates of isoprene-emitting biomass, isoprene emission capacity, and site foliar biomass into a canopy flux model, canopy-scale fluxes of isoprene were predicted and compared with the above-canopy fluxes measured at two sites. Our bottom-up approach overestimates fluxes by about 50%, but variations in measured fluxes between the two sites are largely explained by observed variation in the amount of isoprene-emitting biomass. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Atmospheric chemistry; Forest inventory; Isoprene; Neotropical forests; VOC","atmosphere-biosphere interaction; biogenic emission; forest canopy; isoprene; Neotropical region; Amazonia; South America; Mangifera; Mangifera indica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642511637

Using pollen floral, clay mineral and stable carbon isotope analyses of sediments from the upper Tuscahoma Formation on the eastern US Gulf Coast (eastern Mississippi and western Alabama), we document paratropical floral changes across the Palaeocene-Eocene boundary from the Wahalak #2 and lower Harrell cores. Data indicate strong changes in the abundance of kaolinite that correlate with changes in relative abundance of native pollen taxa. There is no evidence for a transient, extra-tropical flora on the US Gulf Coast that may characterize the IETM. Immigration and extinction are not associated with this event. Instead, Early Eocene plant immigration occurs in pulses and therefore is not associated directly with climate change during the IETM. The two cores share the same regional species pool but compositional differences are stronger between cores than they are either through changes in environment, increased soil erosion or chemical weathering, or through the introduction of non-native plants. Our data suggest that vegetation change across the Palaeocene-Eocene boundary is not a single event but rather a sequence of cascading events.","13C; Kaolinite; Lower Eocene; Palynology; US Gulf Coast; Vegetation","Eocene; flora; global warming; paleoclimate; vegetation history; Alabama; Mississippi; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642268296

This book is the first to compare the costs and outcomes of these approaches by examining realworld applications. In a unique format, paired case studies from the United States and Europe contrast direct regulation on one side of the Atlantic with an incentivebased policy on the other. For example, Germany?s direct regulation of SO2 emissions is compared with an incentive approach in the U.S. Direct regulation of water pollution via the U.S. Clean Water Act is contrasted with Holland?s incentive-based fee system. Additional studies contrast solutions for eliminating leaded gasoline and reducing nitrogen oxide emissions, CFCs, and chlorinated solvents. The cases presented in Choosing Environmental Policy were selected to allow the sharpest, most direct comparisons of direct regulation and incentive-based strategies. In practice, environmental policy is often a mix of both types of instruments. This innovative investigation will interest scholars, students, and policymakers who want more precise information as to what kind of 'blend' will yield the most effective policy. Are incentive instruments more efficient than regulatory ones? Do regulatory policies necessarily have higher administrative costs? Are incentive policies more difficult to monitor? Are firms more likely to oppose market-based instruments or traditional regulation? These are some of the important questions the authors address, often with surprising results. © 2004 by Resources for the Future. All rights reserved.

Early bicarbonate-induced changes in protein phosphorylation were probed using a commercial antibody against the phosphorylated form of the consensus substrate site for cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase. The antibody detected relatively few bands in sperm extracts, of which only a small number showed incubation-dependent changes. While the quantitative response varied between boar ejaculates, in general terms bicarbonate induced phosphorylation increases in bands of 96, 64, and 59 kDa within 80 sec. The changes reached a maximum after about 160 sec, declined somewhat thereafter, and then increased again slowly as incubation progressed further (up to 21 min). The bicarbonate-induced increases were strongly dependent on the presence of BSA in the incubation medium. They were inhibited by H89 (PKA inhibitor) but not by GF (PKC inhibitor), and were enhanced by papaverine (phosphodiesterase inhibitor) and by calyculin (protein phosphatase inhibitor). The cyclic AMP analogue cBIMPS was able to mimic bicarbonate action though its effect was less dramatic. Stearated Ht31, a permeable inhibitor of PKA's binding to A-kinase anchoring protein, did not affect either the intensity or the specificity of the bicarbonate-induced phosphorylation changes, though it blocked motility entirely. Immunocytochemical studies revealed marked bicarbonate-dependent phosphorylation changes in the post-acrosomal region of the head and in the neck, midpiece, and anterior regions of the tail. Fractionation of stimulated spermatozoa showed that all bands detectable with the antibody were bound to heads and to midpieces and associated large tail fragments; no bands were detected in either small tail or membrane fragments or in the cytoplasmic fraction. Differential extraction of the midpiece/large tail fraction revealed two protein bands with closely similar electrophoretic mobilities to the 96- and 59-kDa phosphorylated bands; MALDI-TOF analyses of these bands revealed both to be members of the Odf2 family. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Capacitation; Cyclic AMP; Protein kinase A; Signaling","2 [1 (3 dimethylaminopropyl) 3 indolyl] 3 (3 indolyl)maleimide; bicarbonate; calyculin A; cyclic AMP; cyclic AMP dependent protein kinase; n [2 (4 bromocinnamylamino)ethyl] 5 isoquinolinesulfonamide; phosphoprotein; protein kinase C inhibitor; animal cell; article; catalysis; enzyme activity; immunocytochemistry; male; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; molecular weight; nonhuman; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; priority journal; protein phosphorylation; signal transduction; sperm; spermatozoon capacitation; swine; Animals; Bicarbonates; Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; Male; Phosphodiesterase Inhibitors; Phosphoproteins; Phosphorylation; Proteins; Serum Albumin, Bovine; Sperm Capacitation; Spermatozoa; Swine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0942297993

The instruments were deployed at four sets of paired roadside and urban background locations, three in London and one in Birmingham (UK) and the sampling protocols aimed to give equal weight to all seasons of the year. In addition to determination of sample mass, concentrations have been determined for major chemical components as follows: sulphate, nitrate, chloride, organic carbon, elemental carbon, iron and calcium. The measured concentrations have been converted to equivalent quantities of ammonium sulphate, ammonium nitrate (in PM2.5), sodium nitrate (in PM2.5-10), sodium chloride, elemental carbon, carbon compounds, gypsum and iron-rich dusts. The mass of strongly bound water has also been calculated following the mass closure methodology of Harrison et al. (Atmos. Environ. 37 (2003) 4927). Examination of the difference between roadside (mean 34.7μgm-3 PM10) and corresponding urban background (mean 23.2μgm-3 PM10) samples indicates average mass increments of 11.5μgm-3 of PM10 and 8.0μgm-3 of PM2.5 for the four site pairs, and that the roadside particle increment is comprised very largely of elemental carbon, organic compounds and iron-rich dusts. The major component composition lies somewhere between that reported as typical of the eastern and western US. A comparison with PM2.5 and PM15 sampled in Leeds (UK) in 1982 shows a decline in all major constituents except mineral dusts (PM 2.5 only). In a comparison of data for days with PM10 above the EU 24-h Limit Value of 50μgm-3 with data from all days, the component showing the greatest ratio between high pollution days and all days is fine particle nitrate. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Starburst regions are known to be associated with diffuse X-ray emission, and in this case the X-ray emission from the galaxy shows an interesting morphological structure within the galaxy, clearly associated with the central regions of active star formation. Of the two main regions of star formation in this galaxy, X-ray emission associated with the older is identified whereas little is detected from the younger, providing an insight into the evolutionary process of the formation of superbubbles around young stellar clusters. The spectra of the diffuse emission from the galaxy can be fitted with a two-temperature-component thermal model with kT = 0.14 keV and 0.52 keV, and analysis of this emission suggests that NGC 4214 will suffer a blow-out in the future. The point source population of the galaxy has an X-ray luminosity function with a slope of -0.76. This result, together with those for other dwarf starburst galaxies (NGC 4449 and NGC 5253), was added to a sample of luminosity functions for spiral and starburst galaxies. The slope of the luminosity function of dwarf starbursts is seen to be similar to that of their larger counterparts and clearly flatter than those seen in spirals. Further comparisons between the luminosity functions of starbursts and spiral galaxies are also made.","Galaxies: individual: NGC 4214; Galaxies: starburst; ISM: jets and outflows; X-rays: galaxies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442286307

Response patterns are characterized using empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs) and the quasi-EOFs of Harvey and Wigley (the first qEOF field, discussed here, is given by the correlation between local year-by-year temperature changes and the global mean temperature change). The first temperature EOF accounts for 80-95% of the space-time variation of the CO2 run in all of the models, and is almost identical to qEOF1 of the temperature response or to the temperature change pattern averaged over the last 30 years of the simulations. EOF1 accounts for 80-95% of the space-time variation in the CO2+aerosol runs in six of the eight models. The CO2 response patterns of different models are highly correlated with one another (R2 generally &gt;0.5), and are also highly correlated with the CO2+aerosol response patterns (R2≥ 0.85 in all except one model). The difference between CO2 and CO2+aerosol runs can be represented by EOF1 of the year-by-year differences, by qEOF1 of the year-by-year differences, or by the difference in temperature averaged over the last 30 years of each run. In models where these representations are highly correlated with each other, they are also highly correlated with CO2 EOF1. In other cases, aerosol EOF1 is modestly to highly correlated with control EOF1 (i.e.: the year-by-year differences between CO2 and CO2+aerosol runs are dominated by internal variability), while aerosol qEOF1 and the 30-year difference are highly correlated with each other. For all models, the decadal mean temperature change can be closely replicated by scaling the CO2 EOF1 pattern based on the global mean temperature changes (RMSE for the last decade is &lt;6% of the RMS temperature change for CO2 runs, &lt;8% for CO2+ aerosol runs). The first EOF of the precipitation response to increasing CO2 accounts for only 10-30% of the space-time variation, and is generally highly correlated (R2 up to 0.85) with control EOF1. In all of the models, there is an increase in precipitation in the ITCZ and a decrease in bands at or near 30°S and 30°N. In many models there is an El Niño-like response, including a substantial decrease in precipitation over the Amazon. Global-mean precipitation increases in all models due to CO2 forcing, but aerosols appear to have a disproportionally large effect in suppressing the increase compared to their effect in suppressing the warming. There is evidence in some models that the non-absorbing aerosols considered here reduce summer monsoon rainfall compared to the changes that would be expected based on the globally averaged effect of aerosols on precipitation. When regional precipitation changes over time are predicted by scaling a fixed precipitation-change pattern with the global mean temperature change, the global mean RMSE in the predicted change in decadal-mean precipitation is 25-35% of the global RMS precipitation changes by the end of the simulation. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"atmosphere-ocean coupling; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; general circulation model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10444222594

This purification ability of plants is considered a promising method for indoor air purification because of the low cost and high purification performance. Therefore, several studies have been carried out to investigate the relationship between the air purification ability of plants and environmental conditions. Nevertheless, the purification mechanism and process have not been clarified yet. In this paper, we investigated the air purification process in plants by bioelectrical potential analysis using linear and nonlinear analysis methods. First, we showed that two types of plants have a high air purification ability; Schefflera and Boston fern. Next, we measured AC bioelectrical potential during the purifying process of plants for pollutant gas. Then, we evaluated the power spectra of time series data of the bioelectrical potential. We found that the power spectra shifted to a lower level after gas injection over all frequencies. Thus, the higher power spectrum came from possible higher physiological activities of the plant. Finally, we introduced a nonlinear analysis method from the dynamical system theory. We transformed the time series data of the potential to a higher dimensional state space using a delay coordinate, which is often used in the field of nonlinear time series analysis. The results show that the orbits in the reconstructed state space have a large variation in gas injection. These experimental results suggest that the measurement of bioelectrical potential could become a useful method for evaluating the air purification ability of plants.","Air purification ability of plant; Bioelectrical potential; Delay coordinate; Dynamical system; Power spectra","Air pollution; Data reduction; Lighting; Natural frequencies; Nonlinear systems; Purification; Time series analysis; Voltage dividers; Air purification ability of plant; Bioelectrical potential; Delay coordinate; Dynamical systems; Power spectra; Bioelectric phenomena",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144306462

The structure of the as-thermolyzed amorphous ceramics and of ceramic samples after additional heat treatments was investigated by diffraction experiments in the wide-angle and the small-angle scattering regimes. Adopting contrast variation by combination of X-rays and neutrons and isotopic substitution, the observed correlations were assigned to individual atomic pairs. The atomic distances found in the ceramics correspond well with the distances in graphite and α-Si 3N4. Using the concentration contrast method it could be shown quantitatively that the amorphous Si-C-N ceramics consist of an amorphous graphite-like phase and of amorphous Si3+(1/4)xN4-xC x (x = 0-4). The partial pair correlation functions of the two phases could be evaluated. The size of the phase-separated regions, of the order of 10 Å in the as-thermolyzed ceramics, as determined from small-angle scattering, increases upon annealing up to some 10 A. The partial structure factor of the amorphous carbon phase was simulated by a model. The simulation shows that the atomic arrangement of the amorphous carbon phase in Si-C-N ceramics in the layers is similar to that of glassy carbon, but the order between the layers is less pronounced. With increasing temperature the arrangement of the layers approaches the order in glassy carbon. A sputter-deposited Si-C-N ceramic shows similar short-range order, but no phase separation on a medium-range scale, as compared with precursor-derived ceramics.",,"Annealing; Computer simulation; Crystal atomic structure; Heat treatment; Substitution reactions; X rays; Thermolysis; Ceramic materials; carbon; graphite; nitrogen; silicon derivative; article; atomic particle; calculation; ceramics; chemical structure; correlation function; diffraction; heat treatment; neutron scattering; phase separation; radiation scattering; synthesis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347720651

The design objectives include the obvious requirement to avoid large sudden releases and the more challenging task of keeping long-term leak rates to de minimis levels. Long-term retention requirements are a function of both the atmospheric stabilization target for greenhouse gases and the degree of reliance on CO2 capture and storage as a mitigation measure. A robust strategy will employ the CO2 capture and storage method as a component of a portfolio of programs that emphasize energy efficiency and use of renewable energy. To preserve options to stabilize greenhouse gases at prudent levels, it appears we will need to rely extensively on all three components of this portfolio.

Nine years of study (1992-2001) contain important observations of the intra-and interannual sediment response under variations in wave climate. In order to describe the variability of the nearshore system, wave forcing and beach response were modeled as annually periodic functions superimposed upon long-term trends. The amplitudes of the seasonal periodicity in significant wave heights (A Hs=0.94 m±0.06), dominant wave period (ATp=2.1 s±0.1), and mean wave direction (Aθ=12.3°±2. 0) exhibit larger variability than the long-term trends observed within a year (βHs=6.7 cm/year±2.6, βTp=0.15 s/year±0.04, βθ=3°S/year±1.0). Assuming alongshore transport of sediment at Agate Beach is mostly wave-driven, and that the northward flux of sediment goes to zero at the northern end of the beach, the observed long-term increase in significant wave heights (β Hs) and change to a more southerly approach in wave direction (βθ) (coincident with the 1997-1998 El Niño/1998-1999 La Niña sequence) result in net accretion along Agate Beach. Beach survey data collected by RTK-GPS and lidar quantify the increase in subaerial sediment volume, ΔVb=1.84×105 m3. This change in volume corresponds to a mean bed elevation increase of 0.21 m over the 8.7×105 m2 area of study. The amplitude of annual variation in sediment volume was A Vb=7.85×104 m3±2.13×10 4 m3. Video image analysis (1992-2001) also quantifies a long-term offshore migration of the outer sand bar (βOBx=11.0 m/year±0.8) coincident with the increase in subaerial beach sediment volume at the northern end of the Newport littoral cell. This result suggests accretion of sediments in a much wider cross-shore region than observed within the beach survey record. Similar to the signature of beach volume variations, the cross-shore position of the outer sand bar also varies with season (A Oβx=114.9 m±4.2). The agreement between long-term trends in wave statistics and morphology suggests a directly forced beach response. An empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis of the topographic survey record at Agate Beach resolves two distinct eigen-modes of variance associated with seasonal patterns of sediment flux. The first mode (34%) is related to the summer growth of a dune field that is limited to elevations above MHW, z=1.076 m. Analysis of concurrent wind field measurements shows this mode of variance is well correlated with aeolian processes. The second mode (21%) is wave-driven, and corresponds to the seasonal behavior of the beach surface below MHW. Observations show the MHW elevation serves as a transitional zone between dune related and wave-driven processes that affect the seasonal evolution of Agate Beach. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Herbaceous perennials, which produce an annual crop of above ground shoots, may have some important advantages over both of these systems. Herbaceous perennials require far fewer energy and financial inputs than annual arable crops. They can be higher yielding than forestry crops and utilize existing farm equipment. Perennial energy crops can sequester carbon into soil previously under annual arable crops, providing potential additional income in carbon credits. The advantages and disadvantages of different plant types are explained to show herbaceous perennials hold special promise as bioenergy crops. C 4 photosynthesis allows greater efficiencies in the conversion of sunlight energy to biomass energy, and of nitrogen and water use. However, few plants in temperate climates use this more efficient process. One exception is the rhizomatous perennial grass Miscanthus, which is a C 4 plant and exceptionally cold tolerant. Miscanthus is now being grown commercially in the European Union (EU) for direct combustion in local-area power stations. It may also have longer-term potential as a feedstock for other bio-based industry. The lessons learned from trials of this crop in the EU are summarized, potential yields in Illinois predicted and a tentative comparison of the economics of growing Miscanthus versus traditional row crops developed. Overall, the results suggest that Miscanthus could yield an average of 33 t of dry matter per hectare in Illinois. At current energy prices the crop would be profitable, if grown for 4 or more years, even without subsidy.","alternative crop; biofuel; C 4 photosynthesis; economics; European Union; feedstock; Illinois; Miscanthus; production; switchgrass","alternative energy; C4 plant; carbon sequestration; energy crop; perennial plant; Eurasia; Europe; Illinois; North America; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444295947

Statistically significant reductions in urinary 1-HOP were observed at most time points examined in groups of smokers who reduced to different extents. Reductions in the waitlist group were also generally significantly greater than baseline levels. The reductions in 1-HOP were usually modest (ranging from 14% to 35% in all groups and time points examined), which partially reflects the fact that there are sources of pyrene exposure other than cigarette smoke. Thus, cessation of smoking would only be expected to result in partial reductions of 1-HOP. The observed reductions in 1-HOP were not fully consistent with reductions in CPD probably due to uncontrolled dietary factors. Collectively, the results demonstrate that some smokers can achieve substantial reductions in 1-HOP, reflecting reduced uptake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, by reducing CPD, but there was not a consistent relationship between these parameters.",,"1 hydroxypyrene; biological marker; carcinogen; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; pyrene; adult; aged; article; cigarette smoking; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; dietary intake; human; lung cancer; major clinical study; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; smoking cessation; smoking habit; United States; urinalysis; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Biological Markers; Confidence Intervals; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Monitoring, Physiologic; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Reference Values; Sensitivity and Specificity; Smoking; Smoking Cessation; Statistics, Nonparametric",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942602686

The purpose of the programme is to quantify the pollution, apportion source contributions, follow the trends, and identify midlatitude source areas and transport pathways. The project has been carried out in North Greenland as integrated monitoring, which is an interacting combination of field measurements and model calculations of atmospheric transport and transformation in the Northern Hemisphere. At the monitoring site at Station Nord the large and seasonally recurrent variations in the pollutant concentrations are testimony to the influence in this region of the phenomenon of Arctic Haze. These results can only be understood in terms of long range transport from distant pollution sources. The measurements also comprise a large number of particle-born elements. These results are used to build receptor models, which show that the ambient concentrations and their variations to a high degree can be explained by the influence of only four source types of both natural and anthropogenic nature. The challenging phenomena of atmospheric ozone and mercury depletion around Polar sunrise have been studied at Station Nord over several years. The results show that these two phenomena are closely connected, presumably through photochemical reactions with atmospheric halogens released from sea ice. A large-scale Eulerian model system for the Northern Hemisphere has been developed in this AMAP project. The validity of the model is illustrated by comparisons between measured and calculated air concentrations. The model has been used to calculate both the vertical distribution and the atmospheric depositions for several pollutants at various locations in Greenland and split into quantified contributions from different and geographically distant source areas. Mercury deposition estimates for the Northern Hemisphere are also presented. They show that the mercury depletion events are accompanied by very intense depositions to land and sea of reactive mercury that may seriously affect the Arctic ecosystems. Finally, measurement and model data are combined to demonstrate, despite considerable meteorological noise, that ambient air concentrations in North-eastern Greenland have decreased during the last decade. Quantified trends, attributable to emission reductions in distant source areas, are presented for several pollutants. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Owing to their enhanced spectral resolution and sensitivity, this new generation of high-resolution infrared vertical sounders is first aimed at improving the vertical resolution of temperature and water vapor profile retrievals needed by the weather forecasting community. Another important possible use of these instruments, in the context of the study of global warming, is to permit the retrieval of the concentrations of greenhouse gases like CO2, N2O, CH4, etc. In order to reach these two main objectives, improvement in the modeling of the radiative transfer is therefore necessary. One of the points which still needs some improvements is the contribution of the downward radiation reflected by the surface back to the satellite which is often improperly accounted for in radiative transfer calculation to save computer time. In this article, we show how it is possible to simplify the problem through the computation of a spectrally dependent ""effective"" emissivity for which a simple parametrization is proposed, while preserving the accuracy of the results. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Many proponents of sustainable energy anticipate that electric generation from renewable sources would thrive in a deregulated market, driven by consumer demand for ""green"" energy and the end of incentives to build large central power plants under the cost-plus profits guaranteed by state utility commissions. This paper examines the flaws in this expectation. After reviewing the highly cyclical nature of U.S. energy policy making in recent decades, the study links the ineffectiveness of policy with the institutional setting. Under electric utility market restructuring, renewable energy generation (wind, biomass, solar, geothermal, and small-scale hydro) must overcome barriers such as price distortions, lack of storage capability, discriminatory transmission system access, and the end of linked utility rate hikes guaranteed to cover the additional expense of renewable generation. In the absence of strong federal leadership, the state commitment to renewable energy has been uneven under utility restructuring. Moreover, nuclear power - the other leading alternative to fossil fuel use - is beset by serious problems. Only renewable energy options offer long-term hope for sustainability. Along these lines, green marketing, renewable portfolio standards, system benefit charges, carbon taxes, public power, ""Community Choice,"" and production credits - all based on recent U.S. and European experience - are critically examined and recommendations made for changing course. At present, during this highly fluid period of utility restructuring, and absent more forceful regulation and demand management, it is dubious whether U.S. electricity market reform can encourage sufficient conversion to renewable energy to stem a rising tide of greenhouse gas emissions. © 2004 by Association of American Geographers.","Carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions; Electric utility; Energy policy; Renewable energy; Wind power","electricity generation; energy policy; renewable resource",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-25144506880

The application and validation of an atmospheric chemical transport model to the SJV will aid in the design of emissions control programs to improve air quality. The extensive data required for meaningful Eulerian modeling of airborne PM in the SJV region were collected as a part of the 1995 Integrated Monitoring Study (IMS95). In the current study, the CIT-UCD source-oriented air quality model is applied to the IMS95 data set to verify model performance in the SJV. This article represents the first published application of a full-scale photochemical grid model with diagnostic meteorological data to simulate PM concentrations in the SJV and is the first study outside of the Los Angeles area to include complete PM model performance statistics. The CIT-UCD model results show excellent agreement with most measurements collected during the IMS95 4-6 January 1996 modeling episode. The fractional bias (FBIAS) for SJV ozone and PM10 are approximately 0.16 and -0.19, respectively, for all SJV stations excluding Bakersfield. Most modeled criteria gases, PM precursor gases, and chemically speciated PM concentrations show strong agreement with their corresponding measurements at the Chowchilla, Fresno, Kern Wildlife Refuge, and Bakersfield sampling stations. Furthermore, the modeled PM size distribution of nitrate, ammonium ion, and sulfate agree well with cascade impactor measurements made at Bakersfield on 5 January 1996. Given the robust model agreement with both gas and condensed phase measurements, it appears that the CIT-UCD model adequately captures the fundamental transport and chemical reactivity of air pollutants in the IMS95 domain during a typical severe pollution episode. These results suggest that the CIT-UCD model can be used to explore control scenarios designed to improve air quality in the SJV. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Willow energy crops are being developed in the northeast US as a fuel source for increasing biomass energy and bioproduct demands. A life cycle inventory is presented that characterizes the full cradle-to-grave energy and environmental performance of willow biomass-to-electricity. A willow biomass production model is developed using demonstration-scale field experience from New York. Scenarios are presented that mimic anticipated cofiring operations, including supplemental use of wood residues, at an existing coal-fired generating facility. At a cofiring rate of 10% biomass, the system net energy ratio (electricity delivered divided by total fossil fuel consumed) increases by 8.9% and net global warming potential decreases by 7-10%. Net SO2 emissions are reduced by 9.5% and a significant reduction in NOx emissions is expected.

Imports of fossil fuels had increased significantly, reducing self-sufficiency and security of energy supply. Available hydropower resources had to a great extent been developed, and nuclear power plants were planned to provide the base-load generation needed to meet increased electricity consumption. Wood fuels and peat were considered optimal choices for combined heat and power (CHP) production in district heating and industry. Promotion incentives that included investment subsidies, taxes on fossil fuels, research and development, and dissemination activities were implemented with good results: in 20 years the annual use of peat increased from nearly nil to 80 PJ in 1996, and the increase in the annual use of wood fuels in the same period was also 80 PJ. Research and development on bioenergy was intensive because technologies feasible for local conditions were not available and the competitiveness of bioenergy was poor except in the case of wood residues from the forest industry. Examples of important innovations and their successful commercialisation are several fluidised bed concepts for CHP plants using fuels of low and variable energy values and new peat harvesting concepts. Because R&amp;D investments were limited it was decided on the national level that the core technologies for wind and solar energy could be imported from other countries with higher R&amp;D expenditure, although some important components and local applications were developed by the Finnish industry. In the 1990s the need for mitigation of human-induced climate change brought a new driver for renewable energy sources (RES). Earlier drivers, such as security of energy supply, increase of employment opportunities in rural areas, and new use for set-aside fields, still existed. CO2 taxes were already introduced on fossil fuels and peat in 1990 in Finland. The climate strategy of Finland from 1999 includes the Action Plan on Renewable Energy Sources. National targets of RES for 2010 are 27 % (385 PJ) of the primary energy consumption and 31.5 % (27 TWh) of the electricity demand, up from 22 % and 27 % in 1997. RES will take care of about one-quarter (4-5 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 equivalent) of the greenhouse gas emission reduction needed to meet Finland's commitment for the first Kyoto period, 2008-2012. In 2002, bioenergy, excluding peat, covered 20 % of the total primary energy consumption and 10 % of the electricity demand in Finland, which are the highest figures in the industrialised countries. The available technical biomass resources would enable even the doubling of the current utilisation of bioenergy without decreasing the production volume of the wood-processing industry. National promotion incentives are currently being updated because deregulation of the energy market, the EU and worldwide mechanisms, such as emission allowance trading, green certificates and Kyoto mechanisms, will radically change the market for RES. © 2004 International Energy Initiative, Inc.",,"Biomass; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Cogeneration plants; Commerce; Competition; Deregulation; Electric power utilization; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy resources; Energy security; Energy utilization; Fluidized beds; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Natural resources; Nuclear fuels; Nuclear power plants; Peat; Renewable energy resources; Solar energy; Wood; Combined heat and power production; Electricity-consumption; Employment opportunities; Greenhouse gas emission reduction; Primary energy consumption; Renewable energy source; Research and development; Wood processing industry; Wood fuels; Chandipura virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-62049083015

The proxies include bulk-sediment major and minor elements, organic carbon and carbonate concentrations, δ15N, and planktonic foraminiferal species assemblage and carbon isotope determinations. The collective results demonstrate that marine productivity in this area was not simply linearly related to cold and warm cycles except during the millennial-scale climate oscillations of marine isotope stage (MIS) 3. During that interval, the upwelling cell and resulting high productivity were active during warm interstadial events and were largely inactive during cool stadial events. However, the Last Glacial Maximum was also relatively productive. Productivity increased dramatically during the Bø lling warm interval, while the Ållerød and Younger Dryas were much less productive. High coccolithophorid abundance commenced during the earliest Holocene after 10 ka. The complexity of the productivity response was probably related to interplay between local winds, as well as California Undercurrent strength.

M. Curtis, K. R. Ronan, and C. M. Borduin (2004) meta-analysis for the broader field is likely the difference in effect sizes between multisystemic therapy efficacy versus effectiveness studies. This difference has important implications for research on the transport of evidence-based treatments to community practice settings. For example, factors rarely considered in efficacy research (e.g., funding structures, organizational climate, program maturity, site characteristics) are emerging as important determinants of treatment fidelity and, in turn, clinical outcomes for practice in real-world settings. Current research is clearly demonstrating that evidence-based practices can be successfully transported, but much remains to be learned regarding the optimal parameters of such transport.","Effectiveness research; Evidence-based practice; Multisystemic therapy; Transportability","addiction; adolescent; child; community mental health center; drug dependence treatment; evidence based medicine; family therapy; hospitalization; human; juvenile delinquency; mental disease; mental hospital; meta analysis; multimodality cancer therapy; review; statistics; treatment outcome; Adolescent; Child; Combined Modality Therapy; Community Mental Health Centers; Evidence-Based Medicine; Family Therapy; Hospitalization; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; Juvenile Delinquency; Mental Disorders; Meta-Analysis; Substance Abuse Treatment Centers; Substance-Related Disorders; Treatment Outcome",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644250911

Increases in prointerleukin-1β (pIL-1β) protein and IL-1β steady state mRNA levels were observed in both SCC-12F and HaCaT cells following TCDD treatment. When pretreated with α-naphthoflavone, an AhR antagonist, TCDD-mediated increases in IL-1β gene expression were attenuated, demonstrating for the first time that the environmental toxin, TCDD, can stimulate cytokine (IL-1β) gene expression in an AhR-dependent manner. Nuclear run-on experiments were performed in SCC-12 cells to determine if the AhR-dependent increases in IL-1β expression were due to transcriptional activation of the IL-1β gene. Results showed high constitutive levels of IL-1β transcriptional activity, however, TCDD treatment, which stimulated IL-1β steady state mRNA levels, failed to potentiate IL-1β transcription.

ENERCON also applies its technical and management know-how to desalination plants and has developed technical solutions for environmentally friendly desalination processes. The use of additives within membrane processes for antiscaling and antifouling can be avoided by physical effects during water flow. Prototypes on Mediterranean islands work without using any additives - a benefit for the marine environment (Barcelona Convention), for water quality and less expense for chemicals. ENERCON plants are low noise installations which can therefore be built close to drinking water consumers. The upcoming emission trading model (Kyoto Protocol) will also concern desalination plant operators, especially in the European Union. The energy levels in renewable energy resources fluctuate. For an energy efficient combination with desalination plants ENERCON has developed technical solutions so that plants can control the fluctuation of energy supply related to renewable energy resources. These desalination plants do not have a fixed point of operation - plants run in a range of 20-100% energy availability at optimum efficiency - with low energy consumption. Attention has to be turned to wind energy. Generally, desalination plants are located on the coast - which also presents excellent conditions for wind power, especially on islands. The system can work completely independently in regions without stable or any electrical networks, as well as integrated into a public net. During strong wind there is more energy available than the desalination process needs, so it can be fed into the public net. When wind conditions are poor the energy support can work the other way round. An innovative combination of desalination processes and renewable wind power can create a holistic system for water and even for energy supply. Also not being dependent on fossil energy sources may become a bigger advantage than we can expect nowadays. The prices for oil may rise in the future and the transport costs for oil (by ships or trucks) will remain a fixed expense. Investment costs per kWh from wind energy converters are steadily decreasing! Transport, set up, and expansion of ENERCON desalination plants are easily implemented because of the modular design. However, the combination with wind energy is not a must since plants ft together with all kinds of existing networks. Economic reasons are of main importance for decision makers in water services. Apart from saving expenses for fossil energy resources and additives, ENERCON desalination plants also reduce personnel costs because of fully automatic operation and a remote monitoring system. Operators can observe the plant from their offices and maintenance staff is informed about eventual problems by SMS. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This study therefore prospectively assesses the impact of position emission tomography scanning on the management of primary rectal cancer. METHODS: Forty-six patients with advanced primary rectal cancer referred for consideration of adjuvant preoperative therapy underwent position emission tomography scanning. The referring physicians prospectively recorded each patient's stage following conventional imaging and the proposed treatment plan prior to position emission tomography scanning. This was then compared with subsequent stage and actual management implemented, and the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced changes was noted by subsequent clinical follow-up. RESULTS: The surgical management of 36 of 46 patients (78 percent) was unchanged as a result of position emission tomography, even though position emission tomography upstaged disease in 3 of 36 cases (8 percent) and downstaged disease in 5 of 36 cases (14 percent). In 8 of 46 cases (17 percent), management was altered because of the position emission tomography scan findings, including 6 cases (13 percent) in which surgery was cancelled and 2 other cases (4 percent) in which the radiotherapy field was changed. Where available, follow-up confirmed the appropriateness of position emission tomography-induced management change in each case. Two patients had a change in therapy independent of the position emission tomography scan due to clinical circumstances. Overall tumor stage was changed following position emission tomography in 18 of 46 patients (39 percent). CONCLUSION: Position emission tomography scanning appears to accurately change the stage or appropriately alter the therapy of almost a third of patients with advanced primary rectal cancer. In view of this, we suggest that position emission tomography scanning be considered part of standard workup for such patients, particularly if neoadjuvant chemoradiation is being considered as part of primary management.","Positron emission tomography; Preoperative staging; Rectal carcinoma","adult; aged; article; cancer adjuvant therapy; cancer recurrence; cancer staging; clinical article; device; female; human; male; positron emission tomography; preoperative evaluation; rectum cancer; ultrasound scanner; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carcinoma; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Neoplasm Staging; Patient Care Planning; Predictive Value of Tests; Prognosis; Prospective Studies; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Rectal Neoplasms; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, Emission-Computed",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842422119

However, certain socio-economic and institutional factors prevent Spain from attaining the interrelated goals set up in those documents (namely, energy liberalisation, reduction of CO2 emissions and promotion of renewable energy). These objectives are difficult to achieve in an institutional setting, such as the Spanish one, characterised by different administrative levels (national and regional). Competencies and initiatives taken in CO2 emission mitigation through RE deployment are scattered around those government levels and lack of coordination between such administrative levels seems to be a main feature. In other words, the combined attainment of those objectives requires that policy makers coordinate local, institutional and public initiatives and examine their feasibility. This paper explores the main imbalances and coordination problems at the territorial and sector levels concerning the complex relationship between energy (production and consumption) and sustainability in Spain.

Due to the number of glycol dehydration systems in use (> 40,000 in the US) and the estimated amounts of VOC they absorb, federal and state organizations, and many foreign governments require monitoring and control of VOC emissions. Industry has expanded much effort in developing predictive method, and assuring, measurement standards to meet Clean Air Act requirements.

We hypothesized that duodenal epithelial cells expressing a mutant CFTR have enhanced resistance to acid-induced injury. To test this hypothesis, we measured duodenal epithelial cell intracellular pH (pH i), injury, and acid back-diffusion in response to a luminal acid challenge in transgenic mice. Methods: A murine colony was established for the CFTR ΔF508 (ΔF) mutation. Epithelial cell pHi was measured by microscopy with a trapped, fluorescent pH-sensitive dye in living C57BL/6 and ΔF/ΔF, +/ΔF, and +/+ mice. In vivo confocal microscopy confirmed the localization of the dye in the cytoplasm of the epithelial cells. Epithelial injury was measured fluorometrically using propidium iodide. Duodenal epithelial bicarbonate secretion and proton permeability were measured by back-titration. Bicarbonate secretion and acid back-diffusion were measured in a perfused duodenal loop. Results: Basal and post-acid exposure bicarbonate secretion were reduced in ΔF/ΔF mice, although acid back-diffusion was similar to controls. Epithelial pHi of CFTR ΔF/ΔF mice during luminal acid exposure was significantly higher than pHi in +/ΔF, +/+, or C57BL/6 mice. Acid-related epithelial injury was markedly less in ΔF/ΔF mice in comparison with the other groups. Conclusions: Increased cellular buffering power of the epithelial cells of ΔF/ΔF mice likely protects against acidification and injury during acid exposure. We speculate that this protective mechanism partially underlies the perceived relative lack of peptic ulceration in patients affected by cystic fibrosis.",,"acidification; animal cell; article; cell pH; controlled study; cystic fibrosis; duodenum; epithelium cell; gene mutation; inhibition kinetics; intestine injury; mouse; nonhuman; priority journal; provocation test; transgenic mouse",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5144227963

The coastal waters surrounding Britain and Ireland became warmer during the 20th century and, according to the UK Climate Impact Programme 2002 scenarios of change and other sources, average annual seawater temperatures may rise a further 2°C or more by the 2050s. This warming is part of a global rise in sea- and air-surface temperatures that will cause changes in the distribution and abundance of species. 2. Initially, there will not be a wholesale movement northwards of southern species or retreat northwards of northern species, because many additional factors will influence the responses of the different organisms. Such factors include the hydrodynamic characteristics of water masses, the presence of hydrographical and geographical barriers to spread and the life history characteristics (reproductive mode, dispersal capability and longevity) of species. Survey data over the past century show how organisms react to changes of the order of 0.5°C, and in the last two decades, when sea temperatures have risen by as much as 1°C, there have been significant local changes in the distribution of intertidal organisms. These past changes provide a clue to more extensive changes expected in the future if global warming develops as predicted. 3. Where species affected by climate change are dominant or key structural or functional species in biotopes, there may be a change in the extent and distribution of those biotopes. Some, dominated by predominantly northern species such as the horse mussel Modiolus modiolus, may decline and reduce their value as rich habitats for marine life. Others, characterized by southern species, for example the sea fan Eunicella verrucosa and the alcyonacean Alcyonium glomeratum, may increase in extent. 4. Using information on the life history characteristics of species, their present distribution and other factors, a key supported by a decision tree has been constructed to identify 'types' of organism according to their likely response to temperature rise. Conspicuous and easily identified rocky substratum species are good candidates to track change. Using the key, many species are shown as likely to increase their range northwards significantly. In contrast, fewer will decline in abundance and extent in the north. If, as anticipated, global warming continues, then species with distributions already accurately mapped, or being mapped at present, will provide baseline data to test forecasts.

The survey included only published studies addressing global impacts of climate change; studies that only addressed regional impacts were not included. The metric we used for change in climate is increase in global mean temperature (GMT). The focus of the analysis centred on determining the general shape of the damage curve, expressed as a function of GMT. Studies in sea level rise, agriculture, water resources, human health, energy, terrestrial ecosystems productivity, forestry, biodiversity, and marine ecosystems productivity were examined. In addition, we analysed several studies that aggregate results across sectors. Results are presented using metrics as reported in the surveyed studies and thus are not aggregated. We found that the relationships between GMT and impacts are not consistent across sectors. Some of the sectors exhibit increasing adverse impacts with increasing GMT, in particular coastal resources, biodiversity, and possibly marine ecosystem productivity. Some sectors are characterised by a parabolic relationship between temperature and impacts (benefits at lower GMT increases, damages at higher GMT increases), in particular, agriculture, terrestrial ecosystem productivity, and possibly forestry. The relationship between global impacts and increase in GMT for water, health, energy, and aggregate impacts appears to be uncertain. One consistent pattern is that beyond an approximate 3-4°C increase in GMT, all of the studies we examined, with the possible exception of forestry, show increasing adverse impacts. Thus, in total, it appears likely that there are increasing adverse impacts at higher increases in GMT. We were unable to determine the relationship between total impacts and climate change up to a 3-4°C increase in GMT. There are important uncertainties in the studies we surveyed that prevent us from a precise identification of 3-4°C as the critical temperature transition range, beyond which damages are adverse and increasing. We are confident in general however, that beyond several degrees of GMT, damages tend to be adverse and increasing. We conclude by suggesting some priorities for future research that, if undertaken, would further our understanding of how impacts are apt to vary with increases in GMT. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It was found that for this particular liquid crystal (LC) platform, the incorporation of conventional radical polymerizable groups such as acrylates in the tails was not conducive to the formation of thermotropic LC phases, presumably due to their polar nature. The resulting photoluminescent isoprenyl and 1,3-dienyl hexacatenar monomers were found to form columnar hexagonal phases at elevated temperatures (c. 45-75°C), as determined by powder X-ray diffraction. Unfortunately, photoinitiated radical polymerization studies revealed that the mesogens are susceptible to photodegradation in the LC state at elevated temperatures, resulting in the loss of both LC order and emission properties during photopolymerization. Thermally initiated radical polymerization in the absence of light, however, afforded effective crosslinking with retention of both LC order and the desired emission properties. The resulting crosslinked columnar hexagonal phases were found to exhibit emission maxima at nearly identical wavelengths, with comparable intensities relative to the unpolymerized starting materials. The effect of the different polymerizable groups on the mesogenic behaviour, polymerization characteristics, and emission properties of the hexacatenar compounds is presented.",,"acrylic acid; hydrocarbon; oligo(4 phenylenevinylene); phenyl group; unclassified drug; analytic method; article; chemical procedures; chemical structure; cross linking; light; liquid crystal; molecule; photodegradation; polymerization; spectral sensitivity; thermoluminescence",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942583816

Native natural enemies have the potential to control fall armyworm Spodoptera frugiperda (Smith) in tropical maize grown in Mexico, where this insect pest causes severe economic losses to farmers. It has been proposed that enhancing herbivore-induced volatile emissions in maize plants may help to increase the effectiveness of natural enemies, which use these volatiles to locate their prey. This will only be of immediate benefit to farmers if the activity of the natural enemies results in a direct reduction in herbivory. Here we report on field surveys for the most common natural enemies in a tropical maize-growing region in Mexico and the potential effects of these enemies on herbivory by fall armyworm. 2. Caterpillars were collected in maize fields near Poza Rica in the state of Veracruz during January and February 1999, 2000 and 2001. Plants were either naturally infested by S. frugiperda, or artificially infested with laboratory-reared larvae. Ten species of parasitoids emerged from the collected larvae and eight species of predators that are known to feed on larvae and eggs were observed on the plants. Campoletis sonorensis (Cameron) (Hymenoptera: Ichneumonidae) was the dominant parasitoid species, in 1999 and 2001. 3. Of the nine larval parasitoids collected, six (all solitary) are known to reduce herbivory, whereas one causes the host to eat more (for two species this is not known). This implies that enhancing the effectiveness of solitary endoparasitoids may benefit subsistence farmers in developing countries by immediately reducing herbivory. The overall benefit for the plant resulting from parasitoid activity also has important implications for the evolutionary role of parasitoids in contributing to selection pressures that shape indirect defences in plants.","Biological control; Fall armyworm; Maize; Mexico; Parasitoids; Pest management; Predators; Spodoptera frugiperda","Campoletis sonorensis; Hymenoptera; Ichneumonidae; Insecta; Lepidoptera; Mythimna unipuncta; Noctuidae; Phacelia congesta; Spodoptera; Spodoptera frugiperda; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242322528

Model predictions indicated that suitable climatic conditions for H. coagulata and Pierce's disease causing strains of X. fastidiosa exist in almost all grape production areas of the world, and H. coagulata may be able to colonize areas unsuitable for X. fastidiosa. Additionally, the model indicated that regions north of California will be unable to sustain populations of both pests because of cold stress, and that irrigation of agricultural and urban areas in California's deserts has removed dry stress limitations, which when combined with a depauperate natural enemy fauna most likely facilitated successful invasion by H. coagulata. CLIMEX predicted that cold stress accumulation would exclude Pierce's disease causing strains of X. fastidiosa from France and northern and central grape producing areas of Spain and Italy.

After &gt;2 wk, microdialysis (MD) probes were inserted into the microtubules to create focal acidosis (FA) in the awake state using mock cerebral spinal fluid (mCSF) equilibrated with 6.4% (pH = 7.3), 50% (pH = 6.5), or 80% CO2 (pH = 6.3), where MD with 50 and 80% CO2 reduces tissue pH by 0.1 and 0.18 pH unit, respectively. There were no changes in all measured variables with MD with 6.4% at single or multiple raphe sites (P &gt; 0.05). During FA at single raphe sites, only 80% CO2 elicited physiological changes as inspiratory flow was 16.9% above (P &lt; 0.05) control. However, FA with 50 and 80% CO2 at multiple sites increased (P &lt; 0.05) inspiratory flow by 18.4 and 30.1%, respectively, where 80% CO2 also increased (P &lt; 0.05) tidal volume, heart rate, CO2 production, and O2 consumption. FA with 80% CO2 at multiple raphe sites also led to hyperventilation (-2 mmHg), indicating that FA had effects on breathing independent of an increased metabolic rate. We believe these findings suggest that the large ventilatory response to a global respiratory brain acidosis reflects the cumulative effect of stimulation at widespread chemoreceptor sites rather than a large stimulation at a single site. Additionally, focal acidification of raphe chemoreceptors appears to activate an established thermogenic response needed to offset the increased heat loss associated with the CO2 hyperpnea.","Central chemoreception; Control of breathing","carbon dioxide; acidosis; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; chemoreceptor; controlled study; female; goat; heart rate; heat loss; hyperventilation; male; metabolic rate; microdialysis; microtubule; nonhuman; oxygen consumption; pH; priority journal; respiration center; respiration control; statistical analysis; tidal volume; Acidosis, Respiratory; Animals; Carbon Dioxide; Chemoreceptors; Female; Goats; Male; Medulla Oblongata; Microdialysis; Raphe Nuclei; Respiration; Respiratory Mechanics; Rest; Wakefulness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9244258595

Through chronically implanted microtubules, 1) a focal acidosis was created by microdialysis of mock cerebrospinal fluid (mCSF), equilibrated with various levels of CO2, and 2) medullary extracellular fluid (ECF) pH was measured by using a custom-made pH electrode. Focal acidosis in the RO or RP, by dialyzing either 25 or 80% CO2 (mCSF pH ∼ 6.8 or 6.3), increased (P &lt; 0.05) inspiratory flow by 8 and 12%, respectively, while the animals were awake during the day, but not at night while they were awake or in non-rapid eye movement sleep. While the animals were awake during the day, there were also increases in heart rate and blood pressure (P &lt; 0.05) but no significant change in metabolic rate or arterial PCO2. Dialysis with mCSF equilibrated with 25 or 80% CO2 reduced ECF pH by the same amount (25%) or three times more (80%) than when inspired CO2 was increased to 7%. During CO2 inhalation, the reduction in ECF pH was only 50% of the reduction in arterial pH. Finally, dialysis in vivo only decreased ECF pH by 19.1% of the change during dialysis in an in vitro system. We conclude that 1) the physiological responses to focal acidosis in the RO and RP are consistent with the existence of chemoreceptors in these nuclei, and 2) local pH buffering mechanisms act to minimize changes in brain pH during systemic induced acidosis and microdialysis focal acidosis and that these mechanisms could be as or more important to pH regulation than the small changes in inspiratory flow during a focal acidosis.","Central chemoreceptors; Control of breathing; pH regulation","acidification; acidosis; adolescent; animal experiment; article; blood pressure; brain stem; breathing; carbon dioxide tension; cerebrospinal fluid; controlled study; extracellular fluid; goat; heart rate; lung ventilation; metabolic rate; microdialysis; microtubule; nonhuman; pH; priority journal; raphe nucleus; raphe pallidus; respiration control; sleep; wakefulness; Acidosis; Administration, Inhalation; Animals; Blood Pressure; Brain Diseases; Buffers; Carbon Dioxide; Extracellular Fluid; Goats; Heart Rate; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Medulla Oblongata; Microdialysis; Raphe Nuclei; Respiration; Sleep; Wakefulness",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342618889

Vehicle energy consumption and the urban air quality at street level, related to location and design of parking establishments, need to be assessed and quantified. In addition, the indoor parking environment needs attention. This paper gives a description of a methodological approach when comparing different parking establishments. The paper also briefly describes a Swedish attempt to create methods and models for assessing and quantifying such problem. The models are the macrolevel model BRAHE, for regional traffic exhaust emission, and the micromodel SimPark, a parking search model attempt combined with emission models. Until now, very limited knowledge exists regarding the various aspects of vehicle parking and environmental effects in the technical field as well as in the social and human behaviour aspects. This requires an interdisciplinary approach to this challenging area for research, development and more directly practically implemented surveys and field studies. In order to illustrate the new evaluation methodology, the paper also contains some results from a pilot study in Stockholm. Given certain assumptions, a study of vehicle emissions from parking in an underground garage compared with kerbside parking has given an emission reduction of about 40% in favour of the parking garage.

Estimates of future emissions of greenhouse gases and ozone precursors are based on the A2 scenario developed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), one of the scenarios with the highest growth Of CO2 among all IPCC scenarios. Simulation results for five summers in the 2020s, 2050s, and 2080s indicate that summertime average daily maximum 8-hour O3 concentrations increase by 2.7, 4.2, and 5.0 ppb, respectively, as a result of regional climate change alone with respect to five summers in the 1990s. Through additional sensitivity simulations for the five summers in the 2050s the relative: impact of changes in regional climate, anthropogenic emissions within the modeling domain, and changed boundary conditions approximating possible changes of global atmospheric composition was investigated. Changed boundary conditions are found to be the largest contributor to changes in predicted summertime average daily maximum 8-hour O3 concentrations (5.0 ppb), followed by the effects of regional climate change (4.2 ppb) and the effects of increased anthropogenic emissions (1.3 ppb). However, when changes in the fourth highest summertime 8-hour O3 concentration are considered, changes in regional climate are the most important contributor to simulated concentration changes (7.6 ppb), followed by the effect of increased anthropogenic emissions (3.9 ppb) and increased boundary conditions (2.8 ppb). Thus, while previous studies have pointed out the potentially important contribution of growing global emissions and intercontinental transport to O3 air quality in the United States for future decades, the results presented here imply that it may be equally important to consider the effects of a changing climate when planning for the future attainment of regional-scale air quality standards such as the U.S. national ambient air quality standard that is based on the fourth highest annual daily maximum 8-hour O3 concentration.

The summer 2001 urban campaign in Queens, NY, and the summer 2002 rural campaign in upstate New York (Whiteface Mountain) hosted an operation of an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer, Ambient Particulate Sulfate and Nitrate Monitors, a Continuous Ambient Sulfate Monitor, and a Particle-Into-Liquid Sampler with Ion Chromato-graphs (PILS-IC).

In the first stage, a linear regression model is used to estimate site-specific trends in data adjusted for the effects of season and meteorology. In the second stage, kriging methodology based on maximum likelihood estimation is used to estimate regional trends and standard errors. The method is extended to include a Bayesian analysis to account for the uncertainty in estimating the spatial covariance parameters. For both pollutants, significant improvement in air quality was detected that appears similar to the large drop in SO2 power plant emissions. Spatial patterns of trends in SO2 and SO42- concentrations vary by location over the eastern US. For SO2, trends at monitoring sites in the Midwest and Mid-Atlantic were in the -30% to -42% range with smaller changes in the South. Across most of the US, trends in SO42- were smaller than for SO2. Both spatial prediction techniques produced similar results in terms of regional trends and standard errors.","Bayesian methods; CASTNet; Clean Air Act Amendments; Kriging","Air pollution; Fossil fuel power plants; Mathematical models; Meteorology; Regression analysis; Sulfur dioxide; Pollutants; Standard errors; Earth atmosphere; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; Bayesian analysis; sulfur dioxide; trend analysis; air; article; atmosphere; covariance; electric power plant; linear regression analysis; meteorology; priority journal; rural area; season; statistical model; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442263980

These mutations resulted in the loss of AhR binding to endogenous XAP2 in COS-1 cells and reduced binding of exogenously expressed XAP2. Cellular localization of the mutant AhR-yellow fluorescent protein fusion proteins remained nuclear when XAP2 was co-expressed, while the nonmutant receptor was redistributed to the cytoplasm. XAP2 expression caused an overall repression of constitutive and ligand-induced AhR transcriptional activity. However, increased expression of XAP2 had no effect on the AhRY408A mutant transcriptional activity. Additionally the XAP2 binding-deficient AhR mutants showed overall higher transcriptional activity when compared with the non-mutant receptor. Interestingly reduced incorporation of the Hsp90 associated co-chaperone p23 in the unliganded AhR complex was observed with increasing XAP2 expression. The displacement of p23 from Hsp90 did not occur when increasing levels of XAP2 were introduced in COS-1 cells in the absence of the AhR; thus this displacement event occurs specifically within an AhR complex. Finally XAP2 itself was capable of existing in multimeric complexes, and these complexes did not require Hsp90 or AhR to form. However, it is not yet clear whether XAP2 can exist within the AhR complex in more than one copy.",,"Aromatic hydrocarbons; Binding energy; Complexation; Fusion reactions; Growth kinetics; Mutagenesis; Proteins; Hydrocarbon receptors; Mutation; Transcriptional regulators; Biochemistry; alanine; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; chaperone; heat shock protein 90; hybrid protein; lysine; protein p23; protein XAP2; tyrosine; unclassified drug; yellow fluorescent protein; amino acid substitution; animal cell; article; binding affinity; cell strain COS1; complex formation; controlled study; Hepatitis B virus; mouse; nonhuman; point mutation; priority journal; protein binding; protein expression; protein localization; receptor intrinsic activity; Animals; COS Cells; HSP90 Heat-Shock Proteins; Humans; Molecular Chaperones; Phosphoproteins; Proteins; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; Tetrachlorodibenzodioxin; Transcription, Genetic; Animalia; Hepatitis B virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8544259620

Since the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began widespread monitoring of PM2.5 levels in 1999, the epidemiologic community has performed numerous observational studies modeling mortality and morbidity responses to PM2.5 levels using Poisson generalized additive models (GAMs). Although these models are useful for relating ambient PM2.5 levels to mortality, they cannot directly measure the strength of the effect of exposure to PM2.5 on mortality. In order to assess this effect, we propose a three-stage Bayesian hierarchical model as an alternative to the classical Poisson GAM. Fitting our model to data collected in seven North Carolina counties from 1999 through 2001, we found that an increase in PM2.5 exposure is linked to increased risk of cardiovascular mortality in the same day and next 2 days. Specifically, a 10-μg/m3 increase in average PM2.5 exposure is associated with a 2.5% increase in the relative risk of current-day cardiovascular mortality, a 4.0% increase in the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality the next day, and an 11.4% increase in the relative risk of cardiovascular mortality 2 days later. Because of the small sample size of our study, only the third effect was found to have &gt; 95% posterior probability of being &gt; 0. In addition, we compared the results obtained from our model to those obtained by applying frequentist (or classical, repeated sampling-based) and Bayesian versions of the classical Poisson GAM to our study population.","Exposure simulator; Fine particulate matter; SHEDS-PM; Spatial modeling; Stochastic Human Exposure and Dose Simulation","article; atmosphere; Bayes theorem; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular risk; controlled study; environmental exposure; environmental monitoring; health hazard; human; information processing; mathematical model; morbidity; mortality; observation; particle size; particulate matter; Poisson distribution; priority journal; probability; risk assessment; sample size; United States; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Air Pollutants; Bayes Theorem; Cardiovascular Diseases; Child; Child, Preschool; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Mortality; North Carolina; Particle Size; Risk Assessment; Sample Size",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644316720

In this study a mechanical mixture of CoFER and HZSM-5 zeolites was studied as a dual pore system catalyst for the continuous lean reduction of NOx with isobutane as reducing agent. The degree of NOx conversion was found to be strongly dependent on the oxygen concentration in the gas mixture, and the highest degree of reduction was achieved with 10% O2. This optimum is explained by the need for NO2 as an intermediate for the catalyst to work efficiently, and that above a certain oxygen concentration O2 oxidises the hydrocarbon resulting in a lower reduction potential for NOx. At an operating temperature of 350°C the conversion of NOx to N2 was 52% under steady-state conditions, but the efficiency can be improved further by optimisation of the oxidising zeolite and of the mixing ratio of the two zeolites. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, real-time particle number concentrations measured on a nominal 5 s average basis using an electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI) for these two bus technologies are compared to that of a baseline catalyst-equipped diesel bus operated on ultralow sulfur fuel (BASE) using dynamometer testing. Particle emissions were consistently 2 orders of magnitude lower for the CNG and TRAP compared to BASE on all driving cycles. Time-resolved total particle numbers were examined in terms of sampling factors identified as affecting the ability of ELPI to quantify the particulate matter number emissions for low-emitting vehicles such as CNG and TRAP as a function of vehicle driving mode. Key factors were instrument sensitivity and dilution ratio, alignment of particle and vehicle operating data, sampling train background particles, and cycle-to-cycle variability due to vehicle, engine, after-treatment, or driver behavior. In-cycle variability on the central business district (CBD) cycle was highest for the TRAP configuration, but this could not be attributed to the ELPI sensitivity issues observed for TRAP-IDLE measurements. Elevated TRAP emissions coincided with low exhaust temperature, suggesting on-road real-world particulate filter performance can be evaluated by monitoring exhaust temperature. Nonunique particle emission maps indicate that measures other than vehicle speed and acceleration are necessary to model disaggregated real-time particle emissions. Further testing on a wide variety of test cycles is needed to evaluate the relative importance of the time history of vehicle operation and the hysteresis of the sampling train/dilution tunnel on ultrafine particle emissions. Future studies should monitor particle emissions with high-resolution real-time instruments and account for the operating regime of the vehicle using time-series analysis to develop predictive number emissions models.",,"Diesel fuels; Dynamometers; Exhaust gases; Particulate emissions; Time series analysis; Particulate matters; Natural gas; diesel fuel; fuel; natural gas; ultralow sulfur fuel; unclassified drug; anthropogenic source; exhaust emission; traffic emission; air pollution indicator; air sampling; article; dynamometry; electrical low pressure impactor; exhaust gas; filter; hypobarism; motor vehicle; particle number modal analysis; particle size; sensitivity analysis; Automobile Driving; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Particle Size; Reproducibility of Results; Transportation; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842732245

The object of this study is a municipality, Skövde, which is planning to build a waste incineration plant to produce electricity and heat. The municipality is also planning to extend the district heating grid to include a large industrial heat consumer. The economic effect on the energy system of these measures is analysed as well as environmental effects in terms of carbon dioxide emissions. The consequences of two different policy instruments, green electricity certificates and a tax on waste incineration, are also studied. Economic optimisations show that the advantage of co-operation with industry is twofold: lower heat production costs and a considerable reduction of carbon dioxide emissions. It is economically feasible to invest in a waste incineration plant for heat production. An important measure to lower carbon dioxide emissions is to introduce combined heat and power production on the assumption that locally produced electricity replaces electricity produced by coal condensing power. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, the question remains as to how these stem cells are activated and led to the liver and where the signals initiating the mechanisms of activation and differentiation of stem cells originate. The aim of this study was to investigate the influence of serum from liver-damaged rats on differentiation tendency of bone marrow-derived stem cells. Methods: Serum samples were collected from rats treated with a 2-acetylaminofluorene (2-AAF) /carbon tetrachloride (CCI4) program for varying time points and then used as stimulators of cultured BM stem cells. Expression of M2- and L-type isozymes of rat pyruvate kinase, albumin as well as integrin-β1 were then examined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to estimate the differentiation state of BM stem cells. Results: Expression of M2-type isozyme of pyruvate kinase (M2-PK), a marker of immature hepatocytes, was detected in each group stimulated with experimental serum, but not in controls including mature hepatocytes, BM stem cells without serum stimulation, and BM stem cells stimulated with normal control serum. As a marker expressed in the development of liver, the expression signal of integrin-β1 was also detectable in each group stimulated with experimental serum. However, expression of L-type isozyme of pyruvate kinase (L-PK) and albumin, marker molecules of mature hepatocytes, was not detected in groups stimulated with experimental serum. Conclusion: Under the influence of serum from rats with liver failure, BM stem cells begin to differentiate along a direction to hepatocyte lineage and to possess some features of immature hepatocytes.

In the Weddell Sea interior, full remineralization of the export production occurs at shallow depths. This shallow, CO2-charged water stands in isopycnal contact with the abyssal world ocean waters to the north of the subpolar Weddell Sea. Via isopycnal water transport, remineralized CO 2 is transferred and sequestered in the deep sea. The amount involved is 1.9×1013gC yr-1, which is equal to at least 6% of the presently estimated world-wide natural CO2 sequestration in the abyssal oceans. It thus constitutes an important component of the lower limb of the global oceanic carbon cycle. There may be more regions like the Weddell Sea, where this mechanism could be active. It is likely to play a significant role on the glacial-interglacial time scale. During a glacial period, reduced CO2 transport via the CIW would tend to increase the atmospheric partial pressure of CO2 as opposed to the generally decreasing pCO2 trend. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Phospholipid fatty acid analysis revealed that approximately 104-105 viable cells per gram of dry rock are extant, and water availability was shown to be the primary factor limiting microbial growth in situ. Phosphate and carbon limitation, however, also suppress final cell densities by at least one order of magnitude under saturated conditions. Despite these limiting factors, significant growth of aerobic chemoheterotrophic microorganisms was shown to occur in unconcentrated simulated groundwater with or without addition of a reduced carbon source (7 × 107 and 8 × 106 planktonic cells/mL, respectively), indicating that when water becomes available in the repository environment, microbial growth will ensue. Organisms that were isolated from stationary cultures grown from Yucca Mountain rock in concentrated and unconcentrated simulated groundwaters showed significant 16S rDNA sequence divergence from reference organisms. Different (but related) organisms were isolated from concentrated and unconcentrated groundwater-grown cultures. Generally, as experimental conditions approached those expected to be encountered in situ, the organisms isolated were more divergent from reference organisms. Organisms that were isolated have metabolic properties that could allow them to be active and grow within the repository environment if water availability is sufficient.

This study investigated the effect of reducing both the nicotinamide dose and carbogen CO2 content on radiation response. Materials and methods A C3H mouse mammary carcinoma grown in the right rear foot of female CDF1 was used and treated when at 200 mm3. Nicotinamide was intraperitoneally injected 20 min prior to irradiation. Carbogen (CO2 content of either 2 or 5%, balance O2) breathing was started 5 min before, and continued during, additional treatments. Radiation was given locally to tissues of restrained non-anaesthetised mice either as a single or fractionated (10 fractions in 12 days) schedule. The endpoints were local tumour control at 90 days, development of moist desquamation 11-23 days after treatment of normal foot skin, or tumour oxygenation measured with the Eppendorf electrode. Results The TCD50 values in this tumour following single or fractionated radiation treatment were 52 and 71Gy, respectively. Carbogen (5% CO2 content) breathing with every radiation treatment in the fractionated schedule significantly (Chi-squared test; P&lt;0.05) enhanced radiation response (ER 1.25). Significant enhancements were also seen with nicotinamide given either as 10×120 mg/kg (ER 1.25), 6×120 mg/kg (ER 1.11) or 10×90 mg/kg (ER 1.18), although the 6×120 schedule was significantly less effective than 10×120. Combining nicotinamide with carbogen resulted in ERs of 1.39-1.44, and these were independent of the nicotinamide treatments. There was also no significant difference in the enhancement of tumour radiation response or improved tumour oxygenation status if the CO2 content of the gas breathing was varied from 0% (i.e. 100% O2) to 2 or 5% (balance O2), although a CO2 content of 2% did give a smaller enhancement of radiation-induced normal skin damage than 5%. Conclusions Both the nicotinamide dose, but not the frequency, and carbogen CO2 content may be reduced in patients experience intolerance without any significant loss of sensitisation. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The distributions of ranks among the municipalities in the same climate zone were very similar, indicating that this ranking scheme is a good indicator of winter severity in terms of climate zones. Municipalities that require modified disaster prevention planning for winter months can use the quantified winter severity proposed by this scheme as a guide, and the ranking scheme can also be used to modify disaster plans on a daily basis depending on daily ranking.

Using a coupled climate model, the Parallel Climate Model (PCM), regional responses of the THC in the North Atlantic to increased C02 and the underlying physical processes are studied here. The Atlantic THC shows a 20-yr cycle in the control run, qualitatively agreeing with other modeling results. Compared with the control run, the simulated maximum of the Atlantic THC weakens by about 5 Sv (1 Sv 106 M3 S-1) Or 14% in an ensemble of transient experiments with a 1% C02 increase per year at the time of C02 doubling. The weakening of the THC is accompanied by reduced poleward heat transport in the midlatitude North Atlantic. Analyses show that oceanic deep convective activity strengthens significantly in the Greenland-Iceland-Norway (GIN) Seas owing to a saltier (denser) upper ocean, but weakens in the abrador Sea due to a fresher (lighter) upper ocean and in the south of the Denmark Strait region (SDSR) because of surface warming. The saltiness of the GIN Seas are mainly caused by an increased salty North Atlantic inflow, and reduced sea ice volume fluxes from the Arctic into this region. The warmer SDSR is induced by a reduced heat loss to the atmosphere, and a reduced sea ice flux into this region, resulting in less heat being used to melt ice. Thus, sea ice-related salinity effect s appear to be more important in the GIN Seas, but sea ice-melt-related thermal effects seem to be more important in the SDSR region. On the other hand, the fresher Labrador Sea is mainly attributed to increased precipitation. These regional changes produce the overall weakening of the THC in the Labrador Sea and SDSR, and more vigorous ocean overturning in the GIN Seas. The northward heat transport south of 60°N is reduced with increased CO2 but increased north of 60°N due to the increased flow of North Atlantic water across this latitude. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Heat losses; Heat transfer; Thermal effects; Future climate regimes; Surface warming; Earth atmosphere; atmosphere-ocean coupling; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate modeling; salinity; thermohaline circulation; Atlantic Ocean; oceanic regions; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2042475909

Our objectives in this study were to evaluate the watershed scale effects of understory burning on total aboveground biomass, and the carbon and nitrogen pools in coarse woody debris (CWD), forest floor and soils. We also evaluated the effects of burning on three key biogeochemical fluxes; litterfall, soil CO2 flux and soil net nitrogen mineralization. We found burning significantly reduced understory biomass as well as the carbon and nitrogen pools in CWD, small wood and litter. There was no significant loss of carbon and nitrogen from the fermentation, humus and soil layer probably as the result of low fire intensity. Burning resulted in a total net loss of 55kgha-1 nitrogen from the wood and litter layers, which should be easily replaced by future atmospheric deposition. We found a small reduction in soil CO2 flux immediately following the burn but litterfall and net nitrogen mineralization were not significantly different from controls throughout the growing season following the burn. Overall, the effects of burning on the ecosystem processes we measured were small, suggesting that prescribed burning may be an effective management tool for restoring oak-pine ecosystems in the southern Appalachians.","Coarse woody debris; Litter; Prescribed fire; Soil CO2","Biomass; Carbon; Combustion; Ecology; Ecosystems; Nitrogen; Soils; Forest communities; Oak-pine forests; Forestry; coarse woody debris; forest management; prescribed burning; restoration ecology; soil carbon; understory; Appalachians; North America; Quercus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542379970

However, our understanding of mechanistic controls of soil CO2 production and transport is greatly limited. A multilayer process-based soil CO2 efflux model (PATCIS) was used to evaluate soil CO2 production and transport in the Duke Forest. CO2 production in the soil is the sum of root respiration and soil microbial respiration, and CO2 transport in the soil mainly simulates gaseous diffusion. Simulated soil CO2 efflux in the Duke Forest ranged from 5 g CO2 m-2 d-1 in the winter to 25 g CO2 m-2 d-1 in summer. Annual soil CO2 efflux was 997 and 1211 g C m-2 yr-1 in 1997 and 1998, respectively. These simulations were consistent with the observed soil CO2 efflux. Simulated root respiration contributed 53% to total soil respiration. Soil temperature had the dominant influence on soil CO2 production and CO2 efflux while soil moisture only regulated soil CO2 efflux in the summer when soil moisture was very low. Soil CO2 efflux was sensitive to the specific fine root respiratory rate and live fine root biomass. Elevated CO2 increased annual soil CO2 efflux by 26% in 1997 and 18% in 1998, due mainly to the enhanced live fine root biomass and litterfall. On a daily to yearly basis, CO2 production is almost identical to CO2 efflux, suggesting that CO2 transport is nota critical process regulating daily and long-term soil surface CO2 effluxes in the Duke Forest. We also developed a statistical model of soil CO2 efflux with soil temperature and moisture. Daily soil CO2 efflux estimation by the statistical model showed a similar pattern to the simulated soil CO2 efflux, but the total annual CO2 efflux was slightly lower. While the statistical model is simple, yet powerful, in simulating seasonal dynamics of soil CO2 efflux, the process-based model has the potential to advance our mechanistic understanding of soil CO2 efflux variations in the current and future worlds.

Herbivory on a dominant plant can alter competitive interactions, which may have profound effects on plant community composition. We investigated the impact of herbivory by a root weevil (Hylobius transversovittatus) and a leaf beetle (Galerucella calmariensis) on purple loosestrife (Lythrum salicaria) in large walk-in cages established in an invaded wetland in upstate New York, USA, from 1997 to 2000. We monitored how herbivory affected L. salicaria performance (growth and biomass allocation), litter dynamics, plant community composition, and changes in canopy temperature, humidity, and the amount of light penetrating through the canopy. Leaf herbivory had the greatest effect, reducing the height of L. salicaria shoots, reproductive effort, and aboveground biomass. Root herbivory also reduced L. salicaria leaf, stem, and inflorescence biomass and the number of stems but did not affect shoot height. Both root and leaf herbivore damage to L. salicaria resulted in increased light availability within the canopy but had no effect on canopy temperature or humidity. Whereas existing wetland plants grew larger in plots where L. salicaria was damaged by leaf herbivores, plant species richness did not vary among treatments. Leaf herbivory also accelerated decomposition of L. salicaria leaves and stems. Leaf and root herbivory did not interact, suggesting that (1) beetles did not compete for resources via their shared host plants and (2) attack by multiple herbivores did not increase or accelerate herbivore impact on L. salicaria over our four-year study. Our results show that the competitive dominance of L. salicaria in North American wetlands can be curtailed by herbivores introduced as biological control agents, but it also demonstrates the need for long-term investigations to capture cumulative herbivore impacts on plant individuals and communities.","Biological control; Combined effects of herbivory; Competition; Galerucella calmariensis; Hylobius transversovittatus; Leaf herbivory; Litter decomposition; Lythrum salicaria; Root herbivory; Species richness; Wetland","biological control; biological invasion; competition (ecology); plant community; plant-herbivore interaction; restoration ecology; root system; wetland; New York [United States]; North America; United States; Animalia; Chrysomelidae; Chrysomelidae; Coleoptera; Coleoptera; Curculionidae; Curculionidae; Galerucella; Galerucella calmariensis; Galerucella calmariensis; Hylobius; Hylobius transversovittatus; Lysimachia; Lythraceae; Lythrum; Lythrum salicaria; Lythrum salicaria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6344278522

SO4 concentrations [SO 4] were determined in individual daily samples. Continuous hourly SO2 data are also available for much of the period. [SO4] at Mayville were twice that at Whiteface Mountain, and total S (S as SO2 + SO4) burden was fourfold higher at Mayville. From 1979 through 2002, [SO4] decreased by 59% at Whiteface Mountain, and at Mayville the decrease was 30% from 1984 to 2002. From 1979 to 2002, SO2 emissions in eight states upwind of and contiguous with New York State (Ohio, Pennsylvania, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, Kentucky, West Virginia, and Ontario, Canada) decreased by 49%. A linear relationship was observed between atmospheric [SO4] and [total S] burden at the two sites with the cumulative SO2 emissions. These observations suggest that any further reductions in SO2 emissions would result in a proportional decrease in [SO4] and [total S] across New York State and possibly across the northeastern United States. The data at Whiteface Mountain suggest that beginning in 1997, the decrease in [SO4] and [total S], relative to SO 2 emissions, may be faster than the earlier period. Like [SO4] and [total S], the trace element concentrations were twofold to fivefold higher at Mayville than at Whiteface Mountain. The concentrations at both sites showed an unmistakable decrease over time. The largest decreases were observed for Hg (16%/year at Whiteface Mountain and 10%/year at Mayville) and Pb (14%year at Whiteface Mountain and 10%/year at Mayville). The remaining elements (except Sb), including the crustal elements K, Mn, Sc, and Fe, showed a decreases of 3-5%/year. Trends for Sb at Whiteface Mountain and for Mn at Mayville could not be accurately discerned, apparently due to some nearby emissions. Apparently, the reductions in the emissions Of SO, and particulate matter have also resulted in the decrease of atmospheric burden of trace elements and an improvement in air quality.

We conducted a physical and economic evaluation of the environmental and health benefits from a reduction in emissions through this mandated environmental technology against the costs, with reference to urban areas in Great Britain. We made both an ex post assessment - based on available data to 1998 - and an ex ante assessment - projected to 2005, the year when full penetration of VECs into the feet is expected. Substantial health benefits in excess of the costs of VECs were indicated: By 1998 the estimated net societal health benefits were approximately £500 million, and by 2005 they were estimated to rise to as much as, £2 billion. We also found through environmental surveys that although lead in road dust has fallen by 50% in urban areas, platinum accumulations near roads have risen significanty, up to 90-fold higher than natural background levels.

In this paper, the results of the rain forest growth model FORMIND were assessed by a multicriteria decision analysis. The main processes covered by FORMIND include tree growth, mortality, regeneration and competition. Tree growth is calculated based on a carbon balance approach. Trees compete for light and space; dying large trees fall down and create gaps in the forest. Sixty-four different logging scenarios for an initially undisturbed forest stand at Deramakot (Malaysia) were simulated. The scenarios differ regarding the logging cycle, logging method, cutting limit and logging intensity. We characterise the impacts with four criteria describing the yield, canopy opening and changes in species composition. Multicriteria decision analysis was used for the first time to evaluate the scenarios and identify the efficient ones. Our results plainly show that reduced-impact logging scenarios are more 'efficient' than the others, since in these scenarios forest damage is minimised without significantly reducing yield. Nevertheless, there is a trade-off between yield and achieving a desired ecological state of logged forest; the ecological state of the logged forests can only be improved by reducing yields and enlarging the logging cycles. Our study also demonstrates that high cutting limits or low logging intensities cannot compensate for the high level of damage caused by conventional logging techniques. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Here we describe the short-term dynamics of ecosystem physiology in experimental stands of native (Heteropogon contortus) and invasive (Eragrostis lehmanniana) grasses to an irrigation pulse across two geomorphic surfaces with distinctly different soils: a Pleistocene-aged surface with high clay content in a strongly horizonated soil, and a Holocene-aged surface with low clay content in homogenously structured soils. We evaluated whole-ecosystem and leaf-level CO2 and H2O exchange, soil CO2 efflux, along with plant and soil water status to understand potential constraints on whole-ecosystem carbon exchange during the initiation of the summer monsoon season. Prior to the irrigation pulse, both invasive and native grasses had less negative pre-dawn water potentials (Ψpd), greater leaf photosynthetic rates (Anet) and stomatal conductance (gs), and greater rates of net ecosystem carbon exchange (NEE) on the Pleistocene surface than on the Holocene. Twenty-four hours following the experimental application of a 39 mm irrigation pulse, soil CO2 efflux increased leading to all plots losing CO2 to the atmosphere over the course of a day. Invasive species stands had greater evapotranspiration rates (ET) immediately following the precipitation pulse than did native stands, while maximum instantaneous NEE increased for both species and surfaces at roughly the same rate. The differential ET patterns through time were correlated with an earlier decline in NEE in the invasive species as compared to the native species plots. Plots with invasive species accumulated between 5% and 33% of the carbon that plots with the native species accumulated over the 15-day pulse period. Taken together, these results indicate that system CO2 efflux (both the physical displacement of soil CO2 by water along with plant and microbial respiration) strongly controls whole-ecosystem carbon exchange during precipitation pulses. Since CO2 and H2O loss to the atmosphere was partially driven by species effects on soil microclimate, understanding the mechanistic relationships between the soil characteristics, plant ecophysiological responses, and canopy structural dynamics will be important for understanding the effects of shifting precipitation and vegetation patterns in semi-arid environments. © Springer-Verlag 2003.","Evapotranspiration; Invasive species; Net ecosystem exchange; Precipitation manipulation; Santa Rita Experimental Range","carbon; carbon dioxide; rain; water; evapotranspiration; grassland; invasive species; native species; net ecosystem exchange; semiarid region; soil texture; analysis of variance; article; comparative study; ecosystem; metabolism; particle size; photosynthesis; physiology; Poaceae; season; soil; sweating; time; United States; Analysis of Variance; Arizona; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Particle Size; Photosynthesis; Plant Transpiration; Poaceae; Rain; Seasons; Soil; Time Factors; Water; Eragrostis; Eragrostis lehmanniana; Heteropogon contortus; Poaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6044249165

Repeated application of these compounds to agricultural soils for many years may result in the enrichment of microorganisms capable of degrading them. In this study, a microcosm-enrichment approach was used to investigate bacterial populations that may be components of metam-sodium- and CP-degrading microorganisms in compost-amended soils. After 6 months incubation, with repeated application of metam sodium and CP, degradation was ≥70% faster in compost-manure-amended (CM) soil compared to ≤50% in the unamended soils. The accelerated fumigant degradation may have been due to the addition of compost or to the development of new microbial populations with enhanced degradation capacity. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) profiles of PCR-amplified regions of 16S rRNA genes were used to identify dominant bacterial populations responsible for the accelerated fumigant degradation. The DGGE results indicated that specific bacterial types had been enriched and these were similar to strains isolated from basal minimal media. Fragments from DGGE bands and colonies were cloned, sequenced, and compared with published 16S rRNA sequences. Cloned sequences were dominated by Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Arthrobacter, Mycobacterium and uncultured bacterial species. The addition of organic amendment to soil during fumigation practices has the potential to increase the diversity of different microbial species, thereby accelerating fumigant degradation and reducing atmospheric emissions. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"Biodegradation; Biodiversity; Crops; Electrophoresis; RNA; Soils; Atmospheric emissions; Cash crops; Chloropicrin (CP); Soil-borne pathogens; Bacteria; chloropicrin; metham sodium; RNA 16S; sodium derivative; unclassified drug; agricultural soil; biodegradation; fumigant; microbial community; addition reaction; Arthrobacter; article; atmosphere; Bacillus; bacterial strain; bacterium colony; bacterium culture; bacterium identification; bacterium isolation; compost; controlled study; culture medium; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; fragmentation reaction; gene amplification; incubation time; infection control; manure; microbial degradation; microbial population dynamics; microcosm; microflora; molecular cloning; Mycobacterium; nonhuman; polymerase chain reaction; Pseudomonas; RNA sequence; soil; Bacteria; Biodegradation, Environmental; Hydrocarbons, Chlorinated; Thiocarbamates; Bacteria; Biodegradation; Biodiversity; Electrophoresis; Farm Crops; Nucleic Acids; Pathogens; Soil; Weeds; Worms; Arthrobacter; Bacteria (microorganisms); Mycobacterium; Nematoda; Pseudomonas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11244271665

The bimetallic compounds: Pt-Rh, Rh-Au, Rh-Pd, and Pt-Pd were also investigated. Initially this work was aimed at understanding the roles of the different components of automobile catalytic converters on the reactions of ethanol, which is used as a fuel additive. Some of the catalysts that showed high activity for ethanol oxidation were also investigated for hydrogen production. The addition of any of the above metals to CeO2 was found to suppress the oxidation of ethanol to acetates at room temperature, as there are fewer surface oxygen atoms available to oxidise the ethanol (the remaining oxygen atoms did not produce efficient oxidation). Ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde was facilitated by the presence of Pt or Pd; at higher temperatures the acetaldehyde condensed to other organic compounds, such as crotonaldehyde. By contrast, in the presence of Rh only traces of acetaldehyde or other organic compounds were seen on the surface, and detectable amounts of CO were found upon ethanol adsorption at room temperature. This indicates the powerful nature of Rh in breaking the carbon-carbon bond in ethanol. The effects of prior reduction were also investigated and clear differences were seen: for example, a shift in reaction selectivity is observed for the bimetallic Rh-containing catalysts. Methane was the dominant hydrocarbon on the reduced catalysts while acetaldehyde was the main product for the non-reduced ones. Hydrogen formation was monitored during steady state ethanol oxidation and Pt-Rh and Rh-Au were found to be the most active catalysts.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Catalysts; Catalytic converters; Cerium compounds; Coal gasification; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; Liquefied petroleum gas; Natural gas; Organic compounds; Oxidation; Precious metals; Acetaldehyde; Carbon-carbon bonds; Partial oxidation; Ethanol",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9644291633

This study attempts to estimate the emission reductions of major air pollutants (NOx, PM, HC and CO2) that might be expected from the introduction of alternative fuels and technologies in London by the year 2020. A number of alternative scenarios for the road transport system have been developed, and their corresponding emissions compared to those arising from a baseline scenario, consisting exclusively of conventional fuels and engines. The results confirmed that by 2020 the emissions of NOx, PM and HC from a conventional vehicle fleet would be greatly decreased as a result of more stringent vehicle emission standards. Significant additional improvements could be achieved by the introduction of hydrogen-fuel cell vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, natural gas and biofuels. It was found that the emissions of the principal pollutants of concern in London, NOx and PM10, show similar patterns of reduction. The results also imply that the anticipated increase in conventional vehicle efficiency would only deliver a minimal 2 percent reduction in CO2 vehicle emissions relative to the present, but greater reductions were achieved in all the alternative scenarios. © Imperial College Press.","Air pollution; Alternative fuels; Emission inventories; Greenhouse gases; New vehicle technologies; Urban air quality","alternative fuel; emission control; technological development; traffic emission; urban transport; England; Eurasia; Europe; London [England]; United Kingdom; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4744359676

The activity for NO reduction increased as the oxygen-content in the reaction mixture increased from 2% to 10%. The influence of Ag loading, the catalytic support used and the type of the reductant on NO reduction was examined. Moderate silver loadings (3%) exhibit the most efficient deNOx activity, while increasing the metal loading or using a Ce-promoted alumina support inhibits the catalytic activity. Among C3 H6, CH4 and CO used as reducing agents, C3H6 has the higher reducing activity. C2 H4, C2H6, C3H8, C4H10, 1-C4H8 and 1,3- C4H6 were also tested as reducing agents, suggesting that use of higher and less saturated hydrocarbons results in an enhanced deNOx performance. Higher concentrations of the optimum reductant (1-C4H8) significantly improved the deNOx performance, achieving over 80% NOx reduction and an interestingly broad active temperature window (300-550 °C). NOx is reduced by reacting with intermediates generated from partial oxidation of hydrocarbons used as reductants. Increased availability of these species either by more C atoms in higher hydrocarbons, their easier formation from less saturated hydrocarbons or higher reductant concentration explains the improvement of NOx reduction. The performance of Ag catalysts was linked with the formation of different crystal phases, which are stabilized through a strong interaction with the alumina support. Existence of Ag in oxidation state +1 seems to be the active phase that favors most the NO reduction. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Our results show that urbanization is taking place on the most fertile lands and hence has a disproportionately large overall negative impact on NPP. Urban land transformation in the US has reduced the amount of carbon fixed through photosynthesis by 0.04 pg per year or 1.6% of the pre-urban input. The reduction is enough to offset the 1.8% gain made by the conversion of land to agricultural use, even though urbanization covers an area less than 3% of the land surface in the US and agricultural lands approach 29% of the total land area. At local and regional scales, urbanization increases NPP in resource-limited regions and through localized warming ""urban heat"" contributes to the extension of the growing season in cold regions. In terms of biologically available energy, the loss of NPP due to urbanization of agricultural lands alone is equivalent to the caloric requirement of 16.5 million people, or about 6% of the US population. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

On the other hand, the PA spectra between 800 nm and 1000 nm were almost flat, and these are expected to be dominated by light scattering effects. The PA spectra were normalized by using the Co2+ absorption peaks in order to compare the sample size and the PA signals intensity, and the sintering temperature dependence of the PA spectra is discussed. The PA signal intensity decreased with the increase of the sintering temperature. The decrease of the PA spectra seems to be caused by small light scattering effects for the large clusters under higher temperature sintering, where the grains and clusters size increase.

In particular, an extension of the familiar heat loss and radiation gain factors (U and g values respectively) has been employed to take account of the energy transfer to the facade ventilation air. In total, four terms describing ventilation gains and transmission losses in terms of irradiance and temperature components are defined which characterise the performance of the facade in total. Steady state analysis has been applied in order to express these four parameters in terms of the detailed heat transfer process within the facade. This approach has been applied to the ventilated PV facade of the public library at Mataró, Spain. Monthly U and g values have been derived and the associated thermal energy gains calculated for various climates. An alternative, simpler approach views the ventilated façade as a single solar air collector. The applicability of the standard expression for solar collector efficiency has been investigated through examination of the Mataró data. Summer and winter energy yield calculations carried out on this basis have been compared to the four parameter approach. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Both theory and practice are dominated by ambivalence about the idea of participation itself. Both struggle with dilemmas that make the problems seem insoluble, such as the conflict between the individual and collective interest or between the ideal of democracy and the reality that many voices are never heard. Cases are used to draw on an emerging set of practices of collaborative public engagement from around the world to demonstrate how alternative methods can better meet public participation goals and how they make moot most of the dilemmas of more conventional practice. Research shows that collaborative participation can solve complex, contentious problems such as budget decision making and create an improved climate for future action when bitter disputes divide a community. Authentic dialogue, networks and institutional capacity are the key elements. The authors propose that participation should be understood as a multi-way set of interactions among citizens and other players who together produce outcomes. Next steps involve developing an alternative practice framework, creating forums and arenas, adapting agency decision processes, and providing training and financial support. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Ltd.",,"local participation; participatory approach; planning practice; strategic approach",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11844307186

To evaluate the impacts of new policy measures, tools need to be available that assess the potential benefits of these measures in terms of the vehicle fleet, fuel choice, modal choice, kilometers driven, emissions, and the impacts on public health and related external costs. The ExternE accounting framework offers the most up to date and comprehensive methodology to assess marginal external costs of energy-related pollutants. It combines emission models, air dispersion models at local and regional scales with dose-response functions and valuation rules. Vito has extended this accounting framework with data and models related to the future composition of the vehicle fleet and transportation demand to evaluate the impact of new policy proposals on air quality and aggregated (total) external costs by 2010. Special attention was given to uncertainty analysis. The uncertainty for more than 100 different parameters was combined in Monte Carlo simulations to assess the range of possible outcomes and the main drivers of these results. Although the impacts from emission standards and total fleet mileage look dominant at first, a number of other factors were found to be important as well.

The need to conform to ever more stringent emissions legislation, reduced levels of carbon dioxide (CO2), and the recently introduced Renewables Obligations Certificates (ROCs) means that conventional power stations are having to change their operating philosophy and encompass new technologies and operating techniques. The current paper describes some of the key work associated with the feasibility, design, and construction stages of a 100,000tonne/annum dried sewage sludge co-firing facility attached to an existing 2,400MWe pf-fired power station. The scheme is one of the first of its type and the largest in the UK, and represents an important milestone in the complex progress of integrating a biomass fuel with a conventional boiler process. Critical steps in the initial feasibility phase of the design process are described, such as the detailed evaluation of the raw materials suitability for co-firing in terms of the chemical and physical properties of the waste fuel. The resultant raw material properties are presented as input data to a detailed computer model developed by Sinclair Knight Merz (Europe) Ltd, the output of which indicates the co-firing potential of the composite fuel with respect to its impact on plant efficiency, thermal balance, flue gas characteristics, system performance (throughput, materials and maintenance) and potential for environmental impact. Specific areas of interest are highlighted such as fuel volatility, emission levels, trace element partitioning, ash composition and behaviour, fouling and slagging mechanisms and predicted erosion and corrosion levels. Consenting requirements of the co-firing schemes have also been considered, with the Integrated Pollution Control (IPC), Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC), Town and Country Planning and the Electricity Act (Section 36 Consent) being examined. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The outcome has been the government's Vehicle Fleet Emissions Control Strategy (VFECS). This is a programme of measures designed to assist with the improvement in local air quality, and especially in the appropriate management of transport sector emissions. Key to the VFECS has been the development of tools to assess and predict the contribution of vehicle emissions to local air pollution, in a given urban situation. Determining how vehicles behave as an emissions source, and more importantly, how the combined traffic flows contribute to the total emissions within a given airshed location was an important element of the programme. The actual emissions output of a vehicle is more than that determined by a certified emission standard, at the point of manufacture. It is the engine technology's general performance capability, in conjunction with the local driving conditions, that determines its actual emissions output. As vehicles are a mobile emissions source, to understand the effect of vehicle technology, it is necessary to work with the average fleet performance, or ""fleet-weighted average emissions rate"". This is the unit measure of performance of the general traffic flow that could be passing through a given road corridor or network, as an average, over time. The flow composition can be representative of the national fleet population, but also may feature particular vehicle types in a given locality, thereby have a different emissions 'signature'. A summary of the range of work that has been completed as part of the VFECS programme is provided. The NZ Vehicle Fleet Emissions Model and the derived data set available in the NZ Traffic Emission Rates provide a significant step forward in the consistent analysis of practical, sustainable vehicle emissions policy and air-quality management in New Zealand. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Natural leachate from a local municipal landfill, amended with acetic acid, was fed to two sand-packed columns operated in upflow mode. Degradation of the influent acetic acid resulted in the production of methane and carbon dioxide, and simultaneous reduction of manganese, iron, and sulphate. Subsequent increase in the influent acetic acid concentration from 1750 to 2900mg/l, and then to 5100mg/l, led to rapid increase in the dissolved inorganic carbon, solution pH, and soil-attached biomass concentration at the column inlet, which promoted the precipitation of Mn2+ and Ca2+ as carbonate, and Fe 2+ as sulphide. An influent acetic acid concentration of 1750mg/l decreased the soil's hydraulic conductivity from an initial value of 8.8×10-3cm/s to approximately 7×10-5cm/s in the 2-6cm section of the column. Increasing the influent acetic acid to 5100mg/l only further decreased the hydraulic conductivity to 3.6×10 -5cm/s; rather, the primary effect was to increase the length of the zone experiencing reduced hydraulic conductivity from 0-6cm to the entire column. As bioaccumulation was limited to the 0-5cm section of the column, and the effect of metal precipitation was negligible, the reduction on the deeper sections of the column is attributed to gas flow, which was up to 1440ml/day. Mathematical modelling shows that biomass accumulation and gas formation were equally significant in reducing the hydraulic conductivity, while metal precipitation contributed only up to 4% of the observed reduction. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Public interest in new renewable energy technologies (RETs) emerged and grew during the oil shocks of the 1970s and early 1980s. Even though many Canadian provinces had been deriving most of their electricity from hydroelectric power, the first oil crises of the 1970s ignited a strong interest in all forms of renewable energy. Though Canada has huge prospects for low-impact RETs, it is falling behind most industrialized nations in the expansion of these technologies due to a lack of supporting market structures and the absence of appropriate government policies and initiatives. This review focuses on only applications of low-impact emerging RETs that refer to wind, solar, small hydro, geothermal, marine and modern biomass energy. Today, these technologies are mostly in the dissemination, demonstration and early stage of commercialization phase in Canada and currently they contribute less than 1% of the total primary energy consumption. It is evident from the past experience of Europe and Japan that environmentally benign RETs can contribute significantly toward Canada's Kyoto target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by displacing the use of conventional fossil fuels, and help Canada take an essential step toward a sustainable energy future. In this paper, the current energy utilization scenario of Canada has been analyzed and an array of emerging RET applications has been presented under the category of: (i) green power technologies; (ii) green heat technologies; and (iii) green fuel technologies. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

We define NFM as volatile metal compounds and metal compounds in the nucleation and accumulation modes (&lt;0.2μm). Fifty-seven NFM samples were collected between September 2000 and August 2001, and five metals (Mg, Al, Cu, Sr and Ba) were detected in most samples during the campaign. Elevated atmospheric concentrations of Mg, Cu, Sr and Ba were detected in midsummer. Since the UV-oxidisable fraction was dominant, and high enrichment factors (EFcrust) were found for these metals, it is suggested that natural emission of organometals or reduced metals, were responsible for the high concentrations observed. Several elevated concentrations of Al and Sr as NFM were discovered in their annual profiles and these are attributed mainly to inorganic or oxidised metals associated with ultra-fine particulates. In summer Mg, Cu, Sr and Ba as NFM concentrations were 3-15 times higher than when associated with particulate matter (PM 10). The emissions from automobile and seawater samples do not appear to be NFM emission sources, however, wet soils and dry soils were probably the sources of Mg+Ba and Al+Sr, respectively. Overall it is believed that metals released by natural sources were responsible for at least some of the metals detected, although a contribution from urban sources is possible. Our observations imply that atmospheric volatile and ultra-fine particulate metals cannot be ignored in the estimation of global metal circulation and budgets. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The aldoketo reductase (AKR) family of enzymes catalyze the reductive detoxification of various carbonyl compounds in an NADPH-dependent manner. To elucidate involvement of AKR in detoxification of endogenously produced carbonyls in the male reproductive system, we investigated the differential expression and tissue localization of aldehyde reductase (ALR) and protein adducts produced by reaction with lipid peroxidation products. A strong immunoreactivity to an anti-ALR antibody was observed in the epithelia of the epididymis, vas deferens, seminal vesicle, and prostate gland. Virtually the same cells were stained with a monoclonal antibody (mAb) 5F6, raised against an acrolein-modified protein. In the testis, however, mAb5F6 specifically stained the nuclei of somatic cells and less differentiated spermatogenic cells. While acrolein inactivated glutathione reductase, an enzyme involved in recycling oxidized glutathione, AKR activity was affected at the high concentration only. The colocalization of lipid peroxidation products and AKR in the epithelia of the male genital tract indicates that these tissues are exposed to oxidative stress and possess a protective system coordinately.","Acrolein; Aldo-keto reductase; Carbonyl compounds; Lipid peroxidation","acrolein; aldehyde reductase; carbonyl derivative; glutathione reductase; monoclonal antibody; oxidoreductase; reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; article; cell nucleus; cell protection; controlled study; detoxification; enzyme activation; enzyme activity; lipid peroxidation; male; male genital system; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidative stress; priority journal; protein expression; protein localization; rat; recycling; spermatocyte; staining; stress; testis; Acrolein; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Aldehydes; Animals; Blotting, Northern; Blotting, Western; Cell Culture Techniques; Cell Survival; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Lipid Peroxidation; Male; Metabolic Detoxication, Drug; Protein Binding; Proteins; Rats; Rats, Wistar; RNA, Messenger; Sertoli Cells; Testis; Animalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542283583

An improved understanding of this variability is needed to make accurate estimates of N2O fluxes at a regional scale. The objectives of this work were to (i) characterize the influence of soil-landscape combinations and N application rates on N2O emissions and to (ii) determine the contribution of these influences on the estimation of N2O emissions at the field scale. We used static chambers and gas chromatography methods to measure N2O fluxes and collected ancillary data (mineral N, water soluble C, soil water content, soil temperature) in Canada at Mundare (AB) in the aspen parkland ecoregion and at Swift Current (SK) in the short-grass prairie ecoregion. At Mundare, measurements were taken in 1995 and 1996 by landscape position and land use. At Swift Current, data were collected in 1999 and 2000 by landscape position and N rate. At Mundare, landscape position affected N2O emissions but the pattern varied seasonally. During a 46-d period in summer 1995, a flux of 430 g N2O-N ha-1 measured in a backslope was greater than the 60 g N2O-N ha -1 measured on average in shoulder and depressional areas. The flux pattern changed during a 43-d spring thaw of 1996 when fluxes from depressional areas were greatest (1710 g N2O-N ha-1). Nitrous oxide emissions from natural areas were small. The emission pattern during summer 1996 was similar to that of 1995 but the fluxes were an order of magnitude larger. At Swift Current, N2O fluxes in summer 1999 were affected by topography and N rate. Fluxes were greatest in depressional areas receiving N at 110 kg ha-1 (3140 g N2O-N ha-1). Use of the area fraction occupied by each landscape position to calculate N2O flux increased the estimates of N2O fluxes at the field scale in five out of six cases. Further research of N2O fluxes in variable landscapes should help elucidate factors controlling N2O fluxes from pedon to field scale and thus translate into improved flux estimates at regional scales.",,"Agriculture; Data reduction; Ecology; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Solubility; Ecoregions; Landscape; Gas emissions; agricultural soil; nitrous oxide; soil emission; Alberta; Canada; North America; Saskatchewan; Apus apus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142780811

The silicates belong to either the eclogitic or the peridotitic paragenesis. They are similar in composition to the larger mineral inclusions found in other Koffiefontein diamonds and record similar pressures and temperatures of formation (1000-1200°C, 4-6 GPa). The clouds also carry additional mineral phases that were not detected before in Koffiefontein: phlogopite, high-Si mica, an Al-Mg-rich phase and carbonates. In many cases silicate minerals coexist together with brine in individual microinclusions. Brines associated with either eclogitic or peridotitic minerals have similar composition and both are rich in water, Cl, K and carbonates (Izraeli et al., 2001). The above findings, together with the high proportion of cloudy diamonds in Koffiefontein, suggest that brine penetration into neighboring peridotitic and eclogitic rocks was pervasive. The high carbon content of the brine (as dissolved carbonates) initiated diamond growth in both rock types, most, on preexisting diamonds that now form inclusion-free cores. The low aggregation state of nitrogen in the cloudy diamonds, relative to other diamonds from Koffiefontein indicates either a somewhat lower temperature of storage in the mantle (which may be the reason for the presence of brine rather than melt) or a young event of cloudy diamond formation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.",,"brine; carbonate; crystallization; diamond; inclusion; P-T conditions; silicate; Africa; South Africa; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442622351

With climate change increasingly likely, strategies to reduce carbon emissions and stabilize climate are needed, including greater energy efficiency, renewable energy sources, geoengineering, decarbonization, and geological and biological sequestration. Two of the most commonly proposed biological strategies are restoring organic carbon in agricultural soils and using plantations to sequester carbon in soils and wood. Here, we compare scenarios of land-based sequestration to emissions reductions arising from increased fuel efficiency in transportation, targeting ways to reduce net U.S. emissions by 10% (≈0.16 Pg of carbon per year). Based on mean sequestration rates, converting all U.S. croplands to no-till agriculture or retiring them completely could sequester ≈0.059 Pg of carbon per year for several decades. Summary data across a range of plantations reveal an average rate of carbon storage an order of magnitude larger than in agricultural soils; in consequence, one-third of U.S. croplands or 44 million hectares would be needed for plantations to reach the target of ≈0.16 Pg of carbon per year. For fossil fuel reductions, cars and light trucks generated ≈0.31 Pg of carbon in U.S. emissions in 2001. To reduce net emissions by 0.16 Pg of carbon per year, a doubling of fuel efficiency for cars and light trucks is needed, a change feasible with current technology. Issues of permanence, leakage, and economic potentials are discussed briefly, as is the recognition that such scenarios are only a first step in addressing total U.S. emissions.","Agriculture and plantations; Carbon sequestration; Fossil fuel emissions; Leakage and permanence; Soil organic carbon","carbon; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; carbon storage; climate; energy; energy resource; engineering; geology; priority journal; review; soil; United States; wood; Agriculture; Air Pollution; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Fossil Fuels; Greenhouse Effect; Motor Vehicles; Soil; Trees; United States; Wood",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8644247463

Data to date, though, suggest that the NO2:NO ratio from modern diesel may exceed that of gasoline, and it is difficult to reduce diesel NOx below gasoline NOx without increasing particle emissions. Here, it is calculated that, unless the diesel NO2:NO ratio and total NOx are reduced to those of gasoline, modern diesel, which should have lower hydrocarbon (HC) and carbon monoxide (CO) emissions than gasoline, may still enhance photochemical smog at the surface and aloft, on average, over the U.S. relative to gasoline. The reason is that vehicle-produced smog in the U.S. depends more on NOx and the NO2:NO ratio than on HCs or CO. It is also found that vehicle NOx controls may be more effective than NO2:NO ratio controls at reducing ozone.

We illustrate the usefulness of the model system through various scenarios. Based upon a reference case without any deliberate emission control, the model system is used to analyze the change in emissions resulting from three abatement policies: a more aggressive reduction in aircraft NOx emissions through advanced engine technology, the substitution of some short-distance air travel with high-speed rail in suitable corridors, and the replacement of the hub-and-spoke system with exclusively direct flight connections. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The focus is on the development of and necessity for introducing new policy instruments for the built environment. Over the years, energy policy has evolved gradually to create a more integrated approach to the energy efficiency of buildings and larger urban districts. However, further evolution might be inevitable due to a shift of the primary driver for 'energy' policy from energy conservation to carbon dioxide reduction. Maximum targets of carbon dioxide emissions are being developed for each sector by 2010 and each sector has the obligation to meet its defined carbon dioxide reduction goal. Severe carbon dioxide reduction goals for the built environment in the Netherlands can only be achieved by means of energy efficiency improvement and fuel substitution, replacing natural gas with lower-carbon fuels. The introduction of lower-carbon fuels raises policy questions on whether to maintain the old infrastructure at great cost or whether investment should be in a new energy infrastructure and how this transition can be managed.","Built environment; Carbon dioxide reduction; Energy performance; Energy policy; Energy savings; Low-carbon futures; Synthetic natural gas; The Netherlands","Carbon dioxide; Energy conservation; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Natural gas; Particulate emissions; Reduction; Built environment; Carbon dioxide reduction; Carbon fuels; Infrastructure; Urban districts; Buildings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542398147

The Bohr effect (influence of pH/CO2 on Hb O2 affinity) and the reciprocal Haldane effect (influence of HbO2 saturation on H +/CO2 binding) originate in the Hb oxydeoxy conformational change and allosteric interactions between O2 and H+/ CO2 binding sites. In steady state, H+ is passively distributed across the vertebrate red blood cell (RBC) membrane, and intracellular pH (pHi) changes are related to changes in extracellular pH, Hb-O2 saturation and RBC organic phosphate content. As the Hb molecule shifts between the oxy and deoxy conformation in arterial-venous gas transport, it delivers O2 and takes up CO 2 and H+ in tissue capillaries (elegantly aided by the Bohr effect). Concomitantly, the RBC may sense local O2 demand via the degree of Hb deoxygenation and release vasodilatory agents to match local blood flow with requirements. Three recent hypotheses suggest (1) release of NO from S-nitroso-Hb upon deoxygenation, (2) reduction of nitrite to vasoactive NO by deoxy haems, and (3) release of ATP. Inside RBCs, carbonic anhydrase (CA) provides fast hydration of metabolic CO2 and ensures that the Bohr shift occurs during capillary transit. The formed H+ is bound to Hb (Haldane effect) while HCO3- is shifted to plasma via the anion exchanger (AE1). The magnitude of the oxylabile H+ binding shows characteristic differences among vertebrates. Alternative strategies for CO2 transport include direct HCO3- binding to deoxyHb in crocodilians, and high intracellular free [HCO3 -] (due to high pHi) in lampreys. At the RBC membrane, CA, AE1 and other proteins may associate into what appears to be an integrated gas exchange metabolon. Oxygenation-linked binding of Hb to the membrane may regulate glycolysis in mammals and perhaps also oxygen-sensitive ion transport involved in RBC volume and pHi regulation. Blood O2 transport shows several adaptive changes during exposure to environmental hypoxia.

The observation was made at Big Bear Solar Observatory (BBSO) at the wavelength of Hα -1.3 Å, with a cadence of 40 ms. The flare was also observed by the Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI). Three kernels appear in Hα - 1.3 Å images, two of which are conjugate kernels. The light curves of the two conjugate kernels show a correlation with that of hard X-rays (HXRs) in the 25-50 keV band; however, the third one does not. We use HXR images and spectra and the time delay between the Hα blue-wing emissions and HXRs to distinguish between the thermal and nonthermal character of spikes in the light curve. Among the four spikes we studied, the second spike is thermal, while the other three are nonthermal. What characterizes the thermal spike is the long time delay (∼10 s), the lack of HXR ""footpoint"" emission, and the absence of a power-law component in HXR imaging spectra. In addition, the spectrum of this spike is only well fitted by a double-temperature model with a hot (∼25.5 MK) component and a superhot (∼47.1 MK) component with different emission measures. The nonthermal spikes are characterized by short time delays ≲4 s, the RHESSI time resolution used in this paper), HXR footpoint emission, and power-law spectra. The relative Hα blue-wing intensities during the periods of the three nonthermal spikes are evaluated in terms of beam parameters: power-law index and X-ray flux at 10 keV. Comparison with the observations shows that the first spike of the early impulsive phase did not produce the predicted Hα intensity.","Sun: activity; Sun: chromosphere; Sun: flares; Sun: X-rays, gamma rays",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542535384

The model performance is evaluated using surface and airborne meteorological and chemical measurements made as part of the 2000 Texas Air Quality Study. A simulation that employed the reported mobile, area, biogenic, and point source emissions produced ozone mixing ratios as high as 120 ppb and distributions of nitrogen oxides that were similar to measurements at most locations, but the model underestimated ozone mixing ratios greater than 140 ppb that were located just downwind of petrochemical facilities. When the point source emission rates of ethene and propene were increased by a factor of 10, the simulated peak ozone levels were in better agreement with surface, aircraft, and lidar observations. The magnitude of the simulated ethene and olefin concentrations were in better agreement with canister samples aloft as well; however, there was still a large amount of scatter in the results. While the highest ozone mixing ratios were produced just downwind of large point source emissions of VOCs, sensitivity simulations also showed that reductions in anthropogenic emissions of NO x would be needed to reduce ozone mixing ratios over a larger area. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

This uncertainty affects the design of control strategies to reduce tropospheric 0 3 production. The effect of controlling ozone precursors on sensitivity regimes was evaluated by performing simulations with MM5-EMICAT2000-CMAQ model to represent 03 formation in the northeastern Iberian Peninsula with baseline emission rates for VOC and NOx, and reducing anthropogenic VOC and NO x emissions on a 35%. Three different scenarios were considered in order to assess chemical sensitivity in urban, industrial, and background domains. Areas downwind of the city of Barcelona benefit from NOx reductions (reduction of 10 ppb in ground-level O 3), while the same reduction causes an important increment of 03 in Barcelona (9 ppb) and the area downwind of Tarragona (18 ppb), with a high industrial influence. The city of Barcelona benefits from VOC reductions (10 ppb of 03) as well as the industrial zone of Alcover (20 ppb). The rest of the domain is practically insensitive to VOC reductions. Diverse photochemical species derived from the air quality model were used as indicators in order to establish the chemical sensitivity regime existing in the areas, analyzing whether O3 values reacted consistently to similar changes in emissions. Results showed that NOy (total reactive nitrogen) and O3/NOy are the indicators involving a lower uncertainty when assessing sensitivity, according to the narrow transition regime between NOx- and VOC-sensitive chemistry and the low uncertainty observed. Indicators performed better in VOC-sensitive than in NOx-sensitive domains. H2O 2- and HNO3- derived indicators entailed higher uncertainties since transition regimes between NOx and VOC sensitivity covered a wide range. The extent of reaction also performed as a good indicator to separate NOx- and VOC-sensitive regimes. This sensitivity analysis provides a tool for establishing hypothetical control policies for O3 precursor emissions through a comparison of simulated correlation between the species.

The La Porte data were compared to a roadway vehicle exhaust signature obtained from canister samples collected in the Houston Washburn tunnel during the same summer to better understand the impact of petrochemical emissions of hydrocarbons at the site. It is shown that the abundance of ethene, propene, 1-butene, C2-C4 alkanes, hexane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane, isopropylbenzene, and styrene at La Porte were systematically affected by petrochemical industry emissions. Coherent power law relationships between frequency distribution widths of hydrocarbon mixing ratios and their local lifetimes clearly identify two major source groups, roadway vehicle emissions and industrial emissions. Distributions of most aromatics and long chain alkanes were consistent with roadway vehicle emissions as the dominant source. Air mass reactivity was generally dominated by C1-C3 aldehydes. Propene and ethene sometimes dominated air mass reactivity with HO loss frequencies often greater than 10 s-1. Ozone mixing ratios near 200 ppbv were observed on two separate occasions, and these air masses appear to have been affected by industrial emissions of alkenes from the Houston Ship Channel. The La Porte data provide evidence of the importance of industrial emissions of ethene and propene on air mass reactivity and ozone formation in Houston.

Timberline migration to higher altitude is dependent on new seedling establishment in the tree-line ecotone; however, reductions in photosynthetic carbon gain in establishing seedlings have previously been interpreted solely in terms of decreased seedling survival. Our objective was to evaluate the impact of abiotic factors (temperature, light and water) on photosynthetic carbon gain in young seedlings of the two dominant conifer tree species occurring naturally above (tree-line ecotone site, TS) and below (forest site, FS) a Rocky Mountain timberline in southeastern Wyoming, USA. Coincidentally, measurements were made during an unusually dry summer. Mean daily photosynthesis in seedlings of both Abies lasiocarpa (Hook.) Nutt. (subalpine fir) and Picea engelmannii Parry ex Engelm. (Engelmann spruce) was less at TS than at FS (19 and 29%, respectively). Minimum nighttime temperatures below 2°C were more frequent at TS than at FS and were associated with reduced maximum photosynthesis the following day. Low midday water potentials were associated with a reduction in carbon gain at both sites early in the season, prior to snowmelt, as well as late in the season when soils began to dry. However, the lower photosynthetic rates at TS than at FS appeared to be unrelated to seedling water status because seedlings at both sites had similar xylem pressure potentials. Solar irradiance was highly variable at both sites as a result of uneven shading by neighboring trees, although this variation was substantially reduced on cloudy days (44% of all days observed). Compared with sunny days, cloudy days resulted in greater integrated daily carbon gain at both sites (41% increase at TS and 69% increase at FS), based on a simulated photosynthesis model. Photosynthetic responses to temperature, sunlight and water suggest that variable solar irradiance and nighttime temperatures were major abiotic factors limiting photosynthetic carbon acquisition in these young seedlings, especially for seedlings growing in the tree-line ecotone.","Carbon gain; Cloud effects; Engelmann spruce; Microclimate; Subalpine fir; Tree line; Water","carbon sequestration; coniferous tree; environmental factor; photosynthesis; treeline; North America; Rocky Mountains; United States; Wyoming; Abies; Abies lasiocarpa; Abies lasiocarpa; Coniferales; Coniferophyta; Picea; Picea engelmannii; Picea engelmannii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942455866

Infant markets already exist and, in 2002, they traded perhaps $10 million worth of emissions allowances. We estimate conservatively that, by 2010, the EU scheme will trade as much as $1 billion in allowances each year. The motor of the carbon markets is a worldwide effort to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases. Its most visible symbol is the Kyoto Protocol of 1997, formally known as the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Even if Kyoto is not ratified and, despite the US's decision to opt out of the treaty, the genie of greenhouse-gas reduction is out of the bottle. We believe that trading of greenhouse gases will be a real, day-to-day activity by 2010, almost certainly in Europe and probably in Canada and Japan. Carbon trading in these areas will affect the US, whether or not America sets up a programme of its own. The conclusion of this study is that industry should get involved in defining carbon trading-and now-to advance and defend their interests. Interest should be greatest among producers and users of the greenhouse gases other than carbon dioxide, namely methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The timing of leaf flush was assumed to be the first day during which a rainfall event exceeded that day's estimate of potential evapotranspiration after a defined dry season. Leaf senescence was assumed to be a dynamic feedback between soil water potential and net plant carbon gain and was determined by dynamically modeling the effects of concomitant trends in soil water potential and net primary production on leaf area index (LAI). Model predictions of LAI were compared with satellite-derived normalized difference vegetation indices (NDVI) for 3 years at two sites along the Kalahari transect. The mean absolute error for the prediction of modeled leaf flush date compared with leaf flush dates estimated from NDVI were 10.0 days for the Maun site and 39.3 days for the Tshane site. Correlations between model predicted 10-day average LAI and 10-day composite NDVI for both Maun and Tshane were high (ρ = 0.67 and 0.74, respectively, P <0.001), suggesting that this method adequately predicts intra-annual leaf area dynamics in these dry tropical ecosystems. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","BIOME-BGC; Drought deciduous; Model; Phenology; Tropical","ecosystem modeling; phenology; precipitation (climatology); soil water; vegetation; Africa; Kalahari Desert; Southern Africa; Sub-Saharan Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842784626

Seventy-three cases of carbon monoxide poisoning were assessed at 3 days and 1 month post poisoning on tasks of attentional orienting, and tasks of the supervisory attention system. The results were compared to a group of 53 healthy community participants. A deficit of the supervisory attentional system was documented on a task of attention switching in survivors of both deliberate and accidental CO poisoning, leaving attentional scheduling intact. There was no deficit of attentional orienting in the current study. Alteration of consciousness was found to predict subsequent supervisory attention system impairment in correlation analyses, and the deficit was persistent for a 1 month follow-up period.

Fish preexposed to β-naphthoflavone (βNF) or caged in a polluted river were exposed to waterborne 3H-benzo[a]pyrene (3H-BaP). The 3H-benzo[a]pyrene adducts in the gill filaments were localized by autoradiography and CYP1A protein by immunohistochemistry. Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) activity was measured using a gill filament-based ex vivo assay. Branchial 3H-BaP binding and EROD activity were enhanced by exposure to βNF or to the river water, and completely blocked by the CYP1A inhibitor ellipticine. The predominant sites of adduct formation were in epithelium of the secondary lamellae and in epithelium of the efferent edge of the gill filament. In βNF-exposed fish, the strongest CYP1A immunoreactivity was observed in differentiating cells and in pillar cells. In fish caged in the polluted river, strong CYP1A immunoreactivity was found in most cells in the secondary lamellae, whereas the primary lamellae were almost devoid of immunoreactivity. Our results reveal a discrepancy between the localization of CYP1A protein and BaP adducts in the gill. Consequently, other factors, such as bioavailability of waterborne polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) to the target cells, are important for the localization of PAH adducts in the gill.","Adduct; Benzo[a]pyrene; Cytochrome P4501A; Gill","Aquaculture; Bioassay; Biodiversity; Cells; Environmental engineering; Immunology; Pollution; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Proteins; Radiography; Bioavailability; Rivers; benzo[a]pyrene; beta naphthoflavone; cytochrome P450 1A; cytochrome P450 inhibitor; ellipticine; ethoxyresorufin deethylase; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; river water; tritium; bioavailability; ecotoxicology; fish; pyrene; river pollution; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; autoradiography; binding assay; bioavailability; cell specificity; cell type; cellular distribution; complex formation; controlled study; enzyme activity; enzyme assay; enzyme induction; ex vivo study; field experiment; gill; immunohistochemistry; immunoreactivity; laboratory test; nonhuman; priority journal; protein expression; rainbow trout; target cell; tissue distribution; water pollution; Animals; Benzo(a)pyrene; Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A1; DNA Adducts; Environmental Exposure; Gills; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Animalia; Oncorhynchus; Oncorhynchus mykiss; Salmonidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842511564

Radio emission from these planets results from solar wind-powered electron currents depositing energy in the magnetic polar regions. We find that most of the known extrasolar planets should emit in the frequency range 10-1000 MHz and, under favorable circumstances, have typical flux densities as large as 1 mJy. We also describe an initial, systematic effort to search for radio emission in low radio frequency images acquired with the Very Large Array (VLA). The limits set by the VLA images (≈300 mJy) are consistent with, but do not provide strong constraints on, the predictions of the model. Future radio telescopes, such as the Low Frequency Array and the Square Kilometer Array, should be able to detect the known extrasolar planets or place austere limits on their radio emission. Planets with masses much lower than those in the current census will probably radiate below 10 MHz and will require a space-based array.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744269978

Six samples were collected during the two central hours of each night flood tide. The community was dominated by Engraulidae, various species of Gobiidae, mainly Mkrogobius meeki, and Gerreidae as a distant third. Non-resident species showed low abundance. Seasonality was well marked, with highest abundance, lowest diversity and equitability between February and April, though individual taxa displayed large differences amongst themselves. Variations in the structure and abundance of the community did not present any obvious correlation with freshwater input, salinity or water temperature, features that appear similar to those detected in the single other South-Amencan tropical estuary similarly studied. At the continental scale, the communities of these two estuaries differ from those of Amazonian river-dominated estuaries and of wind-driven sub-tropical or temperate lagoonal systems. In both, the community is numerically dominated by estuarine-dependent taxa, amongst which numerous Sciaenidae, and seasonal variations appear regulated by climatic conditions: either rainfall or temperature.",,"abundance; community structure; estuary; ichthyoplankton; seasonality; species diversity; Brazil; South America; Western Hemisphere; World; Engraulidae; Gerreidae; Gobiidae; Sciaenidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9144222203

In the city, they can be implemented in roof tops, abandoned industrial areas, vertical surfaces of buildings, backyards, porches and public parks. In the suburbs, greywater can be treated in private gardens and reused for irrigation. The performance and control restraints often found disappointing in nature-based systems have been overcome in the past two decades: current systems achieve effluent qualities similar to conventional sewage treatment plants. With area requirements expected to come down to 2.0 m2 per p.e. they would need only two or three times more space. To the core task of treating wastewater they add valuable ecosystem services like micro-climate regulation, rainwater retention, production of renewable energy and/or food, air filtering, noise reduction and recreational values as biotopes with flora and fauna. They represent a new philosophy of dealing with wastes: recycling of nutrients from a valuable resource instead of mere disposal. The new concepts of closing loops call for a more integrated approach represented by the ecological engineer. With its expertise in landscape design and plant usage, horticulture is a key science to promote ecological engineering.","Climate regulation; Closed loop; Constructed wetlands; Urban development; Water and nutrient cycle",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84879632642

Closed chamber measurements were made during the ice-free period in central Finland. Methane fluxes were quantified at an interval of a few hours for several boreal lakeshore communities consisting of Phragmites australis (Cav.) Trin. ex Steud. and of wetland sedges, grasses, and herbs. The automated measurement system was operated for 4 months in a P. australis stand and for 2 months in a site with mixed wetland vegetation. Additional manual measurements lasted for a few days. In P. australis stands the CH4 fluxes were typically highest around noon. On the average, effiux of CH4 measured during office hours (0800-1600 local time (LT)) should be corrected using a factor 0.68 to obtain a more reliable estimate of daily CH4 release. The fluctuation magnitude varied between different locations and over the study period, being the greatest in the most productive parts of the stands in August. A harmonic regression model, scaled with temperature and stand biomass, was successfully applied to reconstruct CH 4 flux in P. australis stand. In the sedge, grass and herb stands the diurnal fluctuation in CH4 flux was generally small. Commonly, daily maximum in efflux occurred during evening or night and large (threefold) diurnal differences were occasionally found. Daytime measurements alone can result in a slight or moderate underestimate of the total flux for the wetland communities. These results recommend that spatial and seasonal differences in diurnal CH 4 flux dynamics should be considered when planning measuring or modeling CH4 fluxes.

This study was aimed to estimate the emissions from various types of garden biomasses, namely grass, leaves, twigs and mixtures of these three in a controlled SIFT chamber. Though the particulate emission (1.51 g kg -1) was the lowest from grass, the particle size distribution indicates that the emission contains 10% of fine particulates (&lt;2.5 μm) and significant quantity (70%) of respirable fraction (&lt;10 μm). On the other hand, leaves, though generating 32.3 g kg -1 particulate matter, contained major portion in non-respirable range (around 40%). CO 2 emission from leaves (1064.6 g kg -1) and twigs (897.3 g kg -1) are significantly lower than the emission from a mixture (1423 g kg -1) of equal proportion of these two. Similar trend is followed in case of carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide emissions. However, hydrocarbon emission followed a reverse trend of emitting high emission load (11.4 g kg -1) in the mixture of leaves and twigs than their individual type (2.4 g kg -1 (leaves) and 0.2 g kg -1 (twigs)). The toxicity indices for all categories were very low (0.06-0.12). However, out of the five categories, grass was found to have the lowest toxicity index (0.06) and followed by the mixture (1:1:1), having 0.07. The particulate matter emission load computed for the cities of India shows that the leaves and grass contribute 97 and 4.5 tons day -1, respectively. Among the gaseous pollutants, CO 2 emission was the highest, as the computed values were 3212 tons day -1 from leaves and 92 tons day -1 from grass. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Few articles came from other Annex I countries, but these generally provided only the most basic aspects of a future regime. Meanwhile, concerns for equity and the relevance of any new regime in terms of sustainable development were clear in proposals from non-Annex I countries. Differences among regions were considered to be a reflection of current circumstances in each author's region. The capacity and culture of authors in some regions were considered to be other possible factors in differences. The paper concludes that recognition of regional background that formulate respective preferences and concerns regarding a future climate regime will be important to help reach a multilateral agreement in future official negotiations.","Climate change; Comparative study; International regime; Kyoto Protocol; UN framework convention on climate change","climate change; equity; international agreement; Kyoto Protocol",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13644282992

Waters and sediments of 92 lakes were sampled for mercury, methylmercury, and ancillary parameters. Yellow perch (Perca flavescens) muscle tissues were analyzed for mercury on 47 of these lakes. Interannual variation in mercury was limited; only epilimnetic Hg was elevated by approximately 1.5 ng/L in 1998 over remaining years because of wet weather. Aqueous total and methylmercury concentrations were elevated in both dystrophic and eutrophic lakes over other types. Yellow perch tissue concentrations were elevated by 0.218 μg/g in dystrophic lakes over other types and were very low in eutrophic lakes. Fish tissue mercury concentrations showed no relationship to hypolimnetic or sediment mercury or methylmercury. A statistical model indicated that yellow perch tissues in 40.2 ± 13% of lakes were likely to exceed the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) methylmercury criterion of 0.3 μg/g, and yellow perch from New Hampshire were twice as likely to exceed the criterion as those from Vermont.

In this research, we have studied two ways of combining the electrical conductance and electron emission properties in carbon materials. In one case, the two characters are mingled atomistically to form a rather uniform mixture of amorphous diamond. Alternatively, graphite basal planes are wrapped around to form nano-tubes that exhibit a slight diamond character. Both amorphous diamond and carbon nano-tubes (CNTs) contain emission tips of nanometer sizes. When they are connected to a negative bias, they can emit electrons in vacuum toward an anode at very low turn-on field. However, when the cathode material is heated up, the responses of electron emission in vacuum are dramatically different between the two types of carbon materials. At a temperature of 300 °C, amorphous diamond can emit 13 times more electrons than it did at room temperature; but CNTs show no response to thermal agitation. The thermally sensitive emission of amorphous diamond indicated that electrons climbed up an energy ladder to reach the vacuum level for efficient emission. The energy ladder contained minute but discrete energy levels that were created by distorting the tetrahedral bonds of carbon atoms to different degrees. On the other hand, the CNTs are substantially graphitic so the energy gap between their conduction band and valence band overlap and are continuous in energy. In this case, electrons could not acquire energy to reach the vacuum energy unless the temperature could be sufficiently high. Hence, it confirms that CNTs emit electrons primarily by enhancing the applied field on nano-tips. This is in contrast to amorphous diamond that emits electrons by combining graphitic carbon atoms and diamond-like carbon atoms of various states. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

This paper also examines reference conditions for determining absorbed dose to water in the cases of therapeutic carbon and proton beams. In the dose calibration procedure recommended by IAEA, irradiation fields should be larger than 10 cm in diameter and the water phantom should extend by at least 5 cm beyond each side of the field. These recommendations are experimentally verified for proton and carbon beams. For proton beams, the calibration coefficients obtained by these three methods approximately agreed. For carbon beams, the calibration coefficients obtained by the second method were about 1.0% larger than those obtained by the third method, and the calibration coefficients obtained by cross-calibration using 290 MeV/u beams were 0.5% lower than those obtained using 400 MeV/u beams.

It was the worst air pollution event ever seen in this area. In order to develop the scientific PM2.5 control strategies for hazy episodes in this area, it is necessary to investigate the chemical characteristics of air pollutants during hazy episodes and evaluate where these high concentrations came from. All measurements were simultaneously taken using two sets of annular denuder system (ADS) to collect acidic gas pollutants and PM2.5 species. To characterize chemical species for the hazy days, the data were divided into the hazy and non-hazy episodes. Atmospheric HNO 3, HNO2, and SO2 during the hazy episodes increased by a factor of about 1.6-2.1 compared to those during the non-hazy episodes. The NO3-, SO42-, and NH4+ during the hazy episodes increased by a factor of about 4.4-6.1 compared to those during the non-hazy episodes. In addition, ambient PM2.5 concentrations for hazy days were a factor of 1.3-3.3 in excess of the 65μgm-3, which is the 24-h US PM2.5 NAAQS. The mean concentrations of carbonaceous species during the hazy and non-hazy episodes were 29.26 and 11.76μgm-3 for organic carbon (OC) and were 9.75 and 7.23μgm-3 for elemental carbon (EC), respectively. Higher OC concentrations were observed in the hazy episodes, which may be influenced by biomass burning which occurred from the outside of the Seoul area rather than the local atmospheric formation of secondary OC. The results of the backward air trajectory analysis and weather charts reconfirmed the possibility of the effect of biomass burning.

This experiment is a part of the Climate Variability and Predictability Program (CLIVAR) Seasonal Model Intercomparison Project II (SMIP II). The observed SSTs are used for the external boundary condition of the model integration; thus, the present study assesses the upper limit of predictability of the seasonal prediction system. The analysis shows that the tropical precipitation is largely controlled by the given SST condition and is thus predictable, particularly in the ENSO region. But the extratropical precipitation is less predictable due to the large contribution of the internal atmospheric processes to the seasonal mean. The systematic error of the ensemble mean prediction is particularly large in the subtropical western Pacific, where the air-sea interaction is active and thus the two-tier approach of the present prediction experiment is not appropriate for correct predictions in the region. The statistical postprocessing method based on singular value decomposition corrects a large part of the systematic errors over the globe. In particular, about two-thirds of the total errors in the western Pacific are corrected by the postprocessing method. As a result, the potential predictability of the summer-mean precipitation is greatly enhanced over most of the globe by the statistical correction method; the 21-yr-averaged pattern-correlation value between the predictions and their observed counterparts is changed from 0.31 before the correction to 0.48 after the correction for the global domain and from 0.04 before the correction to 0.26 after the correction for the Asian monsoon and the western Pacific region. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Atmospheric thermodynamics; Error analysis; Meteorology; Precipitation (meteorology); Thermal effects; Air-sea interaction; Extratropical precipitation; Global domain; Sea surface temperature; Summer mean precipitation; Two-tier approach; Climatology; air-sea interaction; climate modeling; error correction; precipitation (climatology); sea surface temperature; seasonal variation; seasonality; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (West)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842481194

This was performed by labeling biomolecules with fluorophores that serve as donor-acceptor pairs for Förster resonance energy transfer, and by using alternating-laser excitation to excite directly both donors and acceptors present in single diffusing molecules. Emissions were reduced to the distance-dependent ratio E, and a distance-independent, stoichiometry-based ratio S. Histograms of E and S sorted species based on the conformation and association status of each species. S was sensitive to the stoichiometry and relative brightness of fluorophores in single molecules, observables that can monitor oligomerization and local-environment changes, respectively. FAMS permits equilibrium and kinetic analysis of macromolecule-ligand interactions; this was validated by measuring equilibrium and kinetic dissociation constants for the interaction of Escherichia coli catabolite activator protein with DNA. FAMS is a general platform for ratiometric measurements that report on structure, dynamics, stoichiometries, environment, and interactions of diffusing or immobilized molecules, thus enabling detailed mechanistic studies and ultrasensitive diagnostics.","Biomolecular interactions; Catabolite activator protein; Förster resonance energy transfer; Protein-DNA interactions; Single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy","cyclic AMP binding protein; DNA; article; Escherichia coli; fluorescence resonance energy transfer; fluorescence spectroscopy; ligand binding; macromolecule; molecular dynamics; nonhuman; priority journal; protein DNA interaction; protein protein interaction; protein targeting; single molecule fluorescence spectroscopy; stoichiometry; Cyclic AMP Receptor Protein; Diffusion; DNA; Escherichia coli Proteins; Fluorescence Resonance Energy Transfer; Fluorescent Dyes; Kinetics; Lasers; Normal Distribution; Protein Binding; Escherichia coli",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942650138

With focus upon emission factors from existing production technology, vehicles produced between 1989 and 1998 with considerable mileage (7000 to 280,000) are chosen. Among the five vehicles, four were sold in the European market, whereas one was sold in the US market. The vehicles are tested on a chassis dynamometer. An EU2000 Driving Cycle (NEDC) and a US Urban Driving Cycle (UDC) of the Federal Test Procedure 75 (FTP-75) are used in the study. The regulated emissions are measured using a Horiba Mexa series. Unregulated emissions, ammonia (NH3), nitrous oxide (N2O) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) are analysed by mass spectrometer, gas chromatography and CNT-NA, TIM315-74W method, respectively. Both the unregulated emissions and the regulated emissions show driving cycle dependency; and they are also improved with newer vehicle and emission control technology. However, a gasoline direct injection vehicle (relatively new technology in this study) has rather high regulated emissions, whereas the NH3, N2O and HCN emissions are low. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A meeting sponsored by Global Observation of Forest Cover/Global Observation of Land Dynamics and International Geosphere-Biosphere Program/International Global Atmospheric Chemistry/Biomass Burning Experiment to review the status of efforts using satellite-based burned-area products to estimate global emissions from biomass burning was held in July 2002. Here we summarize the results of papers submitted from this meeting and contained in this special section. In addition, the findings and recommendations from the workshop are summarized. While new burned-area products make it possible to estimate wildland fire emissions at continental and global scales, differences in approaches to quantify fuel loads and combustion factors lead to significant variations in emissions estimates. These differences highlight the need for in-depth comparisons between emission estimation approaches and further research directed toward integration of research conducted at regional scales into the global-scale approaches to estimate emissions.

The study sites cover gradients in climate and N deposition from the southern boreal Øygard Brook (2.6 km2) in SW Norway, via the southern /middle boreal Simojoki River (3610 km2) in northern Finland to the sub-arctic Dalelva Brook (3.2 km2) in northern Norway. The INCA scenario simulations included future N deposition scenarios (current legislation and maximum feasible reduction) and climate scenarios for 2050 (ECHAM4/OPYC3; HadCM3) treated separately and in combination. As a result of climate change, the INCA model predicted markedly reduced duration and amounts of snow cover in all catchments. The occurrence of winter rainfall and melting periods was predicted to become more frequent so that more frequent floods in winter will, to a large extent, replace the regular snowmelt flood in spring. At the northernmost catchment. Dalelva, the predicted temperature increase might result in a doubling of the net mineralisation rate, thereby greatly increasing the amount of available inorganic N. At all catchments, the increased N supply was predicted to be largely balanced by a corresponding increase in N retention, and relatively small increases in NO3- leaching rates were predicted. This dynamic relationship is, however, strongly dependent on the temperature responses of the key N transformation processes modelled. A future reduction in N emissions and deposition, as agreed under current legislation, would have pronounced effects on concentrations of NO 3- in streamwater at the southernmost catchment, Øygard, even following a climate change around 2050. At the more remote Dalelva and Simojoki catchments, the N emission reductions will be small compared to the internal N recycling processes, and climate change will to a large extent offset the effects of reduced N deposition. © EGU.","Catchments; Climate; Hydrology; Nitrate leaching; Nitrogen deposition; Scenarios; Surface water","atmospheric deposition; catchment; leaching; nitrogen cycle; surface water; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; Finland; Northern Europe; Norway; Scandinavia; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13444281907

The SAM-modification effects on the molecular aggregation of 5CB were investigated by steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence analysis for the PDLC films. Remarkably, it was found that selective excitation of the interface layer with the substrate surface gave both the monomer and excimer emissions of 5CB in relative intensities, depending on the chemical nature of the SAM surfaces. While the monomer and excimer emissions appeared in comparative intensities in the case of the unmodified quartz surface, the surface modification with the SAM of 1 resulted in a dominant contribution of the excimer emission. By contrast, the monomer emission was much stronger than the excimer emission in the case of the surface modified by the SAM of 2. The surface modification with the SAM of 3 gave a fluorescence spectrum very similar to that in the case of the unmodified surface. Fluorescence decay analysis for the PDLC films revealed that the excimer emission consists of two components with shorter (1.3-1.6 ns) and longer (10-12 ns) lifetimes, whose relative contributions depend on the SAM modifications. The molecular pictures of 5CB depicted from the decay dynamics are in good agreement with those derived from the steady-state fluorescence behavior of the PDLC films. Electrooptic devices based on the PDLC films were constructed by using indium-tin oxide transparent electrodes modified with the SAMs, and it was confirmed that the electrooptic responses again significantly depend on the modifications of the substrate surface. The dependency of the fluorescence and electrooptic behavior on the surface modifications of the PDLC films has been discussed in terms of anchoring effects of the substrate surfaces, which effectively work even in heterogeneous materials such as PDLCs.",,"Dispersions; Electrooptical effects; Emission spectroscopy; Films; Fluorescence; Liquid crystal polymers; Molecular spectroscopy; Surface chemistry; Polymer dispersed liquid crystal films; Self assembled monolayers; Time resolved fluorescence analysis; Monolayers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642419808

FTIR images of polymer blends under high-pressure CO2 were obtained in situ using a single reflection ATR diamond accessory combined with a high-pressure cell. Two systems, a polystyrene (PS)/poly(vinyl methyl ether) (PVME) blend and a poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) system, have been studied to demonstrate the feasibility and principles of this new approach. Using this approach, the CO2-induced phase separation of an initially homogeneous PS/PVME blend was observed at a CO2 pressure of 60 bar and temperature of 40°C. FTIR imaging allowed us to identify formation of distinct domains that are PS- and PVME-rich. The size of these domains was ca. 200 μm. In a second high-pressure imaging experiment, the interfacial region between PEO and PMMA was studied. Sorption of high-pressure CO2 in both polymers was studied simultaneously. The effect of temperature and pressure on the solubility of CO2 in PMMA and PEO was demonstrated. The sorption of CO2 in PEO reduced the melting point of the polymer which facilitated an increase in CO2 sorption. The successful demonstration of this novel spectroscopic imaging approach under high pressure opens up new possibilities for studying polymeric materials subjected to high-pressure gases and supercritical fluids.",,"Carbon dioxide; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; High pressure effects; Imaging techniques; Phase separation; Polyethylene oxides; Polymethyl methacrylates; Polystyrenes; Solubility; Sorption; Thermal effects; Vinyl resins; High pressure carbon dioxide; Polyvinyl methyl ether; Polymer blends",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0442326632

We find that very large amounts of wind power can produce nonnegligible climatic change at continental scales. Although large-scale effects are observed, wind power has a negligible effect on global-mean surface temperature, and it would deliver enormous global benefits by reducing emissions of CO2 and air pollutants.

In this article, we study genes whose expression is regulated by a ligand-activated transcription factor, aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), that mediates responses to a variety of toxins. AhR-mediated change in expression of AhR target genes was measured by oligonucleotide microarrays and by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction in human and rat hepatocytes. Promoters and long-distance regulatory regions (>10 kb) of AhR-responsive genes were analyzed by the genetic algorithm and a variety of other computational methods. Rules were established on the local oligonucleotide context in the flanks of the AhR binding sites, on the occurrence of clusters of AhR recognition elements, and on the presence in the promoters of specific combinations of multiple binding sites for the transcription factors cooperating in the AhR regulatory network.

Using the driver input, the state of charge (SOC) of the energy storage, the motor/generator speed, the current gear ratio and vehicle speed, a set of 44 rules have been developed, in a fuzzy controller, to effectively determine the power split between the electric machine and the internal combustion engine (ICE). The underlying theme of the fuzzy controller is to optimize the fuel flow and reduce NOx emission. The parameters in the fuzzy rules can be adjusted to trade-off the fuel economy and the NO x emission of the vehicle. Simulation results are used to assess the performance of the controller. A forward-looking hybrid vehicle simulation model is used to implement the control strategies.

Analyses of slurries of NIST SRM 1648, Urban Particulate Matter, were typically within 10% of expected values for all elements except Al, Cr, and Fe, elements for which deviations were mostly due to difficulties in transferring large particles. This problem will be reduced for urban fine particulate matter samples (PM2.5). Trends in the concentrations of elemental source markers were readily correlated with wind direction and other meteorological factors to identify the influences of local industrial emissions, including motor vehicle traffic, coal- and oil-fired power plants, and municipal incinerators. Factor analysis was applied to the 88-sample data set to extract 7 factors: urban dust, meteorological factors, incinerators, coal-fired power plants, Tour Bus emission, unknown As source, and oil-fired power plants. Factor analysis was also applied to an 18-sample data set representing 2.5 h averages of the 30 min data to simulate the effect of longer sample collection times. Only 6 factors were extracted from this data set, which shows that increased temporal resolution enhances the power of factor analysis to resolve sources.

This has led to a demand for power supply systems and equipment that can boost distribution per line capacity from 6 kV to 22 kV, that can deliver loads close to where the power is consumed, and minimize power losses in distribution which reduces CO 2 emissions and thus helps mitigate global warming. Standing in the way of greater deployment of 22-kV switchgear is that the equipment is larger and more costly than prevailing 6-kV equipment.

Although incentive programs for scrapping old, high-emitting vehicles have been implemented to reduce urban air pollutants and greenhouse gases, these policies may create additional sales of new vehicles as well. From a life cycle perspective, the emissions from both the additional vehicle production and scrapping need to be addressed when evaluating the benefits of scrapping older vehicles. This study explores an optimal fleet conversion policy based on mid-sized internal combustion engine vehicles in the US, defined as one that minimizes total life cycle emissions from the entire fleet of new and used vehicles. To describe vehicles' lifetime emission profiles as functions of accumulated mileage, a series of life cycle inventories characterizing environmental performance for vehicle production, use, and retirement was developed for each model year between 1981 and 2020. A simulation program is developed to investigate ideal and practical fleet conversion policies separately for three regulated pollutants (CO, NMHC, and NOx) and for CO2. According to the simulation results, accelerated scrapping policies are generally recommended to reduce regulated emissions, but they may increase greenhouse gases. Multi-objective analysis based on economic valuation methods was used to investigate trade-offs among emissions of different pollutants for optimal fleet conversion policies. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The process of implementing the mechanism is, however, fraught with challenges. The absence of the United States in the carbon market has induced the low price of certified emissions reductions through the CDM, while host countries desire to ensure the sustainable development benefits of the CDM is likely to result in a complex approval process, which would further increase transaction costs. This article examines the CDM implementation environment in the context of a South African case study.

Also we evaluated the optimum treatment condition of the three phase fluidized bed process for emitting nitrous oxide. The results of this study showed that the three phase fluidized bed process was more effective than the activated sludge process for controlling nitrous oxide emission and removing nitrogen. Increasing amount of A. faecalis in reactor should be encouraged for controlling nitrous oxide emission and removing nitrogen. In addition, the activated sludge process using immobilized A. faecalis as a carrier had more nitrogen removal efficiency than conventional activated sludge process. The accumulation of NO2-N, NO3-N resulted in high N2O emission. Therefore, we suggested that it is necessary to reduce NO2-N and NO3-N for both reducing N2O emission and improving nitrogen removal.","Activated carbon; Alcaligenes faecalis; Nitrous oxide; Three phase fluidized bed process","Fluidized bed process; Gas emissions; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Sludge disposal; Heterotrophic nitrifiers; Nitrous oxide emissions; Environmental engineering; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; activated sludge; Alcaligenes faecalis; biodegradation; comparative study; conference paper; fluidized bed; greenhouse effect; immobilized biomass; nitrification; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; waste water management; Alcaligenes; Bioreactors; Environmental Monitoring; Greenhouse Effect; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Alcaligenes; Alcaligenes faecalis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042813969

The negatively-acting sequence was located in the -607 ∼ -447 bp upstream region of the GCS gene. The upstream sequence responsible for induction by menadione (MD) and L-buthionine-(S, R)-sulfoximine (BSO) resides in the -607 ∼ -447bp region, whereas the sequence which codes for nitric oxide induction is located within the -447 bp region, measured from the translational initiation point. Carbon source-dependent regulation of the GCS gene appeared to be dependent on the nucleotide sequence within -447 bp region. The transcription factor Pap1 is involved in the induction of the GCS gene by MD and BSO, but not by nitric oxide. Induction of the GCS gene occurring due to low glucose concentration does not depend on the presence of Papl. These data imply that induction by MD and BSO may be mediated by the Pap1 binding site, probably located in the -607 ∼ -447 region, and also that the nitric oxide-mediated regulation of the S. pombe GCS gene may share a similar mechanism with its carbon-dependent induction.","γ-glutamylcysteine synthetase; Glutathione; Pap1; Schizosaccharomyces pombe; Transcriptional regulation","glutamate cysteine ligase; article; binding site; controlled study; gene control; gene sequence; genetic transcription; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; RNA translation; Schizosaccharomyces pombe; Basic-Leucine Zipper Transcription Factors; DNA-Binding Proteins; Fungal Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Glutamate-Cysteine Ligase; Schizosaccharomyces; Schizosaccharomyces pombe Proteins; Transcription, Genetic; Schizosaccharomyces; Schizosaccharomyces pombe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6344231392

The surface cooling induced by the reduced CO2 concentration is larger than that by the ice sheet topography plus other factors by about 30% for the surface air temperature and by about 100% for the sea surface temperature. A large inter-hemispheric asymmetry in surface cooling with a larger cooling in the Northern Hemisphere is found for both cases. This asymmetric inter-hemispheric temperature response is consistent in the ice sheet topography case with earlier studies using an atmospheric model coupled with a mixed-layer ocean representation, but contrasts with these results in the reduced CO2 case. The incorporation of ocean dynamics presumably leads to a larger snow and sea ice feedback as a result of the reduction in northward ocean heat transport, mainly as a consequence of the decrease in the North Atlantic overturning circulation by the substantial freshening of the North Atlantic convection regions. A reversed case is found in the Southern Ocean. Overall, the reduction in atmospheric CO2 concentration accounts for about 60% of the total LGM climate change. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"albedo; atmosphere-ice-ocean system; atmospheric gas; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate modeling; ice sheet; Last Glacial Maximum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142538782

The ""gold standard"" for such credits is assumed to be a relatively riskless credit based on a CO2 emission reduction that provides offsets against CO2 emissions on a one-for-one basis. The number of credits associated with carbon sequestration needs to account for time, risk, durability, permanence, additionality, and other factors that future trade regulators will most certainly use to assign ""official"" credits to sequestration projects. The method that is presented here uses established principles of natural resource accounting and conventional rules of asset valuation to ""score"" projects. A review of 20 ""early"" voluntary United States based CO2 offset trades that involve carbon sequestration reveals that the assumptions that buyers, sellers, brokers, and traders are using to characterize the economic potential of their investments and trades vary enormously. The article develops a ""universal carbon sequestration credit scoring equation"" and uses two of these trades to illustrate the sensitivity of trade outcomes to various assumptions about how future trade auditors are likely to ""score"" carbon sequestration projects in terms of their ""equivalency"" with CO2 emission reductions. The article emphasizes the importance of using a standard credit scoring method that accounts for time and risk to assess and compare even unofficial prototype carbon sequestration trades. The scoring method illustrated in this article is a tool that can protect the integrity of carbon sequestration credit trading and can assist buyers and sellers in evaluating the real economic potential of prospective trades.","Additionality; Baselines; Credits; Investments; Leakage; Risk; Trades","Carbon; Environmental engineering; Investments; Carbon sequestration; Emission reduction; Resource accounting; Cost accounting; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; economic instrument; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; carbon sequestration; conference paper; economic aspect; environmental protection; risk assessment; scoring system; soil analysis; standardization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042699713

These parameters were modelled on a regional basis, according to local soils and crop rotations in England, and avoided the use of soil related indices. The largest carbon sequestration and saving contribution possible comes from an increase in the proportion of permanent woodland, such that a 10% change in land use could amount to 9 Mt C yr-1 in the initial years (arable and grassland). Changes in arable management could make a significant contribution to an abatement strategy if carried out in concert with greater use of permanent conservation field margins, increased returns of crop residues and reduced tillage systems, contributing 1.3 Mt C yr-1 in the initial years. It should be noted, however, that true soil carbon sequestration would be only a minor component of this (125 kt C yr-1), the main part being savings on CO2 emissions from reduced energy use, and lower N2O emissions from reduced use of inorganic nitrogen fertilizer.","Carbon sequestration; Energy use; Farm systems; Greenhouse gases; Land management; SOC","agricultural soil; carbon sequestration; energy use; greenhouse gas; soil management; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13544263433

Beginning in 1997 nine experimental plots were established: three open-top chambers with ambient CO2 levels (approximately 365 μmol mol-1), three open-top chambers with twice-ambient CO2 levels (approximately 720 μmol mol-1), and three unchambered control plots. After 3 years of growing-season CO2 treatment, the aboveground N concentration of plants grown under elevated atmospheric CO2 decreased, and the carbon-nitrogen (C:N) ratio increased. At the same time, increased aboveground biomass production under elevated atmospheric CO2 conditions increased the net transfer of N out of the soil of elevated-CO2 plots. Aboveground biomass production after simulated herbivory was also greater under elevated CO2 compared to ambient CO2. Surprisingly, no significant changes in belowground plant tissue N content were detected in response to elevated CO2. Measurements of individual species at peak standing phytomass showed significant effects of CO2 treatment on aboveground plant tissue N concentration and significant differences between species in N concentration, suggesting that changes in species composition under elevated CO2 will contribute to overall changes in nutrient cycling. Changes in plant N content, driven by changes in aboveground plant N concentration, could have important consequences for biogeochemical cycling rates and the long-term productivity of the shortgrass steppe as atmospheric CO2 concentrations increase.","Bouteloua gracilis; C3 grasses; C4 grasses; Carbon dioxide; Nitrogen yield; Pascopyrum smithii; Plant nitrogen; Rangelands; Stipa comata","biomass; carbon dioxide; nitrogen cycle; rangeland; steppe; Colorado; North America; United States; Bouteloua gracilis; Hesperostipa comata comata; Pascopyrum smithii; Poaceae; Stipa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842713128

Previous methodologies for modeling hazardous air pollutant emissions for onroad mobile sources are based on using spatial surrogates to allocate county level emissions to grid cells. A disadvantage of this process is that it spreads onroad emissions throughout a grid cell instead of along actual road locations. High local concentrations may be underestimated near major roadways, which are often clustered in urban centers. Here, we describe a methodology which utilizes a Geographic Information System to allocate benzene emissions to major road segments in an urban area and model the segments as elongated area sources. The Industrial Source Complex Short Term dispersion model is run using both gridded and link-based emissions to evaluate the effect of improved spatial allocation of emissions on ambient modeled benzene concentrations. Allocating onroad mobile emissions to road segments improves the agreement between modeled concentrations when compared with monitor observations, and also results in higher estimated concentrations in the urban center. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Increasing CO 2 concentration can increase photosynthetic rates. This is especially pronounced for C3 plants, at high temperatures and under water-limited conditions. Increasing temperature also affects photosynthesis, but plants have a considerable ability to adapt to their growth conditions and can function even at extremely high temperatures, provided adequate water is available. Temperature optima differ between species and growth conditions, and are higher in elevated atmospheric CO2. With increasing temperature, vapour pressure deficits of the air may increase, with a concomitant increase in the transpiration rate from plant canopies. However, if stomata close in response to increasing CO2 concentration, or if there is a reduction in the diurnal temperature range, then transpiration rates may even decrease. Soil organic matter decomposition rates are likely to be stimulated by higher temperatures, so that nutrients can be more readily mineralised and made available to plants. This is likely to increase photosynthetic carbon gain in nutrient-limited systems. All the factors listed above interact strongly so that, for different combinations of increases in temperature and CO2 concentration, and for systems in different climatic regions and primarily affected by water or nutrient limitations, photosynthesis must be expected to respond differently to the same climatic changes.","C3; C4 photosynthesis; Co2; Diurnal temperature; Photosynthesis; Rubisco; RuBP; Stomata; Temperature","carbon dioxide; water; carbon dioxide; climate change; photosynthesis; stomata; transpiration; biological model; climate; drug effect; greenhouse effect; photosynthesis; physiology; review; sweating; temperature; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Greenhouse Effect; Models, Biological; Photosynthesis; Plant Transpiration; Temperature; Water",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642525498

We have now found similar Balmer edge features in the polarized flux of four more quasars (4C09.72, 3C95, B2 1208+32, 3C323.1), and possibly a few more, out of 14 newly observed with the Very Large Telescope and the Keck Telescope. In addition, we also re-observed Ton 202, but we did not detect such a dramatic feature, apparently due to polarization variability (the two observations are 1 yr apart). The polarization measurements of some quasars are affected by an interstellar polarization in our Galaxy, but the measurements have been corrected for this effect reasonably well. As the broad emission lines are essentially unpolarized and the polarization is confined only to the continuum in the five quasars including Ton 202 in both epochs, the polarized flux is considered to originate interior to the broad emission-line region. The Balmer edge feature seen in the polarized flux is most simply interpreted as an intrinsic spectral feature of the quasar ultraviolet/optical continuum, or the 'Big Blue Bump' emission. In this case, the edge feature seen in absorption indeed indicates the thermal and optically thick nature of the continuum emitted. However, we also discuss other possible interpretations.","Accretion, accretion discs; Galaxies: active; Polarization; Quasars: general; Radiation mechanisms: general",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744232032

Predictions about its likely impact and its performance can at present only be made to a certain degree. As long as the National Allocations Plans are not finally settled the overall supply of allowances is not determined. In this paper, we will identify key features and key impacts of the EU ETS by scanning the range of likely allocation plans using the simulation model DART. The analysis of the simulation results highlights a number of interesting details in terms of allowance trade flows between member states, of allowance prices and of the role of the accession countries in the ETS. An important finding about the impact of the new ETS with respect to achieving emission reductions more efficiently, i.e. at lower cost, is that savings can only be realized if the cap on emissions is distributed between the ETS sector and the rest of the economy in such a way that the different abatement costs are taken into account. This would imply a relatively small allocation of emissions to the ETS sector. The second important result concerns the role of the accession countries. Even if they do not supply their hot air in the ETS market, they contribute substantially to the cost savings of the ETS by offering low-cost abatement options. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd and ERP Environment.",,"competitiveness; economic instrument; emission control; emissions trading; European Union; trade flow; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344609106

Oceanography, Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA, United States","Previous studies have found that idealized hurricanes, simulated under warmer, high-CO2 conditions, are more intense and have higher precipitation rates than under present-day conditions. The present study explores the sensitivity of this result to the choice of climate model used to define the CO2-warmed environment and to the choice of convective parameterization used in the nested regional model that simulates the hurricanes. Approximately 1300 five-day idealized simulations are performed using a higher-resolution version of the GFDL hurricane prediction system (grid spacing as fine as 9 km, with 42 levels). All storms were embedded in a uniform 5 m s-1 easterly background flow. The large-scale thermodynamic boundary conditions for the experiments - atmospheric temperature and moisture profiles and SSTs - are derived from nine different Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP2+) climate models. The CO 2-induced SST changes from the global climate models, based on 80-yr linear trends from + 1% yr-1 CO2 increase experiments, range from about +0.8° to +2.4°C in the three tropical storm basins studied. Four different moist convection parameterizations are tested in the hurricane model, including the use of no convective parameterization in the highest resolution inner grid. Nearly all combinations of climate model boundary conditions and hurricane model convection schemes show a CO2-induced increase in both storm intensity and near-storm precipitation rates. The aggregate results, averaged across all experiments, indicate a 14% increase in central pressure fall, a 6% increase in maximum surface wind speed, and an 18% increase in average precipitation rate within 100 km of the storm center. The fractional change in precipitation is more sensitive to the choice of convective parameterization than is the fractional change of intensity. Current hurricane potential intensity theories, applied to the climate model environments, yield an average increase of intensity (pressure fall) of 8% (Emanuel) to 16% (Holland) for the high-CO2 environments. Convective available potential energy (CAPE) is 21% higher on average in the high-CO2 environments. One implication of the results is that if the frequency of tropical cyclones remains the same over the coming century, a greenhouse gas-induced warming may lead to a gradually increasing risk in the occurrence of highly destructive category-5 storms.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Boundary conditions; Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Computer simulation; Greenhouse effect; Hurricanes; Moisture; Precipitation (meteorology); Thermodynamics; Convective available potential energy (CAPE); Greenhouse gases; Global warming; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; climate modeling; convection; parameterization; precipitation (climatology); sensitivity analysis; warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7044231527

Only the invertase and reversible sucrose synthase reactions catalyze known paths of sucrose breakdown in vivo. The regulation of these reactions and its consequences has therefore become a central issue in plant carbon metabolism. Primary mechanisms for this regulation involve the capacity of invertases to alter sugar signals by producing glucose rather than UDPglucose, and thus also two-fold more hexoses than are produced by sucrose synthase. In addition, vacuolar sites of cleavage by invertases could allow temporal control via compartmentalization. In addition, members of the gene families encoding either invertases or sucrose synthases respond at transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels to diverse environmental signals, including endogenous changes that reflect their own action (e.g. hexoses and hexose-responsive hormone systems such as abscisic acid [ABA] signaling). At the enzyme level, sucrose synthases can be regulated by rapid changes in sub-cellular localization, phosphorylation, and carefully modulated protein turnover. In addition to transcriptional control, invertase action can also be regulated at the enzyme level by highly localized inhibitor proteins and by a system that has the potential to initiate and terminate invertase activity in vacuoles. The extent, path, and site of sucrose metabolism are thus highly responsive to both internal and external environmental signals and can, in turn, dramatically alter development and stress acclimation. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The current focus of international attention is on the USA and the PRC since both countries are in a position to negate or clinch the global warming mitigation efforts of the rest of the world community and because the two governments are primarily responsible for the entrenched global impasse over greenhouse gas (GHG) abatement. This contribution illustrates how transnational non-state actors, specifically Chinese American transmigrants, can make a difference in surmounting the US-China divide over GHG emissions, even in a time of state stalemate. Specific opportunities to shape sustainable development outcomes are explored by reference to energy efficiency, renewable energy, transportation, GHG capture, and public education projects. The discussion shows that, by teaming up with the NGOs, universities, foundations and firms engaged in or contemplating involvement in GHG emission mitigation projects in China, Chinese Americans from many walks of life who can manoeuvre skilfully along the climate change frontier occupy a potentially decisive position in terms of supporting sustainable development. © 2004 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","China; Chinese Americans; Global warming; Greenhouse gas emissions; Sustainable development","carbon emission; climate change; emission control; greenhouse gas; Asia; China; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Far East; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12444317707

It also develops a typology of climate strategies that addresses the market dimensions, covering both the aim (strategic intent) and the degree of cooperation (form of organisation). The aim turns out to be either innovation or compensation, while the organisational arrangements to reach this objective can be oriented at the company level (internal), at companies' own supply chain (vertical) or at cooperation with other companies (competitors or companies in other sectors - horizontal). The typology can assist managers in deciding about the strategic option(s) they want to choose regarding climate change, also based on the insights offered by the paper about the current state of activities of other companies worldwide. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The main controversy about the Microcodium structures is their origin and possible relation with calcified plant roots. Microcodium and rhizogenic (root-formed) microfabrics were studied in calcrete profiles within the Paleocene shallow-marine carbonate succession in southwestern Slovenia. The prominent laminar calcrete horizons contain abundant calcite aggregates, 150 μm to 1 cm in size, with perfectly preserved structural details of plant root tissues. Morphology and structure of these aggregates indicate that they formed through biologically controlled precipitation of calcium carbonate within the root cortical cells. The morphologies intermediate between the typical Microcodium aggregates, composed of a single layer of individual, elongate pyramidal or prismatic crystals of calcite (measuring 100-500 μm in length and 20-70 μm in width) and calcified roots with multilayer arrangement of isodiametric cells were observed, and this supports previous rhizogenic interpretations of Microcodium structures. Intermediate forms show that the typical Microcodium aggregates formed through morphological transformation of the root tissue by growth of the calcite within the cortical cells, which distorted the cell shape. Calcification of roots and the creation of Microcodium structures can be explained as an effective nutriont-acquiring mechanism used by certain types of terrestrial plants inhabiting nutrient-poor calcareous substrates. The widespread occurrence of Microcodium in almost unaltered shallow-marine limestones indicates that its formation took place during early stages of paleosol development, probably reflecting specific types of vascular plants of a pioneer community that were able to colonize carbonate substrates during the early phases of subaerial exposure.

Deserts are under threat from development and over-grazing, and they are expanding at an alarming rate. The issue of plant use for landscape, environmental and horticultural purposes in desert environments is part and parcel of the issue of sustainable development in these regions and in the Middle East and the issue of water is a highly politicised one. It has been said that here, water and not oil is the chief threat to regional peace. There is thus a great need to find and use plants that are drought- and salinetolerant, in order to grow well and to save water. The introduction of foreign, alien species into the Negev Desert in southern Israel and elsewhere has caused enormous problems, altering ecological systems and the intrinsic character of the local landscape. The use of foreign alien species that are heat tolerant and may be drought tolerant is no longer universally acceptable. There is a critical necessity to preserve and enhance the ecological and landscape integrity of desert environments. In the Negev Desert, native plants have largely been ignored for use although they appear to offer a means towards more sustainable development and the protection and enhancement of the environment. However, the placement and type of use needs to be determined. Thus a new landscape paradigm has been developed which appears appropriate for most desert and indeed other landscape areas. This paradigm advocates the use of native plants but places this use within the context of various landscape zones found in the desert. The introduction of the ""middle landscape"" is an important zone within this model as it is here, in particular, in these in-between areas that resources such as water can be saved and where ecological and landscape values can be enhanced.","Ecology; Landscape; Sustainable development; Water; Xerophytic species",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31344463776

The extraction of lignite takes place mainly in three regions of Greece, namely Ptolemais-Amyndeon, Megalopolis and Florina. The annual production of lignite is around 60 million tons, out of which 48 million tons derive from the coal fields of northern Greece (Ptolemais-Amyndeon and Florina). Almost the entire lignite production is consumed for electricity generation, while small amounts of lignite are used for briquettes and other applications. The Greek coal-fired power plants, which are about 4500 MW, use conventional technology and they are old (an average of 30 years). In the coming years new coal fields will be exploited in Florina-another 2.5 million tons of coal-in order to satisfy the currently under construction 365MW plant located at Meliti, Florina, Northern Greece. Even though the lignite reserves are widespread in Greece and other areas such as Elassona and Drama could possibly host power plants, it is expected that the Florina power plant will be the last coalfired plant to be build in the country. Lignite has to compete with natural gas-the construction of the main gas pipeline network has been completed-imported oil and renewable energy sources. The new EU regulations on power plant emissions raise obstacles for the firing of lignite, although it is low in sulphur. It must be shown that lignite produces low cost electricity in a environmentally friendly manner. The utilization of fly ash and land reclamation can improve the situation in lignite mining. In particular, specific attention was paid to further research and potential use of fly ash in road construction, the production of bricks and concrete, and the production of zeolites from lignitic fly ash. The use of clean coal technologies in power plants can solve many emission problems. Specific measures to increase the efficiency of lignite-fired power units might include: identification of the loss sources of every unit, improvement of the cold end of the steam turbines, optimization of the beater wheel mills operation, and the combination of natural gas-fired turbines with the existing boilers. The liberalization of the electricity market needs to be considered seriously from the lignite industry, since the potential electricity producers can freely choose from all kinds of fuels, such as imported coal, oil, gas and renewables. However, Greek lignite meets the requirements for the security of supply, as indicated in the EU's Green Paper. It needs only to be competitive in the new energy sector by improving mining and combustion conditions. Further research on these topics, through the European Commission's ECSC and Framework Programmes, as well as the national programmes, is required. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","CCTs potential; Electricity generation; Lignite reserves; Power plants status","Electric power plants; Lignite; Natural gas; Regulatory compliance; Energy sectors; Power plant emissions; Electric power generation; electricity generation; future prospect; hydrocarbon reserve; lignite; power plant; Eurasia; Europe; Greece; Southern Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042849261

Determining which power generation technologies are most suitable for meeting the demand of a particular region requires analysis of tradeoffs between costs and environmental impacts. Models simulating different power generation technologies can help quantify these tradeoffs. An Internet-based modelling infrastructure called DOME (distributed object-based modelling environment) provides a flexible mechanism to create integrated models from independent simulation models for different power generation technologies. As new technologies appear, corresponding simulation models can readily be added to the integrated model. DOME was used to combine a simulation model for hybrid SOFC (solid oxide fuel cell) and gas turbine system with a power generation capacity and dispatch optimization model. The integrated models were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the system as a centralized power source for meeting the power demand in Japan. Evaluation results indicate that a hybrid system using micro-tube SOFC may reduce CO2 emissions from power generation in Japan by about 50%. © 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.","Centralized power generation; Internet-based modelling; Model integration; Object-based modelling; Power generation dispatching; SOFC; SOFC/GT system; Solid oxide fuel cell","Computer simulation; Costs; Electricity; Environmental impact; Internet; Mathematical models; Power generation; Urban planning; Centralized power sources; Urban regions; Solid oxide fuel cells; fuel cell; gas turbine; hybrid system; mathematical modeling; power generation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0442312920

The presented TEM-model describes the economical interaction between several actors (players) who intend to minimize their emissions (Ei) caused by technologies (Ti) by means of expenditures of money (Mi) or financial means, respectively. The index stands for the ith player, i = 1,..., n. The players are linked by technical cooperations and the market, which expresses itself in the nonlinear time-discrete dynamics of the Technology-Emissions- Means-model, in short: TEM-model. In the sense of environmental protection, the aim is to reach a state which is mentioned in the Kyoto Protocol by choosing the control parameters such that the emissions of each player become minimized. The focal point is the realization of the necessary optimal control parameters via a played cost game, which is determined by the way of cooperation of the actors. In application to the work of G. Leitmann [1974], but not regarding solution sets as feasible sets, the τ-value of S. H. Tijs and T. S. H. Driessen [1986] is taken as a control parameter. This leads to a new class of problems in the area of 1-convex games. We want to solve the problem by a non-cooperative and cooperative treatment. We prove that the core which is gained by cooperation of the players is nonempty and can be used as feasible set for our control problem. With this solution a reasonable model for a Joint-Implementation process is developed, where its necessary fund is represented by the non-empty core of the analyzed game. Steering with parameters of this feasible set, the TEM-model can be regarded as a useful tool to implement and verify a technical Joint-Implementation Program. For the necessary data given to the Clearing House (http://www.unfccc.org/ resource/convkp.html) we are able to compare the numerical results with real world phenomena.","Cooperative and noncooperative treatment; Feasible set; TEM-model; Time-discrete dynamical game",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13844313774

Using the sector specific unit conceptualization of an IO table, one can consider the effect of changes in direct input coefficients for a particular sector on the complete set of total input coefficients independently from the other direct input coefficients. A process system modelling based method for calculating the total industrial outputs from a new technology matrix together with the new relative prices for each sector output is presented.

Weights assigned to prior information and to CO2 concentrations at different locations are quantified by parameters that are not well known, and differences in the choice of these parameters contribute to differences among published estimates of the regional partitioning of CO2 fluxes. Following the TransCom 3 protocol to estimate CO2 fluxes for 1992-1996, we find that the partitioning of the CO2 sink between land and oceans and between North America and Eurasia depends on parameters that quantify the relative weight given to prior flux estimates and the extent to which CO2 concentrations at different stations are differentially weighted. Parameter values that minimize an estimated prediction error can be chosen by generalized cross-validation (GCV). The GCV parameter values yield fluxes in northern regions similar to those obtained with the TransCom parameter values, but the GCV fluxes are smaller in the poorly constrained equatorial and southern regions.

Calculations of the possible effect on CO2 reduction by PV energy systems may be incorrect if system borders are not set wide enough and remain on a national level, as can be found in the literature. For the examples of Brazil and Germany, the effective CO2 reductions have been derived, also considering possible interchange scenarios for production and operation of the PV systems considering the carbon dioxide intensity of the local electricity grids. In the case of Brazil also off-grid applications and the substitution of diesel generating sets by photovoltaics are examined: CO2 reduction may reach 26,805 kg/kWp in that case. Doing these calculations, the compositions of the local grids and their CO2 intensity at the time of PV grid injection have to be taken into account. Also possible changes of the generation fuel mix in the future have to be considered: During the operation time of a PV system, different kinds of power plants could be installed that might change the CO2 intensity of the grid.

The impact melt and breccias in the Yax-1 borehole are 100 m thick, which is approximately 1/5 the thickness of breccias and melts exposed in the Yucatán-6 exploration hole, which is also thought to be located between the peak ring and final rim of the Chicxulub crater. The sequence and composition of impact melts and breccias are grossly similar to those in the Yucatán-6 hole.

The melt in the Yax-1 hole was produced largely from the silicate basement lithologies that lie beneath a 3 km- thick carbonate platform in the target area. Small amounts of immiscible molten carbonate were ejected with the silicate melt, and clastic carbonate often forms the matrix of the polymict breccias. The melt unit appears to have been deposited while molten but brecciated after solidification. The melt fragments in the polymict breccias appear to have solidified in flight, before deposition, and fractured during transport and deposition. © Meteoritical Society, 2004.",,"Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary; impact structure; lithology; Atlantic Ocean; Bay of Campeche; Chicxulub Crater; Gulf of Mexico; Yucatan Peninsula",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3943080586

Airflow, CO2, cerebral blood flow velocity (CBF), ECG, and blood pressure (BP) were recorded. To determine whether influences of mean BP (MBP) and systolic SP (SBP) on CBF were altered in presyncopal subjects, coherencies and transfer functions between these variables and mean and peak CBF (CBF m, and CBFp) were estimated. To determine the influence of end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) on CBF, the relative CO2 reactivity (%change in CBFm per mmHg change in ETCO2) was calculated. We found that in presyncopal subjects before symptoms during HUT, coherence between SBP and CBFp was higher (P = 0.02) and gains of transfer functions between BP (MBP and SBP) and CBFm, were larger (MBP, P = 0.01; SBP, P = 0.01) in the respiratory frequency region. In the last 3 min before presyncope, presyncopals had a reduced relative CO2 reactivity (P = 0.005), likely a consequence of the larger decrease in ETCO 2. We hypothesize that the CO2-mediated increase in resistance attenuates autoregulation such that the relationship between systemic and cerebral hemodynamics is enhanced. Our results suggest that an altered cardiorespiratory interaction involving cerebral hemodynamics may contribute in the cascade of events during tilt that culminate in unexplained syncope.","Cerebral autoregulation; Respiratory frequency region","adult; airflow; article; autoregulation; blood storage; brain blood flow; breathing; cardiopulmonary hemodynamics; controlled study; electrocardiogram; female; head tilting; human; human experiment; male; normal human; priority journal; syncope; Adult; Blood Pressure; Cerebrovascular Circulation; Female; Heart Rate; Homeostasis; Humans; Hypotension, Orthostatic; Male; Posture; Respiratory Mechanics; Syncope; Tilt-Table Test",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844245779

Insight into the regional variability of nitrate concentrations, to support local policy on emission abatement strategies is especially desirable. In this paper, three methods for the calculation of a spatial distribution of soil nitrate concentrations in Dutch forest ecosystems are compared. These are (i) a regression model based on observed nitrate concentrations and additional data on explanatory variables such as soil type, tree species and nitrogen deposition (ii) a semi-empirical dynamic model Wanda, and (iii) a process-oriented dynamic model Smart2. These two dynamic models are frequently used to evaluate the effects of reductions in nitrogen deposition at scales ranging from regional to countrywide. The results of the regression model evaluated the performance of the two dynamic models. Furthermore, the results of the three methods are compared with the steady-state approach currently used for the derivation of nitrogen critical loads. Both dynamic models, in the form of cumulative distribution functions, give similar results on a national scale. Regional variability is predicted differently by both models. Discrepancies are caused mainly by a difference in handling forest filtering and denitrification. All three methods show that, despite the high nitrogen inputs, Dutch forests still accumulate more N than they release. This implies that, in respect of groundwater quality, presently acceptable nitrogen deposition is higher than the (long-term) critical loads. However, in areas with high atmospheric nitrogen input, all three methods indicate that the EU standard for nitrate in groundwater (50 mg NO3 1-1) is exceeded. Steady-state with nitrogen deposition seems to have been reached in about 10% of the forested area, with a nitrate concentration greater than 50 mg NO3 1 -1. © EGU.","Critical load; Model validation; Soil modelling; Up-scaling","forest soil; leaching; nitrate; numerical model",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13444255977

We used an elevation gradient in Colorado Rocky Mountain subalpine forest to examine climate and species effects on dead wood biomass, and on CWD decay rate. Using a new radiocarbon approach, we determined that the turnover time of lodgepole pine CWD (340±130 years) was roughly half as long in a site with 2.5-3°C warmer air temperature, as that of pine (630 ±400 years) or Engelmann spruce CWD (800±960 and 650±410 years) in cooler sites. Across all sites and both species, CWD age ranged from 2 to 600 years, and turnover time was 580±180 years. Total standing and fallen dead wood biomass ranged from 4.7±0.2 to 54 ±1 Mg ha -1, and from 2.8 to 60% of aboveground live tree biomass. Dead wood biomass increased 75 kg ha-1 per meter gain in elevation and decreased 13 Mg ha-1 for every degree C increase in mean air temperature. Differences in biomass and decay rates along the elevation gradient suggest that climate warming will lead to a loss of dead wood carbon from subalpine forest. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Climate; Coarse woody debris; Decomposition; Ecosystem carbon balance; Subalpine forest","carbon; rain; air temperature; carbon balance; coarse woody debris; dead wood; decomposition; elevation; forest ecosystem; altitude; article; biomass; comparative study; ecosystem; metabolism; temperature; time; United States; wood; Altitude; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Radioisotopes; Colorado; Ecosystem; Rain; Temperature; Time Factors; Wood; Colorado; North America; Rocky Mountains; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Picea; Picea engelmannii; Pinus contorta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144305272

Anthraquinone-2, 6-disulfonate, an electron shuttle, was present in the media. Experiments were performed without and with PO43- (P) (1 to 20 mmol/L) in media containing 50 mmol/L Fe. Our objectives were to define the combined effects of SiO44- (Si) and P on the bioreducibility and biomineralization of ferrihydrites under anoxic conditions. Iron reduction was measured as a function of time, solids were characterized by powder X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy, and aqueous solutions were analyzed for Si, P, Cl- and inorganic carbon. Both of the ferrihydrites were rapidly reduced regardless of the Si and P content. Si concentration had no effect on the reduction rate or mineralization products. Magnetite was formed in the absence of P whereas carbonate green rust GR(CO32-) ([Fe(6-x) IIFeIIIx(OH)12]x+ (CO32-) 0.5x · yH2O) and vivianite [Fe3 (PO4)2 · 8H2O], were formed when P was present. GR(CO32-) dominated as a mineral product in samples with &lt;4 mmol/L P. The Fe(II)/Fe(III) ratio of GR(CO32-) varied with P concentration; the ratio was 2 in 1 mmol/L P and approached 1 with 4- and 10 mmol/L P. Green rust appeared to form by solid-state transformation of ferrihydrite. Media P and Si concentration dictated the mechanism of transformation. In the 1 mole % Si coprecipitate with 1 mmol/L P, an intermediate Fe(II)/Fe(III) phase with structural Fe(II) slowly transformed to GR with time. In contrast, when ferrihydrite contained more Si (5 mole %) and/or contained higher P (4 mmol/L), sorbed Fe(II) and residual ferrihydrite together transformed to GR. Despite similar chemistries, P was shown to have a profound effect on extent of ferrihydrite reduction and biotransformations while that of Si was minimal. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.",,"biotransformation; ferrihydrite; iron-reducing bacterium; microbial activity; phosphate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842652298

The structures of the reaction intermediates in the single turnover of the NO reduction by NOR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa were investigated using optical absorption and EPR spectroscopies combined with an originally designed freeze-quench device. In the EPR spectrum of the sample, in which the fully reduced NOR was mixed with an NO solution and quenched at 0.5 ms after the mixing, two characteristic signals for the ferrous FeB-NO and the penta-coordinated ferrous heme b 3-NO species were observed. The CO inhibition of its formation indicated that two NO molecules were simultaneously distributed into the two irons of the same binuclear center of the enzyme in this state. The time- and temperature-dependent EPR spectral changes indicated that the species that appeared at 0.5 ms is a transient reaction intermediate prior to the N 2O formation, in good agreement with the so-called ""irons"" mechanism. It was also found that the final state of the enzyme in the single turnover cycle is the fully oxidized state, in which the μ-oxo-bridged ligand is absent between the two irons of its binuclear center, unlike the resting form of NOR as isolated. On the basis of these present findings, we propose a newly developed mechanism for the NO reduction reaction conducted by NOR.",,"Bacteria; Catalysis; Denitrification; Light absorption; Molecular structure; Paramagnetic resonance; Quenching; Reduction; Spectroscopic analysis; Binuclear centers; EPR spectral; Ligands; Nitric-oxide reductase (NOR); Enzymes; nitric oxide; nitric oxide reductase; nitrous oxide; article; bacterial metabolism; catalysis; electron spin resonance; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; priority journal; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; reaction analysis; reduction; temperature dependence; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Freezing; Heme; Iron; Ligands; Magnetics; Models, Chemical; Nitric Oxide; Oxidoreductases; Pseudomonas aeruginosa; Spectrophotometry; Temperature; Time Factors; Bacteria (microorganisms); Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas aeruginosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11244302439

This gives rise to the tantalizing possibility that radio emission can be produced in the vicinity of such mini-magnetospheres, since it is well known that radio emissions are directly associated with the foreshock regions of planetary bow shocks and travelling interplanetary shocks. In this letter, we generalize a theoretical model for foreshock radio emissions in order to determine whether observable radio fluxes can also be generated near mini-magnetospheres. We show that, when applied specifically to the Moon, this model predicts that mini-magnetospheres should produce radio fluxes above current instrument sensitivity limits. Moreover, the predicted strong dependence of the radio emission on the upstream plasma properties may have important implications for the model's applicability to other planetary satellites.

The experiments were carried out at 873 and 973 K and at holding times ranging from 0 to 120 min using a laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor, and the solid-solid reaction between the Ca-based sorbents and the coal-included minerals during the steam gasification was investigated. Local scanning electron microscopy-energy- dispersive X-ray analysis of the solid residues obtained under different conditions showed that some constituents of the coal-included minerals, such as Si and Al, were contained in the sorbent particles. The solid-solid interaction between the Ca-based sorbents and coal-included minerals became significant at the higher temperature and at longer holding periods. This interaction will locally decrease the CO2 sorption ability of the sorbents. However, when a holding time of less than 10 min was employed, the solid-solid reaction between the minerals and the sorbents was suppressed, even at 973 K, because the rate of formation of inorganic compounds through solid-solid reaction was low. In this case, our target carbon conversion (about 50%) was attainable, owing to the devolatilization during the heating period. Our results indicate that the holding time of the feedstock in the reactor should be shortened to avoid deactivation of the Ca-based sorbents during high-pressure steam gasification.",,"Coal gasification; Comminution; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Feedstocks; High pressure effects; Reaction kinetics; Scanning electron microscopy; Sorption; X ray analysis; Fixed-bed reactors; Holding time; Solid-solid interactions; Sorbents; Bituminous coal; aluminum; calcium; carbon dioxide; coal; silicon; Coal; fixed bed; Gasification; article; chemical procedures; fixed bed reactor; gasification; heating; hyperbarism; molecular interaction; scanning electron microscopy; solid state; temperature dependence; volatilization; water vapor; X ray analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9744267404

To assess the potential impact of the environmental change associated with CO2 sequestration in the ocean, we studied the lethal and sub-lethal effects of raised CO2 concentration in seawater on adult and early stage embryos of marine planktonic copepods. We found that the reproduction rate and larval development of copepods are very sensitive to increased CO2 concentration. The hatching rate tended to decrease, and nauplius mortality rate to increase, with increased CO2 concentration. These results suggest that the marine copepod community will be negatively affected by the disposal of CO2. This could decrease on the carbon export flux to the deep ocean and change the biological pump.

We no longer justify the theatre on grounds of spiritual nourishment, intellectual stimulus or communal pleasure: We talk inevitably of “an important strand in our export drive’ and of “quick and sizeable returns’ that will follow an increase in arts funding. As Michael Billington indicates here, some of the main developments in British theatre since 1979 did not originate with aesthetics but rather with ideology and economics. Theatre has been a business for centuries, of course, even if its institutional and financial basis was often invisible in the discussion of performances, but it is unlikely that Billington could have written this any earlier in the post-World War Two period. He registers a process of commodification, in which the relationships between plays, practitioners, writers and audiences have become defined by the terms of free-market economics. As a result, from about the early 1980s justifications for theatre as a cultural practice became increasingly determined by its value as a commercial activity, with profound consequences for the kinds of theatre that were produced in the final decades of the twentieth century. The processes considered here are complex, and to discuss them will involve looking first at the political context for the changing relationship of theatre to commerce and the state, in a climate dominated by government intervention to introduce monetarism and major structural changes to the British economy. This included the forging of a new partnership between “public’ and “private’ sources of funding. The kind of theatre that was produced as a result will then be considered, as will some of the most significant political and cultural consequences of commodification. © Cambridge University Press 2004 and 2008.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883886522

In September, the two branches were separately labelled with 14CO2 and 13CO2, respectively, so that the photosynthates from each branch could be traced independently at the same time. Although some carbon movements could be detected within 5 d in both directions (including from the shaded branch to the sun branch), between-branch carbon movements were very limited: approximately 1% of the diurnal net assimilation of a branch. At this time of the year branch autonomy was nearly total, leading to increased relative respiratory losses and a moderate growth deficit in the shaded branch. The ratio of growth to reserve storage rate was only slightly affected, indicating that reserves acted not as a mere buffer for excess C but as an active sink for assimilates. In winter, branch autonomy was more questionable, as significant amounts of carbon were imported into both branches, possibly representing up to 10% of total branch reserves. Further within-plant carbon transfers occurred in spring, which totally abolished plant autonomy, as new shoots sprouted on each branch received significantly more C mobilized from tree-wide reserves than from local, mother-branch located reserves. This allowed great flexibility of tree response to environment changes at the yearly time scale. As phloem is considered not functional in winter, it is suggested that xylem is involved as the pathway for carbohydrate movements at this time of the year. This is in agreement with other results regarding sugar exchanges between the xylem vessels and the neighbouring reserve parenchyma tissues.","Allocation; Balance; Carbohydrate; Carbon; Mobilization; Reserve; Tree","resource allocation; Juglans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544363933

We find that the former are barely distinguishable from the background emission of the active region, while the coronal emission of loops is confined in well-identifiable structures that are significantly brighter than the background. This result means that the vast majority of the active region emission in chromospheric and transition region lines is generated by plasma not directly connected with the coronal plasma that constitutes the observed coronal loops. We determine the observed intensities of coronal lines relative to the observed transition region and chromospheric emission and compare them with predictions from loop models having uniform cross section and different heating functions. We find that the loop models overestimate the footpoint emission by orders of magnitude. We discuss the discrepancy in light of the heating function and of the loop cross section. We speculate that nonuniformity in the loop cross section, more specifically a significant decrease of the cross section near the footpoints, is the most likely solution to the discrepancy.","MHD; Plasmas; Sun: corona; Sun: magnetic fields",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5644246548

For peat and organic soils critical loads have been set according to a pH criterion. Together these approaches have been used with national datasets to examine the potential scale of acidification in woodland habitats across the UK. The results can be mapped to show the spatial variability in critical loads of the three principal woodland habitat types (managed coniferous, managed broadleaved/ mixed woodland and unmanaged woodland). The results suggest that there is a wide range of critical loads. The most sensitive (lowest) critical loads are associated with managed coniferous followed by unmanaged woodland on peat soils. Calculations indicate that at steady state, acid deposition inputs reported for 1995-1997 result in a large proportion of all the woodland habitats identified receiving deposition loads in excess of their critical load; i.e. critical loads are exceeded. These are discussed in relation to future modelled depositions for 2010. Whilst significant widespread negative impacts of such deposition on UK woodland habitats have not been reported, the work serves to illustrate that if acid deposition inputs were maintained and projected emissions reductions not achieved, the long-term sustainability of large areas of woodland in the UK could be compromised. © EGU.","Acid deposition; Acidification; Critical loads; Simple mass balance model; Sustainability; Woodland","acidification; atmospheric deposition; atmospheric pollution; critical load; pollution effect; woodland; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Europe; United Kingdom; Western Europe; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8644258281

All externally specified fields are constant over the year, zonally symmetric and symmetric about the equator. The amplitude of a specified ocean heat transport is varied and within a certain range a number of distinctly different stationary states are found: An ice-covered planet, a ""cold"" climate, a ""present-day""-like climate and an ice-free ""warm"" climate.

The realization that the concept of globalization includes global exposure to disease-causing agents that were formerly confined to small, remote areas and that infectious disease outbreaks can have political, economic and social roots and effects is becoming more apparent. Novel infectious disease microbes continue to be discovered because they are new or newly recognized, have expanded their geographic range, have been shown to cause a new disease spectrum, have jumped the species barrier from animals to humans, have become resistant to antimicrobial agents, have increased in incidence or have become more virulent. These emerging infectious disease microbes may have the potential for use as agents of bioterrorism. Factors involved in the emergence of infectious diseases are complex and interrelated and involve all classifications of organisms transmitted in a variety of ways. In 2003, outbreaks of interest included severe acute respiratory syndrome, monkeypox and avian influenza. Information from the human genome project applied to microbial organisms and their hosts will provide new opportunities for detection, diagnosis, treatment, prevention, control and prognosis. New technology related not only to genetics but also to satellite and monitoring systems will play a role in weather, climate and the approach to environmental manipulations that influence factors contributing to infectious disease emergence and control. Approaches to combating emerging infectious diseases include many disciplines, such as animal studies, epidemiology, immunology, ecology, environmental studies, microbiology, pharmacology, other sciences, health, medicine, public health, nursing, cultural, political and social studies, all of which must work together. Appropriate financial support of the public health infrastructure including surveillance, prevention, communication, adherence techniques and the like will be needed to support efforts to address emerging infectious disease threats. © Future Drugs Ltd.

Earthworms Aporrectodea caliginosa, Lumbricus terrestris and Eisenia fetida were collected during the spring and summer of 2000 and 2001 from meadow sites situated between 2 and 32 km from the Bukowno-Olkusz complex of zinc-lead ore mines and smelters. The heavy metal content in the soil near smelters reaches 10,500 mg/kg (d.w.) for Zn, 2600 mg/kg for Pb and 81.9 mg/kg for Cd. The sites differ with respect to species composition of earthworm community, with A. caliginosa being dominant. Complete data was obtained only for A. caliginosa, since other species were not abundant at all investigated sites during the whole period of investigation. The body burdens of Zn, Pb, Cd and Cu in A. caliginosa reached 1500, 100, 220 and 10 μg/g, respectively, in the vicinity of the smelter (2-4 km), and decreased to 400, 2, 36 and 6 μg/g at the most distant site (32 km). Cadmium and lead content was significantly elevated in the whole body of L. terrestris collected at the site 2.5 km distant from the smelters when compared to more distant sites, while in E. fetida only the body burden of cadmium was elevated at the nearest site compared to the next site of transect. Activities of glutathione peroxidase (GPX; EC 1.11.1.9) against hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) or cumene hydroperoxide (cumOOH), glutathione reductase (GR; EC 1.6.4.2), glutathione S-transferase (GST; EC 2.5.1.18) and catalase (CAT; EC 1.11.1.6) were assayed in postmitochondrial supernatant obtained from whole body homogenates. Seasonal and annual variations of enzyme activity were reflected by higher GPX activity in the late summer of 2001 in comparison with the spring and summer of 2000. This may reflect severe drought in the spring and summer of 2000. The activity of both GPX isozymes, GR and GST in A. caliginosa and L. terrestris increased with increasing distance from the smelters and reached maximum at sites III and IV (4 and 8 km from the smelters, respectively) and then it decreased in the animals from site V (32 km). These may be the effects of antagonism between the enzyme inducing and enzyme inhibiting action of smelter emissions, a phenomenon known as a hormetic effect. It is postulated here that this effect is of diagnostic value for metal pollution biomonitoring. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The 'Episode Project' in northern Sweden found a consistent relationship between the SO4 2- concentration of snow and the anthropogenic component of acid neutralization capacity (ANC) decline during spring flood. This correlation creates the possibility for a regional prediction of the severity of anthropogenic episodic acidification during spring flood episodes using SO 42- deposition data together with chemical data from 1240 lakes selected to be representative of northern Sweden. The regional assessment found that in 1998, ca 6% of the region was seriously affected by anthropogenic acidification during spring flood.

Biofilms were cultivated in rotating annular reactors with river water at a DO concentration of 0.5 or 7.5 mg liter-1, with or without a combination of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus (CNP) and with or without Ni at 0.5 mg liter-1. The effects of Ni were apparent in the elimination of cyanobacterial populations and reduced photosynthetic biomass in the biofilm. Application of lectin-binding analyses indicated changes in exopolymer abundance and a shift in the glycoconjugate makeup of the biofilms, as well as in the response to all treatments. Application of the fluorescent live-dead staining (BacLight Live-Dead staining kit; Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oreg.) indicated an increase in the ratio of live to dead cells under low-oxygen conditions. Nickel treatments had 50 to 75% fewer 'live' cells than their corresponding controls. Nickel at 0.5 mg liter-1 corresponding to the industrial release rate concentration for nickel resulted in reductions in carbon utilization spectra relative to control and CNP treatments without nickel. In these cases, the presence of nickel eliminated the positive influence of nutrients on the biofilm. Other culture-dependent analyses (plate counts and most probable number) revealed no significant treatment effect on the biofilm communities. In the presence of CNP and at both DO levels, Ni negatively affected denitrification but had no effect on hexadecane mineralization or sulfate reduction. Analysis of total community DNA indicated abundant eubacterial 16S ribosomal DNA (rDNA), whereas Archaea were not detected. Amplification of the alkB gene indicated a positive effect of CNP and a negative effect of Ni. The nirS gene was not detected in samples treated with Ni at 0.5 mg liter -1, indicating a negative effect on specific populations of bacteria, such as denitrifiers, resulting in a reduction in diversity. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed that CNP had a beneficial impact on biofilm bacterial diversity at high DO concentrations, but none at low DO concentrations, and that the negative effect of Ni on diversity was similar at both DO concentrations. Notably, Ni resulted in the appearance of unique bands in 16S rDNA from Ni, DO, and CNP treatments. Sequencing results confirmed that the bands belonged to bacteria originating from freshwater and marine environments or from agricultural soils and industrial effluents. The observations indicate that significant interactions occur between Ni, oxygen, and nutrients and that Ni at 0.5 mg liter-1 may have significant impacts on river microbial community diversity and function.",,"Agriculture; Biodiversity; Dissolution; Molecular structure; Nickel; Oxygen; Rivers; Soils; Microbial communities; Molecular assessment; Biofilms; carbon; glycoconjugate; industrial effluent; lectin; nickel; nitrogen; oxygen; phosphorus; ribosome DNA; river water; sulfate; microbiology; agriculture; Archaebacterium; article; binding affinity; biodiversity; biofilm; biomass; carbon utilization; chemical composition; concentration response; Cyanobacterium; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; denitrification; freshwater environment; gene; marine environment; metal binding; mineralization; nirS gene; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; nutrient; photosynthesis; plate count; protein function; protein structure; reactor; river ecosystem; rotation; soil; structure activity relation; Biofilms; Carbon; DNA, Bacterial; Nickel; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Oxygen; Phosphorus; Rivers; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms); Cyanobacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242781033

Demand for natural gas will nearly double to 4.9 trillion cu m over 2002-2030, while coal use will increase by 50% to 7 billion ton by that time. Demand for renewable sources of energy, including geothermal, solar, wind, tidal, and wave energy, will grow faster than ay other energy source at 5.7%/yr, but their share of world demand in 2030 will be only 2%. Nuclear power will grow slightly, decreasing in Europe and increasing in Asia. There also will be rapid expansion of the worldscale capacity of gas-to-liquids plants, bringing a sharp increase in the supply of clean diesel. All of the net oil-importing regions, most notably the three OECD regions and developing Asia, will become increasingly dependent on imports. Global demand for gas will increase 2.3%/yr, largely for electric power. The WEO gives much attention to an estimated 1.7%/yr increase in global CO2 emissions over 2002-2030. Nearly 70% of the increase will come from developing countries.

The analysis highlights that proper time series methods can aid in optimal regulatory policy as well as developing empirical verification of theories put forth to explain economic phenomena. In addition, several interesting results emerge. First, we find that the emissions series contains both a permanent and random component. Second, if one attributed all of the emissions reductions to regulatory policy, intervention analysis suggests that the 1970 Clean Air Act (CAA) did not merely have transitory effects, but permanently influenced the NO x emission path. In terms of total regulatory impact, an upper bound on the emissions saved due to the 1970 CAA is in the range of 27%-48%.","emissions; intervention analyses; time-series models","Econometric methods; Resource economics; Transitory effects; Air pollution; Environmental impact; Nitrogen oxides; Public policy; Standards; Sustainable development; Aquaculture; atmospheric pollution; nitrogen oxides; pollution control; regulatory framework; time series analysis; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843095991

Small red-shifts in the two primary absorption bands of naphthalene and pyrene were observed in the presence of high concentrations of Ag+, indicating that ground-state cation-aromatic π electron interactions occurred. Ag+ complexation constants (K1 and K2) for naphthalene were determined directly from steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence data, whereas the formation of a pyrene-Ag+ exciplex required an additional correction to remove its interference on apparent pyrene complexation constants. The correction utilized ratios of the exciplex and monomer preexponential factors obtained from pyrene fluorescence decay curves measured at several emission wavelengths that were impacted to different degrees by the exciplex emission. The novel approach developed here to quantify ground-state complexes between Ag+ and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) offers new opportunities to investigate weak metal-organic complexes such as those resulting from cation-π interactions. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Air pollutants emitted from ten types of commonly used incense manufactured in different regions were compared. The target pollutants included particulate matters (PM10, PM2.5), volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbonyls, carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), methane (CH4) and non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC). The particulate matters emitted from all the incense significantly exceeded the Recommended Indoor Air Quality Objectives for Office Buildings and Public Places in Hong Kong (HKIAQO). The CO peak levels of seven incense types greatly exceeded the HKIAQO standard. The formaldehyde concentrations of six types of incense were higher than the HKIAQO. The highest formaldehyde level exceeded the standard by 2 times. The results indicated that the concentrations of benzene, toluene, methyl chloride and methylene chloride significantly increased with the burning of all incense tested. In addition, the benzene concentrations of all tested incense were significantly higher than the HKIAQO standard. Although Incense 2 and 6 were claimed to be environmental friendly, the quantity of the pollutants emitted was not observed to be lower than the others. It was observed that when comparing the gas pollutant emission factors between two major incense categories (i.e. traditional and aromatic), the traditional incense (i.e. Incense 1-6) had relatively higher values than aromatic incense (i.e. Incense 7-9). Generally, it was found that the VOCs emitted sequence was aromatic incense&gt;tradition incense&gt;church incense (i.e. Incense 10). However, the carbonyl compounds emission sequence was traditional incense&gt;aromatic incense&gt;church incense. The results show that incense burning is one of the important indoor air pollution sources for PM, CO and VOCs. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The ionic composition of PM2.5 aerosol was dominated by sulfate (SO42−) and ammonium (NH4+). Daily average SO42− and NH4+ concentrations were strongly correlated (R2= 0.94). The molar ratio of NH4+ to SO42− averaged 1.54, consistent with concurrent measurements of aerosol acidity. The aerosol was observed to be comprised of a submicron fine mode consisting primarily of ammoniated SO42− and a coarse particle mode containing nitrate (NO3−). The NO3− appears to be primarily associated with sea salt particles where chloride has been replaced by NO3−, although formation of calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2) is important, too, on several days. Size-resolved aerosol composition results reveal that a size cut in particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤1 μm would have provided a much better separation of fine and coarse aerosol modes than the standard PM2.5 size cut utilized for the study. Although considerable nitric acid exists in the gas phase at Big Bend, the aerosol is sufficiently acidic and temperatures sufficiently high that even significant future reductions in PM2.5 SO42− are unlikely to be offset by formation of particulate ammonium nitrate in summer or fall. © 2004 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"Aerodynamics; Ammonia; Calcium compounds; Correlation methods; Nitric acid; Particulate emissions; Aerodynamic diameter; Big bend; Ionic composition; Aerosols; ammonia; sulfate; acidity; aerosol; air pollution; article; chemical composition; environmental impact assessment; forest; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2142757238

The used GR(CO32-) samples were made of either suspended solid in solution or a thin electrochemically formed layer on the surface of an iron disc. Depending on experimental conditions, oxidation occurs, with or without major modifications of the GR(CO32-) structure, suggesting the existence of two pathways: solid-state oxidation (SSO) leading to a ferric oxyhydroxycarbonate as the end product, and a dissolution-oxidation-precipitation (DOP) mechanism leading to ferric oxihydroxides such as lepidocrocite, goethite, or ferrihydrite. A formula was proposed for this ferric oxyhydroxycarbonate, Fe6IIIO(2+x)(OH)(12-2x) (H2O)x(CO3), assuming that the solid-state oxidation reaction is associated to a deprotonation of the water molecules within the interlayers, or of the hydroxyl groups in the Fe(O,H) octahedra layers. The DOP mechanism involves transformation via solution with the occurrence of soluble ferrous-ferric intermediate species. A discussion about factors influencing the oxidation of carbonate green rust is provided hereafter. The ferric oxyhydroxycarbonate can be reduced back to GR(CO32-) by a reverse solid-state reduction reaction. The potentiality for a solid-state redox cycling of iron to occur may be considered. The stability of the ferric oxyhydroxycarbonate towards thermodynamically stable ferric phases, such as goethite and hematite, was also studied.

To assess the extent of exposure for Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) among nonoccupationally exposed commuters in Mexico City. Material and Methods. Blood concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m-/p-xylene, o-xylene and methyl tert-butyl ether were determined on samples collected from participants after the morning commute. Results. Median blood concentrations of benzene (0.11 μg/l), ethylbenzene (0.081 μg/l), m-/p-xylene (0.32 μg/l) and toluene (0.56 μg/l) in the Mexico City participants were all approximately two times higher than in a nonsmoking subset of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey population of the United States. On the other hand, median VOC blood levels were similar to medians observed in other studies involving commuters in specific U.S. cities, despite the fact that only half the Mexico City study participants commuted by personal vehicles compared with all U.S. commuters. Conclusions. These results reflect the extent of the air pollution problem in Mexico City. The surrounding topography exacerbates the problems caused by heavy vehicular traffic, poor emission-control devices on older vehicles, and poor maintenance practices. Elevated levels of gasoline components in the blood of nonoccupationally exposed commuters emphasize the need for regulatory initiatives and mass-transit options to reduce hydrocarbon emissions and thus reduce the risk for nonoccupational exposure for the residents of Mexico City.","Benzene; Blood benzene levels; Commuters; Mexico; Volatile organic compounds","benzene; ethylbenzene; gasoline; meta xylene; ortho xylene; para xylene; tert butyl methyl ether; toluene; volatile organic compound; adult; air pollution; air pollution control; article; blood analysis; blood level; car; city; commuter; controlled study; environmental exposure; female; government regulation; human; male; Mexico; normal human; traffic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842430496

We investigate multidirectional feedback between these countries, and hence the error inherent in a single-region input-output model. We also examine the effect of aggregation on the model results. In the case of Denmark, an 11 Mt CO2 trade surplus resulting from a single-region model turns into balance when multidirectional trade is considered.

Design: Experimental study in a pig model of lung lavage induced acute lung injury. Setting: University research laboratory. Measurements and results: Tidal volumes of 6, 8 and 10 ml/kg body weight with a set respiratory rate of 20 breaths per minute were used in a random order with both double-lumen ventilation and standard endotracheal tube ventilation. Measurements of ventilatory and circulatory parameters were obtained after steady state at each experimental stage. With a tidal volume of 6 ml/kg, PaCO2 was reduced from 10.9 kPa (95% CI 9.0-12.9) with a standard endotracheal tube to 8.2 kPa (95% CI 7.0-9.4) with double-lumen ventilation. This corresponds to a reduction in carbon dioxide levels by 25%. At 6 ml/kg, pH increased from 7.17 (95% CI 7.09-7.24) with a standard endotracheal tube to 7.27 (95% CI 7.21-7.32) with double-lumen ventilation. Tracheal pressure was monitored continuously and no difference between single- or double-lumen ventilation was noted at corresponding levels of ventilation. There was no formation of auto-PEEP.

Allometric equations relating C. drummondii foliage and wood biomass to basal stem diameter were developed to estimate aboveground biomass and net primary productivity (ANPP) of C. drummondii. Within C. drummondii islands, ANPP was 496 ± 45 g C·m-2·year -1, nearly three times that within open grassland (167 ± 13 g C·m-2·year-1).

The reduced absorption and emission spectra of the CT complexes formed between hexamethylbenzene, pentamethylbenzene, and durene donors and 1,2,4,5-tetracyanobenzene (TCNB) in 1,2-dichloroethane (DCLE) exhibit a mirror image relationship, suggesting that each set of spectra describes transitions between the same two states. It was concluded that a CRIP is produced immediately upon excitation of the CT complex and that relaxation of the CRIP includes only minor geometry changes and changes in solvent polarization. In contrast to these results, the reduced absorption and emission spectra of the mesitylene (MES)/TCNB CT complex in DCLE are distinctly different and do not display a mirror image relationship. Time-resolved emission decay traces reveal the presence of an initial intermediate species that contributes approximately 10% of the total steady-state emission. The emission spectrum of this initial species mirrors the absorption spectrum of the MES/TCNB complex. In the MES/TCNB complex, excitation does not lead directly to the CRIP, and the relaxation of the excited complex must include an electronic component in addition to changes in geometry and solvation.

Through evolution many tree species have developed different ecotypes, which are closely adapted to the local climatic conditions. In order to elucidate the physiological basis of climatic adaptation involved in LT sensing in the northern tree species, we investigated responses of the northern and southern ecotypes of silver birch (Betula pendula Roth) to a range of decreasing temperatures. Development of freezing tolerance, determined by the electrolyte leakage, and bud dormancy release were monitored. A range of decreasing temperatures triggered cold acclimation and development of freezing tolerance in actively growing plants, and enhanced freezing tolerance and released bud dormancy in the dormant plants in both ecotypes tested. However, there were significant ecotypic differences in LT-induced cold acclimation and bud dormancy release. The northern ecotype was more responsive to a range of decreasing temperatures than the southern ecotype, resulting in more rapid cold acclimation and development of freezing tolerance in actively growing plants, and earlier enhancement of freezing tolerance and bud dormancy release in the dormant plants. Development of freezing tolerance and dormancy release induced by LT was accompanied by changes in ABA levels. Alterations in ABA levels paralleled with development of freezing tolerance and preceded bud dormancy release in both ecotypes tested, but these alterations in ABA levels were ecotype-dependent, the northern ecotype reacting more strongly to LT. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The major modifications focused on simulations of anaerobic biogeochemistry and rice growth as well as parameterization of paddy rice management. The new model was tested for its sensitivities to management alternatives and variations in natural conditions including weather and soil properties. The test results indicated that (1) varying management practices could substantially affect carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), or nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from rice paddies; (2) soil properties affected the impacts of management alternatives on GHG emissions; and (3) the most sensitive management practices or soil factors varied for different GHGs. For estimating GHG emissions under certain management conditions at regional scale, the spatial heterogeneity of soil properties (e.g., texture, SOC content, pH) are the major source of uncertainty. An approach, the most sensitive factor (MSF) method, was developed for DNDC to bring the uncertainty under control. According to the approach, DNDC was run twice for each grid cell with the maximum and minimum values of the most sensitive soil factors commonly observed in the grid cell. The simulated two fluxes formed a range, which was wide enough to include the ""real"" flux from the grid cell with a high probability. This approach was verified against a traditional statistical approach, the Monte Carlo analysis, for three selected counties or provinces in China, Thailand, and United States. Comparison between the results from the two methods indicated that 61-99% of the Monte Carlo-produced GHG fluxes were located within the MSA-produced flux ranges. The result implies that the MSF method is feasible and reliable to quantify the uncertainties produced in the upscaling processes. Equipped with the MSF method, DNDC modeled emissions of CO2, CH4, and N2O from all of the rice paddies in China with two different water management practices, i.e., continuous flooding and midseason drainage, which were the dominant practices before 1980 and in 2000, respectively. The modeled results indicated that total CH4 flux from the simulated 30 million ha of Chinese rice fields ranged from 6.4 to 12.0 Tg CH4-C per year under the continuous flooding conditions. With the midseason drainage scenario, the national CH4 flux from rice agriculture reduced to 1.7-7.9 Tg CH4-C. It implied that the water management change in China reduced CH4 fluxes by 4.2-4.7 Tg CH4-C per year. Shifting the water management from continuous flooding to midseason drainage increased N2O fluxes by 0.13-0.20 Tg N2O-N/yr, although CO2 fluxes were only slightly altered. Since N2O possesses a radiative forcing more than 10 times higher than CH4, the increase in N2O offset about 65% of the benefit gained by the decrease in CH4 emissions.

The H5FeW12O40/silica fabric is able to catalyze Orange II bleaching only under light irradiation. In the dark, long-lived intermediates produced in solution were observed to preclude further degradation. The most efficient polytungstate was selected based on the performance during Orange II photobleaching in the presence of H2O2. The H5FeW12O 40/silica fabric needed ∼60min to photobleach 85% of an Orange II (0.2mM) solution. The amount of H2O2 and the pH was optimized for the photobleaching of Orange II on the H5FeW 12O40/silica fabric. The photobleaching was more efficient as the intensity of the applied light was increased. Repetitive photobleaching cycles of Orange II (0.2mM) on the H5FeW12O 40/silica-structured fabric proceeded with the same kinetics, showing the stability of this fabric against oxidative radical attack and the absence of Fe-ions leaching into the solution during Orange II discoloration. The photobleaching times were similar for different concentrations of Orange II suggesting that it is controlled by mass transfer and not by a diffusion-controlled processes. The loading of the silica fabric was determined by elemental analysis to be 7.1% for Fe and 27.2% for W. By electron diffuse spectrometry W-clusters were identified on the silica fabrics and by high-resolution electron microscopy the W-clusters of the catalyst were observed to have sizes between 1 and 2nm. By X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, it is observed that the W-oxidation state is higher for the unused catalysts than in the catalyst after Orange II photobleaching. This lends support to a photo-assisted Fenton-like mechanism taking place in the H5FeW 12O40/ silica-structured fabrics during Orange II decomposition. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The task of controlling and improving air quality has attracted a great deal of national attention. The Taiwanese government has since set up the National Air Quality Monitoring Network (TAQMN) to monitor nationwide air quality and adopted an array of measures to combat this problem. This study applies data mining to uncover the hidden knowledge of air pollution distribution in the voluminous data retrieved from monitoring stations in TAQMN. The mining process consists of data acquisition from Web sites of 71 data gathering stations nationwide, data pre-processing using multi-scale wavelet transforms, data pattern identification using cluster analysis, and final analysis in mapping the identified clusters to geographical locations. The application of multi-scale wavelet transforms contributes greatly in removing noises and identifying the trend of data. In addition, the proposed two-level self-organization map neural network demonstrates its ability in identifying clusters on the high-dimensional wavelet-transformed space. The identified distribution of suspended particulate PM10 represents a complete, national picture of the present air quality situation, which contrasts the present pollution districts, and could serve as an important reference for government agencies in evaluating present and devising future air pollution policies. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The dependence of surface bonding on adsorbate coverage is also investigated. Adsorption energies and structural information are obtained and compared with existing experimental results for Ni(110) and Ni(111). In addition, activation barriers to CO dissociation have been determined on Ni(111) and Ni(531) by locating the transition states for these processes.

The rock is characterized by an assemblage of garnet, orthopyroxene, spinel, cordierite, biotite, plagioclase and quartz. Symplectites of orthopyroxene and spinel, and orthopyroxene and cordierite indicate the decompression under UHT conditions. Mineral chemistry shows that the orthopyroxenes have high XMg and Al2O3 contents (up to 9.23 wt%). Biotites are enriched in TiO2 and XMg, and they are stable under granulite facies conditions. The garnet and quartz from the rock carry monophase fluid inclusions which show peak melting temperatures of around -56.7°C, indicating a pure CO2 species being presented during the ultrahigh-T metamorphism in the Altay orogenic belt. The inclusions homogenize into a liquid phase at temperatures around 15.3-23.8°C translating into CO2 densities of the order of 0.86-0.88 g/cm3. Based on preliminary mineral paragenesis, reaction textures and petrogenetic grid considerations, we infer that the rock was subjected to UHT conditions. The CO2-rich fluids were trapped during exhumation along a clockwise P-T path following isothermal decompression under UHT conditions.","Altay orogenic belt; NW China; Petrology; Pure CO2 fluid inclusion; UHT granulite","Carbon dioxide; Garnets; Granular materials; Inclusions; Petrology; Altay orogenic belt; Central Asia; Fuyun region; Isothermal decompression; NW China; Orthopyroxene; Pure carbon dioxide fluid inclusion; Ultrahigh T spinel garnet granulite; Metamorphic rocks; carbon dioxide; mineral; article; chemistry; China; particle size; sediment; soil; solution and solubility; Carbon Dioxide; China; Geologic Sediments; Minerals; Particle Size; Soil; Solutions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10944231265

At 200 MWe load, the furnace excess O2 remains stable. The different horizontal fuel biases are obtained by changing the tilt angle of all the Louvre enrichers' regulating blades. The tilt angles of the blades are 0, 15, 24, 32°; the result is that the enriching ratios of the fuel-rich primary air increase from 2.2 to 2.6 at No. 2 corner, and from 1.2 to 4.2 at No. 3 corner. The gas temperature increases in the burner region. The application of the horizontal bias combustion burners results in a reduction in NOx formation from 545.7 mg Nm-3 (O2=6%) to 287.9 mg Nm-3, and a substantial reduction in carbon in ash content from 5.24 to 2.48%.

The redshifts, the temporal breaks of the optical afterglow light curves and the X-ray afterglows of these GRBs have been well measured. The results show that: (i) the distribution of the intrinsic burst durations extend over only approximately one order of magnitude, suggesting that these bursts tend to have a similar burst duration; (ii) the gamma-ray fluence in the comoving frame (S γ) as a function of θ is roughly fitted by a broken power law with indices of -0.4 and -3.79 before and after a break at θ = 0.1 rad, respectively, while the X-ray fluxes decay with θ following a single power law with an index of -1.8; (iii) the relation between the ratio of Fx/Sγ and θ follows a turnover power law with indices of -3.2 and 2.9 before and after the break at θ = 0.1, respectively; and (iv) the temporal indices of X-ray afterglows are significantly anticorrelated with θ with a Spearman rank linear correlation coefficient of r = -0.84 and a probability of chance occurrence of p = 0.004. These results are consistent with the expectations of the beaming model.

We correlated the monthly rate of relative change in normalized differenced vegetation index (NDVI) from advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) data to the rate of change in atmospheric CO2 concentration during the natural vegetation growing season for evidence of a possible CO2 fertilization effect on vegetation development. The study addressed seasonal and annual patterns in spatially averaged NDVI for 3 different ecological regions in North America from 1982 to 1992. Correlations between CO2 and NDVI were calculated for 3 different lag conditions. Relatively high and positive correlation coefficients were found when the monthly rate of change in NDVI was 1 mo lagged to that for CO2, which suggests, but does not prove, a CO2 fertilization effect on natural vegetation development. Generally, the correlation coefficients changed from relatively high and positive correlations when NDVI was lagged 1 mo behind CO2 to relatively high and negative correlations when CO2 was lagged 1 mo behind NDVI. A general increase in the annual maximum greenness of the vegetation was also found in most of the regions studied from 1982 to 2001. The desert and humid temperate regions in the eastern part of North America showed an increase in the annual minimum vegetation greenness, while the southern humid temperate regions showed relatively high correlations between the minimum NDVI and atmospheric CO2 concentration in interannual comparisons. The results of this study are generally consistent with the notion of a contemporary CO2 fertilization effect, but they also demonstrate how remotely-sensed data can be used to explore the effects of global change at large scales in order to complement experimental results obtained on smaller temporal and spatial scales. © Inter-Research 2004.","Climate change; CO2 fertilization effect; Global change; NDVI; Remote sensing; Vegetation","atmospheric gas; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; global change; growth rate; NDVI; remote sensing; North America; Western Hemisphere; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13844266059

The numerical analysis method was used to simulate the flow field structure of shock waves and to proceed with related experiment. In the experiment, a pulsed Nd-YAG laser was used as the heat source on a carbon steel target within the nozzle, and carbon steel particles were ejected by high pressure air. The solidification problem of carbon steel particles with radii of 1-50 μm in the compressible flow field was calculated and compared with experimental results. The result shows that the shock wave flow fields are generated at different entrance pressures (3-7 bar), and there is no significant difference in the radii of carbon steel particles produced by a fixed laser energy; however, in the flow field without the shock wave effect, the cooling effect is less evident in the solidification process.",,"Carbon steel; Concentration (process); High pressure effects; Laser beam effects; Mathematical models; Shock waves; Solid state lasers; Solidification; Specific heat; Thermal effects; Viscosity; Laser supersonic heating; Melting point; Operation pressure; Solid fraction; High energy physics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342435216

The active site for the latter reaction, called the A-cluster, consists of an Fe4S 4 cubane bridged to the proximal Ni site (Nip), which is bridged in turn to the so-called distal Ni site. In this review, evidence is presented that Nip achieves a zerovalent state at low potentials and during catalysis. Nip appears to be the metal to which CO and methyl groups bind and then react to form an acetyl-Nip intermediate. Methyl group binding requires reductive activation, where two electrons reduce some site on the A-cluster. The coordination environment of the distal Ni suggests that it could not be stabilized in redox states lower than 2+. The rate at which the [Fe4S4]2+ cubane is reduced is far slower than that at which reductive activation occurs, suggesting that the cubane is not the site of reduction. An intriguing possibility is that Nip 2+ might be reduced to the zero-valent state. Reinforcing this idea are Ni-organometallic complexes in which the Ni exhibits analogous reactivity properties when reduced to the zero-valent state. A zero-valent Ni stabilized exclusively with biological ligands would be remarkable and unprecedented in biology.","Carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; Nickel(0); Zero-valent nickel","acetyl coenzyme A synthetase; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; carbon monoxide dehydrogenase; nickel complex; catalysis; electron spin resonance; enzyme active site; enzyme mechanism; Escherichia coli; nonhuman; oxidation reduction state; priority journal; reaction analysis; review; Escherichia coli",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3943065808

Strategic documents from The Cities for Climate Protection Campaign (CCPC) are analysed to show how CCPC has constructed climate change protection as a local issue. The paper's premise is that the climate change issue must be translated or framed to enable actors to work with this problem in a local context, and that successful framing requires establishing a coherent method of describing social reality. CCPC emphasises that the different elements of local and global sustainable development agendas can be mutually reinforcing, and that climate change protection can be reconciled with local priorities and initiatives that reduce greenhouse gases (GHG). It is argued that this framing of climate change makes it difficult to see why and how climate change should be an important concern for local communities. The modest reductions of GHG in CCPC cities thus far highlights that finding meaningful new ways of linking the global and the local should be a core concern of CCPC. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,"climate change; emission control; environmental policy; local planning; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143145193

Sputter-deposited Mg films were also studied with mechanically polished samples used to monitor the overall corrosion process. The exposures were performed at 22.0 °C in a synthetic environment with precise control of relative humidity (95%) and CO2 (0 or 350 ppm). Corrosion is localized in the absence of CO2 and is related to noble inclusions in the metal matrix. After corrosion product removal, relatively deep pits are evident. In contrast, pitting is inhibited in the presence of CO2 with relatively uniform corrosion product development; further, the noble inclusions have no effect on the distribution of corrosion. The inhibitive effect of CO2 is also observed in the long-term exposures, showing that CO2 reduces the average corrosion rate. Mechanisms are introduced to explain the effects of CO2 and the roles of the noble inclusions on the corrosion behaviour. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The CO2 volume fraction required to extinguish the flames was determined for a range of added catalytic inhibitor volume fractions. When added at low volume fraction, the agents TMT, Fe(CO) 5, and MMT were effective at reducing the volume of CO2 required to extinguish the flames, with performance relative to CF3Br of 2, 4, and 8, respectively. This performance advantage of the metallic compounds is less than that determined in premixed or counterflow diffusion flames. Further, as the volume fraction of each metallic catalytic inhibitor was increased, the effectiveness diminished rapidly. The greatly reduced marginal effectiveness is believed to be caused by loss of active gas-phase species to condensed-phase particles. Laser-scattering measurements in flames with Fe(CO)5/CO2 blends detected particles both inside and outside (but not coincident with) the visible flame location for measurement points above the stabilization region. For Fe(CO)5 addition to the air stream at 450 μL/L, the peak scattering cross section for vertically polarized light was 1660 times the value for room-temperature air. The first detailed numerical modeling studies were also performed for methane-air cup-burner flames with CO2 and Fe(CO)5 added to the oxidizer stream and are used to interpret the experimental results. The role of particles was also illustrated by the numerical results, which showed that significant levels of supersaturation exist in the flame for several of the important iron-containing intermediates. This particle formation is favored in the lower temperature stabilization region of the cup-burner flames, as compared to the higher relevant temperatures of previously described counterflow diffusion flames. The results of this study indicate that the appropriate flame configuration for evaluating the effectiveness of some fire suppression agents must be carefully considered, since in those cases, different flame configurations can switch the relative performance of an agent by an order of magnitude. © 2004 The Combustion Institute.

A game theoretic model is generally a black box for decision makers, where the mechanisms, which lead to solution(s) of the game, are not explicitly pointed out. This paper opens this black box by making the (institutional) move rules explicit. The usual pessimistic outcome with an ineffective and small size of stable coalitions among world regions is countered. Our model challenges conventional wisdom in the sense that large coalitions are possible outcomes of the cartel game, namely by incorporating: (1) farsightedness, and (2) coalitional moves with commitment as an alternative to myopic and individual moves which characterise the cartel game. We show that even if the international negotiations on climate change mitigation are modelled as an n-person prisoner's dilemma, one cannot rule out cooperation among world regions as a solution of the game. Indeed, in most analysed situations the grand coalition is among the solutions of the game. This shows that predictions based on cartel stability may be too pessimistic if it comes to analysing incentives to cooperate in implementing international environmental policy. Moreover, in an empirically calibrated model, we find three out of six instances where Russia (with or without the US) has an incentive to sign the Kyoto protocol.","Climate change; Coalitional moves; Commitment; Farsightedness; International negotiations; Theory of social situations","climate change; environmental legislation; environmental policy; game theory; international agreement",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13744258188

This paper describes the existing state of engine control and on-board health management, and surveys some specific technologies under development that will enable an aircraft propulsion system to operate in an intelligent way - defined as self-diagnostic, self-prognostic, self-optimizing, and mission adaptable. These technologies offer the potential for creating extremely safe, highly reliable systems. The technologies will help to enable a level of performance that far exceeds that of today's propulsion systems in terms of reduction of harmful emissions, maximization of fuel efficiency, and minimization of noise, while improving system affordability, and safety. Technologies that are discussed include various aspects of propulsion control, diagnostics, prognostics, and their integration. The paper focuses on the improvements that can be achieved through innovative software and algorithms. It concentrates on those areas that do not require significant advances in sensors and actuators to make them achievable, while acknowledging the additional benefit that can be realized when those technologies becomea vailable.

Dodecane and hexadecane were used individually as surrogates for diesel fuels to simply the reaction study and the interpretation of the test results. The reforming of these hydrocarbon fuels was examined at a variety of oxygen-to-carbon and steam-to-carbon ratios at gas hourly space velocities ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 h-1. At steady state, the product composition correlated well with that calculated from thermodynamic equilibrium at a representative equivalent temperature. The oxygen-to-carbon ratio was determined to be the most significant operating parameter that influenced the reforming efficiency; the reforming efficiency (and the selectivity to COx) increased with increasing oxygen-to-carbon ratio up to about 0.42, at which value the maximum efficiency was attained. © 2003 International Association for Hydrogen Energy.

N2O is the major reduction product of the inverted (NO) 2 dimer, in accord with experiment.

Thus, an interdisciplinary approach has been transposed to the Norwegian mountains, combining socio-geographical, landscape ecological and adjusted dendroecological methods. Preliminary results presented for the continental Norwegian mountain region Vågå, Oppland, prove the treeline to be in a regeneration stage after a period of major human forced depression.

S. timber and pulp supplies are delivered from a wide range of companies, and come variously from publicly-owned forests, from company-owned lands, and from small private holdings where standing timber can be purchased and removed. Corporate strategies for environmental management of these resources and the facilities for manufacturing paper products need to be responsive to the public's interest in long-term effects of their operations. A successful strategy depends on many factors, including the industry's planning and management, the intensity of removals (clearfelling or selection logging), control of liquid and air emissions at the plant, and the thoroughness of replanting and related nutrient conservation measures on timberlands. Data on the efficacy of these industrial forest operations, at least for publicly-traded companies, can be discerned from annual shareholder and environmental reports. This study combines seven measures of environmental management strategies for the 10 forest and paper companies in the Standard and Poor's 500. The criteria for ranking each measure required that distinctions be made among field harvest and renewal practices as well as mill operations. The hypothesis being tested states that practices conducive to sustainability of productive capacity (i.e., maintaining equity in productive capacity across generations) also serve the self interest and enhancement of a company's shareholder value. While some variability is present, the results show the hypothesis holds. Total shareholder return for companies with advanced environmental management strategies is about 60 per cent higher than for the companies with low rankings. © 2004 NetLogex, LLC All rights reserved.",,"Corporate strategies; Environmental management; Financial returns; Timberlands; Finance; Forestry; Harvesting; Management; Manufacture; Paper; Planning; Productivity; Sustainable development; Timber; Environmental protection; environmental management; forest management; pulp and paper industry; timber industry; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243139533

In a sodium oxalate solution, two irreversible oxidation waves as well as two ECL emission waves were observed during the potential scan in the range 0.4-1.4 V (versus Ag/AgCl/saturated KCl reference). The first ECL wave appeared at ca. 0.8 V, which was caused by the excited-state Ru 2+* generated through a bimolecular redox reaction between electrogenerated Ru 3+ and the strong reducing agent, CO2-. The latter was formed via a Ru 3+-mediated oxidation of oxalate. Direct oxidation of oxalate was not involved in the first ECL process. The second ECL wave started at ca. 1.1 V, which was also from the excited-state Ru 2+* generated via the redox reaction between Ru 3+ and CO2-.

The soil microbiota, the decomposers of organic matter, is the second player carrying out carbon cycling. Numerous efforts have been made to quantify rhizodeposition and soil respiration to understand and predict the carbon cycling between the soil and atmosphere. However, there have been few attempts to link directly the soil microbial community to plant photosynthesis. We carried out a pulse-chase labeling experiment in a wetland rice system in which rice plants of various ages were labeled with 13CO2 for 6 h and the distribution of the assimilated 13C to soil microorganisms was estimated by analyzing the 13C profile of microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs). The results showed that total PLFA increased with plant growth, indicating an increase of microbial biomass. But the mono-unsaturated PLFAs increased faster than the branched chain fatty acids. The 13C was incorporated into PLFAs immediately after the plant 13CO2 assimilation, proving the tight coupling of microbial activity to plant photosynthesis. In line with the finding of seasonal change in total PLFAs, more of 13C was distributed to the straight chain fatty acids (16:0, 16:1ω7, 18:1ω7 and 18:1ω9) than to the branched chain fatty acids. The total plant carbon incorporation estimated from 13C labeling roughly corresponded to the increase in total PLFAs over the growing season of plants. Our study suggests that microbial populations in rice soil differ greatly in their responses to plant photosynthate input. © 2004 Federation of European Microbiological Societies.

The behaviour of the mean temperature is not necessarily related to the one of the extreme values. It means that a small increase of the mean might have no influence on increasing the extreme values. To detect climate change one must identify the climate change signal that one wishes to detect, estimate the statistical properties of the natural climatic variability and then determine an optimal method for detecting the trends and drifts in climatological time series. Extreme value techniques are important in climatological applications. Climate impacts are likely to be determined by extreme events. The complex stochastic structure of climatological time series induces the application of extreme value modelling. The aim of this paper is to analyse whether the extreme values of time series can detect charges, which reflects the supposition of ""global warming"" during the target 125 years (1876-2000) in Geofísico Institute station. Lisbon - Portugal. Because the urban area around the site expanded in the last century, urban heat advection trends contaminate the long-term trend during the night temperature series of ""Geofísico"". The analyses suggest that this effect may have raised the annual absolute temperatures regarding cold nights by 1.9°C and cold days by 2.7°C during the 20th century, which probably corresponds to an increase of the mean temperature. For the long-term precipitation series, no trend pattern could be detected. In conclusion, annual air temperatures below 0.3°C and above 38.5°C, as well as monthly cumulate precipitation above 275mm and annual cumulate precipitation above 990mm can be classified as rare events for Lisbon in the Geofísico Institute station.","Climatology; Extreme values distribution; Return level; Stationarity; Threshold","climate change; climatology; extreme event; global warming; measurement method; weather station",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542714959

Carbonate precipitation often induces the formation of massive crusts at the sediment surface or within surface sediments. The range of physical and biogeochemical conditions allowing for the formation of carbonate crusts is largely unknown so that the significance of these widespread manifestations of fluid flow is unclear. Here, we use numerical modeling to investigate the conditions that induce carbonate crust formation in the sediment and the effect of crust formation on sediment porosity and fluid flow rate. Starting with the conditions prevailing at a previously investigated reference site located on Hydrate Ridge, off Oregon, several parameters are systematically varied in a number of numerical experiments. These parameters include coefficients of bioturbation and bioirrigation, sedimentation rate, fluid flow velocity, methane concentration in the ascending vent fluids, and pH and saturation state at the sediment-water interface. The simulations show that carbonate crusts in the sediments only form if the fluids contain sufficient dissolved methane (&gt;50 mM) and if bioturbation coefficients are low (&lt;0.05 cm2 a-1). Moreover, high sedimentation rates (&gt;50 cm ka-1) inhibit crust formation. Bioirrigation induces a downward displacement of the precipitation zone and accelerates the formation of a solid crust. Crusts only form over a rather narrow range of upward fluid flow velocities (20-60 cm a-1), which is somewhat enlarged (up to 90 cm a-1) if the overlying bottom waters are supersaturated with respect to calcite. At higher flow rates, methane is rapidly exported into the water column so that methane oxidation and carbonate precipitation cannot proceed within the surface sediment. The formation of a several centimeters thick carbonate crust in surface sediments is typically completed after a few hundred years (100-500 a). Crust formation reduces the supply of methane to surface sediments which imposes a strong resistance against diffusive and advective methane transport. Therefore, rates of anaerobic methane oxidation and sulfide production are diminished and thus the density and metabolism of chemosynthetic biological communities is limited by crust formation.

The nature of such variations may depend upon the soil type, which in turn, is closely linked to local or regional topography. This study characterizes the soil and describes the status of carbon and nitrogen in vegetation, litterfall, litterlayer and soil upper layers along the main positions of a topographic gradient (plateau, slope and valley), 60 km north of Manaus, on Cuieiras Reserve watershed. Nitrogen concentrations in living leaves, fresh litterfall, litter-layer and soil upper layers were lower in the valley than in both slope and plateau plots. Carbon concentrations in plant material were not significantly different among the three topographic positions, resulting in higher C:N ratios in valley plots. Local topography (plateau, slope and valley) clearly was an influential factor in the nutrient distribution along the study locations. Lower rates of N cycling processes in the valley are probably related to its sandy soil texture and seasonal flooding. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","C : N ratio; Litter decomposition; Nitrogen dynamics; Soil texture; Topographic gradient","litterfall; nutrient cycling; soil organic matter; soil texture; topographic effect; tropical forest; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil; Manaus; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642548308

The experiments have been performed by either using the furnace only or the furnace together with a water heat store. Comparisons between these two operation strategies have been made concerning emissions and overall performance. Furthermore, the plant has been run to match a simulated heat demand during different seasons, in order to study the performance of the system during more realistic operation conditions. The results are very satisfactory concerning both performance and emissions, using any of the control strategies. Typical emissions of CO and NOx during the experiments are in the range of 10-50 mg Nm-3 (5-25 mg MJ -1) and 130-175 mg Nm-3 (60-90 mg MJ-1), respectively. However, during summer when the heat demand is low or zero, operational problems will occur if the heat store is excluded. Therefore, the main conclusion is that the most appropriate solution for a small district-heating system is to use a water heat store to match the heat load variations, while the furnace operates at as constant thermal output as possible. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This gas contains about 50% of methane, therefore it cannot be released into the atmosphere as it is because of its greenhouse effect consequences. The high percentage of methane encouraged researchers to find solutions to recover the related energy content for electric energy production. The most common technologies used at the present time are internal combustion reciprocating engines and gas turbines. High conversion efficiency guaranteed by fuel cells (FCs) enable to enhance the energy recovery process and to reduce emissions to air, such as NOx and CO. In any case, in order to investigate the environmental advantages associated with the electric energy generation using fuel cells, it is imperative to consider the whole ""life cycle"" of the system, ""from cradle-to-grave"". In fact, fuel cells are considered to be zero-emission devices, but, for example, emissions associated with their manufacture or for hydrogen production must be considered in order to evaluate all impacts on the environment. In the present work a molten carbonate fuel cell (MCFC) system for LFG recovery is considered and a life cycle assessment (LCA) is conducted for an evaluation of environmental consequences and to provide a guide for further environmental impact reduction. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

This controversy translates into great uncertainty in predicting future global terrestrial C sequestration. We propose a new framework that centers on the concept of progressive N limitation (PNL) for studying the interactions between C and N in terrestrial ecosystems. In PNL, available soil N becomes increasingly limiting as C and N are sequestered in long-lived plant biomass and soil organic matter. Our analysis focuses on the role of PNL in regulating ecosystem responses to rising atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, but the concept applies to any perturbation that initially causes C and N to accumulate in organic forms. This article examines conditions under which PNL may or may not constrain net primary production and C sequestration in terrestrial ecosystems. While the PNL-centered framework has the potential to explain diverse experimental results and to help researchers integrate models and data, direct tests of the PNL hypothesis remain a great challenge to the research community.","Biogeochemical cycles; Carbon sequestration; Climate change; Ecosystem productivity; Nutrient limitation",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043154067

The latter presents an extended tail generated by the interaction of the Lower Hybrid wave with the plasma as compared to the Maxwellian distribution function. For this purpose a new code has been developed which calculates for an arbitrary distribution function the intensity of radiation arriving at the plasma edge, the emission profile (as a function of position) and the optical depth (as a function of frequency) using the full dielectric tensor for a magnetized plasma. The electron distribution function is obtained by solving the Fokker-Planck equation in the frame of the quasilinear theory using a slab model. Results obtained for TCABR-like parameters show changes in the emission localized at positions where electron distribution function has been modified by the waves. Main parameter governing the changes in the electron cyclotron emission is the wave power. Changes in the plasma temperature and density profiles do not alter the emission profiles substantially. Reconstructed electron temperature profile has been obtained from the code radiation emission simulation, showing good agreement with the imposed temperature profile. The present results also showed that the changes in the emission profile in the region where the Lower Hybrid wave deposes its energy as compared with the emission profile of the plasma with Maxwellian distribution function are not so strong.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12744254282

Breath-by-breath influences on heart rate are also deficient.

Increased signals emerged in control (n = 14) over CCHS (n = 13; ventilator dependent during sleep but not waking) subjects in the cingulate and right parietal cortex, cerebellar cortex and fastigial nucleus, and basal ganglia, whereas anterior cerebellar cortical sites and deep nuclei, dorsal midbrain, and dorsal pons showed increased signals in the patient group. The dorsal and ventral medulla showed delayed responses in CCHS patients. Primary motor and sensory areas bordering the central sulcus showed comparable responses in both groups. The delayed responses in medullary sensory and output regions and the aberrant reactions in cerebellar and pontine sensorimotor coordination areas suggest that rapid cardiorespiratory integration deficits in CCHS may stem from defects in these sites.

From the multispin ISn REDOR experiments several dipolar couplings were determined and converted into distance constraints. Intra- and intermolecular dipolar couplings were distinguished by isotope dilution. The configuration of the MCU molecule can be determined from three torsion angles ψ1, ψ2, and ψ3. Ab initio calculations showed that these angles are either 0° or 180° (Z or E). From the REDOR experiments, the E configuration was found for ψ1 and ψ2 and the Z configuration for ψ3. Thus the configuration of MCU in the solid state was determined to be EEZ. Distance constraints for the intermolecular arrangement of MCU were obtained by performing REDOR experiments on 13C 15N2 MCU with different degrees of isotope dilution and on a cocrystallized 1:1 mixture of 13C(urea) MCU and 15N(amide) MCU. By combining these distance constraints with molecular modeling, three different possible packing motifs for MCU molecules were found. The molecules in these motifs are arranged as linear chains with methoxy groups at the borders of the chains.

These concentrations can, in turn, be used to estimate organism exposures and ultimately internal tissue concentrations that can be compared to mode-of-action-based critical body residues that induce toxic effects. From this comparison, risks to the exposed organism can be evaluated. To demonstrate the use of fate models in ecological risk assessment, we combine the EQuilibrium Criterion (EQC) environmental fate model with a simple screening level biouptake model for three representative organisms: a bird, a mammal, and a fish. This effort yields estimates of internal body concentrations that can be compared with levels known to elicit toxic effects. As an illustration, we present an analysis of 24 hydrocarbon components of gasoline that differ in properties but are assumed to elicit toxicity by a common narcotic mode of action. Results demonstrate that differences in chemical properties and mode of entry into the environment lead to profound differences in the efficiency of transport from emission to target biota. We discuss the implications of these results and draw attention to the insights gained about regional fate and ecological risks associated with gasoline. This approach is suitable for assessing single chemicals or mixtures that have similar modes of action. We conclude that the model-based methodologies presented are widely applicable for screening level ecological risk assessments that support effective chemicals management.",,"Chemicals; Hydrocarbons; Impurities; Mathematical models; Mixtures; Sediments; Soils; Toxicity; Transport properties; Biota; Birds; Mammals; Mass balance; Ecology; gasoline; hydrocarbon; bioaccumulation; hydrocarbon; mass balance; risk assessment; animal experiment; animal tissue; article; bioaccumulation; bird; chemical analysis; chronic toxicity; concentration (parameters); controlled study; degradation; ecotoxicology; fish; growth rate; half life time; mammal; nonhuman; partition coefficient; physical chemistry; risk assessment; sediment; transport kinetics; Animals; Biodiversity; Birds; Ecology; Environmental Exposure; Environmental Pollutants; Fishes; Gasoline; Geologic Sediments; Hydrocarbons; Models, Biological; Narcotics; Risk Assessment; Time Factors; Animalia; Aves; cellular organisms; Mammalia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9644265432

Our calculations show that electron transfer and bond dissociation take place as two distinct consecutive reaction steps. For the reduced complex, C-S bond fission and subsequent release of ethene can be observed directly at only slightly elevated temperatures. Car-Parrinello molecular dynamics of the reactive process demonstrate that for the dissociation to occur two carbon-sulfur bonds have to be broken quasi simultaneously. For the oxidized form on the other hand, no release of ethene takes place at the same temperature within the limited time scale of our simulations. The activation energies of the dissociation process calculated at the gradient-corrected density functional (BP) level are 21 and 10 kcal/mol for the oxidized and the reduced form, respectively.

Daily precipitation series from 22 evenly distributed Greek stations have been used for the period 1958-2000, along with the classification scheme of daily circulation types at 500 hPa for the same period. The seasonal frequency and the trends of circulation types have been calculated. It was found that there is a general positive trend of anticyclonic circulation types and a negative one for cyclonic types. The seasonal trends of rainy days and the precipitation totals have also been calculated and analysed. A general decreasing tendency of winter rainfall is observed; the decreasing trend during autumn and spring is less significant. Concerning the frequency and intensity of rainfall per circulation type, a decreasing tendency becomes evident for the majority of the stations during winter, whereas there is an increasing tendency during autumn. A multiple regression-cross-validation model was developed using the seasonal frequency of circulation types as predictors and the seasonal rainfall totals as predictants. Only the winter modelled precipitation shows a good agreement with the observed precipitation, whereas for the other seasons the agreement is relatively poor. This could be caused by the influence of different factors that are not captured by the classification scheme used. The proposed model could serve as a circulation-based downscaling method that could be further applied to geopotential data available from general circulation models in order to study regional climatological consequences of future climate scenarios.

Presently more than 70% of our country's energy requirement is met through import. Ethanol, one of the most widely used and renewable eco-friendly fuels can be used as a blend with gasoline to meet the growing demand of oil consumption. Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas decided to commission pilot projects in the sugar producing states to examine the techno-commercial feasibility of using it on a large scale. In addition, R&D studies with ethanol gasoline blends were also initiated on new generation passenger cars and 2 wheelers. Ethanol gasoline blends in passenger cars have shown satisfactory vehicle startability and driveability performance at temperatures of 50 C and 450 C with marginal increase in acceleration timings in only few cases. This indicates that ethanol can be blended upto 10% in gasoline without any engine modifications or any major adjustments. Also significant reduction in CO and HC emissions were achieved with only marginal increase of nitrogen oxides (NOx) is expected with use of ethanol blends. The field pilot projects conducted with 5% ethanol gasoline blends were successful and Government of India has now decided to mandate the use of 5% ethanol in gasoline in 9 States from the year 2003. In this paper, we have discussed the results of the R&D programme of ethanol-gasoline blends with respect to startability, driveability and emission performance of two wheelers and passenger cars. The paper also covers the experience during the pilot projects undertaken at 3 locations. The emission studies conducted on 2 wheelers with ethanol gasoline blends have indicated that vehicles fitted with catalytic converter can yield substantial benefit of emission reduction as both carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrocarbon (HC) will get reduced. © 2004 SAE International.",,"Automobiles; Carbon monoxide; Catalytic converters; Emission control; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Fossil fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Vehicle performance; Clean-burning fuel; Emission performance; Emission reduction; Energy requirements; Ethanol gasoline blend; Government of India; Oil consumption; Pilot projects; Gasoline",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84881206475

Such foils with their structure of randomly oriented nanocrystallites can best withstand ion irradiation damage. Accelerator users around the world are interested in this type of carbon stripper foils due to a guaranteed reproducibility, quality, thickness and uniformity given by the procedure. In addition a high reproducible yield with a low effort for floating, mounting and slackening is desired. Users of high-energy accelerators want to profit from this development, but need stripper foils of up to 500 μg/cm 2 for the relevant charge state equilibrium whereas carbon foils of this type could only be prepared with an upper limit of 10 μg/cm2 in the existing set up. The new design was aimed to overcome all thickness limitations. The crucial component of the laser plasma ablation technique is the laser entrance window which becomes opaque during carbon ablation. A new plant which overcomes this problem is being assembled. Due to a higher source-to-window distance and a better laser light transmission, caused by slightly changed laser plasma conditions, the life of the laser entrance window before exchange could be prolonged by a factor of five. Presumably, there are no thickness limitations anymore due to a vacuum interlock that permits the exchange of the entrance window without breaking the vacuum in the ablation-deposition chamber. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) were used to characterize the chemical states and crystal phases of transition metals on solid phases, respectively. CT was dechlorinated to chloroform (CF) by 3 mM Fe(II) in 10 mM goethite (25.6 m2 L-1) suspensions. The dechlorination followed pseudo-first-order kinetics, and a rate constant (k obs) of 0.036 h-1 was observed. Transition metal ions have different effects on CT dechlorination. The addition of Ni(II), Co(II), and Zn(II) lowered the kobs for CT dechlorination, whereas the amendment of 0.5 mM Cu(II) into the Fe(II)-Fe(III) system significantly enhanced the efficiency and the rate of CT dechlorination. The kobs for CT dechlorination with 0.5 mM Cu(II) was 1.175 h-1, which was 33 times greater than that without Cu(II). Also, the dechlorination of CT by surface-bound iron species is pH-dependent, and the rate constants increased from 0.008 h-1 at pH 4.0 to 1.175 h-1 at pH 7.0. When the solution contained Cu(II) and Fe(II) without goethite, a reddish-yellow precipitate was formed, and the concentration of Fe(II) decreased with the increase in Cu(II) concentration. XPS and XRPD analyses suggested the possible presence of Cu2O and ferrihydrite in the precipitate. Small amounts of aqueous Cu(I) were also detected, reflecting the fact that Cu(II) was reduced to Cu-(I) by Fe(II). A linear relationship between kobs for CT dechlorination and the concentration of Cu(II) was observed when the amended Cu(II) concentration was lower than 0.5 mM. Moreover, the kobs for CT dechlorination was dependent on the Fe(II) concentration in the 0.5 mM Cu(II)-amended goethite system and followed a Langmuir-Hinshelwood relationship. These results clearly indicate that Fe(II) serves as the bulk reductant to reduce both CT and Cu(II). The resulting Cu(I) can further act as a catalyst to enhance the dechlorination rate of chlorinated hydrocarbons in iron-reducing environments.",,"Catalysis; Copper; Dechlorination; pH effects; Precipitation (chemical); Rate constants; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; X ray powder diffraction; Crystal phases; Environmental engineering; carbon tetrachloride; chloroform; copper ion; ferric hydroxide; iron; metal ion; nickel; reducing agent; transition element; zinc; dechlorination; analytic method; article; catalyst; concentration (parameters); crystal; dechlorination; environment; enzyme kinetics; experiment; pH; reduction; solid; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; X ray powder diffraction; Adsorption; Carbon Tetrachloride; Copper; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Ions; Iron; Iron Compounds; Models, Theoretical; Oxidation-Reduction; Solvents; Kobus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347683490

Their argument was primarily based on the temperature data of olive growing areas in the world versus the climatic conditions in Texas. Actual growth and performance of olive trees was not tested at any location in Texas. However, approximately 5-6 years ago, interested farmers started a few olive groves on a trial basis at different locations in the Texas Valley. Normally, olive trees mature and then start flowering and fruiting within 4-6 years; early maturing cultivars can produce fruits within a year. A survey on the performance of these trees was, therefore, conducted during the 2002 and 2003 seasons to ascertain whether adaptability to local climatic conditions exists among clones of various olive cultivars planted at different locations. The survey identified clonal variation among two trees with striking adaptability to local climatic conditions thus producing flowers and fruits under conditions in which other olive cultivars did not flower. In addition, several trees were identified that produced remarkably well at different locations under climatic conditions that were marginally conducive to flowering. This information about the adaptability of some trees, exhibiting clonal variation, to the Valley climate offers hope that promising cultivars of olives could be developed for Texas by tapping into natural genetic diversity, clonal variation, and the adaptability of olive plant accessions to local climatic conditions. Additionally, there is a need to further evaluate the performance of selected trees and to import more cultivars from areas with climatic conditions similar to Texas for additional testing at different sites in Texas.",,"Embryophyta; Oleaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7544240878

Now, as the bitter disillusionment of the dot-com bust begins to fade, we have a chance to think again - this time more rationally - about how best to take advantage of the remarkable changes these new technologies are gradually making possible. One such change is the ability to create markets inside companies, allowing decision making to be decentralized and introducing some of the efficiency, flexibility, and motivating influence of free markets. In this article, the author examines this nascent form of business organization, exploring the benefits as well as the potential risks. BP, for example, met its goal of reducing the company's greenhouse gas emissions nine years ahead of schedule, not by setting and enforcing targets for each division but by allowing business unit heads to buy and sell emissions permits among themselves using an electronic trading system. And Hewlett-Packard recently experimented with a system that allowed employees to buy and sell predictions about likely printer sales, using a kind of futures contract. The markets ended up predicting the actual printer sales with much more accuracy than official HP forecasts. At a fundamental level, these changes are enabled by the fact that electronic technologies allow information to be widely shared at little cost. This simple fact has a profound implication for organizing businesses. When more people have more information, they can use it to make their own well-informed decisions, appropriate to local circumstances, instead of following orders from above. As a result, even very large companies can benefit from the collective wisdom of their employees.",,"commercial phenomena; decision support system; economics; hospital management; marketing; organization; organization and management; review; Commerce; Decision Making, Organizational; Decision Support Systems, Management; Efficiency, Organizational; Marketing; Organizational Objectives; Product Line Management",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842483407

Basic to such models is the idea that the accumulation of experience leads to a lowering of costs. This paper is intended to explore some of the algorithmic issues in LBD modeling for carbon dioxide abatement. When using a standard algorithm for nonlinear programming, there is no guarantee that a local LBD optimum will also be a global optimum. Fortunately, despite the absence of guarantees, there is a good chance that one of the standard algorithms will produce a global optimum for models of this type-particularly if there is an artful selection of the starting point or of the terminal conditions. Moreover, there is a new procedure named BARON. In the case of small models, a global optimum can be recognized and guaranteed through BARON. Eventually, it should be possible for BARON or a similar approach to be extended to large-scale LBD models for climate change. Meanwhile, in order to check for local optima, the most practical course may be to employ several different starting points and terminal conditions. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Our analysis of benefits of climate policy suggests, however, that researchers and policymakers should also take account of ancillary benefits, e.g., in the shape of improved air quality induced by climate protection measures. A consideration of both, primary and ancillary benefits, has a positive influence on global climate protection efforts, e.g., because the regional impact of ancillary effects attenuates easy-riding motives of countries with respect to their provision of climate protection. In this article, we analyze the nature of ancillary benefits, present an overview of European assessment studies and explain possible methods to estimate ancillary benefits. Main differences between primary and ancillary benefits are pointed out. Furthermore, we stress the major influences of ancillary benefits on climate policy. Finally, we present one of the first models integrating primary and ancillary benefits. By this model quantitative results are calculated with respect to ancillary benefits in the UK considering different greenhouse gas (GHG) control levels. It is observed that the ancillary benefits could cover about 4 percent of the full GHG reduction cost.","Ancillary benefits; Climate policy; Pollution control",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543034604

In southern Brazil, in a subtropical forest with no pronounced dry season (average annual precipitation = 1389 mm, minimum monthly average c. 75 mm), plant phenology was studied to test for patterns (periodicity), to examine how phenological patterns vary among life-forms, and to test whether phenological cycles are associated with climatic variables. Thirty-seven plant species in four life-forms (trees, shrubs, lianas and epiphytes) were studied for 2 yr (1996-98) in an Araucaria forest remnant in southern Brazil, in the state of Paran. Correlation and multiple regression methods established relationships between phenology and climate in terms of daylength, temperature and rainfall. In this Araucaria forest, plants showed seasonality in most life-forms and phenological phases. Leaf-fall, with its peak during the drier months (April to July), was the most seasonal. Flushing and flowering occurred during the wetter months (September to December), while fruiting occurred all year long. Phenologies varied among life-forms, and were strongly associated with daylength or temperature of preceding months, suggesting that plants receive their phenological cues well in advance of their phenological response. Phenologies in this Araucaria forest appear to be associated with the most predictable and highly correlated of the climatic variables, daylength and temperature and least so with rainfall, which is unpredictable.","Araucaria angustifolia; Atlantic Rain forest; Daylength; Epiphytes; Flowering; Flushing; Fruiting; Leaf-fall; Lianas; Life-forms; Phenology","day length; phenology; plant; temperature; tropical forest; Brazil; Parana; South America; Araucaria; Araucaria; Araucaria angustifolia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042720012

Based on these three findings, we propose that phytoplankton respiration can be estimated as twice the overnight loss of organic carbon.

The diagnosis from these space-based observations is highly consistent with current understanding of surface ozone chemistry based on in situ observations. The satellite-derived ratios indicate that surface ozone is more sensitive to emissions of NOx than of VOCs throughout most continental regions of the Northern Hemisphere during summer.

Steady-state model simulations were run to generate performance plots for various influent concentrations, loadings, residence times, media sizes, and temperatures. Although elimination capacity and removal efficiency frequently are used to characterize biofilter performance, effluent concentration can be used to characterize performance when treating to a target effluent concentration. Model simulations illustrate that, at a given temperature, a biofilter cannot reduce H2S emissions below a minimum value, no matter how large the biofilter or how long the residence time. However, a higher biofilter temperature results in lower effluent H2S concentrations. Because dynamic model simulations show that shock loading can significantly increase the effluent concentration above values predicted by the steady-state model simulations, it is recommended that, to consistently meet treatment objectives, dynamic feed conditions should be considered.

We argue that understanding of climate change in the region requires the knowledge of the mean circulation before its variability can be determined. Since estimates of long-term mean fluxes in the region are not available from observations, we present a modeling approach to quantify the climatological circulation and northward transports from the Norwegian Sea into the Arctic Ocean. A coupled ice-ocean model of the pan-Arctic region is configured at a 1/12° and 45-level grid and is integrated for 7 decades using a combination of daily-averaged 1979-2001 European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts data. Simulated water mass characteristics are compared with climatological atlas and selected observational data. The separation of the Norwegian Atlantic Current into Barents Sea and Fram Strait branches and their relative contributions to the total mass and property input into the Arctic Ocean are quantified. We emphasize the Barents Sea because fewer direct measurements of transports exist there and because water masses are significantly altered along this path by the seasonal ice melt/formation and the freshwater inputs. Under the given atmospheric forcing the Barents Sea outflow is shown to significantly contribute to the boundary flow continuing along the slopes of the Arctic Ocean. On the basis of model results, we argue that the contribution of the Barents Sea branch of Atlantic Water into the Arctic Ocean is equally, if not more, important than the Fram Strait branch.

They can generate, depending on their magnitude, a momentary embarrassment or a daily permanent stress, likely to condition the relations of the man with his entourage. The inhabitant of these cities and these spaces develops a whole arsenal of behaviours to adapt to it. They go from the simple embarrassment to social isolation. The daily practice of urban space is inevitably disturbed. The public streets and places are among the features in which the quality of environment and comfort have come to deterioration. This degradation is due mainly to a discontinuity in the use of these spaces: the hours of frequentation correspond to the freshest hours of the day, with the result that during the long summer period, which spreads out from May to October, the majority of these spaces witness a drastically reduced frequentation. This fact encourages us to try to better understand how urban external space is affected by the climate and especially how it acts on this one in return. In the majority of the cities of the hot climate areas, the dominating role and the importance of the places are characteristic of a way of life which is not limited inside the buildings. The intrinsic potentialities of these spaces transform them into places of relaxation, meeting and allow a great number of activities. In these hot climates, in order to fight against certain excessive situations, the recourse to natural means was essential through the centuries. The recent urban transformations, by inducing a generalised mineralisation of urban external spaces, often synonymous with summer overheating, make necessary the recourse to thermal regulation techniques. Moreover, these urban spaces are, in most cases, adjacent to occupied spaces like housing, administrative and commercial premises and may, therefore, add to their cooling load by transmitting excessive heat to the surrounding premises. That is why it seems necessary to understand the way they receive the solar radiation and the influence of geometry, orientation and other factors by means of calculating solar energy, ambient and mean radiant temperatures. The objective of this paper is to show that the thermal regulation of the urban microclimate, in hot and dry climate areas is possible by judicious choices of the orientation of the place, space form, size and provision and importance of the vegetable masses. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Experimental results demonstrated a high potential of DME for a boiler and a gas-turbine fuel. DME has a wide stable-combustion range compared with those of the other fuels. In this study, the concept of the low-NOx combustion, referred to as the tube-nested combustion, was applied to the DME combustion. This tube-nested combustor consists of tube banks to cool the burning flame leading to NOx reduction. Then, the NOx emission of the DME combustion was successfully reduced to a level suitable for practical applications.","Alternative fuel; Boiler; Diffusion combustion; DME (Dimethyl Ether); Gas turbine; NOx reduction; Tube-nested combustor","Combustors; Diffusion; Exhaust gases; Fuel burners; Gas turbines; Liquefied petroleum gas; Synthetic fuels; Gas-turbine fuels; Tube-nested combustion; Combustion; combustor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242664238

It is shown that Beijing has a large percentage increase in total energy demand, and will become the second largest energy consuming mega-city after Seoul in 2005. Due to less efficiency in electricity generation and heat supply and faster population growth, Beijing will be positioned above Seoul and Shanghai will be positioned above Tokyo in CO2 emission by 2020. Among the five scenarios for CO2 emission reduction, the comprehensive factor improvement scenario including all the measures has the highest CO2 reduction rate, and the fuel-type factor imporveemnt scenario has the lowest. In 2020, by improving the comprehensive factor, CO2 reduction amounts could reach 8.6 million tons in Beijing, 4.8 million tons in Shanghai, 4.6 million tons in Tokyo, and 4.4 tons in Seoul.","Asian mega-cities; CO2 emission; Energy demand model; Residential sector; Scenario approach","atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; residential energy; Asia; Beijing [China]; China; Eurasia; Far East; Honshu; Japan; Kanto; Korea; Seoul [South Korea]; Shanghai; South Korea; Tokyo [Kanto]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33745678771

Amazonia remained predominantly forested at the LGM, although the combination of reduced temperatures, precipitation and atmospheric CO 2 concentrations resulted in forests structurally and floristically quite different from those of today. Cold-adapted Andean taxa mixed with rainforest taxa in central areas, while dry forest species and lianas probably became important in the more seasonal southern Amazon forests and savannahs expanded at forest-savannah ecotones. Net primary productivity (NPP) and canopy density were significantly lower than today. Evergreen rainforest distribution and NPP increased during the glacial-Holocene transition owing to ameliorating climatic and CO2 conditions. However, reduced precipitation in the Early-Mid-Holocene (ca. 8000-3600 years ago) caused widespread, frequent fires in seasonal southern Amazonia, causing increased abundance of drought-tolerant dry forest taxa and savannahs in ecotonal areas. Rainforests expanded once more in the Late Holocene owing to increased precipitation caused by greater austral summer insolation, although some of this forest expansion (e.g. in parts of the Bolivian Beni) is clearly caused by palaeo Indian landscape modification. The plant communities that existed during the Early-Mid-Holocene may provide insights into the kinds of vegetation response expected from similar increases in temperature and aridity predicted for the twenty-first century. We infer that ecotonal areas near the margins of the Amazon Basin are liable to be most sensitive to future environmental change and should therefore be targeted with conservation strategies that allow 'natural' species movements and plant community re-assortments to occur.","Amazon tropical forest; Carbon dioxide; Holocene; Last glacial maximum; Palaeoclimate","carbon dioxide; climate change; Holocene; Last Glacial Maximum; paleobotany; paleoclimate; Amazonia; South America",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642389473

Incorrect parametrization of land-surface processes and prescription of the surface parameters in atmospheric modeling, can result in artificial changes of the horizontal gradient of the sensible heat flux. Thus, an error in horizontal temperature gradient within the lower atmosphere may be introduced. The reliability of the model depends on the quality of boundary layer scheme implemented and its sensitivity to the bare soil and vegetation parameters. In this study, a series of sensitivity experiments has been conducted over broad time scales, using a version of the ARPEGE Climate Model coupled to the ISBA land surface scheme in order to investigate model sensitivity to separate changes in land surface parameters over Africa. Effects of perturbing vegetation, cover, distribution of soil depth, albedo of vegetation, roughness length, leaf area index and minimum stomatal resistance were explored by using a simple statistical analysis. Identifying which parameters are important in controlling turbulent energy fluxes, temperature and soil moisture is dependent on which variables are used to determine sensibility, which type of vegetation and climate regime is being simulated and the magnitude and sign of the parameter change. This study does not argue that a particular parameter is important in ISBA, rather it shows that no general ranking of parameters is possible. So, it is essential to specify all land surface parameters with greater precision when attempting to determine the climate response to modification of the land surface. The implication of ISBA being sensitive to parameters that cannot be validated suggests that there will always be considerable doubt over the predictive quality of land-surface schemes. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"climate modeling; deforestation; general circulation model; land surface; parameterization; sensible heat flux; surface flux",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142609012

Combined effects of plausible land-cover change and greenhouse warming are assessed by 'time-slice' simulations with an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) for the middle of the twenty first century. Three ""time-slice"" integrations have been performed with the ARPEGE-Climat AGCM incorporating a zooming technique to achieve a resolution of about 100 km over Africa. A control run for the current climate is forced by observed climatological sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and the observed vegetation distribution is specified from a new vegetation database, in order to improve the geographical distribution and properties of the vegetation cover. Future SST changes are derived from a transient coupled atmosphere-ocean simulation for scenario B2 of the International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). Future vegetation changes are specified from a simulation of scenario B2 with the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment (IMAGE) developed at the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment in the Netherlands (RIVM). The results show that land surface processes can locally modulate greenhouse warming effects for African climate, with reductions of surface transpiration and small increases of surface temperature. Deforestation of tropical Africa has overall only a marginal effect on precipitation because of a compensatory increase in moisture convergence. Energy budget analyses show that increases in surface temperature are produced both by increases of greenhouse gases (GHG) concentration from the increase in downward atmospheric longwave radiation, and by African tropical deforestation from the resulting reduction in transpiration. This study indicates that realistic land-use changes, though of smaller amplitude than green-house gas forcing may have a small regional effect in projections of future climate. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"atmospheric general circulation model; climate change; global warming; greenhouse effect; land cover; land use change; vegetation cover; Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342417732

Objectives: To review the hospitalist literature to understand the hospitalist role, identify benefits and risks of the hospitalist model to family physicians, and discuss future opportunities to study and work with hospitalists. Methods: An integrative review of published literature about the hospitalist model focused on the influence of hospitalists on family practice. Results: Three main themes were identified as interest areas for family physicians: descriptions of the hospitalist role and responsibilities; hypothesized benefits and risks of the hospitalist model; and reported research results evaluating the effect of the hospitalist model. Two major opportunities related to hospitalists and family physicians were also uncovered: opportunities to conduct future research to study the influence of hospitalists on family physicians; and opportunities to create workable relationships with these new practitioners. Conclusions: Despite some opposition to hospitalist programs, the economic climate and increasing productivity standards suggest that these programs are here for the foreseeable future, and it is in family, physicians' best interests to understand the opportunities and risks of the hospitalist model.

Here, we use the available global record of climate-sensitive sediments, plants, and dinosaurs to infer broadscale geographic patterns for the Late Jurassic. These provide a context for our more detailed accounts of the Morrison and Tendaguru Formations in North America and East Africa. At the global scale, evaporites predominated in low latitudes and coals in mid- to high latitudes. We ascribe these variations to a transition from drier to wetter conditions between the equator and poles. Plant diversity was lowest in equatorial regions, increasing to a maximum in midlatitudes and then decreasing toward the poles. Most dinosaur remains are known from low-latitude to marginally midlatitude regions where plant fossils are generally sparse and evaporites common. Conversely, few dinosaur remains are known from mid- to high latitudes, which have higher floral diversities and abundant coals. Hence, there is an obvious geographic mismatch between known dinosaur distributions and their primary food source. This may be due to taphonomic bias, indicating that most dinosaur discoveries provide only a small window on the diversity and lifestyles of this group. On the basis of our global- and local-scale studies, we suggest that dinosaur preservation was favored in environments toward the drier end of the climate spectrum, where savannas rather than forests predominated. A holistic approach, incorporating climate and vegetation as well as geography, is required to better understand patterns of dinosaur ecology and evolution. © 2004 by The University of Chicago.

Fe concentration in the (Mg,Fe)(Si,Al)O inclusion is consistent with empirical relations relating FeΣFe to Al concentration, supporting the inference that it crystallised in the perovskite structure at lower mantle conditions. In ferropericlase there is a nearly linear variation of trivalent cation abundance with monovalent cation abundance, suggesting a substitution of the form Na0.5M0.53O (M=Fe3+, Cr3+, Al3+). Excess positive charge is likely balanced by cation vacancies, where their abundance is observed to increase with increasing iron concentration, consistent with high-pressure experiments. The abundance of cation vacancies is related to oxygen fugacity, where ferropericlase inclusions from Kankan and São Luiz (Brazil) are inferred to have formed at conditions more oxidising than Fe-(Mg,Fe)O equilibrium, but more reducing than Re-ReO equilibrium. Fe2+Mg partition coefficients between (Mg,Fe)(Si,Al)O3 and ferropericlase were calculated for inclusions co-existing in the same diamond using Mössbauer data and empirical relations based on high-pressure experimental work. Most values are consistent with high-pressure experiments, suggesting that these inclusions equilibrated at lower mantle conditions. The measured ferropericlase Fe3+ concentrations are consistent with diamond formation in a region of redox gradients, possibly arising from the subduction of oxidised material into reduced lower mantle. Reduction of carbonate to form ferropericlase and diamond is consistent with a slight shift of Kankan δ 13C values to isotopically heavy compositions compared to the worldwide dataset, and could supply the oxygen necessary to satisfy the high Fe3+ concentration in (Mg,Fe)(Si,Al)O3 perovskite, as well as account for the high proportion of ferropericlase in the lower mantle paragenesis. The heterogeneity of lower mantle diamond sources indicates that the composition of lower mantle diamonds do not necessarily reflect those of the bulk mantle. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Also, because grazing land is a common-pool resource, we determine the impact of cooperation on these decision variables. To capture different abilities of communities to cooperate in managing these externalities, we construct indices comprised of factors considered to affect the costliness of achieving successful cooperation. We then test hypotheses regarding the impact of rainfall variability and cooperation, using data collected in a semi-arid region of Niger. Results indicate that rainfall variability initially leads to higher densities, but the impact becomes negative as variability increases still further. This result indicates that the benefits of accumulating large herds in variable environments are eventually offset by the increasing probability of large losses. Mobility in the current period is strongly related to current rainfall, and is also positively related to long-term rainfall variability. Communities with characteristics hypothesised to favour cooperation have lower stock densities and greater herd mobility. Neither cooperation nor rainfall variability has a significant impact on the proportion of land allocated to crops or common pastures. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,"climate conditions; grazing; livestock farming; pastoralism; rainfall; stocking density; Africa; Niger [West Africa]; Sub-Saharan Africa; West Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242706222

For a comparison of forests in two contrasting climates we also evaluated trends in δ13CR from a wet 20-year-old Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) plantation located near the Pacific Ocean. Intraannual variability in δ13C R was greater than 8.0‰ at both sites, was highest during autumn, winter, and spring when rainfall was abundant, and lowest during summer drought. The δ13CR of the dry pine forest was consistently more positive than the wetter Douglas-fir forest (mean annual δ13CR: -25.41‰ vs. -26.23‰, respectively, P = 0.07). At the Douglas-fir forest, δ13CR-climate relationships were consistent with predictions based on stomatal regulation of carbon isotope discrimination (Δ). Soil water content (SWC) and vapor pressure deficit (vpd) were the most important factors governing δ13CR in this forest throughout the year. In contrast, δ13CR at the pine forest was relatively insensitive to SWC or vpd, and exhibited a smaller drought-related enrichment (∼2‰) than the enrichment observed during drought at the Douglas-fir forest (∼ 5‰). Groundwater access at the pine forest may buffer canopy-gas exchange from drought. Despite this potential buffering, δ 13CR at the pine forest was significantly but weakly related to canopy conductance (Gc), suggesting that δ13CR remains coupled to canopy-gas exchange despite groundwater access. During drought, δ 13CR was strongly correlated with soil temperature at both forests. The hypothesis that canopy-level physiology is a critical regulator of δ13CR was supported; however, belowground respiration may become more important during rain-free periods. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Carbon isotopes; Climate; Ecosystem respiration; Keeling plot; Pinus ponderosa; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Stomatal conductance","carbon isotope; respiration; seasonal variation; stomatal conductance; water availability; North America; Oregon; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Abies; Pinus ponderosa; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7244247249

These estimates assume that all CO2 efflux originates from respiration of local tissues and that all CO2 produced by local tissues escapes to the atmosphere through the bark. However, dissolved CO2 can be transported in the xylem stream, and CO2 concentration ([CO2]) in xylem can be up to three orders of magnitude greater than that of the atmosphere, suggesting that measurements of CO2 efflux do not account for all CO2 produced by respiration. Here, we propose a new mass balance approach for estimating the respiration rate of tree stems that accounts for both external and internal fluxes of CO2. We demonstrate this approach using measurements of CO2 efflux, sap flux and internal [CO2] to calculate the rate of CO2 production of a segment of stem tissue in situ. At different times of the day, CO2 produced by respiration of stem tissues followed different flux pathways. During daylight hours when sap was flowing, a large proportion of respired CO2 was carried away in the xylem stream, whereas at night, most respiratory CO 2 escaped to the atmosphere through the bark. Our calculations showed errors in efflux-based estimates of respiration of up to 76% compared with estimates that include both internal and external fluxes.","Fagus grandifolia; Henry's law; Liquidambar styraciflua; Microelectrode; Platanus occidentalis","carbon dioxide; carbon flux; mass balance; respiration; stem; Fagus; Fagus grandifolia; Liquidambar; Liquidambar styraciflua; Platanus occidentalis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9144234322

Examples are taken from modern-day and to subhumid settings and represent a geographical distribution ranging from Libya and Oman, to the Mediterranean, the Caribbean and Mexico. The results indicate that a palaeoclimatic signal can be identified in some deposits. However, in other sediments there is substantial variability in mean cement abundance within deposits as well as between these sand bodies. Moreover, many of the better cemented sediments are located in areas where there is accelerated diagenesis, such as in the sea spray zone, close to the groundwater table or near to a palaeosurface, rather than in climatically wet regions. The inference is that palaeoclimatic interpretations are substantially complicated by other factors that affect diagenetic processes and change. Therefore caution is needed when studying the role of climate in vadose diagenesis in the light of the effects of other intrinsic and extrinsic controls. This paper does not aim to provide a definitive comparison of sites from different climatic zones. The approach taken here is: (a) to see if there is an overall palaeoclimatic signal in the samples studied; (b) to use examples to illustrate how explanations/controls other than those relating to climate can account for the variabilities observed; and (c) if there is a climatic effect, to see if it is the main over-riding control on vadose diagenesis. The conclusions drawn from this research highlight that it is possible to misinterpret evidence if the study is approached with preconceived notions of simplistic relationships between diagenesis and climate.

The primary reactions controlling water chemistry were dedolomitization, cation exchange, feldspar weathering, and O2 reduction and denitrification. Radiocarbon ages adjusted for C mass transfers ranged from &lt;2.6 ka ( 14C) B.P. near the water table to 12.8±0.9 ka (14C) B.P. at the base of the aquifer, indicating the unconfined central High Plains aquifer contained a stratified sequence of ground water spanning Holocene time. A cross-sectional model of steady-state ground-water flow, calibrated using radiocarbon ages, is consistent with recharge rates ranging from 0.8 mm/a in areas overlain by loess to 8 mm/a in areas overlain by dune sand. Paleorecharge temperatures ranged from an average of 15.2±0.7°C for the most recently recharged waters to 11.6±0.4°C for the oldest waters. The temperature difference between Early and Late Holocene recharge was estimated to be 2.4±0.7°C, after taking into account variable recharge elevations. Nitrogen isotope data indicate NO3 in paleorecharge (average concentration=193 μM) was derived from a relatively uniform source such as soil N, whereas NO3 in recent recharge (average concentration=885 μM) contained N from varying proportions of fertilizer, manure, and soil N. Deep water samples contained components of N2 derived from atmospheric, denitrification, and deep natural gas sources. Denitrification rates in the aquifer were slow (5±2×10-3 μmol NL-1a-1), indicating this process would require &gt;10 ka to reduce the average NO3 concentration in recent recharge to the Holocene background concentration.",,"Radiocarbon ages; Recharge rates; Aquifers; Carbon; Groundwater; Isotopes; Positive ions; Sampling; Geochemistry; aquifer characterization; hydrogeochemistry; radiocarbon dating; recharge; Kansas; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444347893

Three scenarios are assessed: 1) providing access to cleaner fuels, (2) providing access to improved stoves, and (3) providing part of the population with access to cleaner fuels and part of the population with improved stoves. All intervention scenarios are compared with the current situation, i.e., the ""business as usual"" scenario where current exposures to indoor air pollution from solid fuel use would be sustained. Two major health outcomes associated with indoor air pollution are addressed, namely acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) in young children under five years of age and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in adults over twenty. While providing access to cleaner fuels has a larger health impact on the population than improved stoves, there are considerable health benefits associated with improved stove use. Improved stoves are also much more cost-effective than cleaner fuels. Of the cleaner fuels, kerosene, or paraffin, is more cost-effective than liquified petroleum gas (LPG), since kerosene is cheaper than LPG. Concerns about kerosene use, including poisoning, explosions, and possible carcinogenic effects, should be carefully considered before recommending its widespread use over LPG, however. This analysis offers further support for the argument that, from a public health point of view, there should be a continued emphasis on the promotion of improved stoves, as well as other locally appropriate means to reduce exposures within solid fuel-using households, until everyone can be given access to cleaner fuels. © 2004 International Energy Initiative, Inc.",,"Air pollution; Cost benefit analysis; Cost effectiveness; Cost reduction; Costs; Health; Heating; Indoor air pollution; Kerosene; Liquefied petroleum gas; Pollution; Pollution control; Pulmonary diseases; Stoves; Business-as-usual; Carcinogenic effects; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Cost effectiveness analysis; Current situation; Health benefits; Health outcomes; Lower respiratory infections; Fuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-33644776220

Makarova 2, 199034 St Petersburg, Russian Federation","A comprehensive study of the 2200-Ma-old Kuetsjärvi Sedimentary Formation (KSF), NW Russia, was undertaken to contribute to our understanding of palaeoenvironments associated with the global perturbation of the carbon cycle between 2330 and 2060 Ma. Closely spaced drill core samples (n=95) were obtained from a 150-m-thick unit deposited in rift-bound fluvial-deltaic and shallow-water lacustrine settings with a short-term invasion of sea water. Apart from a very few de-dolomitised samples, all other carbonate lithologies are represented by Corg-free, S-poor, quartz-rich dolostones, stromatolites and travertines which have high Sr concentrations (51–1069 ppm) and low Mn/Sr ratios (2·9 ± 2·1). The carbonate succession, excluding travertines, shows high δ13C (+7·5 ± 0·6‰, n=95) with a limited variation (+5·8 to +8·9‰). Fluctuating δ18O values (10·8–20·4‰) were overprinted during diagenesis, regional greenschist-grade and later retrograde metamorphism. Several short-term stratigraphic excursions of δ13C were apparently governed by evaporation and CO2 degassing combined with pulses of12C-rich hydrothermal waters precipitating travertines. However, the 13C-rich nature of the dolostones reflects the global isotopic signal, which was modified in a shallow water lacustrine environment by evaporation, enhanced uptake of 12C by cyanobacteria, and pene-contemporaneous oxidation and loss of organic material. The best proxies to δ13C and 87Sr/86 Sr of coeval sea water recorded in the KSF dolostones are likely to be around +5–6‰ and 0·70406, respectively. The study of the KSF has shown that circumspection is necessary when attempting to model the behaviour and evolution of the global C-cycle in Deep Time. Models which purport to explain global oceanic—atmospheric evolution without first adequately accounting for the possibility that many Precambrian carbonate deposits might be non-marine, or at least influenced by non-marine fluids, should be viewed with caution. © 2004, Royal Society of Edinburgh.

In this work we have analysed implanted TiN films by using secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS). Coatings with a thickness of about 4 μm were implanted with C+ at energies of 100 keV and fluences ranging from 1016 to 7 × 1017 ions/cm2. The experiments were performed on commercial TiN films prepared by physical vapour deposition (PVD) on hard metal tools. If reactive elements, like C or N, are implanted to significative fluences, the implant concentration (say greater than 1 at.%) could induce a distortion in the experimental elemental profiles because of a change in the sputtering yield and/or the ionisation probability (matrix effects). While the first point has been shown to be largely insignificant, the second is studied in more detail. In the case of carbon implanted in TiN the influence of matrix effects on the secondary ion signals can be minimised if a primary beam of Cs+ and secondary negative ions are chosen for depth profiling up to fluences of technological interest, say 3 × 1017 ions/cm2. In this way the concentration changes induced in the ion implanted region can be quantified. Linear calibration curves were obtained for an accurate quantification and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was employed to extract the starting stoichiometry in the unimplanted TiN film and to assess the chemical state along the depth profiles in the implanted samples. After implantation a swelling of the films was observed and has been discussed. SIMS profiles were measures both by cesium and oxygen primary beams. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

First, an intermediate state of reduction, the skeletal mechanism, is reached by means of sensitivity analysis and reaction-rate analysis. After that, a systematic method for reducing mechanisms based on the steady-state hypothesis and the partial equilibrium assumption is used. The reduced mechanism is obtained via an algebraic procedure. This mechanism consists of 18 lumped reaction steps and 22 chemical species. Both the skeletal and reduced mechanisms are validated by comparison with the results predicted by the detailed mechanism for the main species in methane combustion (CH4, CO, and CO2) in a wide range of operating conditions and generally show good agreement.",,"Combustion; Phase equilibria; Reaction kinetics; Reduction; Sensitivity analysis; Augmented reduced mechanism; Methane combustion; Reaction rate analysis; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942536633

The CBr3 + cation reacts further with BrOTeF5 to give CBr(OTeF 5)2+, C(OTeF5)3 +, and Br2. The [XeOTeF5][Sb(OTeF 5)6] salt was also found to react with BrOTeF5 in SO2ClF solvent at -78 °C to give the Br(OTeF5) 2+ cation. The CCl3+, CBr 3+, CBr(OTeF5)2+, C(OTeF5)3+, and Br(OTeF5) 2+ cations and C(OTeF5)4 have been characterized in SO2ClF solution by 13C and/or 19F NMR spectroscopy at -78 °C.

The optimized bond lengths and the topological analysis of the electron density show that the central carbon atom in the parent dianion C52- has a planar local environment, and it is coordinated to four other carbon atoms. The bonding of the parent dianion with the metal cations is highly ionic. The magnetic properties show that the C52- derivatives are strongly diatropic and have a remarkable transferability of structural and electronic features from the anion to the salts.

Two types of temperature enhancements, the low-latitude to midlatitude mesosphere inversion layer (MIL) and the high-latitude winter stratosphere temperature enhancement (STE), have both received much attention within the atmospheric science community because of their unexplained formation mechanisms and potential impacts on the middle-atmosphere global circulation. Numerous experimental, numerical, and theoretical studies have attempted to explain certain aspects of these respective thermal layers, but no one theory consistently and satisfactorily describes all the features observed. We present a review of the literature and explicitly propose a classification scheme based on the different formation mechanisms suspected to cause these events. For the MIL we demonstrate that there are two subtypes. The first one is tidally driven and tends to occur above ∼85 km. This MIL originates from large-amplitude tidal waves propagating into the mesosphere and their subsequent nonlinear interactions with gravity waves, which can often create the appearance of a ""double MIL"" separated by approximately one vertical tidal wavelength (∼25 km). The other subtype of MIL is formed by a climatological planetary wave dissipation mechanism that occurs at a zerowind line. The dissipation of the planetary wave tends to generate a mesoscale (∼1000 km) inversion layer in the range of 65-80 km. These two formation mechanisms explain a host of observed characteristics, including the reason behind the downward progression of some MlLs and not others, the different climatological nature of the two forms of MIL events, and the relative scarcity of MIL observations at high latitudes. The STE is believed to be generated by an altogether different process, namely, the nonlinear interaction between the polar vortex and planetary waves/Aleutian High. The induced temperatures typically peak around 40 km and often exceed 300 K, generating what appears to be a ""low, hot stratopause."" When vertical temperature profiles are combined with synoptic analyses, one observes that the STE is the consequence of high-latitude vortex interactions creating a baroclinic atmosphere, i.e., a downward adiabatic compression induced by an ageostropic flow. We summarize the details of the relationship between this feature and sudden stratospheric warmings, as well as the potential for in situ gravity wave generation. We close with a review of currently unexplained MIL/STE features and offer new directions for future middle-atmosphere thermal layer research.

It phosphorylates/dephosphorylates the HPr protein of the bacterial phosphotransferase system on a regulatory serine residue in response to the nutrient status of the cell. In Mycoplasma pneumoniae, HPrK/P is one of the very few regulatory proteins encoded in the genome. The regulation of this enzyme by metabolites is unique among HPrK/P proteins studied so far: it is active as a kinase at low ATP concentrations, whereas the proteins from other bacteria need high ATP concentrations as an indicator of a good nutrient supply for kinase activity. We studied the interaction of M. pneumoniae HPrK/P with ATP, Fru1,6P2 and P i by fluorescence spectroscopy. In agreement with the previously observed unique regulation, we found a very high affinity for ATP (K d = 5.4 μM) compared with the HPrK/P proteins from other bacteria. The Kd for Fru1,6P2 was three orders of magnitude higher, which explains why Fru1,6P2 has only a weak regulatory effect on M. pneumoniae HPrK/ P. Mutations of two important regions in the active site of HPrK/P, the nucleotide binding P-loop and the HPrK/P family signature sequence, had different effects. P-loop region mutations strongly affect ATP binding and thus all enzymatic functions, whereas the signature sequence motif seems to be important for the catalytic mechanism rather than for nucleotide binding.","Gram-positive bacteria; HPr kinase/phosphorylase; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Nutrients; Regulation","adenosine triphosphate; phosphorylase; phosphotransferase; protein derivative; amino acid sequence; article; bacterial mutation; bacterial strain; binding affinity; catalysis; catalyst; concentration response; controlled study; enzyme activity; fluorescence spectroscopy; molecular biology; molecular interaction; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; nonhuman; priority journal; protein motif; protein phosphorylation; regulatory mechanism; species comparison; Adenosine Triphosphate; Bacterial Proteins; Fructosediphosphates; Gene Expression Regulation, Bacterial; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Mutation; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Phosphates; Phosphorylation; Protein Binding; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Recombinant Proteins; Spectrometry, Fluorescence; Actinobacteria (class); Bacteria (microorganisms); Mycoplasma; Mycoplasma pneumoniae; Posibacteria; uncultured actinomycete",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642480263

This is particularly true of the world's semiarid and arid zones, where the contributions of mountains to total discharge are 50-90%. Taking into account the increasing water scarcity in these regions, especially for irrigation and food production, then today's state of knowledge in mountain hydrology makes sustainable water management and an assessment of vulnerability quite difficult. Following the IPCC report, the zone of maximum temperature increase in a 2 x CO 2 state extends from low elevation in the arctic and sub-arctic to high elevation in the tropics and subtropics. The planned GCOS climate stations do not reach this elevation of high temperature change, although there are many high mountain peaks with the necessary sensitive and vulnerable ecosystems. Worldwide, more than 700 million people live in mountain areas, of these, 625 million are in developing countries. Probably more than half of these 625 million people are vulnerable to food insecurity. Consequences of this insecurity can be emigration or overuse of mountain ecosystems. Overuse of the ecosystems will, ultimately, have negative effects on the environment and especially on water resources.

For such accounting, the 1990 flux is needed and, therefore, a correct knowledge of the baseline (1990) C stocks is necessary. In addition, a correct methodology should be used to investigate the capacity of ecosystems to sequester C through changes in land use or management by the end of the first commitment period (2008-2012). At national and regional scales, formulation of baseline C stocks in terrestrial ecosystems is difficult and uncertain. Differences in method of analysis, sampling depth of soil, lack of sufficient C data and the necessity to extrapolate C data to total soil organic C stocks, provide problems when comparing databases with each other. In this study, three extrapolation models were compared with the classical layer-based method to determine the model with the best fit.

However, information about environmental controls on physiology and consequent effects on species boundaries and ecosystem functions such as production is limited, especially for forested wetlands that are potentially important carbon sinks. Location: The bald cypress (Taxodium distichum) region of the south-eastern United States was studied to examine how production of an important forested wetland varies with latitude and temperature as well as local hydrology. Methods: We used published data to analyse litter production across a latitudinal gradient from 26.2 to 37.8° N to determine how bald cypress swamps might respond to alternate climate conditions and what changes might occur throughout the distributional range. Results: Litterfall rates followed a bell shaped curve, indicating that production was more limited at the distributional boundaries (c. 225 g/m2 year-1) compared to the mid-range (795-1126 g/m2 year-1). This pattern suggests that conditions are sub-optimal near both boundaries and that the absence of populations outside this latitudinal range may be largely due to physiological constraints on the carbon balance of dominant species. While dispersal limitations cannot be totally discounted, competition with other wetland types at the extremes of the range does not seem likely to be important because the relative basal area of bald cypress does not decrease near the edges of the range. Impaired hydrology depressed production across the entire range, but more in the south than the north. Main conclusions: Our findings suggest that (1) physiological limitations constrain biotic boundaries of bald cypress swamps; (2) future changes in global temperature would affect litter production in a nonlinear manner across the distributional range; (3) local changes in hydrology may interact with climate to further reduce litter production, particularly at lower latitudes; and (4) southernmost forests could be extirpated if environmental conditions compromise carbon balance and water-use efficiency of trees. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biotic boundary; Curvilinear model; Distribution; Global climate change; Impoundment; Litter production; Taxodium distichum; Temperature","climate change; environmental change; global warming; latitudinal gradient; leaf litter; physiology; prediction; biological production; boundary condition; carbon sink; coniferous tree; growth response; hydrology; litterfall; population distribution; temperature effect; wetland; Cupressus; Taxodium; Taxodium distichum; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642586430

A multi-camera system automatically estimates vehicle idle time and stop rates per itinerary; each vehicle is affected a cost that depends on whether it stops at least once and on its idle time on red. Elementary costs are calibrated using real urban driving cycles and their corresponding emission profiles measured on test benches. These experimental data are used to calibrate average coefficients for catalyst converter gasoline vehicles, non-catalyst ones and diesel vehicles (passenger cars). An on-field experiment was performed during 8 months to evaluate the benefits of the CRONOS control strategy, compared to a time plan strategy with vehicle actuated ranges. The benefits observed have shown the potential of this adaptive real-time control strategy that uses video traffic sensors. Large benefits on stops and delay induce significant reduction in environmental damage: 4% reduction for CO2 emission in peak traffic whatever the type of engine, which corresponds to 14% reduction on the part of costs due to stops and delay.

The intelligent method is an artificial neural network approach in which the urban heat island intensity at day and nighttime are estimated using as inputs several climatic parameters. Various neural network architectures are designed and trained for the output estimation, which is the daytime and nighttime urban heat island intensity at each station for a two-year time period. The results are tested with extensive sets of non-training measurements and it is found that they correspond well with the actual values. Furthermore, the influence of several input climatic parameters measured at each station, such as solar radiation, daytime and nighttime air temperature, and maximum daily air temperature, on the urban heat island intensity fluctuations is investigated and analyzed separately for the day and nighttime period. From this investigation it is shown that heat island intensity is mainly influenced by urbanization factors.

The results of multidisciplinary investigations at the Håkon Mosby mud volcano (HMMV) in the Norwegian Sea at ∼ 1250 m water depth are reviewed in this paper. Seafloor morphology, lithotypes, geochemical, and biological processes at the HMMV are concentrically zoned. The zonation is controlled by ejection of sediment, water, and gases (mainly methane) accompanied by high heat flow in the mud volcano crater. A structural gas hydrate accumulation is associated with the HMMV. Gas hydrate is abundant only in a relatively narrow zone where optimal conditions (low temperature and high gas concentration) exist for gas hydrate crystallization. Authigenic minerals, bacterial mats, and chemosynthetic communities typical of cold seep environments are present. Rapid anaerobic sulfate-dependant oxidation of methane is thought to be mediated by a consortium of methanogens and sulfate-reducing bacteria. Although methane is oxidized in sediments at high rates, a significant portion of this gas may escape into the ocean, mainly as diffuse flux. In the water column, methane is rapidly dissolved and oxidized. This observation supports the hypothesis that gas flux from deep-water mud volcanoes contributes to the oceanic carbon pool, but not to the atmosphere. The HMMV represents an important natural laboratory and provides insight to processes at the interface of methane-rich sediments and cold bottom water in the deep ocean. Future studies may best focus on accurate direct measurements of gas flux and quantification of the biogeochemical cycling of major chemical elements in shallow sediment. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

A previous study with an atmospheric general circulation model (AGCM) indicates that dust radiative forcing in the present-day climate reduces emission of dust into the atmosphere. Here, we interpret this reduction as an interaction between dust radiative forcing and the planetary boundary layer (PBL). By reducing sunlight incident upon the surface, dust decreases the turbulent flux of sensible heat into the atmosphere. This reduces turbulent mixing within the PBL, along with the downward transport of momentum to the surface, resulting in a decrease of surface wind speed and dust emission. We illustrate this mechanism by comparing the diurnal cycle of emission simulated by two versions of an AGCM, one containing dust radiative forcing, and the other with this forcing set to zero. At some of the most productive source regions, morning emission is reduced in proportion to the surface radiative forcing. We suggest that this negative feedback is underestimated by the AGCM.

The climate response depends not only upon the TOA forcing, but its difference with respect to the surface value, which represents radiative heating within the atmosphere. Surface forcing alters evaporation and the hydrologic cycle, which feeds back upon the aerosol burden through the efficiency of wet deposition. We calculate the surface forcing by soil dust aerosols and its global sensitivity by varying aspects of the dust distribution that are poorly constrained by observations. Ignorance of the global dust burden corresponds to a forcing uncertainty of over a factor of two, with smaller uncertainties due to imprecise knowledge of particle optical properties and the particle size distribution. While global evaporation and precipitation are reduced in response to surface radiative forcing by dust, precipitation increases locally over desert regions, so that dust emission can act as a negative feedback to desertification. The effect of the global reduction in precipitation is to lengthen the particle lifetime by reducing the efficiency of wet deposition, representing a positive feedback upon the global dust burden. For the current climate, we calculate the reduction in wet deposition by dust radiative forcing and find that the aerosol burden is increased only modestly. However, the global dust burden and associated radiative forcing are substantially higher during glacial climates, so that the amplification of the dust load by this feedback is larger. By extrapolating from its radiative forcing in the current climate, we estimate that dust reduces precipitation during glacial times by as much as half the reduction due to the colder climate alone.

The approach includes two stages: first, the measures under consideration are evaluated on the basis of a cost effectiveness analysis, which takes into account only the related net financial costs, thus highlighting win-win actions (i.e. measures presenting an economic benefit for end users without the provision of any economic subsidies or other similar policies); and second, the measures are re-evaluated using an integrated cost benefit analysis (where both the private and external costs/benefits are taken into account). The economic performance of the measures examined incorporates the effects of a variety of parameters, such as the region's climate, size and age of buildings, etc., which significantly affect the resulting ranking. The implementation of this framework in the Greek residential sector identified and prioritized a significant emissions reduction potential, which could be achieved with win-win measures and/or interventions that present a net social benefit. Measures with negative economic cost but positive net social benefit for the majority of the buildings examined include: (i) regular inspection of central heating boilers, (ii) use of thermostats in central heating boilers, (iii) sealing of openings, (iv) installation of solar collectors for hot water etc. The monetization of environmental benefits is shown to provide a powerful tool for highlighting priority actions in the context of a climate change mitigation policy. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

However, some urban areas in South Asia are clean and modern, with concrete housing, vehicle emission regulations and use of smoke-free household fuel. The purpose of this study was to compare wheeze prevalence in 13-14-year-olds between two South Asian cities (Galle, Chandigarh), representing each of the above two archetypes. The validated one-page International Study on Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) questionnaire for 13-14-year-olds was used for the study. Of 1814 distributed questionnaires, 1737 (95.8%) were completed correctly and returned (Galle: n = 1162; Chandigarh: n = 575). Crude prevalence rates, and prevalence odds ratios (with 95% two-sided confidence intervals (CI) for comparison of prevalence rates), were calculated. The prevalence rate for wheezing in Galle (28.7%) was higher than in Chandigarh (12.5%). The prevalence odds ratios (Galle versus Chandigarh) for lifetime wheezing (2.3; 1.8-2.9), wheezing in the previous year (2.1; 1.6-2.7), exercise-related wheeze (4.8; 3.5-6.7) and physician-diagnosed wheeze (1.7; 1.2-2.3) demonstrated significant differences in wheeze prevalence between the two cities (P < 0.05). The numbers of 13-14-year-olds experiencing less than 12 wheezing episodes per year or sleep disturbance due to wheeze of less than 1 night per week were also significantly higher for Galle than Chandigarh. There is a higher prevalence of wheeze in 13-14-year-old children living in an old-fashioned, congested city than in a clean and modern city in South Asia.","Children; South Asia; Wheeze","adolescent; allergy; article; asthma; confidence interval; controlled study; exercise; female; human; major clinical study; male; prevalence; priority journal; questionnaire; sleep disorder; South Asia; statistical significance; urban area; wheezing; Adolescent; Air Pollution; Female; Humans; India; Male; Odds Ratio; Prevalence; Respiratory Hypersensitivity; Respiratory Sounds; Sri Lanka; Urban Population",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542327597

Live plant biomass, standing dead, litter, and root biomass and soil (to 60 cm depth) were assessed to provide estimates of quantity and distribution of vegetation, soil and total ecosystem C and N. Soil profile N mass was significantly higher for both mechanical treatments compared to the nontreated control. Both the single and double ripped plots also showed significantly higher quantities of total ecosystem N than their respective controls. Neither mechanical treatment, however, had a significant effect on soil or total ecosystem organic C mass or distribution. The ""tillage effect"" of the mechanical renovation treatments may account for the lack of organic C response because of enhanced decomposition and oxidation of soil organic C during initial treatment implementation.","Carbon sequestration; Mechanical treatments; Nutrient cycling; Rangeland renovation; Rangelands; Ripping","carbon sequestration; grassland; grazing management; nutrient cycling; prairie; rangeland; North America; United States; Wyoming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842716567

Japan's conciliatory proposals had nothing to do with bilateral pressure from the United States. Why, then, did Japan make special efforts to conciliate with the United States, and offer lenient proposals? I focus on three factors: concern for international status, the costs of the climate change regime and domestic politics. My main argument is that the Japanese Ministry of International Trade and Industry used 'conciliation' with the United States in its favor as an excuse for making proposals that would emasculate the climate change regime and as a means of receiving support from the United States for differentiation of national targets on greenhouse gas emissions. © Oxford University Press and the Japan Association of International Relations 2004.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85045156445

The Šoštanj TPP is the exclusive source of SO2 in the area and is therefore a perfect example for air pollution studies. In order to understand air pollution around the Šoštanj TPP in detail, some analyses of emissions and ambient concentrations of SO 2 at six automated monitoring stations in the surroundings of the TPP were made. The data base from 1991 to 1993 was used when there were no desulfurisation plants in operation. Statistical analyses of the influence of the emissions from the three TPP stacks at different measuring points were made. The analyses prove that the smallest stack (100 m) mainly pollutes villages and towns near the TPP within a radius of a few kilometres. The medium stack's (150 m) influence is noticed at shorter as well as at longer distances up to more than ten kilometres. The highest stack (230 m) pollutes mainly at longer distances, where the plume reaches the higher hills. Detailed analyses of ambient SO2 concentrations were made. They show the temporal and spatial distribution of different classes of SO2 concentrations from very low to alarming values. These analyses show that pollution patterns at a particular station remain the same if observed on a yearly basis, but can vary very much if observed on a monthly basis, mainly because of different weather patterns. Therefore the winds in the basin (as the most important feature influencing air pollution dispersion) were further analysed in detail to find clusters of similar patterns. For cluster analysis of ground-level winds patterns in the basin around the Šoštanj Thermal Power Plant, the Kohonen neural network and Leaders' method were used. Furthermore, the dependence of ambient SO2 concentrations on the clusters obtained was analysed. The results proved that effective cluster analysis can be a useful tool for compressing a huge wind data base in order to find the correlation between winds and pollutant concentrations. The analyses made provide a better insight into air pollution over complex terrain. © Societè Italians di Fisica.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19944385925

We established how levels of relatedness - the maternal family, population, and provenance - affect variation in the CO2 response of a species. This 2-year growth chamber experiment focused on the germination, growth, biomass allocation, and survivorship responses of Acer rubrum to four concentrations of CO2: 180, 270, 360, and 600 μLL-1 - representing Pleistocene through potential future conditions. We found that all levels of relatedness interacted with CO2 to contribute to variation in response. Germination responses to CO2 varied among families and populations, growth responses depended on families and regions of origin, and survivorship responses to CO2 were particularly affected by regional identities. Differences among geographic regions accounted for 23% of the variation in biomass response to CO2. If seeds produced under subambient CO2 conditions behave similarly, our results suggest that A. rubrum may have experienced strong selection on seedling survivorship at Pleistocene CO2 levels. Further, this species may evolve in response to globally rising CO2 so as to increase productivity above that experimentally observed today. Species responses to future atmospheric CO2 and the accompanying biotic effects on the global carbon cycle will vary among families, populations, and provenances. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Acer rubrum; CO2 evolutionary ecology; Genetic variation; Global change; Red maple","carbon dioxide enrichment; evolution; genetic variation; germination; global change; growth; survivorship; Acer; Acer rubrum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642447814

Many of these urban centers are expanding rapidly, leading to the growth of megacities, which are often defined as metropolitan areas with populations exceeding 10 million inhabitants. These concentrations of people and activity are exerting increasing stress on the natural environment, with impacts at urban, regional and global levels. In recent decades, air pollution has become one of the most important problems of megacities. Initially, the main air pollutants of concern were sulfur compounds, which were generated mostly by burning coal. Today, photochemical smog—induced primarily from traffic, but also from industrial activities, power generation, and solvents—has become the main source of concern for air quality, while sulfur is still a major problem in many cities of the developing world. Air pollution has serious impacts on public health, causes urban and regional haze, and has the potential to contribute significantly to global climate change. Yet, with appropriate planning megacities can efficiently address their air quality problems through measures such as application of new emission control technologies and development of mass transit systems. This review is focused on nine urban centers, chosen as case studies to assess air quality from distinct perspectives: from cities in the industrialized nations to cities in the developing world. This review considers not only megacities, but also urban centers with somewhat smaller populations, for while each city—its problems, resources, and outlook—is unique, the need for a holistic approach to complex environmental problems is the same. There is no single strategy to reduce air pollution in megacities; a mix of policy measures will be needed to improve air quality. Experience shows that strong political will coupled with public dialogue is essential to effectively implement the regulations required to address air quality. © 2004 Air and Waste Management Association.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84984540037

Today, photochemical smog—induced primarily from traffic, but also from industrial activities, power generation, and solvents—has become the main source of concern for air quality, while sulfur is still a major problem in many cities of the developing world. Air pollution has serious impacts on public health, causes urban and regional haze, and has the potential to contribute significantly to climate change. Yet, with appropriate planning, megacities can efficiently address their air quality problems through measures such as application of new emission control technologies and development of mass transit systems. This review is focused on nine urban centers, chosen as case studies to assess air quality from distinct perspectives: from cities in the industrialized nations to cities in the developing world. While each city—its problems, resources, and outlook—is unique, the need for a holistic approach to the complex environmental problems is the same. There is no single strategy in reducing air pollution in megacities; a mix of policy measures will be needed to improve air quality. Experience shows that strong political will coupled with public dialog is essential to effectively implement the regulations required to address air quality problems. © 2004 Air & Waste Management Association.",,"Atmospherics; Environmental impact; Population statistics; Solvents; Urban planning; Magacities; Metropolitan areas; Public areas; Pollution; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality standard; city; climate change; combustion; environmental impact assessment; exhaust gas; health hazard; photochemical smog; policy; pollution control; pollution monitoring; pollution transport; population growth; priority journal; review; smog; visibility",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942526964

Using new data on Holocene sedimentation rates, we estimated the annual organic carbon accumulation in the pelagic realm (&gt;3000 m water depth) to be approximately 1.8 x 1012 g C year-1. In the sediments underlying the divergence zone in the Eastern Equatorial Atlantic (EEA), only small amounts of organic carbon accumulate in spite of the high surface water productivity observed in that area. This implies that in the Eastern Equatorial Atlantic, organic carbon accumulation is strongly reduced by efficient degradation of organic matter prior to its burial. During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM), accumulation of organic carbon was higher than during the mid-Holocene along the continental margins of Africa and South America (Brazil) as well as in the equatorial region. In the Eastern Equatorial Atlantic in particular, large relative differences between LGM and mid-Holocene accumulation rates are found. This is probably to a great extent due to better preservation of organic matter related to changes in bottom water circulation and not just a result of strongly enhanced export productivity during the glacial period. On average, a two- to three-fold increase in organic carbon accumulation during the LGM compared to mid-Holocene conditions can be deduced from our cores. However, for the deep-sea sediments this cannot be solely attributed to a glacial productivity increase, as changes in South Atlantic deep-water circulation seem to result in better organic carbon preservation during the LGM. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

One of the most relevant impacts is health effects associated with high pollution periods. Madrid is a city that suffers chronic congestion levels and some periods of very stable atmospheric conditions; as a result, pollution levels exceed air quality standards for certain pollutants. This paper focuses on the social evaluation of transport-related emissions. A new methodology to evaluate those impacts in monetary terms has been designed and applied to Madrid. The method takes into account costs associated with losses in working time, mortality and human suffering; calculated using an impact pathway approach linked to CORINAIR emissions. This also allows the calculation of social costs associated with greenhouse gas impacts. As costs have been calculated individually by effect and mode of transport, they can be used to design pricing policies based on real social costs. This paper concludes that the health and social costs of transport-related air pollution in Madrid is 357 Meuro. In these circumstances, the recent public health tax applied in Madrid is clearly correct and sensible with a fair pricing policy on car use. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In the control experiment the mean annual zonally averaged climate is well simulated by the model when compared with observed data. Biomass burning plays an important role on the earth's radiative balance and climate through the release of large amounts of greenhouse gases and aerosols in the atmosphere and the alteration of the land surface characteristics. For investigating the relative importance of these changes five experiments are performed: (1) degradation of the surface, (2) change in the smoke aerosols concentration, (3) change in the CO2 concentration, (4) change in CH4 concentration, and (5) all the changes together. The results show that biomass burning in Amazonian forest causes a reduction in the absorbed solar radiation and net radiation fluxes at the surface in the perturbed region and an increase in the air surface temperature and the net thermal infrared radiation flux at the surface. Also there is a decrease in the latent and sensible heat fluxes, evapotranspiration and precipitation compared to the control case. In general, the greater changes in the radiative balance and climate are due mainly to the changes in the land surface characteristics, followed by those caused by the large amounts of smoke aerosols released in the atmosphere. The changes due to the greenhouse gases CO2 and CH4 are small.

This general statement is mostly based on studies from extra-tropical mountains and has been rarely evaluated in subtropical latitudes frequently characterized by drier climates. In the subtropical mountains from Northwestern Argentina (∼23° S), annual precipitation decreases with elevation from >1500 mm at 1200-1500 m, to <200 mm above 4000 m. In consequence, tree growth at high elevations in the region may be seriously limited by water supply. In order to assess the influence of precipitation on tree growth, we evaluated the relationships between climatic variations and radial growth in four species growing at different altitudinal zones: Juglans australis from the montane cloud forest at 1800 m; Alnus acuminata from the montane savanna-like woodland at 2700 m; Prosopis ferox from the subalpine dryland at 3500 m; and Polylepis tarapacana from the high-elevation alpine dryland, at 4750 m. Dendrochronological techniques were used to relate variations in annual ring width with instrumental climatic records. Growth rings were correctly dated to the year of formation, and the cross-dated series standardized using autoregressive models to reduce non-climatic signals present in the records. Tree-ring chronologies, ranging from 117 to 341 years, were compared, during the common period, with instrumental climatic records using correlation-function analysis. In spite of the remarkable differences in elevation and environmental conditions among the sampling sites, correlation functions with climate indicated that the radial growth of the four species is largely controlled by precipitation. In most cases, increased precipitation during the previous and current growing seasons favors tree growth, while temperatures are negatively correlated with radial growth, likely due to the negative effect on water availability. These results indicate that the generalized idea of upper-treeline growth limited by summer temperatures should be carefully evaluated in low-latitude environments and does not apply to subtropical areas with severe water deficits or strong moisture seasonalities.","Alnus acuminata; Altitudinal range; Argentina, Northwestern; Dendrochronology; Juglans australis; Polylepis tarapacana; Prosopis ferox; Rainfall-controlled growth; Subtropical trees; Treeline","dendrochronology; growth; limiting factor; rainfall; subtropical region; treeline; Argentina; South America; Western Hemisphere; World; Alnus; Alnus acuminata; Alnus acuminata; Betulaceae; Juglans; Juglans australis; Juglans australis; Polylepis; Polylepis tarapacana; Polylepis tarapacana; Prosopis; Prosopis ferox; Prosopis ferox",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9244237678

In reality, this condition is almost never met because the transport medium tends to be optically thin for photons of sufficiently high frequency. Motivated by this fact, we derive a new asymptotic limit of the radiative transfer equations that is characterized by two photon components: one for which the medium is optically thick and diffusive, and the other for which the medium is extremely optically thin. In this limit, the leading-order material temperature satisfies a time-dependent diffusion equation, and the leading-order radiation intensity for the optically thick photons is given by the Planck function evaluated at the leading-order material temperature, but the radiation intensity for the optically thin photons is zero through first order. The O(e2) radiation intensity for the optically thin photons satisfies a quasi steady-state transport equation with zero interaction terms and a Planck emission term that depends upon the leading-order material temperature. We also discuss alternative scalings associated with the two-component limit that are characterized by stronger coupling between the material and the optically thin component. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Herein we describe gas exchange, plant biomass and species responses of five native or semi-native temperate and Mediterranean grasslands and three semi-arid systems to CO2 enrichment, with an emphasis on water relations. Increasing CO2 led to decreased leaf conductance for water vapor, improved plant water status, altered seasonal evapotranspiration dynamics, and in most cases, periodic increases in soil water content. The extent, timing and duration of these responses varied among ecosystems, species and years. Across the grasslands of the Kansas tallgrass prairie, Colorado shortgrass steppe and Swiss calcareous grassland, increases in aboveground biomass from CO2 enrichment were relatively greater in dry years. In contrast, CO2-induced aboveground biomass increases in the Texas C3/C4 grassland and the New Zealand pasture seemed little or only marginally influenced by yearly variation in soil water, while plant growth in the Mojave Desert was stimulated by CO2 in a relatively wet year. Mediterranean grasslands sometimes failed to respond to CO 2-related increased late-season water, whereas semiarid Negev grassland assemblages profited. Vegetative and reproductive responses to CO 2 were highly varied among species and ecosystems, and did not generally follow any predictable pattern in regard to functional groups. Results suggest that the indirect effects of CO2 on plant and soil water relations may contribute substantially to experimentally induced CO 2-effects, and also reflect local humidity conditions. For landscape scale predictions, this analysis calls for a clear distinction between biomass responses due to direct CO2 effects on photosynthesis and those indirect CO2 effects via soil moisture as documented here. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Biomass; Carbon dioxide enrichment; Landscape predictions; Soil water; Stomata","carbon dioxide; rain; water; biomass; carbon dioxide enrichment; desert; gas exchange; grassland; growth; water relations; air; article; biomass; climate; ecosystem; human; photosynthesis; physiology; plant leaf; Poaceae; sweating; Air; Biomass; Carbon Dioxide; Climate; Ecosystem; Humans; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Plant Transpiration; Poaceae; Rain; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942544440

This paper considers a slice of the question by examining the near-term impact on domestic manufacturing industries of both upstream (economy-wide) and downstream (electric power industry only) carbon mitigation policies. Detailed Census data on the electricity use of four-digit manufacturing industries are combined with input-output information on inter-industry purchases to paint a detailed picture of carbon use, including effects on final demand. Regional information on electricity supply and use by region is also incorporated. A relatively simple model is developed which yields estimates of the relative burdens within the manufacturing sector of alternative carbon policies. Overall, the principal conclusion is that within the manufacturing sector (which by definition excludes coal production and electricity generation), only a small number of industries would bear a disproportionate short-term burden of a carbon tax or similar policy. Not surprisingly, an electricity-only policy affects very different manufacturing industries than an economy-wide carbon tax. © 2003 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Distribution of carbon mitigation costs; Industrial impacts of carbon policies","Air pollution control; Carbon; Electric power plants; Electric utilities; Energy policy; Greenhouse effect; Industrial emissions; Greenhouse gases (GHG); Greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions; Mitigation policies; Particulate emissions; carbon emission; emission control; manufacturing; mitigation; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442621361

The model has been developed to assess the potential contribution of fossil, biomass, nuclear and other energy technologies and land-use changes to future GHG emissions. In this paper, the MARIA model is extended to evaluate a new hydrogen production process through steam-methane reforming at a significantly lower temperature (300-500 °C) than that of conventional steam-methane reforming processes as a liquid fuel supplier under the long-term global warming strategies. Bern simple carbon cycle model is also included in the model to reflect the recent findings in climate science. The simulation results suggest that hydrogen with Fast Breeder Reactors could supply 5-8 GTOE of hydrogen in the second half of the 21st century when climate policy that stabilizes the atmospheric carbon concentration is introduced. Although biomass does not completely replace fossil energy sources, the simulations show that it effectively mitigates the marginal cost of carbon emission. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.All rights reserved.","Climate change; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; Hydrogen production; Integrated assessment model","Fossil fuels; Global warming; Greenhouse effect; Hydrogen; Reforming reactions; Resource allocation; Carbon cycle model; Climate science; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission; Nuclear energy; alternative energy; carbon emission; global warming; hydrogen; mitigation; nuclear power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9144251149

Mid-IR emission-line intensities are predicted, and diagnostic diagrams of [Ne III/II] and [S IV/III] excitation ratios are built, taking into account the metallicities of both the star and the H II region. The diagrams are used in conjunction with Galactic H II region observations obtained with the Infrared Space Observatory to determine the effective temperature Teff of the exciting O stars and the mean ionization parameter Ū, where T eff and Ū are found to increase and decrease, respectively, with the metallicity of the H II region represented by the Ne/Ne ⊙ ratio. No evidence is found for gradients of Teff or Ū with Galactocentric distance RGal. The observed excitation sequence with RGal is mainly due to the effect of the metallicity gradient on the spectral ionizing shape, upon which the effect of an increase in Teff with Z is superposed. We show that not taking properly into account the effect of metallicity on the ionizing shape of the stellar atmosphere would lead to an apparent decrease of Teff with Z and an increase of Teff with RGal.","Galaxy: stellar content; H II regions; Infrared: ISM; Stars: atmospheres; Stars: fundamental parameters; Supergiants",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842480956

Anthropogenic climate change will happen – and, if unabated – with catastrophic consequences. More extreme weather events, sea–level rise, and a hotter and drier climate are some of the predicted outcomes seriously affecting people’s choice of where to live on an increasingly crowded planet. Climate–induced migration is not new, as already in the past people moved when faced by environmental change; but today, population densities have increased dramatically, and arable land has become more limited. Large cross-border streams of ‘climate migrants’ or ‘environmental refugees‘ caused by tropical cyclones, associated flooding and landslides, droughts, and sea-level rise could trigger resource competition with violent outcomes in the receiving country or region. But can these claims be substantiated? This chapter examines different types of natural hazards relevant for climate-induced migration, and argues that without an analysis identifying the people most vulnerable to natural hazards (for example, where they live and how they are affected), it is difficult to access the conflict potential of climate-induced migration. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874019779

These composites were fabricated by the two-dimensional lay-up of 0/90 five-harness satin fabric consisting of Sylramic fiber tows that were then chemical vapor infiltrated (CVI) with BN, CVI with SiC, slurry infiltrated with SiC particles followed by molten infiltration of Si. The composites varied in number of plies, the number of tows per length, thickness, and the effective-size of the tows. This resulted in composites with a fiber volume fraction in the load-bearing direction that ranged from 0.12 to 0.20. Matrix cracking was monitored with modal acoustic emission in order to estimate the stress-dependent distribution of matrix cracks. It was found that the general matrix crack properties of this system could be fairly well characterized by assuming that no matrix cracks originated in the load-bearing fiber, interphase, chemical vapor infiltrated SiC tow-minicomposites, i.e., all matrix cracks originate in the 90° tow regions or the large unreinforced SiC-Si matrix regions. Also, it was determined that the higher fiber-count tow composites had a much narrower stress range for matrix cracking compared to the standard tow size composites. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The stochastically cooled proton beam and the used detection system allowed to determine the momenta of the outgoing protons with a precision of 4 MeV/c (σ) in the center-of-mass frame. The determination of the four-momentum vectors of both outgoing protons allowed to derive the complete kinematical information of the ηpp system. An unexpectedly large enhancement of the occupation density in the kinematical regions of low proton-η relative momenta is observed. A description taking the proton-proton and the η-proton interaction into account and assuming an on-shell incoherent pair-wise interaction among the produced particles fails to explain this strong effect. Its understanding will require a rigorous three-body approach to the pp η system and the precise determination of contributions from higher partial waves. We also present an invariant mass spectrum of the proton-proton system determined at Q =4.5 MeV. Interestingly, the enhancement at large relative momenta between protons is visible also at such a small excess energy.

This was investigated in a South African C4-dominated grassland community exposed to elevated atmospheric CO2 in a three-year microcosm experiment. Elevated CO2 generally caused earlier sprouting and flowering by one to one and half weeks, and delayed senescence by two weeks. However the magnitude of these phenological responses was species specific, and sometimes dependent on water supply. Effects of elevated CO2 on canopy structure were most apparent in upper canopy layers at heights of between 20-40cm and 40-60cm above ground where higher leaf biomasses were produced than in those microcosm communities grown under ambient atmospheric CO2. Plant species most responsive to atmospheric CO 2 enhancement were Sporobolus pyramidalis and Themeda triandra. It is concluded that responses of community canopy structure to elevated CO 2 may be dependent on water supply, and that species competitive interactions may influence community response to abiotic stress.",,"C4 plant; canopy architecture; carbon dioxide enrichment; competition (ecology); microcosm; phenology; Sporobolus; Sporobolus pyramidalis; Themeda; Themeda triandra; Themeda triandra",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13444272029

The present study is an ongoing approach to assess the dose-related percutaneous absorption of a number of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons.

Other treatments (n = 4 cells) were 2X and 5X concentrations. Perfusate samples were analyzed with gas chromatography-flame ionization detector (GC-FID) using head space solid phase micro-extraction fiber technique. We have standardized the assay to have a good linear correlation for all the tested components in media standards. Absorption parameters including diffusivity, permeability, steady state flux, and percent dose absorbed were estimated for all the tested hydrocarbons. This approach provides a baseline to access component interactions among themselves and with the diluent (solvents). A quantitative structure permeability relationship (QSPR) model was derived to predict the permeability of unknown jet fuel hydrocarbons in this solvent system by using their physicochemical parameters.

Na+ ions were found to penetrate deep into the ester region of the water/lipid interface of the bilayer. Interaction of the Na+ ions with the lipid bilayer is accompanied by a loss of water molecules around the ion and a simultaneous increase in the number of ester carbonyl oxygen atoms binding the ion, which define an octahedral and square pyramidal geometry. The amine group of the lipid molecule is involved in the formation of inter- and intramolecular hydrogen bonds with the carboxylate and the phosphodiester groups of the lipid molecule. The area per lipid of the POPS bilayer is unaffected by the presence of 0.15M NaCl. There is a small increase in the order parameter of carbon atoms in the beginning of the alkyl chain in the presence of NaCl. This is due to a greater number of Na+ ions being coordinated by the ester carbonyl oxygen atoms in the water/lipid interface region of the POPS bilayer.",,"oxygen; palmitoyloleoylphosphatidylserine; phosphatidylserine; phospholipid; sodium chloride; sodium ion; unclassified drug; water; article; chemical structure; computer graphics; hydrogen bond; lipid bilayer; molecular dynamics; molecular interaction; molecular model; phospholipid bilayer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542285301

One problem in comparing ERE with laboratory photoluminescence (PL) measurements is given by the fact that laboratory samples are usually macroscopic in size, or very thin films, while interstellar dust particles are usually of sizes comparable to, or smaller than, the wavelength of visible light. We here apply a newly developed general recipe to extrapolate the expected PL of small, homogeneous spheres starting from the available laboratory results obtained for bulk samples, and infer previously unsuspected consequences for ERE-like PL phenomena.","Astrochemistry; ISM: dust, extinction; ISM: lines and bands; Methods: numerical; Radiation mechanisms: general; Scattering","Astrohemistry; ISM : dust, extinction; ISM : lines and bands; Radiation mechanisms; Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon; Dust; Irradiation; Mathematical models; Particle size analysis; Photoluminescence; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Astrophysics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042554536

Thus, inventorying carbon pools in these ecosystems has become important for understanding the global C budget. Tree dimensions, wood basic density and analyses of soil C concentration were used to quantify the biomass and C pools of the Eastern Arc Mountains of Tanzania. Tree C density was estimated as product of wood volume, basic density, and proportion of C in wood. Soil C density was estimated as product of soil volume, bulk density and per cent C. Tree biomass was 1055 ± 35 and 790 ± 20 t ha-1 for the Usambaras and Ulugurus respectively. These aggregated to 517 ± 17 t ha-1 C in the Usambaras and 388 ± 10 t ha-1 in the Ulugurus. The soil organic C density was 418 ± 100 t ha-1 in the Usambaras and 295 ± 53 t ha-1 in the Ulugurus. Mid-altitude plant communities had higher C storage potential compared with high altitude plants. This capacity for C storage, population pressure and the extensiveness of these forests in the region make their conservation a global significance for C emission mitigation.","Biomass; Mitigation; Plant communities; Soil organic carbon","Biomass; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climatology; Gas emissions; Plants (botany); Soils; Vegetation; Wood; Mitigation; Plant communities; Soil organic carbon; Forestry; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; Forestry; Meteorology; Plants; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542335500

When used to produce transport fuel either electricity is imported to power the plant or some of the biogas is used in a small CHP unit to meet electricity demand on site. The potential revenue from CH4-enriched biogas when replacing petrol is higher than that for replacing diesel (Irish prices). Transport fuel production when replacing petrol requires the least gate fee. The production of greenhouse-gas is generated with cognisance of greenhouse-gas production with the scheme not in place; landfill of the Organic Fraction of Municipal Solid Waste (OFMSW) (20% of biomass) with and without combustion of landfill gas is investigated. The transport scenario with importation of brown electricity generates more greenhouse-gas than petrol or diesel, when the 'do-nothing' case involves combustion of landfill gas. The preferred solution involves transport fuel production with the production of CHP to meet electricity demand on site.

Subtidal algae were typically restricted to the use of DIC in the form of dissolved CO2, reducing the initial DIC by only 9%. Intertidal species used both dissolved CO2 and bicarbonate and reduced initial DIC by as much as 70%. DIC reductions and pH compensation points for the intertidal species tested were strongly correlated with their vertical zonation on the rocky shoreline (analysis of variance). DIC acquisition efficiency increased with tidal height, but species from the upper edge of the intertidal demonstrated a reversal of this trend. This general pattern associated with tidal height was observed not only among intertidal red algae in general, but also among four species of the genus Porphyra (P. torta V. Krishnamurthy, P. papenfussii Krishnamurthy, P. perforata J. Agardh, P. fucicola Krishnamurthy) and among four populations of the broadly distributed species Mastocarpus papillatus (C. Agardh). The Mastocarpus observations suggest either that individuals of this species may be able to express alternate strategies for carbon acquisition or that intertidal height may select for survivorship of genotypes with different carbon acquisition strategies. Taken together, these data suggest that the carbon acquisition strategy of intertidal red algae may be an important physiological set of adaptations that is under active evolutionary selection. These physiological differences were not related to phylogeny, tested as membership in red algal families and orders.","Carbon uptake; Dissolved inorganic carbon; Intertidal; pH drift; Rhodophyta; Seaweed; Subtidal","dissolved inorganic carbon; macroalga; pH; red alga; seaweed; North America; Puget Sound; United States; Washington [United States]; algae; Eukaryota; Halophila; Mastocarpus; Mastocarpus papillatus; Porphyra; Porphyra fucicola; Porphyra papenfussii; Porphyra perforata; Porphyra torta; Rhodophyta",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6344287711

In the Ni/TiO2(0 0 1) system, an in-gap emission from the reduced Ti3+ 3d1 state appears at 1.2 e V below EF for the initial Ni deposition. Upon further deposition, the emission grows and is evolved to a spectrum of Ni metal, with forming no Fermi edge, suggesting the formation of small Ni clusters on TiO2(0 0 1). In the Cu/TiO2(1 1 0) system, Cu grows in a Stranski-Krastanov mode. Two in-gap emissions from the reduced Ti3+ 3d1 state and oxidized Cu+ 3d10 or Cu2+ 3d9 state are observed at 0.8 and 2.8 e V below EF, respectively, for the initial Cu deposition, giving convincing evidence that there is significant charge transfer between Cu and the substrate. Upon further deposition, the emission in the band-gap region is evolved to a spectrum of Cu metal, though delayed completion of the Fermi edge is observed.

The reasons are summarized as follows: (1) cool energy of snow is renewable and clean energy, (2) use of snow has possibility to reduce the peak demand of the electricity and may cause to reduce the emission of CO2, (3) air-conditioning utilizing stored snow may bring clean and comfortable air by dust absorption on the snow surface, and (4) stored snow may bring high-quality condition, high humidity and cold air temperature slightly over the ice melting point, for farm products warehouse. To spread the amount of use of snow, there must be low-cost method to store snow by summer with simple insulation. New insulation technology, which is developed by Kobiyama and his group, utilizing agricultural waste, such as rice husk, was tested 2002. Snow pile of 960m3 (490 t) covered by an insulation of rice husk layer having 15 or 30 cm thickness was constructed. It was shown that the snow melting rate is approximately 1.5 cm/d even in mid-summer, then it was concluded the rice husk insulation is effective enough to store large amount of snow. The thermo-physical properties were measured in laboratory, and then the model of heat transfer in the layer of rice husk was developed considering the heat conductivity, property of water absorption, and water-shedding quality. © 2004 by Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85055817339

Certain of these chemicals are listed by the state of California as toxic air contaminants (TACs) and a subset of these are regulated by the US federal government as hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). California's Proposition 65 list of species recognized as carcinogens or reproductive toxicants also includes constituents of certain cleaning products and air fresheners. In addition, many cleaning agents and air fresheners contain chemicals that can react with other air contaminants to yield potentially harmful secondary products. For example, terpenes can react rapidly with ozone in indoor air generating many secondary pollutants, including TACs such as formaldehyde. Furthermore, ozone-terpene reactions produce the hydroxyl radical, which reacts rapidly with organics, leading to the formation of other potentially toxic air pollutants. Indoor reactive chemistry involving the nitrate radical and cleaning-product constituents is also of concern, since it produces organic nitrates as well as some of the same oxidation products generated by ozone and hydroxyl radicals. Few studies have directly addressed the indoor concentrations of TACs that might result from primary emissions or secondary pollutant formation following the use of cleaning agents and air fresheners. In this paper, we combine direct empirical evidence with the basic principles of indoor pollutant behavior and with information from relevant studies, to analyze and critically assess air pollutant exposures resulting from the use of cleaning products and air fresheners. Attention is focused on compounds that are listed as HAPs, TACs or Proposition 65 carcinogens/reproductive toxicants and compounds that can readily react to generate secondary pollutants. The toxicity of many of these secondary pollutants has yet to be evaluated. The inhalation intake of airborne organic compounds from cleaning product use is estimated to be of the order of 10mgd-1person-1 in California. More than two dozen research articles present evidence of adverse health effects from inhalation exposure associated with cleaning or cleaning products. Exposure to primary and secondary pollutants depends on the complex interplay of many sets of factors and processes, including cleaning product composition, usage, building occupancy, emission dynamics, transport and mixing, building ventilation, sorptive interactions with building surfaces, and reactive chemistry. Current understanding is sufficient to describe the influence of these variables qualitatively in most cases and quantitatively in a few. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We analyzed MH sediments from West Olaf Lake (WOL) and Steel Lake (SL) in Minnesota to examine the effects of warm/dry climatic conditions on prairie-woodland ecosystems. Mineral composition and carbonate δ18O were used to determine climatic variations, whereas pollen assemblages, charcoal δ13C, and charcoal accumulation rates were used to reconstruct vegetation composition, C3 and C4 plant abundance, and fire. The ratio of aragonite/calcite at WOL and δ18O at SL suggest that pronounced droughts occurred during the MH but that drought severity decreased with time. From charcoal δ13C data we estimated that the MH abundance of C4 plants averaged 50% at WOL and 43% at SL. At WOL C4 abundance was negatively correlated with aragonite/calcite, suggesting that severe moisture deficits suppressed C4 plants in favor of weedy C3 plants (e.g., Ambrosia). As climate ameliorated C4 abundance increased (from ≈33 to 66%) at the expense of weedy species, enhancing fuel availability and fire occurrence. In contrast, farther east at SL where climate was cooler and wetter, C4 abundance showed no correlation with δ18O-inferred aridity. Woody C3 plants (e.g., Quercus) were more abundant, biomass flammability was lower, and fires were less important at SL than at WOL. Our results suggest that C 4 plants are adapted to warm/dry climatic conditions, but not to extreme droughts, and that the fire regime is controlled by biomass-climate interactions.",,"argon; calcium carbonate; charcoal; article; biomass; climate change; correlation analysis; ecology; forest; geographic distribution; greenhouse effect; holocene; lake ecosystem; nonhuman; plant; priority journal; sedimentology; United States; vegetable; weed; climate; ecosystem; plant physiology; Ambrosia; Quercus; Climate; Ecosystem; Minnesota; Plant Physiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0347635512

The frequency and severity of drought in the tropics may increase through stronger El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) episodes, global warming, and rainfall inhibition by land use change. However, little is known about the spatial and temporal patterns of drought in moist tropical forests, and the complex relationships between patterns of drought and forest fire regimes, tree mortality, and productivity. We present a simple geographic information system soil water balance model, called RisQue (Risco de Queimada - Fire Risk) for the Amazon basin that we use to conduct an analysis of these patterns for 1996-2001. RisQue features a map of maximum plant-available soil water (PAWmax) developed using 1565 soil texture profiles and empirical relationships between soil texture and critical soil water parameters. PAW is depleted by monthly evapotranspiration (ET) fields estimated using the Penman-Monteith equation and satellite-derived radiation inputs and recharged by monthly rain fields estimated from 266 meteorological stations. Modeled PAW to 10 m depth (PAW 10m) was similar to field measurements made in two Amazon forests. During the severe drought of 2001, PAW10m fell to below 25% of PAWmax in 31% of the region's forests and fell below 50% PAWmax in half of the forests. Field measurements and experimental forest fires indicate that soil moisture depletion below 25% PAWmax corresponds to a reduction in leaf area index of approximately 25%, increasing forest flammability. Hence, approximately one-third of Amazon forests became susceptible to fire during the 2001 ENSO period. Field measurements also suggest that the ENSO drought of 2001 reduced carbon storage by approximately 0.2 Pg relative to years without severe soil moisture deficits. RisQue is sensitive to spin-up time, rooting depth, and errors in ET estimates. Improvements in our ability to accurately model soil moisture content of Amazon forests will depend upon better understanding of forest rooting depths, which can extend to beyond 15m. RisQue provides a tool for early detection of forest fire risk. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Evapotranspiration; Fire; Hydrology; NPP; Rainforest; Soil moisture; Tropical; Water balance","drought; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; forest fire; growth rate; mortality; soil water; Amazon Basin; South America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642548307

A sulfidization front is formed by the opposing gradients of sulfide and dissolved iron. The sulfidization processes are controlled by the diffusion flux of sulfide from above and by the solid reactive iron content. Two processes of diffusion-limited pyrite formation were identified. The first process includes pyrite precipitation with the accumulation of iron sulfide precursors with the average chemical composition of FeSn (n = 1.10-1.29), including greigite. Elemental sulfur and polysulfides, formed from H2S by a reductive dissolution of Fe(III)-containing minerals, serve as intermediates to convert iron sulfides into pyrite. In the second process, a ""direct"" pyrite precipitation occurs through prolonged exposure of iron-containing minerals to dissolved sulfide. Methane-driven sulfate reduction at depth causes a progressive formation of pyrite with a δ34S of up to +15.0‰. The S-isotopic composition of FeS2 evolves due to contributions of different sulfur pools formed at different times. Steady-state model calculations for the advancement of the sulfidization front showed that the process started at the Pleistocene/Holocene transition between 6360 and 11 600 yr BP. Our study highlights the importance of anaerobic methane oxidation in generating and maintaining S-enriched layers in marine sediments and has paleoenvironmental implications. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.",,"anoxic conditions; greigite; marine sediment; paleoenvironment; Pleistocene; pyrite; sulfide; Black Sea; Eurasia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842631725

Indoor air pollution from the burning of such biomass fuels as wood and agricultural waste is associated with a higher risk of a number of respiratory problems. The effect on other health outcomes, such as fetal growth, has not yet been adequately documented. The objective of this study was to determine whether, among women who burn biomass fuels for cooking indoors, the use of ""smoky"" fires is associated with elevated hemoglobin concentration in comparison to women using ""smokeless"" stoves, that is, stoves that are designed to reduce indoor air pollution. This research was conducted as part of a series of preliminary studies to determine the feasibility and potential health benefits of a randomized stove intervention to reduce indoor air pollution from the burning of biomass fuels for cooking. Methods. A cross-sectional observational study was conducted in rural highland communities of Guatemala from March to August 1994. Venous blood samples were collected and analyzed for hemoglobin and ferritin. All the women studied burned biomass fuels and cooked indoors, and none of the women was pregnant. Eighty-nine indigenous women using smokeless stoves (designated as the not-exposed group) and 185 indigenous women from the same communities using smoky fires (the exposed group) were studied. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to investigate the relationship between exposure (smokeless stove or smoky fire) and hemoglobin concentration, with adjusting for potential confounding factors. Results. No effect of exposure (smokeless stove or smoky fire) on hemoglobin concentration was found in univariate or multivariate analyses. In routine post hoc analysis to determine whether hemoglobin elevation is observed in some particular subgroup, we found that the use of a smoky fire was associated with a 5.2 g/L elevation in hemoglobin concentration among women with low ferritin stores (P < 0.10). Conclusions. The elevation of hemoglobin concentration through exposure to indoor air pollution resulting from the burning of biomass fuels in smoky fires for cooking could have important implications for the diagnosis of anemia. However, considering the observational nature of this study, further research using more rigorous measures of exposure to carbon monoxide as well as additional measures of iron status are needed to confirm the relationships among iron status, exposure to smoke from the burning of biomass fuels indoors, and hemoglobin concentration of women living at moderately high altitude. Further study of this matter could help to assure that appropriate adjustments to anemia cutoffs are made, if warranted, and could assist in clarifying potentially negative outcomes of exposure to smoke from biomass fuels burned indoors.","Air pollution; Altitude; Anemia; Guatemala; Hemoglobins; Indoor; Iron deficiency; Risk factors","carbon monoxide; ferritin; hemoglobin; iron; air quality; hemoglobin; indoor air; iron; smoke; womens health; adult; agricultural waste; air pollution; altitude; anemia; article; biomass; clinical observation; controlled study; cooking; female; Guatemala; hemoglobin determination; human; major clinical study; multiple regression; prevalence; risk factor; smoke; wood; Central America; Guatemala [Central America]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642488287

Methods: A systematic review was undertaken of 13 birth cohort studies. Data were collected from published papers and questionnaires administered to study investigators. Results: These single cohort studies recruited children prior to their first birthday. Using an ecological model as an organizing framework, the studies were found to have contributed to knowledge about health and development in multiple domains and well beyond early childhood. Areas for increased focus included policy-relevant environmental factors such as child-care and rural/urban differences, and the influence of fathers, family factors, peers, social competence, and genetic factors. Investigators' responses indicated desires for an increased depth of data collection and stronger sampling designs. Data quality was enhanced by maintaining skilled staff and reduced by inadequate data for tracking study participants. Productivity ranged from 1 to 760 publications per study (median = 14.0). The most productive studies were those that had started before 1990, had representative samples, ongoing funding, and larger research teams. Policy impacts have included changed infant sleeping practices, reduced environmental lead emissions and regulated swimming pool safety standards. Conclusions: A suite of coordinated and nested studies could meet sampling needs and facilitate depth of inquiry. Stable, long-term funding is required to staff and maintain well-designed longitudinal studies that can address priority research areas and contribute to the development of health and social policy.","Birth cohort; Child development; Child health; Longitudinal; Review","Australia; child; child care; child development; competence; environmental factor; family; health care policy; heredity; human; longitudinal study; New Zealand; priority journal; review; rural area; safety; sleep; social interaction; swimming pool; urban area; Australia; Child; Child, Preschool; Cohort Studies; Data Collection; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Longitudinal Studies; New Zealand",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842610654

In this paper, we present a new model that more precisely simulates small-scale emission changes that can arise from, for example, implementation of traffic control measures in transportation networks. The new model, UCDrive, directly interfaces with most travel demand models and with California's regulatory emission factor model EMFAC2001/2002. The model improves the sensitivity of emission estimates to variations in vehicle speeds and uses a theoretically consistent approach to spatially disaggregating mobile emissions. To demonstrate application of the model we use the Sacramento area network to perform a comparison study. We show that regional emissions with the new model replicate regulatory inventories, which is critical for using the model for regulatory purposes. We also show that the new model's results better replicate regulatory totals than those derived with a frequently used gridded emissions inventory model. The new model should improve the ability to better simulate changes in mobile emissions from transportation projects and help to bridge the gap between gridded mobile emission inventories and regional mobile emission inventories. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The geometric limitations of these models are circumvented by applying the models locally over the emitter surface. The validity of the analytical models is compromised by the presence of surface roughness that intrinsically violates one-dimensionality. In this paper we will calculate the self-consistent potential distribution and emission current of a bumpy surface. It will be shown that, although surface roughness influences the emission function in the temperature limit, a space charge barrier causes smoothening in the current density so that a rough emitter, operated in space charge limited mode has an emission function that is very similar to a perfect planar emission function, given bumps smaller than the dimension of the space charge barrier. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

CO2 enrichment stimulated leaf- and ecosystem-level daytime CO2 uptake and increased plant community productivity; relative CO2 effects on aboveground biomass were predicted with r &lt; -0.98 (r2 &gt; 0.95) by precipitation prior to biomass harvests. The underlying mechanisms were water savings due to reduced leaf conductance under elevated CO2, allowing for more growth in this temporarily water-limited ecosystem; this effect was more important in dry years. At the plant-species level, no effects of [CO2] were found except for the subdominant sedges Carex flacca and C. caryophyllea, which responded positively to elevated CO2, mainly due to increased soil moisture. Bryophytes also responded to CO2 enrichment for the same reason. At a more aggregate level, elevated CO2 increased species evenness (but not richness). Community productivity was N-limited; legumes derived &gt;90% of their N from atmospheric N2, but did not respond to elevated CO2 because they were limited by low P availability. This ultimately also prevented larger community-level responses to elevated CO 2 because eventually extra legume N would have been transferred to non-legumes, resulting in extra biomass. Higher biomass in elevated CO 2 was attained by increasing C:N and C:P ratios; total N and P in plant biomass remained unaffected by [CO2]. N retention, legume dinitrogen fixation (both assessed with 15N), and microbial net N immobilization did not change. Based on our findings, our main conclusions are: (1) The effect of elevated CO2 is mainly indirect via effects on the hydrological cycle in this water-limited ecosystem; (2) the C cycle responds more than mineral nutrient cycles; (3) low available P ultimately limited community productivity and responses to CO2, and this limitation may not be atypical for many natural ecosystems in which N inventories often are controlled by biologically available P; and (4) that interactions with variable environmental conditions critically co-determine CO2 responses, which contrasts with greenhouse studies and emphasizes the importance of field studies in predicting long-term effects of increasing [CO2] on natural ecosystems.","15N isotopic dilution; Bromus erectus Huds.; Calcareous grassland; Carex caryophyllea; Carex flacca; CO2 enrichment and global change; CO2 x H2O interactions; Hydrology; Nitrogen and phosphorus; Nitrogen retention","aboveground biomass; calcareous grassland; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide enrichment; nutrient availability; species evenness; water availability; Bromus; Bromus erectus; Bryophyta; bryophytes; Carex; Carex caryophyllea; Carex caryophyllea; Carex flacca; Carex flacca; Cyperaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142599994

Methods and Materials: The CT data of 8 patients with PCa who underwent three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (RT) were chosen. In addition to the routine treatment planning scan, three to five additional positioning control CT scans were performed. The organs at risk and the target volumes were defined on all CT scans. Primary and boost carbon ion plans were calculated to deliver 66 Gy to the clinical target volume/planning target volume, with an additional 10 Gy to the gross tumor volume (GTV). To estimate the influence of internal organ motion on plan quality, the dose was recalculated on the basis of the control CT scans. The comparative analysis was based on the dose-volume histogram-derived physical parameters. Results: The average 90% target coverage was 99.1% for the GTV. The maximal dose to the rectum was 71.8 Gy. The average rectal mean dose was 19 Gy. The volume of the rectum receiving 70 and 68 Gy was 0.1 and 0.3 cm3. The average difference in the 90% coverage for the GTV on control CT cubes was 3.6%. The maximal rectal dose increased to 76.2 Gy. The deviation in the mean rectal dose was &lt;1 Gy on average. The rectal volume receiving 70 and 68 Gy increased to 2.5 and 3.3 cm3. Conclusion: The investigation demonstrated the feasibility of raster scanned carbon ions for PCa RT. Excellent coverage of the target volume and optimal sparing of the rectum were acquired. The combination of photon intensity-modulated RT and a carbon ion boost to the GTV is the most rational solution for the gain of clinical experience in heavy ion RT for PCa patients. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon ion therapy; Internal organ motion; Prostate cancer","Biological organs; Carbon; Computerized tomography; Dosimetry; Ions; Radiotherapy; Heavy ion therapy; Oncology; carbon; heavy ion; advanced cancer; article; calculation; clinical article; computer assisted radiotherapy; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; evaluation; feasibility study; heavy ion radiation; histogram; human; male; physical parameters; priority journal; prostate cancer; radiation dose distribution; rectum; treatment planning; tumor volume",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0346363676

Box 196, SE-221 00 Lund, Sweden","Sweden has a long-standing political commitment to the development of renewable energy, although the driving forces have changed over time. The focus has shifted from reducing dependence on oil to phasing out nuclear power, and, in the past 10 years, to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In this article we review Swedish renewable energy policy since 1975, focusing on how it has influenced the development of wind power and the use of biomass for heat and electricity production. Sweden is endowed with rich renewable energy sources. The wind and bioenergy potential alone, about 100-200 TWh and 700 PJ, respectively, each correspond to more than one-third of present primary energy use. In 2001, about 500 GWh of wind power was produced and 336 PJ of biomass for energy was used. Renewable energy policy during the 1970s and 1980s was mainly expressed as strong efforts in technology research, development and demonstration. This supply-led attempt to transform the energy system had little impact on the Swedish energy balance. Market development took off mainly during the 1990s when taxes and subsidies created favourable economic conditions for new investments and fuel-switching. This underlines the importance of creating demand-pull policies. In the case of wind, Sweden still has only about one-fifth as much installed capacity as Denmark. The relatively slow development of wind power can be ascribed to the lack of strong commitment, continuity, and a clear strategy and approach in Swedish government efforts for the establishment and expansion of wind power - a situation that has been exacerbated by relatively low electricity prices. In contrast, the use of biomass for energy increased substantially during the 1990s, specifically wood fuels for district-heating which increased from 13 PJ in 1990 to 65 PJ in 2001. A system with high carbon dioxide taxes, 28 euro/t CO2 in 1991 and 84 euro/t CO2 in 2003, for fuels for heating but no taxes on fuels for electricity production created strong incentives for fuel-switching in district-heating, albeit not for biomass-based cogeneration. The development was facilitated by existing infrastructures in the forestry and energy sectors, notably the district-heating systems. Professional actors in these sectors were able to respond constructively to changes in relative fuel prices. A quota-based renewable electricity certificates system was introduced in 2003 to replace earlier subsidy schemes. In the next few years it is expected to stimulate mainly the development of biomass-based cogeneration. © 2004 International Energy Initiative, Inc.",,"Biomass; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; District heating; Electric power generation; Energy policy; Fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Heating; Nuclear fuels; Renewable energy resources; Wind power; Wood fuels; Bioenergy potential; District heating system; Electricity production; Heat and electricity; Renewable electricity; Renewable energy policy; Renewable energy source; Technology research; Investments",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27644541292

Dundee, Dundee DD1 9SY, S., United Kingdom","NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (NQO1) is a key enzyme involved in defence against reactive forms of oxygen and inhibition of neoplasia. Under conditions of oxidative stress, expression of NQO1 is induced, and the resulting increase in oxidoreductase protein provides the cell with multiple layers of protection against environmental insults. Firstly, the catalytic activity of NQO1 is directed towards the complete reduction and detoxication of highly reactive quinones. Secondly, the oxidoreductase maintains the endogenous lipid-soluble antioxidants, α-tocopherol-hydroquinone and ubiquinol in their reduced and active forms. Thirdly, NQO1 is required for the stabilisation of p53 protein in response to DNA-damaging stimuli, and it thereby influences cell fate decisions. In view of the anticarcinogenic actions of NQO1, an understanding of the mechanisms that govern its expression is desirable. The redox sensitivity of NQO1 transcription occurs through a cis-acting antioxidant response element (ARE) located within the regulatory region of the mouse, rat and human genes. This element recruits the positively acting basic leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factor NF-E2 p45-related factor 2 (Nrf2). Under normal constitutive conditions, Nrf2 associates with the cytoskeletal-binding protein Keap1, which regulates the subcellular distribution of the bZip factor and also targets it for proteasome-dependent degradation. Oxidative stress inhibits the Nrf2-Keap1 interaction, thus promoting nuclear accumulation of the transcription factor and transactivation of NQO1 and other ARE-driven genes. Mouse, rat and human NQO1 can also be induced by planar aromatic hydrocarbons through a cis-acting xenobiotic response element (XRE) located in their gene promoters. The XRE recruits the arylhydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and AhR nuclear translocator.

The diameter of the carbon nanotubes is around 30 nm and the length is about 12-μm. The X-ray fluence enhancement in the water-window region is sevenfold compared with a conventional carbon plate target. Further enhancement can be expected by optimizing the size of the carbon nanotubes. Soft X-ray pulse duration is 26 ps. It is also found that the K α X-ray line emission from the Si substrate of the carbon nanotube target was enhanced. This result indicates that by covering various solid materials with carbon nanotubes, enhanced short Kα X-ray pulses with the corresponding wavelength can be obtained.

This paper discusses the possible impacts of these measures on the nitrogen-oxide and sulfur-dioxide emissions from manufacturing industries in Hiroshima Prefecture. Trends of emission from twenty-three types of manufacturing industries in Hiroshima Prefecture, the calculations based on fuel consumption, are presented for 20 years (1990-2010). Three scenarios were developed, related to the possible achievement of particular measures together with Nippon Keidanren (Japan Business Federation) voluntary action plan on the environment. Predictions show that nitrogen-oxide and sulfur-dioxide emissions may be decreased from 18.9 and 21.5 kton in 1990 to 15.1 and 14.2 kton in 2010, respectively if Japanese energy policy and targets in voluntary action plans are successfully implemented. If they are less successfully implemented, the annual sulfur-dioxide emission could decrease to 17.9 kton and nitrogen-oxide emission will be same with 1990s level. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

From 1944 to 1986 the government denied environmental contamination, let alone any health impact. An alliance of residents (Downwinders), physicians, scientists, and social justice activists designed, distributed, collected, and analyzed a health survey concerning persons who had been at risk for exposure to internally lodged radio-isotopes. This community-participatory health study suggests an excess of illnesses among Hanford Downwinders. These findings cast doubts on conclusions drawn from a widely publicized government study: that radioactive emissions from Hanford did not lead to increases in thyroid disease. The described collaborative grass-roots project may serve as a model for identifying health effects among other populations exposed to radioactive fallout or other environmental contaminants. Concomitantly, a community-participatory survey can provide a sense of validation and empowerment by affording affected populations valuable data in support of their demands for large-scale epidemiological studies of environmental links to their health problems, followed by remedial actions. © Taylor and Francis Inc.","Citizen-scientist cooperation; Community-participatory health survey; Downwinders; Environmental radioactivity; Hanford; Popular epidemiology; Radiation health effects; Radioactive fallout","epidemiology; health impact; health survey; radioactive pollution; Hanford; North America; United States; Washington [United States]",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142665592

The emissions of chlorinated trace organics from electric arc furnaces (EAF) have been monitored on a regular basis in Sweden since the 1980s. Most analyses have encompassed not only polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD) and dibenzofurans (PCDF), but also chlorinated benzenes and phenols. Emissions of 2,3,7,8-substituted PCDD/PCDF from municipal solid waste incinerators (MSWI) can be modelled and predicted from analyses of chlorinated benzenes and phenols, which are suspected to be precursors in the formation process. The purpose of this investigation was to extend and update previously reported models with new samples from EAF, to describe the main sources of variation and to compare multivariate calibration with univariate regression. The measurement data consisted of 27 samples collected between 1987 and 2002 and analysed by two different laboratories. A general multivariate calibration model was able to describe 96% of the variation in the toxic equivalent quantity (TEQ) value over five orders of magnitude. Univariate regression models cannot account for changes in the congener pattern and thus gave a poorer performance. In plant-specific applications, the univariate approach did, however, perform equally well. It was therefore concluded that both multivariate and univariate regression models can be used in process optimisation studies, but that multivariate models are better suited for emission monitoring and evaluation of removal efficiencies in the off-gas cleaning systems. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

At each station a municipal waste incinerator is used to dispose of putrescible waste, wood, paper, cardboard, and plastics. Incineration significantly reduces the volume of waste but this combustion also emits toxic compounds. This study examined the waste incineration stream at Casey Station, Australian Antarctic Territory. The waste stream was sorted, burnt, and the incinerator emissions monitored. Twelve chemical compounds in gaseous emissions and heavy metals in the ash were measured. Results indicate that emissions of carbon monoxide are higher than one might expect from a small incinerator, and hydrocarbon emissions from the incinerator exceed combined hydrocarbon emissions from other sources on station. Arsenic and copper concentrations in ash, which is returned to Australia for disposal, exceed limits for hazardous waste disposal and so treatment would be required. Recommendations are provided on controlling source material in order to reduce or eliminate toxic emissions and undertaking incinerator maintenance to optimise combustion.",,"emission; incineration; municipal solid waste; waste disposal; Antarctica; Casey Station; East Antarctica; Fraxinus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843079826

In this case, methane gas hydrates found on the northeast Sakhalin slope may have decomposed due to a reactivation of fault zones. Methane emissions in the Okhotsk Sea generally can be divided into two forms. Firstly, methane vents from decomposing gas hydrates and/or free gas exist below gas hydrate saturated sediments via fault zones, venting into the water column with high bubble concentrations that were recorded by echo-sounding. These hydro-acoustic anomalies were named ""flares"". Methane concentration inside these flares reached 10,000-20,000 nl/l (background methane concentrations in the Okhotsk Sea are less than 90-100 nl/l). Secondly, methane migrates as seepage into the water column from oil- and gas-bearing sedimentary source rocks on the eastern Sakhalin shelf, without showing acoustic anomalies in the water column, probably by filtration and diffusion processes. In these areas methane concentration reached 500-3,000 nl/l. In seismo-tectonically active regions, like the northwestern part of the Okhotsk Sea, many new flares were observed. Their distribution and orientation are usually controlled by fault zones (East Sakhalin Shear Zone in the Okhotsk Sea). © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"gas hydrate; gas seepage; methane; seismotectonics; structural geology; Pacific Ocean; Sea of Okhotsk",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242885774

The X- and Q-band EPR spectra have been recorded from two forms of the catalytic site of the enzyme N2OR from Paracoccus pantotrophus, namely, a form prepared anaerobically, CuZ, that undergoes a one-electron redox cycle and CuZ*, prepared aerobically, which cannot be redox cycled. The spectra of both species are axial with that of CuZ showing a rich hyperfine splitting in the g ˈ-region at X-band. DFT calculations were performed to gain insight into the electronic configuration and ground-state properties of CuZ and to calculate EPR parameters. The results for the oxidation state [Cu+13Cu+21S]3+ are in good agreement with values obtained from the fitting of experimental spectra, confirming the absolute oxidation state of CuZ. The unpaired spin density in this configuration is delocalised over four copper ions, thus, CuI 20.1%, CuII 9.5%, CuIII 4.8% and CuIV 9.2%, the µ4-sulfide ion and oxygen ligand.

We fit the soft X-ray excess with a relativistically broadened O VIII recombination spectrum, including the entire line series and recombination continuum. This plus an underlying power-law continuum provides a much better fit to the soft X-ray spectrum than a single temperature or disk blackbody plus power law. The emission-line profiles, computed for a Kerr metric around a maximally rotating black hole, reveal a sharply peaked disk emissivity law and inner radius smaller than 1.7RG. The spectrum also includes narrow absorption and emission lines from C, N, O, Ne, and Fe in an ionized outflow. Outflow column densities are relatively low and do not create significant edges in the spectrum. The small amount of absorption bolsters confidence in the detection of relativistic emission-line features. The narrow-line emitter has a large (76%) global covering fraction, leading to strong forbidden lines and filling in of the resonance absorption lines. We also find broad C VI Lyα and very broad O VII emission from the broad-line region. The narrow- and broad-line regions span large ranges in ionization parameter and may arise in a disk outflow. The ionized absorber has a large ionization range, which is inconsistent with pressure equilibrium in a multiphase medium.

However, for a country to assess emission reductions due to grassland management, there must be an inventory method for estimating the change in SOC storage. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has developed a simple carbon accounting approach for this purpose, and here we derive new grassland management factors that represent the effect of changing management on carbon storage for this method. Our literature search identified 49 studies dealing with effects of management practices that either degraded or improved conditions relative to nominally managed grasslands. On average, degradation reduced SOC storage to 95% ± 0.06 and 97% ± 0.05 of carbon stored under nominal conditions in temperate and tropical regions, respectively. In contrast, improving grasslands with a single management activity enhanced SOC storage by 14% ± 0.06 and 17% ± 0.05 in temperate and tropical regions, respectively, and with an additional improvement(s), storage increased by another 11% ± 0.04. We applied the newly derived factor coefficients to analyze C sequestration potential for managed grasslands in the U.S., and found that over a 20-year period changing management could sequester from 5 to 142 Tg C yr-1 or 0.1 to 0.9 Mg C ha-1 yr-1, depending on the level of change. This analysis provides revised factor coefficients for the IPCC method that can be used to estimate impacts of management; it also provides a methodological framework for countries to derive factor coefficients specific to conditions in their region.",,"Carbon; Climate change; Climatology; Soils; Carbon storage; Emission reductions; Grassland management; Soil organic carbon (SOC); Environmental engineering; carbon; carbon sequestration; emission control; grassland; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; soil carbon; climate change; conference paper; grassland; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; methodology; practice guideline; soil analysis; temperature dependence; tropics; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042742138

Since the mid-1990s, (he state agency for environmental protection, FEMA (Fundação Estadual do Meio Ambiente de Mato Grosso), has enforced regulations to reduce Hg emissions to air and water and has also implemented an environmental assessment program. The objectives of this study were to evaluate efforts to reduce emissions of Hg to air and water from nine improved amalgamation centers, and to assess the pollution level in sediment at 25 sites around Poconé. In spite of the fact that retorts were used, results showed large emissions of Hg when burning amalgam, resulting in Hg air concentrations above the limit for occupational air (50 μg/m 3) at all centers except one. Keeping washing water in closed systems and dumping residues in specially prepared sites reduced Hg emissions to watercourses. The average Hg concentration of fine sediments (&lt;74 μm) in the Bento Gomes river basin was 104 ng Hg/g dry weight, three to four times higher than the background level; large amounts of Hg-contaminated sediments are re-suspended during the rainy season. In conclusion, present emissions to local watercourses have been efficiently reduced, but the use of retorts in improved amalgamation centers has not adequately reduced Hg emissions to air, which is why the use of Hg remains an occupational and environmental problem. © 2004 National Association of Environmental Professionals.",,"emission control; gold mine; mercury (element); small scale mining; Brazil; Mato Grosso; Pocone; South America; Western Hemisphere; World",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11244255296

These time series were: Stockholm air temperature and magnitude of seasonal temperature cycle, Stockholm sea level data. Baltic Sea maximum ice cover, and circulation types based on regional air pressure data. The definition of climate was analysed by considering how each parameter varies with the time scale. We found that 90% of the variance was for time scales shorter than 15 yr, the period then used as the climate-averaging time for all studied parameters. The results indicate positive trends for air temperature, sea level, and frequencies of anti-cyclonic circulation and westerly wind types over the last 200 yr. Negative trends were found for the magnitude of seasonal temperature cycle, sea-ice cover, and frequency of southwesterly wind. The major climate changes of the late 19th century were probably associated with the end of the 'Little Ice Age' and characterized by an unusual high frequency of cyclonic circulation. In the 20th century, pronounced positive trends were observed in sea level variation and anti-cyclonic circulation. In the most recent studied climate period (1985-2000), air temperature and sea level climate anomalies were positive and lay outside the range of last 200 yr normal variations. The study indicates that increased frequencies of anti-cyclonic circulation and westerly winds have resulted in a slightly warmer climate with reduced seasonal amplitude and reduced ice cover. Thereby, we support the hypothesis that the long-term climate change in the Baltic Sea region is at least partly related to changes in the atmospheric circulation. © Inter-Research 2004.","Atmospheric circulation; Baltic sea; Climate; Ice and sea levels; Temperature","air temperature; atmospheric circulation; climate change; ice cover; sea level; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542377465

It was observed that, although at a given temperature a common steady-state of constant methane conversion was attained for all sulphur dioxide concentrations, the deactivation rate increased as sulphur dioxide concentration in the feed increased. On the other hand, the deactivation rate decreased as temperature increased the activity at steady state increasing as temperature increased. The behaviour of the system has been modelled considering that the methane combustion follows a pseudo-first-order with respect to methane kinetics, whereas the deactivation is caused by the formation of surface Pd sulphate, which is less active than Pd oxide. The rate of formation of Pd sulphate is considered to be first-order for both sulphur concentration and fraction of unsulphated Pd. The proposed deactivation model, in addition to being in good agreement with the deactivation mechanisms proposed in the literature for this process, provides a good fit for the experimental results for which the deactivation may be assumed to be caused by sulphur poisoning only. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The Eel River Basin (ERB), located on the continental slope off Northern California, contains active methane vents and seep-associated chemosynthetic biological communities (CBC) on the crests of anticlines in ∼ 520-m water depth. Seep-related features on the seafloor have a patchy distribution and include active bubbling vents, chemosynthetic clam beds, and sulfide-oxidizing bacterial mats. Methane sources supplying local seeps are heterogeneous on all spatial scales and support a large and diverse microbial assemblage involved in the anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM). To develop a comprehensive understanding of the complex biological, geochemical and physical processes associated with, and influencing seafloor methane seepage, a multidisciplinary approach is required.

This study investigates (1) the influence of vegetation on the local climate in the tropics; (2) how that influence varies from region to region; and (3) how the sensitivity of the local climate to vegetation, and hence land use change, depends on the hydraulic characteristics of the soil. A series of idealised experiments with the Hadley Centre atmospheric model, HadAM3, are described in which the influence of vegetation in the tropics is assessed by comparing the results of integrations with and without tropical vegetation. The sensitivity of the results to the soil characteristics is then explored by repeating the experiments with a differing, but equally valid, description of soil hydraulic parameters. The results have shown that vegetation has a significant moderating effect on the climate throughout the tropics by cooling the surface through enhanced latent heat fluxes. The influence of vegetation is, however, seasonally dependent, with much greater impacts during the dry season when the availability of surface moisture is limited. Furthermore, there are significant regional variations both in terms of the magnitude of the cooling and in the response of the precipitation. Not all regions show a feedback of vegetation on the local precipitation; this result has been related both to vegetation type and to the prevailing meteorological conditions. An important finding has been the sensitivity of the results to the specification of the soil hydraulic parameters. The introduction of more freely draining soils has changed the soil-moisture contents of the control, vegetated system and has reduced, significantly, the climate sensitivity to vegetation and by implication, land use change. Changes to the soil parameters' have also had an impact on the soil hydrology and its interaction with vegetation, by altering the partitioning between fast and slow runoff processes. These results raise important questions about the representation of highly heterogeneous soil characteristics in climate models, as well as the potential influence of land use change on the soil characteristics themselves. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"atmosphere-biosphere interaction; regional climate; soil moisture; surface temperature; vegetation cover",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544263785

However, no fundamental studies on single crystals have been related, and although the presence of surface oxides seems to be important, little is known about the mechanism. Single crystal electrodes of Au, Cu and AuCu alloys (1, 10, and 20 at.% gold) and a 50 at.% gold polycrystal alloy have been synthesized and characterized by AES and cyclic voltammetry (CV). The segregation equilibrium was studied experimentally (using the low-energy Auger peaks of Cu and Au after deconvolution) and theoretically (with classical thermodynamics and a Monte-Carlo Metropolis approach). All the alloy electrodes show a surface enrichment in gold. The electrochemical characterization reveals that the dilution of copper by gold delays the oxidation of the electrode to more positive potentials with respect to pure copper, whereas simultaneously the reduction of protons occurs at more negative potentials than pure gold. Thanks to an electrochemical-UHV transfer system, we show that the surface composition of the electrode drastically depends on the working potential.

This vertical carbon flux can be calculated by integrating the vertical profile of the seawater respiration rate but is rarely done because measuring seawater respiration is so difficult. However, seawater respiratory oxygen consumption is the product of the combined activity of all the respiratory electron transfer systems in a seawater community of bacterioplankton, phytoplankton, and zooplankton. This respiratory electron transfer system (ETS) is the membrane bound enzymatic system that controls oxygen consumption and ATP production in all eukaryots and in almost all bacteria and archaea. As such, it represents potential respiratory oxygen consumption. Exploiting this, we measured plankton-community ETS activity in water column profiles in the Gulf of Maine to give the potential-respiration of the water column. To interpret these potentials in terms of actual seawater respiration we made use of previous measurements of respiratory oxygen consumption and ETS activity in the Gulf of Maine to calculate a ratio of respiratory potential to actual respiration. Armed with this ratio we calculated seawater respiration depth profiles from the ETS activity measurements. These profiles were characterized by: (1) high oxygen consumption rates in the euphotic zone; (2) subsurface maxima near the subsurface chlorophyll maxima (SCM); (3) rapid declines associated with thermoclines; (4) low declining rates below 50 m; (5) and elevated values occasionally near the bottom. Sea surface values ranged from 229 to 489 pmol O2, min-1 L-1. Euphoric zone maximum values ranged from 457 to 682 pmol O2 min-1 L-1 while the minimum values below 70 m ranged from 10 to 27 pmol O2 min-1 L-1. A depth-normalized power function described the respiratory profiles between their maxima and minima. Integrating these respiratory oxygen consumption profiles from the respiratory maximum to the near bottom minimum, we calculated carbon flux profiles. The vertical carbon fluxes through the 30 m, 50 m, and 100 m levels were 3.09 ± 1.55, 1.76 ± 0.96, and 0.93 ± 0.68 μmol C min-1 m-2, respectively.",,"carbon flux; plankton; respiration; vertical distribution; water column; Atlantic Ocean; Gulf of Maine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942696056

This will enable it to set policy and targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in line with the Kyoto Protocol. While soil is a major carbon sink, New Zealand also has high sediment yields to the ocean, suggesting that erosion has a significant effect on soil carbon fluxes, through CO2 emission during transport of carbon in sediment, carbon burial and recovery of carbon on eroded areas. As a contribution to the national carbon budget, a mass balance approach was used to calculate soil carbon fluxes from landslide and sheetwash erosion in the Tutira catchment in the North Island of New Zealand. This soft rock hill country catchment represents the upper limit for landslide-related soil carbon losses. It contains a lake that acts as a highly efficient trap for sediment and nutrients, and has preserved a high-resolution record of storm-induced erosion. Information from previous studies of erosion and lake sedimentation was used to construct a carbon budget for the 114-year period of European pastoral farming. The budget assumes the gross transfer of carbon by geomorphological processes and does not include biogeochemical exchanges with the atmosphere. Results indicate that 0.94±0.23 Mg C ha-1 per year enter the lake (0.50±0.15 Mg C ha-1 per year from landslide erosion and 0.44±0.17 Mg C ha-1 per year from sheetwash erosion). On a national scale this equates to an anthropogenically induced loss of 2 112 000 Mg C per year from the 10% of similar terrain under pastoral land use. However, the net loss from the landscape is significantly less due to carbon recovery on eroded sites. Landslide scars have a carbon recovery rate (after oxidation) of ∼0.61 Mg C ha-1 per year. Carbon recovery on areas affected solely by sheetwash erosion was not measured, but is significantly lower. This information is being used to constrain models of erosion-related carbon fluxes developed for landslide-prone terrains, as part of the national carbon budget. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

In this paper, a limited transcriptional analysis detected differences in gdhA expression among clinical isolates. In strains expressing high levels of gdhA mRNA, two promoters, gdhA P1 and gdhA P2, initiated transcription of gdhA. In contrast, in strains expressing low mRNA levels, gdhA P2 was not active because of weak expression of gdhR, an associated regulatory gene. Gene knock-out and complementation of a gdhR-defective mutant confirmed that GdhR is a positive regulator for gdhA P2. Trans-activation of gdhA P2 was maximal in complex medium during late log-arithmic growth phase and in chemical defined medium (MCDA) when glucose (MCDA-glucose) instead of lactate (MCDA-lactate) was used as a carbon source in the presence of glutamate. gdhR knock-out mutants lost both growth phase and carbon source regulation, and exhibited a growth defect more severe in MCDA-glucose than in MCDA-lactate. DNA-protein interaction studies demonstrated that 2-oxoglutarate, a product of the catabolic reaction of the NADP-GDH and an Intermediate of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, inhibits binding of GdhR to gdhA P2.",,"glutamate dehydrogenase; messenger RNA; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate; article; bacterial meningitis; bacterium isolate; bacterium mutant; gdhA gene; gene; gene expression regulation; meningitis; Neisseria meningitidis; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis; polymerase chain reaction; priority journal; promoter region; protein purification; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria; Neisseria meningitidis; Neisseria meningitidis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12144289598

Simulated seasonal-mean daily global radiation (direct plus diffuse incident radiation on a horizontal surface) under the present climate showed overall reasonable agreement with observed patterns but with negative biases in most locations. In most of the US, the enhanced CO2 simulation (future climate) showed a trend of decreased seasonal-mean daily global radiation availability in the range of 0-20%.

Political leadership, scientific community and civil society in several nations have maintained that the democratic norms for climate governance are a prerequisite for crafting a successful climate change treaty. Principle of equal per capita emission entitlements is now emerging as the key option beyond current impasse. Although not required under the Kyoto Protocol, several developing nations are taking responsible action to mitigate climate change.

At all sites, gas exchange was under tight stomatal control during the growing season. Stomatal conductance was strongly correlated with leaf water potential (R2 = 0.82), which decreased over the growing season with decreasing soil water content (R 2 = 0.60). Ozone uptake, carbon uptake, and transpirational water loss closely followed the dynamics of stomatal conductance. Peak ozone and CO2 uptake occurred in early summer and declined progressively thereafter. As a result, periods of maximum ozone uptake did not correspond to periods of peak ozone concentration, underscoring the inappropriateness of using current metrics based on concentration (e.g., SUM0, W126 and AOT40) for assessing ozone exposure risk to plants in this climate region. Both J max (maximum CO2-saturated photosynthetic rate, limited by electron transport) and Vcmax (maximum rate of Rubisco-limited carboxylation) increased toward the middle of the growing season, then decreased in September. Intrinsic water-use efficiency rose with increasing drought stress, as expected. The ratio of Jmax to Vcmax was similar to literature values of 2.0. Nighttime respiration followed a Q 10 of 2.0, but was significantly higher at the high-ozone site. Respiration rates decreased by the end of the summer as a result of decreased metabolic activity and carbon stores.","Gas exchange; Photosynthesis; Physiology; Pollution; Ponderosa pine; Stomatal conductance; Water potential","atmospheric pollution; drought stress; gas exchange; ozone; physiological response; stomatal conductance; water relations; California; North America; Sierra Nevada [California]; United States; Pinus ponderosa; Pinus ponderosa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842458411

Combustion of methane with air is modelled using a four-step reduced mechanism in the non-premixed regime. A total of eight chemical species are integrated in time along with the fluid mechanical fields. The solution of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations is obtained numerically for moderately low Mach number. A large computational grid, with 100 million grid points, is required in order to resolve the flame. The cold flow Reynolds number is 3000. The focus of the study is to investigate the dynamics of extinction fronts in three- dimensional turbulent flows. A novel data reduction and identification algorithm was developed to postprocess the large DNS database and extract the shape of the evolving flame surface including its edges and their propagation velocity. The joint probability density function (p.d.f.) of edge velocity and scalar dissipation was obtained and the results indicate that the three-dimensional flame edges propagate with a velocity that is largely controlled by the local rate of scalar dissipation, or equivalently in terms of the local Damköhler number at the flame edge, as predicted by theory. Naturally, the effects of unsteadiness in this flow produce a broad joint p.d.f. The statistics collected also suggest that the mean value of the hydrogen radical reaction rate are very small in the turbulent regions of the flow owing to the functional form of the hydrogen radical reaction rate itself. The consequence of these results in the context of turbulent combustion modelling is discussed.

The yeast Snf1 kinase, the Mig1 DNA-binding repressor and the Mig1-interacting co-repressor complex Cyc8(Ssn6)-Tup1 are central components of this pathway. Previous experiments suggested that cytoplasmic translocation of Mig1, upon its phosphorylation by Snf1 in the nucleus, is the key regulatory step for releasing glucose repression. In this report we re-evaluate this model. We establish the coordinated repressive action of Mig1 and Cyc8-Tup1 on GAL1 transcription, but we find that Cyc8-Tup1 is not tethered by Mig1 to the promoter DNA. We demonstrate that both negative regulators occupy GAL1 continuously under either repression or activation conditions, although the majority of the Mig1 is redistributed to the cytoplasm upon activation. We show that Snf1-dependent phosphorylation of Mig1 abolishes interaction with Cyc8-Tup1, and we propose that regulation of this interaction, not the Mig1 cytoplasmic localization, is the molecular switch that controls transcriptional repression/de-repression. © 2004 European Molecular Biology Organization.","Cyc8-Tup1; Mig1; Repression","carbon; Cyc8 protein; fungal DNA; GAL1 protein; glucose; MIG1 protein; protein kinase; regulator protein; repressor protein; Snf1 protein kinase; Tup1 protein; unclassified drug; zinc finger protein; article; catabolism; cell nucleus; complex formation; controlled study; cytoplasm; eukaryote; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; protein phosphorylation; protein protein interaction; protein transport; regulatory mechanism; transcription regulation; DNA-Binding Proteins; Gene Expression Regulation, Fungal; Glucose; Nuclear Proteins; Phosphorylation; Protein-Serine-Threonine Kinases; Repressor Proteins; Saccharomyces cerevisiae Proteins; Yeasts; Eukaryota",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442486948

Their activities of NOx, reduction to N2 by CH4 over Co-FERs were examined over a fixed bed flow reactor in 02-rich condition to illustrate the distinctions of NO removal activity with respect to the ion exchange methods and cobalt loadings of the catalyst. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy was employed to analyze 2p1/2 and 2P3/2 binding energies of Co on the catalyst surface. As Co loading of Co-FERs prepared by WIE increases, Co oxide clusters begin to form due to the high possibility of Co agglomeration through the interaction of Co ions on the catalyst surface. For Co-FERs prepared by SSIE, the binding energies of Co 2p3/2 are basically unchanged in the range of the cobalt loadings prepared, revealing that Co oxide clusters have already formed in the outer region of the catalyst surface, even at the rather low loading values of Co. XANES and EXAFS techniques were also employed to confirm that the Co-FERs by SSIE even with the low loadings of Co contain a small-sized Co3O4-like phase, which may promote CH4 activation and/or the oxidation of NO to NO2, and that the Co-FERs by WIE with high Co loadings comprise a small-sized Co(OH)2-like phase, which may enhance the amount of NOx, adsorption on the surface of the catalyst. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Besides the X-ray emission from the target object, Sgr A*, diffuse X-ray emission was detected throughout most of the 17′ × 17′ field of view. With 11 Chandra observations through 2002 June, the total effective exposure reaches ∼590 ks, providing significant photon statistics on much of the detailed structure within the faint, often filamentary, diffuse X-ray emission. The true-color X-ray image and the equivalent-width images for the detected elemental species of the Galactic center region demonstrate that the diffuse X-ray features have a broad range of spatiospectral properties. Enhancements of the low ionization state Fe line emission (E ∼ 6.4 keV) to the northeast of Sgr A* can be interpreted as fluorescence within the dense interstellar medium resulting from irradiation by hard, external X-ray sources. They may also be explained by emission induced by the bombardments by high-energy particles on the ambient medium, such as may accompany unresolved supernova ejecta intruding into dense interstellar medium. The detection of molecular cloud counterparts to the 6.4 keV Fe line-emitting features indicates that these Fe line features are associated with dense Galactic center clouds and/or active star-forming regions, which strongly supports the proposed origins of the X-ray reflection and/or supernova ejecta for the Fe line emission. We detect highly ionized S and Si lines that are generally coincident with the low ionization state Fe line emission and the dense molecular clouds in the northeast of Sgr A*. These hot plasmas are then most likely produced by massive star-forming activities and/or supernova remnants in the Galactic center. In contrast, we find that highly ionized He-like Fe line emission (E ∼ 6.7 keV) is primarily distributed along the plane instead of being concentrated in the northeast of Sgr A*. The implied high temperature and the relatively uniform, but strong, alignment along the plane are consistent with the magnetic-confinement model, suggesting that this hot gas component has been reheated by the strong interstellar magnetic fields in the Galactic center to produce the observed He-like Fe line emission.","Galaxy: center; ISM: clouds; X-rays: individual (Sagittarius A East, Sagittarius A*); X-rays: ISM",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2142758077

The present investigation evaluated lung cancer mortality in two areas of the Province of La Spezia (Northern Italy) exposed to environmental pollution emitted by a coal-fired power station and other industrial sources, including a waste incinerator. Methods: In the two exposed areas, lung cancer mortality risk for the 1988-1996 calendar period was evaluated using the whole Province population as referent. The corresponding relative risks (RR) were estimated after controlling for age structure, urban/rural gradient and deprivation factors (occupation, education, home ownership, housing conditions and family structure) by a Poisson regression modeling. The geographic pattern of risk for the whole province was evaluated via the Besag, York and Mollié (BYM) bayesian model. Results: Persons living in urban areas showed the highest rates in both sexes. No statistically significant risk excess was found in the two exposed areas among males, after excluding rural and semi-rural zones from the analyses (RR = 1.03 and RR = 0.77). In contrast, a risk excess was observed for females in both exposed areas, which remained elevated and statistically significant (P <0.05) after restriction to urban/semi-urban municipalities and after controlling for deprivation factors (RR = 1.54 and RR = 2.14, respectively). Bayesian mapping confirmed the rural/urban gradient and the risk excess observed in females near the industrial sites. Conclusions: The risk observed among females is consistent with pollution measurements and with other epidemiologic findings, whereas a strong confounding from occupational exposures and smoking habit could account for the lack of an excess risk in males. However, the ecologic nature of this investigation prevented drawing a causal inference. The pollution-related risk observed in the female gender is an important clue that deserves further epidemiologic attention.","Bayesian analysis; Ecological monitoring; Environmental pollution; Lung cancer","adult; aged; air pollutant; article; Bayes theorem; cancer mortality; cancer risk; ecology; evaluation; female; gender; geographic distribution; human; incineration; industrial area; Italy; lung cancer; lung carcinogenesis; major clinical study; male; occupational exposure; Poisson distribution; pollution monitoring; risk assessment; risk factor; sex difference; smoking habit",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942616858

Nitric oxide (NO) and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from soils were measured in conventional tillage and current pasture sites to assess N and C losses. Mean daily NO emissions from tilled plots were at least twice those from the pasture. Nitric oxide emissions from the tilled sites showed a strong diurnal pattern, while those from the pasture sites did not. Mean daytime NO emissions from the tilled sites were 9.7 μg NO-N m -2 h-1, while mean nighttime emissions were 29.7 μg NO-N m-2 h-1. In the pasture sites, NO emissions were 7.6 μg NO-N m-2 h-1 during the day, and 7.7 μg NO-N m-2 h-1 at night. Surface soil temperature was a good inverse predictor (r2 = 0.75) of NO emissions from the tilled sites. Carbon dioxide emissions from the tilled sites were generally larger than CO2 emissions from the pasture sites. The mean CO2 emission rate from the tilled sites was 179 mg C m-2 h-1, while it was 123 mg C m-2 h-1 from the pasture sites. There was no distinct diurnal pattern for CO2 emissions. We found that the very high temperatures measured at the soil surface in the tillage plots, in the range of 40-45°C, reduced the rate of NO emission. The reduction in NO emissions may be because of the sensitivity of autotrophic nitrifiers to high temperatures. This study provides insights on how land-use change may alter regional NO fluxes by exposing certain microbial communities to extreme environmental conditions. Future studies of NO emissions in tropical agricultural systems where soils are bare for extend periods need to make diurnal measurements or the daily fluxes will be substantially underestimated.","Carbon dioxide emissions; Nitric oxide emissions; Nitrification; Pasture; Temperature; Tillage","diurnal variation; nitric oxide; pasture; soil emission; tillage; Brazil; Rondonia; South America; Bos taurus; Rondonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542496396

The disappearance of pure cellulose in soil was studied as a measure of plant decomposition and carbon turnover. Our objective was to understand the effect of various cellulose concentrations and plant material added to soil and collected during different seasons, on cellulase concentrations under laboratory conditions (e.g. constant soil moisture and incubation temperature). The percentage of recovery of the enzyme in the control soil and in samples amended with known amounts of cellulose powder was estimated. Several methods for estimating soil cellulase concentrations/activity are available, most based on the determination of released reducing sugars. The method used in this study is based on the cleavage of a cellulose-azure substrate by cellulase to spectrophotometrically detectable fragments. Our results showed a significant correlation (p<0.05) between cellulose concentration and cellulase levels in soil, which varied along the study period. When pure cellulose was added to the soil, cellulase was detected after 7 days of incubation, whereas when plant material was added to the soil, cellulase was detected after 14 days. The recovery of cellulase from soil was also found to be seasonally dependent. The method of cellulase determination used in this study was simple, safe and rapid. From the results presented in this study, it can be assumed that there are seasonally dependent factors that affect the existence and concentration of cellulase in soils of the arid Negev Desert, in addition to organic matter, water and temperature. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

These results contrast with previous assumptions that old-growth forest ecosystems are in carbon equilibrium. The basis for differences between conventional biomass-based carbon sequestration estimates and the biometeorologic estimates are discussed. Annual net ecosystem exchange was comparable to younger ecosystems at the same latitude, as quantified in the AmeriFlux program. Net ecosystem carbon uptake was significantly correlated with photosynthetically active radiation and air temperature, as well as soil moisture and precipitation. Optimum ecosystem photosynthesis occurred at relatively cool temperatures (5°-10°C). Understory and soil carbon exchange always represented a source of carbon to the atmosphere, with a strong seasonal cycle in source strength. Understory and soil carbon exchange showed a Q10 temperature dependence and represented a substantial portion of the ecosystem carbon budget. The period of main carbon uptake and the period of soil and ecosystem respiration are out of phase, however, and driven by different climatic boundary conditions. The period of strongest ecosystem carbon uptake coincides with the lowest observed values of soil and ecosystem respiration. Despite the substantial contribution of soil, the overall strength of the photosynthetic sink resulted in the net annual uptake. The net uptake estimates here included two correction methods, one for advection and the other for low levels of turbulence.","Biometeorology; Carbon dioxide; Carbon flux; Eddy covariance; Gross ecosystem production; Net ecosystem exchange (NEE); Old-growth forest; Wind River Canopy Crane","carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; eddy covariance; net ecosystem exchange; net ecosystem production; old-growth forest; photosynthetically active radiation; seasonal variation; North America; United States; Washington [United States]; Abies; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242785206

This study focuses on three climate projections for the 21st century based on a 'business as usual' (BAU) global emissions scenario, evaluated with respect to a control climate scenario based on static 1995 emissions. Time-varying monthly PCM temperature and precipitation changes were statistically downscaled and temporally disaggregated to produce daily forcings that drove a macroscale hydrologic simulation model of the Columbia River basin at 1/4-degree spatial resolution. For comparison with the direct statistical downscaling approach, a dynamical downscaling approach using a regional climate model (RCM) was also used to derive hydrologic model forcings for 20-year subsets from the PCM control climate (1995-2015) scenario and from the three BAU climate (2040-2060) projections. The statistically downscaled PCM scenario results were assessed for three analysis periods (denoted Periods 1-3: 2010-2039, 2040-2069, 2070-2098) in which changes in annual average temperature were +0.5, +1.3 and +2.1°C, respectively, while critical winter season precipitation changes were -3, +5 and +1 percent. For RCM, the predicted temperature change for the 2040-2060 period was +1.2°C and the average winter precipitation change was -3 percent, relative to the RCM control climate. Due to the modest changes in winter precipitation, temperature changes dominated the simulated hydrologic effects by reducing winter snow accumulation, thus shifting summer streamflow to the winter. The hydrologic changes caused increased competition for reservoir storage between firm hydropower and instream flow targets developed pursuant to the Endangered Species Act listing of Columbia River salmonids. We examined several alternative reservoir operating policies designed to mitigate reservoir system performance losses. In general, the combination of earlier reservoir refill with greater storage allocations for instream flow targets mitigated some of the negative impacts to flow, but only with significant losses in firm hydropower production (ranging from -9 percent in Period 1 to -35 percent for RCM). Simulated hydropower revenue changes were less than 5 percent for all scenarios, however, primarily due to small changes in annual runoff.",,"Hydrology; Mathematical models; Precipitation (meteorology); River basin projects; Water resources; Weather forecasting; Season precipitation; Climate change; climate change; climate modeling; downscaling; hydrological change; mitigation; resolution; streamflow; water resource; Columbia Basin; North America; Salmonidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542381338

Annual average oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission and ambient air pollution contributions have been estimated for road traffic sources. Ground level air pollution concentrations were estimated over a 1552-km2 area with a resolution of up to 20 m, using emissions estimates and the second generation ADMS-Urban Gaussian dispersion model. Road traffic emissions were split into car and motorcycles; heavy and light goods vehicles; and buses to represent domestic users; commercial users and bus companies. Car related emissions were split further in to journey lengths under 3 km; journeys between 3 and 8 km; and journeys over 8 km to represent journeys which could be either walked or cycled; journeys for which a bus can easily be used and other journeys. These source sections were chosen so that the relevant authorities could target key groups in terms of reducing air pollution. The results confirm that the areas most likely to exceed air quality objectives are typically close to main arterial routes and close to urban centres and that the major culprits of road traffic related air pollution are goods vehicles and car journeys over 8 km. The paper also discusses the implications of the results and suggests how these can be used in the assessment of actions to reduce air pollution concentrations. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

BACKGROUND: Assessing myocardial perfusion during stress is important for the diagnosis and risk stratification of patients with coronary disease. METHODS: Thirty-five patients referred for coronary angiography underwent RT-MCE and technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile (MIBI) SPECT at baseline and after 0.84 mg/kg dipyridamole. The modalities of RT-MCE and SPECT were analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. For this purpose, myocardial flow reserve was calculated from microbubble replenishment curves, and regional MIBI uptake was measured on circumferential profiles. Segments and vascular territories were categorized into five groups with increasing stenosis severity by quantitative coronary angiography. RESULTS: With dipyridamole, beta and A x beta increased in all but the highest stenosis severity group. The increase in beta and A x beta was significantly lower in territories supplied by stenotic arteries than in those supplied by arteries with <50% stenosis. Graded decreases in beta and A x beta reserves were noted with increasing stenosis severity. Using the cutoff value of 2.00 for beta reserve, quantitative RT-MCE correctly identified 97% of the territories supplied by significant stenoses and 82% of those supplied by normal arteries. In contrast, quantitative SPECT correctly identified only 71% of the territories supplied by significant stenoses and 81% of those supplied by normal arteries. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that RT-MCE, with dipyridamole, can define the presence and severity of coronary disease in a manner that compares favorably with quantitative SPECT. © 2004 by the American College of Cardiology Foundation.",,"diagnostic agent; dipyridamole; methoxy isobutyl isonitrile technetium tc 99m; radiopharmaceutical agent; vasodilator agent; adult; aged; angiocardiography; article; cardiovascular risk; clinical article; comparative study; contrast echocardiography; controlled study; coronary artery atherosclerosis; coronary artery blood flow; coronary artery disease; coronary artery obstruction; diagnostic procedure; disease severity; echocardiography; exercise test; female; heart electrophysiology; heart function test; heart muscle perfusion; human; intermethod comparison; male; methodology; pathophysiology; physiology; priority journal; quantitative analysis; real time myocardial contrast echocardiography; single photon emission computer tomography; stress",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1042264292

The model employed is the low spatial resolution (T31) paleoclimate version of the Community Climate System Model that has been developed at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) with important input from the UCAR community. In this initial discussion of the results delivered by the model for LGM, we focus upon the primary characteristics of the statistical equilibrium state of both atmosphere and ocean. Also discussed are the characteristics of the ENSO mode of internal climate variability that the model predicts to obtain under glacial conditions. Our analysis suggests that the degree of tropical cooling at LGM is approximately 4.5°C over the equatorial Pacific sector, a value that is somewhat higher than has been obtained in other recent simulations of LGM climate. We also find that the strength of the ENSO phenomenon is significantly increased at LGM relative to its expression in the modern climate system. In order to achieve a statistical equilibrium representation of LGM climate, we have been obliged to integrate the coupled system for over 2000 years, a fact that has important implications for snapshot analyses of paleoclimatic state when a coupled atmosphere-ocean model is employed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Although SO2 levels have decreased, emissions of NO x are little changed, or have increased slightly. In some regions, the molar SO4/NO3 ratio in precipitation has switched from 2/1 to near 1/1 during the past two decades. Coincidentally, pattern shifts in precipitation and temperature are evident. A number of reports suggest that forests are being affected by air pollution. Yet, the extent to which such effects occur is uncertain, despite the efforts dedicated to monitoring forests. Routine monitoring programmes provide a huge amount of data. Yet in many cases, these data do not fit the conceptual and statistical requirements for detecting status and trends of forest health, nor for cause-effect research.

To this end, direct N2O decomposition and N2O reduction with CO in the absence or presence of NO were investigated using a combination of transient pulse and steady-state techniques over steam-activated FeMFI zeolites with a similar iron content (0.6-0.7 wt% Fe) and different framework compositions (Si-Al, Si-Ga, Si-Ge, and Si). The forms of iron in the catalysts were characterized by UV/vis and HRTEM. The intrinsic reaction mechanism determines the optimal iron site distribution, which can be modulated by tuning the steaming temperature during activation. Oligonuclear iron oxo clusters in the zeolite channels are essential in direct N2O decomposition due to a faster desorption of O2 as compared to isolated ions. Such forms of active iron can be achieved at a lower steam-activation temperature over FeAlMFI and FeGaMFI (900 K) than over FeGeMFI and FeMFI (1150 K). Contrarily, zeolites with a more uniform distribution of isolated iron species lead to higher activities in N2O reduction with CO as compared to highly clustered catalysts. In this case, O-removal as CO2 is strongly accelerated vis-à-vis O2 desorption in direct N2O decomposition. The dual role of NO as a promotor in N2O decomposition and as an inhibitor in N2O reduction also supports the participation of different sites in both types of conversions. NO selectively inhibits N2O reduction over isolated iron ions, further evidencing the essential role of oligonuclear iron clusters in the NO-assisted N2O decomposition. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

SIM (selected ion monitoring) detection was used for monitoring selected chemical classes: a simplified chromatogram can be obtained giving information on the chemical composition of the complex mixture. Since only isothermal GC chromatograms are allowed by flight constraints, a time axis transformation is required to make them homogeneous: i.e., constant retention increments for CH2 additions in terms of a homologous series. The order in the linearized chromatogram can be simply singled out with a chemometric approach based on the study of the Autocovariance Function (ACVF) computed on the digitized chromatogram: the plot of the experimental autocorrelation function (EACF) shows well-shaped peaks if constant interdistances are repeated in different regions of the chromatogram. The method was applied to standard mixtures representative of planetary atmospheres - hydrocarbons, nitriles and oxygenated compounds with between 3 and 12 carbon atoms - analyzed in flight simulating conditions. The coupling of the selectivity of SIM detection with the interpretation power of the EACF procedure proves to be a powerful tool for interpreting data recovered from space missions: the chemical composition of the mixture can be identified by handling the raw SIM chromatograms.",,"carbon; hydrocarbon; nitrile; oxygen derivative; analytic method; article; atom; chemical composition; chemometric analysis; computer analysis; covariance; gas chromatography; ion monitoring; isotherm; linear system; mass spectrometry; microclimate; simulation; space; space flight; standard",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644267915

Within 7 days of this test, subjects returned fasting for determination of serotonin before and after a 75-g oral glucose meal. The serotonin response was compared between hydrogen and methane producing IBS subjects. After 2 subjects were excluded for inadequate blood samples, 18 subjects completed the study. Four of 18 subjects produced methane. The postprandial serotonin level in methane producing IBS subjects was lower than in hydrogen producers (P < 0.05). Methane producers had a reduction in serotonin after glucose. Methane producing IBS subjects have reduced postprandial serotonin.

These hydrolases contain non-catalytic carbohydrate binding modules (CBMs) that, by bringing the appended catalytic domain into intimate association with its insoluble substrate, greatly potentiate catalysis. Family 6 CBMs (CBM6) are highly unusual because they contain two distinct clefts (cleft A and cleft B) that potentially can function as binding sites. Henshaw et al. (Henshaw, J., Bolam, D. N., Pires, V. M. R., Czjzek, M., Henrissat, B., Ferreira, L. M. A., Fontes, C. M. G. A., and Gilbert, H. J. (2003) J. Biol. Chem. 279, 21552-21559) show that CmCBM6 contains two binding sites that display both similarities and differences in their ligand specificity. Here we report the crystal structure of CmCBM6 in complex with a variety of ligands that reveals the structural basis for the ligand specificity displayed by this protein. In cleft A the two faces of the terminal sugars of β-linked oligosaccharides stack against Trp-92 and Tyr-33, whereas the rest of the binding cleft is blocked by Glu-20 and Thr-23, residues that are not present in CBM6 proteins that bind to the internal regions of polysaccharides in cleft A. Cleft B is solvent-exposed and, therefore, able to bind ligands because the loop, which occludes this region in other CBM6 proteins, is much shorter and flexible (lacks a conserved proline) in CmCBM6. Subsites 2 and 3 of cleft B accommodate cellobiose (Glc-β-1,4-Glc), subsite 4 will bind only to a β-1,3-linked glucose, whereas subsite 1 can interact with either a β-1,3- or β-1,4-linked glucose. These different specificities of the subsites explain how cleft B can accommodate β-1,4-β-1,3- or β-1,3-β-1,4-linked gluco-configured ligands.",,"Carbohydrates; Catalysis; Cells; Crystal structure; Oligomers; Plants (botany); Sugars; Carbohydrate binding molecules (CBM); Catalytic domains; Ligands; Enzymes; carbohydrate binding protein; cellobiose; glucan synthase; glutamic acid; glycosidase; oligosaccharide; protein; protein cmcbm6; threonine; tryptophan; tyrosine; unclassified drug; animal cell; article; binding affinity; binding site; catalysis; Cellvibrio; crystal structure; enzyme specificity; enzyme substrate; ligand binding; nonhuman; priority journal; protein family; protein function; protein structure; synaptic transmission; Binding Sites; Carbohydrate Conformation; Carbohydrate Sequence; Cellulase; Cellvibrio; Crystallography, X-Ray; Models, Molecular; Molecular Sequence Data; Oligosaccharides; Protein Structure, Secondary; Substrate Specificity; Animalia; Cellvibrio; Cellvibrio mixtus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442709187

Jia et al., J. Catal. 2002, 210, 453). We used X-ray absorption spectroscopy to follow in situ the structural changes of the iron oxide clusters in an Fe-ZSM-5 sample, which was prepared by chemical vapor deposition of FeCl3, during different pretreatments and during N2O decomposition. Reductive pretreatment in H2 always decreased the Fe-Fe coordination number; i.e., it broke the iron oxide clusters into smaller units by removing bridging oxygen atoms. When reduction was carried out at low temperatures (673 K), this process was reversed during reoxidation by N2O. When reduction was carried out at high temperatures (873 K), the smaller fragments were stabilized by forming strong bonds to the zeolite matrix and did not agglomerate during reoxidation. An analysis of the Fe-O coordination numbers showed that temperatures above 673 K are required to dehydroxylate the iron oxide clusters. Reduction at 673 K did not significantly change the Fe-O coordination number because the oxygen remained adsorbed on the iron cluster in the form of H 2O (or as a hydroxy group). This is an important result because the degree of (de)hydroxylation of the iron oxide clusters has implications on their catalytic activity. During N2O decomposition the catalyst was in a fully oxidized state. The EXAFS spectra of the samples before and after reaction with N2O were identical, indicating that only a very small concentration of sites, which is not detectable by EXAFS, is responsible for the N2O decomposition activity.",,"Catalyst activity; Chemical bonds; Chemical vapor deposition; Coordination reactions; Iron compounds; Nitrogen oxides; Synthesis (chemical); X ray analysis; Autoreduction; Coordination number; Transient activity; X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS); Decomposition",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544276424

In a parallel reaction, a significant amount of the TiO2 is reduced to Ti 2O3. One of the striking features of these reactions is a consistent relationship between the extents of FeO and TiO2 reduction; this relationship is independent of furnace size. It was recently proposed that this relationship follows from the solidification behaviour of the slag, where the final slag composition corresponds to the minimum melting point ('eutectic groove') in the FeO-TiO2-Ti2O 3 phase system; the hypothesis is that solidification equilibrium with the freeze lining stabilizes the slag composition. If this is the case, the system of slag and freeze lining must be capable of correcting two types of disturbances: thermal and compositional. Thermal disturbances result from incorrect power input, for the feed rates of ilmenite and reductant. For example, excessive power input will tend to overheat the slag, causing the freeze lining to melt partially, establishing a new steady-state heat loss from the furnace. Compositional disturbances result from an incorrect reductant input for the given power and ilmenite input. In this work, the dynamic response of the slag and freeze lining to different inputs (flow rates of ilmenite and reductant, and power input) is modelled. The model is based on solidification equilibria, and quantified heat loss through the freeze lining. The conclusion is that the solidification equilibrium cannot constrain the composition to the eutectic groove for typical operating conditions.","Freeze lining; Hightitanium slag; Ilmenite smelting; Solidification","Carbon; Eutectics; Furnaces; Heat losses; Heat transfer; Melting; Slags; Smelting; Solidification; Stoichiometry; Thermal effects; Freeze lining; High-titanium slag; Ilmenite smelting; Thermal disturbances; Ilmenite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544325252

Simulations with the Bureau of Meteorology Research Centre climate model and the CHAmeleon Surface Model (CHASM) were used to explore the sensitivity of changes in air temperature (T), evaporation (E), precipitation (P) and soil moisture (W) over Australia resulting from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide (ΔCO2). The 1 × CO2 and the 2 × CO2 simulations of T, E, P and W were sensitive to the complexity of the SEB, even though the grand mean of these quantities was almost always insensitive to SEB complexity. Seasonal variations in T, E, P and W at 1 × CO2 and 2 × CO2 were sensitive in terms of the point-by-point temporal mean and temporal variance. The overall spatial and temporal variances of T and P were insensitive to SEB complexity, but E and W were sensitive during periods of drying. The simulated seasonal change in T, E, P and W was insensitive to the SEB, and uncertainty in SEB parameterisation does not limit the reliability of existing climate change scenarios for Australia. However, the temporal variance of E, P and W was sensitive to the SEB complexity during periods of drying. Use of temporal variances of these quantities in future impact assessments are therefore likely to be very limited until uncertainty in the representation of SEB in climate models is reduced. To simulate the climate over Australia at either 1 × CO2 or 2 × CO2, a reasonably complex representation of the SEB, including a temporally and spatially variable surface resistance and an explicit representation of canopy interception, is required. Finally, our results say nothing about the importance of the land surface in general, since our analysis is restricted to a consideration of the SEB alone. © Inter-Research 2004.","Australian climate; Climate changes; Climate modelling; Land surface complexity; Land surface models; Surface energy balance","carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; climate modeling; energy budget; land surface; Australasia; Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542347728

Samples of eight selected measurement events were divided in two groups in order to investigate differences in the chemical composition of particles originating from southwesterly (SW - developed EU countries) or from easterly directions (E - less developed eastern countries). Differences between these two groups were tested statistically by Student's t-test. Five stage cascade impactor samples show nitrate as most abundant in the accumulation mode in the SW group. EC and sulphate show the most abundant mass fractions in the E group. That can be considered as a consequence of domestic coal heating and coal-fired power plant emissions in the region of westerly Poland, northern Czech Republic and easterly Germany. Higher nitrate concentrations in the SW group can be explained by stronger NOx emissions caused by the leeward plume of the conurbation of Leipzig, as well as by the still higher traffic density in western Germany. The methane sulphonic acid (MSA) mass fraction was higher for SW air masses in accumulation mode particles, probably indicating marine origin. Succinic acid also showed higher mass fractions for the SW group. This could be caused by primary emission in automobile exhaust gases and photochemical formation during transport from SW. Indeed, during SW sampling, solar radiation intensity was higher than during E sampling. The observed differences in the particle composition are an expression of the still existing technology gradient in Europe. Future campaigns could show the development to a joint economy with smaller differences in anthropogenic emissions. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Organic compounds; Particle composition; Size segregated aerosol; Source apportionment; Statistical verification","alkane derivative; carbon; coal; ion; malonic acid; mesylic acid; nitrate; organic carbon; organic compound; oxalic acid; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; succinic acid; aerosol; atmospheric particle; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; industrial emission; organic carbon; particle size; aerosol; air pollution; air sampling; airborne particle; article; autumn; chemical composition; controlled study; electric power plant; Europe; exhaust gas; Germany; heating; marine environment; molecular weight; particle size; photochemistry; plume; Poland; research; solar radiation; statistical analysis; Student t test; technology; traffic; troposphere; Central Europe; Eurasia; Europe; Germany",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344627140

Establishing a structural basis for understanding its reversible elasticity has proven to be difficult. Complementary to structure is the important aspect of flexibility and disorder in elastin. We have used solid-state NMR methods to examine polypeptide and hydrate ordering in both elastic (hydrated) and brittle (dry) elastin fibers and conclude (i) that tightly bound waters are absent in both dry and hydrated elastin and (ii) that the backbone in the hydrated protein is highly disordered with large amplitude motions. The hydrate was studied by 2H and 17O NMR, and the polypeptide by 13C and 2H NMR. Using a two-dimensional 13C MAS method, an upper limit of S &lt; 0.1 was determined for the backbone carbonyl group order parameter in hydrated elastin. For comparison, S ∼ 0.9 in most proteins. The former result is substantiated by two additional observations: the absence of the characteristic 2H spectrum for stationary amides and ""solution-like"" 13C magic angle spinning spectra at 75 °C, at which the material retains elasticity. Comparison of the observed shifts with accepted values for α-helices, β-sheets, or random coils indicates a random coil structure at all carbons. These conclusions are discussed in the context of known thermodynamic properties of elastin and, more generally, protein folding. Because coacervation is an entropy-driven process, it is enhanced by the observed backbone disorder, which, we suggest, is the result of high proline content. This view is supported by recent studies of recombinant elastin polypeptides with systematic proline substitutions.",,"Elasticity; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Pathology; Proteins; Tissue; Backbone disorder; Elastin; Biochemistry; elastin; elastomer; alpha helix; animal tissue; article; beta sheet; cattle; circular dichroism; elasticity; entropy; nonhuman; priority journal; protein metabolism; protein purification; protein structure; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; quantitative analysis; solubilization; thermodynamics; Animals; Cattle; Chemistry, Physical; Deuterium; Elasticity; Elastin; Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; Proline; Protein Structure, Secondary; Spectrum Analysis; Thermodynamics; Water; Animalia; Bos taurus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542319866

This simply constructed device can be used to supply luminescent bacteria with constant properties for either laboratory use or the assay of environmental pollutants. Furthermore, bacteria can be deployed to make sensitive (<1nM) oxygen measurements. The culture device may be configured, alone or in combination, as a chemostat, turbidostat or a "" bioluminostat"" where bacterial bioluminescence becomes the controlling variable. Over extended periods (>1 week) it was possible to maintain steady-state luminescence within 5% of a pre-set value, although occasionally a non-bioluminescent ""mutant"" became dominant; in this case light emission was irreversibly lost. A secondary chamber provided additional flexibility and easy manipulation of the cultivated bacteria for testing. The continuous culture system is also suitable for the growth of recombinant microorganisms that either constitutively express luciferase, or do so in response to stress promoter activity. The non-standard control methodologies reported may have important research and industrial applications, for example in providing immediate process control or as an inferential method to optimize biomass: product yield ratios. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Although the schemes have many features in common, attention has been paid in recent years to the development of a single, universal classification (McKelvey, 1975). Russia, unlike many other countries, uses only one reserves classification scheme (Anon., 1983; Nemchenko et al., 1996; Stasenkov and Gutman, 1989). Interest is growing in the comparison of the Russian scheme with those used elsewhere. A number of Russian oil and gas companies (e.g. Lukoil, Yukos and Gazprom) have already introduced Western standards for reserves evaluation in order to facilitate foreign investment.

However, land managers often plan for average climate conditions and distribution, rather than the extremes that can be expected. For management purposes, the frequency, severity and distribution of drought are more important than long-term average climate conditions. The USDA Forest Service continues to address various management concerns in grasslands including streambank erosion, sedimentation and erosion rates, restoring riparian vegetation, providing improved habitat for native species, and the cumulative impact of wildlife and livestock grazing. It is important to determine whether management activities impact ecosystem integrity and sustainability. Ecological sustainability can be denned as ""the maintenance or restoration of the composition, structure, and processes of ecosystems over time and space."" One way to measure sustainability is using criteria and indicators of sustainability at local levels; an example is the Forest Service's LUCID program, which was designed to test appropriate monitoring parameters at the local level. While there is no standard ""tool kit"" for assessing ecological sustainability, a variety of useful tools are available, including the Forest Service's Soil Condition Rating Guide and modeling tools such as the Century model.",,"climate conditions; ecosystem management; ecosystem structure; grassland; restoration ecology; riparian vegetation; sustainability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-34247517419

Credible and consistent estimates will be necessary to design programs and policies to encourage management practices that increase carbon sequestration. Because a nationwide survey of soil carbon by the wide range of natural resources and management conditions of the United States is prohibitively expensive, a simulation modeling approach must be used. The National Nutrient Loss Database (NNLD) is a modeling and database system designed and built jointly by the USDA- Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) and Texas A&amp;M University to provide science-based inferences on environmental impacts from changes in agricultural management practices and programs at the regional and national level. Currently, the NNLD simulates 16 crops and covers ∼ 1.35 × 108 ha. For estimating soil carbon sequestration, the database will be populated with ∼ 1.5 × 106 field-level model runs using the EPIC (Environmental Policy Impact Calculator) model, which includes newly incorporated carbon equations consistent with those in the Century model. Each run will represent a unique situation defined by state, crop, climate, soil, irrigation type, conservation practice, tillage system, and nutrient management treatment (nutrient rate, application frequency, application timing, and manure category). Results are to be assigned to specific National Resource Inventory points (NRI) to simulate regional and national baselines. In this article we present the modeling approach and discuss the strengths and limitations.","Carbon sequestration; EPIC model; NRI; Nutrient Loss Database","Carbon; Computer simulation; Database systems; Greenhouse effect; Irrigation; Mathematical models; Natural resources; Agricultural lands; Carbon sequestration; Greenhouse gases; Soil mechanics; carbon; organic carbon; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; emission control; environmental management; nutrient loss; soil carbon; agriculture; carbon sequestration; climate; conference paper; data base; environmental impact; environmental protection; greenhouse gas; model; nonhuman; policy; simulation; soil analysis; tillage; United States; North America; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042824873

This study aimed to determine the consequence of the absence of ovarian hormones on the oxidative status of animals submitted to acute stress induced by CO2 inhalation. We also evaluated the effect of pregnanolone administration upon the oxidative status in distinct brain structures of ovariectomized (OVX) rats exposed to CO2. Female rats were divided into intact and OVX and exposed or unexposed to CO2. Oxidative status was evaluated by 2′,7′-dichlorofluorescein (DCF) assay, assessment of malondialdehyde (MDA), as an indicator of lipoperoxidation (through the thiobarbituric acid-reactive substances assay, TBARS), and the total antioxidant reactivity (TAR). Both DCF and TBARS were increased in the hypothalamus of animals submitted to OVX and stress. Nevertheless, free radical production and MDA levels were not affected in either condition alone. In the cerebral cortex, lower MDA levels were observed in OVX animals. Pregnanolone administered to rats submitted to CO2+OVX resulted in reduced MDA levels and free radicals production in hypothalamus. We suggest that ovarian hormones may protect the hypothalamus against oxidative stress, particularly when the animals are submitted to challenges. Pregnanolone may protect, at least in part, the hypothalamus of OVX rats from oxidative stress. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The emission data were collected for the two dominant species Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla) during the growing season in 1997 and 1998 using branch enclosure techniques. Samples were collected at different heights from 13 to 51m within the canopy using the Wind River Canopy Crane facility. The standard emission factor at a temperature of 30°C and the temperature coefficient for Douglas-fir is Es=0.39±0.14μgCg -1h-1 and β=0.14±0.05°C-1 and for western hemlock Es=0.95±0.17μgCg-1h -1 and β=0.06±0.02°C-1. There was considerable variability among all the emission factors due to seasonal and branch-to-branch variations. Within season emission factors appear to decline from May to September for the Douglas-fir, although there was no corresponding decrease for the western hemlock. There was no significant difference in standard emission factors (Es) or temperature coefficients as a function of sunlit versus shady growth environment (different heights) for Douglas-fir, but western hemlock emission samples collected low in the canopy showed no exponential correlation with temperature. Applying the standard emission factors from this study to a Pacific Northwest domain and comparing the modified emission inventory to the current regulatory-based emission inventory yielded a net decrease of 19% in the domain wide monoterpene emissions. The relatively small difference in biogenic emissions is slightly misleading, as the difference in standard emission rates between this study and current regulatory rates is quite significant, and they offset each other when combined in this domain. When this inventory was input into a regional photochemical air quality simulation using the MM5/CMAQ system, the reduction in biogenic emissions resulted in an insignificant decrease of O3 and a significant decrease in the secondary organic aerosol (domain wide -20%).

When addressing objective 1 with annually averaged emissions data, it appeared that the UK PAH atmospheric emissions inventory was reasonably reliable for fluorene, fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo[a]pyrene and benzo[ghi]perylene - but not so for phenanthrene. However, more detailed analysis of the seasonality in environmental processes which may influence ambient levels, showed that the directions and/or magnitudes of the predicted seasonality did not coincide with field observations. This indicates either that our understanding of the environmental fate and behaviour of PAHs is still limited, and/or that there are uncertainties in the emissions inventories. It is suggested that better quantification of PAH sources is needed. For 3- and 4-ringed compounds, this should focus on those sources which increase with temperature, such as volatilisation from soil, water, vegetation and urban surfaces, and possible microbially-mediated formation mechanisms. The study also suggests that the contributions of inefficient, diffusive combustion processes (e.g. domestic coal/wood burning) may be underestimated as a source of the toxicologically significant higher molecular weight species in the winter. It is concluded that many signatory countries to the UNECE POPs protocol (which requires them to reduce national PAH emissions to 1990 levels) will experience difficulties in demonstrating compliance, because source inventories for 1990 and contemporary situations are clearly subject to major uncertainties. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Its clinical use is limited by the presence of some undesired side effects, like as oto- and nephro toxicity, whose mechanisms of action are not understood. One of the possible CDDP toxicity mechanism seems to involve the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), that can impair morphology and function of hair cells (HC) in the organ of Corti. To test this hypothesis we evaluated the effect of CDDP treatment on RNA steady-state levels of 15,000 genes by microarray analysis, using, as a experimental model, the OC-k3 cell line, obtained from the organ of Corti of transgenic mice and constitutively expressing the large SV40 T antigen. We have found overexpression of several genes related to arachidonate mobilization including phospholipase A2, group IV and V, phospholipase A2 activating protein and lysophospholipase I and III, as well as lipoxygenation like arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase activating protein. In addition, we found significant transcription of genes regulating cell respiration, including cyt c oxidase, as well as genes involved in xenobiotic detoxification and lipid peroxidation such as cyt P450, and other oxidases including spermine oxidase and monoamine oxidase. As a whole, overexpression of the group of different genes seems to indicate that an oxidative burst could take place during cisplatin administration. We therefore searched for evidences of superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide by means of electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and flow cytometry, but failed to detect them. On the other hand, we found an increase of malondialdehyde (MDA) synthesis and protein carbonylation products, indicating the occurence of lipid peroxidative degradation. When we tested the effectiveness of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), dithiothreitol (DTT) and N-acetylcysteine (N-Ac) as cytoprotectants, all of them reduced protein carbonylation to control levels and significantly protected OC-k3 from CDDP-induced cell death, with an higher protection when using the lipophylic antioxidant BHT. The same antioxidants prevented also the onset of protein carbonylation, which extent was decreased to basal levels. These data indicate that CDDP is able to stimulate gene expression up to 12 h after the beginning of the treatment. This increase in gene transcription involves a large number of genes potentially able to increase the level of cell ROS. Consistently, cells survival is improved by cotreatment with antioxidants, in particular lipophilics. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Soil CO2 efflux assessment began immediately following fall tillage and continued for a period of about six months. Measures were also taken in the spring after imposing tillage treatments on another set of plots. Concurrent measures were also made on undisturbed plots. For fall measurements, increased CO2 efflux was related to degree of soil disturbance. Losses were similar for the chisel and undisturbed treatments and lower than the disk treatment; cumulative efflux estimates also reflected such differences. With spring tillage, CO2 losses for the undisturbed and disk treatment were similar, while the chisel treatment exhibited a slightly lower loss. Results suggest that selection offall tillage equipment that maintains surface residue and minimizes soil disturbance could help reduce CO2 loss. However, such considerations for spring tillage operations would not result in a substantial reduction in CO2 loss.","Carbon; Chisel; CO2; Disk; Flux; Tillage","Agricultural engineering; Carbon; Decision making; Sand; Soils; Soil disturbances; Tillage treatments; Carbon dioxide; autumn; carbon dioxide; soil emission; sorghum; spring (season); tillage; Alabama; North America; United States; Sorghum bicolor; Sorghum bicolor bicolor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042810106

Our goal is to test the extent to which radiatively inefficient accretion flow (RIAF) models and/or scaled-down active galactic nuclei (AGNs) models are consistent with the observed properties of NGC 3998. A power-law fit to the XMM-Newton spectra results in a power-law slope of Γ = 1.9 and 2-10 keV flux of 1.1 × 10-11 ergs cm-2 s-1, in excellent agreement with previous hard X-ray observations. The OM UV flux at 2120 Å appears to be marginally resolved, with ∼50% of the flux extended beyond 2″. The nuclear component of the 2120 Å flux is consistent with an extrapolation of the X-ray power law, although ~50% of the flux may be absorbed. The OM U flux lies significantly above the X-ray power-law extrapolation and contains a significant contribution from extragalactic emission. The upper limit for narrow Fe K emission derived from the XMM-Newton spectra is 33 eV (for Δχ2 = 2.7). The upper limit for narrow Fe K emission derived from a combined fit of the XMM-Newton and BeppoSAX spectra is 25 eV, which is one of the strictest limits to date for any AGN. This significantly rules out Fe K emission, which is expected to be observed in typical Seyfert 1 galaxies. The X-ray flux of NGC 3998 has not been observed to vary significantly (at &gt;30% level) within the X-ray observations, and only between observations at a level of ∼50%, which is also in contrast to typical Seyfert 1 galaxies. The lack of any reflection features suggests that any optically thick, geometrically thin accretion disk must be truncated, probably at a radius of order 100-300 (in Schwarzschild units). RIAF models fit the UV to X-ray spectral energy distribution of NGC 3998 reasonably well. In these models the mid-IR flux also constrains the emission from any outer thin disk component that might be present. The UV to X-ray spectral energy distribution (SED) is also consistent with a Comptonized thin disk with a very low accretion rate (M &lt; 10-5 MEdd), in which case the lack of Fe K emission may be due to an ionized accretion disk. Accretion models in general do not account for the observed radio flux of NGC 3998, and the radio flux may be due to a jet. Recent jet models may also be consistent with the nuclear fluxes of NGC 3998 in general, including the X-ray, optical/UV, and mid-IR bands. The (ground-based) near-IR to optical photometric data for the nuclear region of NGC 3998 contain large contributions from extranuclear emission. We also derive nuclear fluxes using archival Hubble Space Telescope WFPC2 data, resulting in meaningful constraints to the nuclear SED of NGC 3998 in the optical band.","Accretion, accretion disks; Galaxies: individual (NGC 3998); X-rays: galaxies",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542579370

We use data from over 250 000 re-surveyed forest plots in the eastern US to estimate emission rates for the two most important biogenic VOCs (isoprene and monoterpenes) in the 1980s and 1990s, and then compare these estimates to give a decadal change in emission rate. Over much of the region, particularly the southeast, we estimate that there were large changes in biogenic VOC emissions: half of the grid cells (1° x 1°) had decadal changes in emission rate outside the range -2.3% to + 16.8% for isoprene, and outside the range 0.2-17.1% for monoterpenes. For an average grid cell the estimated decadal change in heatwave biogenic VOC emissions (usually an increase) was three times greater than the decadal change in heatwave anthropogenic VOC emissions (usually a decrease, caused by legislation). Leaf-area increases in forests, caused by anthropogenic disturbance, were the most important process increasing biogenic VOC emissions. However, in the southeast, which had the largest estimated changes, there were substantial effects of ecological succession (which decreased monoterpene emissions and had location-specific effects on isoprene emissions), harvesting (which decreased monoterpene emissions and increased isoprene emissions) and plantation management (which increased isoprene emissions, and decreased monoterpene emissions in some states but increased monoterpene emissions in others). In any given region, changes in a very few tree species caused most of the changes in emissions: the rapid changes in the southeast were caused almost entirely by increases in sweetgum (Liquidambar styraciflua) and a few pine species. Therefore, in these regions, a more detailed ecological understanding of just a few species could greatly improve our understanding of the relationship between natural ecological processes, forest management, and biogenic VOC emissions. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Biogenic hydrocarbons; FIA (forest inventory and analysis); Forest management; Land use; Ozone precursors; Plantation forestry","biogenic emission; climate forcing; forest management; human activity; ozone; volatile organic compound; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Liquidambar; Liquidambar styraciflua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7244227947

In this one-step process, NH4 + is directly converted to N2 without the need for an organic carbon source. The approach is based on a sequential addition of two types of easily available biocatalyst to the reactor during start-up: aerobic nitrifying and anaerobic, granular methanogenic sludge. The first is added as a source of aerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AAOB), the second as a possible source of planctomycetes including anaerobic ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AnAOB). The initial nitrifying biofilm serves as a matrix for anaerobic cell incorporation. By subsequently imposing oxygen limitation, one can create an optimal environment for autotrophic N removal. In this way, N removal of about 250 mg of N L-1 d-1 was achieved after 100 d treating a synthetic NH4+-rich wastewater. By gradually imposing higher loads on the reactor, the N elimination could be increased to about 1.8 g of N L-1 d-1 at 250 d. The resulting microbial community was compared with that of the inocula using general bacterial and AAOB- and planctomycete-specific PCR primers. Subsequently, the RBC reactor was shown to treat a sludge digestor effluent under suboptimal and strongly varying conditions. The RBC biocatalyst was also submitted to complete absence of oxygen in a fixed-film bioreactor (FFBR) and proved able to remove NH 4+ with NO2- as electron acceptor (maximal 434 mg of NH4+-N (g of VSS)-1 d -1 on day 136). DGGE and real-time PCR analysis demonstrated that the RBC biofilm was dominated by members of the genus Nitrosomonas and close relatives of Kuenenia stuttgartiensis, a known AnAOB. The latter was enriched during FFBR operation, but AAOB were still present and the ratio planctomycetes/AAOB rRNA gene copies was about 4.3 after 136 d of reactor operation. Whether this relates to an active role of AAOB in the anoxic N removal process remains to be solved.",,"Addition reactions; Biocatalysts; Bioreactors; Effluent treatment; Genes; Nitrification; Nitrogen removal; Real time systems; Regression analysis; Nitrogen removal reactors; Rotating biological contactor; Wastewater treatment; ammonia; nitrogen; bioreactor; Nitrogen; Removal; anoxia; article; biofilm; bioreactor; chemical analysis; confocal laser microscopy; denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis; denitrification; effluent; fluorescence in situ hybridization; ion pair chromatography; nitrification; Nitrosomonas; nonhuman; oxidation; real time polymerase chain reaction; sludge; stoichiometry; waste water; waste water management; Bacteria (microorganisms); Candidatus Kuenenia stuttgartiensis; Kuenenia stuttgartiensis; Nitrosomonadales; Nitrosomonas; Nitrosomonas; Planctomycetes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242320115

Barrett and Gifford [1] introduced the Fourier crosstalk matrix and use it to analyze cone-beam tomography. Fourier crosstalk matrix is a powerful technique for discrete imaging systems that are close to shift invariant because it is diagonal for continuous linear shift-invariant imaging systems. However, for a system that is intrinsically shift-variant, Fourier techniques are not particularly effective. Since Fourier bases have no spatial localization property, the shift-variance of the imaging system cannot be shown by the response of individual Fourier bases; rather, it is shown in the correlation between the Fourier coefficients. This makes the analysis and optimization quite difficult. In this paper, we introduce a wavelet crosstalk matrix based on wavelet series expansions. The wavelet crosstalk matrix allows simultaneous study of the imaging system in both the frequency and spatial domains. Hence, it is well suited for shift-variant systems. We compared the wavelet crosstalk matrix with the Fourier crosstalk matrix for several simulated imaging systems, namely the interior and exterior tomography problems, a dual-planar positron emission tomograph, and a rectangular geometry positron emission tomograph. The results demonstrate the advantages of the wavelet crosstalk matrix in analyzing shift-variant imaging systems.","Fourier crosstalk matrix; Shift-variant imaging system; System evaluation; Wavelets","Computer simulation; Fourier transforms; Frequency domain analysis; Image quality; Image reconstruction; Inverse problems; Matrix algebra; Optimization; Tomography; Wavelet transforms; Fourier crosstalk matrix; Shift-variant imaging system; System evaluation; Wavelets; Imaging systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342581473

In this paper, hydrogen peroxide pretreatment and plant system was done to examine its possibility to remediate the heavy metal contaminated soil or heavy metal-organic combined contaminated soil. Heavy metal contaminated soil was collected from the heavily industrialized area, in Fuyang county, Zhejiang province, China. And heavy metal-organic combined contaminated soil was prepared from the same contaminated soil by spiking 100 μg g -1 2,4-dichlorophenol (2,4-DCP). Results showed that H 2O2 could improve the dissipation of 2,4-DCP and enhance the availability of Cu and Zn in soil. The greatly increased DOC (dissolved organic carbon) in the oxidation process was probably the main reason for the greatly increased water soluble Cu in higher pH condition. Water soluble Zn, however, easily rebound to soil components with the time being and had no positive relation with dissolved organic carbon. Planting with ryegrass influenced the behavior of pollutants in soil. It was observed that the dissipation of 2,4-DCP could be enhanced by the presence of plant roots and the availability of Cu and Zn in the planted soil was changed due to the mobilization and rebound mechanisms in the rhizosphere. Co-contamination of 2,4-DCP caused the greater availability of Cu and Zn in H2O 2 pretreatment. But with the ryegrass planting, it was easier to rebound to the less available phase in the rhizosphere. Both Cu and Zn concentration in shoots increased with the H2O2 treatment. Therefore our results suggested that H2O2 pretreatment was probably a promising way for promoting the dissipation of persistent organic pollutants and enhancing the solubility of Cu and Zn in soil. A combination of H2O2 pretreatment and suitable plant might be an efficient alternative for remedying heavy metal or heavy metal-organic contaminated soil. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

National resource planning at this scale can benefit by the development of integrated impact analysis toolboxes that allow linkage and integration of hydroclimate models, surface and groundwater hydrologic models, economic and environmental impact models and techniques for social impact assessment. Simulation models used in an assessment of climate change impacts on water resources, agriculture and environmental quality in the San Joaquin Basin of California are described in this paper as well as the challenges faced in linking the component models within an impacts assessment toolbox. Results from simulations performed with several of the tools in the impacts assessment toolbox are presented and discussed. After initially attempting model integration with the public domain, GIS-based modeling framework Modular Modeling System/Object User Interface (MMS/OUI), frustration with the framework's lack of flexibility to handle monthly timestep models prompted development of a common geodatabase to allow linkage of model input and output for the linked simulation models. A GIS-based data browser was also developed that works with both network flow models and makes calls to a model post-processor that shows model output for each selected node in each model network. This data and output browser system is flexible and can readily accommodate future changes in the model network configuration and in the model database. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX) is one of the most strongly hypoxia-inducible proteins with potential value as an intrinsic marker of hypoxia. However, intratumoral distribution of CA IX only partially overlaps with distribution of VEGF and GLUT-1 indicating that regulation of CA IX differs from the regulation of other hypoxic markers. Therefore, we analysed CA IX expression in response to hypoxia combined with other stresses, and determined the stability of CA IX protein upon reoxygenation using HeLa cells as a model. We found that both hypoxia-induced transcription and CA IX protein level are further increased by reduced glucose or bicarbonate concentrations.

The influence of important design parameters such as the washcoat thickness, solid conductivity, channel geometry, and catalyst distribution along the channel on the transient time and cumulative emissions is analyzed. An analytical light-off criterion for the case of nonuniform catalyst loading is proposed, with the help of which we can determine the nature of ignition (front-end, middle, or back-end ignition). It is found that, for the wall reaction case, nonuniform catalyst loading with two zones of catalyst with more catalyst at the inlet favors front-end ignition and reduces the transient time as well as the cumulative emissions. Though high solid conduction is better for steady-state designs, better transient and equivalent steady-state performances can be obtained for finite solid conduction by distributing the catalyst appropriately. As can be expected, washcoat diffusion has a profound influence on light-off and defines a critical value of catalyst loading below which front-end light-off does not occur. For catalyst loading exceeding this critical value, there is a maximum value of washcoat thickness (corresponding to a washcoat Thiele modulus of 0.5 at inlet fluid temperature) below which light-off is not influenced by washcoat diffusion. Increasing the washcoat thickness beyond this critical value has no effect on the transient time or cumulative emissions. There is a range of catalyst loading in which uniform distribution leads to the optimal design, while outside this range, the optimal design corresponds to having more catalyst at the front. It is also found that parallel-plate or rectangular channel geometries with high aspect ratios lead to better transient and good steady-state performances. Finally, we show that an optimally designed monolith with proper catalyst distribution, solid conductivity, channel geometry and dimensions, and washcoat can reduce cold-start emissions substantially compared to the standard case.",,"Diffusion; Ignition; Industrial emissions; Intake systems; Reaction kinetics; Catalytic monoliths; Cumulative emissions; Exothermic reactions; Washcoat diffusion; Catalyst activity; catalyst; article; catalyst; conductance; diffusion; exhaust gas; geometry; process design; reactor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543020921

Areas that violate these standards (usually large urban centers) are required to use cleaner-burning automotive fuels (oxygenated fuels or 'oxyfuels') during the winter months in some cases and year-round (reformulated gasoline) in the worst cases. Oxygenated fuels are the primary alternative fuel in use, however, cleaning-up our aggregate automobile emissions can be done through many different methods. Using a cross-section of data from the California emissions testing program this paper investigates the environmental benefits gained by the use of oxyfuels. It estimates the actual CO and HC emissions abatement due to the use of the oxyfuel. The results suggest the CO emissions reductions are lower than previously thought due to the differential impact of the fuel on different automobile vintages. Cars built since 1988 have no CO emissions benefits as a result of using oxyfuels. Oxyfuels are also found to have no systematic impact on HC emissions. The oxyfuel smog test results are then compared to emissions' improvements resulting from emissions system repairs. Increased maintenance and repairs are found to be a much more cost-effective method for lowering CO and HC emissions than oxyfuels. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

A pyridine solution of (py)2FeIII(OEPO) reacts in a matter of minutes with zinc amalgam (or with hydrazine) under an atmosphere of dioxygen-free dinitrogen to produce bright-red (py)2FeII(OEPOH) ·2py·0.33H2O, which has been isolated in crystalline form.

Treatment of a green pyridine solution of (py) 2FeIII(OEPO) with carbon monoxide reveals a slow color change to deep red over a 16 h period. Although a resonance at g = 2.006 was observed in the EPR spectrum of the sample during the reaction, the isolated product is EPR silent.

While the NIMS instrument could measure thermal emission from hot spots with T &gt; 200 K, PPR was the only Galileo instrument capable of mapping the lower temperatures of older, cooling lava flows, and the passive background. We tabulate all data taken by PPR of Io during these flybys and describe some scientific highlights revealed by the data. The data include almost complete coverage of Io at better than 250 km resolution, with extensive regional coverage at higher resolutions. We found a modest poleward drop in nighttime background temperatures and evidence of thermal inertia variations across the surface. Comparison of high spatial resolution temperature measurements with observed daytime SO2 gas pressures on Io provides evidence for local cold trapping of SO2 frost on scales smaller than the 60 km resolution of the PPR data. We also calculated the power output from several hot spots and estimated total global heat flow to be about 2.0-2.6 W m-2. The low-latitude diurnal temperature variations for the regions between obvious hot spots are well matched by a laterally-inhomogeneous thermal model with less than 1 W m-2 endogenic heat flow. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The expression pattern of the corresponding gene as well as its ortholog from Arabidopsis was analyzed and the encoded proteins were localized in the two plants. Pht2;1 expression is strongly upregulated by light in potato and Arabidopsis leaf tissue. RNA gel blot analysis, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), promoter/GUS, and protein/green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion studies, respectively, indicate that the gene is expressed in both auto- and heterotrophic tissues and its encoded protein is localized to the plastids. The similar patterns of Pht2;1 gene regulation in potato and Arabidopsis prompted us to screen publicly available gene expression data from 228 Arabidopsis oligonucleotide microarrays covering 83 different experimental conditions. Modulation of Pht2;1 transcript levels was overall moderate, except for a limited number of experimental conditions where Pht2;1 mRNA concentrations varied between 2- and 3.7-fold. Overall, these analyses suggest involvement of the Pht2;1 protein in cell wall metabolism in young, rapidly growing tissues, independent of other Pi transporters such as the high-affinity Solanum tuberosum Pi transporter 1 (StPT1). Cluster analysis allowed identification of colinear or antiparallel expression profiles of a small set of genes involved in post-translational regulation, and photosynthetic carbon metabolism. These data give clues about the possible biological function of Pht2;1 and shed light on the complex web of interactions in which Pht2;1 could play a role.","Arabidopsis thaliana; Cluster analysis; Microarray; Phosphate transporter; Plastid; Potato","DNA; Fluorescence; Genes; Metabolism; Phosphates; Proteins; RNA; Tissue culture; Gene expression analysis; Polymerase chain reaction (PCR); Plants (botany); Arabidopsis protein; hybrid protein; phosphate transporter; amino acid sequence; Arabidopsis; article; chemistry; gene; gene expression regulation; genetics; light; metabolism; molecular genetics; physiology; plant leaf; plastid; potato; transgenic plant; transport at the cellular level; upregulation; Amino Acid Sequence; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis Proteins; Biological Transport; Gene Expression Regulation, Plant; Genes, Plant; Light; Molecular Sequence Data; Phosphate Transport Proteins; Plant Leaves; Plants, Genetically Modified; Plastids; Recombinant Fusion Proteins; Solanum tuberosum; Up-Regulation; Arabidopsis; Arabidopsis thaliana; Embryophyta; Eukaryota; Solanum; Solanum tuberosum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142599344

This paper investigates the existing evidence for causes and processes of fragmentation in pastoral lands and its effects of landscapes and peoples. More conceptual work is needed on the definition of loss and fragmentation, particularly efforts to clarify fragmentation from whose (or what's) perspective. Fragmentation and loss are caused by a suite of underlying demographic, economic, institutional, technological and policy, biological and climatic factors in east Africa, with property rights as a particularly important cause. These underlying causes often originate far from rangelands and drive more local causes like expansion of cropland and settlements and construction of fences and water points. Pastoral systems first fragment in wetter rangelands or in the key resource areas (wetlands, riverine areas) in drier rangelands. Ecological effects of fragmentation range widely across animal and plant populations, nutrient cycling and soils, with strong effects on animals with large body sizes. We have little understanding of the economic consequences of fragmentation and have a strong need to focus future research on valuing ecological services that affect human well-being, to gain a better picture of the complementarities and trade-offs land managers face during the process of fragmentation.",,"Animalia",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13744252133

The global emergence of drug-resistant malarial parasites necessitates identification and characterization of novel drug targets. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is present at high levels in human red cells and in P. falciparum. Existence of at least three isozymes of the α class was demonstrated in P. falciparum and a rodent malarial parasite Plasmodium berghei. The major isozyme CA1 was purified and partially characterized from P. falciparum (PfCA1). A search of the malarial genome database yielded an open reading frame similar to the α-CAs from various organisms, including human. The primary amino acid sequence of the PfCA1 has 60% identity with a rodent parasite Plasmodium yoelii enzyme (PyCA). The single open reading frames encoded 235 and 252 amino acid proteins for PfCA1 and PyCA, respectively. The highly conserved active site residues were also found among organisms having α-CAs. The PfCA1 gene was cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. The purified recombinant PfCA1 enzyme was catalytically active. It was sensitive to acetazolamide and sulfanilamide inhibition. Kinetic properties of the recombinant PfCA1 revealed the authenticity to the wild type enzyme purified from P. falciparum in vitro culture. Furthermore, the PfCA1 inhibitors acetazolamide and sulfanilamide showed good antimalarial effect on the in vitro growth of P. falciparum.

Various combinations of volatile organic compound (VOC) and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) emission reductions were effective in lowering modeled peak 1-hr O3 concentrations. VOC emissions reductions alone had only a modest impact on modeled peak 8-hr O3 concentrations. Anthropogenic NOx emissions reductions of 46–86% of 1996 base case values were needed to reach the level of the 8-hr standard in some areas. As NOx emissions are reduced, O3 production efficiency increases, which accounts for the less than proportional response of calculated 8-hr O3 levels. Such increases in O3 production efficiency also were noted in previous modeling work for central California. O3 production in some urban core areas, such as New York City and Chicago, IL, was found to be VOC-limited. In these areas, moderate NOx emissions reductions may be accompanied by increases in peak 8-hr O3 levels. The findings help to explain differences in historical trends in 1- and 8-hr O3 levels and have serious implications for the feasibility of attaining the 8-hr O3 standard in several areas of the eastern United States. © 2004 Air &amp; Waste Management Association.",,"Computer simulation; Industrial emissions; Mathematical models; Nitrogen oxides; Photochemical reactions; Volatile organic compounds; Emission reductions; Photochemical modeling; Production efficiency; Ozone; nitrogen oxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; article; concentration (parameters); feasibility study; model; photochemistry; priority journal; United States; urban area",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9544227400

Nitrous oxide and methane, cited in the Kyoto Protocol, as well as trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) and dichlorodifluoromethane (CFC-12), cited in the Montreal Protocol, are all greenhouse gases and are implicated in the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer. The lack of national standards prompted research to determine the feasibility of preparing accurate and stable standards containing these four compounds. Development of these standards would support the measurement of these species by those in the atmospheric research community not having their own source of standards. A suite of eight primary gas standards containing methane, nitrous oxide, CFC-11, and CFC-12 in a balance of air were prepared gravimetrically to bracket the ambient atmospheric concentrations. The combined uncertainties (uc) were calculated from error propagation analysis that included the weighing data from the gravimetric preparation and other sources of error such as the purity analysis of the compounds and air matrix. The expanded uncertainties (U) for the gravimetric standards were &lt;0.5% as calculated from the equation U = kuc, where the coverage factor k is equal to 2 for a 95% confidence interval. Analyses of the suite of standards by gas chromatography with flame-ionization and electron capture detection resulted in average absolute residuals of &lt;0.25% from regression models. The NIST suite of eight gravimetric standards was used to determine the concentrations in two standards from NOAA.

These recordings exhibit frequent episodes of abrupt climate change believed to be the result of nonlinear response of the climate system to internal or external forcing, yet, neither the physical mechanisms nor the nature of the nonlinearities involved are well understood. At the orbital (104-105 years) and millennial scales, abrupt climate change appears as sudden, rapid warming events, each followed by periods of slow cooling. The sequence often forms a distinctive saw-tooth shaped time series, epitomized by the deep-sea records of the last million years and the Dansgaard-Oeschger (D/O) oscillations of the last glacial. Here I introduce a simplified mathematical model consisting of a novel arrangement of coupled nonlinear differential equations that appears to capture some important physics of climate change at Milankovitch and millennial scales, closely reproducing the saw-tooth shape of the deep-sea sediment and ice core time series, the relatively abrupt mid-Pleistocene climate switch, and the intriguing D/O oscillations. Named LODE for its use of the logistic-delayed differential equation, the model combines simplicity in the formulation (two equations, small number of adjustable parameters) and sufficient complexity in the dynamics (infinite-dimensional nonlinear delay differential equation) to accurately simulate details of climate change other simplified models cannot. Close agreement with available data suggests that the D/O oscillations are frequency modulated by the third harmonic of the precession forcing, and by the precession itself, but the entrained response is intermittent, mixed with intervals of noise, which corresponds well with the idea that the climate operates at the edge between chaos and order. LODE also predicts a persistent ∼1.5 ky oscillation that results from the frequency modulated regional climate oscillation. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Our objective was to determine the variation in denitrifying community composition and activities across three adjacent habitats: a fertilized agricultural field planted to perennial ryegrass, a naturally vegetated riparian area, and creek sediment. Using C2H2 inhibition, denitrifying enzyme and N2O-reductase activities were determined in short-term incubations of anaerobic slurries. A key gene in the denitrification pathway, N2O reductase (nosZ), served as a marker for denitrifiers. Mean denitrifying enzyme activity (DEA) was similar among habitats, ranging from 0.5 to 1.8μgNg-1 dry soilh-1. However, the ratio of N2O production, without C2H2, to DEA was substantially higher in riparian soil (0.64±0.02; mean±standard error, n=12) than in agricultural soil (0.19±0.02) or creek sediment (0.32±0.03). Mean N2O-reductase activity ranged from 0.5 to 3.2μgNg-1 dry soilh-1, with greater activity in agricultural soil than in riparian soil. Denitrifying community composition differed significantly among habitats based on nosZ terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphisms. The creek sediment community was unique. Communities in the agricultural and riparian soil were more closely related but distinct. A number of unique nosZ genotypes were detected in creek sediment. Sequences of nosZ obtained from riparian soil were closely related to nosZ from Bradyrhizobium japonicum.

Development, Washington, DC, United States","Researchers have been analyzing the costs of carbon sequestration for approximately twelve years. The purpose of this paper is to critically review the carbon sequestration cost studies of the past dozen years that have evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the forestry option. Several conclusions emerge. While carbon sequestration cost studies all contain essentially the same components they are not comparable on their face due to the inconsistent use of terms, geographic scope, assumptions, program definitions, and methods. For example, there are at least three distinct definitions for a 'ton of carbon' that in turn lead to significantly different meanings for the metric 'dollars per ton of carbon'. This difference in carbon accounting further complicates comparison of studies. After adjusting for the variation among the studies, it appears that carbon sequestration may play a substantial role in a global greenhouse gas emissions abatement program. In the cost range of 10 to 150 dollars per ton of carbon it may be possible to sequester 250 to 500 million tons per year in the United States, and globally upwards of 2,000 million tons per year, for several decades. However, there are two unresolved issues that may seriously affect the contribution of carbon sequestration to a greenhouse gas mitigation program, and they will likely have counteracting effects. First, the secondary benefits of agricultural land conversion to forests may be as great as the costs. If that is the case, then the unit costs essentially disappear, making carbon sequestration a no-regrets strategy. In the other direction, if leakage is a serious issue at both the national and international levels, as suggested by some studies, then it may occur that governments will expend billions of dollars in subsidies or other forms of incentives, with little or no net gain in carbon, forests or secondary benefits. Preliminary results suggest that market interactions in carbon sequestration program analyses require considerably more attention. This is especially true for interactions between the forest and agricultural land markets and between the wood product sink and the timber markets.",,"Carbon; Cost effectiveness; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Agricultural land conversion; Forest carbon sequestration; Climate change; afforestation; carbon sequestration; economic analysis; emission control; greenhouse gas",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842715156

Future warming is therefore likely to alter the spatial distribution of primary and secondary pelagic production, affecting ecosystem services and placing additional stress on already-depleted fish and mammal populations.",,"Climate change; Global warming; Marine applications; Plankton ecosystem; Trophic coupling; Ecosystems; climate effect; marine ecosystem; plankton; article; Atlantic Ocean; carnivore; climate change; fish; food web; greenhouse effect; herbivory; mammal; marine environment; nonhuman; pelagic zone; phytoplankton; priority journal; sea surface temperature; zooplankton; animal; climate; copepod; ecosystem; food chain; food industry; greenhouse effect; growth, development and aging; meta analysis; phytoplankton; population dynamics; temperature; zooplankton; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (Northeast); Copepoda; Mammalia; sea water; Animals; Atlantic Ocean; Climate; Copepoda; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Fishes; Food Chain; Greenhouse Effect; Meta-Analysis; Phytoplankton; Population Dynamics; Seawater; Temperature; Zooplankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644324708

A visitor survey at Rocky Mountain National Park included descriptions of hypothetical climate scenarios (depicting both weather- and resource-related variables), and questions about how respondents' visitation behavior would change contingent upon the scenarios. Survey responses are used to estimate the impact of climate change on park visitation and to test for the relative significance among climate scenarios and resource variables. A relatively small proportion of respondents indicated that their visitation behavior would change under the hypothetical climate scenarios, and the net effect on visitation is slightly positive. Both direct (weather-related) and indirect (resource-related) climate scenario variables are found to be statistically significant determinants of contingent expected changes in visitation. The results of the contingent visitation analysis are compared with the results of a regression analysis of historic visitation and climate variation for methodological assessment, and we find that they are in close agreement. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

T2L 2A7, Canada","Numerous gas and oil fields are hosted in the Baldonnel and Pardonet formations of northeastern British Columbia, Canada. The source of the hydrocarbons in these fields has not been demonstrated using organic geochemical methods. However lithologic characteristics, interpreted depositional settings, and some published organic carbon content values have led to speculation that Upper Triassic strata of northeastern British Columbia, in particular the Pardonet Formation, may include important hydrocarbon source rocks. In order to assess the hydrocarbon source rock potential of Upper Triassic strata in northeastern British Columbia, nine outcrops and seven drillcores were measured, described and sampled for geochemical analyses. Geocbemical analyses using Rock-Eval/TOC pyrolysis indicate a total organic carbon (TOC) content ranging from 0.03 to 2.08 weight percent for the Baldonnel (majority <1.0 wt %) and 0 to 4.8 weight percent for the Pardonet Formation samples. Rock-Eval Tmax data indicate that Upper Triassic strata are late mature to overmature with respect to liquid hydrocarbon generation at the studied localities. One exception is the West Burnt River outcrop location (55°20'N; 122°20'W), where the Pardonet Formation is at early peak hydrocarbon maturity (Tmax-437°C), with Hydrogen Index values from 170 to 315 mg HC/g TOC, indicating Type II (oil-prone) kerogen. However, West Burnt River TOC values (0.6 to 1.4 wt %) are not as high as those observed at other outcrop localities and in core, possibly due to lateral facies variations, or to sampling bias (i.e., these samples are from the GSC Archives, and were not collected by the authors). Geochemical data from outcrop and core suggest that the Pardonet Formation in northeastern B.C. had good to very good initial hydrocarbon potential, and has generated economically significant quantities of hydrocarbon. However, gas isotopic and gas compositional data, as well as biomarker analysis of oils and source rock extracts, are required to demonstrate whether the Pardonet, or some other, deeper unit, was the source of hydrocarbons found in Upper Triassic reservoirs in northeastern B.C. Mass balance calculations based on the geochemical data presented here for the Pardonet Formation, suggest that current initial in-place reserve estimates for Upper Triassic reservoir strata are four to five times less than expected. We speculate that some proportion of this calculated volume of hydrocarbons may have been retained within the Pardonet Formation itself, suggesting some potential as a fractured shale play. The Baldonnel Formation had only poor to fair initial hydrocarbon potential, and was not a significant hydrocarbon source.",,"Characterization; Gases; Hydrocarbons; Lithology; Oil fields; Shale; Thermal maturity; Total organic carbon (TOC); Rocks; hydrocarbon generation; petroleum hydrocarbon; source rock; thermal maturity; Triassic; British Columbia; Canada; North America; Western Hemisphere; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13844292785

Despite their acknowledged importance in ecology, most research on AMF has focused on effects on individual plant hosts, with more recent efforts aimed at the level of the plant community. Research at the ecosystem level is less prominent, but potentially very promising. Numerous human-induced disturbances (including global change and agro-ecosystem management) impinge on AMF functioning; hence study of this symbiosis from the ecosystem perspective seems timely and crucial. In this paper, I discuss four (interacting) routes via which AMF can influence ecosystem processes. These include indirect pathways (through changes in plant and soil microbial community composition), and direct pathways (effects on host physiology and resource capture, and direct mycelium effects). I use the case study of carbon cycling to illustrate the potentially pervasive influence of AMF on ecosystem processes. A limited amount of published research on AMF ecology is suited for direct integration into ecosystem studies (because of scale mismatch or ill-adaptation to the 'pools and flux' paradigm of ecosystem ecology); I finish with an assessment of the tools (experimental designs, response variables) available for studying mycorrhizae at the ecosystem scale.","Arbuscular mycorrhizae; Carbon storage; Glomalin; Microbial community; Net primary production; Plant community; Restoration; Soil; Soil aggregation","fungus; microbial community; mycorrhiza; primary production; soil aggregate; Fungi; Glomeromycota",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843095943

The study focuses on seasonal simulations over the period of the Surface Heat Budget of the Arctic Ocean project from October 1997 to September 1998. Small perturbations in the initial and/or lateral boundary conditions can make the model diverge from driving large-scale fields, and the extent to which this occurs depends on the control of the model by the lateral boundary forcing, not on the origin of the perturbation. The model response to a perturbation does not depend on the type of perturbation, and it is largely independent of the magnitude as well as of the source of the perturbation. Both small and large temperature perturbations have similar consequences for the monthly mean atmospheric patterns and the root mean square difference, but the model response depends on the season. Two regimes in the internal variability were found: (1) large variability in autumn/winter and (2) smaller variability in summer. The pronounced magnitude of internal variability must be taken into account in discussing the significance of climate change and climate sensitivity signals in Arctic RCMs. © Inter-Research 2004.","Arctic climate; Internal variability; Regional climate modeling","arctic environment; climate modeling; regional climate; seasonal variation; sensitivity analysis; Arctic; Arctic and Antarctic; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11044221056

The specific focus of the measurements was on emission levels and characteristics of ultra fine particles and the emission levels together with the emissions of gaseous pollutants for a range of operating conditions before and up to 3 months after the vehicle was converted are presented and discussed in the paper. The investigations showed that converting a petrol operating vehicle to CNG has the potential of reducing some of the emissions and thus risks, while it does not appear to have an impact on others. In particular there was no statistically significant change in the emission of particles for the vehicle operating on petrol, before the conversion, compared to the emissions for the vehicle operating on CNG, after the conversion. There was a significant lowering of emissions of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and formaldehyde when the vehicle was operated on CNG, and a reduction of global warming potential was also observed when the vehicle was run on CNG, but the later gain is only at high vehicle speeds/loads, and would thus have to be considered in view of traffic and transport models for the region (in these models vehicle speed is an important parameter). © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Independently varying a single local control within geologically constrained limits produces marked differences in three-dimensional morphology, cross-sectional stratal geometry, and delta evolution during a cycle of sea-level change. Sediment supply strongly influences not only the timing of transgressive and maximum flooding surface development during sea-level rise, and hence the diachroneity of lowstand, transgressive, and highstand systems tracts, but also the timing of onset of fluvial incision and the characteristics of incised valleys and forced regressive wedges. Low sediment supply leads to early drowning of forced regressive and lowstand prograding wedges, high-magnitude transgressions, and the late development of maximum flooding surfaces. During relative sea-level fall, low sediment supply results in early initiation of fluvial incision and development of few, but major incised valleys that route sediment to elongate forced regressive lobes at their mouths. In contrast, high sediment supply leads to early onset of normal regression and late transgression during relative sea-level rise, and numerous, poorly developed incised channels and a broad, laterally continuous forced regressive apron during relative sea-level fall. On basin margins with a shelf-slope morphology, base-of-slope deepwater deposits may occur at times of sea-level highstand due to sediment bypass across the slope. During relative sea-level fall fluvial incision is enhanced by the relatively steep gradient of the slope, leading to the early onset of incision and rapid headward propagation. As a result, major, deep incised valleys develop that capture sediment and feed it directly to thick shelf-edge forced regressive and lowstand prograding wedges. The greater water depth ahead of the shelf edge and the steep slope gradients result in limited forced and normal regression compared to a ramp setting. In contrast to other controls, tectonic subsidence (or uplift) leads to modification of accommodation, so that relative sea-level change may vary significantly along a basin margin. In high-subsidence settings, relative sea level may continue to rise even at times of high rates of background sea-level fall. In such settings, deltas lack incised valleys, forced regressive delta lobes, and prominent sequence boundaries. Furthermore, normal regression and even transgression in high-subsidence locations can be contemporaneous with forced regression and incised-valley development in adjacent lower-subsidence locations. The results of this sensitivity analysis suggest that systems tracts and their bounding surfaces are likely diachronous along many basin margins and may locally be absent. More than one control can produce a similar stratigraphic response, making interpretation of controlling processes from the stratigraphic product equivocal. The models provide a framework for understanding the stratigraphy of natural basin fills, but further research on the interplay between the controls is required in order to understand the climatic, tectonic, and sea-level signals concealed in the stratigraphic record. © 2004, SEPM (Society for Sedimentary Geology).",,"Deposition; Floods; Landforms; Morphology; Numerical models; Sediments; Sensitivity analysis; Stratigraphy; Subsidence; Tectonics; Depositional sequences; Highstand systems tract; Maximum flooding surfaces; Relative sea level rise; Relative sea-level changes; Stratigraphic records; Three dimensional morphology; Three-dimensional numerical modeling; Sea level; delta; depositional sequence; numerical model; sea level change; sediment yield; subsidence; transgression-regression cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2142826576

Science, Monash University, Clayton, Vic. 3168, Australia","This study presents a factorial experimental strategy for assessing the effects of the changing land surface on early Holocene (∼11 ka) climate in Beringia. The strategy uses a coupled land-atmosphere single column model in a series of perturbation experiments that vary the vegetation type, lake cover, and soil specification simultaneously. Two sites and eight years of model forcing are chosen to determine the importance of differing terrestrial histories, local climate, and interannual variability. Eastern Beringia is represented by Fairbanks, Alaska, and western Beringia is represented by Elikchan Lake, Siberia. Evaluations of model response are performed using metrics important for vegetation growth, such as growing degree days and moisture availability. For both sites, large-scale interannual variability has a greater impact on the local climate than changes in the land surface specification for temperature-based responses, but not for moisture availability. Of the three land surface parameters tested, vegetation type is most influential. Vegetation transitions from tundra to boreal forest leads to increased precipitation, winter snow depth, and low cloud, leading to a delayed snowmelt in forested regions. This is in contrast to expectations based on albedo arguments alone. In western Beringia, a positive feedback is suggested in warming due to the presence of boreal forest, consistent with some observations that Siberian deciduous forest persisted longer than Alaskan deciduous forest in the context of large-scale cooling of the climate. The reverse was found to be true in eastern Beringia, where deciduous forests exhibited a cooling effect due to increases in albedo. The response to soil variations was relatively small, but the inclusion of inland lakes tends in general to cool the surface, although in some years a warning is evident due to the surface energy balance shifting in favor of downwelling longwave heating over evaporative cooling.

Bacterial biomass was highest in the anoxic monimolimnia of the meromictic lakes, reaching 191 μg C l-1 in Lake Fryxell. Photosynthetic nanoflagellates dominated phytoplankton in the five lakes studied. Highest chlorophyll a concentrations were recorded at the chemocline of Lake Fryxell (21 μg chl a l-1). Heterotrophic nanoflagellate concentrations were low, ranging from 2 cells ml-1 in Hoare to 237 cells ml-1 in Bonney.

We compared vegetation and soils of 14 hydrocarbon-contaminated plots in southern Saskatchewan to those of nearby uncontaminated plots to determine the impact on plant communities and soil properties. Contaminated plots had less vegetation and litter cover than uncontaminated plots, and significantly higher soil carbon to nitrogen ratios, pH, and hydrocarbon concentration, and lower nitrogen and phosphorus. Although species richness was not significantly different, Shannon's diversity was lower on contaminated plots. Mean compositional similarity of the plots, measured using Jaccard's index, was only 31%, and cover similarity, measured using Spatz's index, was only 22%. Vegetation composition differences occurred because mycorrhizal, woody and vegetatively reproducing species, and species using birds or unassisted means for seed dispersal were significantly less common on contaminated than uncontaminated plots. Self-pollinated species were significantly more common on contaminated plots. The most abundant species on contaminated soils were the annual forb Kochia scoparia and the native perennial grasses Hordeum jubatum, Distichlis stricta, Agropyron smithii, Agropyron trachycaulum, and Poa canbyi. This research shows that some plant species and functional groups are tolerant of the altered soil conditions at hydrocarbon-contaminated sites.","Functional groups; Oil spills; Phytoremediation; Reclamation; Succession; Vegetation recovery","Concentration (process); Contamination; Soil pollution; Vegetation; Functional groups; Natural revegetation; Plants (botany); contaminated land; hydrocarbon; land reclamation; phytoremediation; revegetation; soil pollution; Canada; North America; Saskatchewan; Agropyron; Aves; Bassia scoparia; Distichlis spicata; Elymus trachycaulus trachycaulus; Hordeum; Hordeum jubatum; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Kochia; Pascopyrum smithii; Poa; Poa secunda; Poaceae; Scoparia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842735085

As part of the feasibility study, quantitative assessments of indoor air pollution in non-electrified and electrified dwellings were performed. Concurrent measurements were made of levels of respirable particulate matter (RSP-stationary), and carbon monoxide (CO) (personal on children &lt; 18 months), as well as a stationary co-located with RSP) over a 24-h period in 52 un-electrified and 53 electrified dwellings. The proportion of dwellings with a detectable 24-h concentration of RSP was significantly higher in un-electrified (48.1%) than electrified dwellings (24.5%) (χ2 = 6.30 on 1 d.f., P = 0.012). In addition a Kruskal-Wallis test (adjusted for ties) showed that the distribution of RSP differed between un-electrified and electrified areas (Kruskal-Wallis χ2 = 8.20 on 1 d.f., P = 0.014). In those dwellings where some RSP was detected, the amount was on average higher in the un-electrified areas (mean 162 μg/m3, median 107 μg/m3) than in the electrified areas (mean 77 μg/m 3, median 37.5 μg/m3). Stationary (kitchen CO) levels in un-electrified dwellings ranged from 0.36 to 20.95 p.p.m. However, in electrified dwellings, kitchen levels ranged from 0 to 11.8 p.p.m. When mean concentrations of CO were compared between electrified and un-electrified dwellings using a two-sample t-test (on log-transformed data), there was overwhelming evidence (P = 0.0004) that the mean level of log (CO) in the kitchen was higher in the un-electrified areas (1.25 vs. 0.69) and also overwhelming evidence (P &lt; 0.0001) that the mean level of log (CO) on the child was higher in the un-electrified areas (0.83 vs. 0.34). Of importance in terms of both policy and for a potential future large-scale study, is that measurable significant differences in indoor pollutants between electrified and un-electrified dwellings during summer were found in spite of only partial transition to electricity use for cooking in electrified villages. © Indoor Air (2004).","Biomass fuels; Carbon monoxide; Developing countries; Electrification; Lower respiratory infections; Respirable particulate matter","carbon monoxide; air quality; ambient air; article; electricity; feasibility study; household; indoor air pollution; Kruskal Wallis test; lower respiratory tract infection; particulate matter; South Africa; statistical significance; Student t test; Air Pollution, Indoor; Carbon Monoxide; Child; Child Welfare; Cookery; Electricity; Environmental Monitoring; Feasibility Studies; Humans; Particle Size; Public Policy; Rural Population; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442545147

While critical for successful wildland fire management, there are no standard methods for creating these maps, and spatial data representing these important characteristics of wildland fire are lacking in many areas. We present an integrated approach for mapping fuels and fire regimes using extensive field sampling, remote sensing, ecosystem simulation, and biophysical gradient modeling to create predictive landscape maps of fuels and fire regimes. A main objective was to develop a standardized, repeatable system for creating these maps using spatial data describing important landscape gradients along with straightforward statistical methods. We developed a hierarchical approach to stratifying field sampling to ensure that samples represented variability in a wide variety of ecosystem processes. We used existing and derived spatial layers to develop a modeling database within a Geographic Information System that included 38 mapped variables describing gradients of physiography, spectral characteristics, weather, and biogeochemical cycles for a 5830-km 2 study area in northwestern Montana. Using general linear models, discriminant analysis, classification and regression trees, and logistic regression, we created maps of fuel load, fuel model, fire interval, and fire severity based on spatial predictive variables and response variables measured in the field. Independently evaluated accuracies ranged from 51 to 80%. Direct gradient modeling improved map accuracy significantly compared to maps based solely on indirect gradients. By focusing efforts on direct as opposed to indirect gradient modeling, our approach is easily adaptable to mapping potential future conditions under a range of possible management actions or climate scenarios. Our methods are an example of a standard yet flexible approach for mapping fuels and fire regimes over broad areas and at multiple scales. The resulting maps provide fine-grained, broad-scale information to spatially assess both ecosystem integrity and the hazards and risks of wildland fire when making decisions about how best to restore forests of the western United States to within historical ranges and variability.","Ecosystem simulation; Fire ecology; Fire regimes; Fuels; Geographic information systems; Gradient modeling; Predictive mapping; Remote sensing","ecosystem management; fuel; GIS; mapping; modeling; remote sensing; wildfire",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242298844

This efficiency is the optimum, which is possible for a cycle pressure ratio of about 4-1. The cycle airflow is function of the power requirement. To increase the efficiency, in view to reduce the CO2 emission, it is mandatory to develop a more efficient thermodynamic cycle. Different thermodynamic cycles were examined and the final choice was made for an Intercooled, Recuperated cycle. The advantage of this cycle, for the same final electrical efficiency of about 35%, is the smaller cycle airflow, which is the most dimensional parameter for the important components as the heat exchanger recuperator and the combustion chamber. In parallel with the thermodynamic cycle it is necessary to develop the High Speed Alternator technology, integrated on the same shaft that the gas turbine rotating components, to achieve the constant efficiency at part loads, from 50% up to 100%, by the capacity to adjust the engine speed at the required load. To satisfy the stringent requirement in pollutant emissions of NOx and CO, the catalytic combustion system is the most efficient and this advance technology has to be proven. The major constraints for the small gas turbine technology development are the production cost and the maintenance cost of the unit. In the power range of 0-500 kW the gas turbine technology is in competition with small reciprocating engines, which are produced in large quantity for automotive industry, at a very low production cost. © 2004 European Communities, 2004.

For these, the reader is referred in the footnotes to guidebooks authored by the Environmental Protection Agency, and other government and non-government organizations, as well as action plans authored by enlightened political jurisdictions and other general professional literature. In this paper, the definition of mitigation is used in its broadest sense to include sequestration, which captures GHGs from the atmosphere or from economic processes in a manner that neutralizes their potential harm. In addition, several aspects of adaptation, or coping with consequences of climate change after the fact, are presented.

This paper analyzes the interregional impacts of alternative allocations of carbon dioxide emission permits within the U.S. The analysis is performed with the aid of a nonlinear programming model for ten EPA Regions and for six alternative permit distribution formulas. The reason that various alternatives need to be considered is that there is no universal consensus on the best definition of equity. Advance knowledge of absolute and relative regional economic impacts provides policy-makers with a stronger basis for making the choice. The analysis yields several useful results. First, the simulations indicate that no matter how permits are allocated, this policy instrument can substantially reduce the cost of GHG mitigation for the U.S. in comparison to a system of fixed quotas for each of its regions. Interestingly, the welfare impacts of several of the allocation formulas differ only slightly despite the large differences in their philosophical underpinnings. Also, the results for some equity criteria differ greatly from their application in the international domain. For example, the Egalitarian (per capita) criterion results in the relatively greatest cost burden being incurred by one of the regions of the U.S. with the lowest per capita income.","climate policy; interregional equity; tradeable emission permits","economic instrument; emission control; emissions trading; greenhouse gas; mitigation; North America; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444370583

It reports on methods of linking climate change scenarios with hydrologic, agricultural, and planning models to study water availability for agriculture under changing climate conditions, to estimate changes in ecosystem services, and to evaluate adaptation strategies for the water resources and agriculture sectors. The models are applied to major agricultural regions in Argentina, Brazil, China, Hungary, Romania, and the US, using projections of climate change, agricultural production, population, technology, and GDP growth. For most of the relatively water-rich areas studied, there appears to be sufficient water for agriculture given the climate change scenarios tested. Northeastern China suffers from the greatest lack of water availability for agriculture and ecosystem services both in the present and in the climate change projections. Projected runoff in the Danube Basin does not change substantially, although climate change causes shifts in environmental stresses within the region. Northern Argentina's occasional problems in water supply for agriculture under the current climate may be exacerbated and may require investments to relieve future tributary stress. In Southeastern Brazil, future water supply for agriculture appears to be plentiful. Water supply in most of the US Cornbelt is projected to increase in most climate change scenarios, but there is concern for tractability in the spring and water-logging in the summer. Adaptation tests imply that only the Brazil case study area can readily accommodate an expansion of irrigated land under climate change, while the other three areas would suffer decreases in system reliability if irrigation areas were to be expanded. Cultivars are available for agricultural adaptation to the projected changes, but their demand for water may be higher than currently adapted varieties. Thus, even in these relatively water-rich areas, changes in water demand due to climate change effects on agriculture and increased demand from urban growth will require timely improvements in crop cultivars, irrigation and drainage technology, and water management.","Adaptation; Agriculture; Climate; Climate change; Irrigation; Water demand; Water supply","agricultural production; climate change; irrigation; water demand; water resource; water supply",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844261261

Progenitor cells express chromogranin-A and neural cell adhesion molecule, parathyroid hormone-related peptide, S-100 protein, neurotrophins, and neurotrophin receptors, while hepatic stellate cells express synaptophysin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, neural cell adhesion molecule, nestin, neurotrophins, and their receptors. This phenotype suggests that these cell types form a neuroendocrine compartment of the liver, which could be under the control of the central nervous system. We recently showed that the parasympathetic nervous system promotes progenitor cell expansion after liver injury, since selective vagotomy reduces the number of progenitor cells after chemical injury in the rat. Similarly, after transplantation, which surgically denervates the liver, human livers that develop hepatitis have fewer progenitor cells than native, fully innervated livers with similar degrees of liver injury. There is also accumulating experimental evidence linking the autonomic system, in particular the sympathetic nervous system (SNS), with the pathogenesis of cirrhosis and its complications. Recently, it has been shown that hepatic stellate cells themselves respond to neurotransmitters. Moreover, inhibition of the SNS reduced fibrosis in carbon tetrachloride-induced liver injury. In view of the denervated state of transplanted livers, it is very important to unravel the neural control mechanisms of regeneration and fibrogenesis. Moreover, since there is a shortage of donor organs, a better understanding of the mechanisms of regeneration could have therapeutic possibilities, which could even obviate the need for orthotopic liver transplantation. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Hepatic stellate cell; Liver progenitor cell; Myofibroblast; Neuroendocrine; Sympathetic nervous system","alpha crystallin; alpha fetoprotein; basic fibroblast growth factor receptor; brain derived growth factor; carbon tetrachloride; cholinesterase; chromogranin A; collagen type 4; cytokeratin; cytokeratin 7; desmin; fibronectin; glial fibrillary acidic protein; muscarinic receptor; nerve cell adhesion molecule; nestin; neuron specific enolase; neurotransmitter; neurotrophin; neurotrophin receptor; oxidopamine; parathyroid hormone related protein; perlecan; protein S 100; scatter factor; stem cell factor; synaptophysin; tenascin; unindexed drug; vimentin; adoptive immunotherapy; adrenergic system; bile duct; binding site; cell differentiation; cholinergic system; differentiation; extracellular matrix; human; immunohistochemistry; liver; liver transplantation; myofibroblast; neuroendocrine system; nonhuman; phenotype; priority journal; rat; regulatory mechanism; review; stellate cell; stem cell; vagotomy; Autonomic Nervous System; Hepatocytes; Humans; Liver; Liver Regeneration; Models, Neurological; Neurosecretory Systems; Neurotransmitter Agents; Stem Cells; Synaptophysin",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4944240466

We examined the influence of plant litterfall on annual variation of soil microbial biomass in control and litter-excluded plots in a tropical wet forest of Puerto Rico. We also measured soil moisture, soil temperature, and plant litterfall in these treatment plots. Aboveground plant litter input had no effect on soil microbial biomass or on its pattern of fluctuation. Monthly changes in soil microbial biomass were not synchronized with aboveground litter inputs, but rather preceeded litterfall by one month. Soil microbial biomass did not correlate with soil temperature, moisture, or rainfall. Our results suggest that changes in soil microbial biomass are not directly regulated by soil temperature, moisture, or aboveground litter input at local scales within a tropical wet forest, and there were asynchronous fluctuation between soil microbial biomass and plant litterfall. Potential mechanisms for this asynchronous fluctuation include soil microbial biomass regulation by competition for soil nutrients between microorganisms and plants, and regulation by below-ground carbon inputs associated with the annual solar and drying-rewetting cycles in tropical wet forests.","annual fluctuation; drying-rewetting cycles; litterfall; microbial biomass; plant-microbial competition; tropical wet forest","biomass; litterfall; microbial activity; soil organic matter; tropical forest; Atlantic islands; Atlantic Ocean; Caribbean Islands; Greater Antilles; Puerto Rico",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043148811

Spatial confinement of two-photon excitation gives rise to several advantages over single-photon confocal microscopy. First, penetration depth of the excitation beam is increased. Second, because out-of-focus fluorescence is never generated, no pinhole is necessary in the detection path of the microscope, resulting in increased fluorescence collection efficiency. Third, two-photon excitation markedly reduces overall photobleaching and photodamage, resulting in extended viability of biological specimens during long-term imaging. Finally, localized excitation can be used for photolysis of caged compounds in femtoliter volumes and for diffusion measurements by two-photon fluorescence photobleaching recovery. This review aims to provide an overview of the use of two-photon excitation microscopy. Selected applications of this technique will illustrate its excellent suitability to assess cellular and subcellular events in intact, strongly scattering tissue. In particular, its capability to resolve differences in calcium dynamics between individual cardiomyocytes deep within intact, buffer-perfused hearts is demonstrated. Potential applications of two-photon laser scanning microscopy as applied to integrative cardiac physiology are pointed out.","Calcium imaging; Laser scanning microscopy; Two-photon excitation","calcium; bleaching; comparative study; confocal microscopy; excitation; fluorescence microscopy; heart muscle cell; human; laser microscopy; light damage; mathematical analysis; oxidation reduction reaction; photolysis; priority journal; review; Animals; Calcium; Equipment Design; Fibroblasts; Fluorescent Dyes; Forecasting; Gap Junctions; Humans; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Microscopy, Confocal; Microscopy, Fluorescence, Multiphoton; Myocardium; Myocytes, Cardiac; Optics; Oxidation-Reduction; Photobleaching; Photolysis; Photons",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10644237946

Therefore four microcosm 15N tracer experiments were performed to evaluate the effect of common wetland plants (Phalaris arundinacea, Phragmites australis) combined with different soil moisture conditions (from dry to reflooded) on nitrate turnover processes. At the end of experiment, the total formation of gaseous N compounds was calculated using the 15N balance method. In two experiments (wet and reflooded soil conditions) the N2O and N2 emissions were also directly determined. Our results show that in degraded fen soils, which process mainly takes place - denitrification or transformation into organic N compounds - is determined by the soil moisture conditions. Under dry soil moisture conditions (water filled pore space: 31%) up to 80% of the 15N nitrate added was transformed into organic N compounds. This transformation process is not affected by plant growth. Under reflooded conditions (water filled pore space: 100%), the total gaseous N losses were highest (77-95% of the 15N-nitrate added) and the transformation into organic N compounds was very low (1.8% of 15N nitrate added). Under almost all soil conditions plant growth reduced the N losses by 20-25% of the 15N nitrate added due to plant uptake. The N2 emissions exceeded the N2O emissions by a factor of 10-20 in planted soil, and as much as 30 in unplanted soil. In the treatments planted with Phragmites australis, N2O emission was about two times higher than in the corresponding unplanted treatment. 15% of the N2O and N2 formed was transported via the Phragmites shoots from the soil into the atmosphere. By contrast, Phalaris arundinacea did not affect N2O emissions and no emission via the shoots was observed. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

This study is based on the principle that carpet-forming bryophytes (pleurocarpic mosses) absorb elements and particles from rain, melting snow and dry deposition. We compare the concentrations of 60 elements in carpets of the forest moss Pleurozium schreberi sampled in 1975 and 2000 within a sparsely inhabited area dominated by forest and bogland in south Sweden. As an average for all the 60 elements, the median concentration was 2.7 times higher in 1975 than in 2000. The greatest difference was measured for Pb, although In, Bi, Ge, V, Sn, As and Ag had more than 5 times higher concentrations in 1975 than in 2000. Somewhat lower 1975/2000 concentration ratios (3.0-3.8) were measured for U, Sb, Cd, W, Ga, Fe, Li, and Be. The rare-earth elements (Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, and Lu), except Eu as well as Th, Ni, Al, Ti, Hf, Nb, and Zr, had concentration ratios around the average (2.5-2.8). Possible causes of these changes are discussed. We conclude that reductions in anthropogenic dust emissions during recent decades have decreased the atmospheric deposition over northern Europe of most elements in the periodical system, as previously reported for a limited number of transition and heavy metals. Changes in the deposition of soil dust would be of minor importance to the decreased deposition rates. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The aim of this study was to examine the importance of the two organic matter types as substrates for soil microbial biomass in mine soils containing organic matter with a contrasting degree of humification. Samples were taken from the lignite-containing overburden material, from a mine soil under 14-year-old black pine (Pinus nigra) and from a mine soil under 37-year-old red oak (Quercus rubra). Overburden material was ameliorated with alkaline ash and incubated in an identical manner as the 14-year-old and 37-year-old mine soils for 16 months. Carbon mineralisation was monitored throughout. After 0, 3, 6, 12 and 16 months, samples were removed and analysed for chemical parameters and for microbial biomass. In addition, 14C activity measurements in bulk soil and microbial biomass were used to estimate their lignite content. Despite the high content of organic carbon in lignite-rich overburden material, low contents of microbial biomass were recorded. Ash-amelioration led to high pH values in the overburden material, resulting in high concentrations of dissolved organic carbon most likely derived from lignite. Development of the microbial community was subsequently stimulated by presence of an easily available carbon source. In older mine soils, larger amounts of microbial biomass are most likely related to the presence of recent organic matter. Radiocarbon analysis of the microbial biomass extracted from the 14-year-old mine soil indicated higher lignite carbon contribution than recorded for microbial biomass of the 37-year-old mine soil. The highest concentration of lignite C present in microbial biomass as indicated by the Cmic/ Corg ratio was, however, observed in the ameliorated overburden material. Therefore, we conclude that the importance of lignite as a carbon source for micro-organisms decreases when recent organic matter is present in the older stages of mine soil development. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The plants were grown either singly or together with a conspecific or heterospecific individual, with arbuscular mycorrhizal inoculum present or absent. Inoculated T. europaea formed abundant arbuscular mycorrhizal structures, but the mycorrhizae did not affect its biomass or the whole plant's relative growth rate (RGR). Carex bigelowii did not form mycorrhizae, but its shoot biomass and RGR were lower in the inoculated pots. The presence of a conspecific or heterospecific plant had no effect on the shoot biomasses or RGR of either plant species. Mycorrhizal inoculation increased the root/shoot ratio of C. bigelowii in all competition treatments. The presence of C. bigelowii decreased the root/shoot ratio of T. europaea in both mycorrhizal and nonmycorrhizal state. Mycorrhizal inoculum thus had a direct negative effect on the growth of a nonmycorrhizal plant. The result suggests that although mycorrhizae may not always directly affect the performance of the host plant, they may possibly increase the host plant performance in relation to nonmycorrhizal neighbours. Mycorrhizal inoculum and mycorrhizal symbiosis may increase asymmetry of interspecific competition, which may facilitate the coexistence of plant species in cases when a larger individual is more negatively affected.","Arbuscular mycorrhiza; Competitive asymmetry; Micropropagation","Biological membranes; Biomass; Cell culture; Growth kinetics; Climate chamber experiments; Heterospecific plants; Fungi; arbuscular mycorrhiza; biomass; coexistence; interspecific competition; mycorrhiza; Carex; Carex bigelowii; Fungi; Trientalis europaea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042783502

Pure culture experiments demonstrated that chlorate selectively inhibited membrane-bound nitrate reductase (Nar) activity, probably by blocking nitrate transporters (NarK). Sediment slurry experiments showed that chlorate inhibited nitrate reduction and N2O formation, but did not inhibit nitrite reduction and its N 2O formation, indicating that chlorate selectively inhibited only the first step of nitrate reduction. Chlorite chemically oxidized nitrite to nitrate and could not be used as a selective inhibitor of nitrite metabolism, although chlorite apparently selectively inhibited formation of N2O from nitrite.

Eng., Rice University, Houston, TX, United States","Daily, seasonal, and spatial trends in fine particulate matter concentrations, compositions, and size distributions were examined using data collected through the regulatory fine particulate matter monitoring network in Southeast Texas and during the Gulf Coast Aerosol Research and Characterization Study (GC-ARCH or Houston Supersite). PM2.5 mass concentrations and compositions are generally spatially homogeneous throughout Southeast Texas when averaged over annual or seasonal time periods. There is relatively little seasonality to mean total PM2.5 mass and mean PM2.5 composition throughout the region, although slightly higher concentrations of total mass tend to occur in the spring and late fall. High FRM PM2.5 mass (&gt;20 μg/m3) occurs both when there is high spatial variability among sites and low spatial variability among sites. This suggests that both local and regional emission sources contribute to PM2.5 in Southeast Texas. Sulfate ion (32%), organic carbon (30%), and ammonium ion (9%) are the largest components on average of PM2.5 by mass. Mean diurnal patterns for PM2.5 mass concentrations throughout the region show a consistent morning peak and a weaker and slightly less consistent peak in the late afternoon to early evening. High hourly averaged PM2.5 mass concentrations (&gt;40 μg/m3) tend to be associated with daily average PM2.5 above the annual NAAQS of 15 μg/m3. These high hourly PM2.5 concentrations also tend to occur on days with high diurnal variation, indicative of elevated, short-lived PM 2.5 events. In contrast to mass concentrations, particle size distributions are not spatially homogeneous throughout Southeast Texas. Industrial sites have higher concentrations of freshly emitted, primary particles than more residential sites. Because the freshly emitted particles generally have diameters of 0.1 μm or less, these primary emissions do not have as large an impact on PM2.5 mass or bulk composition as they have on the number density of fine particles.",,"Composition; Concentration (process); Particle size analysis; Particles (particulate matter); Sulfate minerals; Fine particulate matter; Spatial trends; Aerosols; aerosol; chemical composition; spatial variation; suspended particulate matter; temporal variation; article; chemical composition; circadian rhythm; environmental monitoring; mass; particle size; particulate matter; priority journal; seasonal variation; United States; Gulf Coast [United States]; North America; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442681867

To better understand and guide such changes requires that attention is paid to the time-varying consequences that technology and economic influences have on an industry's choice of inputs and its associated (desired and undesired) outputs. This paper lays out an approach to improving our understanding of the dynamics of large industrial systems. The approach combines engineering and econometric analysis with a detailed representation of an industry's capital stock structure. A transparent dynamic computer modeling approach is chosen to integrate information from these analyses in ways that foster participation of stakeholders from industry and government agencies in all stages of the modeling process-from problem definition and determination of system boundaries to generation of scenarios and interpretation of results. Three case studies of industrial energy use in the USA are presented-one each for the iron and steel, pulp and paper, and ethylene industry. Dynamic models of these industries are described and then used to investigate alternative carbon emissions and investment-led policies. A comparison of results clearly points towards two key issues: the need for industry specific policy approaches in order to effectively influence industrial energy use, fuel mix and carbon emissions, and the need for longer time horizons than have typically been chosen for the analysis of industrial responses to climate change policies. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

According to the Moroccan Superior Council of Water and Climate (2000), the national strategy for water management policies focuses on three main priorities: (1) continuing water resource mobilisation programs, (2) applying economy of water consumption measures and (3) developing management and use of non-conventional water resources (such as brackish water and wastewater). The use of non-conventional waters such as brackish or low-quality groundwater could be considered to overcome the water scarcity problem in Morocco, especially in interior regions. Rational management and reuse of these kinds of water resources could constitute a great challenge for arid areas (such as Morocco) to improve water balance. The poor quality of these water resources is generally considered as a great obstacle to their use for drinking or for irrigation. Utilisation of an appropriate desalination approach adapted to our socioeconomic conditions could make use of low-quality waters that are quantitatively very important in our region. Indeed, chemical analysis done in the most important salty regions in Morocco - Lake Zima, situated in the Marrakech region - shows that water quality is considered salty to hyper-salty according to the classification of salty water established by Por (1977) and reported by Saadi (1994). In the south of Morocco, in the Ouarzazate region, Oued Malleh and groundwater present a great problem of salinity as shown by chemical characteristics (TDS, EC and SAR), either for superficial or for groundwater in the region (ORMVAO report, 1996). Desalination of these types of water could be more advantageous than using seawater, as they are less concentrated in salts. Furthermore, desalination of water could provide several benefits: in addition to treatment and valorisation of enhanced quality water in agriculture, it could be possible to valorise economically the desalination residues via salt extraction in extensive evaporation tanks. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Darling Marine Center, School of Marine Sciences, Univ. Maine, 193 Clark's Cove R., United States","Seasonal and inter-annual variability in satellite-derived estimates of near-surface chlorophyll a concentration and primary production were examined in three regimes (shelf, slope and deep oceanic waters) off Washington and Vancouver Island from 1998 to 2002. Wind-induced upwelling predominates in late spring and summer, coinciding with the maximum in solar radiation, leading to increased accumulations of phytoplankton biomass. Shelf chlorophyll concentrations varied from 2 to 10 mg m -3 and were generally lower in April and May and maximal in September. Chlorophyll concentrations on the slope followed a similar seasonal pattern (ranging from 0.5 to 4 mg m -3); however, concentrations were always greater on the Vancouver Island slope compared to the Washington slope for any 30-day period. Oceanic chlorophyll concentrations were generally less than 1 mg m -3 and averaged approximately 0.3 mg m -3. The Pacific Northwest is often cloud covered; data density maps provide an index of confidence in the 'regional' applicability of the summary statistics. One consequence of the 1997-1998 El Niño appears to be a reduction in chlorophyll concentration, and inferred rates of primary productivity, in slope and oceanic waters off Vancouver Island in 1998. An increased frequency of El Niño events may lead to a reduction in offshore carbon transport and sequestration, and these results help develop an understanding of the variability in carbon cycling in this dynamic upwelling region. Six-month median chlorophyll concentrations were maximal in 2002 for all subregions off Vancouver Island and for shelf and slope regions off Washington. The dramatic increases in chlorophyll concentrations seen in 2002 are consistent with hypothesized increased advection of nutrient-rich Subarctic waters into the California Current. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Heartworm is an arthropod-borne parasite of considerable economic and ecological importance. In California, coyotes serve as the primary sylvatic maintenance host and represent a useful sentinel for this parasite. To develop the model, we used a large collection of coyote blood specimens and carcasses collected from spatially broad, yet nonrandom, locations in California. Survey data were useful in refining previous coarser models that predicted uniformly high prevalence of heartworm throughout the coastal and Sierra-Nevada foothills, by indicating variability within this broadly defined plant-climate zone. Due to the non-random nature and large spatial scale of our data-set, we restricted variables to those thought to be most generally important. Modeling indicated that woodlands with a relatively dense canopy, suitable breeding and host-seeking habitat of the western treehole mosquito (Ochlerotatus sierrensis), were a good predictor of heartworm prevalence. Within this habitat, prevalence increased with precipitation, which likely affected mosquito abundance. The distribution of heartworm was limited to areas with average cumulative temperatures high enough to enable larval development of heartworms within their mosquito vectors. The prediction accuracy of our model was supported by goodness-of-fit tests, cross-validation tests and external validation tests. The model provided a useful guide to the relative risk of heartworm exposure in California, although the resolution was necessarily coarse and prevalence estimates related to risk in an ordinal manner only.",,"abundance estimation; biological invasion; canid; environmental factor; parasite prevalence; risk assessment; spatial distribution; California; North America; United States; Aedes sierrensis; Arthropoda; Canidae; Canis; Canis latrans; Culicidae; Diptera; Dirofilaria immitis; Filarioidea; Nematoda; Onchocercidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1942489101

Numerical analysis of the isotope responses after switching from 14N16O to 15N18O, from 16O2 to 18O2, from 12CH4 to 13CH4, and from C 16O2 to C18O2 in the feed gas was performed. This enables determination of (i) the concentration of different forms of NOx adspecies on Co sites, (ii) their reaction rates with methane, and (iii) the concentration of surface intermediates resulting from the interaction of NOx species with methane. The NO reduction with CH4 in the presence of oxygen was shown to proceed by two different pathways with participation of (1) NO2δ+ species (formed on nanoclusters of cobalt oxide located inside the zeolite channels) and (2) NO2- nitrite complexes (formed on larger cobalt oxide particles located outside the zeolite channels), the reaction rate by the former being appreciably higher under the SCR reaction conditions studied. Mononitrosyl species appear not to be directly involved in the overall process. Modeling results indicate that the rate of the first route is limited by the interaction of NO2δ+ species and adsorbed methane, while in the second route the formation of nitrite species is a rate-determining step. Based on the obtained results, an overall reaction mechanism of the CH4-SCR of NO in the presence of oxygen is proposed. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Single-phase fluorite-like solid solutions with a nanodomain microstructure are characterized by distortion of the coordination polyhedra caused by dopants followed by the lattice local rearrangement into that of a lower symmetry at a high dopant content. The highest performance in methane selective oxidation into syngas by the lattice oxygen is found for samples where isolated oxygen vacancies dominate. Earlier studied Pt/Ce-Zr-La-O system [Stud.

Two silica-rich blast furnace slags, with low levels of iron oxide, were used in this study. Silica concentration in these slags, labeled as 1 and 2, was 30.80 pet and 36.80 pet with a respective basicity of 1.67 and 1.22. Reaction rate investigations were supplemented with wettability measurements on these systems with an aim to probe a possible interdependence between wetting characteristics and reaction rates of silica reduction. Wettability and slag/carbon reactions were studied in a horizontal tube resistance furnace in argon atmosphere, using the sessile drop approach. While the contact angles were measured by recording live images of the assembly with a charge-coupled device camera, the volumes of CO and CO2 evolved were obtained from an analysis of off-gases with the help of a mass spectrometer. Reaction rates for silica reduction showed a wide variation for different systems. Synthetic graphite showed nonwetting behavior with both slags. Natural graphite, however, showed dynamic wetting with slag 2, resulting in low contact angles. This is attributed to the difference in the deposition of Si-based reaction products in the interfacial region, which in turn influences wettability. Temperature had a significant effect on both the wettability and silica reduction rate of the graphite/slag system. Activation energies for silica reduction in slags 1 and 2 with natural graphite were estimated to be 253 and 241 kJ/mol, respectively. Chemical composition of carbonaceous materials and slags were found to play a very important role in dictating overall reaction rates and wetting characteristics.",,"Charge coupled devices; Composition; Contact angle; Graphite; Mass spectrometers; Reaction kinetics; Reduction; Surface reactions; Thermal effects; Injection rates; Wettability; Slags",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842426756

Here, we present a study of the influence of the transmembrane pore region of an ion channel on the physical properties of a phospholipid bilayer. We performed multinanosecond molecular dynamics simulations of the pore-forming aggregate of α-helical transmembrane peptides, which constitutes a model for the channel region of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, inserted in a simple lipid bilayer at conditions similar to those of the recent NMR experiments [Opella, S. J.; et al. Nature Struct. Biol. 1999, 6, 374]. The results obtained are compared with simulations of the pure lipid bilayer membrane. In particular, we consider here the simplest possible model membrane: a fully hydrated dimyristoyl-sn-glycerophosphocholine lipid bilayer, which is in the biologically relevant fluid lamellar phase at room temperature. Our analysis reveals that the peptides affect the properties of the lipid bilayer in several ways: (1) the bilayer thickness increases (2) the number of gauche defects of the hydrocarbon chains decreases, (3) the orientational order of the hydrocarbon chains increases, (4) the orientational probability distribution of the lipid headgroup dipole moments becomes broader (more disordered), and (5) the lipid headgroup dipole moments are on average more oriented toward the water phase. Some of these effects depend on the specific properties of the case studied, such as the hydrophobic length of the bundle and the charges at the interface. Interestingly, the pore does not affect the two different sides of the membrane in the same way.",,"Agglomeration; Computer simulation; Hydrophobicity; Interfaces (materials); Lipids; Molecular dynamics; Molecular orientation; Molecular structure; Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy; Phase transitions; Probability distributions; Proteins; Lipid bilayer; Nicotinic acetylcholine; Transmembrane ion channel; Biological membranes",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542365497

The particulate level in Antarctica is extremely low compared with that in industrial countries. We hypothesized that this low level would reduce circulating leukocyte counts and serum inflammatory cytokine levels in people visiting Antarctica from industrial countries. The number density of particulates with aerodynamic diameters of <10.0 μm was measured in Japan and in Antarctica during the 41st Japanese Antarctic Research Expedition. Circulating leukocyte counts, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and interleukin-6 levels, and pulmonary function were determined at regular intervals in 39 expedition members. The particulate number density was <1% of that measured in Japan. Total leukocytes, segmented and band-formed PMN, monocyte counts, and serum interleukin-6 levels decreased in Antarctica compared with the initial values measured in Japan. Pulmonary function parameters did not change except for maximal voluntary ventilation. Particulate matter levels had more significant effects on segmented PMN, band-formed PMN, and monocyte counts than cigarette smoking and the type of work.

The indigenous masterbuilders and tribemen incorporated planning decisions pertinent to climatic, cultural, social, economic and religious factors when designing physical elements in their built environment. This is what makes every traditional settlement in the southwest region of Saudi Arabia unique in terms of urban form and social structure. As a step to examining and evaluating the process of residential neighborhood development, three stages of practiced urbanism are discussed. These stages are labelled ""vernacular"", ""transitional"" and ""new vernacularism"". These are planning concepts used worldwide in the development of residential neighborhoods throughout history until the present. ""New Vernacularism"" is envisioned in this investigation as a design/planning objective implemented in most recently planned neighborhoods in Al-Horaidhah, Southwest Saudi Arabia. The achievement of successful urbanism underlies the political goals of urban planning practice. The Al-Horaidhah planning concept is conceived in the light of preservation of community values in neighborhood design/planning as a critical issue. The paper aims to investigate and reconcile the conflicts in the planning of residential neighborhoods in a changing world. The conflicts are restricted between retaining traditions of architecture, urban design and planning with the necessary social, economic, and technological changes in urban formation, mainly, the vernacular and modern. The paper illustrates the concept ""New Vernacularism"" by presenting Al-Horaidhah scheme as a model for community development in three administrative regions along the Red Sea coastline.

Such dynamic variability of climate factors can also have significant implications for the vegetation and agricultural productivity of this region. Using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and wavelet decomposition techniques, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) monthly data over Indian sub-continent for 18 years from 1982 to 2000 have been used to study the variability of vegetation. The present study shows that the monsoon precipitation and land surface temperature over the Indian sub-continent landmass have significant impact on the distribution of vegetation. Tropospheric aerosols exert a strong influence too, albeit secondary to monsoon precipitation and prove to be a powerful governing factor. Local climate anomaly is seen to be more effective in determining the vegetation change than any global teleconnection effects. The study documents the dominating influence of monsoon precipitation and highlights the importance of aerosols on the vegetation and necessitates the need for remedial measures. The present study and an earlier one point towards a possible global teleconnection pattern of ENSO as it is seen to affect a particular mode of vegetation worldwide. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Vent gas from the deep subsurface is the starting material from which other carbon pools are derived, including gas hydrate, free hydrocarbon gas in sediment, and authigenic carbonate rock. Gas crystallizes as exposed mounds of structure II gas hydrate and as massive vein-fillings in hemipelagic mud. Venting rates from gas hydrate mounds periodically increase after the temperature of the bottom water increases. Gas hydrate decomposition is largely restricted to exposed hydrate and at shallow depth in sediment. Overall, gas hydrate is accumulating, not decomposing at study sites. Most free gas in sediment appears to be destroyed in situ by anaerobic microbial oxidation in chemosynthetic communities, leading to sequestration of carbon as abundant authigenic carbonate rock depleted in 13C. Free methane is rapidly oxidized leaving residual methane enriched in 13C. Some in situ microbial CO2 reduction occurs, and methane depleted in 13C mixes with vent methane enriched in 13C. The C2-C5 hydrocarbons of vent gas initially most depleted in 13C (ethane, isobutane, isopentane) are least affected by microbial oxidation, whereas hydrocarbons initially enriched in 13C (propane, normal butane, normal pentane) are most affected. Anaerobic microbial oxidation of all C1-C5 hydrocarbon gases, not only methane, may be significant in chemosynthetic communities. Microbial processes contribute to the development and stability of chemosynthetic communities by providing required H2S. Anaerobic microbial processes lead to deposition of diagnostic authigenic minerals related to the carbon (carbonate minerals) and sulfur cycles (pyrite, elemental sulfur), altering the seafloor. Seafloor cementation favors fauna such as chemosynthetic tubeworms and seep mussels by forming carbonate hardgrounds on an otherwise unfavorable mud-dominated seafloor. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The inclusive longitudinal and transverse momentum distributions for the core fragments together with the cross sections have been measured for breakup on a carbon target. Momentum distributions for reactions on tantalum were also measured for a subset of nuclei. An extended version of the Glauber model incorporating second-order noneikonal corrections to the Jeukenne, Lejeune, and Mahaux parametrization of the optical potential has been used to describe the nuclear breakup, while the Coulomb dissociation is treated within first-order perturbation theory. The projectile structure has been taken into account via shell-model calculations employing the psd interaction of Warburton and Brown. Both the longitudinal and transverse momentum distributions together with the integrated cross sections were well reproduced by these calculations and spin-parity assignments are thus proposed for 15B, 17C, 19-21N, 21,23O, 23-25F. In addition to the large spectroscopic amplitudes for the ν2s1/2 intruder configuration in the N=9 isotones, 14B and 15C, significant ν21/22 admixtures appear to occur in the ground state of the neighboring N=10 nuclei 15B and 16C. Similarly, crossing the N=14 subshell, the occupation of the ν2s 1/2 orbital is observed for 23O, 24,25F. Recent claims of a modified shell structure for 23O are investigated and the original suggestion of a ground state Jπ= 1/2+ is confirmed. Analysis of the longitudinal and transverse momentum distributions reveals that both carry spectroscopic information, often of a complementary nature. The general utility of high-energy nucleon removal reactions as a spectroscopic tool is also examined.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862372602

Box 342, N-7300 AH Apeldoorn, Netherlands","We present a model simulation for the year 1995 accounting for primary particles, which are an important component of fine aerosols over Europe. A new emission inventory for black carbon, (BC) was developed on the basis of the recent European emission inventory of anthropogenic primary particulate matter (Coordinated European Programme on Particulate Matter Emission Inventories, Projections and Guidance (CEPMEIP)). The annual BC emissions of Europe and the former Soviet Union for 1995 are estimated at 0.47 and 0.26 Tg C, respectively, with highest contributions from transport (off-road and on-road) and households. Modeled BC concentrations range from ≤0.05 μtg/m 3 in remote regions to more than 1 μtg/m3 over densely populated areas. The modeled BC concentration is about 25% of the total primary aerosol concentration. The primary aerosol fields were combined with previously calculated secondary aerosol concentrations to obtain an estimate of the total anthropogenic fine aerosol distribution. Modeled BC levels contribute only 4 10% to fine aerosol mass, whereas sulphate and nitrate contribute 25-50 and 5-35%, respectively. Comparison with experimental data revealed that the model underestimates PM2.5 levels, mostly caused, by the underprediction of total carbonaceous material (BC and OC) by a factor of ε12. The underestimation can partly be explained by the influence of local emissions, measurement uncertainties, natural sources, and representation of wet deposition. However, the uncertainties associated with the emission inventory for BC (and total PM) may be the most important cause for the discrepancy. In comparison with previous studies, our BC emission estimate is a factor of 2 lower, caused by the choice of more recent emission factors. Therefore a better knowledge of emission factors is urgently needed to. estimate the BC (and PM) emissions reliably.

In an early-successional plant community we reduced densities of above- and below-ground insects in a factorial design using insecticides. Beside measuring vegetation dynamics we investigated the effects of insect exclusion on above- and below-ground plant biomass, below-ground C and N storage by plants, litter quality, decomposition rate, soil water content, soil C:N ratio, nutrient availability and soil microbial activity and biomass.The application of soil insecticide had only minor effects on above- and below-ground biomass of the plant community but increased carbon content in root biomass and total carbon and nitrogen storage in roots. In one of the three investigated plant species (Cirsium arvense), application of soil insecticide decreased nitrogen concentration of leaves (-12%). Since C. arvense responded positively to soil insecticide application, this effect may be due to drought stress caused by root herbivory. Decomposition rate was slightly increased by the application of above-ground insecticide, possibly due to an impact on epigeic predators. The application of soil insecticide caused a slightly increased availability of soil water and an increased availability of mineralised nitrogen (+30%) in the second season. We explain these effects by phenological differences between the plant communities, which developed on the experimental plots. Microbial biomass and activity were not influenced by insecticide application, but were correlated to above-ground plant biomass of the previous year. Overall, we conclude that the particular traits of the involved plant species, e.g. their phenology, are the key to understand the resource dynamics in the soil. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

It appeals to both regulators and watershed stakeholders as a voluntary, businesslike approach attracting a category of sources to the table that regulators have been unable to control using traditional enforcement tools - nonpoint sources. Nonpoint source pollution is a major source of the water quality problems still needing to be addressed in watersheds throughout the United States. Following the remarkable success of the Acid Rain Program's sulfur dioxide emissions trading system, however, expectations have been raised for all pollution trading systems. To date, water quality trading projects across the US have failed to deliver on those expectations because of the predominance of the ""offset"" trading model in their program design, which is characterized by significant costs in both time and resources to support trades. In this article, we argue that, although critical differences exist between water quality trading and the ""cap and trade"" model of the Acid Rain Program, water quality trading programs should consider incorporating certain key design elements that have contributed to the Acid Rain Program's success. We describe Idaho's Lower Boise River water quality trading framework as an example of how this can be done. © 2004 National Association of Environmental Professionals.",,"acid rain; economic instrument; emissions trading; nonpoint source pollution; sulfur emission; water quality; Boise River; Idaho; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-24644481828

In the late 20th century decreases in snow days (SD) have been observed for stations below 1300 m asl. A regression model is used in this work to quantify the importance of mean temperature and precipitation as well as large-scale climate variability in order to explain the observed trends. Both, local- and large-scale models account for a modest fraction of the observed seasonal variability. Results suggest that the recent decrease in low altitude snow cover can mainly be attributed to an increase in temperature. Differences are found for northern and southern Switzerland concerning the influence of large-scale climate patterns. In contrast to southern Alpine regions, northern Alpine interannual SD variability is almost unaffected by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Decadal trends, however, can be explained via temperature only by a model that includes the explanatory variable NAO.

Steady-state simulations were performed to analyze the response of phytoplankton and submerged macrophytes to atmospheric CO2 elevation from 350 to 700 ppm. We studied various conditions that may affect this response, such as alkalinity, the air-water exchange rate of CO2, the community respiration rate, and the phosphorus (P) supply rate. The increase in atmospheric CO2 could affect submerged plant growth only under relatively eutrophic conditions and at a low community respiration rate. Alkalinity had little effect on the response of the different species. When the air-water exchange was low, the proportional effect of the CO2 increase on plant growth was higher. Under eutrophic conditions, algae and macrophytes using CO2 and HCO3- may double their growth rate due to atmospheric CO2 elevation, while the growth of macrophytes restricted to CO2 assimilation may be threefold. The differences in response of the species under various conditions indicate that the elevation of atmospheric CO2 may induce drastic changes in the productivity and species dominance in freshwater systems.","Air-water exchange; Alkalinity; Bicarbonate; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Macrophytes; Nutrients; Phosphorus; Phytoplankton","alkalinity; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; freshwater ecosystem; growth response; nutrient availability; phytoplankton; submerged vegetation; algae; Trixis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642382165

Effective diffusion coefficients of molecular nitrogen (0.39 × 10-11 to 21.6 × 10-11 m2 sec-1 at 90°C are higher than those for methane (0.18 × 10-11 to 18.2 × 10-11 m2 sec-1 at 90°C). Diffusive flux rates expressed in mass units are generally higher for N2 than for CH4. Both methane and (to a lesser extent) nitrogen diffusion coefficients decrease with increasing total organic carbon (TOC) content of the rock samples because of sorption processes on the organic matter. This effect decreases with increasing temperature. Effective diffusion coefficients increase upon a temperature increase from 50 to 200°C by a factor of four. Effective diffusion coefficients and steady-state diffusive flux decrease with effective stress. Stationary diffusive fluxes drop by 50-70% for methane and 45-62% for nitrogen while effective diffusion coefficients are reduced by 38% (CH4) and 32-48% (N2), respectively. Isotope fractionation coefficients of diffusive transport are higher for methane (-1.56 and -2.77‰) than for ethane (-0.84 and -1.62‰). Application of the experimental results to geological systems show that diffusive transport has only a low transport efficiency. Significant depletion of natural gas reservoirs by molecular diffusion is only expected in cases of very poor caprock qualities (in terms of thickness and/or porosity) and over extended periods of geological time. Under these circumstances, the chemical and isotopic composition of a gas reservoir will change and maturity estimates based on these parameters may be deceptive. To account for these potential effects, nomograms have been developed to estimate diffusive losses and apply maturity corrections.","Caprock sealing capacity; Experiments; Isotope fractionation; Molecular diffusion; Natural gas (methane, ethane, nitrogen)","diffusion; gas flow; hydrocarbon exploration; isotopic fractionation; natural gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242288432

A benchmark of domestic cogeneration by PEMFC with existing large scale power production systems such as combined steam-gas turbine cycle, clearly reveals that only fuel cell systems optimising overall energy efficiency (&gt; 85%) and electrical efficiencies (&gt; 35%) show significant primary energy savings, about 10%, compared with the best competing technology. In this context, fuel processing technology plays a dominant role. A comparison of autothermal and steam reforming concepts in a PEMFC system shows inherent advantages in terms of efficiency at low complexity for the latter. The main reason for this is that steam reforming allows for the straightforward and effective use of the anode-off gas energy in the reformer burner. Consequently, practical electrical system efficiencies over 40% seem to be achievable, most likely by steam reformers. FLOX®-steam reforming technology has reached a high state of maturity, offering diverse advantages including: compact design, stable anode off-gas usage, high efficiency, as well as simple control behaviour.

Team members' perceptions of team climate are likely to change over time in an extreme environment, and thus team climate should be considered as a dynamic outcome variable resulting from multiple factors. In order to explore team climate as a dynamic outcome, we explored whether variables at multiple levels of analysis contributed to team climate over time for teams living and working in Antarctica. Method: Data for this study were collected from volunteers involved in Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions conducted from 1996 to 2000. Multilevel analysis was used to partition and estimate the variance in team climate and to explore factors explaining variance at the group/team, individual, and weekly levels. Results: Most of the variance in perceptions of team climate was at the individual level (57%). Team climate had less variance at the group level (16%) and at the weekly level (26%). Results indicated that perceived leadership effectiveness was significantly related to team climate. Perceived leadership effectiveness accounted for an estimated 77% of the group level variance, which equated to 14% of the overall variance in team climate. Discussion: Our results suggest that exploring the characteristics and behaviors that constitute effective leadership would contribute to a more complete and useful picture of team climate, as well as guide selection research.","Antarctic; Demographic diversity; Group cohesion; Leadership effectiveness; Social isolation","adult; Antarctic Research Station; Antarctica; article; attitude; Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition; demography; female; group dynamics; human; leadership; male; normal human; social isolation; teamwork; travel; variance; work environment; NASA Center HQS; NASA Center JSC; NASA Discipline Space Human Factors; Adult; Age Factors; Antarctic Regions; Expeditions; Female; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Leadership; Male; Models, Statistical; Organizational Culture; Sex Factors; Social Behavior; Social Perception",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3442876659

In the present case the precessing jet flame is generated by mechanically rotating a round jet of propane inclined at 45° relative to the axis of rotation. Three-dimensional laser Doppler anemometry enables the fully turbulent, three-dimensional velocity field of a precessing jet flame to be measured. This provides insight into the mechanisms by which the flame is stabilized and supports previous explanations of why NOx emissions are reduced and fuel efficiency is increased in industrial precessing jet gas burners. Velocity data are presented, time-averaged, and phase-averaged at the frequency of precession. The conditional phase-averaging technique enables phase-averaged velocity contours and vectors to be obtained that reveal flow patterns and structures within the flame. Time-averaging of the velocity data also reveals the presence of a reverse flow (recirculation) region between the emerging fuel jet and its spinning axis. The recirculation and high shear is associated with a rapid decay of the mean velocity, which together act to stabilize the flame in the high velocity and high shear region near to the nozzle exit. The characteristics of the velocity field of a precessing jet flame found here are compared with previous cold-flow investigations of the same flow and with other investigations of turbulent jets. © IMechE 2004.","Diffusion flame; Turbulence","Diffusion; Doppler effect; Flow patterns; Fuels; Nozzles; Shear deformation; Turbulent flow; Fuel jets; Laser doppler anemometry; Turbulent jets; Velocity fields; Jets; flame; flow pattern; jet flow; laser Doppler anemometry; turbulence; velocity profile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-10844280826

Real-world coupling between complex systems can cause them to exhibit new collective behaviours that are not clearly demonstrable by models that do not include such coupling. Through examples from ocean circulation and atmosphere-biosphere interactions, this paper demonstrates that external forcings such as increases in GHG concentrations can push complex systems from one equilibrium state to another, with non-linear abrupt change as a possible consequence. Furthermore, the harder and faster a system is perturbed, the higher the likelihood of such surprises - a conclusion that has significant bearing on the assessment of the potential benefits of the timing and stringency of GHG abatement measures.

In a 13CO2 atmosphere under steady state conditions, only about 75% of isoprene became 13C labeled within minutes. A considerable part of the unlabeled carbon may be derived from xylem transported carbohydrates, as may be shown by feeding leaves with [U-13C]Glc. As a consequence of this treatment approximately 8% to 10% of the carbon emitted as isoprene was 13C labeled. In order to identify further carbon sources, poplar leaves were depleted of leaf internal carbon pools and the carbon pools were refilled with 13C labeled carbon by exposure to 13CO2. Results from this treatment showed that about 30% of isoprene carbon became 13C labeled, clearly suggesting that, in addition to xylem transported carbon and CO2, leaf internal carbon pools, e.g. starch, are used for isoprene formation. This use was even increased when net assimilation was reduced, for example by abscisic acid application. The data provide clear evidence of a dynamic exchange of carbon between different cellular precursors for isoprene biosynthesis, and an increasing importance of these alternative carbon pools under conditions of limited photosynthesis. Feeding [1,2-13C]Glc and [3-13C]Glc to leaves via the xylem suggested that alternative carbon sources are probably derived from cytosolic pyruvate/ phosphoenolpyruvate equivalents and incorporated into isoprene according to the predicted cleavage of the 3-C position of pyruvate during the initial step of the plastidic deoxyxylulose-5-phosphate pathway.",,"Biosynthesis; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Cells; Photosynthesis; Starch; Isoprene biosynthesis; Plants (botany); Populus; Populus alba x Populus tremula; Populus berolinensis; Populus canescens",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442650603

In its initial stages, an insufficient S supply can only be detected by quantification of S in plant tissue with chemical methods. Severe S deficiency, however, can be identified by visual symptoms. An excursion to the Harz Mountains region not only provides the opportunity to study various visual symptoms of S deficiency in the field, but also provides insight into aspects of the ecotoxicology of sulphur. Oilseed rape fields around Silstedt and Ilsenburg display a variety of typical symptoms of S deficiency such as chlorosis starting from the leaves'edge and spreading over into intercostal areas, reddish purple colouring due to the enrichment of anthocyanins, spoonlike deformations of leaves, succulence of leaves, reduced petal size or white blooming. S deficiency also affects yield structure, which is revealed in a reduced number of seeds per pod. Decreasing concentrations of airborne sulphur over the past few decades may have an impact on the composition of plant communities, which is displayed by epiphytic lichen communities near the Kästeklippen at Romkerhall. On the other hand, a surplus of sulphur may impair plant performance, too. An example for this can be studied on mosses growing in bogs in the High Harz Mountains. A soil of calcium-sulphate origin may also give rise to the development of a specialised plant community, with plant specimens being able to store up to three times the amount of sulphur in their leaves compared to specimens growing on calcium carbonate soils. Plant communities on gypsum soils can be seen in the Hainholz near Hörden. A geogenic source of sulphur exists at Rhumspringe at the southern Harz rim, where the Rhume karst spring delivers up to 5500 L of sulphur enriched water per second after high precipitation. The total annual discharge amounts to 7092 t S.","Epiphytic lichens; Gypsiferous vegetation; Harz; Oilseed rape; Sulphur deficiency; Sulphur surplus; Torfhaus bog","Brassica napus; Bryophyta; Sinapis arvensis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544268521

Hawaii, 2525 Correa Rd., H., United States","A set of published paleoclimate proxy records from the northern hemisphere, capturing different climate processes, is used to study glacial-interglacial differences in climate variability at centennial-to-millennial timescales during the past fifty thousand years. These proxy records reveal the existence of distinct oscillatory modes of the climate system. Glacial climate variability is dominated by a single mode, the Dansgaard-Oeschger cycles, composed of stadial and interstadial states. This glacial mode results in well-expressed covariations of the proxies, which are paced by a fundamental 1470-year signal. In contrast, there is no compelling evidence for a dominant and persistent centennial-to-millennial climate cycle during the Holocene. Interglacial climate variations seem to covary less pronounced than those of the last glacial period, suggesting the simultaneous activity of independent climate modes, each characterized by its own natural periods, between approximately 400-3000 years. A conceptual model is introduced to interpret this contrast in covariation at glacial-interglacial timescales. It is assumed that different climate modes can be represented by relaxation oscillators with different natural periods in the centennial-to-millennial band. Interactions among such oscillators may lead to a phase-synchronization and the development of a new climate mode with a joint frequency. We suggest that the coupled state with its synchronized dynamics resembles a glacial whereas the decoupled state represents an interglacial with its reduced covariations of climate fluctuations. The synchronization greatly enhances the frequency stability of the coupled system, and has the potential to reconcile the stability of the glacial 1470-year pacing cycle with an origin within the Earth's climate system. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

At present, there are three competing theories as to how the regulation of the process is achieved at the whole plant level. Theory one (carbon supply regulation) states that nitrogen fixation rates are regulated by either current nodule assimilate supply or through metabolism of assimilates into compounds that can be used by the bacteroids. A second theory (oxygen supply regulation) assumes that oxygen diffusion into the nodules is tightly regulated and is the principal regulatory factor for nitrogen fixation rates. A third theory (N-feedback regulation) suggests that a product of nitrogen fixation or assimilation exerts a feedback regulatory impact. The paper summarizes experimental data which support or reject the mentioned theories. Moreover, implications of nitrogen fixation under P stress and of phenomena connected with the argon or acetylene induced decline in nitrogenase activity for the understanding of nitrogen fixation regulation are discussed. It is concluded that we currently have no theory that explains all aspects and experimental results concerning the regulation of nitrogen fixation in legumes.

Some have questioned the complex modeling used to control for season in Poisson regression or the role of gaseous air pollutants as potential confounders of the association. I examined the association between deaths and particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 10 μm (PM10) using a case-crossover design. In this approach, the pollution on the day of each death is contrasted with the pollution level on control days when the subject did not die. Season and gaseous air pollutants were controlled by matching. Control days were chosen within the same month of the same year to control for season, and matched on either sulfur dioxide (SO2; within 1 ppb), nitrogen dioxide (within 1 ppb), maximum ozone (within 2 ppb), or carbon monoxide (within 0.03 ppm). The analysis was conducted in 14 U.S. cities that have daily PM10 monitoring. After matching, there were about 400,000 deaths in each analysis. Results were combined across cities using a maximum likelihood method. PM10 was a significant predictor of mortality when controlling for gaseous air pollutants, with effect sizes ranging from a 0.45% increase per 10 μg/m3 increment of PM10 [95% confidence interval (CI), 0.12-0.79%] when matched on maximum hourly ozone levels, to a 0.81% increase per 10 μg/m3 increment of PM10 (95% CI, 0.47-1.16%) when matched on 24-hr average SO2.","Air pollution; Case-crossover; Confounding; Matching; Particles","carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; air pollution; air pollution control; airborne particle; article; confidence interval; controlled study; environmental monitoring; experimental design; human; maximum likelihood method; mortality; particle size; prediction; priority journal; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14944363868

Both the severity and timing of emissions limitations and the degree to which emissions limitation obligations can be traded will affect the value of carbon and thereby the timing and magnitude of CC&S technology deployment. Emissions limits that are more stringent in the near term imply higher near-term carbon values and therefore encourage the local development and deployment of CC&S technologies. Trade in emissions obligations lowers the cost of meeting any regional or global emissions limit and so affects the rate of penetration of CC&S technologies. Trade lowers the marginal value of carbon and CC&S penetration in high cost regions and raises the marginal value of carbon and CC&S penetration in low cost regions. The net impact on the world CC&S technologies depends on whether their increased use in low-cost regions exceeds the reduced use in high-cost regions. In the long term, CC&S technologies must not only remove carbon but permanently sequester it. If reservoirs are not permanent, then the emissions and costs of control are merely displaced into the future. The paper presents quantitative estimates for the impacts of trade in emissions limitation obligations on the timing, magnitude, and geographic distribution of CC&S technologies and the marginal and total costs of carbon control.",,"Carbon; Chemical analysis; Costs; Gas emissions; Geographic information systems; Greenhouse effect; Geographic distribution; Greenhouse gas emission; Climatology; carbon sequestration; emission control; emissions trading; greenhouse gas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3342965220

Many ectothermic reptiles are active over a range of body temperatures that vary seasonally. Here we test the hypothesis that metabolic enzyme activity acclimatises seasonally in freshwater turtles (Chelodina longicollis) in addition to, or instead of, behavioural regulation of body temperatures. We measured body temperatures in free-ranging turtles (n = 3) by radiotelemetry, and we assayed phosphofructokinase (PFK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), citrate synthase (CS) and cytochrome c oxidase (CCO) activities in early autumn (March, n = 10 turtles), late autumn (May, n = 7) and mid-winter (July, n = 7) over a range of assay temperatures (10°C, 15°C, 20°C, 25°C). Body temperatures were either not different from, or higher than expected from a theoretical null-distribution of a randomly moving animal. Field body temperatures at any season were lower, however, than expected from animals that maximised their sun exposure. Turtles maintained constant PFK, LDH and CCO activities in different months, despite body temperature differences of nearly 13.0°C between March (average daily body temperature = 24.4°C) and July (average = 11.4°C). CS activity did not vary between March and May (average daily body temperature = 20.2°C), but it decreased in July. Thus C. longicollis use a combination of behavioural thermoregulation and biochemical acclimatisation in response to seasonally changing thermal conditions. Ectothermic reptiles were often thought not to acclimatise biochemically, and our results show that behavioural attainment of a preferred body temperature is not mandatory for activity or physiological performance in turtles. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Acclimatisation; Ectotherms; Performance; Reptiles; Thermoregulation","6 phosphofructokinase; citrate synthase; cytochrome c oxidase; enzyme; lactate dehydrogenase; acclimatization; animal; article; body temperature; computer simulation; kinetics; metabolism; physiology; season; skeletal muscle; thermoregulation; turtle; Acclimatization; Animals; Body Temperature; Body Temperature Regulation; Citrate (si)-Synthase; Computer Simulation; Electron Transport Complex IV; Enzymes; Kinetics; L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; Muscle, Skeletal; Phosphofructokinases; Seasons; Turtles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442473192

These changes are not easily determined, and consequently, the ability to forecast how disease changes under altered growth conditions is not simple. One method is the use of forecast climate change derived from global-change models that are analogous to general-circulation models used for weather forecasts. However, these models predict conditions on such a gross scale that they are unacceptable for most disease forecasting. Downscaling provides a method whereby weather and climate conditions estimated at a very large scale can be transferred to a fine resolution (∼200-m grid points). This process is explained, in particular, in the context of disease forecasting. An example is presented of how estimates of extreme low temperature at a local scale have been derived from a mesoscale (mid-range) weather forecast model, which in turn was derived from a general-circulation model. Similarly, the derivation of forecasts at local scale from mesoscale weather forecast models have been demonstrated for grapevine downy mildew. Important considerations of scale definition and information transfer across different scales are discussed. © 2004, Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Climate model; Downscaling; Grape downy mildew","Peronospora farinosa; Vitis; Vitis sp.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9944233596

Also, many significant technological advances in air pollution control equipment, such as the automobile exhaust gas catalytic converter, have led to effective reduction of emissions from a variety of major pollution sources. Finally, remarkable developments in instrumentation for sampling the trace species in the atmosphere have been and continue to be made. Relatively less progress has been made in understanding the biological mechanisms by which pollutants lead to human injury and mortality. In this review the focus is on the extraordinary progress that has been made over the last half century in understanding the atmospheric nature and behavior of pollutants, both gaseous and particulate. A major breakthrough was the determination of the gas-phase chemistry of both the natural and polluted atmosphere, chemistry that leads to the formation of ozone and a vast array of oxidized molecules. The mechanisms of the oxidation of atmospheric sulfur dioxide, one of the main primary pollutants, were elucidated. Finally, the chemistry, physics, and optics of atmospheric particulate matter (aerosols) have been laid open by many stunning research achievements. Whereas 50 years ago air pollution was thought to be confined to the area around a city, it is now recognized that species emitted on one continent frequently find their way to other continents.

Experimental results indicated that the NOx formation was restricted in the narrow area close to the burner exit, and that the CO-concentration decreased drastically with the combustion gas stream through the tube-bank.

Urban drainage in cold regions, which is dominated by snowmelt, is especially vulnerable to climate change and is investigated in this paper within the context of future rehabilitation of the sewer network. The objectives are to illustrate the relative response of urban drainage to changes in both the pipe network and climate and demonstrate the use of response surfaces for climate change studies. An incremental climate scenario approach is used to generate two sensitivity analyses for waste water inflows to the Lycksele waste water treatment plant in north-central Sweden. Air temperature and precipitation data (1984-1993) are altered incrementally between -5 and +15°C and -10 and +40% respectively. These data are then used to drive a hydrological transformation model to obtain estimates of sewer infiltration from groundwater. The results are presented as winter and spring response surfaces - these are graphical representations of a response matrix where each point relates to a single model run. Climate scenario envelopes which summarise a series of GCM runs (ACACIA; Carter, 2002, pers. comm.) are overlaid to indicate the range of plausible waste water inflows. Estimates of natural multi-decadal variability are also included. The first sensitivity analysis assumes no change to the drainage system while the second simulates sewer renovation in which the system is fully separated and sewer infiltration is reduced. The main conclusions are that innovations in drainage network technology have a greater potential to alter waste water inflows than climate change and that, while the direction of climate change is fairly certain, there is great uncertainty surrounding magnitude of those changes and their impacts.",,"Air; Drainage; Flow of water; Hydrology; Infiltration; Precipitation (meteorology); Wastewater treatment; Bio-physical impacts; Non-climatic changes; Water systems; Climate change; climate change; urban area; wastewater; water management; Eurasia; Europe; Northern Europe; Scandinavia; Sweden; Acacia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3343008089

These changes are commonly attributed to the greenhouse effect resulting from increased carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration. The greenhouse effect should be most pronounced in the Arctic where the largest air CO2 concentrations and winter-summer variations in the world for a clean background environment were detected [Conway et al., 1994; Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory Data Archive, http://www.cmdl.noaa.gov/info/ftpdata.html]. Some increased seasonal variation may be a consequence of increasing summer CO2 assimilation by plants in response to higher temperature and longer growing season [Keeling et al., 1996]. Here we show that sea-ice melt ponds and open brine channels form an important spring/summer air CO2 sink that also must be included in any Arctic regional CO2 budget; both the direction and amount f CO2 transfer between air and sea during the open water season may be different from transfer during freezing and thawing, or during winter when CO2 accumulates beneath Arctic sea-ice.

The belt parallel Mountain Front, the N-S trending Kazerun, Izeh and E-W trending Bala Rud Fault Zones are defined as the master structural elements of the Belt. These fault zones divide the Zagros basin into zones with different stratigraphic successions and different rheological profiles. This resulted in different structural styles developing along the belt during the subsequent collision.The Kazerun and Izeh Fault Zones acted as the depositional system transition zone between the Lurestan and Fars regions in Jurassic-Cretaceous time and partly controlled the distribution of the Kazhdumi Formation (one of the major source rocks). By the end of the Cretaceous the NW-SE trending Mountain Front Fault divided the present Folded Belt of the Zagros into a major foreland basin to the southwest, and a piggyback basin to the northeast. Activity along other major (transfer) fault zones including the Izeh, Kazerun and Bala Rud Fault zones occurred at this time and controlled the sedimentation and subsidence of the Dezful Embayment the main target region for hydrocarbon exploration. These fault zones controlled the thickness of the Asmari Formation (one of the main reservoirs) and also the considerable thickness and facies changes of the Gachsaran Formation (the major seal to the Asmari Formation). The present morphology of the mountain belt is interpreted as being mainly related to the pinning of the Mountain Front Fault to the northwest of the Dezful Embayment and to the north of the Strait of Hormuz. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In years 1998-1999 radon measurements were taken in Landriano, an area located 30 km south of the town. In Lombard plain there are numerous huge plants, thermoelectric power stations burning by methane and carbon, oil refineries; moreover other plants are being carried out. With the aim to control the contribute of these plants to air pollution, it is important to know atmospheric stability and turbulence conditions.

Increased greenhouse gas concentrations and warm sea-surface temperatures (SSTs) do much to reproduce the climate indicated by proxy data; however, discrepancies between model output and data remain, and a term in the equable climate equation is clearly missing. Based on proxy data indications of reduced early Paleogene seasonality, we test the climate impact of a reduction in Earth's obliquity to 18°. Obliquity is one of the few forcing factors that can directly affect seasonality, and our hypothesis of changing obliquity is supported by large planetary mass redistributions in the past 120 m.y. Such mass redistributions have the potential to change the tilt of Earth's axis. In our experiment the combination of reduced obliquity, increased early Paleogene greenhouse gas concentrations, and conservatively warm SSTs reproduces early Paleogene climate with greater accuracy than any previous modeling efforts and provides a plausible solution to the equable climate challenge. © 2004 Geological Society of America.","Eocene; Obliquity; Paleocene; Paleoclimate; Paleogene","Greenhouse gases; Sea-surface temperatures; Climatology; Greenhouses; Ice; Geology; climate forcing; greenhouse gas; obliquity; paleoclimate; Paleogene; sea surface temperature; Arctic Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142678003

Sniffer is a NADPH-dependent carbonyl reductase belonging to the enzyme family of short-chain dehydrogenases/reductases (SDRs). The crystal structure of the homodimeric Sniffer protein from Drosophila melanogaster in complex with NADP+ has been determined by multiple-wavelength anomalous dispersion and refined to a resolution of 1.75 Å. The observed fold represents a typical dinucleotide-binding domain as detected for other SDRs. With respect to the cofactor-binding site and the region referred to as substrate-binding loop, the Sniffer protein shows a striking similarity to the porcine carbonyl reductase (PTCR). This loop, in both Sniffer and PTCR, is substantially shortened compared to other SDRs. In most enzymes of the SDR family this loop adopts a well-defined conformation only after substrate binding and remains disordered in the absence of any bound ligands or even if only the dinucleotide cofactor is bound. In the structure of the Sniffer protein, however, the conformation of this loop is well defined, although no substrate is present. Molecular modeling studies provide an idea of how binding of substrate molecules to Sniffer could possibly occur. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Adverse effect of MTBE, the gasoline additive, against 11 soil inhabitant Streptomyces spp. isolates was investigated. MTBE, an octane enhancer is added to gasoline to reduce atmospheric concentrations of carbon monoxide and ozone. It contaminates soil and groundwater by fuel leaks and spills. Streptomyces spp. are of the major contributors to the biological buffering of soils by exerting beneficial and antagonistic activity against wide range of bacteria and fungi. To evaluate anti-streptomycetidal activity of MTBE, it was tested against 11 soil isolates of Streptomyces isolates and also a plant-root bacterial pathogen, Erwinia carotovora and a plant-root fungal pathogen, Fusarium solani. MTBE did not reveal any growth inhibitory activity against E. carotovora and F. solani, but showed strong inhibitory effect against Streptomyces isolates. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) on Streptomyces isolates was 1/800 of the original MTBE. Fuel leaks and spills have the potential to suppress or eliminate the Streptomyces role in the soil causing alteration in the balance of soil micro flora.

As the reaction time increased the amount of carbon deposited on the catalyst also increased. The carbon deposited on the catalyst during the first hour of reaction appears to be very active and was removed readily by reacting with 2 vol.% oxygen in helium at 660 °C and the catalyst recovered its original activity and selectivity after removal of carbon. During the temperature-programmed oxidation (TPO) of deposited carbon the catalyst consumed a significant amount of oxygen forming nickel oxide, only a fraction of which is consumed by reacting with carbon species on the surface. This indicates that the surface oxygen plays a significant role in oxidizing and removing carbon species from the catalyst surfaces. Pulse reaction and oxidation experiments show that methane is activated on the surfaces of both the oxidized and reduced catalyst whereas the CO2 activation requires the catalyst to be in reduced state. Carbon deposited on the catalyst is formed from both methane and CO2, possibly via disproportionation of CO which is produced from both 13CH4 and 12CO2. © Elsevier B.V.

Since the 1980s, reforestation activities have been implemented in the area surrounding the Qianyanzhou Forest Experimental Station in Jiangxi Province, China. Farmland and heavily eroded waste land were replanted with fruit, orchards and forest plantations. The area surrounding the Qianyanzhou Forest Experimental Station was selected as research site to analyze the potential of reforestation in carbon sequestration. This study evaluates the variation of soil organic carbon storage under the different land use types. Soil organic carbon storage varied greatly with land use types. From 1984 to 2002, soil organic carbon storage increased 2.45 × 106 kg across eight land use types. This study demonstrates the potential for carbon sequestration in soils from reforestation. However, a complete understanding of soil carbon fluxes at the landscape scale will depend on the potential and retention period of soil organic carbon. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.",,"Carbon; Erosion; Forestry; Soils; Carbon fluxes; Carbon sequestration; Carbon storage; Soil organic carbon; Land use; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; reforestation; soil carbon; Carbon; Erosion; Forests; Land Use; Plantations; Reforestation; Soil; Asia; China; Eastern Hemisphere; Eurasia; Far East; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-20144380177

A side-by-side comparison in one laboratory (Lewes exercise) was made with two hybrid total organic carbon (TOC) instruments linked to chemiluminescence detectors (CLD), a combined TOC total nitrogen (TN) instrument, and two stand-alone TN instruments. Later, a series of field samples was run in home laboratories of the participants (Homelab exercise) using four hybrid TOC-CLD systems, the combined TOC/TN instrument, and three stand-alone TN instruments. In the Lewes and Homelab exercises, samples were also run by the more established persulfate oxidation method. There was fairly good agreement (group precision) among all the HTC methods; average %CV of ± 12.0% for five nitrogen compounds and average %CV of ± 7.7% for five natural samples in the Lewes exercise and %CV of ± 10.7% for 14 field samples in the Homelab exercise. In both cases, the persulfate method values were similar to those of the HTC instruments. On a finer scale of evaluation, the stand-alone TN instruments, operating at higher combustion temperatures, gave considerably more scatter and more divergent values than the set of HTC instruments that used a singular combustion environment with a lower temperature. The five hybrid systems, with Shimadzu TOC instruments combined with five different CLD systems and employing individual integration programs, gave a group precision of ± 5.8% for the field samples. These systems also provided simultaneous dissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentrations, and the DOC group precision for the 14 samples was ± 5.9%. Our conclusion is that the five Shimadzu instrument systems provide more accurate TDN measurements than the stand-alone instruments. However, when subtracting inorganic nitrogen (DIN) to calculate dissolved organic nitrogen (DON), there is not good agreement, especially for deep ocean samples. The persulfate method gave slightly higher TDN concentrations for the field samples than the Shimadzu HTC averages, indicating a possibility of incomplete conversion of some nitrogen compounds by the HTC instruments and/or peak integration problems. The inequity with persulfate oxidation and the scatter with the HTC methods require further investigation. A new broad community DON comparison is currently underway which includes TDN and DIN analyses. In addition, several of us are informally collaborating to improve and evaluate routine analysis with HTC instrumentation. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

An odour threshold concentration of 1 OuEm-3 is the level at which an odour is detectable by 50% of screened panellists. A new odour annoyance criterion (C98,1-h (98%-ile, 1-h average odour concentration) ≤4. 3 OuEm-3) was developed in this study and compared to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) (Ireland) recommendation (C 98,1-h≤6 OuE m-3) using the ISCST3 model with data from three meteorological stations. Abatement techniques such as exhaust vent modification, feed manipulation, and biofiltration were assessed. Based on current limits (C98,1-h≤6 OuEm-3) for existing facilities, predicted setback distances can be up to 780 m for a 1000-sow unit, depending on which meteorological data set is used. However, if using the suggested odour impact criterion in this research (C 98,1-h≤4.3 OuEm-3), setback distances could reach a maximum of 1000 m. Biofilters on second stage weaning and finishing pig buildings offer the greatest single reduction (up to 650 m) in odour impact. When combined with feed manipulation and increased exhaust air velocity, the figure can be as high as 920 m. Due to the critical requirement for local meteorological data, it is recommended that a meteorological station be installed on large pig units to facilitate more accurate predictions. Site measurements of odour emissions should be made in each case because emissions are influenced by a range of local factors including feed, manure management, building design and operation. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

The long-term-averaged deposition of sulfur and nitrogen is estimated with a simplified chemical model and the K-mean clustering technique. The three consecutive days of gridded daily mean National Center for Environmental Protection (NCEP) reanalyzed 850 hPa geopotential height fields with and without precipitation on the last day over South Korea are used for clustering of synoptic patterns for the period of 1994-1998. Two emission conditions are simulated for each cluster to estimate long-term averaged depositions of sulfur and nitrogen by long-range transport and local emissions over South Korea. One condition takes all emissions within the simulated domain into account as a base case and the other condition excludes all South Korean emissions but includes all of the other emissions, as a control case. The results of the present study indicate that the contribution of long-range transport to the annual total deposition over South Korea is found to be about 40% (530 eq ha -1yr -1) for sulfur and 49% (650 eq ha -1yr -1) for nitrogen, of which 55% for sulfur and 58% for nitrogen are contributed by wet deposition. This suggests the importance of wet deposition through the transformed acidic precursors for long-range transport to South Korea's total deposition of sulfur and nitrogen. The estimated exceedance for South Korean ecosystems indicates that the current estimate of total sulfur deposition affects about 42% of the South Korean ecosystems adversely, of which 14% is attributed to South Korean source only and the rest 28% is attributed to long-range transport together with South Korean source. Long-range transport of sulfur itself does not exceed the maximum critical load of sulfur. On the other hand, the current estimate of total nitrogen deposition is found to affect all South Korean ecosystems adversely. About 65% and 15% of the Korean ecosystems are, respectively, found to be affected adversely by South Korean nitrogen emissions and by long-range transport, suggesting that the reduction of nitrogen deposition from both South Korean sources and long-range transport is a prerequisite to ensure South Korean ecosystem sustainability. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The nearest-neighbor distance of Pt-Pt in the active catalyst was evidently shorter than those in metallic platinum and in the catalyst prepared from the support not-pretreated with the NaOH solution, while it was longer than the catalyst prepared from the employment of H2-reduction for NaBH4-reduction. However, the distances in those catalysts prepared in the present study were longer than those of Pt2+ and Pt4+. The high dispersion of Pt, which is established with the employment of NaBH4-reduction and the support pretreated with NaOH, affords a more covalent nature for the platinum species, resulting in the highest activities for the dehydrogenation of decalin to naphthalene. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In each enzyme the diiron core plays a central role in the highly specific reaction. To elucidate mechanisms of these reactions, many experimental studies have been carried out, and bioinorganic model compounds have also been synthesized for the purpose. In this study electronic structures of diiron centers for Hr model compounds are investigated from the viewpoint of magnetic interactions. To this end, the Hubbard model for the three-center four-electron bond is analytically solved to elucidate an important role of electron correlation and the resulting superexchange interaction between localized spins. The hybrid density functional theory (DFT) calculations also are performed for Hr model compounds to provide the natural orbitals and their occupation numbers, which are crucial for computations of several chemical indices, such as effective bond order, information entropy, and unpaired electron density. These indices are useful for characterization and understanding of chemical bonds in FeOFe cores. The calculated effective exchange integrals (Jab) are wholly consistent with the available experiments. The orbital interactions in the FeOFe cores are reconsidered in relation to recent work by other groups. It is found that magnetic interactions are sensitive to the hydrogen bonds in the systems and are related to effective regulation of the activity. Implications of the calculated results are discussed in relation to the nature of chemical bonds in the FeOFe cores of several biological systems. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Diiron; Effective exchange integral; Hemerythrin; Hybrid density functional theory; Hydroxo; Magnetic interaction; Natural orbitals; Oxo; Superexchange interaction","Carrier concentration; Electronic structure; Hydrogen bonds; Mathematical models; Probability density function; Quantum theory; Electron correlations; Hydroxy diiron cores; Magnetic interactions; Metalloenzymes; Enzymes",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-19944389898

We identify that the fundamental motivation behind the practice of clearing forestland with fire by the polluters is economic in nature. We then argue that the major victims of the forest fires and haze are likely to play a vital role in the solution of the problem, at least by motivating the polluters, even if they cannot force them not to pollute. Thus, the polluters and victims can be regarded as the 'stakeholders' who would take interest and participate actively in the policy regime. A regional model is developed to analyze and specifically to take account of the states responsible for and affected by the haze. The problems of the affected resident population, the forest industries, and the role of the regional governments are modeled. The model also highlights the importance of key variables in determining the severity of the haze, namely the magnitude of the investment in fire fighting, risk mitigation, and scale of fire operations; including forecasting weather conditions. We argue that optimal policy options should simultaneously satisfy the economic needs of the key stakeholders to be effective.",,"atmospheric pollution; haze; pollution policy; stakeholder; transboundary pollution; Asia; Eurasia; Southeast Asia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344563313

We used a long-term tropical reforestation project (55-61 yr) to estimate rates of above- and belowground C sequestration and to investigate the impact of planted species on overall plant community structure. Thirteen tree species (nine native and four nonnative species) were planted as part of the reforestation effort in the mid to late 1930s. In 1992, there were 75 tree species (&gt;9.1 cm dbh) in the forest. Overall, planted species accounted for 40% of the importance value of the forest; planted nonnative species contributed only 5% of the importance value. In the reforested ecosystem, the total soil C pool (0-60 cm depth) was larger than the aboveground C pool, and there was more soil C in the forest (102 ± 10 Mg/ha [mean ± 1 SE]) than in an adjacent pasture of similar age (69 ± 16 Mg/ha). Forest soil C (C3-C) increased at a rate of ∼0.9 Mg·ha-1·yr-1, but residual pasture C (C4-C) was lost at a rate of 0.4 Mg·ha -1yr-1, yielding a net gain of 33 Mg/ha as a result of 61 years of forest regrowth. Aboveground C accumulated at a rate of 1.4 ± 0.05 Mg·ha-1·yr-1, to a total of 80 ± 3 Mg/ha. A survey of 426 merchantable trees in 1959 and 1992 showed that they grew faster in the second 33 years of forest development than in the first 22 years, indicating that later stages of forest development can play an important role in C sequestration. Few indices of C cycling were correlated with plant community composition or structure. Our results indicate that significant soil C can accumulate with reforestation and that there are strong legacies of pasture use and reforestation in plant community structure and rates of plant C sequestration.","Biodiversity; Biomass; C isotopes; C sequestration; Luquillo Experimental Forest; Nonnative species; Productivity; Puerto Rico; Tropical reforestation","biodiversity; carbon sequestration; community structure; plant community; reforestation; Bos taurus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444327816

Local variations in emission properties affect the overall signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) value of the scanning electron microscope image. In the case in which emission noise is assumed to be absent, the image SNRs for silicon and gold on a black background are identical. This is because only shot noise in the primary beam affects the SNRs, irrespective of the assumed noiseless secondary electron emission or backscattered electron emission processes. The addition of secondary emission noise degrades the SNR. Materials with higher secondary electron yield and backscattering electron yield give rise to higher SNR. For images formed from two types of material, the contrast of the image is lower. The reduction in image signal reduces the overall image SNR. As expected, large differences in δ or η give rise to higher SNR images.","Binomial distribution; Poisson distribution; Secondary emission noise; Shot noise","Backscattering; Gold; Scanning electron microscopy; Signal to noise ratio; Silicon; Emission properties; Secondary electron yield; Spurious signal noise; gold; silicon; article; binomial distribution; emission noise; mathematical analysis; noise; Poisson distribution; priority journal; scanning electron microscopy; shot noise; signal noise ratio; simulation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1242318845

At the molecular to cellular level, single-cell techniques in molecular biology allow us to identify the microbes involved in cycling of dimethylated sulfur. Also, we find that dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) is as ubiquitous as dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) in marine plankton, which supports the recent suggestion that both compounds are involved in coping with oxidative stress. At the community level, there is recent evidence for the role of DMSP as a major carrier in organic sulfur transfer and cycling through trophic levels, from phytoplankton to bacteria and to zooplankton through herbivore protozoans. As a consequence, the food web dynamics drive the oceanic emission of atmospheric sulfur. At the ecosystem level, the diverse and intricate effects of the physicochemical setting (light, wind, nutrients) on the oceanic cycling of dimethylated sulfur are being uncovered. A proposed shortcut to detailed understanding of the individual processes presents the depth of the surface mixed layer as the variable that integrates most of the environmental effects and serves for predicting dimethylsulfide (DMS) concentrations, even at the global ocean level.

Additional treatments included inorganic nutrients and an oiled control (intrinsic). Sediment samples were analyzed for petroleum chemistry, nutrients, microbial population numbers (most-probable-number), and toxicity (Microtox ® 100% Test and amphipod bioassay). The GC-MS results for ""total target saturate hydrocarbons"" and ""total target aromatic hydrocarbons"" were hopane-normalized for petroleum biodegradation interpretation. When comparing the enhanced treatments to the oiled control, there were no statistical differences in the first-order biodegradation rate coefficients. Similarly, there were no statistical differences in the microbial population numbers. The nutrient analyses indicated that there were higher ammonium concentrations for the inorganic nutrients treatment and one of the bioaugmentation product treatments. There was statistically-higher amphipod mortality for all three bioremediation treatments as well as the oiled control when compared to the unoiled control plots. However, whether this is due to the amendments or the oil is uncertain. There was no statistical correlation between oil concentrations and Microtox ® toxicity (r 2 &lt; 0.01).

In Norway, hydropower generation dominates, while the Swedish electricity production largely consists of equal shares of hydro and nuclear power production. There is a larger share of fossil fuel power generation in Finland and, especially, in Denmark. Cross-border trade between the countries is considerable. Increased use of electricity anywhere in the region may thus entail augmented emissions of greenhouse gases. The amount of increased emissions due to additional electricity usage will depend on the type of generation supplying the additional electricity. Similarly, a decrease in electricity usage may involve reduced greenhouse gas emissions. In this paper, we discuss some different ways to account for changes in greenhouse gas emissions because of a changed use or supply of electricity. A comprehensive accounting scheme should provide an accurate link between various types of energy measures and their related emissions in order to facilitate cost-effective carbon dioxide mitigation procedures. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Combined gas turbine cycles involving air humidification are particularly attractive, since they provide additional power with improved efficiency. Water or steam addition promotes the reduction of nitrogen oxides emissions, for both the premixed and non-premixed modes of operation. Consequently, there is an urgent need for thorough understanding of the combustion chemistry and flow-chemistry interaction under high pressure and high humidity conditions as well as simulating the turbulent flow field with realistic chemistry. Both objectives require the development of reduced kinetic mechanisms. Reduced mechanisms for methane combustion valid for high pressure and high humidity are developed here, using the CSP (computational singular perturbation) method. The effects of humidity and pressure on the dynamics of NO formation pathways are discussed. A reaction progress variable model for the simulation of turbulent combustion is also developed, valid for adiabatic, non-adiabatic, premixed as well as partly or non-premixed combustion of various fuels, including natural gas, hydrogen and syngas. The model utilizes the CSP methodology for accurate mapping of the pertinent thermochemical data on a set of two reaction progress variables.

Forest management, cropland management, grazing land management and re-vegetation are allowable activities under Article 3.4 of the Kyoto Protocol. Soil carbon sinks and sources can therefore be included under these activities. The Kyoto Protocol states that sinks and sources of carbon should be accounted for 'taking into account uncertainties, transparency in reporting, verifiability'. At its most stringent, verifiability would entail the sampling of each geo-referenced piece of land subject to an Article 3.4 activity at the beginning and end of a commitment period, using a sampling regime that gives adequate statistical power. Soil and vegetation samples and records would be archived and the data from each piece of land aggregated to produce a national figure. Separate methods would be required to deliver a second set of independent verification data. Such an undertaking at the national level would be prohibitively expensive. At its least stringent, verifiability would entail the reporting of areas under a given practice (without geo-referencing) and the use of default values for a carbon stock change for each practice, to infer a change for all areas under that practice. A definition of verifiability between these extremes would allow simple methods, such as those derived from IPCC default values for CO2 fluxes from soil, to be used for estimating changes in soil carbon.

A typical full-service machine shop, which is representative of 55% of the engine remanufacturers in the United States, was inventoried, and three scenarios for part replacement were analyzed. The life-cycle model showed that the remanufactured engine could be ' produced with 68% to 83% less energy and 73% to 87% fewer carbon dioxide emissions. The life-cycle model showed significant savings for other air emissions as well, with 48% to 88% carbon monoxide (CO) reductions, 72% to 85% nitrogen oxide (NOx) reductions, 71% to 84% sulfur oxide (SOx) reductions, and 50% to 61% nonmethane hydrocarbon reductions.

Here, we report on the partitioning of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to particulate organic carbon (POC), dominated by planktonic primary production, in the open Baltic Sea during a 25-month period. The organic carbon-normalized partition coefficient (Koc was corrected for temperature, salinity, and sorption to filter-passing organic carbon. At all 21 sampling occasions, the log Koc-log Kow regression was significantly linear, despite a large variation in biogeochemical parameters such as POC concentration and composition, primary production, and phytoplankton species composition. These data strongly suggest that partitioning of PCBs to POC in temperate surface waters is equilibrated and therefore not kinetically limited by factors such as rapid phytoplankton growth rate or large cell size. The partitioning of PCBs to the POC was described throughout seasonal cycles by log Koc = 0.88 ± 0.07 log Kow ± 0.90 ± 0.47 (95% confidence interval). The slope of the log Koc-log K ow regression for the single sampling occasions varied between 0.56 and 1.25, and there was a seasonal variation in the POC sorbent quality (e.g., log Koc for PCB 28 varied between 5.5 and 6.9; median 5.9). These variations reflect the variability in structural composition of the POC pool in such pelagic waters. Being able to predict particle-water partitioning of HOCs significantly reduces the required complexity of both food web uptake models and predictions of POC-mediated export of HOCs to the deep ocean.",,"Geochemistry; Hydrophobicity; Microorganisms; Polychlorinated biphenyls; Regression analysis; Salinity measurement; Sorption; Biogeochemistry; Salinity; Environmental engineering; organic carbon; organic compound; polychlorinated biphenyl; surface water; water; organic pollutant; particulate organic carbon; partitioning; PCB; photic zone; phytoplankton; adsorption; article; Baltic Sea; biogeochemistry; cell size; chemical composition; concentration (parameters); deep sea; equilibrium constant; filter; growth rate; hydrophobicity; kinetics; nonhuman; ocean environment; partition coefficient; pelagic zone; photic zone; phytoplankton; pollution transport; primary production (biomass); salinity; seasonal variation; species composition; temperature; Baltic States; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollutants; Kinetics; Models, Theoretical; Particle Size; Phytoplankton; Polychlorinated Biphenyls; Solubility; Temperature; Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Atlantic Ocean; Baltic Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442276497

Cells of strain Nor1T were curved motile rods with a length of 2.6-3 μm, a width of about 0.5 μm and lateral flagellation. The cell wall structure was of the Gram-negative type. Strain Nor1T was thermophilic (temperature range for growth was 40-68 °C, with an optimum at 60 °C) and neutrophilic (pH range for growth was 6.5-7.6, with an optimum at 6.8-7.0). It grew chemolithotrophically on CO (generation time, 1.15 h), producing equimolar quantities of H2 and CO2 according to the equation CO+H2O → CO2 + H2. During growth on CO in the presence of ferric citrate or amorphous ferric iron oxide, strain Nor1T reduced ferric iron but produced H2 and CO2 at a ratio close to 1:1, and growth stimulation was slight. Growth on CO in the presence of sodium selenite was accompanied by precipitation of elemental selenium. Elemental sulfur, thiosulfate, sulfate and nitrate did not stimulate growth of strain Nor1T on CO and none of these chemicals was reduced. Strain Nor1T was able to grow on glucose, sucrose, lactose, arabinose, maltose, fructose, xylose and pyruvate, but not on cellobiose, galactose, peptone, yeast extract, lactate, acetate, formate, ethanol, methanol or sodium citrate. During glucose fermentation, acetate, H2 and CO2 were produced. Thiosulfate was found to enhance the growth rate and cell yield of strain Nor1T when it was grown on glucose, sucrose or lactose; in this case, acetate, H2S and CO2 were produced. In the presence of thiosulfate or ferric iron, strain Nor1T was also able to grow on yeast extract. Lactate, acetate, formate and H2 were not utilized either in the absence or in the presence of ferric iron, thiosulfate, sulfate, sulfite, elemental sulfur or nitrate. Growth was completely inhibited by penicillin, ampicillin, streptomycin, kanamycin and neomycin. The DNA G+C content of the strain was 51.7 ± 1 mol%. Analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that strain Nor1T belongs to the Bacillus-Clostridium phylum of the Gram-positive bacteria.

This uncatalyzed variation of the Meerwein-Ponndorf-Oppenauer-Verley reaction gives, in certain cases, e.g., reduction of acetophenone or benzaldehyde by i-PrOH, almost quantitative yields. Yields are higher with secondary alcohols such as i-PrOH than with a primary alcohol such as EtOH. The reactions were also performed in a flow system by passing at a slow rate the same solutions through a glass or a metal coil heated to elevated temperatures. Ab initio calculations performed at the B3LYP/6-31G* level show that thermodynamically i-PrOH is a more potent reducing agent than EtOH by ca. 4 kcal/mol. The computations also show that in cases of aromatic carbonyl compounds, part of the deriving force is obtained from the entropy change of the reaction. The major contributor to the high yield, however, is the excess alcohol used, which shifts the equilibrium to the right.

Although several myocardial iodine 123 metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) indices are increasingly used to detect alterations in myocardial sympathetic activity in various forms of cardiac pathology, published measurements of normal values and within-subject variability are lacking. Methods and results. Twenty-five healthy volunteers underwent planar and single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging. Heart-mediastinum ratio (H/M) and myocardial washout were calculated from planar images comparing three different methods for the assessment of myocardial activity: (1) global region over the myocardium (cavity included), (2) global region over the myocardium (cavity excluded), and (3) fixed small myocardial region. Segmental (relative) uptake and washout were assessed by SPECT. For all MIBG indices, the interindividual variation was the lowest for methods 1 and 2. In SPECT this variation was low for relative segmental uptake compared with washout. In 9 subjects a second MIBG scintigraphy was performed after 3 months. The within-subject variability of H/M and washout assessed by planar methods 1 and 2 was 5%, whereas it was approximately 9% for planar method 3. For relative segmental uptake from SPECT, this variability was 5%. Conclusion. MIBG H/M (planar) and relative segmental uptake (SPECT) show a low interindividual and within-subject variability. This enables the detection of small (regional) variations in myocardial sympathetic nervous function, especially to monitor the effect of therapeutic interventions in patients with various cardiac diseases. © 2004 American Society of Nuclear Cardiology.","Cintigraphy; Iodine 123 metaiodobenzylguanidine; Normal subjects; Single photon emission computed tomography","(3 iodobenzyl)guanidine i 123; (3 iodobenzyl)guanidine; diagnostic agent; radiopharmaceutical agent; adult; article; cardiovascular disease; controlled study; drug uptake; female; heart function; human; human experiment; image analysis; male; mediastinum; medical assessment; normal human; normal value; patient monitoring; priority journal; single photon emission computer tomography; statistical analysis; sympathetic function; volunteer; clinical trial; heart; heart muscle; metabolic clearance rate; metabolism; methodology; middle aged; Netherlands; reference value; reproducibility; scintiscanning; sensitivity and specificity; standard; statistics; 3-Iodobenzylguanidine; Adult; Female; Heart; Humans; Male; Metabolic Clearance Rate; Middle Aged; Myocardium; Netherlands; Radiopharmaceuticals; Reference Values; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542469905

The cytosolic pH in the leaves of the mutant was significantly higher than that in the wild type. chx23 mutants displayed a high sensitivity to NaCl.

To gain a better understanding of phosphorus flux at the sediment-water interface, it is crucial to investigate the sediment porewater. There is also growing concern and interest in identifying whether organic-rich sediment is an important source of greenhouse gases such as CO2 and CH4. In the present study, we took sediment samples from West Lake, a shallow hypereutrophic lake in Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China and incubated subsamples under anaerobic conditions at 25°C for 182 d using a specially designed microcosm that permits repeated extraction of sediment porewater and sampling of headspace gases. Anaerobic phosphate fluxes and mineralization of sediment organic carbon were measured. Average diffusive flux of soluble phosphorus was 0.81 mg P m-2 d-1 during the initial 18 d of incubation. Decomposition of sediment organic C followed zero-order reaction kinetics and methane accounted for about 50% of the mineralization products. The results suggest that organic-rich sediments can be important sources of P and methane under anaerobic conditions. Laboratory studies simulating field conditions and field studies are necessary to determine the contribution of sediment as a source of P and greenhouse gases.",,"Carbon; Greenhouse effect; Lakes; Methane; Phosphorus; Reaction kinetics; Sediments; Lake sediment; Phosphorus flux; Sediment porewater; Sediment-water interface; Phosphates; carbon; carbon dioxide; methane; organic matter; phosphate; phosphorus; article; decomposition; dynamics; greenhouse gas; kinetics; lake sediment; microcosm; mineralization; oxidation reduction potential; pH",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8744272333

Roosevelt, Dworshak, Wallula, Shasta, Oroville, and New Melones) were sampled in order to estimate their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Two types of fluxes were assessed: (1) diffusive fluxes of methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) at the air/water interface and (2) degassing fluxes of CH4 and CO2 from water passing through the turbine spillways. Diffusive flux measurements indicated that the surface of the reservoirs were a source of CH4 during the sampling period (from +3.2 to +9.5 mg CH4 m -2 d-1). Oroville (+1026 mg CO2 m-2 d-1) and Shasta (+1247 mg CO2 m -2 d-1) surfaces were also sources of CO 2. In contrast, the surface of all the other reservoirs constituted sinks for CO2 (from -349 to -1195 mg CO 2 m-2 d-1). Degassing fluxes ranged from +0.003 to +0.815 t CH4 d-1, and from +16 to +324 t CO2 d-1. Daily GHG budgets ranged from +0.146 to +2.228 t CH4 d-1, and from -15 to +224 t CO2 d-1. Degassing fluxes represented an important term of these budgets. A significant correlation was observed between the magnitude of CO2 diffusive fluxes and the water pH (R2 = 0.81; p &lt; 0.0001).

CeO2 is a highly effective promoter for In-ZSM-5 in dry feed (e.g., X(NO)&gt;70% at 100,000 h-1 between 723 and 773 K with 1000 ppm NO, 1000 ppm CH 4, and 2% O2) whereas in moist feed, the promotional effect is pronounced only at high temperatures. The role of CeO2 in the reaction mechanism is to provide a sufficient NO2 supply on the basis of its high NO oxidation activity. Under catalytic conditions, CeO 2 undergoes interaction with the zeolite component, which stabilizes part of the Ce ions in the +3 state in an oxidative atmosphere while the majority of Ce ions remain in the CeO2 lattice. This effect does not appear to be constitutive for the catalytic function of the CeO2 promoter. In-ZSM-5 catalysts with different active site structures exhibit different responses to promotion by ceria. Intrazeolite indium oxo species, which are often considered the most important active sites in In-ZSM-5 SCR catalysts, are not among the most favorable cases upon promotion with CeO 2. Intense promotional effects are found with sites that catalyze unselective methane oxidation in the absence of CeO2 (intrazeolite InOxCly species, extrazeolite In2O3 aggregates, probably active at the borderline with the zeolite). Ternary mechanical mixtures of CeO2, In(OH)3, and NH 4-ZSM-5 also exhibit high SCR activities provided that activation is performed in a nonoxidizing atmosphere. TPR, FTIR, XRD data, and results of experiments with separate activation of mixture components suggest that the favorable performance of these mixtures arises from extrazeolite indium sites, which are probably at the borderline between In2O3 aggregates and external zeolite surface and are possibly engaged in In-O-Si and In-O-Al bridges. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

The influence of sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) remote from the tropical Pacific but teleconnected with ENSO is investigated. Composite cycles of El Niño and La Niña SSTs are created and imposed on HadAM3. These SSTs are imposed in different areas, with climatological SSTs elsewhere, in order to find the influences of SSTs in different regions. It is found that most of the reproducible response to ENSO is forced directly from the tropical Pacific before the peak of the event. However, during the peak and decay of ENSO, remote SSTs become increasingly influential throughout the tropics (at the 98% significance level). This could lead to extended ENSO-related predictability due to the memory of the remote oceans. The Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent SSTs are found to be particularly influential. Indian Ocean SSTAs dampen the teleconnections from the tropical Pacific and force the atmosphere above the tropical Atlantic. More generally, when a tropical SSTA is imposed, atmospheric anomalies are forced locally with anomalies of the opposite sign to the west. Some of the reproducible response to ENSO in the tropical Atlantic is forced, not directly from the tropical Pacific but from the Indian ocean, which in turn is forced by the tropical Pacific. Subsequently, delayed SSTAs in the tropical Atlantic damp the local response and force the atmosphere Above the tropical Pacific in the opposite manner. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"air-sea interaction; atmospheric general circulation model; climate modeling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; sea surface temperature; seasonality; teleconnection; Atlantic Ocean; Indian Ocean; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942572636

Production of Lac and oxidation of 2,6-dimethoxyphenol (DMP) in the presence and absence of Mn2+ were detected both in submerged fermentation (SF) of dry ground mandarine peels and in solid-state fermentation (SSF) of grapevine sawdust in all investigated Pleurotus species and strains.

Most of the species and strains had higher Lac activity under SSF conditions than under SF conditions. DMP oxidation in the presence and absence of Mn2+ was detected in all investigated species and strains, but was lower under SF conditions than under SSF conditions for most of them. However, relative activities of DMP oxidation in the absence of Mn2+, as percentages of activity against DMP in the presence of Mn2+, were higher under conditions of SF than in SSF cultures in most of the investigated species and strains. The obtained results showed that strains of different origins have different efficiently ligninolytic systems and that conditions of SSF are more favorable for ligninolytic activity than those in SF owing to their similarity to natural conditions on wood substrates.","Laccase; Manganese peroxidase; Pleurotus; Solid-state fermentation; Submerged fermentation; Versatile peroxidase","carbon; laccase; manganese; manganese peroxidase; peroxidase; phenol derivative; article; carbon source; culture medium; enzyme activity; enzyme degradation; enzyme release; enzyme synthesis; grape; mandarin; oxidation; plant product; Pleurotus; sawdust; solid state fermentation; species cultivation; submerged fermentation; Pleurotus; Pleurotus; Vitis; Vitis sp.",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344686846

We aimed to evaluate one-carbon flux rates of methionine and homocysteine (Hcy) in ESRD patients and healthy controls. Transmethylation (TM), remethylation (RM), and transsulfuration (TS), as well as Hcy clearance by TS (i.e., TS/plasma total Hcy concentration) and by RM (i.e., RM/plasma total Hcy concentration) were evaluated in relation to body composition, vitamins, and S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) and S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet) levels. After a fixed protein diet for 3 days, primed-continuous infusion of [ 2H3-methyl-1-13C]methionine was performed in the postabsorptive state in 12 hemodialysis patients and 16 healthy volunteers. Hcy clearance by TS (-80%, P &lt; 0.001) and by RM (-77%, P &lt; 0.001) in ESRD patients was decreased compared with healthy controls. The absolute flux rates of TM (-27%, P &lt; 0.01) and RM (-28%, P = 0.02) were lower in the ESRD patients. After adjustment for age, TS was not significantly reduced. Whole blood AdoHcy was significantly elevated in ESRD and was a significant determinant of TM (standardized β = -1.24, P = 0.01) and RM (standardized β = -1.43, P = 0.03). In conclusion, patients with ESRD have impaired Hcy clearance by TS and RM. Elevated whole blood AdoHcy levels are associated with impaired RM and TM flux rates in these patients, and AdoHcy may be a key regulatory compound in one-carbon flux.","Remethylation; S-adenosylmethionine; Stable isotopes; Transmethylation; Transsulfuration","adenosylhomocysteinase; carbon; homocysteine; methionine; s adenosylhomocysteine; s adenosylmethionine; vitamin; adult; aged; article; body composition; carbon cycle; cardiovascular disease; chemical reaction; clinical article; controlled study; female; hemodialysis; human; hyperhomocysteinemia; kidney failure; male; methylation; priority journal; protein diet; remethylation; risk factor; sulfuration; Adult; Aged; Case-Control Studies; Female; Homocysteine; Humans; Kidney Failure, Chronic; Male; Methylation; Middle Aged; S-Adenosylhomocysteine; S-Adenosylmethionine; Sulfur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3242734035

Using the hamster, we have also described a sperm protein, P26h, which is acquired by spermatozoa during epididymal transit. Both P34H and P26h belong to the carbonyl reductase family. Using molecular tools derived from P34H, we searched in the hamster epididymis for another protein related to the human sperm protein. Cloning and sequencing of P31h cDNA revealed 100% homology with the kidney DCXR (Dicarbonyl/L-Xylulose reductase). Northern Blot experiments revealed a single mRNA that was more expressed in the caput than in the corpus and cauda segment of adult epididymides. In situ hybridization was performed on sexually mature hamsters showing that the mRNA was localized in the principal cells throughout the epididymis. Using an anti-P34H antibody we have identified a P34H related protein named P31h (for 31 kDa). This protein showed 2D-electrophoretic behavior different from P26h and was detectable all along the epididymis (caput, corpus, and cauda) by Western Blot analysis. Immunohistochemistry techniques showed that P31h was localized in the perinuclear region of the principal cells of the epididymal epithelium within the three sections, both in sexually mature and immature animals. Results are discussed with regards to the potential function of DCXR in the epididymis.","Epididymis; Gene expression; Hamster; Sperm maturation","amino acid; antibody; carbonyl reductase; complementary DNA; messenger RNA; nucleic acid; oxidoreductase; protein; sperm protein; unclassified drug; xylulose reductase; amino acid sequence; animal tissue; article; DNA sequence; epididymis; gene expression; hamster; immunohistochemistry; immunolocalization; in situ hybridization; male; molecular cloning; nonhuman; Northern blotting; nucleotide sequence; priority journal; reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction; sequence homology; spermatozoon maturation; two dimensional gel electrophoresis; Western blotting; Alcohol Oxidoreductases; Amino Acid Sequence; Animals; Blotting, Northern; Cell Adhesion Molecules; Cricetinae; Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; Epididymis; In Situ Hybridization; Male; Mesocricetus; Molecular Sequence Data; RNA, Messenger; Sugar Alcohol Dehydrogenases; Animalia; Cricetinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444303521

The emphasisof guidance and regulations has tended to be on providing illuminanceuniformity, yet many spaces do not need such strict control, positively benefiting from the stimulation induced by variety in the quantity and quality of light. Natural light is, however, neither a constant nor necessarily a constantly varying resource. In the search for diversity its quality and dynamic variability, dependent on latitude and local climatic factors, need to be taken into account. This chapter describes by way of some well-known building case studies a series of considerations that demonstrate the relevance and richness, both climatic and experiential, of strategies promoting lighting diversity in architecture. These strategies range from those that respond to patterns of movement (spatial and solar), through those that manipulate the transmission of light, to those that exploit differences in the specularity of surface finishes. A specific focus on the use of materials and their visual characteristics in Terragni’s Casa del Fascio in Como provides a clear demonstration of the specific and conscious role played by luminous diversity in shaping our experience of architecture. © 2004 Selection and editorial matter: Koen Steemers and Mary Ann Steane; individual chapters: The contributors.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85082891770

The analysis integrates several dominant approaches to the study of risk perception: psychometric approaches that examine the effects of cognitive structure; demographic assessments that examine, for example, differences in perception based on gender or family status; and political approaches that suggest that one's position in the policy process may affect his or her perceived risk. Attitudes toward climate change are to a degree predicted by all of these factors, but only when indirect effects are observed. Sociodemographic characteristics have little direct effect on perceived risk, but do affect general beliefs that affect risk perceptions. Perceived risk isrelated more strongly to these general beliefs or world views than to more specific beliefs about the effects of climate change on weather patterns. Position within the policy process also contributes to our understanding of perceptions, with industry and governmental actors demonstrating similar attitudes, which contrast with environmental groups and university researchers.","Climate change; Policy makers; Risk perceptions","Climate change; Public policy; Public risks; Risk perception; Social aspects; Policy making; Sociodemographic effects; Risk assessment; climate change; environmental policy; prairie; public attitude; risk perception; Canada; climate change; cognition; demography; family; gender; health care policy; politics; psychometry; review; risk assessment; Canada; North America; Western Hemisphere; World",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8844230325

The analysis of time-series from this dataset reveals, for the years 1982-2001, strong seasonal, and interannual variability in European land surface vegetation state. Phenological metrics indicate a late and short growing season for the years 1985-1987, in addition to early and prolonged activity in the years 1989, 1990, 1994 and 1995. These variations are in close agreement with findings from phenological measurements at the surface; spring phenology is also shown to correlate particularly well with anomalies in winter temperature and winter North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index. Nevertheless, phenological metrics, which display considerable regional differences, could only be determined for vegetation with a seasonal behaviour.

At the core of this interplay is the normative consistency of trade-related rules in the two regimes and any hierarchical relationship between them. The stronger clout of the WTO and its compulsory dispute settlement system suggest that issues involving competing claims would be referred to WTO bodies. Such bodies have so far been restrictive regarding the exceptions in WTO agreements to the general ban on embargoes and discrimination. The normative compatibility of the two regimes will also depend on their participatory interplay, specifically how they differentiate groups of actors as to rights and obligations. Non-members of WTO receive the least protection, and their vulnerability to climate-related trade measures is largely determined by their interdependence with states that consider employment of such measures. Among WTO members, the findings of a dispute settlement body would presumably differ depending on the status of the target under the Kyoto Protocol. A non-complier with Kyoto commitments would be more shielded than a non-party, because by joining the Kyoto regime a non-complier has exposed itself to regime-internal and less trade intrusive measures that should be exhausted first. A third dimension of interplay is linkage, or efforts to influence the regime interplay. To date there has only been moderate cross-agency coordination, but considerable attention is paid within each regime, including in the Millennium Round of trade negotiations, to the desirability of avoiding conflict between them.","Climate politics; Compliance; Institutional interplay; Interaction; International regimes; Kyoto Protocol; Trade measures; World Trade Organization (WTO)","climate change; international agreement; international trade; Kyoto Protocol; trade-environment relations; World Trade Organization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13644281066

Natl., New York, NY, United States","The ice-covered Earth instability found in energy balance models is studied with a zonal mean statistical dynamical atmospheric model coupled to a global mixed layer ocean model. The response of the model to changes in solar constant is examined in two parallel studies, one with and one without a fixed meridional heat transport (a Q-flux) being included in the ocean model. The Q-flux is derived so as to make the climate with the current value of the solar constant resemble the earth's current climate. In both cases the climate displays a hysteresis loop as the solar constant decreases and then increases, with two equilibrium states being possible for a range of values of the solar constant. In the case without a Q-flux, as in energy balance models, one state corresponds to an ice-covered Earth, and the other is partially covered. In the case with a Q-flux, because the poleward Q-flux is stronger in the Southern Hemisphere, one state corresponds to an ice-covered Northern Hemisphere, but a Southern Hemisphere that is only partially ice-covered; the other state has much reduced ice-cover in both hemispheres. In the case when the Q-flux is present, the sensitivity of the state with smaller ice-cover is about half as much, and the hysteresis loop extends over a smaller range of values of the solar constant. Also in this case there is a strong ice-covered Earth instability that sets in when the solar constant is about 13-14% below the current value. However in the case without a Q-flux the ice-covered Earth instability virtually disappears. The different behavior is attributed to the much lower efficiency of the meridional heat transport in the case with no Q-flux. The behavior in this case may be more realistic for cold climates. The results in both cases confirm the simple analytical relation between global mean surface temperature and global ice area found in energy balance models. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"atmosphere-ice-ocean system; energy balance; global perspective; heat transfer; ice cover; surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3843150728

It is a metamorphic, dense and durable stone, but like other stones, it is occasionally subject to severe weathering. This paper gives an overview of the core issues related to outdoor soapstone weathering in Norway and shows how the weathering has changed over time. First, objects that evidently weathered quite strongly during the Little Ice Age (14th-19th century), especially in the countryside, have now been relatively stable for a hundred years or more. Although a multitude of weathering processes might have been active, this could point to a higher frequency of damaging frost events in the Little Ice Age than at present. In the case of former ruins, the present stable condition might also be related to good roofing and less moisture in the masonry. Second, the weathering was in complex ways, often governed by changes in architectural design, influenced by air pollution in the cities from the late 19th century until the recent drastic reductions in SO2 emissions. Third, alkaline salts from Portland cement, sulfate from air pollution and some stones, as well as chloride from acid cleaning, greatly enhanced the salt load at many monuments in the 19th and 20th centuries, giving rise to severe weathering, especially at places where water leaks and damaging run-off have prevailed. This situation obviously continues to be problematic. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

Methanotrophs play a very important role in decreasing landfill site methane emissions. We investigated the methane oxidation capacity and methanotroph diversity in lysimeters simulating landfill sites with different plant vegetations. Methane oxidation rates were 35 g methane m-2 day -1 or higher for planted lysimeters and 18 g methane m-2 day-1 or less for bare soil controls. Best methane oxidation, as displayed by gas depth profiles, was found under a vegetation of grass and alfalfa. Methanotroph communities were analysed at high throughput and resolution using a microbial diagnostic microarray targeting the particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) gene of methanotrophs and functionally related bacteria. Members of the genera Methylocystis and Methylocaldum were found to be the dominant members in landfill site simulating lysimeters. Soil bacterial communities in biogas free control lysimeters, which were less abundant in methanotrophs, were dominated by Methylocaldum. Type la methanotrophs were found only in the top layers of bare soil lysimeters with relatively high oxygen and low methane concentrations. A competetive advantage of type II methanotrophs over type la methanotrophs was indicated under all plant covers investigated. Analysis of average and individual results from parallel samples was used to identify general trends and variations in methanotroph community structures in relation to depth, methane supply and plant cover. The applicability of the technology for the detection of environmental perturbations was proven by an erroneous result, where an unexpected community composition detected with the microarray indicated a potential gas leakage in the lysimeter being investigated.",,"methane; article; classification; DNA microarray; DNA sequence; ecosystem; evaluation; genetics; metabolism; Methanococcales; microbiology; molecular genetics; nucleotide sequence; oxidation reduction reaction; phylogeny; plant; waste disposal; Base Sequence; Ecosystem; Methane; Methanococcales; Molecular Sequence Data; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oxidation-Reduction; Phylogeny; Plants; Refuse Disposal; Sequence Analysis, DNA; Soil Microbiology; Bacteria (microorganisms); Medicago sativa; Methanococcales; Methylocaldum; Methylocystaceae; Methylocystis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842509942

The heats of reactions evolved during coal devolatilisation were determined by computational calorimetry and compared with the evolution rate of fourteen volatile species. The devolatilisation was classified into five major regions of thermal activity, according to the analysis, where the first was related to the dehydration of strongly bounded water. The second was the pre-plastic region with an endothermic prepyrolytic reaction, while the third was the exothermic plastic range with primarily evolution of tars and re-solidification reactions. The secondary devolatilisation was found to be endothermic and the major contributors were hydrocarbons, secondary water, CS2 and H 2S. The largest reaction was the contraction of carbon planes with evolution of hydrogen. Each reaction region was assumed to follow the first-order Arrhenius kinetic correlation and the activation energy was determined for each of the five regions. The activation energies were then incorporated into a simplified model for predicting the overall heats of reactions. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The X-ray observations make use of the unprecedented spatial resolution of the Chandra X-ray observatory to more robustly than before remove X-ray emission from point sources and hence obtain the X-ray properties of the diffuse thermal emission alone. We have combined the X-ray observations with existing, comparable-resolution, ground-based Hα and R-band imaging and present a mini-atlas of images on a common spatial and surface brightness scale to aid cross-comparison. In general, the morphology of the extraplanar diffuse X-ray emission is very similar to the extraplanar Hα filaments and arcs, on both small and large scales (scales of tens of parsecs and kiloparsecs, respectively). The most spectacular cases of this are found in NGC 1482 (for which we provide the first published X-ray observation) and NGC 3079. We provide a variety of quantitative measures of how the spectral hardness and surface brightness of the diffuse X-ray emission varies with increasing height z above the plane of each galaxy. Of the eight galaxies in which diffuse X-ray emitting halos are found (the starbursts and the normal spiral NGC 891), significant spatial variation in the spectral properties of the extraplanar emission (|z| ≥ 2 kpc) is only found in two cases: NGC 3628 and NGC 4631. In general, the vertical distribution of the halo-region X-ray surface brightness is best described as an exponential, with the observed scale heights of the sample galaxies lying in the range H eff ∼ 2-4 kpc. The presence of extraplanar X-ray emission is always associated with the presence of extraplanar optical line emission of similar vertical extent. No X-ray emission was detected from the halos of the two low-mass normal spiral galaxies NGC 6503 and NGC 4244. Active galactic nuclei, where present, appear to play no role in powering or shaping the outflows from the starburst galaxies in this sample. The Chandra ACIS X-ray spectra of extraplanar emission from all these galaxies can be fitted with a common two-temperature spectral model with an enhanced α-to-iron element ratio. This is consistent with the origin of the X-ray emitting gas being either metal-enriched merged SN ejecta or shock-heated ambient halo or disk material with moderate levels of metal depletion onto dust. Our favored model is that SN feedback in the disks of star-forming galaxies create, via blow-out and venting of hot gas from the disk, tenuous exponential atmospheres of density scale height H g ∼ 4-8 kpc. The soft thermal X-ray emission observed in the halos of the starburst galaxies is either this preexisting halo medium, which has been swept up and shock-heated by the starburst-driven wind, or wind material compressed near the walls of the outflow by reverse shocks within the wind. In either case, the X-ray emission provides us with a powerful probe of the properties of gaseous halos around star-forming disk galaxies.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442463418

A set of regions sampling the whole sky is chosen to provide a comprehensive range of tests. The range of EGRET data used is extended to 100 GeV. The models are computed with our GALPROP cosmic-ray propagation and γ-ray production code. We confirm that the ""conventional model"" based on the locally observed electron and nucleon spectra is inadequate, for all sky regions. A conventional model plus hard sources in the inner Galaxy is also inadequate, since this cannot explain the GeV excess away from the Galactic plane. Models with a hard electron injection spectrum are inconsistent with the local spectrum even considering the expected fluctuations; they are also inconsistent with the EGRET data above 10 GeV. We present a new model that fits the spectrum in all sky regions adequately. Secondary antiproton data were used to fix the Galactic average proton spectrum, while the electron spectrum is adjusted using the spectrum of diffuse emission itself. The derived electron and proton spectra are compatible with those measured locally considering fluctuations due to energy losses, propagation, or possibly details of Galactic structure. This model requires a much less dramatic variation in the electron spectrum than models with a hard electron injection spectrum, and moreover it fits the γ-ray spectrum better and to the highest EGRET energies.

Efforts to model structural and/or functional features of the protein-bound clusters have prompted the preparation and study of complexes that contain Fe(μ-O(H))2Fe cores. Here we report the structures and spectroscopic properties of a family of diiron complexes with the same tetradentate N4 ligand in one ligand topology, namely [(α-BPMCN) 2FeII2(μ-OH)2](CF 3SO3)2 (1), [(α-BPMCN)2Fe IIFeIII(μ-OH)2](CF3SO 3)3 (2), and [(α-BPMCN)2Fe III2(μ-O)(μ-OH)](CF3SO3) 3 (3) (BPMCN = N,N′-dimethyl-N,N′ -bis(2-pyridylmethyl)-trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane). Stepwise one-electron oxidations of 1 to 2 and then to 3 demonstrate the versatility of the Fe(μ-O(H))2Fe diamond core to support a number of oxidation states with little structural rearrangement. Insight into the electronic structure of 1, 2′, and 3 has been obtained from a detailed Mössbauer investigation (2′ differs from 2 in having a different complement of counterions). Mixed-valence complex 2′ is ferromagnetically coupled, with J = -15 ± 5 cm-1 (H = JS1· S2). For the S = 9/2 ground multiplet we have determined the zero-field splitting parameter, D9/2 = -1.5 ± 0.1 cm -1, and the hyperfine parameters of the ferric and ferrous sites. For T &lt; 12 K, the S = 9/2 multiplet has uncommon relaxation behavior. Thus, Ms = -9/2 ↔ Ms = +9/2 ground state transition is slow while ΔM s = ±1 transitions between equally signed Ms levels are fast on the time scale of Mössbauer spectroscopy. Below 100 K, complex 2′ is trapped in the Fe1IIIFe2II ground state; above this temperature, it exhibits thermally assisted electron hopping into the state Fe1IIFe2III. The temperature dependence of the isomer shifts was corrected for second-order Doppler shift, obtained from the study of diferrous 1. The resultant true shifts were analyzed in a two-state hopping model. The diferric complex 3 is antiferromagnetically coupled with J = 90 ± 15 cm-1, estimated from a variable-temperature Mössbauer analysis.",,"acyl coenzyme A desaturase; carboxyl group; cyclohexane derivative; ferric ion; ferromagnetic material; ferrous ion; hydroxyl group; iron complex; ligand; methane monooxygenase; n,n' dimethyl n,n' bis(2 pyridylmethyl) 1,2 diaminocyclohexane; ribonucleotide reductase; unclassified drug; article; chemical analysis; chemical bond; chemical interaction; chemical model; chemical structure; conformational transition; crystal structure; electron transport; enzyme activity; enzyme structure; isomer; Mossbauer spectroscopy; oxidation; parameter; protein binding; structure analysis; synthesis; temperature dependence; Binding Sites; Crystallography, X-Ray; Fatty Acid Desaturases; Ferric Compounds; Ferrous Compounds; Hydroxides; Iron; Kinetics; Ligands; Models, Molecular; Organometallic Compounds; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxygen; Oxygenases; Ribonucleotide Reductases; Spectroscopy, Mossbauer; Thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442515296

However, little is known about the constraints and parameters for using PET signal detection to establish cell numbers in regions of interest. In this study, we determined the correlation of PET signal to cell number, and characterized the cellular limit of detection for PET imaging. Procedures: Cells expressing the herpes simplex virus type I thymidine kinase PET reporter gene (HSV1-sr39TK) were detected following accumulation of [18F]FHBG (9-[4-[18F] -fluoro-3-(hydroxymethyl) butyl]guanine) by microPET scanning and quantitation. Results: When cells were cultured with [18F]FHBG in vitro, and then transferred to a model vascularized site, 73% retention was observed one hour post-transfer. Using this information, and the measured attenuation of PET signal in whole mouse scans, we assessed the per-cell uptake of [18F]FHBG in the vascularized site following standard parenteral administration of the substrate. We observed a cell number-dependent signal, with a limit of detection calculated as 106 cells in a region of interest of 0.1 mL volume. Quantitatively similar parameters were observed with stably tranfected N2a glioma cells and retrovirally transduced primary T lymphocytes. Conclusion: These methods and findings provide a strategy for quantitation of cellularity using PET imaging that has implications for both experimental models and clinical diagnosis. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

We focused our study on clarifying the regulating factors of soil carbon evolution under the lowest moisture conditions by conducting laboratory experiments under precisely controlled conditions. Nanoscale porosity and surface properties of these soils were determined to analyze the role of residual water in the carbon evolution processes in dry soils. Laboratory incubation showed that the carbon evolution from a microporous (D &lt; 2 n m) volcanic soil proceeded even at -100 U kg-1 water potential (INT) in contrast to the carbon evolution from a phyllosilicate alluvial soil. Pore-size estimation and 1H-NMR spectroscopy showed that the carbon evolution at -100 U kg-1 WP proceeded through the utilization of nanopore-water in soils. Batch sorption experiment suggested that the surface affinity of the soils to dissolved organic matter (DOM) had enhanced carbon evolution by attracting DOM into hydrophilic spheres of the soil at -100 U kg-1 MT. Solid-state IIGNMR of organic matter samples (incubated in the absence of soils) suggested that the chemical alteration of the samples was significant for aliphatic components, while the alteration was not observed in the samples incubated at -100 U kg-1 WP. This fact also indicated the contribution of nanoscale pores in the volcanic components to carbon evolution. Application of the experimental results to several biogeochemical models revealed that both volumetric water content and MT are required to estimate carbon evolution under low moisture conditions. A micro habitat model showed that the carbon evolution at -100 U kg-1 WP could be attributed to extracellular enzymatic processes or other abiotic processes rather than to the activities of living microorganisms. © 2004 Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.","Carbon evolution; Desertification; Microhabitat; Soil nanopores; Water potential",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11044231060

To further understand the mechanism of atmospheric temperature and precipitation changes associated with the greenhouse gas increase, a numerical experiment was conducted using an atmospheric general circulation model to investigate the separate effects of CO2 increase and sea surface temperature (SST) increase. It has been shown that the effect of CO2 increase is a reduction of radiative cooling in the lower troposphere, leading to a reduction of tropical precipitation. When atmospheric CO2 concentration is doubled (quadrupled) without changing the SST, the tropical precipitation is reduced by about 3% (6%) in the model. The reduction of radiative cooling is a result of the overlap effect of the CO2 15-μm and water vapor absorption bands. On the other hand, the effect of SST increase is the increase in atmospheric temperature and water vapor, leading to increases in radiative cooling and tropical precipitation. When SST is uniformly raised 2°C without changing the atmospheric CO2 concentration, the tropical precipitation is increased by about 6%.",,"Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse effect; Mathematical models; Troposphere; Radiative cooling; Sea surface temperature (SST); Precipitation (meteorology); atmospheric general circulation model; carbon dioxide enrichment; climate change; precipitation (climatology); tropical region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442315661

In the simulations, positive and negative surface temperature biases of 2°-4°C occurred systematically over north China and Mongolia. The model also produced excessive precipitation over land but less precipitation over the southern ocean of the model domain. In this study, impacts of land cover changes (LCC) on the systematic biases were investigated through the cool/wet and warm/dry summer climate simulations using two types of land cover maps using RegCM2. One type was an NCAR land cover map, and the other was a current land cover map derived from satellite data. Simulated latent heat flux and wind speed increased noticeably over central and north China, where deciduous broad leaf trees have been replaced by mixed farm and irrigated crop. As a result, the systematic positive biases over central and north China were greatly reduced regardless of climate regimes. Cooling in central and north China resulted in a pressure gradient decrease between the east Asian continent and the Pacific Ocean. The decrease in pressure gradient suppressed northward transport of moisture from south China and the South China Sea. The change reduced not only excessive precipitation over north China and Mongolia but also less precipitation over south China. However, in LCC, precipitation increased in the Korean Peninsula and the Japan Islands, in particular, during July and August. As a result, LCC resulted in cooler and drier summer climate over north China, but cooler and wetter summer climate over the Korean Peninsula and the Japan Islands irrespective of climate regimes. In general, the impacts of LCC were relatively significant in the warm and dry summer.

This paper presents the effects of the mass fraction of a model MSW in the fuel mixture, as against 100% lignite, on the combustion characteristics that may be inferred from temperature distributions, carbon combustion efficiency and CO and CO2 concentrations and on the emissions of major gaseous pollutants, including CO, SO2, NO and N2O. The influence of excess air and secondary air on those characteristics are also discussed. The results show that within the 40% MSW fraction tested, co-combustion is characterized by enhanced combustion of volatiles in the freeboard, a lower bed temperature and a combustion efficiency drop of up to 8%. Co-combustion either increases or reduces CO emission depending on the percentage of excess air. Reduction of up to 7-18% of SO2 is observed at the 40% MSW fraction for the range of excess air and secondary air tested. Both NO and N 2O increase slightly with increasing fraction of MSW. Within the range of experimental conditions tested, the optimum condition for co-combustion in view of combustion efficiency and CO, NO and N2O emissions is: 20% MSW, 40% excess air and 0.2 secondary to total ratio, although the reduction of SO2 is slightly smaller than at other conditions. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

With the increasing stringency of emissions regulations, new effective diesel emission control systems are needed for in-use and new diesels vehicles. In order to improve SPM levels in the urban areas of Japan, most local governments are considering new legislation. This legislation will require old in-use diesel vehicles to be retrofitted with a PM reduction device, such as a DOC (Diesel Oxidation Catalyst), DPF (Diesel Particulate Filter) or CRT™ (Continuously Regenerating Technology). The CRT™ (Continuously Regenerating Technology) system is an effective device for reduction of PM from in-use diesels. The CRT™ consists of a DOC and a particulate filter which is conventionally a wall-through filter. In the present, more than 30,000 vehicles worldwide are operating with this device. However, due to the lower NOx/PM ratio from Japanese in-use diesels, only a limited number of vehicles can be equipped with this conventional system. Improvement is necessary for the vehicle with low NOx/PM ratio. A new PM emission control device which consists of a DOC and an unique Catalysed Soot Filter (CSF) capable of dealing with the lower NOx/PM ratio has been developed for retrofit application.

This study presents sediment core data from a macrotidal estuary located at the mouth of the Bay of Fundy showing stratigraphic profiles of total and methylmercury concentrations and potential methylation rates measured using stable mercury isotopes. The results show that in contrast to the expected methylmercury profile typically observed in unmixed sediments, methylmercury production occurs throughout the estimated 15-cm-thick active surface layer of these well-mixed sediments. The resulting large reservoir of methylmercury in these sediments helps to explain why mercury concentrations in organisms in this system remain high despite emissions reductions. Current management policies should take into account the expected delay in the response time of well-mixed estuarine systems to declines in mercury loading, considering the greater reservoir of historic mercury available in these sediments that can potentially be converted to methylmercury and biomagnify in coastal food chains. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

During a measuring campaign around the City of Augsburg (Southern Germany) in May 2001 modelling calculations were performed, including a scenario in which the highway emissions (ca. 80,000 vehicles/day) between Munich and Augsburg (distance ca. 40 km) were switched off. Based on the change in emissions, the variations in O 3- and NOx-concentrations as well as the size of the influenced area within the region of interest are discussed. Additionally, an episode in August 2001 with elevated ozone values was modelled for comparison with the May episode. The model results show a very pronounced reduction of O3- and an increase of NO2-concentrations after passing the highway within a distance of more than 40 km. After turning off the highway emissions it could be demonstrated that the emission reduction causes a significant increase in the ozone levels downwind of the highway in the magnitude of 10-20 ppbv depending on the time of the day. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The local magnitude of emissions therefore depends on livestock density, type, and management, with major differences occurring in various parts of Scotland. Local differences in agricultural activities therefore result in a wide range of NH3 emissions, ranging from less than 0.2 kg N ha(-1) year(-1) in remote areas of the Scottish Highlands to over 100 kg N ha(-1) year-1 in areas with intensive poultry farming. Scotland can be divided loosely into upland and lowland areas, with NH3 emission being less than and more than 5 kg N ha(-1) year(-1), respectively. Many semi-natural ecosystems in Scotland are vulnerable to nitrogen deposition, including bogs, moorlands, and the woodland ground flora. Because NH3 emissions occur in the rural environment, the local deposition to sensitive ecosystems may be large, making it essential to assess the spatial distribution of NH3 emissions and deposition. A spatial model is applied here to map NH3 emissions and these estimates are applied in atmospheric dispersion and deposition models to estimate atmospheric concentrations of NH3 and NH4+, dry deposition of NH3, and wet deposition of NHx. Although there is a high level of local variability, modelled NH3 concentrations show good agreement with the National Ammonia Monitoring Network, while wet deposition is largest at high altitude sites in the south and west of Scotland. Comparison of the modelled NHx deposition fields with estimated thresholds for environmental effects (""critical loads"") shows that thresholds are exceeded across most of lowland Scotland and the Southern Uplands. Only in the cleanest parts of the north and west is nitrogen deposition not a cause for concern. Given that the most intense effects occur within a few kilometres of sources, it is suggested that local spatial abatement policies would be a useful complement to traditional policies that mitigate environmental effects based on emission reduction technologies.",,"ammonia; nitrogen; animal; article; domestic animal; environment; human; metabolism; United Kingdom; Ammonia; Animals; Animals, Domestic; Environment; Humans; Nitrogen; Scotland; MLCS; MLOWN",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28744455669

Several climate models predict that the intercontinental western United States will experience an increase in extreme precipitation events and warming temperatures. In 1996, northern Arizona, USA, experienced a 100-year drought that caused high local mortality of pinyon pine (Pinus edulis), a dominant tree of the southwest. We compared trunk growth, water potentials, and ectomycorrhizal dynamics for surviving trees at three high-mortality sites and adjacent low-mortality sites. Four major patterns emerged. First, surviving trees at sites that suffered high mortality exhibited reduced long-term growth and increased water stress relative to adjacent sites where little or no mortality occurred. Second, surviving trees from high-mortality sites had 50% lower ectomycorrhizal colonization and showed a pronounced shift in fungal community composition relative to low-mortality sites. Third, in support of an intermediate-host plant stress hypothesis, trees that experienced intermediate levels of stress supported two-fold greater ectomycorrhizal colonization than trees at the high or low end of a stress gradient. Fourth, we observed a strong correlation between trunk growth and ectomycorrhizal colonization and validated the resulting regression model with independent data. This relationship suggests that tree rings can be used to reconstruct past and predict future ectomycorrhizal colonization. Overall, our findings suggest that predicted climate changes might be accompanied by both qualitative and quantitative changes in ectomycorrhizal dynamics that could affect ecosystems by altering nutrient cycling, carbon dynamics, and host-plant performance.","Arizona, USA (northern); Climate-change effects; Community structure; Drought effects; Ectomycorrhizal fungi; Intermediate-host plant stress hypothesis; Pinus edulis; Tree rings predict ectomycorrizal colonization","climate change; community composition; drought; ectomycorrhiza; fungus; root colonization; tree ring; Arizona; North America; United States; Western Hemisphere; World; Fungi; Pinus edulis; Pinus edulis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7544232104

The abstraction level aimed for, however, may be too high to yield meaningful results. Many of the experiments on which evidence in favour or otherwise are based are artificial and do not support the bold generalisations to other spatial and temporal scales that are often made. Future investigations should utilise co-evolved communities, be structured to investigate the distinct roles of clearly defined functional groups, separate the effects of between- and within-group diversity and be conducted over a range of stress and disturbance situations. An integral part of agricultural intensification at the plot level is the deliberate reduction of diversity. This does not necessarily result in impairment of ecosystem services of direct relevance to the land user unless the hypothesised diversity-function threshold is breached by elimination of a key functional group or species. Key functions may also be substituted with petro-chemical energy in order to achieve perceived efficiencies in the production of specific goods. This can result in the maintenance of ecosystem services of importance to agricultural production at levels of biodiversity below the assumed 'functional threshold'. However, it can also result in impairment of other services and under some conditions the de-linking of the diversity-function relationship. Avoidance of these effects or attempts to restore non-essential ecosystem services are only likely to be made by land users at the plot scale if direct economic benefit can be thereby achieved. At the plot and farm scales biodiversity is unlikely to be maintained for purposes other than those of direct use or 'utilitarian' benefits and often at levels lower than those necessary for maintenance of many ecosystem services. The exceptions may be traditional systems where intrinsic values (social customs) continue to provide reasons for diversity maintenance. High levels of biodiversity in managed landscapes are more likely to be maintained for reasons of intrinsic, serependic ('option' or 'bequest') values or utilitarian ('direct use') than for functional or ecosystem service values. The major opportunity for both maintaining ecosystem services and biodiversity outside conservation areas lies in promoting diversity of land-use at the landscape and farm rather than field scale. This requires, however, an economic and policy climate that favours diversification in land uses and diversity among land users. © 2004 Published by Elsevier B.V.","Agricultural landscapes; Biodiversity; Ecosystem services; Functional groups; Resilience","agricultural land; biodiversity; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; strategic approach",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4744341462

Little Bldg., Ann Arbor, MI 48109, United States","Physiochemical controls on the carbonate geochemistry of large river systems are important regulators of carbon exchange between terrestrial and marine reservoirs on human time scales. Although many studies have focused on large-scale river carbon fluxes, there are few investigations of mechanistic aspects of carbonate mass balance and transport at the catchment scale. We determined elemental and carbonate geochemistry and mass balances for net carbonate dissolution fluxes from the forested, mid-latitude Huron River watershed, established on carbonate-rich unconfined glacial drift aquifers. Shallow groundwaters are near equilibrium with respect to calcite at pCO2 values up to 25 times atmospheric values. Surface waters are largely groundwater fed and exhibit chemical evolution due to CO2 degassing, carbonate precipitation in lakes and wetlands, and anthropogenic introduction of road salts (NaCl and CaCl2). Because the source groundwater Mg2+/HCO3- ratio is fairly constant, this parameter permits mass balances to be made between carbonate dissolution and back precipitation after groundwater discharge. Typically, precipitation does not occur until IAP/K calcite values exceed 10 times supersaturation. Stream chemistry changes little thereafter even though streams remain highly supersaturated for calcite. Our data taken together with historical United States Geological Survey (USGS) data show that alkalinity losses to carbonate precipitation are most significant during periods of lowest discharge. Thus, on an annual basis, the large carbon flux from carbonate dissolution in soil zones is only decreased by a relatively small amount by the back precipitation of calcium carbonate. © 2004 Kluwer Academic Publishers.","Alkalinity; Calcite saturation; Carbon; Michigan; Rivers","carbonate; catchment; mass transport; precipitation (chemistry); river system; Michigan; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444254475

Model results were evaluated using independent, high time resolution measurements of aerosol nitrate. The mean observed concentration in July was 0.6 μg/m3 and 2.1 μg/m 3 in January. Model predictions were in agreement with the observations within 0.5 μg/m3 on average, with measurement uncertainties often accounting for these discrepancies. The simulations were run assuming particles were liquid in July for all relative humidities (RHs) and solid below 60% RH in January. For both seasons the assumed physical state did not influence considerably the overall agreement with observations. The assumption of particle mixing state did appear to influence model error; however, assuming that particles were externally mixed during low RH periods in July improved agreement significantly. The exceptional sensitivity of predicted aerosol nitrate to ammonia in western Pennsylvania suggests that reductions in PM2.5 may be assisted by reductions in ammonia emissions.

Treatment of oxidized cytochrome b561 with diethylpyrocarbonate caused a downshift of midpoint potential for the lower component, and this shift was prevented by the presence of ascorbate during the treatment. Present EPR analyses showed that, upon the treatment, the gz = 3.69 heme species was converted to a non-ascorbate-reducible form, although its g z-value showed no appreciable change. The treatment had no effect on the other heme (the gz = 3.13 species). Raman data indicated that the two heme b centers adopt a six-coordinated low-spin state, in both the reduced and oxidized forms. There was no significant effect of diethylpyrocarbonate-treatment on the Raman spectra of either form, but the reducibility by ascorbate differed significantly between the two hemes upon the treatment. The addition of ferrocyanide enhanced both the reduction rate and final reduction level of the diethylpyrocarbonate-treated cytochrome b 561 when ascorbate was used as a reductant. This observation suggests that ferrocyanide scavenges monodehydroascorbate radicals produced by the univalent oxidation of ascorbate and, thereby, increases both the reduction rate and the final reduction level of the heme center on the intravesicular side of the diethylpyrocarbonate-treated cytochrome. These results further clarify the physiological role of this heme center as the electron donor to the monodehydroascorbate radical.","Ascorbate; Cytochrome b561; EPR; Heme redox potential; Resonance Raman; Transmembrane electron transfer","ascorbic acid; cytochrome b; cytochrome b561; dopamine beta monooxygenase; ferrocyanide; heme; scavenger; unclassified drug; amidation; article; cattle; chromaffin cell; electron spin resonance; electron transport; enzyme assay; matrix assisted laser desorption ionization time of flight mass spectrometry; membrane vesicle; neurosecretory cell; nonhuman; oxidation reduction reaction; protein localization; Raman spectrometry; Animals; Ascorbic Acid; Cattle; Chromaffin Cells; Cytochrome b Group; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Heme; Oxidation-Reduction; Potentiometry; Spectrum Analysis, Raman; Bos taurus; Bovinae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642504227

A dual-source model is proposed linking ABA to diurnal stomatal movements. Darkness would favour guard cell biosynthesis of endogenous ABA and disfavour ABA catabolism. At first light, xanthophyll cycling, isomerization of ABA precursors, and activation of a cytochrome P450 mono-oxgenase (CytP450) would deplete endogenous guard cell ABA. The NADPH-requiring CytP450 would be activated by elevated O2 and reduced CO2 concentrations resulting from mesophyll photosynthesis. An increased O2-to-CO2 ratio would limit the Calvin cycle in guard cells, diverting NADPH produced by photosynthetic electron transport to the cytosol where, along with elevated O2, it would activate CytP450. Depletion of endogenous ABA would liberate guard cells to extrude protons and accumulate the ions and water needed to increase guard cell turgor and open stomata. By midday, stomata would be regulated by steady-state concentrations of ABA delivered to the apoplast around guard cells by transpiration. In temperate conditions, ABA would reach concentrations high enough to trigger ion efflux from guard cells, but too low to defeat the accumulation of sugars used to maintain opening. In dry conditions, ABA would reach effective concentrations by midday, high enough to trigger ion efflux and inhibit sugar uptake, reducing apertures for the rest of the day. At sunset, conditions would again favour biosynthesis and disfavour catabolism of endogenous guard cell ABA. The model can be used to reconcile proposed cellular mechanisms for guard cell signal transduction with patterns of stomatal movements in leaves.","ABA; Abscisic acid; Guard cells; Metabolism; Stomata","Acids; Cells; Concentration (process); Photosynthesis; Protons; Abscisic acids; Catabolism; Guard cells; Biosynthesis; abscisic acid; circadian rhythm; metabolism; physiology; plant physiology; review; Abscisic Acid; Circadian Rhythm; Plant Physiology",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544234231

This may limit the functionality and efficiency of the program, both in terms of convergence properties and ease of programming. TOUGH2 was adapted to allow for a general choice of independent (primary) variables. The changes to the code include increasing the size of the secondary parameter array for storage of pressure and changing the references to pressure in the flow equation module. Testing showed that the new code accurately replicates results of the original code. The program was applied to problems of relevance to geological storage of CO2 using the modified code (D-EOS), and the original code (P-EOS), as primary variables. Two scenarios, addition of heat and addition of mass, were simulated using both versions of TOUGH2. The simulations produced very similar results; however, in most instances, the density-based routine solved the problems faster and satisfied analytical constraints placed on the problems more accurately than the pressure-based runs. It was generally the case that the greater the modelled pressure gradients the better D-EOS performed. The new formulation adds flexibility to TOUGH2, both in terms of improved convergence behaviour and ease of programming. The new flexibility to choose any primary variables which uniquely specify the equilibrium state of a system allows for increased efficiencies in coding EOS routines, and may have important consequences in optimization of the solution of the flow equations for a given problem. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis refers to Calabria, a region situated in the south of Italy. Representative species are chosen for this study. The optimal harvesting age excluding social benefits varies between 32 and 40 years according to the species considered. When including social benefits, optimal harvesting age increases for a carbon price of 20 €/t to 34-44 years and is close to the one excluding them. The inclusion of subsidies to encourage afforestation shortens the optimal harvesting age to 17-20 years from the forest owner's point of view. Interestingly the provision of subsidies contributes to a substantial increase in social loss due to the differences in optimal harvesting ages: starting from zero C price the loss vary between 65 and 165 €/ha according to the species used and increases with rising carbon prices up to 200-400 €/ha for carbon price of 100 €/t. Furthermore, results suggest that from the social point of view the profitability of afforesting agricultural land in the study region very much depends on the price of carbon, on the type of agricultural land afforested and on the species used. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

For a period of ca. 5 months, two decomposer communities in litterbags (1000 and 45 μ mesh size) containing spruce litter were subjected to two irrigation treatments: constant and fluctuating (drying/rewetting) moisture conditions. The latter were expected to induce moisture stress on the decomposer communities. The two mesh sizes were used to exclude different faunal components from the decomposer communities. The 1000 μ mesh excluded only the macrofauna, whereas the 45 μm mesh excluded both the macro- and mesofauna. In the short-term perspective of the present study, mesofauna abundance showed no response to imposed fluctuating moisture conditions. Irrespective of the presence of mesofauna, mass loss, microbial biomass and the control mechanisms, regulating carbon mineralization appeared unaffected by fluctuating moisture conditions. The reduction in the functional/structural diversity of the decomposer communities in the 45 μm litterbags resulted in strongly increased Nematoda abundance but it did not alter the response of Nematoda to fluctuating moisture conditions. Processes in the nitrogen (N)-cycle and mass loss were sensitive indicators of changes in the structural and functional complexity of decomposer communities. However, a negative effect of fluctuating moisture conditions on extractable N was coupled to the presence of mesofauna. Extremes in rainfall patterns, generated by climate change, may have a negative impact on the availability of nutrients, particularly N, for plants. This effect could be amplified by an additional impoverishment in the structural and functional complexity of the respective decomposer communities. © 2004 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.","Functional diversity; Microbial biomass; Precipitation patterns; Soil fauna; Soil processes; Spruce litter","climate change; decomposition; moisture; precipitation (climatology); soil biota; Nematoda; Picea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4043083710

Four dissimilar modes of a new California test schedule were used to generate emission predictions for the US heavy-duty urban dynamometer driving schedule (UDDS). Intensive properties of each mode and of the UDDS, including average speed, stops/mile, percentage idle and average kinetic energy, were chosen for further study. The four dissimilar modes were the idle, creep, transient and cruise modes, created by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) in a prior effort. The predictive weightings were applied to emissions from 11 heavy-duty vehicles measured in units of grams/second (g/s), grams/litre of fuel consumed (g/1) and brake specific emissions (g/kW h). Predictions of emissions for the UDDS in units of grams/second of NOx. and CO2 were acceptable, but particulate matter (PM) deviations were substantial. Errors for prediction of NOx did not exceed 7 per cent for any case, and errors for CO2 prediction did not exceed 15 per cent. PM errors in the g/s case varied substantially, depending on the weighting case, indicating instabilities in the predictions. Errors for g/1 and g/kW h predictions were higher. A series of corrections was applied to each of the predictive cases for each emissions unit studied. These corrections are shown to improve the predictive ability of the weightings, but the fundamental nature of the prediction was eroded. A weighting using the intensive properties of average speed, percentage idle and average kinetic energy was found to yield the best uncorrected prediction for every case, regardless of the emissions unit considered. The best predictive method was also shown to work acceptably when applied to unseen data from another 12 heavy-duty vehicles.","Oxides of nitrogen; Particulate matter; Test cycle; Truck emissions","Acceleration measurement; Dynamometers; Kinetic energy; Nitrogen oxides; Parameter estimation; Particulate emissions; Vehicles; Velocity measurement; Diesel emissions; Oxides of Nitrogen; Particulate matter; Test cycle; Truck emissions; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-8644292591

In such high strength linepipe, excellent low-temperature toughness in the base material, weld metal and heat affected zone (HAZ) as well as excellent weldability are required to arrest a running shear fracture and to a prevent brittle fracture, and to improve installation efficiency. Recently, high uniform elongation and a low yield strength/tensile strength (Y/T) ratio for the linepipe material have been also required to prevent the ductile fracture by plastic deformation to the pipeline in seismic or permafrost regions. To improve the HAZ toughness of linepipe steel, the refinement of microstructure near a weld fusion line is very effective in that it utilizes the strong retardation of austenite grain growth and/or intragranular ferrite (IGF) transformed from oxide particles inside austenite grains and the reduction of carbon content is also quite effective. To improve uniform elongation and lower the Y/T ratio, utilizing a dual phase microstructure is necessary by applying accelerated cooling after controlled rolling. New high strength UOE linepipe up to X80, called ""Tough-Ace"" possessing both excellent HAZ toughness and high uniform elongation, has been developed, and the X60 UOE pipe has been mass-produced for the Sakhalin Project.

Woody plants are a major component of savanna vegetation determining rangeland condition and biodiversity. In this study we use a spatially explicit, stochastic computer model to assess the impact of climate change on the population dynamics of Grewia flava, a common, fleshy-fruited shrub species in the southern Kalahari. Understanding the population dynamics of Grewia flava is a crucial task, because it is widely involved in the shrub/bush encroachment process, a major concern for rangeland management due to its adverse effect on livestock carrying capacity and biodiversity. Results: For our study we consider four climate change scenarios that have been proposed for the southern Kalahari for the coming decades: (1) an increase in annual precipitation by 30-40%, (2) a decrease by 5-15%, (3) an increase in variation of extreme rainfall years by 10-20%, (4) and increase in temporal auto-correlation, i.e. increasing length and variation of periodic rainfall oscillations related to El Niño/La Niña phenomena. We evaluate the slope z of the time-shrub density relationship to quantify the population trend. For each climate change scenario we then compared the departure of z from typical stable population dynamics under current climatic conditions. Based on the simulation experiments we observed a positive population trend for scenario (1) and a negative trend for scenario (2). In terms of the projected rates of precipitation change for scenario (3) and (4) population dynamics were found to be relatively stable. However, for a larger increase in inter-annual variation or in temporal auto-correlation of rainfall population trends were negative, because favorable rainfall years had a limited positive impact due to the limited shrub carrying capacity. Conclusions: We conclude that a possible increase in precipitation will strongly facilitate shrub encroachment threatening savanna rangeland conditions and regional biodiversity. Furthermore, the negative effects found for positive auto-correlated rainfall support current ecological theory stating that periodically fluctuating environments can reduce population viability because species suffer disproportionately from poor environmental conditions. © 2004 Tews and Jeltsch; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"Grewia; rain; biodiversity; biological model; desert climate; ecosystem; environmental protection; plant; population dynamics; South Africa; Biodiversity; Conservation of Natural Resources; Desert Climate; Ecosystem; Models, Biological; Plants; Population Dynamics; Rain; South Africa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12344255995

Our sample consists of the Horsehead nebula (B33), the ρ Oph L1688 cloud interface, and the cometary-shaped cloud IC 63. Using the IRAM 30-m telescope, the SEST and the Effelsberg 100-m telescope, we mapped the emission of C2H, c-C 3H2 and C4H, and searched for heavy hydrocarbons such as c-C3H, l-C3H, l-C3H 2, l-C4H2 and C6H. The large scale maps show that small hydrocarbons are present until the edge of all PDRs, which is surprising as they are expected to be easily destroyed by UV radiation. Their spatial distribution reasonably agrees with the aromatic emission mapped in mid-IR wavelength bands. C2H and c-C3H2 correlate remarkably well, a trend already reported in the diffuse ISM (Lucas &amp; Liszt 2000). Their abundances relative to H2 are relatively high and comparable to the ones derived in dark clouds such as L134N or TMC-1, known as efficient carbon factories. The heavier species are however only detected in the Horsehead nebula at a position coincident with the aromatic emission peak around 7μm. In particular, we report the first detection of C6H in a PDR. We have run steady-state PDR models using several gas-phase chemical networks (UMIST95 and the New Standard Model) and conclude that both networks fail in reproducing the high abundances of some of these hydrocarbons by an order of magnitude. The high abundance of hydrocarbons in the PDR may suggest that the photo-erosion of UV-irradiated large carbonaceous compounds could efficiently feed the ISM with small carbon clusters or molecules. This new production mechanism of carbon chains and rings could overcome their destruction by the UV radiation field. Dedicated theoretical and laboratory measurements are required to understand and implement these additional chemical routes.","Astrochemistry; ISM: abundances; ISM: individual objects: Horsehead nebula, IC 63, ρ Oph","Carbon; Clouds; Data reduction; Oxygen; Photons; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Telescopes; Ultraviolet radiation; Astrochemistry; IC 63; ISM: abundances; ISM: individual objects: Horsehead nebula; Astrophysics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842582879

The primary carbon sources that support food webs clearly depended on location. The contribution of mangroves to food webs was confined only to mangroves, but a mixture of macroalgae and plankton was a major carbon source for organisms in the inner bay area. Offshore organisms clearly derived their carbon through the planktonic food web. The δ15N values of consumers were enriched by 3-4‰ relative to their diets. The δ15N data suggests that some of aquatic animals had capacity to change their feeding habits according to places and availability of foods and as a result, individuals of the same species could be assigned to different trophic levels at different places.","Fishes; Food web; Invertebrates; Mangroves; Primary producers; Stable carbon isotope; Stable nitrogen isotope","carbon isotope; estuarine ecosystem; food web; isotopic analysis; mangrove; primary production; trophic structure; Asia; Central Region [Thailand]; Eurasia; Khung Krabaen Bay; Southeast Asia; Thailand; Animalia; Halophila; Invertebrata; Pisces; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1842686810

Using projections of species' distributions for future climate scenarios, we assess extinction risks for sample regions that cover some 20% of the Earth's terrestrial surface. Exploring three approaches in which the estimated probability of extinction shows a power-law relationship with geographical range size, we predict, on the basis of mid-range climate-warming scenarios for 2050, that 15-37% of species in our sample of regions and taxa will be 'committed to extinction'. When the average of the three methods and two dispersal scenarios is taken, minimal climate-warming scenarios produce lower projections of species committed to extinction (∼18%) than mid-range (∼24%) and maximum-change (∼35%) scenarios.

The compounds possess additional electron-withdrawing groups such as CF3 and CN either on oxadiazole or on carbazole nucleus. The placement of CF 3 on the oxadiazole end enhances the electron deficiency of the oxadiazole unit, while the CN substituent at the carbazole nucleus decreases the donor strength of carbazole. This results in slight alterations in the oxidation potentials and thermal properties of the resulting dyads. This also leads to a pathway for fine-tuning the energy levels and amorphous morphology in these dyads. While CN groups alter by ∼0.2 eV the energy levels, a counterproductive Tg reduction/thermal instability is observed for the CF3 derivatives. All of these derivatives display solvent-dependent emission profiles with the solid-state emission occurring in the cyan region. Electroluminescent devices fabricated using these compounds as hole-transporting layer and Alq3 or TPBI as the electron-transporting layer emit cyan color.

There has been little research, however, on the effects of environmental regulations on the location decisions of firms and industries. This article attempts to bridge this gap by examining the impact of air pollution regulations implemented by the South Coast Air Quality Management District in 1988 on the wood household furniture industry in southern California. The regulations created a great deal of uncertainty within the industry. Some firms relocated to Mexico to avoid compliance. Other firms remained in the region and attempted to adjust through product and process innovations. Over time, and with the help of institutions, the industry adjusted through a process of ""learning by doing."" A challenge for community economic development practitioners is to build institutions that foster the learning process by which firms adjust to environmental regulations. © 2004 Sage Publications.","Environment; Furniture; Location; Regulations","air quality; industrial emission; industrial location; pollution control; California; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3543085681

The project was implemented by integrating a core of international experts in remote sensing, biogeochemical modeling, community socio-economic assessments, and carbon measurements in a fully collaborative manner with Senegal organizations, national scientists, and local knowledge and expertise. The study addresses the potential role developing countries in semi-arid areas can play in climate mitigation activities. Multiple benefits to smallholders could accrue as a result of management practices to re-establish soil carbon content lost because of land use changes or management practices that are not sustainable. The specific importance for the Sahel is because of the high vulnerability to climate change in already impoverished rural societies. The project focuses on four objectives in specific locations across the agroecological zones of Senegal. These objectives are: use of soil sampling and biogeochemical modeling to quantify the biophysical potential for carbon sequestration and to determine the sensitivity of the carbon stocks to various management and climate scenarios, to evaluate the socio-economic and cultural requirements necessary for successful project implementation directed toward an aggregation of smallholders to sequester around 100,000t carbon (C), to support capacity building to develop a Carbon Specialist Team, and to initiate extrapolation from site-specific project areas to the Sahel region and the national level. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The method has been developed and optimised by relating patterns of atmospheric fields (predictors) to station records of rainfall (predictands), for both rain occurrences and daily rain amounts. When tested on observational data, the analogue method is able to reproduce the trend observed globally during the past 50 yr, showing the sensitivity of the statistical approach to changed climatic conditions. The choice of predictor has an important impact on the results: mean sea level pressure (MSLP) and vertically integrated precipitable water (PWTR) are both important in explaining the observed local rainfall trend. The model is then applied to 3 coupled models' simulations of the current climate. The improvement gained when using the statistical downscaling tool over direct model grid-average outputs is substantial. Most of the model biases are removed and realistic probability distribution functions at the station level are obtained. The method is then applied to altered climate conditions; the impact of model sensitivities on large-scale responses is quantified using the various coupled models. Future trends for rainfall, estimated by direct climate model outputs, are compared with downscaled projections. A general agreement is found; uncertainties are smaller amongst projections when the downscaling technique is used. All projections agree on a mean reduction of total rainfall in winter and spring. The possible impact of future drying trends induced by global warming is compounded by changes in mean and extreme rainfall, such as long wet spells and large yearly totals. © Inter-Research 2004.","Australia; Climate change; Rainfall; Statistical downscaling","climate change; downscaling; global warming; rainfall; trend analysis; Australasia; Australia; Western Australia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344601609

These oceanic circulation changes generate an eastern North Pacific warming, an associated cooling in the Kuroshio area, as well as a cooling of the tropical oceans, respectively. The tropical cooling pattern resembles a permanent La Niña state which in turn forces atmospheric teleconnection patterns that lead to an enhancement of the subtropical warming by reduced latent and sensible cooling of the ocean. In addition, the radiative cooling due to atmospheric CO2 and water vapor reductions imposes a cooling tendency in the tropics and subtropics, thereby intensifying the permanent La Niña conditions. The remote North Pacific response results in a warming tendency of the eastern North Pacific which may level off the effect of the local radiative cooling. Hence, a delicate balance between oceanic circulation changes, remotely induced atmospheric flux anomalies as well local radiative cooling is established which controls the tropical and North Pacific temperature anomalies during the last glacial maximum. Furthermore, we discuss how the aftermath of a Heinrich event may have affected glacial temperatures in the Pacific Ocean. © Springer-Verlag 2004.",,"cooling; heat transfer; Last Glacial Maximum; oceanic circulation; paleoceanography; surface temperature; teleconnection; Pacific Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-5044223529

Despite variation in temperature and precipitation over the study period (1963-1999), O3 exposure consistently reduced simulated tree growth. Simulated growth reductions increased concurrent with increasing O3 exposure. The maximum growth reduction occurred in 1979. As O3 exposures decreased during the 1980s and 1990s, effects on growth also decreased. This implies that emission control strategies taken to reduce exposures to attain O3 standards benefited P. ponderosa growth in the San Bernardino Mountains.

A country violates this rule if an activity under its control does damage to another country, and if this is done on purpose or due to carelessness. Impacts of climate change fall under this rule, which is reinforced by many declarations and treaties, including the UNFCCC. Compensation for the harm done depends on many parameters, such as emission scenarios, climate change, climate change impacts and its accounting. The compensation paid by the OECD may run up to 4% of its GDP, far exceeding the costs of climate change to the OECD directly. However, the most crucial issues are, first, from when countries can be held responsible and, second, which emissions are acceptable and which careless.

We assess the impact of climate variation on the Ross River virus (RRv) transmission in the Townsville region, Queensland, north-east Australia. METHODS: We obtained population-based information on monthly variations in RRv cases, climatic factors, sea level, and population growth between 1985 and 1996. Cross-correlations were computed for a series of associations between climate variables (rainfall, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, relative humidity and high tide) and the monthly incidence of RRv disease over a range of time lags. We assessed the impact of climate variability on RRv transmission using the seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model. RESULTS: There were significant correlations of the monthly incidence of RRv to rainfall, maximum temperature, minimum temperature and relative humidity, all at a lag of 2 months, and high tide in the current month. The results of SARIMA models show that monthly average rainfall (β = 0.0007, P = 0.01) and high tide (β = 0.0089, P = 0.04) were significantly associated with RRv transmission and maximum temperature was also marginally significantly associated with monthly incidence of RRv (β = 0.0412, P = 0.07), although relative humidity did not seem to have played an important role in the Townsville region. CONCLUSIONS: Rainfall, high tide and maximum temperature were likely to be key determinants of RRv transmission in the Townsville region.","Climate change; Cross-correlation function; Ross River virus; Seasonal auto-regressive integrated moving average; Time series","rain; viral disease; article; Australia; calculation; climate change; correlation analysis; environmental temperature; human; humidity; incidence; model; population growth; population research; Ross River alpha virus; sea level; seasonal variation; tide; time series analysis; virus infection; virus transmission; Alphavirus Infections; Climate; Humans; Humidity; Incidence; Models, Biological; Queensland; Rain; Ross River virus; Seasons; Temperature; Time Factors; Alphavirus; RNA viruses; Ross River virus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1342343957

A fully polymerized C60 chain and a C60 dimer are found to be more stable than nonpolymerized C60, respectively, by 0.89 and 0.38 eV/C60. The geometry and energetics of an encapsulated C60 chain is not significantly different with respect to the isolated molecule. Encapsulation energies in BN and carbon NPP's are, respectively, 1.56 and 1.67 eV/C60, which are significantly larger than the calculated activation energy for C60 polymerization, supporting the hypothesis that encapsulated C60's in NPP's are partially polymerized. Band structure analysis show that polymerization does not affect the gap width of the C60 chain. BN NPP's are semiconductors with a gap width determined by the C60. The lowest unoccupied C 60 states lie just above the Fermi level in metallic carbon NPP's and charge transfert could take place, affecting the C60 geometry.",,"carbon nanotube; article; atom; chemical structure; density functional theory; electron; encapsulation; energy; energy transfer; geometry; nanoparticle; nanopeapod; polymerization; semiconductor",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-42749108174

Based on historical accounts, ethnographies, aerial photos, satellite images, field and household surveys as well as various participatory research activities with farmers in selected villages, the study attempts to make explicit layered scales of analysis, both temporally and spatially. It shows that, despite some general trends of resource degradation in the Old Peanut Basin, local farming systems have embarked on different pathways of change to adapt to their evolving environment. It also illustrates that high diversity with respect to soil fertility management exists at the farm and household level. Finally, the paper proposes a farmer-oriented approach to carbon sequestration in order to integrate recommended technical options more efficiently into the complex and dynamic livelihoods of smallholders in dryland environments. This approach includes pathway-specific land use and management options at the level of farming systems and, at the level of individual households, a basket of possible practices from which farmers can choose depending on their multiple needs, capacities, and adaptive strategies to cope with risk and uncertainty. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

A study was conducted in Senegal's Old Peanut Basin to assess current carbon stocks and to examine management options for their increase. Average soil and woody biomass carbon contents were 11.3 and 6.3t carbon (C)ha-1, respectively. CENTURY, a biogeochemical model, was used to simulate soil and biomass carbon over a period of 25 and 50 years under a series of land use and management options. These simulated practices resulted in C dynamics ranging from -0.13t Cha-1yr-1 from a worst-case millet-sorghum rotation to +0.43tCha-1yr-1 on intensively managed agricultural fields. Agroforestry simulations involving Faidherbia albida (Del.) Chev. and Leucaena leucocephala (Lam.) deWit. also resulted in promising carbon gain (+0.22 and +0.12tCha-1yr-1, respectively), suggesting that improving agricultural practices is key to enhancing food production and mitigating climate change. Results from a sensitivity analysis suggest that woody biomass carbon is more sensitive to long-term changes in precipitation and temperature than soil carbon. Other management strategies likely to result in lower rates of soil carbon sequestration, including short-term improved fallows, should also be considered viable opportunities because promoting too narrow a set of 'best management practices' risks weakening local adaptability and opportunistic management regimes, both of which are crucial elements in small-scale farming systems in drylands. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

While considerable effort has been made to assess the benefits for local soils, regional ecosystems, as well as the global climate, few estimates exist regarding detailed costs and benefits for local smallholders, the ultimate actors and beneficiaries of carbon offset projects. This paper presents a farmer-centered ex-ante cost-benefit analysis of 15 management and land use options combined with a household budget model to assess what practices are most profitable and economically feasible for local farmers in the Old Peanut Basin of Senegal. The results show significant differences in anticipated net benefits for various management options, ranging from -$1400 to $9600 tC-1. Given the differential resource-endowment of local smallholders, carefully designed cost-sharing mechanisms would be necessary to achieve equitable and efficient local participation in carbon sequestration schemes. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

Photocatalysts were applied to the CO2 photocatalytic reduction and the yield of the major product, methanol, was used to evaluate the photocatalytic performance. Copper precursors and the adding time with sol as well as posttreatments were studied to explore the relationships between the characteristics and the activity of the photocatalysts. The results revealed that Cu/TiO2 prepared from copper chloride and added in the early sol-gel stage was more photoactive than that from copper acetate. Additional H2 reduction of calcined catalysts before the photoreduction CO2 decreased the yield of methanol due to the change of copper dispersion and oxidation state. TPR, XPS, and XAS measurements verified the oxidation state of Cu on Cu/TiO2 catalysts. The results indicated that the primary Cu(I) served as an active site. The zeta potentials of catalysts were measured and compared, showing that a higher positive zeta potential at pH 7 would lead to higher activity. Under 30-h UVC (254 nm) irradiation, the best catalyst gave a methanol yield above 600 μmol/gcat. Switching to UVA (365 nm) resulted in a significant decrease of methanol yield in the range of 10 μmol/g cat. © 2003 Elsevier Inc.

In a section exposed near Gotzikas (NW Epirus), we sampled a number of decimetre-thick, organic carbon-rich units enclosed within marly, locally silicified, Vigla Limestone (Berriasian-Turonian). All these units are characterized by largely comparable bulk geochemical characteristics, indicating a common marine origin and low thermal maturity. However, the stratigraphically highest of these black shales is further distinguished by its much higher total organic-carbon (TOC) content (28.9 wt%) and Hydrogen Index (HI) (529), and much enriched δ13Corg value (-22.1‰). Planktonic foraminiferal and calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy indicate a lower to middle Albian age for the strata immediately above, and a lower Aptian age for the strata below, the uppermost black shale. In terms of molecular organic geochemistry, the latter black shale is also relatively enriched in specific isoprenoidal compounds (especially monocyclic isoprenoids), whose isotopic values are as high as - 15‰, indicating a substantial archaeal contribution to the organic matter.

[11C]FMZ PET was performed in ten normal subjects. A DV image and ten sequential 5-min SUV images were generated for each subject. We investigated the correlation coefficient (r) and standard estimation of error (SEE) between the latter ten static images and the DV image using the pixel-by-pixel method, thereby determining the optimum acquisition phase. The same FMZ PET procedure was performed in 15 patients with unilateral CVD. Twenty regions of interest (ROIs) were positioned both in lesioned areas and in symmetrical regions. DV and SUV in the optimum phase for each ROI were calculated to compare the lesion-to-normal (L/N) ratio of DV and that of SUV. The highest r and a low SEE (r=0.957, SEE=633) were observed from 30 to 35 min after tracer administration in the study of normal subjects. A high r (0.945) and a low SEE (0.0438) between the DV L/N ratio and the SUV L/N ratio were obtained in the study of patients. Our study suggests that SUV images acquired from 30 to 35 min after FMZ administration are a suitable alternative to DV images not only in normal subjects but also in patients with unilateral CVD.

The approach to interpretation of the correlation results took into account the concept of hard and soft acids and bases. The results of the σρ correlation analysis of ΔG gas, pK a, and logk D of terminal acetylenes, allowing a common description of the effect of structural factors on these quantities with induction σ I constants, suggest uniformity of the electronic interactions. As a consequence, there are no thermodynamic deviations from the Brønsted relationship. The correlations of ΔG gas and pK a of substituted benzenes, and also of methane derivatives forming nonplanar carbanions, suggest the prevalence of the induction effect on these quantities; however, the resonance effect makes an increased contribution to logk D. This difference in the behavior of the characteristics of the CH acidity is consistent with the conclusion made in the previous paper that the interactions in these compound series are characterized by solvation nonuniformity. For methane derivatives forming planar carbanions, the main mechanism of stabilization of these species in the gas phase, DMSO solution, and transition state of the reaction is the resonance effect. The experimentally observed deviation from the linearity of the Brønsted relationship is in this case also attributable to the nonuniformity of the interactions. The solvation interaction responsible for variation of pK a in DMSO depends on the contributions of the electrostatic factor and H bonding, whereas the solvation interaction responsible for variation of logk D involves only a certain fraction of the covalent bonding with a hydroxyl-containing solvent in the transition state of the reaction.",,"acetylene; benzene; methane; acidity; article; chemical analysis; chemical procedures; chemical reaction; chemical structure; correlation analysis; covalent bond; electricity; electron; gas; kinetics; liquid; prevalence; solvation; thermodynamics",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-7244239408

Remote sensing capabilities, developed over the past several decades, now provide regular, high-resolution (10-meter to 1-kilometer) mapping and monitoring of land surface characteristics relevant to modeling, including vegetation type, biomass, stand age class, phenology, leaf area index, and tree height. Integration of these data sets with ecosystem process models and distributed climate data provides a means for regional assessment of carbon fluxes and analysis of the underlying processes affecting them.

Exhaust gases were produced by a turbocharged EURO 2 heavy-duty diesel engine, operating in steady-state conditions on the European test 13 mode cycle (ECE R49). Regulated and unregulated pollutants, such as carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and nitrated derivatives (nitro-PAHs), carbonyl compounds and light aromatic hydrocarbons were quantified. Mutagenicity of the emissions was evaluated by the Salmonella typhimurium/mammalian microsome assay. The effect of the fuels under study on the size distribution of particulate matter (PM) was also evaluated. The use of biodiesel blend seems to result in small reductions of emissions of most of the aromatic and polyaromatic compounds; these differences, however, have no statistical significance at 95% confidence level. Formaldehyde, on the other hand, has a statistically significant increase of 18% with biodiesel blend. In vitro toxicological assays show an overall similar mutagenic potency and genotoxic profile for diesel and biodiesel blend emissions. The electron microscopy analysis indicates that PM for both fuels has the same chemical composition, morphology, shape and granulometric spectrum, with most of the particles in the range 0.06-0.3 μm. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Several common events were identified along the two ice cores on the basis of acidity and sulphate spikes in snow layers. Timescales were matched through comparison with isotope (δD) profiles and using the Antarctic cold reversal (ACR) minimum, a 10Be peak, and a dust spike as temporal checkpoints. Ratios of relative snow accumulation at the two sites during the Holocene, in the glacial-interglacial transition and in the last part of the glacial period, were reconstructed by finding the best fit between Dome C and Vostok depths recording the same events. After accounting for thinning of the layers as they are buried within the glacier, the Dome C-Vostok accumulation ratio, expected to be roughly constant from the conventional accumulation-temperature-isotope approach, is 1.12 for the glacial period but increases to as much as 1.44 for a large part of the Holocene. Glaciological effects, mainly related to the geographic origin of the Vostok ice along the Ridge B-Vostok axis, can account for only a minor fraction of this change. Instead, we argue that accumulation variability between the cores stems from differential changes in atmospheric circulation during these respective climatic periods at the two sites. Regional changes in atmospheric circulation are proposed with a negative anomaly in Dome C, a positive accumulation anomaly in Vostok, or a combination of both during glacial climate. Our approach may help to improve ice core dating by: (1) revealing anomalies in accumulation-rate estimation based on the classical thermodynamic method and (2) supporting the necessity to take into account contributions due to changes in atmospheric circulation processes.

The approach takes into account both the topological features of the essentially anisotropic band structure of such compounds (using the strong-bond approximation) and the bending of energy bands induced by field penetration under the conditions of field emission experiments. This field penetration results from the low concentration of mobile charge carriers. Numerical calculations have been performed, and approximate analytical expressions derived, for field emission spectra from the (100) and (010) faces. The theoretical results obtained are able to account for the main 'abnormal' experimental characteristics of field emission from the (100) plane of YBa 2Cu3O7-y.

A structural study reveals a WIr2-centred plane of bridging carbonyls, in contrast to the crystal structure of WIr3(CO)11 (η-C5H5) (all-terminal carbonyl distribution). DFT calculations reveal an increasing proclivity to adopt an all-terminal CO disposition for clusters MIr3(CO)11 (η-C5H5) in the gas phase on proceeding from M=Cr to Mo and then W, consistent with structural studies in the solid state for which the tungsten-containing cluster is the only all-terminal example. Increasing electron donation from the ligands in the tungsten system (either from phosphine substitution or cyclopentadienyl permethylation) suffices to impose a plane of bridging carbonyls in the ground state structure. 13C NMR fluxionality studies reveal that CO exchange mechanism(s) for WIr3(CO)11 (η-C5H5) and the related tetrahedral cluster W2Ir2(CO)10(η-C5 H5)2 are very fast and involve all carbonyls on the clusters. DFT calculations on MIr3(CO)11 (η-C5H5) (M=Cr, Mo) substantiate a ' merry-go-round' mechanism for carbonyl scrambling in these systems, a result which is consistent with the scrambling behaviour seen in the NMR fluxionality studies on the W-containing congener. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Those rocks lacking sufficient porosity-permeability, such as sandstones, siltstones and organic matter poor shales, may not have been affected by fluid movement.

The manifestation of the first ionization potential (FIP) effect was observed here as in previous streamers. Two aspects of this streamer make it unusual and worth special attention. The active region streamer observed possessed an abundance-depleted core typically, although not exclusively, seen in quiescent streamers. A coronal mass ejection (CME) occurred at the active region during the observations. This event resulted in the second unexpected aspect of this streamer, its quick return to the same general abundance characteristics that existed before the CME occurred. The re-formation of a depleted core and the presence of the FIP effect immediately after a highly disruptive event are surprising given the 1 day timescale predicted by streamer theories.","Sun: abundances; Sun: activity; Sun: corona; Sun: coronal mass ejections (CMEs); Sun: UV radiation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2142641653

It originated in the United States but has recently attracted international attention. The attractiveness of disclosure is obvious; it promises environmental improvement combined with strengthened environmental democracy and community empowerment. By analysing the experiences in the US, and the developments in the Netherlands, this paper seeks to assess the functioning and effectiveness of disclosure. The available empirical evidence suggests that disclosure has a positive impact on the environmental performance of industrial facilities as well as a democratising effect. It is argued tha Dutch policy makers wrongfully assume that disclosure cannot work in the Netherlands. The consequence is that citizens are provided with little specific information that cannot be used to put pressure on polluters. © 2004 Taylor and Francis Ltd.",,"emission control; empowerment; environmental policy; international comparison; policy making; pollution control; Benelux; Eurasia; Europe; Netherlands; North America; United States; Western Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143104572

Total carbon ingestion rates based on size-fractioned chlorophyll data showed that dominant copepods (Acartia tonsa, Centropages brachiatus, Oithona similis and Paracalanus parvus) ingested between 2 and 8 μg C ind. -1 d-1, while appendicularians (Oikopleura dioica and O. longicauda) ingested ∼3 to 4 μg C ind.-1 d-1.

In contrast, chain-forming diatoms were cleared at very low rates by copepods. Bacteria were cleared only by appendicularians (∼170 to ∼400 ml ind.-1 d-1) but not by any copepod, while heterotrophic protists constituted a substantial proportion in the diet of both copepods and appendicularians (∼10 to 100 % body carbon d-1), particularly during austral spring. Occasionally, copepod C-specific ingestion on heterotrophs was similar to that on autotrophic cells. Large ciliates and dinoflagellates were cleared but not ingested by the appendicularian O. dioica, suggesting a mechanism of trapping large cells in their houses and implying a rapid export of fresh material. Since heterotrophs are a common component in the diet of these 2 groups (omnivory by copepods and bacterophagy by appendicularians), they can potentially affect microbial food webs in this upwelling system and thus carbon export.","Appendicularians; Carbon flux; Clearance rate; Copepods; Microzooplankton; Omnivory","Acartia; Acartia tonsa; Acartia tonsa; Appendicularia (class); Bacillariophyta; Bacteria (microorganisms); Centropages; Centropages brachiatus; Ciliophora; Copepoda; Dinophyceae; Oikopleura; Oikopleura dioica; Oikopleura dioica; Oikopleura longicauda; Oikopleura longicauda; Oithona; Oithona similis; Oithona similis; Paracalanus; Paracalanus parvus; Paracalanus parvus; Protista",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143153942

Mejillones Bay was influenced by moderate upwelling events during February and October and presented a shallow (30 to 40 m depth) oxygen minimum layer (OML). On all sampling occasions, chain-forming diatoms that were grazed by small zooplankton and heterotrophic (h-)dinoflagellates comprised most of the autotrophic biomass. Heterotrophic (h-)nanoflagellates were largely bacterivorous, and responsible for a substantial removal of bacterial biomass, mostly associated with productive surface waters and the OML. Ciliate biomass was relatively low during all periods, but ciliates removed a large fraction of h-nanoflagellate production (12 to 22 % d-1). Thus, in the microbial food web bacterial carbon can be transferred to ciliates and then subsequently to zooplankton. The impact of small zooplankton on primary production (PP) was relatively low on all sampling occasions. Small copepods and appendicularians removed from 0.6 to 5%, and from 0.08 to 0.6% PP d-1 respectively. Appendicularians were the only zooplankton able to graze on bacteria, but grazing impact was not sufficient to regulate bacterial biomass. The microheterotrophic pathway could be an important link in this highly productive upwelling embayment. Our results showed that a large part of the photosynthetically fixed carbon was channeled through the microbial food web, with only a small part allocated to copepods and appendicularians. The food-web structure of Mejillones Bay can be classified as multivorous, with herbivorous and microbial grazing playing an important role in carbon export.","Appendicularians; Carbon flow; Copepods; Humboldt Current System; Microbial food web; Protozoans; Upwelling system","Appendicularia (class); Bacillariophyta; Bacteria (microorganisms); Ciliophora; Copepoda; Dinophyceae; Protozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143096991

Although climate models, such as Global Circulation Models (GCMs) continue to evolve, their outputs remain crude and often even inappropriate to watershed-scale hydrological analyses. The bridging techniques are evolving, though. Many families of regionalization technologies are under progress in parallel. Perhaps the most important advances are in the field of regional weather patterns, such as ENSO (El Niño-Southern Oscillation), NAO (North Atlantic Oscillation) and many more. The gap from hydrology to water resources development is by far not that wide. The traditional and contemporary practices are well in place. In climate change studies, the bottleneck is not in this link itself but in the climatic input. The tendency seems to be towards integrated water resources assessments, where climate is only one among many changes that are expected to occur, such as demography, land cover and land use, economy, technologies, and so forth. In such a pragmatic setting a risk-analytic interpretation of those scenarios is often called for. The above-outlined continuum from climate to water is a topic where the physically based modelers, the empiricists and the pragmatists should not get restricted to their own way of thinking. The issues should develop hand in hand. Perhaps the greatest challenge is to incorporate and respect the pragmatic policy-related component to the two other branches. For this purpose, it is helpful to reverse the direction of thinking from time to time to start - instead of climate models - from practical needs and think how the climate scenarios and models help really in the difficult task of designing better water structures, outline better policies and formulate better operational rules in the water field.",,"Climate models; Global circulation models (GCM); Regionalization; Water resources management; Climate change; Hydrology; Land use; Mathematical models; Risk assessment; Water resources; Weather forecasting; Climatology; climate change; climate modeling; regional climate; resource management; water resource",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-6044273005

Medical Center, Minneapolis, MN, United States","The effects of peroxynitrite (PN; product of the reaction between nitric oxide and superoxide) on mitochondrial respiration as well as oxidation of α-tocopherol and ascorbic acid were studied. Mitochondria were isolated from brain hemispheres of 4-month-old male Fisher rats by standard centrifugation procedures utilizing Ficoll gradients. Treatment of brain mitochondria with PN caused a concentration-dependent impairment of oxidative phosphorylation and depletion of the endogenous antioxidants α-tocopherol and ascorbic acid. PN-induced mitochondrial dysfunction was characterized by 1) decreases in state 3 respiration and oxidative phosphorylation, 2) loss of respiratory control [ratio of ADP-stimulated (state 3) to basal (state 4) respiration], and 3) uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation. PN did not function as a pure uncoupler, insofar as the increase in state 4 respiration was accompanied by a larger decrease in state 3 respiration. This contrasts with the uncoupling action of the protonophore carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrozone, which increases both state 3 and state 4 respiration. PN-induced reduction in respiratory control and oxidative phosphorylation closely paralleled the oxidation of membrane tocopherol and were preceded by loss of ascorbate. α-Tocopherol (the most potent biological lipid antioxidant) may have a unique role in protecting mitochondrial membranes from oxidative stress. The two antioxidant nutrients α-tocopherol and ascorbate (which interact with each other and glutathione) may be intimately involved in protecting mitochondria in situations in which excessive release of superoxide and nitric oxide occurs under normal and/or pathological conditions. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Mitochondria; Oxidative phosphorylation; Peroxynitrite; Vitamin C; Vitamin E","adenosine diphosphate; alpha tocopherol; antioxidant; ascorbic acid; carbonyl cyanide chlorophenylhydrazone; glutathione; nitric oxide; peroxynitrite; superoxide; adolescent; animal tissue; article; brain mitochondrion; concentration response; controlled study; male; mitochondrial membrane; mitochondrial respiration; nonhuman; oxidation; oxidative phosphorylation; oxidative stress; priority journal; rat; vitamin metabolism; Animals; Ascorbic Acid; Brain; Carbonyl Cyanide m-Chlorophenyl Hydrazone; Cell Respiration; Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Ionophores; Male; Mitochondria; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Phosphorylation; Peroxynitrous Acid; Phosphorylation; Rats; Rats, Inbred F344; Vitamin E",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542274276

The increased availability of field observations of DMS and related compounds (DMS(P)) and of their transformation rates in the ocean has stimulated the development of ecosystem models of marine sulfur cycling. The models cover a wide range of complexity levels and spatial/temporal scales, from zero-dimensional local simulations spanning a few days to regional/global simulations driven by ocean general circulation models. The degree of complexity required to model DMS(P) dynamics, particularly the differentiation into phytoplankton species or groups, remains an important open question. First attempts to drive these models with vertically resolved turbulence models suggest interesting interactions between DMS(P) dynamics and fine-scale ocean mixing that can modify fluxes of DMS to the atmosphere. Recent models also bring into focus the strong affinities between the cycling of DMS(P) and that of dissolved organic carbon in the surface ocean. Formal parameter estimation techniques, which are increasingly used in ecosystem modelling of carbon and nitrogen dynamics, should play a stronger role in the development of DMS sulfur modelling. Extrapolation of DMS cycling and fluxes to the global scale presently relies largely on empirical approach. A semiempirical approach, based on a simple ecosystem model, is shown to reproduce gross features of the global distribution of DMS in the surface ocean. This shows promise for the continuing development of ecosystem models for global modelling of marine sulfur fluxes to the atmosphere.",,"dimethylsulfide; ecosystem modeling; general circulation model; global climate; sulfur cycle",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4544249919

In this case, the carbon impurity has been chosen since it can be an important contaminant in fusion reactors. Hot-Pressing at 1500 °C in a carbon rich atmosphere has been found to be a powerful method to introduce carbon in two different alumina powders. Due to the presence of C in the samples, they acquire a black colour. To check the ability of C to penetrate into alumina, microstructure (SEM,TEM) and chemical analyses (ICP-AES and EA) have been performed. The existence of pyrolitic carbon at the alumina grain boundaries in the as-sintered state has been observed. The dielectric properties (permittivity and loss tangent) as a function of frequency (from 0.1 Hz to 20 GHz) and DC conductivity of the sintered material were measured by means of several techniques. The most dramatic effect is that the DC conductivity is strongly enhanced when carbon reaches concentrations higher than about 0.5% wt. Oxidation of these samples by a treatment at 1500 °C in air reduces the C content and restores a white exterior colour. In general this treatment strongly reduces the dielectric loss.

The short-term impact of UVR (i.e. measured as radiocarbon incorporation) was assessed by exposing samples to solar radiation under six radiation treatments: uncovered quartz tubes and tubes covered with different cut-off Schott filters (WG295, WG305, WG320, WG360), and Plexiglas UF-3 (cut-off at 400 nm), so that samples received radiation at five different intervals within the UVR in addition to photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and only PAR, respectively. Phytoplankton composition and abundance allowed us to differentiate pre-bloom, bloom and post-bloom periods, with pre- and post-bloom samples characterized by small cells (e.g. flagellates <10 μm), whereas the bloom was dominated by large diatoms (∼50 μm). Absolute values of photosynthesis inhibition were lower during the bloom, but biological weighting functions (i.e. inhibition per unit energy) indicated that this assemblage was more sensitive to UVR (especially in the UV-B region, 280-320 nm) than those ofthepre- and post-bloom periods. UV-A radiation (320-400 nm) accounted for most of the reduction in carbon incorporation (>60%), especially during the pre- and post-bloom periods. Most of the observed variability was interseasonal, although small intra-seasonal fluctuations were also observed. Our results indicate that the taxonomic composition and cellular size are especially important when addressing UVR effects upon these assemblages. However, other factors such as mixing can also contribute to the variability in responses to UVR.",,"annual variation; phytoplankton; primary production; ultraviolet radiation; Argentina; Patagonia; South America; algae; Bacillariophyta; Eukaryota; Mastigophora (flagellates); Rickettsia sp.

Methods: After an initial cautionary suspension of all soybean unloading operations, they were subsequently resumed under restrictive criteria for time, flux, simultaneity, and meteorological conditions. Emission filtration systems based on either micro pore size filters or polytetrafluoroethylene membranes on tetratex filters showed promising results. Results: Allergen emission underwent a very important decrease to levels 95% to 98% lower. Emissions from the two plants with unloading operations are in the same order of magnitude as the processing plant that does not unload soybean. Allergen concentration levels presented fluctuations initially, but the new filters decreased mean values; despite increased unloading, allergen levels did not increase - mean allergen levels on unloading days (67 U/m 3) and on days without unloading operations (63 U/m3) are similar. A panel of patients detected a cluster of increased symptoms during unloading operations on a day with suboptimal meteorological conditions and comparatively low allergen levels (225-415 U/m3). Since the June 1996 episode, no further asthma outbreak has been detected. Conclusions: The evaluation shows the effectiveness of the new filters in the control of soybean dust emission. With a systematic control programme, industrial soybean operations may function near urban centres without public health risks.

Inorganic pollutants are regularly controlled but organic pollutants have received little attention up to now. In this paper, we have developed an analytical procedure using microwave-assisted extraction prior to liquid chromatography coupled with diode array (LC-DAD) or fluorescence (LC-FL) detectors for the determination of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in sewage sludge. The main factors affecting the extraction efficiency (microwave power, irradiation time and extractant volume) were optimized. Clean-up of sewage sludge extracts was not found to be necessary. For adequate fluorescence detection of PAHs a temporal program of excitation and emission wavelengths was used. The optimized method was applied to the extraction of PAHs from various sludges from a waste water treatment plant (Jerez de la Frontera, Cadiz, Spain). The limits of detection were between 4 ng g-1 sewage sludge for benzo[b]fluoranthene and 12 ng g-1 sewage sludge for pyrene using LC-FL. When LC-DAD is used the limits of detection were between 13 ng g-1 for indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene and 62 ng g-1 for naphthalene. The relative standard deviations were found to be &lt;10%. The validation of the proposed method was carried out by application to analysis for PAHs in a certified reference material (CRM) 088 dried sewage sludge of the Community Bureau of Reference (BCR). The recoveries were between 69% for benzo[k]fluoranthene and 110% for pyrene using LC-FL and between 52% for indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene and 104% for benzo[a]pyrene using LC-DAD of the certified values.

In oral surgery, it is generally used for the treatment of oral and oropharyngeal small mucous tumors, due to the scarce morbidity that takes place and the absence of reconstructive necessity. Objective: To analyze the postoperative evolution, in the patients treated by oral and oropharyngeal epidermoid carcinomas, after CO2 laser resection. To compare it with that of the patients treated by means of conventional surgical methods, achieving the reconstruction through direct suture or the employment of local, regional or distance flaps. Methods: A prospective study was designed including 70 patients treated by oral and oropharyngeal epidermoid carcinomas. Thirty-five patients were treated by means of CO2 laser, in 10 cases direct wound-closure was realized, and in the remaining 25 patients some local, regional or distance flap were used. There were analysed the presence of postoperative pain, the degree of cicatricial retraction, and the speech and swallowing functional results. Results: We obtained a smaller painful degree and postoperative cicatricial retraction by the employment of CO2 laser. It permits minimizing the functional speech sequels (better words articulation) and swallowing (effective and precocious functional recovery). Conclusion: CO2 laser resection has become the elective treatment for small oral and oropharyngeal epidermoid carcinomas. The reasons are the absence of reconstructive surgery necessity, the scarce cicatricial retraction, and the excellent postoperative evolution.","CO2 laser; Oral and oropharyngeal epidermoid carcinomas","adult; aged; article; carbon dioxide laser; convalescence; elective surgery; energy; female; human; laser surgery; major clinical study; male; morbidity; mouth carcinoma; oral surgery; oropharynx carcinoma; oropharynx tumor; postoperative pain; postoperative period; prospective study; speech articulation; squamous cell carcinoma; suture; swallowing; treatment indication; treatment outcome; vaporization; wound closure",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042773004

One scaling approach is the disaggregation-aggregation approach, which involves disaggregating catchment-scale state variables to point-scale distributions, applying a suitable point-scale physical model using these state variables, and aggregating the resulting point-scale responses to yield a catchment-scale response. Thus, the approach provides a way of linking the catchment-scale state variables with the catchment-scale responses and thereby permits the development of empirical large-scale models that still retain some essence of the small-scale physics. In this paper we illustrate the disaggregation-aggregation approach with two examples that deal with developing catchment-scale conceptualizations of (a) infiltration excess runoff and (b) evapotranspiration, using detailed process-based models available at the small scale.

The concept of public's right to information gives the basis for the access to environmental information. In this paper the quality of air pollutant monitoring systems in the 15 European member states is analyzed. For pragmatic reasons only the capitals are looked upon. Comprehensive data on environmental monitoring programs concerning air pollutants like ozone (O 3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), nitrogen oxide (NO), carbon dioxide (CO2) and carbon monoxide (CO), and sometimes suspended dust, benzene and other environmental chemicals are available on the free Internet. As different monitoring information systems exist in the European member states a comparison of these systems with their pros and cons is of great interest to the public. Environmental air pollutant monitoring systems in the capitals of the 15 EEC member countries (objects) are evaluated by applying 5 evaluation criteria for the differentiation of these systems. The scores run from 0 = insufficient, 1 = medium, to 2 = excellent. Different data-analysis methods will be applied. As order theory is still not sufficiently presented in the scientific literature, a short overview about the so-called Hasse diagram technique and POSAC method is outlined. In several steps the data-matrix is analyzed coming to the conclusion that all methods (additionally PCA is used) identify one criterion as specifically important. Not unexpected, each method has its own advantage. The aim of this data-analysis is the evaluation of the publicly available air quality monitoring systems in Europe with their pros and cons. This might help the interested public to find and understand the information given on the Internet. Furthermore our evaluation approach might give some recommendations for an improvement of the air quality monitoring systems.

At high collision velocities and for not too heavy projectiles, where Z/v ≪ 1 with v being the collision velocity, mutual ionization proceeds via the two-centre dielectronic interaction (TCDI) which couples two electrons initially bound in the different colliding particles. Several aspects of electron emission from the target are explored in detail for the case when the final internal continuum state of the projectile is not detected, i.e. when the integration is performed in calculations over all possible final continuum states of the electron ejected from the projectile. Our results show that the relativistic effects in the TCDI clearly manifest themselves in the spectra of electrons emitted from the target.

To examine the importance of the enzyme to the functioning of the C4 photosynthetic pathway, Flaveria bidentis (L.) Kuntze, a C4 dicot, was genetically transformed with an antisense construct in which the cDNA encoding a putative cytosolic CA (CA3) was placed under the control of a constitutive promoter. Some of the primary transformants had impaired CO2 assimilation rates and required high CO2 for growth. The T1 progeny of four primary transformants were used to examine the quantitative relationship between leaf CA activity and CO2 assimilation rate. CA activity was determined in leaf extracts with a mass spectrometric technique that measured the rate of 18O exchange from doubly labelled 13C 18O2. Steady-state CO2 assimilation rates were unaffected by a decrease in CA activity until CA activity was less than 20% of wild type when they decreased steeply. Transformants with less than 10% of wild-type CA activity had very low CO2 assimilation rates and grew poorly at ambient CO2 partial pressure. Reduction in CA activity also increased the CO2 partial pressure required to saturate CO 2 assimilation rates. The present data show that CA activity is essential for the functioning of the C4 photosynthetic pathway.","Antisense RNA; C4 photosynthesis; Carbonic anhydrase; Flaveria bidentis","photosynthesis; Flaveria; Flaveria bidentis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642558157

To comply with the new regulations, the EU wants new techniques such as adapted feeding strategies and low emission building techniques to reduce ammonia emissions from livestock buildings. However, such ammonia restriction measures are only useful when their efficiency can be measured in the field. Current reliable measuring techniques are mainly based on continuous measurements over a long period (up to 200 days), and this requires expensive equipment. This makes them unsuitable for permanent evaluation on a large number of buildings. The main objective of the study presented here was the development of a procedure to determine NH3emissions from livestock buildings in the field, based on a limited number of measuring days. This method allows several buildings to be evaluated 'simultaneously' with the same measuring installation. In this study, high frequent ammonia measurements were taken from real livestock buildings for a year and were used to calculate NH3 emission factors for pig houses. A procedure was developed based on the knowledge that NH3 emission is strongly related to other variables that can be more easily measured over a yearly period, such as temperature, ventilation rate, number of animals and animal weight. Another assumption was that farm management could have significant influence on NH 3 emission, and consequently, this must be incorporated into the predictions. The prediction error between the measured and the calculated total NH3 emission was less than 3% when only 8 days were selected over a whole year, on condition that 4 days were selected within the same growth period and 4 other days are selected in at least two other growth periods. © 2004 Silsoe Research Institute.

We tested the impact of meso-beta details of topography on precipitation by simulating 15 cases of heavy precipitation during the Mesoscale Alpine Programme (MAP) special observing period with the MM5 model. Data show that the selected 15 cases are climatologically representative since the precipitation amount for these 15 days shows two climatological precipitation maxima and a drier region between them. We used different idealized topographies of the Alps, as well as the real topography and modifications of the latter at meso-beta scale. The simulations with different idealized topographies show clear influence of supra-regional (scale of some 100 km) convergence upon correct location of the southern Alpine maxima and that the concave terrain shapes at this scale determine the location of the precipitation maxima. The simulations with modified real topography show that (i) in the case of ""removal"" of the southwards bulging Trentino Mts. the precipitation maximum concentrates at this ""modified"" region; (ii) with removal of the Dinaric Alps the precipitation on the eastern part of the Alps is significantly reduced. © Gebrüder Borntraeger, Berlin, Stuttgart 2004.",,"Climatology; Computer simulation; Landforms; Precipitation (meteorology); Rain; alpine environment; precipitation (climatology); precipitation intensity; topography; Alps; Eurasia; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-31344445996

The regional-scale approach (southern, central and northern Finland) was used for trend assessment with respect to implementation of European sulphur (S) emission reduction amendments involving deposition changes prior to (1973-1985) and after (1986-2000) the agreements (S protocols in 1985 and 1994). There were no marked changes in sulphate deposition between the 1970s and 1980s and consistent trends in 1973-1985 were not observed. Deposition of nitrogen (N) compounds, particularly NO3-N, were increasing between the 1970s and 1980s. Deposition of base cations exhibited a slight decline throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Decrease of calcium and magnesium deposition without corresponding decrease in sulphate resulted in increased acidifying potential (AP) of deposition. Due to successful implementation of S (and N) emission reduction measures, sulphate deposition has decreased substantially (30% in northern and up to 60% in southern Finland) since the late 1980s. N deposition also decreased, but less than S deposition. Base cation deposition has also declined substantially, but this decline appeared to be leveling off during the 1990s, accounting for the decrease of AP in deposition. The observed deposition pattern is in agreement with the on-going biochemical recovery of acidified small Finnish lakes taking place since the early 1990s. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

One band (a) has a maximum around 400 nm, and the other (β) has a maximum around 500 nm. The ratio of the intensity of the a band to the intensity of the β band depends on the counterion (Na+, Li +, and Cs+) and the solvent. Varying the MANA content of the copolymer with Na+ counterions increases the relative intensity of the α emission in proportion to the density of MANA residues in the ionomer chain, whereas in chains containing only 0.1% MANA residues, only a β emission can be seen. The α emission is due to associated ion pairs, and the β emission is due to unassociated ion pairs. The shorter the alkyl chain pendant is of the copolymer, the larger the fraction is of the associated ion pairs. The half-bandwidth of the β emission is much larger than that of the α-emission band in all cases. The half-bandwidth decreases in the order Li+ &gt; Na+ &gt; Cs+. The fluorescence anisotropy decays for the α- and β-emission bands are double-exponential. The longer rotational correlation time and its fractional contribution to the β emission increase with an increasing content of the MANA monomer in the copolymer. The decay anisotropy data are consistent with the shell-core model of ionomers in nonpolar solvents. The fluorescence anisotropy decay of the copolymer of butyl methacrylate with a low content of the nonneutralized MANA (∼ 0.1 mol %) is single-exponential, and the rotational correlation time of the MANA fluorophore is eight times longer than that of 3-acetyl-2-naphthoic acid methyl ester (0.3 ns) in the same solvent. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.","Anisotropy decay; Association in solutions; Fluorescence; Ionomers; Poly(alkyl methacrylate)s; Rotational correlation time; Solution properties","Absorption spectroscopy; Agglomeration; Anisotropy; Carboxylic acids; Correlation methods; Fluorescence; Ionomers; Molecular weight; Polystyrenes; Spectrum analysis; Viscosity measurement; Anisotropy decay; Association in solutions; Poly(alkyl methacrylate)s; Rotational correlation time; Solution properties; Copolymers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-18244411820

To study the enzymatic and protein characteristics of human PGIS, the enzyme was overexpressed in Spodoptera frugiperda 21 (Sf21) cells using the baculovirus expression system. PGIS was expressed in the microsomes of the infected Sf21 cells after culture in 5 μg/ml hematin-supplemented medium for 72 h. The holoenzyme was isolated from the solubilized microsomal fraction by calcium phosphate gel absorption and purified to homogeneity by DEAE-Sepharose and hydroxyapatite column chromatography. The Km and Vmax values of the purified human PGIS for PGH2 were 30 μM and 15 μmol/min/mg of protein at 24°C, respectively. The optical absorption and EPR spectra of the enzyme revealed the characteristics of a low-spin form of P450 in the oxidized state. The carbon monoxide-reduced difference spectrum, however, exhibited a peak at 418 nm rather than 450 nm. Thee addition of a PGH2 analogue, U46619, to the enzyme produced an oxygen-ligand type of the difference spectrum with maximum absorption at 407 nm and minimum absorption at 430 nm. Treatment with another PGH2 analogue, U44069, produced a peak at 387 nm and a trough at 432 nm in the spectrum (Type I), while treatment with tranylcypromine, a PGIS inhibitor, produced a peak at 434 nm and a trough at 412 nm (Type II). A Cys441His mutant of the enzyme possessed no heme-binding ability or enzyme activity. Thus, we succeeded in obtaining a sufficient amount of the purified recombinant human PGIS from infected insect cells for spectral analyses that has high specific activity and the characteristics of a P450, indicating substrate specificity.","Baculovirus; CO-reduced spectrum; Cytochrome P-450; Human; Overexpression; Prostacyclin synthase","15 hydroxy 11alpha,9alpha epoxymethanoprosta 5,13 dienoic acid; calcium phosphate; carbon monoxide; cytochrome P450; cytochrome P450 8A1; hematin; heme; holoenzyme; hydroxyapatite; ligand; prostacyclin; prostacyclin synthase; prostaglandin derivative; prostaglandin H2; recombinant enzyme; sepharose; tranylcypromine; unclassified drug; absorption spectroscopy; animal cell; article; baculovirus expression system; column chromatography; electron spin resonance; enzyme activity; enzyme analysis; enzyme isolation; enzyme mechanism; enzyme purification; enzyme specificity; insect cell; Lepidoptera; nonhuman; oxidation; protein expression; spectral sensitivity; 15-Hydroxy-11 alpha,9 alpha-(epoxymethano)prosta-5,13-dienoic Acid; 6-Ketoprostaglandin F1 alpha; Animals; Baculoviridae; Cell Line; Chromatography, Ion Exchange; Chromatography, Liquid; Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; Durapatite; Electron Spin Resonance Spectroscopy; Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; Gene Expression; Humans; Intramolecular Oxidoreductases; Kinetics; Oxidation-Reduction; Point Mutation; Prostaglandin Endoperoxides, Synthetic; Prostaglandin H2; Recombinant Proteins; Spectrophotometry; Spodoptera; Thromboxane A2; Transfection; Tranylcypromine; Animalia; Insecta; Lepidoptera; Spodoptera; Spodoptera frugiperda; unidentified baculovirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2442703886

The synthesis and accumulation of extracellular matrix macromolecules may be adversely affected by a change in pH of the media during cell culture. Typically, zwitterion buffers (e.g., HEPES) are used in culture media because they can perform under both slightly acidic and alkaline conditions. However, because Chondrocytes tend to rapidly acidify the media, better pH maintenance may be achieved by utilizing additional buffering agents that operate under acidic conditions (e.g., bicarbonate). The purpose of this study was to investigate the combined effect of HEPES and sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) on extracellular pH and matrix accumulation by cultured articular Chondrocytes. Isolated bovine articular Chondrocytes were seeded on Millicell filters and cultured in HEPES-buffered media containing 0, 7, or 14 mM NaHCO3. Throughout the 4-week culture period, the extracellular pH was more neutral with increasing NaHCO3 concentration. Addition of NaHCO3 increased synthesis (140 ± 29%) and accumulation (20 ± 2%) of proteoglycans whereas collagen was unaffected. There was also an increase in tissue cellularity (41 ± 13%). Morphologically, increasing numbers of flattened cells, resembling superficial zone Chondrocytes, localized to the surface of the in vitro-tor mad tissue with increasing NaHCO3 supplementation were observed by light and transmission electron microscopy. Experiments are underway to determine whether these effects are due to pH maintenance or to the increased concentration of bicarbonate ions, which regulate intracellular pH.",,"Cartilage; Collagen; Matrix algebra; pH effects; Sodium compounds; Synthesis (chemical); Tissue; Transmission electron microscopy; Sodium carbonates; Zwitterion buffers; Macromolecules; 4 (2 hydroxyethyl) 1 piperazineethanesulfonic acid; ampholyte; bicarbonate; buffer; collagen; proteoglycan; acidification; animal cell; article; articular cartilage; cartilage cell; cattle; cell culture; cell structure; concentration response; culture medium; extracellular matrix; macromolecule; microscopy; nonhuman; pH; priority journal; tissue engineering; tissue repair; transmission electron microscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-11144244420

We used a soil from a pineapple plantation (CAM; δ 13C litter = -14.1‰) that had previously been under tropical forest (C3; δ13C soil carbon = -26.5‰). Forest derived carbon represented 'old' carbon and plantation inputs represented 'new' carbon. In order to differentiate utilization of young (&lt; 14 years) and old (&gt; 14 years) soil carbon, we measured the δ13C of respired CO 2 and microbial phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs) during a 103 day laboratory incubation. We determined community composition (PLFA and bacterial intergenic transcribed spacer (ITS) analysis) in addition to carbon degrading and nutrient releasing enzyme activities. We observed that greater quantities of older carbon were respired at higher temperatures (20 and 35°C) compared to the lower temperature (5°C). This effect could be explained by changes in microbial community composition and accompanying changes in enzyme activities that affect C degradation. Nitrogen addition stimulated the utilization of older soil carbon, possibly due to greater peroxidase activity, but microbial community composition was unaffected by this treatment. Increasing soil moisture had no effect on the utilization of older SOM, but enzyme activity typically declined. Increased oxidative enzyme activities in response to elevated temperature and nitrogen additions point to a plausible mechanism for alterations in C resource utilization patterns.","13C-PLFA; Carbon cycling; Enzyme activities; Microbial community composition; Respiration; Temperature","community composition; nitrogen; soil amendment; soil carbon; soil microorganism; soil respiration; temperature effect; Ananas comosus; Bacteria (microorganisms); cellular organisms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542350626

Since the anthrax attacks in Washington, USA in October 2001, there has been heightened awareness in the public domain regarding the transport of infectious substances. For instance, in direct response to the anthrax incident in the US, microbiology institutes in the UK that handle dangerous pathogens (like the Health Protection Agency) are registered with the national police force and are inspected regularly to ensure compliance with current legislation covering the control of these pathogens. The fear of a complete ban on the movement of infectious substances following the anthrax incident has not yet been realised, but remains a serious risk. Many countries such as the UK, USA, and Australia have introduced measures for the control, transportation, and health and safety aspects of handling and distribution of infectious materials. The national postal services of many countries do not accept infectious materials by mail. There are a limited number of courier services willing to transport dangerous goods, especially division 6.2 (infectious substances) and these services are costly. Measures can be implemented by scheme organisers to ensure best practice; for instance, by having sufficient and trained staff, with knowledge, expertise and use of computerised systems in the shipping/export department. Ensuring compliance with national and international health and safety legislation by providing safety data sheets and by carrying out product risk assessments is required to ensure transparency and to demonstrate duty of care. Organisers of microbiology EQA face uncertainty about the future survival of schemes in the current climate.

Whether or not terrestrial stocks become sinks or net sources of C over the next century will depend upon how fast and at what level we are able to stabilize carbon dioxide levels. The cost of soil C sequestration is at present relatively low compared to other C emission reduction technologies making soil C sinks an important short-term solution to be used while competing technologies are developed. However, efforts to use C sequestration in soils as CO 2 emissions offsets have faced numerous challenges. Difficulties associated with C stock validation (direct measurement) and the impermanence and saturability of soil C reservoirs raise concerns over whether soil C reservoirs are good long-term investments. Pragmatism has led to the development of indirect inventorying of the C reserves held at national and regional scales. Such indirect accounting systems will advance as validation methods are refined and as process models improve their ability to accurately predict how existing soil condition and specific land management practices will influence soil C storage and NO 2 and CH 4 emissions. Improved documentation of the value of environmental services and sustained productive potential derived from optimized land use and associated increases in soil quality will also add to the estimated value of soil C sinks. Policies must evolve simultaneously with the theoretical and technical tools needed to promote optimization of land use practices to mitigate climate change now and to minimize future contributions of soil C to atmospheric CO 2.",,"carbon sequestration; climate change; organic carbon; soil carbon; soil management; soil organic matter",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444240770

Our results identify 161 sites, or 18% of the county study area outside of incorporated urban areas, that have topographic and soil conditions productive for forest growth, and 21% of the mapped area is on transitional (uncultivated and undeveloped) lands that are potentially available for restorative management. The study strongly supports the planned protection of lands along stream corridors; 43% of the transitional lands ranked high potential are within a 100 m stream buffer and 80% are within a 500 m buffer. It also reveals ""gaps"" between the predicted carbon conservation map and regional plans for conservation, particularly showing the need to consider incorporating woodlots into privately owned farms on flat uplands with deep soil profiles.

PCC 6803 possesses multiple inorganic carbon (Ci) uptake systems that are regulated by Ci availability. The control mechanisms of these systems and their integration with other cell functions remain to be clarified. An analysis of the changes in global gene expression in response to Ci downshift and the inactivation of ndhR (sll1594), a LysR family regulator of Ci uptake is presented in this report. Mild Ci limitation (3% CO2 (v/v) in air to air alone) induced a dramatic up-regulation of genes encoding both inducible CO2 and HCO3- uptake systems. An induction of ndhD5/ndhD6 and other genes in a probable transcriptional unit was observed, suggesting a function in inducible Ci uptake. The expression of slr1513 and sll1735, physically clustered with sbtA and ndhF3/ndhD3/cupA, respectively, were also coordinated with upstream genes encoding the essential components for HCO3- and CO 2 uptake. Ci limitation induced the regulatory genes slr1214, sll1292, slr1594, sigD, sigG, and sigH, among which slr1214, a two-component response regulator, showed the earliest induction, implying a role for the early response to Ci limitation. Opposite regulation of genes encoding the assimilation of carbon and nitrogen demonstrated a striking coordination of expression to balance C- and N-fluxes. The analyses revealed that ndhR inactivation up-regulated the expression of sbtA/sbtB, ndhF3/ndhD3/cupA/sll1735, and slr2006-13 including ndhD5 and ndhD6, indicating a vital role of this regulatory gene in both CO2 and HCO3- acquisition of the cyanobacterium. We therefore suggest that ndhR be renamed ccmR to better represent its broader regulatory characteristics.",,"Bacteria; Cells; Genes; Gene expression; Two component response regulator; Biochemistry; bicarbonate; carbon; carbon dioxide; nitrogen; article; bacterial gene; carbon utilization; Cyanobacterium; gene cluster; gene control; gene expression; gene inactivation; gene induction; genetic transcription; ndhR gene; nitrogen fixation; nonhuman; priority journal; regulator gene; regulatory mechanism; sigD gene; sigG gene; sigH gene; sll1292 gene; sll1735 gene; slr1214 gene; slr1513 gene; slr1594 gene; Synechocystis; Bacterial Proteins; Base Sequence; Carbon; Carbon Compounds, Inorganic; Carbon Dioxide; Cyanobacteria; DNA; Down-Regulation; Gene Deletion; Gene Expression Regulation; Models, Biological; Molecular Sequence Data; Mutation; Oligonucleotide Array Sequence Analysis; Oligonucleotides; Open Reading Frames; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; RNA; Sequence Homology, Nucleic Acid; Signal Transduction; Time Factors; Transcription Factors; Up-Regulation; Bacteria (microorganisms); Negibacteria; Synechocystis; Synechocystis sp.; Synechocystis sp.

In this paper, the latest progress in regional climate modeling studies is reviewed, including RCM development, applications of RCMs to dynamical downscaling for climate change assessment and seasonal climate predictions, climate process studies, and the study of regional climate predictability. Challenges and potent ial directions of future research in this important area are discussed, with focus on those that have received less attention previously, such as the importance of ensemble simulations, further development and improvement of the regional climate modeling approach, modeling extreme climate events and sub-daily variation of clouds and precipitation, model evaluation and diagnostics, applications of RCMs to climate process studies and seasonal predictions, and development of regional earth system models. It is believed that with the demonstrated credibility of RCMs in reproducing not only monthly to seasonal mean climate and interannual variability, but also the extreme climate events when driven by good quality reanalysis and continuous improvements in the skill of global general circulation models (GCMs) in simulating large-scale atmospheric circulation, regional climate modeling will remain an important dynamical downscaling tool for providing the needed information for assessing climate change impacts, and seasonal climate predictions, and a powerful tool for improving our understanding of regional climate processes. Internationally coordinated efforts can be developed to further advance regional climate modeling studies. It is also recognized that since the final quality of the results from nested RCMs depends in part on the realism of the large-scale forcing provided by GCMs, the reduction of errors and improvement in physics parameterizations in both GCMs and RCMs remain a priority for the climate modeling community. © 2004, Meteorological Society of Japan.",,"atmospheric circulation; climate modeling; extreme event; long range forecast; regional climate",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-13844275392

Evolutionary responses to CO2 may alter plant physiology, development rate, growth, and reproduction in ways that cannot be predicted from single generation studies. Moreover, ecological and evolutionary changes in plant communities will have a range of consequences at higher spatial scales and may cause substantial deviations from ecosystem level predictions based on short-term responses to elevated CO2. Therefore, steps need to be taken to identify the plant traits that are most likely to evolve at elevated CO2, and to understand how these changes may affect net primary productivity within ecosystems. These processes may range in scale from molecular and physiological changes that occur among genotypes at the individual and population levels, to changes in community- and ecosystem-level productivity that result from the integrative effects of different plant species evolving simultaneously. In this review, we (1) synthesize recent studies investigating the role of atmospheric CO2 as a selective agent on plants, (2) discuss possible control points during plant development that may change in response to selection at elevated CO2 with an emphasis at the primary molecular level, and (3) provide a quantitative framework for scaling the evolutionary effects of CO2 on plants in order to determine changes in community and ecosystem productivity. Furthermore, this review points out that studies integrating the effects of plant evolution in response to elevated CO 2 are lacking, and therefore more attention needs be devoted to this issue among the global change research community.","Arabidopsis; Carbon gain; Elevated CO2, global change; Net primary productivity; Photosynthesis; Scaling","carbon dioxide enrichment; evolution; global change; net primary production; plant community; Arabidopsis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2542483050

Changes in the modeled surface energy budget strengthen the monsoon and increase rainfall over the entire continent. Modeled surface temperatures increase in the southern, climatologically drier, regions but decrease in the north. The degree of similarity with the observed rainfall and temperature trends suggests that the strengthening of the monsoon, is independent of changes over the ocean but may be due to changes over the land, highlighting potential sensitivity to changes in climate.

Sciences, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY 12180, United States","Interdiffusion coefficients have been determined for H2O-CO2 mixtures by quantifying the flux of CO2 between two fluid-filled chambers in a specially designed piston-cylinder cell. The two chambers, which are maintained at 1.0 GPa and at temperatures differing by ∼100°C, each contain the XCO2-buffering assemblage calcite + quartz + wollastonite, in H2O. The positive dependence of XCO2 on temperature results in a down-temperature, steady-state flux of CO2 through a capillary tube that connects the two chambers. This flux drives the wollastonite = calcite + quartz equilibrium to the right in the cooler chamber, producing a measurable amount of calcite that is directly related to CO2 -H2O interdiffusion rates. Diffusivities calculated from seven experiments range from 1.0 × 10-8 to 6.1 × 10-8 m2/s for mean capillary temperatures between ∼490 and 690°C. The data set can be approximated by an Arrhenius-type relation: D=4.7×10-6 exp(-4560/T) m2/s (T in K), which yields values within a factor of 2 of, but slightly lower than, diffusivities estimated by application of the Stokes-Einstein relation.Because rates of H2O and CO2 interdiffusion approach (within 1 to 2 orders of magnitude) rates of heat conduction in rocks, rapid CO2-H2O interdiffusion should be expected in deep-seated fluids wherever gradients in XCO2 are imposed by contrasting mineral assemblages. Considering the small-scale heterogeneity of the crust, strong gradients in XCO2 are probably quite common, particularly where different carbonate-bearing assemblages are juxtaposed or where they are interlayered with carbonate-absent rocks. Cross-layer, diffusive mass transfer of CO2 and H2O may play an important role in driving dehydration and decarbonation reactions, even in the absence of fluid flow. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.",,"carbon dioxide; diffusion; hydrothermal fluid; metamorphism; water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642546434

This river drains the forested lowlands south of a relatively large reservoir lake, Lake Livingston. A weak relationship between dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and QTR indicated hydrologic control but separation of the data, based on individual discharge events, was necessary to improve interpretation. For instance, the first rain of the season resulted in only a modest increase in DOC concentrations and led to an inverse relationship with discharge, due to decreased lateral flow and increased infiltration of rainwater, with the lower flows being more efficient at DOC leaching from soils. In contrast, a long duration high discharge river crest event resulted in an opposite trend, i.e. a linear increase in DOC with increasing discharge rates. A short duration high discharge tropical storm showed reduced Trinity River DOC concentrations and the highest POC concentrations measured, likely resulting from the relatively short duration, and minimal contact time, of this event. In contrast to DOC, the concentrations of particulate organic carbon, POC (mg C l-1) were linearly correlated to suspended particulate matter (SPM) concentrations and accounted for between 10 and 12% of the total suspended load at low discharge but decreased to ∼2% at high discharge. This suggests dilution by larger particles with a reduced organic carbon content, possibly silicate minerals, more readily resuspended at elevated levels of discharge. The annual total organic carbon (TOC) load to Galveston Bay, estimated from the slope of the daily load vs. discharge relationship, was 11.2×10 10 g C and calculated export coefficients (g C m-2 year-1) were in good agreement with previous results. Using this relationship, accurate assessments of TOC flux inputs to Galveston Bay over the past quarter-century and in the future are possible by obtaining annual Trinity River discharge rates, which are readily available from the USGS. Comparing DOC riverine inputs to benthic sources in Trinity Bay, measured directly on the same day, indicates that the sediments contribute approximately 20% of total inputs of DOC to Trinity Bay. However, assuming a constant benthic source during low-flow conditions, which can occur for periods of up to 14 months in this region of Texas, benthic fluxes would account for &gt;80% of the total inputs into Trinity Bay. At high levels of discharge, the Trinity River discharges ∼1.0×109 g C day-1 and dominates DOC inputs to Trinity Bay. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The remnant is very round in shape, with a distinct clumpy, shell-like structure that extends to an average radius of 14″.8 (3.6 pc) in the X-ray band. Our Chandra data reveal the remnant to be rich in silicon, sulfur, and iron. The yields of our fits to the global spectrum confirm that 0509-67.5 is the remnant of an SN la and show a clear preference for delayed-detonation explosion models for SNe Ia. The Chandra spectra extracted from radial rings are in general quite similar; the most significant variation with radius is a drop in the equivalent widths of the strong emission lines right at the edge of the remnant. We study the spectrum of the single brightest isolated knot in the remnant and find that it is enhanced in iron by a factor of roughly 2 relative to the global remnant abundances. This feature, along with similar knots seen in Tycho's SNR, argues for the presence of modest small-scale composition inhomogeneities in SNe Ia. The presence of both Si and Fe, with abundance ratios that vary from knot to knot, indicates that these came from the transition region between the Si- and Fe-rich zones in the exploded star, possibly as a result of energy input to the ejecta at late times because of the radioactive decay of 56Ni and 56Co. Two cases for the continuum emission from the global spectrum were modeled: one in which the continuum is dominated by hydrogen thermal bremsstrahlung radiation, the other in which the continuum arises from non-thermal synchrotron radiation. The former case requires a relatively large value for the ambient density (∼1 cm -3). Another estimate of the ambient density comes from using the shell structure of the remnant in the context of dynamical models. This requires a much lower value for the density (&lt;0.05 cm-3) that is more consistent with other evidence known about 0509-67.5. We therefore conclude that the bulk of the continuum emission from 0509-67.5 has a nonthermal origin.","ISM: individual (SNR 0509-67.5); Nuclear reactions, nucleosynthesis, abundances; Supernova remnants; Supernovae: general; X-rays: ISM",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3142735905

In order to obtain a leading low-frequency mode of the model atmosphere, singular vector analysis is performed on the linear dynamical operator. The singular mode (v vector) with the smallest singular value, referred to as the neutral mode, has a considerable similarity to the observed AO in many aspects, suggesting that, at least in a linear dynamical framework, the AO is a dynamically consistent mode of variability that arises from the zonal asymmetry of the time-mean state. Diagnosis of the neutral mode shows that a zonal flow-stationary wave interaction and an interaction between anomalous and climatological stationary waves are both of importance for maintenance of the spatial structure. Besides, vortex stretching-shrinking is significant in the upper levels, which indicates that a baroclinic process has a certain role as well. It is found that the formation of a hemispheric scale of the neutral mode is accomplished within several days via propagation of Rossby wave packets along jet streams that act as a waveguide. The neutral mode structure is robust for a wide range of model damping parameters, and especially preferred when the damping is weakened in the free troposphere. The corresponding optimal forcing (u vector) indicates that, though its robustness is relatively ambiguous, the neutral mode is most effectively excited by a certain pattern of the extratropical thermal forcing, in addition to a modest sensitivity to the deep heating anomaly over the tropical Indian Ocean. © 2004 American Meteorologicsl Society.",,"Barometers; Heating; Oscillations; Parameter estimation; Troposphere; Vectors; Dynamical prototypes; Equation models; Climatology; Arctic Oscillation; baroclinic motion; numerical model; Rossby wave; vortex; wave propagation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042787740

The past ice ages are proof of the great adaptive capacity of our kind. Anthropogenic climate change will happen – and, if unabated – with catastrophic consequences. More extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and a hotter and drier climate are some of the predicted outcomes seriously affecting people’s choice of where to live on an increasingly crowded planet. Climate–induced migration is not new, as already in the past people moved when faced by environmental change; but today, population densities have increased dramatically, and arable land has become more limited. Large cross–border streams of ‘climate migrants’ or ‘environmental refugees’ caused by tropical cyclones, associated flooding and landslides, droughts, and sea–level rise could trigger resource competition with violent outcomes in the receiving country or region. But can these claims be substantiated? This chapter examines different types of natural hazards relevant for climate–induced migration, and argues that without an analysis identifying the people most vulnerable to natural hazards (for example, where they live and how they are affected), it is difficult to access the conflict potential of climate-induced migration. © Cambridge University Press 2012.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84925653785

Xanthi) had a profound effect on the volatile emissions of intact and crushed leaves. BGL1 was expressed under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus (CaMV) 35S promoter and targeted to the cytoplasm, cell wall, lytic vacuole (LV), chloroplast or endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Subcellular localization was confirmed by gold immunolabelling, followed by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Significant β-glucosidase activity was observed in transgenic plants expressing BGL1 in the cell wall, LV and ER. Compared with controls, all intact transgenic leaves were found to emit increased levels of 2-ethylhexanol, as determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis of the headspace volatiles. Plants expressing BGL1 in the cell wall (Tcw) emitted more trans-caryophyllene than did non-transgenic controls, whereas plants expressing BGL1 in the ER (Ter) and LV (Tvc) emitted more cembrene than did non-transgenic controls. Volatiles released from crushed transgenic leaves and collected with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) polydimethylsiloxane fibre were distinctly enhanced. Significant increases in linalool, nerol, furanoid cis-linalool oxide, 4-methyl-1-pentanol, 6-methyl-hept-5-en-2-ol and 2-ethylhexanol were detected in transgenic plants when compared with wild-type controls. 3-Hydroxyl-β-ionone levels were increased in crushed Tcw and Ter leaves, but were undetectable in Tvc leaves. The addition of glucoimidazole, a β-glucosidase inhibitor, abolished the increased emission of these volatiles. These results indicate that the expression of a fungal β-glucosidase gene in different subcellular compartments has the potential to affect the emission of plant volatiles, and thereby to modify plant-environment communication and aroma of agricultural products.","β-glucosidase; Compartmentation; Glycosides; Headspace; Scent; Volatiles","Aspergillus; Aspergillus niger; Brassica oleracea var. botrytis; Cauliflower mosaic virus; Nicotiana; Nicotiana tabacum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4744342939

Usually it's loss of farmland, blighted downtowns, and longer commutes that drive the smart growth agenda. In Bakersfield, California, residents are reluctantly waking up to the need for a new approach to urban planning that minimizes air pollution. Last year the American Lung Association ranked Bakersfield as having the third-worst air quality in the nation. The city is part of the federally designated San Joaquin Valley air basin, the largest in the nation and the one with the second-worst air quality in the U.S., behind only the notoriously smog-blurred Los Angeles region. The region is blessed with an abundance of affordable land and a dependable water supply, unlike many areas of California. And with double-digit unemployment straining the region for decades, politicians have been reluctant to impose new development standards, fearing they would harm the construction industry. So, until now, there have been few incentives for smart growth in Bakersfield (pop. 266,000), California's 12th largest city. Local development codes contain no requirements for compact growth, mixed-use development, or even pedestrian-friendly neighborhood design. The typical new Bakersfield housing subdivision is a network of looping streets and cul de sacs, with high sound walls sealing off each neighborhood from the next. Local leaders have found little reason to change this pattern, and they continue to question planning's role in improving air quality.",,"atmospheric pollution; pollution control; urban development; urban growth; urban planning; Bakersfield; California; North America; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642581718

In contrast to both ""state-centered"" and ""society-centered"" views of the relationship among social classes, state structures, and public policies, an historical-institutional theoretical frame reveals that social forces and political institutions are reciprocally constitutive, and that policy outcomes emerge from their interaction.

First, there has been an increased incidence of intervention for humanitarian purposes since the end of the Cold War. In these cases, the alleged conflict between sovereignty and human rights has been addressed in one of two ways: through an evolution in the notion of sovereignty, from 'sovereignty as authority' to 'sovereignty as responsibility'; and through an expanded definition of what constitutes a threat to international peace and security under Chapter VII of the UN Charter. Second, despite this new climate of permissiveness, humanitarian intervention remains a controversial norm in international relations -largely because of continued opposition from certain members of international society, and concerns about its potentially negative consequences. Third, while the post Cold War period has seen some successful cases of intervention to address humanitarian catastrophes, the current capability of international organizations to undertake humanitarian interventions remains limited. Indeed, as the book demonstrates, the issue of humanitarian intervention has the potential to divide international institutions such as the UN and damage their credibility. © Oxford University Press, 2014.","Authorization; Chapter VII (United Nations Charter); CNN effect; Consent; Human rights violations; Humanitarian intervention; Sovereignty; Sovereignty as responsibility; Unilateral intervention; United Nations Security Council",,Editorial,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84922761269

Three small-to-medium river subbasins following roughly along a longitude in the Colorado River basin with different El Niño-Southern Oscillation signals were chosen as test basins. Historical ensemble forecasts of the spring runoff for each basin were generated using modeled hydrologic states and historical precipitation and temperature observations using the Ensemble Streamflow Prediction (ESP) component of the NWSRFS. Two general methods for using a climate index (e.g., Niño-3.4) are presented. The first method, post-ESP, uses the climate index to weight ensemble members from ESP. Four different post-ESP weighting schemes are presented. The second method, preadjustment, uses the climate index to modify the temperature and precipitation ensembles used in ESP. Two preadjustment methods are presented. This study shows the distance-sensitive nearest-neighbor post-ESP to be superior to the other post-ESP weighting schemes. Further, for the basins studied, forecasts based on post-ESP techniques outperformed those based on preadjustment techniques. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"El Nino-Southern Oscillation; ensemble forecasting; forecasting method; hydrometeorology; river basin; runoff; streamflow; Colorado Basin; North America; Western Hemisphere; World",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-12144253814

Results suggest that climate forecasts can facilitate flood planning when used by public and private policy entrepreneurs to build political support for flood mitigation measures. Understanding the social processes and regulatory machinery involved in applying these forecasts is critical to their more effective use.

First, existing studies of emissions reduction measures-PROAIRE (the air quality plan for Mexico City) and separate GHG studies-are used to construct a harmonized database of options. Second, linear programming (LP) is developed and applied as a decision-support tool to analyze least-cost strategies for meeting co-control targets for multiple pollutants. We estimate that implementing PROAIRE measures as planned will reduce 3.1% of the 2010 metropolitan CO2 emissions, in addition to substantial local air pollutant reductions. Applying the LP, PROAIRE emissions reductions can be met at a 20% lower cost, using only the PROAIRE measures, by adjusting investments toward the more cost-effective measures; lower net costs are possible by including cost-saving GHG mitigation measures, but with increased investment. When CO2 emission reduction targets are added to PROAIRE targets, the most cost-effective solutions use PROAIRE measures for the majority of local pollutant reductions, and GHG measures for additional CO2 control. Because of synergies, the integrated planning of urban-global co-control can be beneficial, but we estimate that for Mexico City these benefits are often small.",,"Air pollution; Costs; Greenhouses; Impurities; Strategic planning; Emission reduction; Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission; Environmental engineering; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; hydrocarbon; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; greenhouse gas; pollution control; air pollution; air quality standard; article; climate change; cost effectiveness analysis; data base; decision support system; exhaust gas; greenhouse gas; Mexico; pollution control; urban area; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Carbon Dioxide; City Planning; Databases, Factual; Government Regulation; Greenhouse Effect; Mexico; Models, Theoretical; Nitrogen Compounds; Public Policy; Federal District [Mexico]; Mexico [North America]; Mexico City; North America",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042753803

In neat CO 2, the emission maximum of AP shifts to the red upon density increase because of the increase of average number of solvent molecules interacting with the probe. In CO 2-ethanol mixtures of different ethanol densities (0.025 and 0.125 M) the tendency upon CO 2 density increase is opposite. In mixtures, the CO 2 density increase, also increases the probability of exchange of the ethanol molecules interacting with AP by CO 2 molecules. This causes a blue shift that is bigger than the red shift caused by density increase. In all the cases, emission spectra were time independent in the nanosecond time range. This allowed to take solvation effects into account using a Langmuir adsorption model, under equilibrium conditions. This is the simplest association model that can semiquantitative describe the results and can successfully explain the lack of solvation entropic effects in emission of AP in the mixtures near the critical density of CO 2. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

Plant leaf area was determined non-destructively at 7 day intervals until the time of bulbing in 12 combinations of temperature and CO2 concentration. Gas exchange was measured in each plot at the time of bulbing, and the carbohydrate content of the leaf (source) and bulb (sink) was determined. Maximum rate of leaf area expansion increased with mean temperature. Leaf area duration and maximum rate of leaf area expansion were not significantly affected by CO 2. The light-saturated rates of leaf photosynthesis (Asat) were greater in plants grown at normal than at elevated CO2 concentrations at the same measurement CO2 concentration. Acclimation of photosynthesis decreased with an increase in growth temperature, and with an increase in leaf nitrogen content at elevated CO2. The ratio of intercellular to atmospheric CO2 (Ci/Ca ratio) was 7.4% less for plants grown at elevated compared with normal CO2. Asat in plants grown at elevated CO2 was less than in plants grown at normal CO2 when compared at the same Ci. Hence, acclimation of photosynthesis was due both to stomatal acclimation and to limitations to biochemical CO2 fixation. Carbohydrate content of the onion bulbs was greater at elevated than at normal CO2. In contrast, carbohydrate content was less at elevated compared with normal CO2 in the leaf sections in which CO2 exchange was measured at the same developmental stage. Therefore, acclimation of photosynthesis in fully expanded onion leaves was detected despite the absence of localised carbohydrate accumulation in these field-grown crops. © 2004 Association of Applied Biologists.","Acclimation; CO2; Onion; Photosynthesis; Temperature","acclimation; carbon dioxide enrichment; photosynthesis; temperature; Allium cepa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-28244499271

These management strategies encompass reductions in atmospheric emissions and deposition of N from sources including, fossil fuel burning utility emissions and mobile NOx emissions, N treatment in wastewater and controls on agricultural N inputs. We find that in primarily urban watersheds biological removal of N in wastewater treatment produces the greatest reduction in N loading (32-57% reductions), while in less urban watersheds, reductions in agricultural loading are more effective (5-56% reductions) in decreasing N loads to coastal ecosystems. Because anthropogenic N inputs are derived from a variety of sources, we also examined an integrated scenario targeting all major N sources; this resulted in 35-58% reductions in N loading. Nitrogen pollution originates from multiple sources and is transported through several media (air, soil, water); a major challenge of the development of N management strategies will be the control of multiple sources to effectively reduce N loads to estuaries. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The two-photon cross-sections at 503 and 566 nm are 7.4 × 10−50 and 0.37 × 10−50 cm4 s photon−1 mol−1, respectively, which compare favourably with values reported for the green fluorescent protein.

Considerable uncertainty about the future also exists, partly because of the response of society's apparent reluctance to mitigate climate change by reducing fossil fuel consumption. An adaptive response to the challenge draws on the literature on climate change, the urban environment, natural hazards and risk analysis. Two concepts - life cycle costs and the avoidance of ruin - provide a useful framework for factoring the uncertainty associated with climate change into a risk analysis for the built environment. Monitoring, prediction, data management and communication are the unglamorous underpinnings of a successful urban risk-management strategy.

Box 4, Klong Luang, Pathumthani 12120, Thailand","Sri Lanka has a hydropower dominated power system with approximately two thirds of its generation capacity based on large hydro plants. The remaining one third are based on oil fired thermal generation with varying technologies, such as oil steam, Diesel, gas turbines and combined cycle plants. A significant portion of this capacity is in operation as independent power plants (IPPs). In addition to these, Sri Lanka presently has about 40 MWs of mini-hydro plants, which are distributed in the highlands and their surrounding districts, mainly connected to the primary distribution system. Further, there are a few attempts to build fuel wood fired power plants of small capacities and connect them to the grid in various parts of the country. The study presented in this paper investigates the impact of these new developments in the power sector on the overall emissions and the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in particular. It examines the resulting changes to the emissions and costs in the event of developing the proposed coal power plant as an IPP under different investment and operational conditions. The paper also examines the impact on emissions with 80 MWs of distributed power in different capacities of wind, mini-hydro and wood fired power plants. It is concluded that grid connected, distributed power generation (DPG) reduces emissions, with only a marginal increase in overall costs, due to the reduction in transmission and distribution network losses that result from the distributed nature of generation. These reductions can be enhanced by opting for renewable energy based DPGs, as the case presented in the paper, and coupling them with demand side management measures. It is also concluded that there is no impact on overall emissions by the base load IPPs unless they are allowed to change over to different fuel types and technologies. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

We assessed the ability of the species to alter its gas exchange characteristics, leaf physical attributes, and water-use efficiency of foliar carbon assimilation (WUE i) or of total dry matter production (WUE DM). Stomatal conductance (g s) varied five-fold between treatment means, with coppices exhibiting greatest values and mature bush least. Photosynthetic rates followed this trend. Leaf photosynthetic capacity estimated by chlorophyll content varied 1.3-fold parallel with variations in leaf thickness, with coppices rating lowest and mature edge trees most highly. WUE i varied 1.5-fold between treatments and was greatest in mature inner-bush and edge trees. Leaf photosynthetic capacity and g s were both correlated with WUE i. Carbon isotope composition ( 13C values) of new shoot dry matter produced early in a seasonal flush were similar to those of root starch but when averaged over the whole season correlated well with WUE i and gas exchange characteristics of trees of each treatment. Coppices showed poorest WUE i and most negative shoot tip 13C but their WUE DM was high. This discrepancy was suggested to relate to carbon allocation strategies in coppices favouring fast growth of replacement shoots but not of roots. Physiology of coppice growth of E. kochii is usefully geared towards both rapid and water-use efficient production of woody biomass in water limited environments.","alley farming; carbon isotope composition; carbon partitioning; semi-arid environment; starch utilization; stomatal conductance","bushland; coppice; stomatal conductance; tree; water use efficiency; Australasia; Australia; Kalannie; Western Australia; Eucalyptus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344654134

The U.S. Department of Energy and private enterprise are developing technology necessary to use high-cellulose feedstock, such as crop residues, for ethanol production. Corn (Zea mays L.) residue can provide about 1.7 times more C than barley (Hordeum vulgare L.), oat (Avena sativa L.), sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench], soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) residues based on production levels. Removal of crop residue from the field must be balanced against impacting the environment (soil erosion), maintaining soil organic matter levels, and preserving or enhancing productivity. Our objective is to summarize published works for potential impacts of wide-scale, corn stover collection on corn production capacity in Corn Belt soils. We address the issue of crop yield (sustainability) and related soil processes directly. However, scarcity of data requires us to deal with the issue of greenhouse gases indirectly and by inference. All ramifications of new management practices and crop uses must be explored and evaluated fully before an industry is established. Our conclusion is that within limits, corn stover can be harvested for ethanol production to provide a renewable, domestic source of energy that reduces greenhouse gases. Recommendation for removal rates will vary based on regional yield, climatic conditions, and cultural practices. Agronomists are challenged to develop a procedure (tool) for recommending maximum permissible removal rates that ensure sustained soil productivity.",,"Agricultural wastes; Agronomy; Cellulose; Climatology; Erosion; Ethanol fuels; Greenhouse effect; Harvesting; Management; Renewable energy resources; Soils; Crop yield; Crops; Avena; Avena sativa; Glycine max; Helianthus; Helianthus annuus; Hordeum; Hordeum vulgare; Hordeum vulgare subsp. vulgare; Sorghum bicolor; Triticum; Triticum aestivum; Zea; Zea mays",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-0742302383

Through precision image alignment using globular cluster X-ray sources, we are able to improve constraints on possible optical/X-ray associations suggested by previous surveys. Our image registration allows us to rule out several emission-line objects, previously suggested to be the optical counterparts of X-ray sources, as true counterparts. At the same time, we find six X-ray sources peculiarly close to strong [O III] emission-line sources, classified as planetary nebulae (PNs) by previous optical surveys. Our study shows that, while the X-rays are not coming from the same gas as the optical line emission, the chances of these six X-ray sources lying so close to cataloged PNs is only ∼1%, suggesting that there is some connection between these [O III] emitters (possibly PNs) and the X-ray sources. We discuss the possibility that these nebulae are misidentified supernova remnants, and we rule out the possibility that the X-ray sources are ejected X-ray binaries. There is a possibility that some cases involve a PN and a low-mass X-ray binary that occupy the same undetected star cluster. Beyond this unconfirmed possibility and the statistically unlikely one that the associations are spatial coincidences, we are unable to explain these [O III]/X-ray associations.","Astrometry; Galaxies: individual (M31); Planetary nebulae: general; Supernova remnants; X-rays: general",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-9344248992

NETL is partnering with Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in developing new directions in research under the Solid-State Energy Conversion Alliance (SECA) initiative for the development and commercialization of modular, low cost, and fuel flexible SOFC systems. The SECA initiative, through advanced materials, processing and system integration research and development, will bring the fuel cell cost to $400 per kilowatt (kW) for stationary and auxiliary power unit (APU) markets. The President of the U.S. has launched us into a new hydrogen economy. The logic of a hydrogen economy is compelling. The movement to a hydrogen economy will accomplish several strategic goals. The U.S. can use its own domestic resources - solar, wind, hydro, and coal. The U.S. uses 20 percent of the world's oil but has only 3 percent of resources. Also. the U.S. can reduce green house gas emissions. Clear Skies and Climate Change initiatives aim to reduce carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. SOFCs have no emissions, so they figure significantly in these DOE strategies. In addition, DG - SOFCs, reforming, energy storage has significant benefit for enhanced security and reliability. The use of fuel cells in cars is expected to bring about the hydrogen economy. However, commercialization of fuel cells is expected to proceed first through portable and stationary applications. This logic says to develop SOFCs for a wide range of stationary and APU applications, initially for conventional fuels, then switch to hydrogen. Like all fuel cells, the SOFC will operate even better on hydrogen than conventional fuels. The SOFC hybrid is a key part of the FutureGen plants. FutureGen is a major new Presidential initiative to produce hydrogen from coal. The highly efficient SOFC hybrid plant will produce electric power and other parts of the plant could produce hydrogen and sequester CO2. The hydrogen produced can be used in fuel cell cars and for SOFC DG applications.

Karst] and silver fir (Abies alba Mill) in the Lower Bavarian Forest region in southern Germany. These chronologies were compiled, using both historic and living tree-ring data, with the main aim of developing a dendroclimatic reconstruction for the region covering the last 500 years. Moving window correlation analysis shows that prior to the twentieth century, both species co-vary in a similar way (1480-1899 mean r =0.66). There is no significant correlation between the species chronologies since ca. 1930, which partly reflects anomalous growth trends in the fir chronology since ca. 1960. Multiple regression analysis was utilised to assess the ability of both species chronologies to model March-August precipitation. The precipitation signal of the spruce data was found to be both stronger than the fir data (1872-1930 calibration: r 2=0.45 vs 0.25) and more time stable. After ca. 1930, the fir chronology loses it ability to model March-August precipitation until there is no climate signal at all in the fir data in recent decades. The spruce data also express a later weakening in their climate signal in the mid 1970s. We present compelling evidence indicating that the anomalous trends observed in the fir data, since the mid 1960s, appear to be predominantly related to local SO2 emissions from power plants and refineries. It is also likely that this local anthropogenic forcing is the cause of the weakening of the climate signal in the spruce data since the mid 1970s. The conclusions from this study are: (1) The fir tree-ring data cannot be used for traditional dendroclimatic calibration, although prior to the twentieth century the decadal variability in the fir data is very similar to spruce and so these data could be used to extend potential reconstructions in the future; (2) The recent decline and recovery event in the fir data appears to be unique to the twentieth century and is not part of a natural episodic phenomenon; (3) Traditional dendroclimatic calibration of March-August precipitation will be made using solely the spruce ring-width data. However, due to SO2 forcing in recent decades, the calibration period will be shortened to the 1871-1978 period.","Bavarian Forest; Dendroclimatology; Forest decline; Germany; Response change","Climate change; Correlation methods; Data reduction; Industrial emissions; Power plants; Precipitation (meteorology); Regression analysis; Tempoarl stability; Forestry; Abies; Abies alba; Picea; Picea abies",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1642441362

There has been concern about potential perverse incentives for developing countries like South Africa not to adopt progressive national policies, fearing that CDM projects implementing such policy would no longer be additional. The CDM rules on additionality require that emissions are reduced 'below those that would have occurred in the absence of the registered CDM project activity'. The paper shows that recent decisions by the CDM Executive Board make it clear that such perverse incentives will not be created. The paper suggests concrete interpretations of this guidance for two possible project types. Projects implementing national policies that promote zero- or low-carbon emission technologies (e.g. South Africa's renewable energy target) can still go through the CDM process. Where there are local regulations, as for landfill gas, projects would not be ruled out entirely, but would receive credit for the difference between actual methane capture and that needed to meet local safety, health and environmental standards. The author concludes that projects implementing progressive energy policies are still eligible for CDM investment.","CDM Executive Board; Clean Development Mechanism; Renewable energy projects; South Africa","Clean development mechanism (CDM); Executive Board; Renewable energy projects; South Africa; Carbon; Climate change; Developing countries; Energy management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse effect; Investments; Laws and legislation; Methane; Project management; Standards; Sustainable development; Public policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-14644406289

Analysis includes measurements of photosynthesis, respiration, stomatal conductance, water potential, stable carbon isotope values, and biogenic hydrocarbon emissions from Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla), and western red cedar (Thuja plicata). Leaf-level information is used to scale fluxes up to the canopy to estimate gross primary production using a physiology-based process model. Both light-saturated and in situ photosynthesis exhibit pronounced vertical gradients through the canopy, but are consistently highest in Douglas-fir, intermediate in western hemlock, and lowest in western red cedar. Net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance are strongly dependent on vapor-pressure deficit in Douglas-fir, and decline through the course of a seasonal drought. Foliar respiration is similar for Douglas-fir and western hemlock, and lowest for western red cedar. Water-use efficiency varied with species and tree height, as indexed using stable carbon isotopes values for foliage. Leaf water potential is most negative for Douglas-fir and similar for western hemlock and western red cedar. Terpene fluxes from foliage equal approximately 1 % of the net carbon loss from the forest. Modeled estimates based on physiological measurements show gross primary productivity (GPP) to be about 22 Mg C m-2 y-1. Physiological studies will be necessary to further refine estimates of stand-level carbon balance and to make long-term predictions of changes in carbon balance due to changes in forest structure, species composition, and climate.","Biogenic carbon emissions; Canopy processes; Forest carbon budget; Forest gas exchange; Old-growth canopy","canopy; carbon balance; coniferous forest; gas exchange; old-growth forest; primary production; water use efficiency; North America; United States; Washington [United States]; Wind River Experimental Forest; Abies; Coniferophyta; Conium; Conium maculatum; Juniperus virginiana; Pseudotsuga; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Pseudotsuga menziesii; Thuja; Thuja plicata; Thuja plicata; Tsuga; Tsuga heterophylla; Tsuga heterophylla",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4243080656

In this investigation, we examined in detail how soil CO2 efflux differs both spatially and temporally with respect to stand age for loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) plantations on the Virginia Piedmont. Throughout a 12-month period, efflux rates were measured both near the base of trees and midway between planting rows in stands of four age classes. Mean soil CO2 efflux rates measured during the 12-month study were 1.72, 2.58, 2.84, and 2.90μmol/m2/s for 1- to 2-year-old, 4- to 6-year-old, 8- to 12-year-old, and 20- to 25-year-old stands, respectively. Time series analysis revealed that stand age had a significant effect on soil CO2 efflux rate. Additionally, mean efflux rates were consistently higher near the tree and time series analysis revealed that measurement position had a significant effect on soil CO2 efflux rate. Mean soil CO2 efflux rates, by position, for the 12-month study were 2.72 and 2.28μmol/m2/s for the near and away measurement positions, respectively. Regression analysis was used to examine the influence of soil and climatic factors on seasonal changes in soil CO2 efflux. The most influential factors affecting soil CO2 efflux during the 12-month study were soil temperature, soil moisture, stand age, and measurement position. We believe respiring roots significantly influence soil CO2 efflux of plantation loblolly pine and account for differences observed between stands of different ages as well as spatial differences observed within a given stand. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

In the present study, Pb contamination of urban soil cores in Hong Kong was investigated using a combination of the 'total' concentration, chemical partitioning and isotopic composition of Pb in the soils. The analytical results showed that urban soil cores in close vicinity to high traffic volumes (&gt;40000 vehicles per day) were usually contaminated with Pb, suggesting atmospheric deposition of Pb as a consequence of vehicular emissions arising from the combustion of leaded gasoline in the past. Increasing Pb concentrations were generally associated with decreasing 206Pb/ 207Pb ratios of the contaminated soil cores, offering strong evidence of accumulation of Pb derived from anthropogenic sources. In selected contaminated soil cores, the 206Pb/207Pb ratios tended to increase in the order: carbonate&lt;exchangeable&lt;Fe-Mn oxide&lt;organic&lt; residual fractions. The distribution of the 206Pb/207Pb ratios in the five operationally defined chemical fractions showed that the 206Pb/207Pb ratios generally increased with increasing stability, demonstrating preferential association of anthropogenic Pb with the carbonate, exchangeable, Fe-Mn oxide and organic fractions in the soils. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

Evaluations of criteria air pollutants have focused on benefits and costs associated with adverse health effects. Children are significantly affected by the health benefits of improved air quality, yet key environmental health policy analyses have not previously focused specifically on children's effects. In this article we present a ""meta-analysis"" approach to child-specific health impacts derived from the U.S. Clean Air Act (CAA). On the basis of data from existing studies, reductions in criteria air pollutants predicted to occur by 2010 because of CAA regulations are estimated to produce the following impacts: 200 fewer expected cases of postneonatal mortality; 10,000 fewer asthma hospitalizations in children 1-16 years old, with estimated benefits ranging from $20 million to $46 million (1990 U.S.$); 40,000 fewer emergency department visits in children 1-16 years old, with estimated benefits ranging from $1.3 million to $5.8 million; 20 million school absences avoided by children 6-11 years old, with estimated benefits of $0.7-1.8 billion; and 10,000 fewer infants of low birth weight, with estimated benefits of $230 million. Inclusion of limited child-specific data on hospitalizations, emergency department visits, school absences, and low birth weight could be expected to add $1-2 billion (1990 US$) to the $8 billion in health benefits currently estimated to result from decreased morbidity, and $600 million to the $100 billion estimated to result from decreased mortality. These estimates highlight the need for increased consideration of children's health effects. Key needs for environmental health policy analyses include improved information for children's health effects, additional life-stage-specific information, and improved health economics information specific for children.","Air pollution; Benefit; Children; Morbidity; Mortality; Risk assessment","absenteeism; academic achievement; adolescent; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; article; asthma; child; child health; childhood mortality; cost benefit analysis; emergency ward; environmental management; health care cost; health care policy; health hazard; hospitalization; human; low birth weight; medical information; morbidity; newborn mortality; prediction; priority journal; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1042269434

Comparisons were made on the basis of a twenty-year retrospective (1975-1995) climate simulation produced by the NCAR-DOE Parallel Climate Model (PCM), and the implications of the comparison for a future (2040-2060) PCM climate scenario were also explored. The six approaches were made up of three relatively simple statistical downscaling methods - linear interpolation (LI), spatial disaggregation (SD), and bias-correction and spatial disaggregation (BCSD) - each applied to both PCM output directly (at T42 spatial resolution), and after dynamical downscaling via a Regional Climate Model (RCM - at 1/2-degree spatial resolution), for downscaling the climate model outputs to the 1/8-degree spatial resolution of the hydrological model. For the retrospective climate simulation, results were compared to an observed gridded climatology of temperature and precipitation, and gridded hydrologic variables resulting from forcing the hydrologic model with observations. The most significant findings are that the BCSD method was successful in reproducing the main features of the observed hydrometeorology from the retrospective climate simulation, when applied to both PCM and RCM outputs. Linear interpolation produced better results using RCM output than PCM output, but both methods (PCM-LI and RCM-LI) lead to unacceptably biased hydrologic simulations. Spatial disaggregation of the PCM output produced results similar to those achieved with the RCM interpolated output; nonetheless, neither PCM nor RCM output was useful for hydrologic simulation purposes without a bias-correction step. For the future climate scenario, only the BCSD-method (using PCM or RCM) was able to produce hydrologically plausible results. With the BCSD method, the RCM-derived hydrology was more sensitive to climate change than the PCM-derived hydrology.",,"Climatology; Computer simulation; Interpolation; Mathematical models; Precipitation (meteorology); Linear interpolation (LI); Regional climate model (RCM); Hydrology; climate change; climate modeling; downscaling; hydrological regime; resolution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1542381343

At least 600 million of the earth's more than 6 billion humans dwell in mountainous regions. Such regions feed water into all the major rivers of the world whose valleys support most of the rest of us. At least half of the valley dwellers receive part or all of their water from montane sources, many from the melt water of glaciers, others from the annual snow melt. Glaciers are retreating globally as the earth warms as a result of human-caused changes in the composition of the atmosphere. Many are disappearing, a change that threatens municipal water supplies virtually globally. The warming is greatest in the higher latitudes where the largest glaciers such as those of Greenland and the Antarctic Continent have become vulnerable. The melting of ice in the northern hemisphere raises serious concerns about the continued flow of the Gulf Stream and the possibility of massive climatic changes in Scandinavia and northern Europe. Mountains are also biotic islands in the sea life, rich in endemism at the ecotype level. The systematic warming of the earth changes the environment out from under these genetically specialized strains (ecotypes) which are then maladapted and vulnerable to diseases of all types. The process is systematic impoverishment in the pattern conspicuous on mountain slopes with increasing exposure to climatic extremes. It is seen now in the increased mortality and morbidity of plants as climatic changes accumulate.

The overall mean of SOC to 40cm was 17.2tCha-1 (SEM=2.7) with 60 percent of that carbon residing in the top 20cm. Woody bio-volume (m 3ha-1) was calculated from canopy coverage and average canopy height, and was significantly correlated with woody biomass (p=0.02), total biomass (p=0.03), SOC (p=0.05) and total system C (p=0.02) and warrants consideration as an indicator of land quality and carbon status in the Sahel. Assuming that degraded grasslands may be restored to woody grasslands over 20 years, then C sequestration rates of 0.77tCha-1yr-1 may be achieved. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The idea is based on the premise that the future change of TC track characteristics is primarily determined by changes in large-scale environmental steering flows and in formation locations. It is demonstrated that the main characteristics of the current climatology of TC tracks can be derived from the climatological mean velocity field of TC motion by using a trajectory model. The climatological mean velocity of TC motion, composed of the large-scale steering and beta drift, is determined on each grid of the basin. The mean large-scale steering flow is computed from the NCEP-NCAR reanalysis for the current climate state. The mean beta drift is estimated from the best-track data by removing the steering flow. The derived mean beta drift agrees well with the results of previous observational and numerical studies in terms of its direction and magnitude. The approach is applied to assessing the potential impacts of global warming on TC tracks in the WNP. The possible changes in the large-scale steering flows are taken from the output wind fields of two Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) global warming experiments and possible changes in the TC formation locations are considered by shifting the formation locations as a whole. The GFDL experiments suggested that the changes in the future large-scale steering flows are dominated by the easterly anomalies in the Tropics and westerly anomalies in the midlatitudes with the enhanced northward component during the period of 2030-59. Based on the assessments using two different ways to reduce climate model biases, the prevailing TC tracks shift slightly southwestward during the period of 2000-29, but northeastward during the period of 2030-59. More TCs will take a recurving track and move northeastward during the period of 2030-59. The El Niño-like climate change predicted in many climate models can significantly enhance the track changes if the TC formation locations in the WNP shift eastward as a whole. © 2004 American Meteorological Society.",,"Catchments; Environmental impact; Global warming; Mathematical models; Storms; Beta drift; Steering flow; Tropical cyclone tracks; Climatology; climate change; cyclone; global warming; numerical model; storm track; trajectory; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (North)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342565806

Engineering action makes rapidly permafrost the large extent change. On the basis of analyzing the permafrost change under the climate change and engineering action, the thermal regime and spatial distribution of permafrost are predicted for air temperature rising 1°C and 2°C after 50 years in this paper. The results show that climate change results in the larger change for the thermal regime and spatial distribution of permafrost. Permafrost change will produce the great effect on the Qinghai-Tibet Railroad engineering, not only resulting in the decreasing of permafrost table beneath the roadbed, but also resulting in thawing settlement due to the thawing of ground ice near permafrost table. The idea of cooling roadbed and active protecting permafrost for the Qinghai-Tibet Railroad engineering could adjust and control the permafrost thermal state, some better methods are provided to ensure the engineering stability in the areas of warm permafrost and high ice content.

Recently, the State Key Laboratory of Atmospheric Sciences and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics, Institute of Atmospheric Physics (LASG/IAP) has developed a new version of a GCM (R42L9). In this work, roles of cloud parameterization in the R42L9 are evaluated through a comparison between two 20-year simulations using different cloud schemes. One scheme is that the cloud in the model is diagnosed from relative humidity and vertical velocity, and the other one is that diagnostic cloud is replaced by retrieved cloud amount from the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP), combined with the amounts of high-, middle-, and low-cloud and heights of the cloud base and top from the NCEP. The boreal winter and summer seasonal means, as well as the annual mean, of the simulated top-of-atmosphere shortwave radiative flux, surface energy fluxes, and precipitation are analyzed in comparison with the observational estimates and NCEP reanalysis data. The results show that the scheme of diagnostic cloud parameterization greatly contributes to model biases of radiative budget and precipitation. When our derived cloud fractions are used to replace the diagnostic cloud amount, the top-of-atmosphere and surface radiation fields are better estimated as well as the spatial pattern of precipitation. The simulations of the regional precipitation, especially over the equatorial Indian Ocean in winter and the Asia-western Pacific region in summer, are obviously improved.","Climatological cloud scheme; Cloud parameterization; Diagnostic cloud scheme; Effect of cloud on model performance; R42L9 model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-16544386242

Over this century, these existing stresses will likely be exacerbated by climate changes resulting from human activities. It is essential that policy decisions aimed at preserving the well-being of a region be informed by a good understanding of the region's climate, how climate might change, and the uncertainties inherent in future projections. Recent updates in climate modeling expertise and an expanded view of possible non-intervention emission scenarios have narrowed the range of change that can be expected over the Midwest throughout the next century in some ways, while broadening it in others. In contrast to previous studies, which generally consider a mid-range scenario for future emissions, this study presents the range of change that would result from low to high scenarios for climate change. In this way we account for uncertainties in anthropogenic forcing on climate change in the region and quantify the potential effects of human actions on future climate. This analysis also combines the latest climate model projections with historical records of observed climate over the past century, effectively placing potential changes in extreme event frequencies such as heavy rainfall events and temperature threshold exceedances within the context of observed variability over the past century. The purpose of this study is to provide an updated picture of the potential impacts of climate change on the Midwest to inform the impact assessment and policy development community. From the magnitude of the changes projected by this study, it is clear that these must be included in future policy decisions in order to ensure the successful adaptation and survival of existing human and natural systems in the Midwest.","Midwest; regional climate change; regional impacts assessment","anthropogenic effect; climate change; climate forcing; climate modeling; environmental policy; regional climate; severe weather; Midwest; North America; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4444365359

Due to unfit soil and water conservationin some regions of China, conventional water treatment has showed some defects for the poor quality of water resource. In addition, advances in membrane technology and increasing requirements on water quality have stimulated ultrafiltration (UF) for water treatment. In this research, OF test apparatus was set up to produce drinking water from raw water of the Binxian Reservoir (China). The performance of OF membranes was investigated. There was a linear relationship between membrane resistance and accumulated permeate water. Using coagulation before OF increased permeate flux and retarded membrane flux decline. Surprisingly, membrane permeate flux in a coagulation/UF process was higher than that in coagulation-sand filtration-UF process with raw water of medium turbidity. OF treatment provided effective turbidity removal. Iron, manganese and aluminum were removed completely. The OF membrane also perfectly removed all coliform bacteria. The reduction of total organic carbon was satisfactory. The treated water quality complied with China's drinking water guidelines.

However, the fitting relies on the employed spontaneous radiative transition probabilities and the excitation rate coefficients, which are dependent on the vibrational and rotational quanta in each electronic state. From our study, it is found that, in low temperature plasmas both the Fulcher-α radiative transition and the electron impact excitation to the d 3Πu state from the ground electronic state deviate significantly from the Franck-Condon approximation. The vibrationally resolved complete sets of the cross sections are calculated based on the semi-classical Gryzinski theory, and the Fulcher band transition probabilities are obtained based on the newest published data on the electronic transition moment and the solution to the radial Schrödinger equation. The fitting to experimental line emissions shows that Boltzmann's Law can be employed for the distribution of vibrational (in lower level), and particularly for the rotational, populations in the ground electronic state of H2 in low temperature plasmas.",,"Approximation theory; Ground state; Hydrogen; Ion bombardment; Ionization; Low temperature effects; Mathematical models; Perturbation techniques; Probability; Electron impact excitation; Electronic states; Excitation rate coefficients; Radiative transitions; Plasmas",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2342537771

The pollen record spanning the last ca 10,000 yr revealed a detailed history of vegetation and climate changes over the Daihai Lake region during the Holocene. From ca 10,250 to 7900 cal yr BP, arid herbs and shrubs dominated the lake basin in company with patches of mixed pine and broadleaved forests, indicating a mild and dry climatic condition. Over this period, the woody plants displayed an increasing trend, which may suggest a gradual increase in warmth and humidity. The period between ca 7900 and 4450 cal yr BP exhibits large-scale covers of mixed coniferous and broadleaved forests, marking a warm and humid climate. Changes in the composition of the forests indicate that both temperature and precipitation displayed obvious fluctuations during this period, i.e., cool and humid ca 7900-7250 cal yr BP, warm and slightly humid ca 7250-6050 cal yr BP, warm and humid between ca 6050 and 5100 cal yr BP, mild and slightly humid ca 5100-4800 cal yr BP, and mild and humid ca 4800-4450 cal yr BP. The period can be viewed as the Holocene optimum (characterized by a warm and moist climate) of north-central China, with the maximum (dominated both by warmest temperatures and by richest precipitations) occurring from ca 6050 to 5100 cal yr BP. During the period of ca 4450-2900 cal yr BP, the woody plants declined, and the climate generally became cooler and drier than the preceding period. This period is characterized by a cold, dry episode from ca 4450 to 3950 cal yr BP, a warm, slightly humid interval between ca 3950 and 3500 cal yr BP and a mild, slightly dry episode from ca 3500 to 2900 cal yr BP, and appears to be a transition from warm and humid to cold and dry climatic conditions. Since ca 2900 cal yr ago, the forests disappeared and the vegetation density decreased, reflecting a cool and dry climate. However, a relative recovery of the woody plants occurring between ca 1700 and 1350 cal yr BP may denote an increase both in temperature and in precipitation.

We apply a global chemical transport model simulation of the CH4-C2H6-CO system for the TRACE-P period to interpret these observations in terms of CH4 sources and to explore in particular the unique constraints from the CH 4-C2H6-CO correlations. We use as a priori a global CH4 source inventory constrained with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Climate Monitoring and Diagnostics Laboratory (CMDL) surface observations [Wang et al., 2004]. We find that the observed CH4 concentration enhancements and CH4-C2H6-CO correlations in Asian outflow in TRACE-P are deterinined mainly by anthropogenic emissions from China and Eurasia (defined here as Europe and eastern Russia), with only little contribution from tropical sources (wetlands and biomass burning). The a priori inventory overestimates the observed CH4 enhancements and shows regionally variable biases for the CH4/C2H6 slope. The CH 4/CO slopes are simulated without significant bias. Matching both the observed CH4 enhancements and the CH 4-C2H6-CO slopes in Asian outflow requires increasing the east Asian anthropogenic source of CH 4, and decreasing the Eurasian anthropogenic source, by at least 30% for both. The need to increase the east Asian source is driven by the underestimate of the CH4/C2H 6 slope in boundary layer Chinese outflow. The Streets et al. [2003] anthropogenic emission inventory for east Asia fits this constraint by increasing CH4 emissions from that region by 40% relative to the a priori, largely because of higher livestock and landfill source estimates. Eurasian sources (mostly European) then need to be reduced by 30-50% from the a priori value of 68 Tg yr -1. The decrease of European sources could result in part from recent mitigation of emissions from coal mining and landfills.

Anesthetized female rats were prepared with closed cranial windows. Pial arteriolar diameters were measured using intravital microscopy. L-αAAA (2 mM) was injected into the space under the cranial windows 24 h before the study, and injury to the GL was confirmed by light microscopy. L-αAAA was associated with a reduction in pial arteriolar CO2 reactivity to 40-50% of the level seen in vehicle-treated controls, with no further reduction in the CO2 response after nitric oxide (NO) synthase (NOS) inhibition via Nω-nitro-L-arginine (L-NNA). Subsequent blockade of prostanoid synthesis, via indomethacin (Indo), reduced CO2 reactivity to 10-15% of normal. In vehicle-treated controls, L-NNA, followed by Indo, reduced the response to ∼50% and then to 15-20% of the normocapnic value, respectively. On the other hand, L-αAAA had no effect on vascular responses to the endothelium-dependent vasodilator acetylcholine or the NO donor SNAP and did not alter cortical somatosensory evoked responses. This indicates an absence of any direct L-αAAA actions on pial arterioles or influence on neuronal transmission. Furthermore, L-αAAA did not alter the vasodilation elicited by topical application of an acidic artificial cerebrospinal fluid solution, suggesting that the GL influences the pial arteriolar relaxation elicited by hypercapnic, but not local extracellular (EC), acidosis. That differences exist in the mechanisms mediating hypercapnia-versus EC acidosis-induced pial arteriolar dilations was further exemplified by the finding that topical application of a neuronal NOS (nNOS)-selective blocker (ARR-17477) reduced the response to hypercapnia (by ∼65%) but not the response to EC acidosis. Disruption of GL gap junctional communication, using an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) connexin43 knockdown approach, was accompanied by a 33% lower CO2 reactivity versus missense ODN-treated controls. These results suggest that the GL contribution to the hypercapnic vascular response appears to involve the NO-dependent component rather than the prostanoid-dependent component and may involve gap junctional communication. We speculate that the GL may act to facilitate the spread, to pial vessels, of hypercapnia-induced vasodilating signals arising in the comparatively few scattered nNOS neurons that lie well beneath the GL.","Connexin; Gap junction; Hypercapnia; L-α-aminoadipic acid; Nitric oxide; Prostanoids","2 aminoadipic acid; acetylcholine; antisense oligodeoxynucleotide; arr 17477; carbon dioxide; connexin 43; gap junction protein; gliotoxin; indometacin; n acetyl s nitrosopenicillamine; n(g) nitroarginine; nitric oxide; nitric oxide donor; nitric oxide synthase; nitric oxide synthase inhibitor; prostanoid; unclassified drug; vasodilator agent; acidosis; arteriole; artery diameter; artery dilatation; article; blood vessel reactivity; cerebrospinal fluid; controlled study; enzyme inhibition; evoked somatosensory response; extracellular acidosis; extracellular space; female; gap junction; glia; glia limiting membrane; hypercapnia; microscopy; neurotransmission; nonhuman; pia arteriole; pia artery; priority journal; rat; 2-Aminoadipic Acid; Animals; Arterioles; Astrocytes; Carbon Dioxide; Cerebral Cortex; Connexin 43; Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory; Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; Female; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Hypercapnia; Nitric Oxide Donors; Oligonucleotides, Antisense; Pia Mater; Rats; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; S-Nitroso-N-Acetylpenicillamine; Vasodilation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042579701

Sci., Plcy. and Mgmt., University of California at Berkeley, Berkeley, CA 94720, United States","Understanding how environmental variables affect the processes that regulate the carbon flux over grassland is critical for large-scale modeling research, since grasslands comprise almost one-third of the earth's natural vegetation. To address this issue, fluxes of CO2 (Fc, flux toward the surface is negative) were measured over a Mediterranean, annual grassland in California, USA for 2 years with the eddy covariance method. To interpret the biotic and abiotic factors that modulate Fc over the course of a year we decomposed net ecosystem CO2 exchange into its constituent components, ecosystem respiration (Reco) and gross primary production (GPP). Daytime Reco was extrapolated from the relationship between temperature and nighttime Fc under high turbulent conditions. Then, GPP was estimated by subtracting daytime values of Fc from daytime estimates of Reco. Results show that most of carbon exchange, both photosynthesis and respiration, was limited to the wet season (typically from October to mid-May). Seasonal variations in GPP followed closely to changes in leaf area index, which in turn was governed by soil moisture, available sunlight and the timing of the last frost. In general, Reco was an exponential function of soil temperature, but with season-dependent values of Q10. The temperature-dependent respiration model failed immediately after rain events, when large pulses of R eco were observed. Respiration pulses were especially notable during the dry season when the grass was dead and were the consequence of quickly stimulated microbial activity. Integrated values of GPP, Reco, and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) were 867, 735, and -132gCm-2, respectively, for the 2000-2001 season, and 729, 758, and 29gCm-2 for the 2001-2002 season. Thus, the grassland was a moderate carbon sink during the first season and a weak carbon source during the second season. In contrast to a well-accepted view that annual production of grass is linearly correlated to precipitation, the large difference in GPP between the two seasons were not caused by the annual precipitation. Instead, a shorter growing season, due to late start of the rainy season, was mainly responsible for the lower GPP in the second season. Furthermore, relatively higher Reco during the non-growing season occurred after a late spring rain. Thus, for this Mediterranean grassland, the timing of rain events had more impact than the total amount of precipitation on ecosystem GPP and NEE. This is because its growing season is in the cool and wet season when carbon uptake and respiration are usually limited by low temperature and sometimes frost, not by soil moisture. © 2003 Elsevier B.V.

The potentials of soil CH4 uptake at two initial CH 4 concentrations were studied under aerobic conditions in the laboratory, along with inhibition of soil CH4 oxidation by urea-N or KNO3-N addition. Due to long-term N inputs, the CH4 uptake of the upper mineral layer of the orchard soil was 25.4% and 87.7% lower than that of the surface forest soil at 2.4 and 12.6 μl l-1 CH 4, respectively. Methane uptake of the forest soil decreased with increasing soil depths at two CH4 levels. However, maximal CH 4-consuming activity occurred in the 9- to 23-cm depth of the orchard soil at 12.6 μl l-1 methane. Nitrogen additions in the form of KNO3 or urea at the rate of 200 μg N g-1 soil substantially reduced soil CH4 uptake in the upper and sub-surface mineral layers at both sites, except that the addition of KNO3-N had no apparent inhibitory effect on the CH4 uptake in the 9- to 23-cm depth of the orchard soil. A strong inhibitory effect of NO3 - addition on the CH4 uptake, in contrast to NH 4+, occurred in the surface forest soil. The use of KNO3-N, as compared to urea or urea plus a nitrification inhibitor (dicyandiamide), resulted in a lower potential to cause inhibition of CH 4 oxidation in the 0- to 23-cm depth of the orchard soil. © Springer-Verlag 2004.","Forest soil; Land use; Methane; Nitrification inhibitor; Nitrogen fertilizers","coniferous forest; fertilizer application; forest soil; methane; nitrification; orchard",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4644317541

Thus the adsorption of CO from the residual gas in UHV might induce a slight change in the spectral shape within a measurement period (∼103 s).

With the regulation of Pb emissions, loadings have decreased. We measured changes in Pb in forest floor horizons at a variety of northern hardwood sites in New Hampshire from the late 1970s to the 1990s. In all seven of the sites in which horizons were distinguished within the forest floor, Pb was found to be declining in the upper (Oie) horizon, but not in the underlying Oa and A horizons. At the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), this loss from the Oie resulted in a 36% loss of Pb from the forest floor as a whole between 1976 and 1997 (p < 0.001). In contrast, in six stands in the Bartlett Experimental Forest (BEF), losses of Pb averaging <50% from the Oi and Oe horizons (p = 0.01) between 1979 and 1994 were compensated by gains in the Oa and A horizons. Similarly, at seven additional stands in the White Mountain National Forest, changes in the forest floor as a whole from 1980 to 1995 were not statistically significant (redistribution within the forest floor was not evaluated at these sites).

Sim1 haploinsufficiency causes hyperphagia in mice and humans, most likely by perturbing the hypothalamus function. The administration of 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), a ligand of AHR, causes severe anorexia, which also appears to be of central origin. Both SIM1 and AHR require heterodimerization either with ARNT or ARNT2 to function. Here, we characterize the promoter for Sim1 and show that a consensus AHR-ARNT/2 binding site positively regulates its activity in the context of transfection experiments in Neuro-2A cells. A gel shift assay indicated that AHR-ARNT/2 can bind its putative site in the Sim1 promoter. Overexpression of Arnt, Arnt2, or Ahr increased the activity of a reporter construct containing the Sim1 promoter by 1.8-, 1.5-, and 2.2-fold, respectively, but failed to do so when the AHR-ARNT/2 binding site was mutated. Similarly, TCDD increased the activity of the reporter construct by 1.8-fold but not that of its mutated version.

But there is still a lack of detailed and systematically theoretical study on the packed bed burning of biomass and municipal solid wastes. The advantage of theoretical study lies in its ability to reveal features of the detailed structure of the burning process inside a solid bed, such as reaction zone thickness, combustion staging, rates of individual sub-processes, gas emission and char burning characteristics. These characteristics are hard to measure by conventional experimental techniques. In this paper, mathematical simulations as well as experiments have been carried out for the combustion of wood chips and the incineration of simulated municipal solid wastes in a bench-top stationary bed and the effects of primary air flow rate and moisture level in the fuel have been assessed over wide ranges. It is found that volatile release as well as char burning intensifies with an increase in the primary air flow until a critical point is reached where a further increase in the primary air results in slowing down of the combustion process; a higher primary airflow also reduces the char fraction burned in the final char-burning-only stage, shifts combustion in the bed to a more fuel-lean environment and reduces CO emission at the bed top; an increase in the moisture level in the fuel produces a higher flame front temperature in the bed at low primary air flow rates. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In the absence of other data, one could assume that a mitigation strategy aimed at reducing the nation's GHG emissions would work equally well for Pennsylvania. Easterling et al. suggest that such an assumption would mean that the mitigation plan might not be effective in other states with radically different profiles of GHG sources, such as Kansas. The results also show that-because of its dependence on coal as an energy source-central Pennsylvania varies considerably from national emissions patterns and even from Pennsylvania as a whole. If a national emissions reduction strategy targeted coal, then this area would suffer disproportionately as it restructured its economy to meet national mandates. The implications of these results are that a United States GHG mitigation strategy must take into account regional and local differences in emissions. A ""one size fits all"" plan to reduce GHG emissions would produce gross inequities, with some places shouldering more than their fair share of the burden and others making few sacrifices in the drive to stem climate change. Mitigation plans that do not account for spatial unevenness in emissions not only will be unfair, but also will be much less effective than schemes that help each area address the problem in ways that put this global problem into regional and local context.",,"coal-fired power plant; emission control; emission inventory; equity; greenhouse gas; North America; Pennsylvania; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942696442

A visibility model based on Mie theory is modified to use the calculated source contributions to airborne particulate matter size and composition as well as gas-phase pollutant concentrations to quantify total source contributions to visibility impairment. The combined air quality-visibility model is applied to predict source contributions to visibility reduction in southern California for a typical air pollution episode (September 23-25, 1996). The model successfully predicts a severe visibility reduction in the eastern portion of the South Coast Air Basin where the average daytime visibility is measured to be less than 10 km. In the relatively clean coastal portion of the domain, the model successfully predicts that the average daytime visibility is greater than 65 km. Transportation-related sources directly account for approximately 50% of the visibility reduction (diesel engines ∼15-20%, catalyst-equipped gasoline engines ∼10-20%, noncatalyst-equipped gasoline engines ∼3-5%, crustal and paved road dust ∼5%) in the region with the most severe visibility impairment.

Using an arylsulfatase gene driven by the Cah1 promoter, a regulatory mutant of Cah1 was isolated and named lcr1 (for low-CO2 stress response). The photosynthetic affinity for inorganic carbon of lcr1 was reduced compared with that of wild-type cells. Expression of three low-CO2-inducible genes, Cah1, Lci1, and Lci6, were regulated by LCR1 as shown by cDNA array and RNA gel blot analyses. The Lcr1 gene encodes a protein of 602 amino acids containing a single Myb domain, which binds to the Cah1-promoter region. Expression of Lcr1 was induced by lowering CO2 levels and controlled by the regulatory factor CCM1.

In the course of our study, the amount of sea level rise was estimated using the tidal data from 9 stations selected by an anomaly coherency analysis. The results indicated that the sea level has risen by 0.28 cm yr-1 around the Korean Peninsula over the past two decades. The extent of such a rise is about two times higher than that of the global increase (0.1-0.2 cm yr-1). However, because most global warming effects occurred mainly over mid- and high-latitudes, this level of change appears to be realistic. According to the spectral analysis (at a spectral window of k = 2, k is the number of subdivisions), the decadal band of sea level variability is computed at 30% of the energy. Its spectral peak is found at 12.8 years. In the interannual band, the predominant sea level variability is in the 1.4-1.9-year band, with a sharp peak at 1.6 years. A secondary peak, although marginal, has a period of 2.2 years. Based on our estimates of sea level height from Topex/Poseidon, the quasi-biennial periodicity of 1.6 years is the representative interannual sea level variability in the seas adjacent to Korea. Trends vary greatly according to the geographical location, from a maximum of 1.0 cm yr-1 (the southern sector of the East Sea) to a minimum of 0.17 cm yr-1 (the northern sector of the East Sea). This is fairly consistent with the qualitative description already given with reference to the global map. As an analogue to the pattern seen in Korea, that of the Yellow Sea reveals practically the same trend as that of the adjacent seas (0.56 cm yr-1). However, in the case of TOPEX/POSEIDON (T/P) data, there is no clear evidence of a linkage between the interannual sea level variability around the Korean Peninsula and ENSO.","Altimetry; ENSO; Sea level; Tidal station; TOPEX/POSEIDON",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4143152689

Although plant wax alkanes contribute to ambient concentrations of fine particles, the presence of petroleum biomarkers suggests n-alkanes mainly come from anthropogenic sources, and specific species concentrations are used to separate sites by the degree to which motor vehicle and petroleum combustion emissions impact local air quality.

Three ignition systems were tested including spark ignition (SI), diesel pilot ignition (DPI) and hydrogen assisted jet ignition (HAJI). Irrespective of ignition system used, the efficiency of the engine operating on CNG was significantly reduced at part load compared to diesel. This was predominantly due to a greater amount of unburnt hydrocarbons, higher cycle-by-cycle variability, slow and partial burns and increased heat transfer to the walls. DPI and HAJI systems were able to extend the lean limit to lambda 2.7 and 3.3 respectively, however this did not result in efficiency gains. HAJI proved to be superior to DPI with higher peak efficiency, lower carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and particulates, and significantly lower oxides of nitrogen in the absence of a locally rich ignition source. Control of the air/fuel ratio through the combined use of HAJI and supercharging demonstrated that oxides of nitrogen can be controlled, even at higher loads, with little or no loss in efficiency. At 600kPa BMEP, NOx emissions were reduced to one-fortieth of their original value whilst maintaining an indicated efficiency of 40%. © 2004 SAE International.",,"Boron compounds; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Compressed natural gas; Compression ratio (machinery); Diesel engines; Efficiency; Engine cylinders; Fighter aircraft; Gas emissions; Heat transfer; Nitrogen; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); High compression ratio; Indicated efficiency; Oxides of nitrogen; Particulate Matter; Pollutant emission; Single cylinders; Un-burnt hydrocarbons; Ignition systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877225328

Samples of the six main soil types of the basin were taken from paddy fields with different fertilities. The total numbers of bacteria and denitrifying bacteria in the high fertility soils were much more than those in low fertility soils, and the number of denitrifying bacteria accounted for 49% to 80% of the total number of bacteria. The O2 content was an important ecological factor that affected denitrification. Of test the strains isolated from the paddy soils in the Taihu Lake Basin, some (e.g., Pseudomonas spp.) grew well under low oxygen partial pressure, while others (e.g., Bacillus spp.) had no strict predilection with O2 content. Another critical ecological factor was the nitrogen concentration. Three selected denitrifying bacteria grew better in a culture medium with 135 instead of 276 mg L-1 nitrogen.

The arc then burns in a mixture of the working gas (SF6 in the case of circuit breakers) and electrode vapor, whose properties are substantially different from those of pure SF6. The present work is a computational investigation into the effects of electrode vapor on the behavior of a supersonic nozzle arc under dc conditions. The arc and electrodes are treated as a coupled system. The arc plasma is assumed to be in local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE). The thin non-LTE layer between the electrode and the arc is not included in the computation but its effects are taken into account in the energy balance at the electrode surface. A conservation equation for the electrode vapor is solved together with the governing equations for mass, momentum, and energy of the gas mixture. Comparisons were made between the results with and without electrode vaporization. Results show that vaporization of the electrode material (copper in the present investigation) has a cooling effect at the arc center and broadens the arc column. The arc voltage is, however, not sensitive to the presence of electrode vapor for the gas discharge conditions investigated. © 2004 IEEE.",,"Circuit breaking arcs; Computational fluid dynamics; Copper; Electrodes; Evaporation; Mathematical models; Nozzles; Plasma torches; Supersonic flow; Thermodynamic properties; Arc behavior; Arc devices; Arc plasma; Computational investigation; Electrode vaporization; Plasma devices",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-4344643875

Compared to the typical radio frequency deposition technique, the very high plasma excitation frequency increases the density of the electrons and decreases the electron temperature, which helps the dissociation of the SiH4 and CH4, and reduces the energetic ion impact on the growth surface of the thin film. Thus, dense-films with lower bulk density of states and higher growth rate are expected, as confirmed by spectroscopic ellipsometry data. Apart from that, a substantial reduction of bulk defects is achieved, allowing an improvement of the valence controllability (widening of the optical gap from about 1.9 to 3.6 eV).

A continuous steady-state model was used to estimate residence times of various phosphorus pools and uptake rates of the biological food chain within the upper ocean of the East China Sea. 32P/33P ratios increased from the dissolved pools to the suspended matter and to net-plankton, reflecting that the age of P increased as one moved up through the food chain. The residence times of P in the dissolved pools of coastal water and mid-shelf area were very short (3-4 days), which suggests that low phosphorus concentrations could support relatively high levels of primary production. A phytoplankton assimilating flux of 189-814mgCm-2day-1 and a zooplankton grazing flux of 10-161mgCm-2day-1 were also estimated and show that grazing rates of carbon corresponded to 3-20% of primary production. In addition, the particulate organic carbon fluxes from the upper ocean were calculated by directly comparing the measured seawater inventory of 32P and 33P to that measured in rain, and were found to range between 8.5 and 81.0mmolm-2day-1. These results show that the naturally produced 32P and 33P can provide much needed information regarding the biogeochemical cycling of P in marine systems and can be of use in the development of ecosystem models that seek to address mechanisms that affect primary production in the ocean. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

Carbon dioxide leakage plumes are similar in many ways to volatile organic compound (VOC) vapor plumes, and the same remediation approaches are applicable. We present here numerical simulation results of passive and active remediation strategies for CO2 leakage plumes in the vadose zone. The starting time for the remediation scenarios is assumed to be after a steady-state CO2 leakage plume is established in the vadose zone, and the source of this plume has been cut off. We consider first passive remediation, both with and without barometric pumping. Next, we consider active methods involving extraction wells in both vertical and horizontal configurations. To compare the effectiveness of the various remediation strategies, we define a half-life of the CO2 plume as a convenient measure of the CO2 removal rate. For CO2 removal by passive remediation approaches such as barometric pumping, thicker vadose zones generally require longer remediation times. However, for the case of a thin vadose zone where a significant fraction of the CO2 plume mass resides within the high liquid saturation region near the water table, the half-life of the CO2 plume without barometric pumping is longer than for somewhat thicker vadose zones. As for active strategies, results show that a combination of horizontal and vertical wells is the most effective among the strategies investigated, as the performance of commonly used multiple vertical wells was not investigated. © Soil Science Society of America.",,"Groundwater; Horizontal wells; Pollution; Pumps; Volatile organic compounds; Barometric pumping; Carbon dioxide leakage; Carbon dioxide sequestration; Extraction wells; Liquid saturation; Remediation measures; Remediation strategies; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-27644441391

Sorption isotherms of the test compounds on Tenax-TA are nonlinear, and most show an inflection at high concentration, marking a change in physical state from glassy to rubbery. A simple dual-mode model was applied to the isotherms below the apparent inflection point. Sorption parameters for dissolution and hole-filling domains each correlate with the octanol-water partition coefficient. The effects of dissolved organic matter and salinity on Tenax-TA uptake are minor. Regeneration of Tenax-TA by hot-methanol extraction increased its affinity for naphthalene. Inclusion of 23% graphitized carbon in the polymer reduced affinity for phenanthrene. Uptake rate data were fit by the dual-mode diffusion model, which assumes diffusion in the polymer matrix. The obtained diffusion rate parameter correlates with molecular size. Equilibrium and kinetic parameters for benzene and nitrobenzene were comparable despite a three-orders-of-magnitude difference in their Henry's law coefficients, indicating that a pathway to the Tenax surface through the vapor phase is not required. Extrapolating to typical conditions in soil-desorption studies reveals that single-solute uptake is 95% or more complete within 4 min for the test compounds and within 7 min for benzo[a]pyrene. Thus, Tenax is suitable for compounds with desorption from soil or sediment that occurs over comparably longer timescales.","Bioavailability; Dual-mode sorption; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon","Correlation methods; Diffusion; Extraction; Extrapolation; Impurities; Isotherms; Mathematical models; Sediments; Soils; Bioavaialability; Kinetic parameters; Organic contaminants; Aromatic compounds; adsorbent; aromatic compound; benzene; benzo[a]pyrene; carbon; dissolved organic matter; graphite; methanol extraction residue; naphthalene; nitrobenzene; organic compound; phenanthrene; polymer; pyrene; resin; water; adsorption; bioavailability; desorption; organic pollutant; polymer; aqueous solution; article; bioavailability; chemical analysis; desorption; diffusion; equilibrium constant; infinite sink; kinetics; molecular size; partition coefficient; physical chemistry; practice guideline; priority journal; salinity; sediment; soil degradation; soil pollution; solute; source sink relationship; surface property; water management; water pollution; Adsorption; Geologic Sediments; Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Kinetics; Models, Chemical; Naphthalenes; Phenanthrenes; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Polymers; Pyrenes; Soil Pollutants; Solvents; Thermodynamics; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2942514537

Uncertainty refers to lack of knowledge regarding the true value of a quantity. Mixture distributions have the potential to improve the goodness of fit to data sets not adequately described by a single parametric distribution. Uncertainty due to random sampling error in statistics of interests can be estimated based upon bootstrap simulation. In order to evaluate the robustness of using mixture distribution as a basis for estimating both variability and uncertainty, 108 synthetic data sets generated from selected population mixture log-normal distributions were investigated, and properties of variability and uncertainty estimates were evaluated with respect to variation in sample size, mixing weight, and separation between components of mixtures. Furthermore, mixture distributions were compared with single-component distributions. Findings include: (1) mixing weight influences the stability of variability and uncertainty estimates; (2) bootstrap simulation results tend to be more stable for larger sample sizes; (3) when two components are well separated; the stability of bootstrap simulation is improved; however, a larger degree of uncertainty arises regarding the percentiles coinciding with the separated region; (4) when two components are not well separated, a single distribution may often be a better choice because it has fewer parameters and better numerical stability; and (5) dependencies exist in sampling distributions of parameters of mixtures and are influenced by the amount of separation between the components. An emission factor case study based upon NOx emissions from coal-fired tangential boilers is used to illustrate the application of the approach.","Bootstrap simulation; Mixture distributions; Parameter estimation; Uncertainty; Variability","Computer simulation; Convergence of numerical methods; Error analysis; Statistical methods; Sampling errors; Variability; Risk management; nitric oxide; bootstrapping; sampling; uncertainty analysis; boiler; parametric test; quantitative analysis; randomization; review; sample size; statistical analysis",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-3042716474

The structures of the main intermediary and transition states are optimized completely at the B3LYP/6-31g(d) level. The harmonic frequencies of all the structures are calculated, and corresponding vibrational modes are decided. The reduction path discussed in this paper mainly goes through the formation of the catalyst-borane adduct 2, catalyst-borane-keto oxime ether adduct 3b, adduct 4b with a B(2)-N(3)-BBH2-NC=N four-membered ring, 5b′ with a B(2)-N(3)-BBH2-NC=N-CC=N-C C=O-OC=O seven-membered ring and adduct 5b. Studies on transition states indicate that the controlling steps for the chirality of products are the transfers of hydride from the borane moiety to the oxime carbon and carbonyl carbon.

When the formula DTOC=(TOC0-TOC)/TOC0 (original organic carbon content in the rock) is used to measure the TOC (total organic carbon content) changes in the source rock through geological time, the degrees and directions of such changes are determined by losses and relative amounts both of organic and inorganic matter in the source rock. The DTOC equation, which is used to calculate the loss rate in the process of maturation for the source rock, is therefore obtained by analyzing the mass balance relations. For a certain type of source rock with a certain maturation history, the changes of its TOC respond only to the rates of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion. In actual cases of geological entities, DTOC generally ranges from -0.05 to 0.2, while the calculated reconversion coefficient (k) for organic carbon content remains between 0.90 and 1.25. Only in an ideal situation where there are extremely high rates of hydrocarbon generation and expulsion can the DTOC value experience significant changes, with k reaching up to 2.5. It is concluded, therefore, that the criterion for carbonates source rock assessment, based on reconverting the TOC to the value of its original state, may have overestimated the course of the ""carbon-reduction"", which is likely in many cases to make a poor source rock sound better.

Regional climate changes have been invoked as a major factor; however, assessing the impact of climate in malaria resurgence is difficult due to high spatial and temporal climate variability and the lack of long-term data series on malaria cases from different sites. Climate variability, defined as short-term fluctuations around the mean climate state, may be epidemiologically more relevant than mean temperature change, but its effects on malaria epidemics have not been rigorously examined. Here we used nonlinear mixed-regression model to investigate the association between autoregression (number of malaria outpatients during the previous time period), seasonality and climate variability, and the number of monthly malaria outpatients of the past 10-20 years in seven highland sites in East Africa. The model explained 65-81% of the variance in the number of monthly malaria outpatients. Nonlinear and synergistic effects of temperature and rainfall on the number of malaria outpatients were found in all seven sites. The net variance in the number of monthly malaria outpatients caused by autoregression and seasonality varied among sites and ranged from 18 to 63% (mean = 38.6%), whereas 12-63% (mean = 36.1%) of variance is attributed to climate variability. Our results suggest that there was a high spatial variation in the sensitivity of malaria outpatient number to climate fluctuations in the highlands, and that climate variability played an important role in initiating malaria epidemics in the East African highlands.","Climate change; Plasmodium falciparum; Statistical modeling; Time series analysis","Africa; article; autoregression; climate change; epidemic; epidemiological data; geographic distribution; geographic elevation; human; long term care; major clinical study; malaria; nonhuman; nonlinear system; outpatient; Plasmodium falciparum; priority journal; regression analysis; risk factor; sensitivity analysis; spatial autocorrelation analysis; statistical analysis; temperature measurement; Africa, Eastern; Climate; Disease Outbreaks; Ethiopia; Humans; Incidence; Kenya; Malaria; Seasons; Temperature; Uganda; Plasmodium falciparum; Protozoa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1442354948

Three small hydrocarbon accumulations have so far been located at the margins of a Lower Carboniferous salt body (measuring about 55km × 75km and 115-225m thick, controlled by wells and 2D and 3D seismic sections). In this paper, we consider the development of this salt body and discuss possible reasons why vertical diapirs are absent from the study area. We attempt to develop a model of salt flow and we investigate the relationship between salt flow and the occurrence of oil and gas traps. Using recently-acquired high-resolution 2D and 3D seismic profiles, we show that the Lower Carboniferous salt has undergone three separate phases of plastic flow. At the end of the Early Permian, the salt flowed southwards by 2.0-2.8 km; then, during the Late Triassic - Early Jurassic, it flowed in the same direction by 1.0-1.8 km; and finally at the end of the Tertiary, it flowed northwards by 0.6-1.5 km. These movements resulted in the formation of various types of structural trap in the Kalashayi, Akekule and Halahatan Formations including salt ridge anticlines, domes and marginal troughs. Salt ridge and salt edge low-amplitude anticlines are probably the most important targets for future hydrocarbon exploration.",,"Catchments; Geographical regions; Hydrocarbons; Mathematical models; Salts; Anticline structures; Hydrocarbon extrapolation; Crude petroleum; Carboniferous; deformation; hydrocarbon entrapment; salt; seismic survey; stratigraphy; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Tarim Basin; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-1342287454

The following conclusions were drawn: (1) The microclimatic differences between inside and outside forest are less in the fragmented forests than in the primary forest, which indicates that the buffer effects to climatic change have been reduced in the fragmented forests. The soil has deteriorated to some extent due to forest fragmentation. (2) In species composition, especially the abundance of some species and the dominant ranks of some families have changed with fragmentation. Barringtonia macrostachya, the most dominant species in the control primary forest, disappeared from the fragmented forests, while Antiaris toxicaria, which is a characteristic but not dominant species in the primary forest, is dominant in fragmented forests. (3) The total number of species per plot was reduced in the fragmented forests and the more seriously disturbed the fragment was, the more the species richness diminished. (4) In life form spectra, the liana and microphanerophyte species increased, but epiphyte, megaphanerophyte, mesophanerophyte and chamaephyte species decreased in the fragmented forests. (5) The plant species diversity is generally lower in the fragmented forests than in the primary forest, although for some life forms it could be higher. (6) The tree species with small populations could be lost first in the process of rain forest fragmentation. (7) The heliophilous or pioneer tree species increased and the shade-tolerant species were reduced in the fragmented forests.","Ecological factors; Rainforest fragments; Southern Yunnan of China; Species diversity","community composition; habitat fragmentation; microclimate; rainforest; soil degradation; species diversity; species richness; Asia; China; Eurasia; Far East; Yunnan; Antiaris; Antiaris toxicaria; Barringtonia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2142711260

Charts for London, Milan and Paris were assessed to determine the relationship between urban scale and regional scale ozone response to NOx emission reductions. In all three cities, fine scale models showed significant increases in the population weighted levels of AOT30 with reduction in NOx levels beyond the Base Case in 2010. This was expected given that the reduction in NOx removed the NO that titrated the ozone on the city. Hence, ozone levels were not reduced as much over the city as in the Base Case, so population exposure to ozone rose. This has important implications for any cost-benefit assessment based on human population exposure: although further NOx control (beyond that already legislated) may reduce regional scale ozone, it would increase population exposure in cities, implying negative human health benefits.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-2642523742

Fontaine (Ministry of Industry) in November 2003. The topics include introduction; the place of energy in the economy and society; the demand for energy; the reserves of petroleum and gas; the placement of renewable energies; the advantages of choosing nuclear energy in terms of national independence and the production of energy with weak CO2 emissions; the four priority goals of the energy policy of France; and the energy policy as having to lean on concrete and operational measures. After the first oil shock France developed a policy of energy saving and of developing nuclear energy, creating energy independence and generating competitive electricity. Also, France today is in a better energy position than some other countries in the struggle against climatic change. The challenge today relates to greenhouse gas emissions. The scorching heat of the summer 2003 is but one omen among others. The second challenge is to develop an energy policy that takes into account the development of economic realities, or tensions, that will inevitably occur in the world. In several decades the production of oil and gas will plateau and will be concentrated in the hands of a few states the geopolitical stability of which may be uncertain. Also, the economic growth of demographic giants like China and India will inevitably lead to a growth in consumption, considerable but legitimate, and reconcilable with difficulty with the stagnation of production without having consequences on the price of energy and the inevitable increase in greenhouse gas emissions. To stand up to these challenges, the reduction in the greenhouse gas emissions in France by a factor of four times between now and 2050 and the development of competing energy sources also responding to the growth in world demand as well as the exigencies of security of supply, are thus imperatives to which the energy policy will contribute. Four goals should thus guide the action of France, i.e., the guarantee of the right of access to energy for all citizens; the struggle against global warming; the preservation of an element of national independence to limit the impact of tensions to come in the oil market; and the maintenance of a competitive energy in France.

However, emissions of CO2 in the EU are increasing which creates difficulties with respect to engagements with the Kyoto protocol. The generation of electricity by cogeneration represented 11% of the total generation of electricity of the EU in 1998. If part of the cogeneration in the generation of electricity would increase to 18%, the savings in energy would represent ∼ 3-4% of the basic energy consumption of the EU. Cogeneration economizes energy and improves the security of supply. Cogeneration decreases losses in grid energy because cogeneration power plants are closer to the areas of consumption in general. A cogeneration plant for electricity and heat functions thanks to turbines or gas engines. Natural gas is the most common energy used in cogeneration plants. However, renewable energies and wastes can also be used. In contrast to a traditional electric power plants where the flue gases go directly to the chimney, in cogeneration the flue gases are first cooled, ceding their energy to a hot water/steam circuit. Cogeneration plants can achieve ∼ 90% energy efficiency. The process is more ecological because natural gas liberates less CO2 and NOx than oil or coal. The development of cogeneration could avoid the emissions of 127 million ton of CO2 in the EU in 2010 and 258 million ton in 2020. The EC proposes to promote the installation of cogeneration plants where there is a demand for one or where a demand is expected to develop. In the short term, the directive reinforces existing cogeneration plants and promotes new ones. In the long term the directive creates the framework needed for a highly efficient cogeneration plant to reduce emissions of CO2 and other substances, contributing to sustainable development.
