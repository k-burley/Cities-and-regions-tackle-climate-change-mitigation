Different geographical regions have different priorities, but common drivers are climate change mitigation and the desire for energy independence. Now, industrial biotechnology has reached the centre of scientific and political attention. At no time in the past has there been a more pressing need for coherent, evidence-based, proportionate regulations and policy measures; they are at the heart of responsible development of industrial biotechnology. This publication examines the international drivers, the enabling technologies that are fast-tracking Industrial Biotechnology, industry trends, some of the products that are appearing on the market, industry structure and finance, and finally policy measures and trends. It examines separately biofuels, biobased chemicals and bioplastics. It is quite clear that a supportive policy framework for the development of biofuels exists in many countries, but that no such framework is in place for biobased chemicals and bioplastics. This seems at odds with the apparent need for the integrated biorefinery, where chemicals and plastics production will significantly improve profitability when produced alongside transportation fuels. © OECD 2011.",,,Book,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84957784425

Researchers have seen enormous potential for energy savings from efficiency improvements in all energy sectors. They have pointed out, for example, that only 3 % of the primary energy in the coal feedstock to a power station finishes up as useful lighting if an incandescent bulb is used, and that only 15-20 % of the energy in the petrol tank actually drives the wheels. Energy efficiency is regarded as having the potential to ameliorate both energy availability and climate change problems, and even local air pollution. This chapter looks in detail at the considerable energy savings potential in the transport, buildings (including office and domestic equipment) and energy conversion sectors. But actual experience in recent decades has shown that while in the growth-oriented global economy, energy efficiency is steadily increasing, so is global energy use. Energy efficiency is valued in our economy, but so are time efficiency (speed), land-use efficiency in agriculture, labour efficiency etc, and these can all conflict with energy efficiency. For this and other reasons, there are formidable barriers to achieving the energy reduction potentials that research has identified as possible.",,"Agricultural robots; Climate change; Economics; Energy conversion; Energy efficiency; Energy security; Energy utilization; Land use; Climate change mitigation; Domestic equipments; Efficiency improvement; Energy availability; Energy savings potential; Incandescent bulbs; Land use efficiency; Local air pollutions; Coal industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883637714

Nevertheless, despite this long history, the topic of global climate change has become a controversial one. Although nearly all climatologists think that continued anthropogenic releases of greenhouse gases at anything like current rates will lead to dangerous change, a small minority dissents. The observed change in climate is not regular; it proceeds in a jerky fashion, as evidenced by the year-to-year ups and downs in global average surface temperatures. This internal climate variability makes it very difficult to unambiguously ascribe observed anomalous climate patterns in the short term, allowing scepticism to flourish. In this chapter we examine the scientific basis of global climate change, and explain how mathematical models and the study of ancient climates can both help us to understand how climate could evolve in the future, for given levels of greenhouse gas emissions and land-use changes. We discuss what is happening in the polar regions, particularly the Arctic. Even if average global temperatures showed no further rise, local increases in the Arctic could lead to irreversible losses of the Greenland ice cap, with attendant global sea level rises. Most likely though, global temperatures will continue to rise, with additional adverse effects on water supply, health and food production, as well as natural ecosystems. Global climate change policies must have an ethical component. At least for the medium term, poor countries will bear the brunt of adverse climate change, for two reasons. First, most of the world's poor live in the tropics, which is expected to experience declines in agricultural output. Such declines could be catastrophic for the many largely agricultural countries with still-rising populations. Second, low income countries have neither the financial resources, nor, in many cases, the administrative capacity, to successfully adapt to rapid climate change. As stressed by climatologist Michael Mann, ongoing climate change will see a net redistribution of resources, mainly from the low- to the high-income countries. A stress on individual country adaptation, rather than on mitigation, will worsen this inequality in consequences.",,"Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate models; Developing countries; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land use; Sea level; Water supply; Global climate changes; Global sea level rise; Global temperatures; Internal climate variability; Low income countries; Rapid climate change; Rising temperatures; Surface temperatures; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883635528

Several sequestration approaches are possible. Carbon capture and storage can only be applied to present emissions from large CO2 emitting sources such as power stations. Another possible approach is to capture CO2 directly from the air. Carbon sequestration in forests, soils, or in ocean plankton, are of this type, as is mechanical air capture. Mechanical air capture can in principle also draw down past CO2 emissions into the atmosphere, and even compensate for emissions of other greenhouse gases. However, the energy costs for capture are very high, so that energy availability becomes a problem. The sequestration phase is the same as for CO2 from fossil fuel combustion. Sequestering CO2 in the deep ocean would lead to both ocean acidification and adverse consequences for marine life. Estimates for the quantity of CO2 that can be ultimately sequestered in geological formations such as disused oil and gas fields, and saline aquifers, both on land and in the seabed, vary by orders of magnitude. But such estimates may be beside the point, since sequestration requires not only that adequate safe geological storage capacity be available, but that CO2 can be safely introduced at the rate desired, which could amount worldwide to tens of Gigatonne of CO2 per year. Furthermore, there is a small risk of catastrophic blowout from injection wells, which means that local citizen opposition could be intense.",,"Aquifers; Carbon capture; Energy efficiency; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Offshore gas fields; Alternative energy source; Atmospheric concentration; Carbon sequestration; Energy availability; Fossil fuel combustion; Geological formation; Ocean acidifications; Orders of magnitude; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84883612441

Some researchers point out that our present manipulation of atmospheric CO2 content could be considered geoengineering, so that we are really discussing what type of geoengineering is appropriate. Geoengineering has been promoted as our fall-back option for combating global warming. However, like carbon capture and sequestration, geoengineering schemes are single-purpose technical fixes for climate change mitigation, which would leave the questions of energy availability and other global environmental problems untouched. Crucially, it does nothing to address the 'other' CO2 problem-ocean acidification. In this chapter we will restrict our discussion to large-scale schemes directed at counteracting the effects of rising GHGs by altering the Earth's albedo-the proportion of insolation that is reflected back to space. A large number of schemes have been proposed, some of which would alter the planetary albedo as a whole, while others would act on a more regional scale, with correspondingly more regional effects. Geoengineering can be implemented rapidly, and at projected costs much lower than the alternatives. Research shows, however, that it is not possible to simultaneously bring about present temperature and precipitation conditions.

Because THz frequencies are well below the room temperature thermal emission maximum, this configuration may realize a low power but extremely low cost incoherent broadband THz source. Electromagnetic crystals are structures whose periodicity either enhances or reduces the associated photonic density of states over some frequency range. Consequently, they either enhance or reduce its thermal emission over the same frequency range. Thermal radiation from electromagnetic crystals has been studied theoretically and experimentally for higher frequency ranges, but usually for infinite lattices. We have experimentally and theoretically investigated a simple 1D, bi-layered electromagnetic crystal structure composed of air and silicon slabs. We have calculated the emissivity using Kirchhoff's thermal radiation law, as well as by calculating the density of states directly, and have compared successfully those results to the experimental values. Our ultimate goal is to be able to control the spectral emission of an electromagnetic crystal in the THz region (or other wavelength ranges, such as the infrared) by engineering its band structure. Controlled thermal emission, i.e., thermal management, could be used for applications as diverse as solar energy convertors, thermoelectric devices, and integrated circuits. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","electromagnetic crystal; thermal radiation; THz radiation","1-D photonic crystal; Density of state; Electromagnetic crystals; Experimental values; Frequency ranges; Higher frequencies; Infinite lattices; Kirchhoff; Low costs; Low Power; Photonic density; Room temperature; Silicon slabs; Spectral emission; Thermal emissions; Thermal management; thermal radiation; Thermal radiations; Thermoelectric devices; THz frequencies; THz radiation; THz sources; Wavelength ranges; Electromagnetic wave refraction; Electromagnetism; Frequency bands; Heat radiation; Photonic crystals; Solar energy; Terahertz waves; Crystal structure",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957985328

The assessment examined carbon storage, carbon fluxes, and other GHG fluxes (methane (CH4 ) and nitrous oxide (N2O)) in all major terrestrial eco-systems (forests, grasslands/shrublands, agricultural lands, and wetlands) and freshwater aquatic systems (rivers, streams, lakes, and impoundments) in two time periods: baseline (generally in the first half of the 2010s) and future (projections from baseline to 2050). The assessment was based on measured and observed data collected by the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) and many other agencies and organizations and used remote sensing, statistical methods, and simulation models. The major findings are as follows: • The Great Plains region (2.17 million square kilometers) is predominantly grasslands/shrublands (48 percent of the total area) and agricultural lands (42 percent). Forests (5.35 percent), wetlands (1.4 percent), water bodies (1.16 percent), and other lands (developed and barren lands, 1.73 percent) complete the rest of land cover in the region. Land-use and land-cover (LULC) change is a major driver of changes in carbon storage. Future LULC change in the region, projected using the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) scenarios, is largely driven by the demand for agricultural commodities (including biofuels), resulting in the significant expansion of agricultural land (1.4 to 9.2 percent of the total area by 2050, depending upon which scenario is used in the calculation) at the expense of grasslands/shrublands (-2.2 to -9.3 percent) and forests (0.0 to -0.5 percent). • Greenhouse-gas emissions from natural and manmade wildland fires are a key component of the assessment. The amount of area burned and the GHG emissions for the Great Plains region are highly variable both spatially and temporally, but the estimates for the amount of area burned are not expected to increase substantially over time, and the resulting GHG emissions are expected to increase just slightly for a range of climate projections. Grassland fires are the most common type of fire in the region, and they yield average GHG emissions (including carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2 ), and methane (CH4 )) of 0.18 to 24.72 teragrams of carbon-dioxide equivalents per year (TgCO2-eq /yr). Currently, the national GHG inventory report by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) does not include data on the emissions from fires in grasslands/shrublands areas. If included, fire emissions could increase by up to 8 percent of the current reported amount for the Nation. • The total area covered by aquatic systems in the Great Plains region is small (1.16 percent); however, lateral transfer over the water surface ranged from 0.07 to 0.31 teragrams of carbon per year (TgC/yr) within the region, and vertical evasion into the atmosphere emitted 12.8 to 24.6 TgC/yr as CO2 from rivers, streams, lakes, and impoundments. Because the methods used to estimate aquatic fluxes are not explicitly coupled with methods used to calculate terrestrial estimates, it is uncertain how much of the aquatic fluxes actually may stem from terrestrial sources. • The baseline (average of 2001-2005) carbon stock estimate for terrestrial ecosystems in the Great Plains region is approximately 7,500 TgC (only the top 20 centimeters (cm) of the soil layer was considered with regard to soil organic carbon), which is distributed in agricultural lands (45.8 percent), grasslands/shrublands (34.9 percent), forests (15.5 percent), wetlands (2.9 percent), and other lands (0.9 percent). Annual carbon sequestration in the region ranged between 20 and 99 TgC/yr during 2001 to 2005. • By 2050, the total potential carbon stock for terrestrial ecosystems in the region is projected to increase to a range of 9,665 to 10,228 TgC, depending on the projection scenarios. The increase in carbon stock translates to a potential total sequestration of 2,165 to 2,728 TgC between baseline and 2050, or a mean annual sequestration of 48 to 61 TgC. The projected amount of carbon that would be stored by 2050 for the region is distributed in agricultural lands (47 percent), grasslands/shrublands (29 percent), forests (20.4 percent), wetlands (2.9 percent), and other lands (0.75 percent). Two factors-(1) the projected expansion of agricultural lands and (2) the tendency of croplands in the region to be associated with favorable ecosystem conditions (such as fertile soil and temperate climate, which lead to relatively high soil carbon stock)-explain why agricultural lands may still contain the most carbon stocks by 2050. The increase of forest carbon density and sequestration are projected on existing forests owing to the effects of CO2 fertilization and a projected low level of forest harvesting. Temporally, the rate of sequestration is expected to remain steady and decrease slightly over the projection period as the result of the projected increased LULC change and gradual saturation of carbon storage capacity. • Methane (CH4 ) emissions from wetlands and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from agricultural lands are high for the Great Plains region. When combined, they yield a baseline total of 240 TgCO2-eq /yr (82 TgCO2-eq /yr from CH4 and 158 TgCO2-eq /yr from N2O). By 2050, N2O emissions are expected to increase by 7 to 11 percent. The expected change of CH4 emissions will range from a slight decrease of 1.6 percent to an increase of 16 percent. Up to 85 percent of the amount of GHG emissions may be offset by carbon sequestration in the region in terms of the impact on atmospheric warming. • Carbon storage and sequestration are affected by LULC and LULC change in the Great Plains region. Conversions between major ecosystems (for example, converting grasslands/shrublands and forests to agricultural lands) may lead to a cumulative reduction in stored carbon between 26 and 157 TgC from the baseline to 2050 (depending on the scenario), or up to a 4 percent loss of the mean total carbon sequestration of the region during the same time period. Although afforestation in the region may result in a small increase in the total carbon stock, the potential loss of carbon from the conversion of forests to agricultural land is much greater. The loss of carbon storage may be most noticeable in the northern portion of the region because of the relatively low agricultural productivity. • Climate is another important factor affecting carbon storage and sequestration in the Great Plains region. Although climate projections were simulated for the IPCC scenarios, the effects of climate fluctuations and change have not yet been fully examined. The effects of climate change in the region may include droughts (such as those that occurred between 2002 and 2003), floods (such as those in 2011), as well as extreme fluctuations in temperature and moisture availabilities, which could change the direction of carbon sequestration by the region's ecosystems. • Uncertainties in the assessment results remain high because of (1) insufficient input data for various components of the assessment, and (2) inherent uncertainty related to the structure and the parameterization of methods and models that were used in the assessment. An improved approach that would integrate all the major uncertainty elements is needed for future assessments. • This assessment provides new data and maps to users showing where carbon storage opportunities and vulnerabilities are located and how they are distributed over time. Within the limits of the resolution of a national assessment, the data and maps may be used to inform climate change mitigation and adaptation decisions while empowering the protection and restoration of other valuable ecological services that are important to society's welfare and quality of life. Conserving natural land cover (such as forests and grasslands/shrublands) and maintaining agricultural soil sequestration (while finding ways to reduce nitrous oxide and methane emissions) are effective land-management practices for protecting carbon stocks in the region.",,"Agricultural commodities; Agricultural land; Agricultural productivity; Agricultural soils; Aquatic system; Atmospheric warming; Barren land; Carbon density; Carbon fluxes; Carbon sequestration; Carbon stocks; Carbon storage; Climate change mitigation; Climate fluctuations; Climate projection; Ecological services; Energy independence; Fertile soils; Fire emissions; Forest harvesting; Future assessment; GHG emission; GHG flux; Grassland fires; Greenhouse-gas emissions; Input datas; Intergovernmental panel on climate changes; Inventory Report; Land cover; Land use and land cover; Low level; Methane emissions; National assessment; Nitrous oxide; Observed data; Potential loss; Projection period; Protection and restoration; Quality of life; Soil carbon stock; Soil layer; Soil organic carbon; Temperate climate; Terrestrial ecosystems; Time-periods; Total carbon; U.S. Environmental Protection Agency; U.s. geological surveys; Water surface; Waterbodies; Wildland fire; Agriculture; Anesthetics; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Climate change; Computer simulation; Ecosystems; Estimation; Fires; Gas emissions; Greenhouses; Lakes; Methane; Nitrogen oxides; Reforestation; Remote sensing; Soil conservation; Soils; Wetlands; Greenhouse gases; adaptive management; agricultural soil; biogeochemical cycle; biogeochemistry; carbon dioxide; carbon flux; carbon sequestration; climate change; data acquisition; data set; emission inventory; fire behavior; forest cover; freshwater ecosystem; future prospect; gas flow; geological survey; grassland; greenhouse gas; harvesting; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; land management; land use change; methane; nitrous oxide; parameterization; quality of life; shrubland; Great Plains; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863333574

This study simulated the carbon cycles under these changes using process-based ecosystem models. The Integrated Biosphere Simulator (IBIS), a Dynamic Global Vegetation Model (DGVM), was used to evaluate the impacts of climate change and CO 2 fertilization on net primary production (NPP), net ecosystem production (NEP), and the vegetation structure of terrestrial ecosystems in Zhejiang province (area 101,800 km 2, mainly covered by subtropical evergreen forest and warm-temperate evergreen broadleaf forest) which is located in the subtropical climate area of China. Two general circulation models (HADCM3 and CGCM3) representing four IPCC climate change scenarios (HC3AA, HC3GG, CGCM-sresa2, and CGCM-sresb1) were used as climate inputs for IBIS. Results show that simulated historical biomass and NPP are consistent with field and other modelled data, which makes the analysis of future carbon budget reliable. The results indicate that NPP over the entire Zhejiang province was about 55 Mt C yr -1 during the last half of the 21 st century. An NPP increase of about 24 Mt C by the end of the 21 st century was estimated with the combined effects of increasing CO 2 and climate change. A slight NPP increase of about 5 Mt C was estimated under the climate change alone scenario. Forests in Zhejiang are currently acting as a carbon sink with an average NEP of about 2.5 Mt C yr -1. NEP will increase to about 5 Mt C yr -1 by the end of the 21 st century with the increasing atmospheric CO 2 concentration and climate change. However, climate change alone will reduce the forest carbon sequestration of Zhejiang's forests. Future climate warming will substantially change the vegetation cover types; warm-temperate evergreen broadleaf forest will be gradually substituted by subtropical evergreen forest. An increasing CO 2 concentration will have little contribution to vegetation changes. Simulated NPP shows geographic patterns consistent with temperature to a certain extent, and precipitation is not the limiting factor for forest NPP in the subtropical climate conditions. There is no close relationship between the spatial pattern of NEP and climate condition.","Carbon cycle; DGVM; Dynamic global vegetation model; Global warming; NEP; Net ecosystem production; Net primary production; NPP; Subtropical China; Vegetation change","biomass; broad-leaved forest; carbon budget; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; climate change; climate conditions; ecosystem modeling; evergreen forest; forecasting method; general circulation model; Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; net ecosystem production; net primary production; subtropical region; vegetation cover; China; Zhejiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80655127901

The main plant types in the desert grassland at an altitude between 2100 and 2600 m are Calligonum roborovskii, Ceratoides latens, Sympegma regelii, and Seriphidium korovinii Poljak which are the very important source of livestock food in winter. The plant over conserves water, prevents wind erosion, and maintains ecological stability. Desertification in this area became a serious problem recently and caused sandstorms, erosion as well as sand deposition. Researches on protection and recovery of the vegetation on the northern slope of the Kunlun Mountains are of great importance. C. roborowasikii, C. latens, S. regelii and S. korovinii, are very important four species on the northern slope of Kunlun Mountain. The gas exchange of these plants is closely related to the ecological conditions. It is an effective way to reveal the mechanism of plant adaptation to environmental conditions. Water potential is the most sensitive degree of water condition in plant. Low water potential indicates good water condition of the plant. Accordingly, high water potential reflects that the plant lies in drought stress. Water use efficiency is an important index to distinguish the ability of the plants adapt to drought environment. It can be divided into instantaneous water use efficiency and long-term water use efficiency. Long-term water use efficiency is difficult to be acquired. Many studies suggested that stable carbon isotopic content and long-term water use efficiency are closely related. The content of carbon isotopes in plant leaves is used as an indicator for long-term water use efficiency. The technology has been widely used in plant physiology ecological research. In this study, gas exchange, water potential characteristics in seasonal courses and δ13C values of these plants were studied. The results showed that the gas exchange diurnal courses of C. latens, C. roborowasikii and S. regelii displayed a single peak pattern with double peak pattern of S. korovinii. Within the four species, C. roborowasikii displayed a high Pn, Tr and the highest WUE; While those of S. regelii were low Pn and Tr; C. latens was high Pn and low Tr; S. korovinii displayed a low Pn, high Tr and the lowest WUE. The two decline of C. latens in Pn was due to the low carboxylation capacity of the leaf mesophyll; the effect of Gs contributed to the first deline of C. roborowasikii in 12:00-14:00, while the second decline might be due to the two factors. Different species had different mechanisms to adapt to drought stress. C. roborowasikii and S. korovinii maintained higher water potential to delay dehydration. Comparatively, C. latens and S. regelii maintained lower water potential to endure dehydration. When trying to establish the relationships of WUE and δ13C, only some species were found to have a good consistency.","δ13C values; Gas exchange parameters; Kunlun Mountains; Shrubs; Water potential","adaptive radiation; altitude; carbon isotope; dehydration; desertification; diurnal variation; drought stress; environmental conditions; gas exchange; grassland; habitat restoration; isotopic analysis; livestock; research work; restoration ecology; shrub; slope; species diversity; stabilization; vegetation type; water use efficiency; China; Kunlun Mountains; Taklimakan Desert; Xinjiang Uygur; Calligonum; Ceratoides latens; Seriphidium; Sympegma regelii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959736414

The SDM are used to establish large-scale climate factors, the regional statistical relationship between the climate factors using years of observations of atmospheric circulation, and to test the suitability of this relationship using independent observations. Furthermore, the relationship is applied to atmospheric general circulation models (Global atmospheric general circulation models, GCMs) to produce large-scale climate information and predict future regional climate change scenarios (such as temperature and precipitation). In recent years, a variety of sophisticated statistical downscaling methods have been developed to meet the needs of domestic and international climate prediction programs and to provide effective support for regional ecosystem management. However, the choice of different statistical methods in a particular region must be highly targeted and effective. It is widely accepted that reasonable and consistent meteorological input data is a critical factor for modeling regional climate change at different levels. Previous studies showed that the GCMs provide the means of estimating climate change in the future by providing a time series of climatic variables. However, there are two main problems if GCM outputs are directly used for regional impact studies: 1) they are biased with respect to observations of present climate, and 2) the spatial scale is frequently too coarse. Therefore, dynamic downscaling methods employ regional climate models (RCMs), using the output of GCMs as forcing and boundary conditions. The RCMs provide sufficient information for ecological and hydrological modeling of the impact of expected climate change at different levels. Over the last decade, quite a few studies on the SDMs have been conducted and applied in ecological prediction. The recently proposed theory ""coupling human and natural systems"" provides us with the possibility of incorporating the SDM in ecological prediction. In this paper, we designed a flow chart to illustrate the method of ecological forecasting. Due to the complexity of ecological processes, we collected a series of factors including social and natural factors which influence the changes in ecosystem and regional climate. The model proposed here will undoubtedly validite and emphasize the importance of the accuracy of the results on ecological forecasting. In the past 10 years, some scholars have developed new techniques or methods to forecast ecological phenomena, such as biological invasion, agroecological safety, forest carbon sinks, biological diversity change, the ecological carrying capacity and other forecasts. Significant breakthroughs have been achieved in the SDMs of the interactions between climate change and ecological forecasts. Recent advances on connotation and extension of the concept, basic principles and operating procedures of SDMs were summarized. This paper summarizes the applicable progress, hot issues and developmental trends of the SDMs in simulating regional climate change. The review provides some initial approaches for the construction of meteorological and ecological prediction models and serves as a reference for related research.","Advances; Ecological forecasts; Estimation of regional climate; Global change; Statistical downscaling methods","agroecology; atmospheric circulation; climate change; climate variation; data set; downscaling; ecosystem management; environmental factor; forecasting method; general circulation model; hydrological modeling; meteorology; numerical model; observational method; prediction; regional climate; spatial analysis; statistical analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957843948

Compared with the planted restoration model, the natural recovery model was better in conserving plant biodiversity, the species richness and Shannon-Wiener index of plant communities in the natural recovery area were much higher than those in the planted restoration area, but the tendency of Pielou index was on the contrary. The plant community in the natural recovery area was more stablein that its soil salt and pH were higher than those in the planted restoration area. These results might be meaningful for selecting effective restoration model at desert front.","Ecosystem servies; Plant diversity; Soil property; Vegetation restoration; Wind","biodiversity; climate change; desert; ecological modeling; ecosystem service; environmental factor; pH; plant community; restoration ecology; soil fertility; species diversity; species richness; vegetation structure; wind velocity; China; Xinjiang Uygur",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957796078

This study analyzes the spatial distribution and spatial drivers of total and sectoral fossil fuel CO 2 emissions at the state and county levels in the United States. The spatial patterns of absolute versus per capita fossil fuel CO 2 emissions differ substantially and these differences are sector-specific. Area-based sources such as those in the residential and commercial sectors are driven by a combination of population and surface temperature with per capita emissions largest in the northern latitudes and continental interior. Emission sources associated with large individual manufacturing or electricity producing facilities are heterogeneously distributed in both absolute and per capita metrics. The relationship between surface temperature and sectoral emissions suggests that the increased electricity consumption due to space cooling requirements under a warmer climate may outweigh the savings generated by lessened space heating. Spatial cluster analysis of fossil fuel CO 2 emissions confirms that counties with high (low) CO 2 emissions tend to be clustered close to other counties with high (low) CO 2 emissions and some of the spatial clustering extends to multistate spatial domains. This is particularly true for the residential and transportation sectors, suggesting that emissions mitigation policy might best be approached from the regional or multistate perspective. Our findings underscore the potential for geographically focused, sector-specific emissions mitigation strategies and the importance of accurate spatial distribution of emitting sources when combined with atmospheric monitoring via aircraft, satellite and in situ measurements.

Results show that: significant regional differences in TFP exist, and under the two scenarios, the eastern China has the highest TFP, followed by middle China and western China. Moreover, the slow-down of the TFP growth in scenario 2 is mainly because that the technology progress is discounted by the environmental factors.

An empirical challenge for testing this is the fact that residential location choice and transportation choice are jointly made by a household. Using the micro data from a unique survey conducted in Beijing in 2009, we take advantage of the fanggai housing with pre-determined residential locations to address this endogeneity. Heckman two-stage regression technique is also employed to control for possible self selection bias. We find that better subway accessibility reduces a typical resident's probability of owning a car but does not affect the subsequent mileage driven. Such findings hold for the fanggai housing sample with endogenous residential location. Therefore, the development of urban rail in Beijing does discourage driving through reducing auto ownership and thus has positive congestion-mitigating and environmental consequences. © The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.","Car ownership; Fanggai housing; Subway accessibility","Location; Project management; Railroads; Surveys; Traffic congestion; Transportation; Car ownership; Endogeneity; Environmental consequences; Rail construction; Regression techniques; Residential locations; Self-selection bias; Housing",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84928749161

An input-output model for carbon emissions is constructed. Based on urban household data for the period of 2003-2009, we calculate individual ECF and analyze its structural evolution. The results of this analysis show that the total ECF emission intensity increases when an individual's consumption is higher than 10000 yuan (which is the turning point). This implies that emission intensity increases with a luxury lifestyle whereas it is lower for lower-income households. As income continues to increase, China will continue to remain on a high carbon track. We hence suggest that, with increasing urban wealth there is a need for better policies, management and behavioural change in order to reduce the carbon emissions of households.

Conversion of CO2 to useful chemicals such as methane or syngas under mild reaction conditions has promising application prospects. TiO2 is well known as an excellent photocatalyst due to its reusable, inexpensive and easily available properties. However, the photocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction by TiO2 is low partly due to the fast recombination rate of photo-generated electron-hole pairs. Cerium is a particular lanthanide element which has two oxidation states - Ce(III) and Ce(IV). The oxidation states enable CeO2 to trap photo-generated electrons and thus reduce the electron-hole recombination rate. On the other hand, surface area and surface hydroxyl groups can also influence photocatalytic activity. SBA-15, a mesoporous silica with 1-D pores has been widely used as an effective support for catalyst. In this work, CeO2-TiO2 catalysts with varying compositions were first synthesized via sol-gel preparation method using cerium nitrate and titanium butoxide as precursors. CeO2-TiO2/SiO2 catalysts were finally prepared by adding SBA-15 into the Ce-Ti sol. The catalysts were characterized by XRD, BET, SEM, TEM, UV-vis diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, etc. The photocatalytic activity of CO2 reduction with water was evaluated under UV-vis irradiation.

In a previous study, we demonstrated that the high methane pressure (1, 4.5, and 8 MPa) stimulated in vitro SR-AOM activity. However, the information on the effect of high-pressure on the microbial community structure and architecture was still lacking. Results: In this study we analysed the long-term enrichment (286 days) of this microbial community, which was mediating SR-AOM in a continuous high-pressure bioreactor. 99.7% of the total biovolume represented cells in the form of small aggregates (diameter less then 15 m). An increase of the total biovolume was observed (2.5 times). After 286 days, the ANME-2 (anaerobic methanotrophic archaea subgroup 2) and SRB (sulphate reducing bacteria) increased with a factor 12.5 and 8.4, respectively.

Besides normal frequency support features, gas turbines in local electrical grids are often required to maintain the grid frequency under various situations, including emergencies, such as, loss of national grid connection or trip of a large consumer, etc. These requirements demand high performance and stability of GT control. On the other hand, the environmental aspects are becoming increasingly a public concern. In the past decades, remarkable progress has been made in combustion technologies of heavy-duty gas turbines. Lean premixing is a preferred technology for NOx emission reduction. Because of its flashback and extinction limits, a premix flame has usually a much narrower operation range compared to a diffusional one, adding tight constraint on GT control. This paper demonstrates a successful implementation of a model-based predictor, a proven control technique, in the closed loop control of the ALSTOM GT11N2 gas turbine. First, an online GT model, which is integrated into the GT control algorithm, was developed. By applying appropriate assumption and simplification, this model is capable of simulating the GT process over the whole load operation range with high dynamic accuracy. Secondly, a model-based predictor for accelerating slow measured signals was implemented. It dynamically compensates the system delays in the GT process and in the measuring instruments. Thirdly, the predictor was applied to the GT core control by replacing the measured signals with the accelerated signals. The original control structure was kept unchanged. In order to verify its performance and stability, the new control technique was validated on a real engine. Successful engine tests proved that the model-based predictor improves GT transient operation capabilities.

The objectives were to simulate the effect of grazing initiation dates on net returns to a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) - cattle (Bos taurus) enterprise, and to determine economically optimal dates of grazing initiation for selected grazing scenarios. A wheat grazing model was used to simulate the dual systems in north-central Oklahoma for six to eight grazing initiation dates (ranging from 10 October to 30 January), six stocking rates (SR 0.5 to 3 head ha-1), four planting dates (1 September to 1 October), three climate scenarios (dry, average, and wet), and an initial wet soil with 75% plant available water. Net returns were further estimated using an enterprise budget approach for the 1999 (favorable to beef production) and 2005 (neutral) markets. For the wheat-cattle production scheme studied in this work, grazing should be initiated as soon as wheat plants are anchored or top dry biomass reaches approximately 1120 kg ha-1, irrespective of planting dates and climate. As a rule of thumb, for initial wet soils, regardless of climate, the most profitable practices in the region are early September planting, early grazing initiation (before mid-November), and heavy stocking (1.5 to 3 head ha-1), while lower SR such as 0.5 are preferable for later grazing initiation. Uncertainty in net return pertaining grazing initiation timing decreases as SR decreases, indicating that high SR appeal to risk lovers and low SR to risk averters.","Cattle grazing; Decision support; Dual-purpose wheat; Model simulation; Turnout date","Cattle grazing; Decision supports; Dual-purpose wheat; Model simulation; Turnout date; Climatology; Decision support systems; Plants (botany); Profitability; Computer simulation; Bos; Bos taurus; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79951621784

The effect of fire on the physicochemical properties of soil in a artificial secondary forest of Pinus massoniana in the center of Guizhou Province, China was investigated. The trees had an average diameter at breast height (DBH) of 5. 6 to 19. 4 cm, an average height of 4. 11 to 18. 60 m, and average density of 500 to 2400 clumps/ hm2, and were studied using a comparison of burnt and unburnt plots in a karst mountain area covered by a Quaternary clay. In the surface soil (depth determined by the influence of the fire) of the burnt plots, capillary porosity and total porosity increased, and the soil bulk density and non-capillary porosity decreased, becoming 104. 0, 102. 2, 96. 0 and 79. 9% of their previous values, respectively. The water content of the soil quality and soil volume, and the maximum and minimum values of the soil's water holding capacity were 92. 5, 86. 9, 110. 0, and 111. 4% respectively. Also, the relative amount of organic matter, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and total potassium and the pH increased to 130. 8, 138. 0, 148. 7, 108. 3, and 101. 6% of their previous values, respectively, while the cation exchange capacity was reduced to 74. 2%. In contrast, the relative amount of hydrophilic dissolved organic nitrogen, effective phosphorus, available potassium and exchangeable bases were increased, being 185. 7, 301. 7, 201. 3 and 109. 7%, respectively. As a result of the forest fire, the organic matter carbonized, soil biota was reduced, the soil aggregates collapsed and the soil water stability was reduced with changes in the osmotic potential; hence, the texture was degraded in the surface soil. Because of the carbonization of the organic matter of the different litter layers of the burnt forest, a considerable amount of ash, small carbon particles and organic debris covered the surface soil, and infiltrated into the soil through the action of gravity and rain, and as a result the fertility of the surface soil increased. There were two changing trends for soil physicochemical properties: one of them was the influencing factors of the surface soil (IFS) which were much greater than those for the profile soil (IFP), and included variables such as soil bulk density, capillary porosity, total porosity, water contents of soil quality or soil volume, the maximum or minimum water holding capacities, the amount of soil organic matter, total phosphorus, total potassium, hydrophilic dissolved organic nitrogen, available potassium and pH value; the other was when soil properties representing IFS were less than the IFP, such as non-capillary porosity, the amount of total nitrogen, and effective phosphorus, cation exchange capacity and exchangeable bases in the burnt amd non-burnt forest soil. Physicochemical indices of the burnt and non-burnt forest soil rose or fell in the soil profile, and trends simulated either the power or logarithmic curve well. The changes in the physicochemical indices between the burnt and unburnt forest in the surface soil reflected mainly the impact of the fire, and mirrored chiefly the difference of the natural soil properties and the effect of the biological community on the regolith. The coefficients for the relationships between the plant dead ratio of tree layer and the surface soil bulk density (R = -0. 8250*, r0. 05 = 0. 7545, the same was as follows), the maximum and minimum water holding capacity, (R = 0. 7615* and R = 0. 7689*, respectively), the amount of organic matter, (R = 0.9035**, r 0. 01 =0. 8745, the same was as follows) and total nitrogen (R =0. 7558*) were remarkable. The dependence coefficients of the plant dead ratio of shrub layer to the surface soil bulk density (R =0. 8547*), capillary porosity (R = -0. 7597*), total porosity (R =-0. 7629*), water content of soil quality (R =-0. 7593*), maximum and minimum water holding capacities (R =-0. 9573** and R = -0. 9124**, respectively), the amount of organic matter (R = -0. 9436**), total nitrogen (R =-0. 8335*), total phosphorus (R = -0. 7599*), and available potassium (R = -0. 7995*) were also notable. The correlation coefficients for the shrub biomass loss ratio to surface soil bulk density, amount of organic matter and available potassium were R = 0. 7684*, R = 0. 7763* and R = -0. 7600*, respectively. Coefficients for the litter biomass loss to the pH value of surface soil indicated a very strong relationship existed between these two variables (R = 0.7550*). In addition, the correlation coefficients for the average DBH of the burnt forest to the surface soil bulk density, capillary porosity, total porosity, water content of soil quality, maximum and minimum water holding capacities, amount of organic matter, were notable, being R =0. 8085*, R =-0. 8162*, R =-0. 8077* and R =-0. 9556**, R =-0. 9153** and R =-0. 9049** and R =-0. 8120*, respectively.","Artificial secondary forest of masson pine; Forest fire; Karst mountainous area; Physical and chemical indices; Soil","biological invasion; bulk density; coniferous forest; drought stress; forest fire; karst; mountain region; pH; physicochemical property; porosity; secondary forest; shrub; soil organic matter; soil quality; soil surface; soil texture; water content; China; Guizhou; Pinus massoniana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054899055

Granger causality tests show that the industrial structure is the reason for the change of the emissions, but the latter is not a reason for the former. By building the decomposition model of CO2 emissions, the contribution of economic growth, industrial structure and technical efficiency to the growth of CO2 emissions are measured and three important conclusions are drawn: (1) the change in the total economy is the most important factor to promote the emissions;(2) the change in industrial structure has the different contribution to the emissions in different stages, in 1994-99 and 2006-09, the contribution rate is negative, which indicates that changes in industrial structure curb the emissions;(3) technical efficiency is the main factor to reduce emissions, but compared with the role of economic growth, the effect of technical efficiency is very limited. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Carbon dioxide emission; Industrial structure; Measures; Relationship; Shandong province","Carbon dioxide; Economics; Global warming; Industrial economics; Carbon dioxide emissions; Industrial structures; Measures; Relationship; Shandong province; Industrial emissions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961110151

This site experienced two cold early growing seasons (with temperature anomalies of 2-5 °C) in 2005 and 2008, and a severe summer drought in 2003. Results indicated that the low air temperature from January to March was the major factor controlling the inter-annual variations in net carbon uptake at this site, rather than the previously thought summer drought. The accumulative air temperature from January to February showed high correlation (R2=0.970, p&lt;0.001) with the annual net ecosystem production (NEP). This was due to the controls of early-month temperature on the plant phenology developing and the growing season length at this subtropical site. The cold spring greatly shortened the growing season length and therefore reduced the carbon uptake period. The eddy flux observations showed a carbon loss of 4.04 g C m-2 per growing-season day at this coniferous forest site. On the other hand, the summer drought also reduced the net carbon uptake strength because the photosynthesis was more sensitive to water deficit stress than the ecosystem respiration. However, the impact of summer drought occurred within a relatively shorter period and the carbon sequestration went back to the normal level once the drought was relieved. © 2011 Author(s).",,"air temperature; carbon sequestration; coniferous forest; drought; eddy; growing season; low temperature; net ecosystem production; nutrient uptake; phenology; photosynthesis; plantation forestry; subtropical region; temperature anomaly; temperature effect; temporal variation; China; Jiangxi; Qianyanzhou",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959580990

The accuracy of the localization results depend heavily on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the acoustic signals that used for calculation. But at present, the study on characteristics of leak acoustic emission in the cast iron pipe is insufficient. So in this paper, taken the cast iron pipe as the research object, several cases of acoustic emission phenomenon in the leaking pipe were studied by experiment in the municipal pipeline test bench. They are the different characteristic of the signals from the pipe with leakage and no-leakage, the different acoustic emission characteristics of the leakage in cast iron pipe under different hydraulic conditions, and some of the external interference to the acquisition of signals, etc. The experiment results show that the acoustic emission phenomenon of leakage in the pipe is very complex and the components of the frequencies in the leak noises are very rich. The autocorrelation of leak signals is poor, however the autocorrelation of the ambient noises is very strong. And the impact of different hydraulic conditions on amplitude is evident but the distribution of the spectrum is not obvious. © 2011 IEEE.","acoustic emission; autocorrelation; joint time-frequency analysis; leak detection","Acoustic emission characteristics; Acoustic signals; Ambient noise; External interference; Hydraulic conditions; Joint time-frequency analysis; Leak signals; Leaking pipes; Pipeline tests; Research object; Signaltonoise ratio (SNR); Water distribution pipes; Acoustic emission testing; Acoustic emissions; Acoustic noise; Autocorrelation; Cast iron pipe; Communication; Leak detection; Measurements; Signal processing; Water supply systems; Experiments",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84860608390

It was reported that the value of the product shipments by refineries in U.S. accounted for 9.32% of the entire manufacturing sector of the U.S. economy in 2007. On the other hand, air emissions from refineries and petrochemical plants are significant. The carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions from refineries account for about 4% of the global CO 2 emissions, close to 1 billion tons of CO 2 per year. Due to an increasing concern, specific policies for refinery emission control have been enacted, and these emission control polices will heavily affect U.S. petroleum refineries. When an emission reduction strategy is implemented in a petrochemical plant, it most likely causes more conservative design and operations, and requires higher capital investment and manufacturing costs. However, emissions in a petrochemical plant generally mean the loss of raw materials and energy which could supposedly generate products. Thus, emission reduction may possibly bring opportunities for the plant profit increment. In this paper, a process optimization model and a methodology were developed, which enabled profitable emission reduction (PER). The model includes major facilities of refinery and petrochemical plants. For each facility model, certain simplifications are made to reduce the model complexity, and meanwhile, keep the model accuracy. Facility models include material balance equations, property correlations, capacity constraints, and utility consumption correlations. Facility models are tuned and validated with actual operating data. The model is a multi-objective mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) model. The integer variables and constraints enable the model to optimize both process flowsheet and operating parameters. The objective functions include profit, energy consumption, carbon dioxide (CO 2) emission, volatile organic compounds (VOC), and nitrogen oxides (NO X). Pareto frontier method is employed to show relations of these objective functions. Optimization results give PER (profitable emissions reduction) region for various production schemes.

Smith Department of Chemical Engineering, Lamar University, Beaumont, TX, United States","Chemical industry concentrated regions experience highly localized and transient air pollution events. For instance, chemical plant flaring activities, especially intensive flaring during plant startup process, emit huge amounts of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO x), causing elevated ground-level ozone concentrations that violate the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. Emissions are inevitable during plant startups, their air quality impacts, however, are different under different meteorological conditions. This provides opportunities to identify cost-effective control strategies for reducing air quality impacts from plant start-up emissions. In this paper, detailed process system knowledge of plant startup emission and speciation is integrated with air quality modeling and simulation for the first time to quantitatively study regional air quality impact from ethylene plant startup emissions. The general process has three major steps: emission source characterization, flaring emission speciation and quantification, and air quality simulation and decision support. In the first step, plant-wide dynamic simulation and optimization are employed to minimize start-up emissions and identify benchmark emission dynamic profiles during a plant start-up. In the second step, simplified flaring emission speciation and quantification are conducted to identify dynamic profiles of ozone precursors, such as various VOC and NOx. Then, the flaring precursor information is input to the air quality model, CAMx. In the third step, multiple air quality simulations are performed for start-up emission impact analysis and decision support. This is the most complex step. Firstly, a background air quality simulation is performed. The simulation needs atmospheric reaction mechanism, geological domain information, emission inventory data, meteorology information, initial conditions and boundary conditions. The simulation gives temporal and spatial background ozone and other air pollutants distributions. It also gives different ozone formation mechanisms for different regions. Secondly, the startup procedures are arranged into different time windows, and start-up emissions are integrated into the background air quality model to generate different cases. Through multiple air quality simulations, regional air pollutant increments can be obtained. Through comparison and analysis, the best start-up time window will be identified. A typical ethylene plant startup procedure has been studied. Results show that local maximum ozone increment can be significant due to an ethylene start-up emission. However, if appropriate start-up time window is selected, the maximum ozone increment can also be substantially reduced comparing with the worst case.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863120516

Pot experiments were conducted in order to study the effects of different proportions of composted chicken manure-amended copper mine tailings on growth of three legumes (Cassia tora, Sesbania cannabina and Crotalaria juncea), soil microbial biomass, and activities of catalase, alkaline phosphatase, urease and dehydrogenase. A quantity of composted chicken manure (0, 8, 16, or 32 g) was incorporated with 4 kg mine tailings as the plants' potting substrate for the MA0 (CK), MA8, MA16, and MA32 treatments, respectively. Soil microbes are important components for maintenance of soil biological activity and affect the soil nutrient dynamics, energy conversion, and animal and plant community structure. The activity of soil enzymes is an important index of soil fertility and is often used to indicate remediation effects on polluted soils. In this study, with increasing proportion of chicken manure in the substrate, the shoot biomass and root biomass of the three plant species increased. In the same chicken manure treatment, the relative shoot biomass of the three species was C. juncea &gt; C. tora &gt; S. cannabina, but the root biomass did not differ significantly among the species. With increasing proportion of chicken manure, the total phosphorus content of the three plant species increased, and the total nitrogen content of C. juncea increased. The relative total nitrogen content in both the roots and shoots of the three plant species was C. juncea &gt; S. cannabina &gt; C. tora in the MA16 and MA32 treatments, the relative total phosphorus content in the roots was S. cannabina &gt; C. juncea &gt; C. tora in the MA8 and MA32 treatments, and the relative total phosphorus content in the shoots was S. cannabina &gt; C. tora &gt; C. juncea in the MA8 and MA32 treatments. The soil microbial biomass carbon for the three plant species was boosted by amendment with chicken manure. Among the species, the soil microbial biomass carbon of C. juncea was significantly improved compared to the control (chicken manure absent; CK) (P &lt; 0. 05). In the MA32 treatment, the soil microbial biomass carbon for C. juncea was 177. 56 mg/ kg, and the soil microbial biomass nitrogen of C. juncea was 9. 08 mg/ kg. The soil urease and dehydrogenase activities for the three legumes were boosted by amendment with chicken manure and were highest in the MA32 treatment. Of the three species, the soil urease activity of C. juncea reached 1. 52 μg·g-1·h-1, and the soil dehydrogenase activity of C. tora reached 0. 26 μg·g-1. d-1. Significant positive correlations existed between soil microbial biomass carbon and substrate total nitrogen and available phosphorus. Significant negative correlations existed between soil microbial biomass carbon and substrate available copper and zinc for C. juncea. Significant positive correlations existed between soil urease and dehydrogenase activities and substrate total nitrogen and available phosphorus with growth of S. cannabina and C. juncea, and between soil dehydrogenase activities and soil microbial biomass carbon with growth of C. tora and C. juncea. Significant negative correlations existed between soil urease and dehydrogenase activities and substrate available zinc with growth of C. tora. These findings indicate that the MA16 treatment (an amendment rate of 250 parts tailings to 1 part chicken manure) is a suitable method for chicken manure amendment of copper mine tailings, and Crotalaria juncea might be a preferred plant for ecological restoration of copper mine tailings using such treatment.","Chicken manure amendment; Copper tailings; Ecological restoration; Leguminous plants","bioactivity; biomass; community structure; copper; enzyme activity; experimental study; growth rate; heavy metal; legume; manure; nutrient dynamics; plant community; poultry; restoration ecology; shoot; soil amendment; soil fertility; soil microorganism; soil nutrient; soil pollution; tailings; wasteland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82955165743

As a very important economic sector, construction industry is one of the main sources of energy consumption and carbon emissions in China. The production of building materials play an important part in energy consumption and carbon emissions in construction industry. In addition, building materials production is an alterative way of reusing the solid wastes from coal-driving electric-generating plants which can significantly reduce the energy consumption or carbon emssions of building material industry. Coal fly ash and coal gangue are common industrial solid wastes from coal mining or coal combustion processes. The quantity of coal fly ash and coal gangue is very large especially in coal-resources- based region, for example Huaibei City in China. Novel wall materials can be produced from recycling coal fly ash and coal gangue which is an effective way of energy saving, resources conservation and mitigation of environmental hazards. In this study, we take the novel wall materials (fly ash block, coal gangue brick) made from industrial solid wastes and conventional wall materials (clay brick, perforated clay bricks) made from clay in Huaibei City as examples to analyze the eco-efficiency and carbon emissions of them. Then we established a linear programming model to regulate the production of four kinds of wall materials in order to achieve the highest eco-efficiency and reduce canbon emissions for wall material industry in Huaibei. The results show that the eco-efficiency of novel wall materials are higher than that of conventional ones. The carbon emissions of coal gangue brick is higher than that of conventional wall materials while the carbon emissions of fly ash block is between the clay brick and the perforated clay brick. In order to achieve the highest eco- efficiency and carbon reduction of wall material industry in Huaibei, the use of clay brick for building materials production should be forbidden and the production of perforated clay brick should be decreased while the production of coal gangue brick and the fly ash block should be increased. As a result, the ratio of recycling coal gangue solid wastes increased from 15. 8% to 25. 2%. These results can be useful in the identification of available techniques for building materials made from recycling industrial solid wastes.","Carbon emissions; Coal gangue; Eco-efficiency; Fly ash; Industrial solid wastes","building; carbon emission; coal mining; combustion; economic growth; electricity generation; emission control; energy conservation; environmental hazard; fly ash; recycling; research work; resource management; solid waste; Anhui; China; Huaibei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80054922630

In 2007, we conducted a reciprocal translocation experiment on 100 × 100 × 40 cm coherent turf and soil along an elevation gradient of 3200-3800 m on the south slope of Qilian Mountains northeast of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. The aim was to understand the warming/cooling effects on the alpine ecosystem where treatments were simulated by donor elevations below/above receptors. Translocated vegetation comprised the Kobresia meadow at 3200 m, deciduous shrub meadow at 3400 m, forbs meadow at 3600 m, and sparse vegetation at 3800 m. The 5 × 5 cm grid method (50 × 50 cm, 100 grids) was used for surveying plant species absolute abundance in translocated quadrats. Results showed that species richness and Shannon-Weaver index of Kobresia meadow increased significantly (P <0.05) when translocated to 3400 m. Shannon-Weaver index of shrub meadow declined, while shrub species abundance responded slightly both to warming and cooling treatments. Both species richness and Shannon-Weaver index of forbs meadow and sparse vegetation were enhanced evidently at 3200 m and 3400 m. Four groups were identified by non-metric multidimensional scaling based on receptor elevation. Responses of the alpine plant community and the function group appeared to be specific to climate magnitude and specific to function type, respectively. Correlation indicated that climatic factors played a much more important role than soil in the response of the alpine plant community. Four vegetation types were sensitive to climate change, while Kobresia meadow behaved flexibly. Global warming would depress sedges but favor legumes and graminoids.","Function group; Non-metric multidimensional scaling; Shannon-weaver index; Species richness","alpine environment; climate change; diversity index; functional group; global warming; legume; meadow; plant community; sedge; shrub; species richness; translocation; China; Qilian Mountains; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; Carex; Kobresia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864413372

However, due to the distributed nature of biomass feedstock, the cost and complexity of biomass recovery operations result in significant challenges that hinder the increased biomass utilization for energy production. This paper describes the development of a simulation model using Arena for the biomass supply chain for biofuel production in Michigan. The model describes the supply chain from landing sites to the biorefinery, including biomass harvesting, transportation, and on-site storage. The simulation model is driven by both the daily biomass production at harvesting sites distributed across a harvesting region and the daily demand for biomass feedstock at a biorefinery located in the center of the region. The supply chain model is evaluated using multiple criteria that include the delivered feedstock cost, energy consumption, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Other considerations include the average age of the in-field biomass inventory and road restrictions associated with spring thaw that limit use of truck transportation on certain roads. The utility of the supply chain simulation model is demonstrated by considering a biomass supply chain for a biorefinery in the lower peninsula of Michigan.","Biomass supply chain; Delivered feedstock cost; Energy consumption; Greenhouse gas emissions; Simulation","Bioconversion; Biofuels; Computer simulation; Costs; Energy utilization; Exhibitions; Feedstocks; Greenhouse gases; Harvesting; Refining; Supply chains; Truck drivers; Biomass inventories; Biomass productions; Biomass supply chain; Biomass utilization; Delivered feedstock costs; Simulation; Supply chain modeling; Supply chain simulation; Biomass",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84900328228

Currently, no one can doubt the importance of low carbon living and low carbon architecture. Numerous new materials and high technologies have been used in the country all over the world in the course of low carbon architecture's development, some of which has had a favorable result, such as London zero carbon emissions pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai World Expo. But China still is a developing country, for various reasons, it is premature to widely promote the expensive high-tech low-carbon buildings, and especially in the vast rural areas, the traditional local materials and suitable technology still could have general applicability. This paper takes the rammed earth building as example, by introducing the history of rammed earth building, the application status and some of the latest instances, and summarizes several advantages of rammed earth building: the first is that easy manufacturing processing could reduce the energy consumption; the second is that local materials could lower transportation costs; the third is that the clay materials with good thermal performance such as heat insulation and moisture property could ensure comfortable indoor environment, the last is that long service life and easy reclamation could recycle building materials. Then the author looks forward to the future development trends of rammed earth buildings, explores the new construction practices of rammed earth buildings. Finally this paper concludes that traditional local materials and suitable technology would play an important role in the modern low-carbon architecture.","Local materials; Low-carbon buildings; Rammed earth building; Suitable technology","Carbon emissions; Carrying capacity; Clay materials; Development trends; Energy consumption; Future generations; Heat insulation; High technology; Indoor environment; Local materials; Long service life; Low-carbon; Moisture properties; New constructions; New material; Rammed earth buildings; Suitable technology; Thermal Performance; Transportation cost; Architecture; Building materials; Construction equipment; Curricula; Developing countries; Energy utilization; Rural areas; Technology; Thermal insulation; Materials handling",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78651267712

Therefore, we calculated the spatial relationships on carbon emissions and its influence factors, and estimated the factors' coefficient by GWR. The carbon emissions coefficient is in the range of 0.868 to 2.650 from energy structure. The carbon emissions coefficient is in the range of 0.868 to 2.650 from industrial structure.

Hence, HC1 ∼a HC2, where 'a' is constant for any two HC pairs and is independent of engine type or power condition. This presentation will explore the causes for this 'universal' fingerprint for hydrocarbon emissions. We focus on conditions that define idle and part power operation which is where hydrocarbon emission levels are large enough to be identified and quantitatively detected. Specifically, the emission indices of the hydrocarbons are on the order of 1 gram/kilogram of fuel. At these low power conditions, the front end of the combustor is operating overall lean to near stoichiometric yet fuel-rich, stoichiometric and fuel-lean pockets of gases may be present locally. We analyze this problem by using a network series of reactors and full detailed chemical kinetics using a surrogate for jet fuel to simulate the combustion behavior in the burner. Our preliminary conclusion is that the hydrocarbon fingerprint is consistent with an assumption by which the reacting fuel is excessively and rapidly quenched (∼10 μsec.) to very lean conditions (phi &lt; 0.2) at which point, for the low power conditions, reaction times are too long for further oxidation of the hydrocarbon or their oxygenated species. The finite rate of the quenching process may play an important role in such emissions.",,"Carbon; Chemical analysis; Combustion; Engines; Exhaust systems (engine); Fighter aircraft; Fuels; Gas emissions; Gas turbines; Combustion behavior; Detailed chemical kinetic; Gas turbine emissions; Hydrocarbon emission; Hydrocarbon fingerprints; Near stoichiometric; Oxygenated species; Quenching process; Hydrocarbons",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84946762019

At the same time, the Russian East regions (which is also the part of the NEA) have significant oil and gas reserves and demands considerable economic development. In this paper we calculate the cost-based price of gas in a possible gas supply project from Russia to Korea. That price includes: the gas production cost in the prospective gas fields in Russian East regions, gas pipeline transportation cost across Russia to the Pacific coast, and further gas transportation by gas pipeline through the Korean Peninsula or transportation of gas by tankers as liquefied natural gas (LNG), to the Korean consumers. Our calculations show that the estimated cost-based price of Russian gas in Korea in constant 2011 US dollars during the period of the possible contract from 2017 to 2041 could be as follows: for PNG (pipeline natural gas) 12.91 $/MBtu (468 $/1000m3), and for LNG 13.22 $/MBtu (479 $/1000m3), which is rather competitive under the projected oil price between 18.37 and 25.79 $/MBtu or 106 and 150 $ per barrel of crude oil. This suggests that supplying Russian natural gas to Korea is cost effective in either PNG or LNG form.","Energy cooperation; Gas pipeline; Gas supply cost; Korea; LNG; Northeast Asia","Costs; Economics; Electronic guidance systems; Energy resources; Environmental impact; Gas industry; Gas pipelines; Liquefied natural gas; Natural gas pipelines; Natural gas transportation; Regional planning; Economic development; Energy cooperation; Korea; Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG); Northeast Asia; Pipe-line transportations; Regional economic development; Supply costs; Gas supply",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903648419

In this paper we model the dispersion of the emissions from a freeway traffic using a grid-based approach where the variability of the speed and direction wind is considered into account. The model is developed in such a way that the computation time is less than a previously proposed point-source model, while still capturing the important dispersion dynamics so that it can be used for on-line control applications. In order to reduce the-dispersion of emissions to a neighborhood we design a parameterized model predictive control (MPC) strategy to optimize variable speed limits and ramp metering rates. We illustrate the proposed dispersion model and control approach with a simulation-based case study. © 2011 IEEE.",,"Area-wide; Computation time; Control and management; Control approach; Control strategies; Dispersion models; Freeway traffic; Grid-based approach; On-line controls; Parameterized model; Ramp metering; Residential areas; Simulation-based; Traffic emissions; Traffic jams; Variable speed limits; Computer simulation; Dispersions; Emergency traffic control; Highway traffic control; Predictive control systems; Traffic congestion; Transportation; Model predictive control",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052401679

Geological storage of CO2 is perceived to be one of the most promising methods that could provide significant reduction in CO2 emissions over the short and medium term. Since a major concern regarding geological storage is the possibility of leakage, trapping CO2 in the solid form is quite attractive. Unlike mineral trapping, the kinetics of CO2-hydrate formation is quite fast, providing the opportunity for long-term storage of CO2. In this paper, we study storage of CO2 at conditions similar to those at depleted gas pools of Northern Alberta. Thermodynamic calculations suggest that CO2 hydrate is stable at temperatures that occur in a number of formations in Northern Alberta, in an area where significant CO2 emissions are associated with production of oil sands and bitumen. Numerical simulation results presented in this paper suggest that, upon CO2 injection into such depleted gas reservoirs, pressure would initially rise until conditions are appropriate for hydrate formation, enabling storage of large volumes of CO2 in solid form. These results show that, because of tight packing of CO2 molecules in the solid (hydrate), the CO 2 storage capacity of these pools is many times greater than their original gas-in-place. This provides a local option for storage of a portion of the CO2 emissions there. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Depleted gas reservoir; Hydrate; Storage","Climate change; Energy storage; Gas hydrates; Gases; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Hydrates; Hydration; Oil sands; Petroleum reservoirs; Storage (materials); Depleted gas reservoir; Geological storage; Hydrate formation; Long-term storage; Mineral trapping; Original gas in places; Storage capacity; Thermodynamic calculations; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955435031

This study assesses the effect of anthropic land use on the present-day climate in these regions, and computes the climate associated with the PNV through iteration of a 2-step procedure, composed of a multi-annual model simulation and subsequent computation by VERDE of the PNV corresponding to the simulated climate. In the first iteration, RegCM adopts the present land use (which over Europe is dominated by crops and farming, with very little natural vegetation). The procedure is iterated until there is no appreciable difference between the PNV used by RegCM, and that associated with the climate that it produces, so that the PNV and model climate are consistent. The equilibrium PNV consists mainly of shrubs in the Mediterranean and deciduous broadleaf forest in central Europe. The effect of anthropic land use on climate is assessed by analyzing the difference between the simulated present-day anthropic land use and PNV climates, which is given by the difference between the first and the last iterations of the procedure. We found that anthropic land use produces cooler summers, and identified 2 different mechanisms: (1) over the Balkan Peninsula, anthropic land use modifies the surface energy balance by increasing evapotranspiration; (2) over central-western Europe, cooling is mostly due to cloudier sky conditions. These results show: (1) that reforestation may not be appropriate as a tool for climate change mitigation at the regional scale, and (2) expansion of agricultural land use may have reduced past warming signals at the regional scale, though historical records of land-use evolution suggest that this effect is probably small for Europe during the 20th century. © Inter-Research 2011.","Anthropic land use; Land cover; Potential vegetation; Regional climate","20th century; Agricultural land use; Anthropic land use; Broadleaf forest; Central Europe; Climate change mitigation; Diagnostic potential; Different mechanisms; Historical records; Land cover; Mediterranean region; Model simulation; Natural vegetation; Potential vegetation; Regional climate; Regional climate models; Regional scale; Sky condition; Surface energy balance; Climate change; Computer simulation; Land use; Reforestation; Revegetation; Surface chemistry; Vegetation; Water supply; Climate models; broad-leaved forest; climate change; climate modeling; cooling; deciduous forest; energy balance; equilibrium; historical record; human activity; land use change; Mediterranean environment; nature-society relations; numerical model; paleoclimate; reforestation; regional climate; shrub; summer; twentieth century; vegetation cover; Europe; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957666837

To recognize this relationship, a time series, co-integration and Granger Causality Tests have been employed. The study further evaluates four alternative but equally plausible hypotheses, each with different policy implications. These are: i) tourism indicators cause carbon emission (the conventional view), ii) carbon emission cause tourism indicators, iii) There is a bi-directional causality between the two variables and iv) both variables are causality independent (although highly correlated). The results reveal that tourism indicators significantly increase carbon emissions in Pakistan. The causality results only moderately support the conventional view that tourism indicators have significant long run casual effect on carbon emissions in Pakistan.

In particular, it has become the main way in which developed countries attempt to account and pay for their historic role in contributing to climate change. Climate finance, however, encourages the use of rigid negotiating tactics in international negotiations, and suffers from many of the endemic problems observed in other large-scale, international public resource transfers. It is argued that it would be better to move away from thinking of solutions in terms of ‘least-cost mitigation + adaptation’, to thinking of it in terms of ‘low-carbon economy + development’. Such a move permits the involvement of different political and economic actors (in particular, the private sector) and relevant institutions, and allows for greater cooperation, decentralization and competition. This avoids both the kind of intractable situations observed in the international climate negotiations and the endemic problems that large-scale international institutions inevitably suffer from, and moreover encourages national self-determination. The potential for this approach to climate change is illustrated by the case of the South African Renewables Initiative (SARi). © 2011 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Climate finance; Development assistance; Development goals; Economic development; International investment; Low-carbon economy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84979751938

A variational inversion scheme is combined with observations from the RAMCES and EUROHYDROS atmospheric networks, which include continuous measurements performed between mid-2006 and mid-2009. Net H 2 surface flux, then deposition velocity and surface emissions and finally, deposition velocity, biomass burning, anthropogenic and N2 fixation-related emissions were simultaneously inverted in several scenarios. These scenarios have focused on the sensibility of the soil uptake value to different spatio-temporal distributions. The range of variations of these diverse inversion sets generate an estimate of the uncertainty for each term of the H2 budget. The net H2 flux per region (High Northern Hemisphere, Tropics and High Southern Hemisphere) varies between -8 and +8 Tg yr-1. The best inversion in terms of fit to the observations combines updated prior surface emissions and a soil deposition velocity map that is based on bottom-up and top-down estimations. Our estimate of global H 2 soil uptake is -59±9 Tg yr-1. Forty per cent of this uptake is located in the High Northern Hemisphere and 55% is located in the Tropics. In terms of surface emissions, seasonality is mainly driven by biomass burning emissions. The inferred European anthropogenic emissions are consistent with independent H2 emissions estimated using a H2/CO mass ratio of 0.034 and CO emissions within the range of their respective uncertainties. Additional constraints, such as isotopic measurements would be needed to infer a more robust partition of H2 sources and sinks. © 2011 Author(s).",,"atmospheric chemistry; atmospheric deposition; biomass burning; carbon monoxide; emission; estimation method; hydrogen; isotopic analysis; measurement method; nitrogen fixation; Northern Hemisphere; seasonality; source-sink dynamics; troposphere; uncertainty analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953872660

Decomposition and analysis results show that FDI scale effect reduces the energy consumption intensity. FDI structure and technology effect fluctuates and do not promote the reduction of energy consumption intensity , on the whole. Therefore, to reduce the energy consumption intensity of Jiangsu Province, we suggest that while expanding FDI scale, we should adopt unified energy-saving and emission-reducing requirements to FDI enterprises and domestic ones. Meanwhile, we should increase the foreign investment proportion in the technology-intensive industries and encourage FDI enterprises to use and exchange advanced energy-saving technologies. Moreover, we should adjust the distribution industry structure of FDI to optimize the industrial structure adjustment. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Energy consumption intensity; FDI intensity effect; FDI production effect; FDI structure effect; LMDI","Energy conservation; Investments; Energy consumption intensity; FDI production effect; Intensity effect; LMDI; Structure effect; Energy utilization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961124340

However, detecting aerosol effect on cloud amount has been elusive to both observations and modeling due to potential buffering mechanisms and convolution of meteorology. Here through a natural experiment provided by long-term degassing of a low-lying volcano and use of A-Train satellite observations, we show modifications of trade cumulus cloud fields including decreased droplet size, decreased precipitation efficiency and increased cloud amount are associated with volcanic aerosols. In addition we find significantly higher cloud tops for polluted clouds. We demonstrate that the observed microphysical and macrophysical changes cannot be explained by synoptic meteorology or the orographic effect of the Hawaiian Islands. The ""total shortwave aerosol forcin"", resulting from direct and indirect forcings including both cloud albedo and cloud amount, is almost an order of magnitude higher than aerosol direct forcing alone. Furthermore, the precipitation reduction associated with enhanced aerosol leads to large changes in the energetics of air-sea exchange and trade wind boundary layer. Our results represent the first observational evidence of large-scale increase of cloud amount due to aerosols in a trade cumulus regime, which can be used to constrain the representation of aerosol-cloud interactions in climate models. The findings also have implications for volcano-climate interactions and climate mitigation research. © 2011 Author(s).",,"aerosol property; albedo; climate modeling; cloud droplet; cumulus; degassing; modeling; trade wind; volcanic aerosol; Hawaii [(ISL) Hawaiian Islands]; Hawaii [United States]; Hawaiian Islands; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960682774

We conducted the experiment by employing a three-series hybrid flow, cultivating plants in different seasons, and configuring the size and porosity of the substrate in different layers. The experiments consisted of two phases. In the first phase where eutrophic water was used as the inflow, results showed that water quality experienced two periods, instability and stability, stable after the 15th day. The average removal rates of chemical organic demand (COD), total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) were 71.62%, 60.00%, 91.44%, respectively. In the second phase, which the water concentration was increased (in order to simulate domestic waste water). In an operating cycle of 21 days, the system maintained relatively high impact resistance and stability, with average removal rates of COD, TP, TN reaching 80.59%, 92.60% and 97.71%, respectively; as a result, the effluent water quality met the Surface Water Environment Quality Standard Class and Urban Sewage Treatment Plant Emission Standards (an A class standard). This study demonstrates that this wetland treatment system can effectively remove organic matters, and N, P from the wastewater with different qualities, and still have treatment capability for sewage in a 1-year cycle. In addition, this system requires low investment, energy and management efficiency and therefore, it is likely an effective technology for the treatment of urban sewage and eutrophic water in small cities. © 2011 IEEE.","Constructed wetland; Eutrophic water; Removal rates of TN and TP; Sewage; Trifoluun repens Linn","Effluent treatment; Eutrophication; Investments; Multimedia systems; Nitrogen removal; Sewage; Sewage treatment plants; Surface waters; Wastewater treatment; Water quality; Wetlands; Constructed wetlands; Eutrophic water; High impact resistance; Nutrient concentrations; Removal rate; Trifoluun repens Linn; Urban sewage treatment; Wetland treatment system; Effluents",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052944170

In addition, by adding unidirectional carbon rods to the top of stiffeners and minimizing the interference between the sandwich frames and the rod-stiffened stringers, the panel becomes more structurally efficient.

Domestically available biomass has been proposed as part of the solution to our dependence on fossil fuels. Biofuels, especially liquid transportation fuels produced from cellulosic materials, have the benefits of significantly reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and leading to new jobs and greater economic vitality in rural areas. Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS), part of the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, establishes a target of 16 billion gallons of cellulosic biofuel annual production by 2022, although the United States produced less than 1 billion gallons of liquid fuels from cellulosic materials in 2010. In observance of this mandatory production target, many new cellulosic biomass-to-biofuels supply chains will be designed and developed in the coming decade for better economic, environmental and social performances. However, uncertainty resulting from supply and demand variations may have significant impact on the biofuel supply chain. Therefore, an efficient optimization strategy is urgently needed to for the design and operations of sustainable and robust cellulosic biofuel supply chains. In this work, we address the optimal design and planning of cellulosic biofuel supply chains under supply and demand uncertainty. A two-stage stochastic mixed-integer linear programming (SMILP) model combined with Monte Carlo sampling and the associated statistical analysis is proposed to deal with different types of uncertainty, and it is incorporated into a multi-period planning model that takes into account the main characteristics of the biofuel supply chains, such as seasonality of feedstock supply, biomass deterioration with time, geographical diversity and availability of biomass resources, feedstock density, diverse conversion technologies and byproducts, infrastructure compatibility, demand distribution, regional economic structure, and government incentives. In the two-stage framework, the supply chain network design and capacity planning decisions are made ""here-and-now"" prior to the resolution of uncertainty, while the production, transportation and storage decisions for each time period are postponed in a ""wait-and-see"" mode. The SMILP model integrates decision making across multiple temporal and spatial scales and simultaneously predicts the optimal network design, facility location, technology selection, capital investment, production operations, inventory control, and logistics management decisions. In order to solve the resulting large scale SMILP problems effectively, a decomposition algorithm based on sampling average approximation and multi-cut L-shaped method is proposed by taking advantage of the problem structure. In addition to the economic objective of minimizing the annualized net present cost, the SMILP model is also extended to integrate with life cycle assessment (LCA) and regional economic input-output (EIO) analysis through a multiobjective optimization scheme to include two other objectives: the environmental objective measured by life-cycle greenhouse gas emissions and the social objective measured by the number of accrued local jobs resulting from the construction and operation of the cellulosic biofuel supply chain. The multiobjective optimization framework allows the model to establish tradeoffs among the economic, environmental, and social performances of the cellulosic biofuel supply chains in a systematic way. The multiobjective optimization problem is solved with an ?-constraint method and produces Pareto-optimal curves that reveal how the optimal annualized cost and the supply chain network structure change with different environmental and social performance of the entire supply chain. The proposed optimization model and solution method is illustrated through county-level case study for the state of Illinois. Three major types of biomass, including crop residues, energy crops, and wood residues, and three major conversion pathways, including biochemical conversion, gasification followed by Fischer-Tropsch synthesis and fast pyrolysis followed by hydroprocessing are considered. Uncertainty information is generated from the time series analysis based on the historical data of biomass feedstock supply and liquid fuel demand. County-level results will be presented that provide regionally-based insight into transition pathways of biomass production and conversion. Computational results also demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed decomposition algorithm for the solution of large-scale SMILP problems.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863152464

From the oligotrophic South Pacific (10S) to the Subtropical Front (STF), we observed the maximum concentrations of CH4 in the subsurface layer which ranged from 2.7 to 3.9 nmol kg-1. South of the STF, higher levels of CH4 were often detected in both the surface and the subsurface layers. Elevated surface CH4 concentrations (3.4-6.1 nmol kg-1) south of the STF tended to be higher than those north of the STF. Higher CH4 were often concomitant with an increase in chlorophyll a levels in the Seasonal Ice Zone (SIZ). Considering that phytoplankton does not generate methane directly, the high CH4 production probably resulted from the grazing processes of Antarctic krill and/or zooplankton fed on phytoplankton and the subsequent microbial methanogenesis in addition to the aerobic CH4 production in the water column. Present results showed a good relation between surface CH4 data (&lt;50 m) and σθ between 10S and the Polar Front (PF), which allow us to provide interpolation/extrapolation schemes for CH4 concentration and sea-air CH4 flux in the wide area ([CH4] = 0.15 σθ - 0.98 (RMS = 0.21 nmol kg -1, r = 0.68, n = 49, p &lt; 0.001). The sea-air fluxes estimated during our survey were from 2.4 to 4.9 mol CH4 km-2 d -1 between 10S and the PF (54S), and from 0.8 to 2.3 mol CH 4 km-2 d-1 south of the PF, where the sea-air CH4 flux was largely affected by the wind speed. © 2011 by the American Geophysical Union.",,"Algae control; Chlorophyll; Methanation; Phytoplankton; Antarctic krill; Austral summers; Chlorophyll a; Dissolved methane; Ice zones; Methanogenesis; Polar Front; Southern Ocean; Subsurface layer; Subtropical front; Water columns; Wide area; Wind speed; Methane; air-sea interaction; biological production; chlorophyll a; concentration (composition); crustacean; dissolved gas; grazing; interpolation; marine ecosystem; methane; methanogenesis; microbial community; oligotrophic environment; phytoplankton; subtropical region; summer; water column; wind velocity; zooplankton; Pacific Ocean; Pacific Ocean (South); Southern Ocean; Euphausiacea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960232308

Although there are some studies on broad vulnerability assessment in Korea, there have been very few studies to develop and apply locally focused and specific sector-oriented climate change vulnerability indicators. Especially, there has seldom been any study to investigate the effect of an adaptation project on assessing the vulnerability status to climate change for fundamental local governments. The objective of this study is to create an index of flood vulnerability to climate change for the Korean fundamental local governments. The quantification of local vulnerabilities and the identification of the components degrading the vulnerability index would help fundamental local governments and the central government set up sound adaptation strategies. In this study, the modified climate change vulnerability index, which was originally proposed by Moss et al. (2001), is adjusted for the Korean context since the original version is not applicable to assess locally-focused and specific sector-oriented vulnerabilities in Korea. The conceptual framework of floods vulnerability to climate change for the Korean fundamental local governments is defined as a function of climate exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Then, statistical data on scores of proxy variables assumed to comprise climate change vulnerability for local governments are collected. The final inventory of proxy variables is determined by Delphi technique. The selected variables are standardized using the dimension index suggested by UNDP (2006). A vulnerability-resilience indicator (VRI) is calculated using Moss et al. (2001)¡- s method. Data on casualty due to extreme weather by Korea National Emergency Management Agency and VRI will be compared to verify the proposed VRI. As an application result, the effect of the four major rivers restoration project as a climate change adaptation strategy will be presented. Such a massive South Korean project to dam and dredge four major rivers has given rise to intense arguments from scientists as well as public communities. Projections of future climate information and vulnerabilities and quantitative evaluation of the effectiveness of ongoing project or counter plans for each fundamental local government would also help draw up short-to long-term adaptation strategies. © 2011 ASCE.","Climate change; Floods; Local governments; Restoration; Rivers and streams; South Korea","Adaptation strategies; Adaptive capacity; Central government; Climate change adaptation; Conceptual frameworks; Delphi technique; Extreme weather; Future climate; Local government; National emergencies; Proxy variables; Public communities; Quantitative evaluation; Restoration project; S-method; South Korea; Statistical datas; Vulnerability assessments; Vulnerability index; Vulnerability indicators; Bearings (structural); Floods; Rating; Restoration; Risk management; Rivers; Sustainable development; Water resources; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960421995

Especially, cogeneration plants produce heat and power simultaneously, which increases alternatives for operational strategies. This makes it more important for operators to determine operational strategies of cogeneration plants appropriately. In this paper, for the purpose of assisting operators or operating plants automatically, an optimal operational planning method based on the mixed-integer linear programming is developed to determine the operational strategy of equipment so as to minimize the operational cost, in consideration of equipment minimum up and down times for each piece of equipment to be operated with appropriate numbers of startups and shutdowns. In the numerical study, the proposed method is applied to the daily operational planning of a gas turbine cogeneration plant for district energy supply. It is clarified how the constraints for minimum up and down times affect the operational strategy and cost. Through the study, the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method is ascertained.

One objective of this Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) mission is to obtain global near-surface (top ∼5 cm) soil moisture every 2 to 3 days with a target accuracy of 0.04 m 3/m 3. To achieve this goal, the Microwave Imaging Radiometer with Aperture Synthesis (MIRAS) mounted on SMOS is used to observe the microwave emission from the Earth's surface at L-band (∼1.4 GHz) with a spatial resolution of ∼45 km. The soil moisture and vegetation water content are then retrieved simultaneously from fully-polarized brightness temperature observations at multiple incidence angles. However, given the coarse scale of the SMOS pixels, existence of non-soil targets (such as urban area, standing water, and surface rock) contributes to the overall microwave emission, potentially reducing the accuracy of the retrieved soil moisture. The impact of such confounding factors has not been thoroughly assessed in the context of soil moisture retrieval algorithms, since their microwave behaviours have not been well understood and/or modelled. Ignoring their contribution or simply assuming they behave like vegetated soil targets may result in an increased retrieval error. Therefore, microwave contribution of urban areas has been considered as a brightness temperature uncertainty for current generation soil moisture retrieval models that do not account for their presence. Consequently, this study has investigated the relationship between urban induced brightness temperature uncertainties and urban fraction under warm dry soil conditions, and then used this relationship to identify SMOS pixels expected to have non-negligible impacts from urban areas. An airborne dataset: the NAFE'06 (National Airborne Field Experiment 2006), and two urban extension datasets: the LUNSW (Land use: New South Wales) and the MODIS 500-m (MODIS Urban Land Cover 500-m) were used to make this assessment. The NAFE'06 was a large scale field campaign undertaken over the Murrumbidgee catchment, in southeast of Australia, in spring of 2006. A mean surface (top 5 cm) soil moisture of 0.07 m 3/m 3 and a mean surface (2.5 cm) soil temperature of 21 °C was observed during the campaign. The brightness temperature observations over the city of Wagga Wagga and surrounding natural land surfaces within the Kyeamba study area from NAFE'06 were used to establish the urban induced brightness temperature uncertainties and urban fraction. The LUNSW dataset was used to distinguish urban areas and calculate urban fraction. As expected, under dry soil conditions, urban induced brightness temperature uncertainties increased with urban fraction. To assess whether urban induced brightness temperature can be ignored, the target SMOS brightness temperature error of 4K was used as a benchmark by which to set an urban fraction threshold for constraining the brightness temperature uncertainty. A urban fraction threshold of 9 - 16% was obtained, and subsequently applied to the MODIS 500-m urban fraction map in order to identify SMOS pixels across Australia that are expected to have non-negligible urban induced brightness temperature uncertainties. The critical assumption of this method is that the microwave behaviour of the studied city is similar to that of all cities in Australia. This study suggests that approximately 0.2% (116 out of 43,323) SMOS pixels over Australia are likely to have non-negligible brightness temperature uncertainties due to urban areas under warm dry conditions.","Passive microwave; Remote sensing; Soil moisture; Urban fraction","Australia; Brightness temperatures; Current generation; Data sets; Dry condition; Dry soil conditions; Earth's surface; European Space Agency; Field campaign; Field experiment; Incidence angles; Land surface; Microwave emissions; Microwave imaging radiometer with aperture synthesis; Near-surface; New South Wales; Passive microwaves; Retrieval errors; Soil moisture and ocean salinity missions; Soil moisture measurement; Soil moisture retrievals; Soil temperature; Space-borne; Spatial resolution; Standing waters; Study areas; Surface rocks; Surface soil moisture; Urban areas; Urban fraction; Urban land cover; Vegetation water content; Catchments; Microwaves; Pixels; Radiometers; Remote sensing; Salinity measurement; Soil moisture; Uncertainty analysis; Temperature",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863419382

Thus a reliable non-contact and online detection system is essential and ultimately used to close the tip clearance control loop. This paper described a fiber optical clearance measuring system applying skewed dual optical beams to detect the traverse time of passing blades. Two beams were specially designed with an outward angle of 18 degree and the beam spot diameters are less than 100μm within 0-4mm working range to achieve high signal-to-noise and high sensitivity.

A large-scale field experiment was initiated to test the hypothesis that adding composted municipal green waste to the soil surface in an agricultural field would reduce atmospheric emissions of the 1,3-dichloropropene (1,3-D) after shank injection at a 133 kg ha-1 application rate. Three micrometeorological methods were used to obtain fumigant flux density and cumulative emission values. The volatilization rate was measured continuously for 16 d, and the daily peak volatilization rates for the three methods ranged from 12 to 24 μg m-2 s-1. The total 1,3-D mass that volatilized to the atmosphere was approximately 14 to 68 kg, or 3 to 8% of the applied active ingredient. This represents an approximately 75 to 90% reduction in the total emissions compared with other recent field, field-plot, and laboratory studies. Significant reductions in the volatilization of 1,3-D may be possible when composted municipal green waste is applied to an agricultural field. This methodology also provides a beneficial use and disposal mechanism for composted vegetative material. © 2011 by the American Society of Agronomy, Crop Science Society of America, and Soil Science Society of America.",,"1 ,3-Dichloropropene; Active Ingredients; Agricultural fields; Application rates; Atmospheric emission; Beneficial use; Emission values; Field experiment; Field scale; Flux densities; Fumigant emission; Green wastes; Laboratory studies; Micrometeorological methods; Organic materials; Soil fumigation; Soil surfaces; Total emissions; Vegetable crops; Agriculture; Fumigation; 1,3 dichloropropene; chlorine derivative; organic compound; unclassified drug; 1,3 dichloro 1 propene; 1,3-dichloro-1-propene; allyl compound; air temperature; article; atmosphere; composted municipal green waste; concentration (parameters); controlled study; field experiment; flow rate; gas; municipal solid waste; soil fumigation; volatilization; wind; chemistry; fumigation; gas chromatography; limit of detection; meteorology; methodology; soil; Allyl Compounds; Chromatography, Gas; Fumigation; Limit of Detection; Meteorology; Soil; Volatilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053073267

An appreciable dip of the circularly polarized emission (Stokes parameter V) in the middle of the microwave range (6-12 GHz), sometimes with a reversal of the sign of the polarization, is unusual. In some cases, the ordinary emission also dominates at long microwave wavelengths. Expected peculiarities of the frequency structure of microwave sources are calculated in simple models with loops in the form of hot and cool tori. Numerical calculations of these spectra show that the above features of the polarized emission can be explained by the presence of a hot region in the solar corona. It is shown that the parameters of the spectrum of the polarized emission can be used to determine the magnetic field in this hot region and the product of the relative magnetic-field gradient and the loop thickness. © 2011 Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78751549052

Global economic restructuring, rising fuel and household costs, climate change and deteriorating infrastructure all require strategies to maximize the nation's continued prosperity, opportunity and quality of life. In the face of these challenges, though, America is flying blind. No national strategy exists to build and manage the infrastructure systems needed to sustain inclusive economic growth and our competitive position in the global economy, and to secure a healthy environment for our children and grandchildren. Our global competitors are now racing ahead to build infrastructure to ensure their full participation in the twenty-first century economy. While America spends about 2.4 per cent of its gross domestic product (GDP) on infrastructure, China and India spend 9 per cent and 4.6 per cent of theirs, respectively (Congressional Budget Office 2007; Reuters India 2007; Singer 2007). Every American lives with the consequences of decades of underinvestment, including congested and deteriorating highways, unsafe bridges, inadequate transit and inter-city rail systems, delayed flights and bottlenecked seaports. Delayed shipments and the costs of congestion place every business in the country at a disadvantage compared with overseas competitors. This was not always the case. The growth of this nation is due in part to farsighted investments that built canals, railways, power generation projects, bridges and roads, and protected the nation's environmental heritage, including its forests, wetlands, coastlines, parks, drinking water and clean air. America has a history of national plans that shape development: the Gallatin Plan in 1808; Theodore Roosevelt's conservation plans in 1908; and the work of the New Deal-era National Resources Planning Board, which led to the launch of the Interstate Highway System in 1956. It's time to do it again. The Regional Plan Association's America 2050 project is dedicated to advancing a new vision for the future of America's infrastructure. Just as the Interstate Highway System provided a road map for the country's growth fifty years ago, we now need a similarly ambitious vision, but one that responds to the challenge of increased foreign competition while cutting greenhouse gases and reducing our over-reliance on imported oil. The United States continues to have great potential to compete and lead in the twenty-first century economy because of its vast human, natural and technological resources, but to do so effectively and efficiently, it must respond to four central challenges. © 2011 by Hong Kong University Press, HKU.

A shore to ship power solution is attractive for port authorities and ship owners as it helps to reduce emissions in ports by connecting ships to the port electricity grid and turn off their diesel engines while at berth to improve air quality, reduce noise and vibrations in port areas. Besides, there are also economical benefits of shore to ship power as costs related to fossil fuel consumption increase. Because most ships operate with 60 Hz electricity whereas local grid in most parts of the world is 50 Hz, shore-to-ship power is required to transfer power between two different grid systems. Although some old technologies such as rotating motor/generator systems are capable to realize frequency conversion, the static frequency converter system has obvious advantages to serve as power supply today for its small size, high reliability, low losses and low civil work requirements. In this paper, PCS 6000, a medium voltage (MV) frequency converter, is introduced. By using the proven converter technologies, the proposed shore to ship power solution can realize the frequency conversion smoothly with power range from 4 MVA to 120 MVA. In this paper, firstly, the background of shore to ship power is introduced, including the overview of shore to ship power related regulations and standards. The technologies of shore to ship power, especially frequency converter system are investigated. The components, topologies and power control methods of the proposed MV frequency converter are presented.

A set of average values of 30-years data in 8 agro-climatic indicators associated with geographical coordinates (collected from 71 weather stations in the province) was first processed using Statistical Analysis System (SAS) to develop a Trend-surface Analysis model. The resulting 8 equations would, then, produce estimated values for the indicators when supplying with geographical coordinates. Using the 8 equations with Digital Elevation Model (DEM) of Arc-GIS, the model would obtain estimated values for no data areas, i.e. integrated predicted grid values of Trend-surface with Residual (TSR), so as to form a distribution grid system of the provincial agro-climatic resources. At the end, the research introduced a fuzzy concept of agro-climatic suitability by a model which applied Fuzzy Mathematics and Factor Analysis over the indicators for assessing the agro-climatic system. The result of the model includes the agro-climatic suitability corresponding to the 8 indicators and 7 agro-climatic resources coefficients, which reveal the organic relationship between agro-climate and plant ecology. Using these models together, a series of assessments can be conducted at the grid level accuracy against a single as well as the general quantity and quality of the agro-climatic resources.

For its mid-term goal, Japan will aim to reduce its emissions by 25% by 2020, if compared to the 1990 level, consistent with what the science calls for in order to halt global warming. In order to achieve this target, the government considers CCS (Carbon dioxide Capture and Storage) as an essential method and aims to improve CCS technology to practical levels. Japan CCS Co., Ltd. (JCCS) was established in May, 2008 in order to study the potential and feasibility of CCS demonstration projects in Japan. The company was commissioned by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) in Japan. Major shareholders of JCCS include electric power companies, upstream to downstream petroleum companies, material companies, engineering companies, etc.. In 2008, an investigation of candidate sites for the CCS demonstration was done over Japan and several promising offshore sites were selected. One of the selected candidate sites is the Tomakomai offshore site in Hokkaido prefecture, located in the northern part of Japan where there are petroleum refineries, paper mills and power plants close to the site. The Yufutsu oil and gas field is located in the eastern part of Tomakomai city where much geological data has been obtained through oil and gas exploration. Basic geological modes were constructed and CO2 reservoir simulation was performed to predict the movement of the stored CO2. Simulation results show us that a sufficient volume of CO2 could be safely stored in the saline aquifers at the Tomakomai site for a demonstration period and afterward. From October to November in 2009, a 3D seismic survey was implemented to confirm the geological potential of the site. Ocean bottom cables enabled us to survey in front of the Tomakomai Port. The survey area (full-stacked area) was 3.0 km (N-S) by 2.7 km (W-E) and about 2 km from the shoreline with several target formations at a depth of about 1,100∼3,000 m. This survey was conducted in 4 patches using 2 to 3 sets of ocean bottom cables with the total number of receiver and shot lines being 10 and 26, respectively. Results of this survey were utilized in building the detailed 3D geological model for the CO2 reservoir simulation. Basic plant designing to capture CO2 at the hydrogen process in the petroleum refineries is currently ongoing. The captured CO2 will be injected at 250,000 ton/year for 4-5 years in the demonstration project. Many local organizations, such as the Tomakomai city government and the fisheries cooperative, cooperated to carry out the 3D seismic survey. The Tomakomai government has been strongly willing to invite the CCS demonstration project to the city. By their continuous cooperation is possible to carry forward the feasibility study in order to start the CO2 injection in 3-4 years. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","2 emission sources; Large scale demnstration; Takinoue; Tomakomai CCS promotion council","Aquifers; Cables; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Demonstrations; Digital storage; Electric utilities; Gas industry; Geological surveys; Geology; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Natural gas fields; Offshore gas fields; Oil fields; Petroleum prospecting; Petroleum refineries; Petroleum reservoir evaluation; Petroleum reservoirs; Seismic prospecting; Seismology; Surveys; Carbon dioxide capture and storage; Electric power company; Emission sources; Large scale demnstration; Ministry of economy , trade and industries; Oil and gas exploration; Takinoue; Tomakomai CCS promotion council; Carbon capture",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955409980

Since the filter is plugged with particles that would cause an increase of filter back-pressure, filter regeneration process is needed. However, there is not enough data on the phenomena in DPF because there are many difficulties in measurements. In this study, the flow in DPF is simulated by the lattice Boltzmann method. To focus on a real filter, the inner structure of the filter is scanned by a 3D X-ray computed tomography technique. By conducting tomography-assisted simulation, the local velocity and pressure distributions in the filter can be visualized, which is hardly obtained by measurements. Results show that, even in cold flow, the complex flow pattern is observed due to the nonuniformity of pore structure inside the filter. Based on the flow characteristics in the range of 0.2-20 m/s, simulation results show a good agreement with the empirical equation of Ergun equation. In the combustion simulation, the time-dependent temperature field inside the filter is visualized.

The RDF sample was burned on a burner with an O 2/N 2 gas mixture being supplied from the bottom. Easily vaporized metals such as mercury (Hg) and cadmium (Cd) present in the RDF flame were measured by 2D-AAS. In order to measure the atomic absorption of lead (Pb), a sub-burner supplying O 2 was placed in the RDF flame. O 2 reacts with unburned gases in the RDF flame, increasing the flame temperature locally. Consequently, atomic absorption of Pb became measurable, and its 2D profiles were obtained by mapping.

For such a calibration, a fixed-point possibly around 2000 K is desired. One requirement for application of the high-temperature blackbody fixed-point cell to remote sensor calibration is to increase the radiating source aperture diameter to a size large enough to target with a radiance comparator based on a grating monochromator. In this presentation, a fixed-point cell of Co-C eutectic (1597 K) for remote sensor calibration application is described. An enlarged 7-mm aperture design is employed for the fixed-point cell while at the same time retaining the outer dimension to fit in existing fixed-point furnaces. The observed plateaux showed temperature and repeatability comparable to conventional 3-mm aperture cells, while cavity breakages indicates the need for improved robustness in the crucible design.

In the United States it is mostly made from corn; in other countries it is often made from cane sugar. Fuel ethanol is generally blended in gasoline to reduce emissions,increase octane, and extend gasoline stocks. Recent high oil and gasoline priceshaveled to increased interest in alternatives to petroleum fuels for transportation. Further, concerns over climate change have raised interest in developing fuels with lower fuel-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions. Supporters of ethanol argue that its use can lead to lower emissions of toxic and ozone-forming pollutants, and greenhouse gases, especially if higher-level blends are used. They further argue that ethanol use displaces petroleum imports, thus promoting energy security. Ethanol's detractors argue that various federal and state policies supporting ethanol distort the market and amount to corporate welfare for corn growers and ethanol producers. Further, they argue that the energy and chemical inputs needed to turn corn into ethanol actually increase emissions and energy consumption, although most recent studies have found modest energy and emissions benefits from ethanol use relative to gasoline, depending on how the ethanol is produced. The market for fuel ethanol is heavily dependent on federal incentives and regulations. Ethanol production is encouraged by a federal tax credit of 51 cents per gallon. This incentive allows ethanol-which has historically been more expensive than conventional gasoline-to compete with gasoline and other blending components. In addition to the abovetax credit, small ethanol producers qualify for an additional production credit. It has been argued that the fuel ethanol industry could scarcely survive without these incentives. In addition to the above taxincentives, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (P.L. 109-58) established a renewable fuel standard (RFS). This RFS was expanded by the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007 (P.L. 110-140), and requires the use of 9.0 billion gallons of renewable fuels in 2008, increasing each year to 36 billion gallons in 2022. Much of this requirement will likely be met with ethanol. In addition, the bill requires that an increasing share of the mandate be met with ""advanced biofuels ""-biofuels produced from feedstocks other than corn starch. Potential ""advanced biofuels "" include domestic ethanol from cellulosic material (such as perennial grasses and municipal solid waste), ethanol from sugar cane, and diesel fuel substitutes produced from a variety of feedstocks. The United States consumed approximately 6.8 billion gallons of ethanol in 2007, mostly from corn. A sigificant supply of cellulosic ethanol is likely several years off. Some analysts believe the RFS could have serious effects on motor fuel suppliers, leading to higher fuel prices. Other issues of congressional interest include support for purer blends of ethanol as an alternative to gasoline (as opposed to a gasoline blending component), promotion of ethanol vehicles and infrastructure, and imports of ethanol from foreign countries.

We present here an analysis of two cross-European airborne campaigns carried out on 23-26 May 2001 (CAATER-1) and 2-3 October 2002 (CAATER-2) over Western Europe. The area covered during CAATER-1 and CAATER-2 was 4° W to 14° E long; 44° N to 52° N lat and 1° E to 17° E long; 46° N to 52° N lat respectively. High precision in situ CO2, CO and Radon 222 measurements were recorded. Flask samples were collected during both campaigns to cross-validate the in situ data. During CAATER-1 and CAATER-2, the mean CO2 concentration was 370.1 &amp;plusmn; 4.0 (1-&amp;sigma; standard deviation) ppm and 371.7 &amp;plusmn; 5.0 (1-&amp;sigma;) ppm respectively. A HYSPLIT back-trajectories analysis shows that during CAATER 1, northwesterly winds prevailed. In the planetary boundary layer (PBL) air masses became contaminated over Benelux and Western Germany by emissions from these highly urbanized areas, reaching about 380 ppm. Air masses passing over rural areas were depleted in CO2 because of the photosynthesis activity of the vegetation, with observations as low as 355 ppm. During CAATER-2, the back-trajectory analysis showed that air masses were distributed among the 4 sectors. Air masses were enriched in CO2 and CO over anthropogenic emission spots in Germany but also in Poland, as these countries have part of the most CO2-emitting coal-based plants in Europe. Simultaneous measurements of in situ CO2 and CO combined with back-trajectories helped us to distinguish between fossil fuel emissions and other CO2 sources. The &amp;Delta;CO/&amp;Delta;CO2 ratios (R&lt;2 Combining double low line 0.33 to 0.88, slopes Combining double low line 2.42 to 10.37), calculated for anthropogenic-influenced air masses over different countries/regions matched national inventories quite well, showing that airborne measurements can help to identify the origin of fossil fuel emissions in the PBL even when distanced by several days/hundreds of kms from their sources. We have compared airborne CO2 observations to nearby ground station measurements and thereby, confirmed that measurements taken in the lower few meters of the PBL (low-level ground stations) are representative of the local scale, while those located in the free troposphere (FT) (moutain stations) are representative of atmospheric CO2 regionally on a scale of a few hundred kilometers. Stations located several 100 km away from each other differ from a few ppm in their measurements indicating the existence of a gradient within the free troposphere. Observations at stations located on top of small mountains may match the airborne data if the sampled air comes from the FT rather than coming up from the valley. Finally, the analysis of the CO 2 vertical variability conducted on the 14 profiles recorded in each campaign shows a variability at least 5 to 8 times higher in the PBL (the 1-&amp;sigma; standard deviation associated to the CO2 mean of all profiles within the PBL is 4.0 ppm and 5.7 ppm for CAATER-1 and CAATER-2, respectively) than in the FT (within the FT, 1-&amp;sigma; is 0.5 ppm and 1.1 ppm for CAATER-1 and CAATER-2, respectively). The CO2 jump between the PBL and the FT equals 3.7 ppm for the first campaign and 0.3 ppm for the second campaign. A very striking zonal CO2 gradient of about 11 ppm was observed in the mid-PBL during CAATER-2, with higher concentrations in the west than in the east. This gradient may originate from differences in atmospheric mixing, ground emission rates or Autumn's earlier start in the west. More airborne campaigns are currently under analysis in the framework of the CARBOEUROPE-IP project to better assess the likelihood of these different hypotheses. In a companion paper (Xueref-Remy et al., 2011, Part 2), a comparison of vertical profiles from observations and several modeling frameworks was conducted for both campaigns. © 2011 Author(s).",,"air mass; airborne survey; atmospheric chemistry; carbon dioxide; carbon sink; concentration (composition); emission inventory; in situ measurement; observational method; precision; rural atmosphere; source-sink dynamics; spatial variation; temporal variation; troposphere; urban atmosphere; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960005538

The space localization of the surface states is the key effect on the electronic structures of the Co2FeAl surface. At the surface, the lattice parameter shrinks to minimize the total energy, and the minority spin gap disappears and shows a metallic band gap character. However, with the depth increasing, the lattice parameter equals to that of bulk phase, and there shows an energy gap opening at the Fermi level in the minority spin states. As a result, the spin polarization at the surface is lower than that of the bulk Co2FeAl, while it is close to that of bulk phase beneath the surface. According to the calculations, it is clear that the half-metallic property fading of the Co2FeAl films is caused by the surface states. Therefore, it is important to minimize the lattice mismatch at the interface of Co2FeAl in order to obtain a high tunneling magnetoresistance.",,"Calculations; Carbon dioxide; Electronic structure; Energy gap; Lattice constants; Lattice mismatch; Polarization; Spin polarization; Surface states; Tunnelling magnetoresistance; Gap opening; Half-metallic properties; Heusler alloys; Metallic bands; Space localization; Spin state; Total energy; Tunneling magnetoresistance; Cobalt",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79952022007

Currently, China is the world's largest municipal solid waste generator and approximate 80% of the generated waste is disposed in landfills. Landfill gas is a byproduct of anaerobic decomposition of organic waste and is typically comprised of methane and carbon dioxide. Due to the high heat value of methane, landfill gas has emerged as an easily available energy source. However, landfill gas collection is not common in most conventional landfills in China. Bioreactor technology provides an environmentally friendly way to increase landfill gas generation in a shorter period of time, which makes landfill gas collection more efficiently and economically. Model simulations were conducted to compare landfill gas generation in both conventional and bioreactor landfills and to estimate CO 2 emission reduction under various conditions in this study. The results indicate that bioreactor technology can provide a promising approach for waste management in China. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Bioreactor landfill; Landfill gas collection; Waste management","Bioconversion; Biogas; Bioreactors; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Emission control; Gas emissions; Gas generators; Gases; Land fill; Methane; Municipal solid waste; Anaerobic decomposition; Available energy; Bioreactor landfill; Emission reduction; High heat values; Landfill gas; Landfill gas emissions; Model simulation; Waste management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79961113200

A reasonable way to simulate air pollution dispersion is to modeling the dispersion and presents the results in a geographically referenced virtual environment. In this research, we apply the concept of virtual geographic environments (VGE), which is coined in the community of geographic information science, to facilitate air pollution dispersion by integrating MM5 and VGE. Because MM5 is computation intensive, the CUGrid is used in this research to decrease the computation time. Our research focuses on three key points, which are the platform design, MM5 integration and computation on CUGrid, and geographical visualization of air pollution dispersion in VGE. Based on the prototype system, a case of simulating air pollution dispersion in Pearl River Delta is employed to validate and test the rationality of the methodology. As shown in this case study, VGE can provide a good way to visualize air pollution dispersion and the CUGrid can decrease model computation time significantly. © (2011) Trans Tech Publications.","Air pollution; CUGrid; Simulation; Virtual geographic environment","Air pollution dispersion; Computation time; CUGrid; Geographic information science; Keypoints; Model computation; Pearl River delta; Platform design; Prototype system; Simulation; Virtual environments; Virtual geographic environments; Air quality; Atmospheric movements; Geographic information systems; Integration; Intelligent materials; Intelligent systems; Pollution; Research; River pollution; Virtual reality; Visualization; Dispersions",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650720062

In this study, we developed a Micro-model to forecast residential CO 2 emissions. The model outputs support decision making for appropriate CO 2 emission reduction goals. First, for Chinese urban residential buildings, we developed a CO 2 emissions forecast model for 2050 taking into account lifestyle changes and Global Warming countermeasures. Second, we used the model to estimate the CO 2 reduction potential of both residential and electrical countermeasures. Compared to the business as usual (BaU) scenario, implementation of residential countermeasures achieved 38%, 24% and 23% emissions reductions for Beijing, Shanghai and Hong Kong respectively. After combining them with the implementation of electrical countermeasures the reduction rates rose to 60%. We also compared the countermeasures to see which could bring the greatest emissions reduction. For Beijing, improvement of insulation was most efficient. For Shanghai and Hong Kong, COP increase of hot water supply appears to be the most efficient countermeasure. Through this study we were able to model global warming countermeasures for the Chinese residential sector, and found that reducing CO 2 emissions by 60% from BaU is an achievable goal.","China; Forecasting; Residential building","Binary alloys; Carbon dioxide; Decision making; Emission control; Forecasting; Gas emissions; Global warming; Housing; Water supply; Business-as-usual; China; CO2 emission reduction; Emissions reduction; Reducing co2 emissions; Residential building; Residential sectors; Urban residential buildings; Energy utilization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79956331204

Prediction performance has been demonstrated through cross validation, out-of-sample validation and isopleth validation. Sample methods and key parameters, including the maximum numbers of variables involved in statistical interpolation and training samples have been tested and selected through computational experiments. Overall impacts from individual source categories which include local/regional NOx and VOC emission sources and NOx emissions from power plants for three megacities - Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou - were evaluated using an RSM analysis of a July 2005 modeling study. NOx control appears to be beneficial for ozone reduction in the downwind areas which usually experience high ozone levels, and NOx control is likely to be more effective than anthropogenic VOC control during periods of heavy photochemical pollution. Regional NOx source categories are strong contributors to surface ozone mixing ratios in three megacities. Local NOx emission control without regional involvement may raise the risk of increasing urban ozone levels due to the VOC-limited conditions. However, local NOx control provides considerable reduction of ozone in upper layers (up to 1 km where the ozone chemistry is NOx-limited) and helps improve regional air quality in downwind areas. Stricter NOx emission control has a substantial effect on ozone reduction because of the shift from VOC-limited to NO x-limited chemistry. Therefore, NOx emission control should be significantly enhanced to reduce ozone pollution in China. © 2011 Author(s).",,"air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric plume; atmospheric pollution; emission control; experimental design; interpolation; model validation; nonlinearity; numerical model; ozone; sensitivity analysis; volatile organic compound; Beijing [China]; China; Guangdong; Guangzhou; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957939892

Emission scenarios in 2020 were projected using forecasts of energy consumption and emission control strategies based on emissions in 2005, and on recent development plans for key industries in China. We developed four emission scenarios: REF[0] (current control legislations and implementation status), PC[0] (improvement of energy efficiencies and current environmental legislation), PC[1] (improvement of energy efficiencies and better implementation of environmental legislation), and PC[2] (improvement of energy efficiencies and strict environmental legislation). Under the REF[0] scenario, the emission of SO2, NOx, VOC and NH3 will increase by 17%, 50%, 49% and 18% in 2020, while PM10 emissions will be reduced by 10% over East China, compared to that in 2005. In PC[2], sustainable energy polices will reduce SO2, NOx and PM10 emissions by 4.1 Tg, 2.6 Tg and 1.8 Tg, respectively; better implementation of current control policies will reduce SO2, NOx and PM10 emission by 2.9 Tg, 1.8 Tg, and 1.4 Tg, respectively; strict emission standards will reduce SO2, NOx and PM10 emissions by 3.2 Tg, 3.9 Tg, and 1.7 Tg, respectively. Under the PC[2] scenario, SO2 and PM10 emissions will decrease by 18% and 38%, while NO x and VOC emissions will increase by 3% and 8%, compared to that in 2005. Future air quality in China was simulated using the Community Multi-scale Air Quality Model (CMAQ). Under REF[0] emissions, compared to 2005, the surface concentrations of SO2, NO2, hourly maximum ozone in summer, PM2.5, total sulfur and nitrogen depositions will increase by 28%, 41%, 8%, 8%, 19% and 25%, respectively, over east China. Under the PC[2] emission scenario, the surface concentrations of SO2, PM2.5, total sulfur depositions will decrease by 18%, 16% and 15%, respectively, and the surface concentrations of NO2, nitrate, hourly maximum ozone in summer, total nitrogen depositions will be kept as 2005 level, over east China. The individual impacts of SO2, NOx, NH3, NMVOC and primary PM emission changes on ozone and PM2.5 concentrations have been analyzed using sensitivity analysis. The results suggest that NOx emission control need to be enhanced during the summertime to obtain both ozone and PM2.5 reduction benefits. NH3 emission controls should also be considered in order to reduce both nitrate concentration and total nitrogen deposition in the future. © 2011 Author(s).",,"air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); emission control; energy efficiency; energy policy; energy use; environmental legislation; nitrate; nitrogen oxides; ozone; particulate matter; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953680774

The evaluation focused on three areas: 1) photochemical indicator values (O3/NOy), 2) accuracy of the emission inventory, and 3) VOC reactivity. The evaluation was performed for two modeling scenarios: a standard scenario and a reduced VOC scenario, which was developed based on the comparisons of measurements with the emission inventory. Results showed that model-predicted O3/NO y ratios were closely related to VOC-NOx sensitive conditions, with transitional values similar to those identified from previous studies. Peak O3 was associated with VOC-sensitive conditions, but these were not far from the transitional regime. The standard modeling scenario over-predicted peak O3 and the O3/NOy slope, indicating an overestimation of sensitivity to NOx, probably due to too much VOC in the emission inventory. The reduced VOC scenario resulted in better agreement with measurements in terms of peak O3 as well as O3/NOy correlations. Comparisons of observed CO and VOC to NOy ratios from the morning urban samples with those from the emission inventory also supported an overestimation of VOC in the standard scenario, with CO concentrations over-predicted by about 80% and the total VOC reactivity over-predicted by 30%. The standard modeling scenario substantially overestimated the reactivity from CO. The reduced VOC scenario showed generally good agreement with observations of the relative contributions to the total VOC reactivity.

The primary control on naturally occurring CO2 in the Earth's crust results from its origin: mantle and magmatic sources, thermal decomposition of carbonate minerals, thermal maturation of organic matter, thermochemical sulfate reduction, and bacterial activity. The concentration and distribution of the generated CO2 is further controlled by the migration processes and trapping mechanisms, and eventually, buffered by mineralgas- fluid interactions. We investigated the controls on natural occurring CO2, including its concentration and distribution as a function of key geological variables, such as temperature, pressure, mineralogy, and fluid chemistry. An example from Mobile Bay (e.g., Mankiewicz et al, 2009), is compared with other field studies including Gulf Coast reservoirs (Smith and Ehrenberg, 1989) and geothermal areas from Iceland. We coupled CO2 thermodynamic modeling with the field data to describe the geological controls on CO2 occurrence, and refined a theoretical correlation for estimating CO2 concentrations in geological formations. The primary observation used for estimating CO2 volumetrics is that the partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) covaries with temperature, while the reservoir mineralogy plays a significant role in determining the pCO 2 - T correlation. This trend can be related to pH buffering associated with aluminosilicate and carbonate minerals and pore water interactions based on fundamental thermodynamic principles. The theoretical correlation matches the field data reasonably well, and should apply to a wide range of CO2 concentrations for reservoirs with constrained access to CO2 rich fluids. We applied state of the art CO2 injection reactive transport modeling (RTM) to investigate how natural occurring CO2 concentration and buffering state affect CO2 injection performance and capacity. Our RTM simulates large-scale CO2 injection into subsurface reservoirs, with the ability to capture the complex interplay of multiphase flow, capillary trapping, diffusion, convection, and chemical reactions, that may have significant impacts on both injection performance and storage security. The simulation results suggest that reservoirs with initial CO2 concentration below the buffering capacity tend to facilitate CO2 storage by increasing the structural, residual and solubility trapping. The under saturation conditions also help to avoid potential mineral precipitation and formation damage near the injection well and therefore, is a better choice for CO2 storage over reservoirs with initial CO2 exceeding the buffering capacity. We plan to investigate CO2 injections in different types of siliciclastic and carbonate reservoirs. This study expanded our fundamental understanding of CO2 occurrence, buffering and sequestration processes at multiple spatial and temporal scales in nature. The results helped us make better judgments of CO2 storage capacity and site selection that led to better design decisions from appraisal to development to monitoring. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Ccs; Gas-fluid-rock interaction; Reactive transport modeling","Atmospheric composition; Carbonate minerals; Carbonation; Decomposition; Diffusion in liquids; Digital storage; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Injection (oil wells); Minerals; Network security; Organic minerals; Process control; Site selection; Structural geology; Sulfate minerals; Transport properties; Fluid-rock interaction; Injection performance; Mineral precipitation; Partial pressure of co; Pore-water interactions; Reactive transport modeling; Spatial and temporal scale; Thermochemical sulfate reduction; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955368078

To achieve carbon neutral in earth, we must treat city as a key to reduce the urban-industrial, transportation and other industries carbon emissions, and enhance carbon sequestration from city construction materials, vegetation, carbon emissions trading and other areas, and ultimately achieve carbon-neutral in city. This is important to curb global warming. In this paper, we take Harbin for example, we chose energy consumption, respectively, and vegetation conditions as the basis to account the urban carbon footprint and carbon dioxide absorption, and predicted City carbon-neutral status by comparative analysis of two carbon-neutral city state. Finally, We took carbon-neutral measures to achieve the target of a preliminary exploration and made policy recommendations to achieve carbon-neutral in city, and provide a reference to improve the urban environment. © 2011 IEEE.","carbon footprint; carbon neutral; carbon sequestration; city","Carbon dioxide absorption; Carbon emissions; Carbon neutrals; Carbon sequestration; city; Comparative analysis; Energy activity; Global climate warming; Global sources; Urban energy; Urban environments; Vegetation condition; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Emission control; Energy utilization; Environmental impact; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Information systems; Urban transportation; Vegetation; Carbon",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861005674

Iron carbonate precipitates in an aqueous solution, when the concentrations of Fe2+ and CO 3= ions exceed the solubility limit Ksp or solubility product constant. Film properties determine CO2 corrosion rates and morphology of the attack (e.g. uniform vs. pitting corrosion). Many tests have been conducted to understand the conditions under which iron carbonate layers with protective properties are formed; the effect of various parameters in the protectiveness of such layer, etc. The vast majority of these laboratory evaluations have been performed in closed systems with limited inventory of fluids. Large amounts of iron are sometimes added intentionally into the electrolyte to induce carbonate precipitation or may be released depending on the corrosion rate, volume-to-surface ratio and testing time. In either case, the iron concentration in solution varies significantly with exposure time and may affect the kinetics of iron carbonate precipitation and its effect on corrosion rates. Therefore the applicability of constant volume tests to CO 2 corrosion prediction at field conditions, where there is continuous replenishment of fluids, can be very limited. A new approach has been developed to understand the iron carbonate precipitation and dissolution at steady state conditions in a once flow through continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) system. The new testing apparatus allows obtaining mechanistic information about the film formation and film properties through electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), linear polarization resistance (LPR) and weight loss measurements in a rotating cylinder multi-electrode system. Total iron, carbonate ion, pH, temperature and dissolved oxygen measurements are also made and aligned with corrosion rates data to understand the effect of iron carbonate film formation at steady state conditions. © 2011 by NACE International.","CO2 corrosion; Continuous stirred tank reactor system; Iron carbonate","Carbonate ions; Carbonate precipitation; Closed systems; CO2 corrosion; Constant volume tests; Continuous replenishment; Continuous stirred tank reactor; Corrosion prediction; Dissolved oxygen measurements; Exposure-time; Field conditions; Film formations; Film properties; Flowthrough; Iron carbonate; Iron carbonates; Iron concentrations; Iron-carbonate layers; Laboratory evaluation; Linear polarization resistance; Multi-electrode; Novel testing; Protective properties; Rotating cylinders; Solubility limits; Solubility product; Steady state; Steady-state condition; Testing apparatus; Testing time; Total irons; Weight loss measurements; Carbon dioxide; Carbonation; Dissolution; Dissolved oxygen; Electrochemical corrosion; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrochemical properties; Iron; pH effects; Pitting; Precipitation (chemical); Solubility; Steel testing; Surface testing; Tanks (containers); Corrosion rate",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960025606

While the SEC's guidance does not constitute a legal change, it underlines more powerfully than ever that climate change is a risk that investors cannot ignore. Institutional investors, with their broad exposure to systemic risk, should be particularly alert to the implications of this new development. Pension funds control, on average, assets equivalent to 76 percent of the GDP of their respective countries throughout the Western world.1 In 2006, U.S. pension funds held shares representing approximately one-quarter of U.S. equity markets;2 U.K. pension funds held shares representing approximately 13 percent of U.K. equity markets.3 As large shareholders, they have profound potential to influence companies in almost all industries. This chapter focuses on Anglo-American pension funds, because they are similar enough to make comparison straightforward.4 The advent of two global crises, the global financial crisis and climate change, demands an examination of the investment decisions of pension funds in the face of increasingly complex risk. Are these financial behemoths fulfilling their potential to invest in a better future? Or are they acting myopically, concentrating on quarterly financial performance while funding business in ways that have contributed to and continue to fuel these crises? At the time of writing, climate change and the global financial crisis present significant challenges to governments around the world.5 These crises are, to an extent, linked by their genesis in short-termism: in both cases, governments and industry have fostered short-term financial gain without sufficient regard to longer-term social costs of the externalities at play.6 The Stern Review highlights the central importance of environmental sustain-ability to continued economic growth: The evidence shows that ignoring climate change will eventually damage economic growth. Our actions over the coming few decades could create risks of major disruption to economic and social activity, later in this century and in the next, on a scale similar to those associated with the great wars and the economic depression of the first half of the 20th century. And it will be difficult or impossible to reverse these changes. Tackling climate change is the pro-growth strategy for the longer term, and it can be done in a way that does not cap the aspirations for growth of rich or poor countries. The earlier effective action is taken, the less costly it will be.7 As for the financial crisis, pension funds have been hit hard. The total assets of all pension funds in the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) declined by US$ 3.3 trillion (that is, nearly 20 percent) from December 2007 to October 2008.8 If private pension assets are included that figure rises to US$ 5 trillion.9 From a broad ethical point of view, it is arguable that pension funds should have a wider ambit of responsibility for promoting a sustainable future, given their financial power and their incursion into service provision once the purview of the state.10 I argue here that fiduciaries' personal ethical considerations should form a basis for individual investment decisions: the ethical viewpoints of individual trustees and asset managers are too subjective and idiosyncratic to form a proper basis for ad hoc investment decision making. On a wider scale, however, ethics can contribute to our ontological understanding of the role of pension funds. Benjamin Richardson argues that, given their financial significance, institutional investors have an obligation to use their power sustainably by investing in firms whose activities are sustainable.11 As Stern and others have argued, without environmental sustainability, the financial system ultimately cannot survive.12 The primary mandate of pension funds is the creation of financial returns for beneficiaries, but the extent to which this goal is achieved sustainably is a matter for trustees to decide. Pension funds have thus far shown some interest in advocating a change from the short-term focus of the financial system that has fueled the global financial crisis.13 However, the recent indication of interest is a far cry from action. The financial crisis has revealed that many pension funds are struggling to fulfill their primary mandate of successful financial management on behalf of beneficiaries, let alone to introduce the new variable of sustainability into their management approach.14 However, by moving toward a longer-term investment paradigm and considering climate change when designing their investment strategies, pension funds have the potential to fulfil their mandate to beneficiaries in a more sustainable manner. Reflecting on the context of climate change and the global financial crisis, this chapter sets out to demonstrate the theoretical potential of pension funds to drive the reduction of firms' climate change impact, and to expose the practical barriers that stand in their way. It examines first why fiduciary duty is perceived as a barrier to change in investment practices, outlining recent legal developments in the area. It argues that requirements of fiduciary duty have been interpreted too narrowly, and in theory should not be perceived as a legal barrier to pension funds' consideration of climate change: fiduciary duty has been flexible enough to evolve with social expectations in the past (and should be able to adapt to the increasing importance of climate change now). However, in practice, courts, commentators and trustees themselves have had the tendency to interpret fiduciary duty's requirement of prudence as what the majority of investors do. The prudent course of action in this light becomes to maintain the status quo, limiting the potential for innovation in investment strategy toward the inclusion of environmental considerations such as climate change. The uncertainty surrounding the content of fiduciary duty places a practical barrier to investment innovation in this area. Legislative clarification is needed if pension funds are to change their approach toward climate change. Moreover, the focus on fiduciary duty as a barrier to investment innovation in this area masks the behavioral biases toward inertia and short-termism in trustees, which are more insidious and at least as important. These biases, combined with the uncertainty surrounding fiduciary duty, result in a collective action problem: pension funds are unlikely to break with convention unless a significant number of them change their approach simultaneously. Under these conditions, any institutional acceptance of innovation toward a longer-term, more sustainable investment strategy that accounts for climate change will take strong leadership from pension funds themselves. It is worth noting from the outset that the arguments made here require us to put aside the dichotomy often created between the ""financial"" and the ""social."" In examining the overwhelming influence of the status quo on judicial interpretation of ""prudence,"" this chapter attempts to avoid this dichotomy. Instead, the focus here is on the ability of investors and the judiciary to adapt to new social realities; in this case the new social reality is that of environmental issues having a financial impact. At the heart of the argument presented here, therefore, social development requires a revision of what is seen as financial - in other words, the social and the financial are intertwined - and they must be. This chapter touches upon a range of important issues whose detailed examination is beyond its scope. In particular, it is not the work of this chapter to undertake an empirical analysis of the financial impact of consideration of climate change. This is occurring elsewhere, and comes in addition to the many studies on the financial performance of socially responsible investment (SRI) funds conducted in the past.15 Furthermore, it does not look in detail at the role of asset managers in managing pension fund investments; instead it explores the work of trustees in the earlier stage of creating investment strategies and in monitoring delegated functions. Finally, this chapter does not look in detail at the ethical arguments for and against pension funds' consideration of climate change. 16 Instead, the focus here remains upon, first, the extent to which, in theory, fiduciary duty presents a barrier to the potential for pension funds to contribute to a more sustainable financial system and in particular to have regard to climate change as a financial risk or opportunity, and, second, on the behavioral barriers that exist in practice.

The capacity to adapt enables societies to deal with a range of uncertainties. Coping and adaptation is a way of life in Nigeria, where climate variability is the norm and where planting cycles in a largely rain-fed agricultural system are affected by reoccurring droughts, floods and other extreme weather events. Climate change scenarios for Nigeria suggest a warmer climate and projected changes in precipitation suggest it will be wetter in the south along the coast and drier in the northeast. The climate models also suggest more extreme heat events will occur. Resource dependent people, such as farmers, hunters and fishers, who depend directly on the productivity of natural resources around them for their livelihoods, are the first to be impacted by these changes in local environmental conditions. The Government of Nigeria is a signatory to the UNFCCC and there is an initiative underway to develop a national strategy for community-based climate change adaptation. Since 2007, the Nigerian Environmental Study/Action Team (NEST) is an NGO has been implementing the project Building Nigeria’s Response to Climate Change (BNRCC). Pilot Projects are one component of BNRCC, and are designed to test adaptation options on a small scale in order to strengthen the resilience of communities to climate change, increase their adaptive capacity and provide recommendations based on lessons learned from community-based adaptation projects to the national strategy. The projects involve seven partner organizations who are working directly with 15 vulnerable communities spanning Nigeria from the Sahel in the north east to the Coastal/Rainforest in the south east.

Reefs have shown zonation in response to environmental gradients from their inception, and metazoan reefs have been differentiated into open surface and cryptic reef communities for their entire ~550-million-year history (Wood et al., 2002). Tectonics drives many aspects that control reef growth including sea level, circulation patterns, climate, and evolving seawater chemistry change over long timescales. Reefs have always been most numerous on passive continental margins at low latitudes where they typically form prograding or aggrading barriers (with growth during transgressive and highstand periods and erosion during longer low stand periods), or fringing reefs. By contrast, reef-forming toward the cratonward side of foreland basins is relatively rapid and reef geometries more aggradational. Finally, reefs forming in strike-slip basins and on thrust complexes are affected by the vagaries of local tectonic movements, which may be highly episodic but involve substantial displacements and are thus highly unpredictable (James and Wood, 2010). Climate is a major controlling force on the evolution of reefs on both short and long timescales, as the latitudinal range of carbonate-producing species is largely governed by temperature and carbonate supersaturation. Reef growth therefore shows cyclicity at all scales in response to shortterm oscillations (e.g., Milankovitch and glacial–interglacial cycles) as well as to longer-term climatic intervals, driven by slower, tectonically driven processes. Global climate has oscillated through greenhouse and icehouse phases, in concert with aragonite and calcite seas, respectively. During icehouse times of continental glaciation, high eustatic sea-level changes created aggrading reef growth, common subaerial exposure and conspicuous regional disconformities in reef complexes. These large changes in sea level caused ramps to have steep gradients, and platform tops to have significant depositional relief characterized by pinnacle reefs and erosional topography. Icehouse reefs are typically dominated by heterotrophs or autotrophs with aragonitic or high-Mg mineralogies. During greenhouse times, with little global ice, reef sequences were generated by small sea-level fluctuations. Reef cycles typically consist of very shallow-water facies, with regional-scale tidal flat caps and minor disconformities. Greenhouse reefs are often either compound or progradational as reef growth could easily match or outpace the fastest rates of sea-level rise. Ramps often have very low gradients, and platforms tend to be progradational, with minor topography. Greenhouse reefs can also have a more extensive range as carbonate settings extend into higher latitudes due to elevated global temperatures. Composition may also be more uniform, often dominated by low-Mg calcite skeletal components. Biological disturbance, that is bioturbation, boring, and excavatory predation and herbivory, has clearly escalated since the Mesozoic. Reef biotas have responded with the proliferation of traits with proven anti-predatory benefits, particularly regeneration after partial mortality. Indeed some modern dominant reef taxa, such as branching corals and coralline algae, appear not only to thrive, but actually require conditions of considerable disturbance for their survival in shallow tropical seas (Wood, 1999, 2002). Many modern reefs are largely reduced to rubble and sand via physical abrasion and bioerosion. Modern coral reefs are also dominated by branching forms due to their high diversity and abundance, propensity to proliferate via fragmentation, and resilience to taphonomic destruction. Many reefs prior to the Jurassic show the preservation of intact, in situ frameworks. Most epibenthic, soft-sediment dwelling organisms typical of Paleozoic reefs appear to have become largely absent from shallow marine tropical reef biotas during the late Paleozoic to early Mesozoic, perhaps due to intolerance of the rise of deep burrowing taxa and excavatory attack (Wood, 2010). Scleractinian corals, in particular branching taxa, show a marked increase in the proportion of forms with complex modularity from the Eocene onward, even though corals displayed the full range of morphological forms and corallite size by the Late Triassic. Highly defended, thick crusts in coralline algae become more dominant, and branching forms also become noticeably less conspicuous on reefs from the Eocene onward. This major reorganization of the coral reef ecosystem coincides with the rapid appearance and radiation of herbivorous and coral-eating reef fish, but this remain to be tested experimentally (Wood, 2002). © 2011, Springer Netherlands.

The concept of the effectiveness of such a process should be understood not only in terms of technical and economic parameters, but also environmental, due to the directives of the European Commission, continually tightening emissions limits. For example, solid fuel power units with a capacity above 500 MWth, had to reduce the nitrogen oxide emissions to 500 mg/Nm3 since 2008, which after the year 2016 is expected to be only 200 mg/Nm3. In power generation, mainly based on the combustion of coal, lignite, and co-combustion with biomass, much attention is drawn to the primary methods. It is estimated that innovative technologies based on primary methods will meet the rigours of the directives at half the costs of the catalytic reduction methods. In addition, new investments are burdened with additional costs as well as difficulties and delays in obtaining permits. Thus, in the face of this situation, relatively cheap reduction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) is an important issue, The complexity, nonlinearity of the combustion process, delays and disturbances as well as security issues makes that the nature of most discussed and implemented solutions is usually of modernization. The basic measures available to the engineer of low-emission combustion systems are limited to: reducing the combustion temperature, air re-distribution, fuel staging (combustion aero-dynamics and reburning), and the reducing properties of the rich flame. Assistive technologies like process control optimization may be complementary to these technological improvements. Controlling the combustion process is a very complex issue. The difficulty of operation of such process consists in the mutual interference effects of chemical, physical (mainly energy and mechanical) on one hand and risks existing if its course becomes unpredictable. In addition, there are restrictions on the control due to the unavailability of certain process signals (input or output) and incomplete knowledge about them. Current availability of high-speed measuring and computing devices allows to extract the hidden relationships between the elements of such complex process and the use them in control. The paper presents the technologies being developed in the Department of Electronics Lublin University of Technology. They use optical diagnostic methods, modern methods of control and artificial intelligence methods. Among optical methods, those based on image processing become particularly important. They are shown in the first part of this article. Apparent motionlessness of a flame is the result of dynamic balance between the local flame propagation speed and the speed of the incoming fuel-oxidizer mixture. Change the flame front location in space, perceived as a change in the shape of a flame, is the result of disruption of this balance. This allows to assume that the flame shape can be an indicator of the status of a combustion process taking place in certain conditions.

Two main factors have to be taken into account to explain these changes in comparison to today's potential vegetation: a generally cooler and drier climate and a lower level of atmospheric CO2. In order to assess the relative impact of climate and atmospheric CO2 changes on the global vegetation, we simulate the potential modern vegetation and the glacial vegetation with the dynamical global vegetation model ORCHIDEE, driven by outputs from the IPSL-CM4-v1 atmosphere-ocean general circulation model, under modern or glacial CO2 levels for photosynthesis. ORCHIDEE correctly reproduces the broad features of the glacial vegetation. Our modelling results support the view that the physiological effect of glacial CO2 is a key factor to explain vegetation changes during glacial times. In our simulations, the low atmospheric CO2 is the only driver of the tropical forests regression, and explains half of the response of temperate and boreal forests to glacial conditions. Our study shows that the sensitivity to CO2 changes depends on the background climate over a region, and also depends on the vegetation type, needleleaf trees being much more sensitive than broadleaf trees in our model. This difference of sensitivity leads to a dominance of broadleaf types in the remaining simulated forests, which is not supported by pollen data, but nonetheless suggests a potential impact of CO 2 on the glacial vegetation assemblages. It also modifies the competitivity between the trees and makes the amplitude of the response to CO2 dependent on the initial vegetation state. © 2012 Author(s).",,"boreal forest; broad-leaved forest; carbon dioxide; climate modeling; general circulation model; Last Glacial Maximum; paleoclimate; paleoecology; palynology; pollen; reconstruction; vegetation history",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862774192

The main natural carbon sinks are absorption of carbon dioxide by the oceans and photosynthesis by plants and algae. The main manmade sinks are landfills and carbon capture and storage proposals. Methanotrophs play a major role in the reduction of the release of methane into the atmosphere from environments such as rice paddies, landfills, bogs, and swamps where methane production is relatively high. Anaerobic oxidation of methane is a microbial process reducing the emission of methane from the ocean into the atmosphere. A complete denitrification, at which N2O is reduced to N2, is assumed to be the main elimination or sink process of N2O in the soils, besides dissolution in water.

In addition several chemical companies often store and transport large quantities of CO 2 and this may also represent a hazard. There is a need to model potential loss of containment scenarios for risk assessment and design purposes for such installations. It is observed that several models used in quantitative risk analyses and hazard assessment studies are not able to take into account modelling of the thermodynamics of CO2 in case of accidental releases from dense or supercritical conditions. Statoil together with DNV therefore initiated a project to further improve the Phast code for modelling of CO 2 releases. The work and methodology derived in this project have mainly been developed by Det Norske Veritas (DNV), but with significant co-operation and input by Statoil. The consequence modelling package Phast examines the progress of a potential incident from the initial release to the far-field dispersion including the modelling of rainout and subsequent vaporisation. The original Phast 6.54 models allow the released chemical to occur only in the vapour and liquid phases. The new Phast 6.6 models were extended to also allow for the occurrence of fluid to solid transition in case of CO2 releases. This applies both for the post-expansion state in the discharge model, as well as for the thermodynamic calculations by the dispersion model. Here it is assumed that no solid deposition occurs on the ground. The current paper documents work regarding modelling by Phast 6.6 of discharge and atmospheric dispersion of carbon dioxide, including a detailed sensitivity analysis for a wide range of scenarios (base cases) including high-pressure cold releases (liquid storage) and high-pressure supercritical releases (vapour storage) from vessels, short pipes or long pipes. The objectives of this work were to examine the effect of input parameters on key output data, to ensure robustness of the models, and to identify further model improvements where deemed to be necessary. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Atmospheric dispersion; Consequence modelling; Discharge; Thermodynamics","Atmospheric chemistry; Atmospheric movements; Atmospheric thermodynamics; Carbon capture; Chemical hazards; Digital storage; Discharge (fluid mechanics); Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Hazards; Injection (oil wells); Liquids; Offshore gas wells; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Sensitivity analysis; Supercritical fluid extraction; Thermodynamics; Atmospheric dispersion; Capture and storage technologies; Dispersion modeling; Fluid to solid transitions; Potential incidents; Quantitative risk analysis; Supercritical condition; Thermodynamic calculations; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955448953

Large multinational corporations profit from the sale of surplus credits and carbon derivatives on the international carbon market. The Clean Development Mechanism is a compliance-offset scheme established by the Kyoto Protocol and administered by the Clean Development Mechanism Executive Board. Despite the mechanism's stated objective that projects contribute to sustainable development, corporate investors pursue low-cost emission reductions while imposing a range of environmental and socioeconomic costs on developing countries. Poorly implemented projects damage local biodiversity and displace vulnerable communities. In spite of these concerns, the parties to the Kyoto Protocol are currently considering the proposal for a Clean Development Mechanism appeals procedure. The proposal, if implemented in its current form, would favor project developers by allowing them to appeal adverse decisions of the Executive Board. This Article presents an empirical critique of the Clean Development Mechanism's regulatory framework, focusing on access to information, public participation, environmental impact assessment, and access to justice. It argues for strengthened procedural requirements that would boost the mechanism's contribution to sustainable development and would enable non-governmental organizations to adequately scrutinize projects. The parties to the Kyoto Protocol should also grant local stakeholders and non-governmental organizations standing to appeal the registration of projects and the issuance of carbon credits to the impending Clean Development Mechanism Appellate Body. Without such reforms, the United Nations will continue to subsidize the destruction of biological diversity and the marginalization of the poorest communities in the developing world in the name of climate change mitigation.

Nowhere is this more keenly felt than the interface between the National Health Service (NHS) and the construction industry. Limited government investment is challenged by the ever evolving demographics and technological changes which are driving the need for flexibility and progress throughout the NHS. In tandem with these financial and evolutionary challenges, the NHS bears a legal responsibility to reduce its Carbon Footprint significantly, in line with the requirements of the Climate Change Act. Additionally, the service is driven by the organisational and legal requirements of the wider sustainability drivers. The emphasis on construction within the NHS has focused predominantly in the area of new build within the last 10 years. This paper discusses the need to focus on the area of Refurbishment. The main aim of this paper is to present a contextual basis for an ongoing research study to develop a sustainable refurbishment model for hospitals. A comprehensive literature review has been employed as the methodology to discuss the current situation relative to organisational, financial, and sustainability factors. It is demonstrated that an understanding of the nature of refurbishment is required. Challenges specific to refurbishment, such as lack of as-built data and information on the state of the existing fabric and services, may have significant effects on the project in regard to time and cost. It is further demonstrated that the hospital facility has unique characteristics and Client expectations which do not affect a 'standard' commercial refurbishment.","Climate change act; Management; NHS; Refurbishment; Sustainability","Current situation; Data and information; Economic downturn; Government investment; In-line; Legal requirements; Literature reviews; National health services; NHS; Refurbishment; Research studies; Technological change; United kingdom; Carbon footprint; Climate change; Construction industry; Management; Project management; Research; Sustainable development; Hospitals",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84861066791

Two model year 2008 diesel engines were tested with nine fuels including a certification ultra-low sulfur diesel (ULSD), local ULSD, high aromatic ULSD, low aromatic ULSD, and twenty percent blends of biodiesel derived from algae, camelina, soy, tallow, and yellow grease. Regulated emissions were measured over the heavy duty diesel transient test cycle. Measurements were also made of DPF-out particle size distribution and total particle count from a 13-mode steady state test using a fast mobility particle sizer. Test engines were a 2008 Cummins ISB and a 2008 International Maxx Force 10, both equipped with actively regenerated DPFs. Fuel consumption was roughly 2% greater over the transient test cycle for the B20 blends versus certification ULSD in both engines, consistent with the slightly lower energy content of biodiesel. Unlike studies conducted on older model engines, these engines equipped with diesel oxidation catalysts and DPFs showed small or no measurable fuel effect on the tailpipe emissions of total hydrocarbons (THC), carbon monoxide (CO) and particulate matter (PM). No differences in particle size distribution or total particle count were seen in a comparison of certification ULSD and B20 soy, with the exception of engine idling conditions where B20 produced a small reduction in the number of nucleation mode particles. In the Cummins engine, B20 prepared from algae, camelina, soy, and tallow resulted in an approximately 2.5% increase in nitrogen oxides (NOx) compared to the base fuel. The International engine demonstrated a higher degree of variability for NOx emissions, and fuel effects could not be resolved (p &gt; 0.05). The group of petroleum diesel test fuels produced a range of NOx emissions very similar to that caused by blending of biodiesel. Test cycles where an active regeneration of the DPF occurred resulted in a nearly threefold increase in NOx emissions and a 15% increase in fuel consumption. The full quantification of DPF regeneration events further complicates the accurate calculation of fuel impacts on emissions and fuel consumption. © 2011 by ASME.",,"Camelina; Cummins engine; Degree of variability; Diesel oxidation catalyst; Diesel particulate filters; Fast mobility; Fuel impact; Heavy-duty diesel; Lower energies; Model engine; Nucleation mode particles; Particulate Matter; Petroleum diesel; Regulated emissions; Small reduction; Steady state test; Tailpipe emission; Test cycles; Total hydrocarbons; Total particle counts; Transient tests; Ultra-low sulfur diesel; Algae; Aromatic compounds; Biodiesel; Blending; Carbon monoxide; Diesel fuels; Engines; Fuel economy; Fuels; Hydrocarbons; Nitrogen oxides; Particle size analysis; Sulfur; Transient analysis; Diesel engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862578787

Thus any computational model of the environment (e.g. the effect of climate change on vegetation, hydrology, landform evolution, etc) needs to include a model of bushfire (e.g. Thonicke, et al 2001). Distributed models need to not only model the temporal distribution of bushfire but also their spatial distribution. The spatial properties of bushfires include the location of the initiation point of the fire and the spread in space from that initiation point. Thus the time history of bushfire at any specific location in space is a function of the rate of bushfires in the region surrounding that point, and the likelihood that any given fire will spread to the point under consideration. Thus the fire history at a point is a function of the both the temporal and spatial properties of bushfire. In the applications contemplated in this paper we are making predictions into the future so we need to be able to make predictions in a statistical, rather than a deterministic, sense. Accordingly we are looking for a minimalist model that involves replication of the statistical properties of bushfire rather than a deterministic model that might be used for the prediction of the behavior of any individual bushfire event. Deterministic models of bushfire propagation exist (e.g. FARSITE; Finney et al, 1998) but their use for statistical prediction is limited because they require a variety of environmental inputs (e.g. humidity, wind speed, fuel load) that themselves need to be independently predicted (Pastor et al, 2003). This paper explores a simpler, purely statistical, approach where bushfire is modeled directly by monte-carlo simulation. The model is calibrated to published data for bushfire and then some preliminary assessment of its usefulness for looking at the impact of bushfire on hydrology is examined. The idea of the model presented here is that fire is modeled as a random process on a grid. Fire is randomly initiated at a time and a location, and some area around that location is then burnt. The burn history of the landscape is then the history of all of the individual fires that have been randomly generated in space and time. A spatially distributed stochastic simulation bushfire model is presented and it is calibrated to remotely sensed fire data. It is shown that the assumption of how the frequency of a fire and its subsequent extent are related has a significant impact on the net impact of bushfire on hydrology. In particular, it highlights how important it is to distinguish between how often, on average, a bushfire burns a location, and how often, on average, a location has an ignition event. These two properties are different and that climate change predictions will need to provide information on both of these properties. The fire model presented is very simple and this is its first test against field data. There are a number of areas where it might be improved to gain better fit to field data. The most obvious is a relationship between the last time a node was burnt and where fires are initiated and/or propagated. This will likely be linked to rate of recovery of biomass and thus there might be some form of climate dependency. There is also a need for more thorough testing of the spatial statistics of the model using data from other sites (e.g. Haydon et al 2000) and more comprehensive longitudinal datasets using NDVI and Landsat datasets.","Bushfire; Climate change; Hydrology; Scaling; Simulation","Bushfire; Bushfire events; Bushfires; Climate change impact; Climate change prediction; Computational model; Data sets; Deterministic models; Distributed models; Dry environment; Environmental systems; Field data; Fire history; Fire modelling; Fire models; Fuel loads; Integral part; LANDSAT; Monte Carlo Simulation; Net impact; Preliminary assessment; Scaling; Significant impacts; Simulation; Space and time; Spatial properties; Spatial statistics; Specific location; Statistical prediction; Statistical properties; Stochastic simulations; Temporal distribution; Time history; Wind speed; Climate change; Forecasting; Hydrology; Intelligent systems; Random processes; Remote sensing; Spatial distribution; Stochastic models; Uncertainty analysis; Fires",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858825908

New results are presented for a challenging city cycle; although the average power demand is low, IPC is able to keep the SCR catalyst temperature relatively high. With this IPC approach, the CO2-NOx trade-off is optimized in a systematic way.

Beside others, oxide/oxide CMC can fulfil these demands for high performance turbines due to their inherent oxidation resistance, good thermomechanical properties at elevated temperatures and low density. For some decades now EADS Innovation Works uses the filament winding technique and PIP process (Polymer Infiltration Pyrolysis) for the manufacture of a specific oxide/oxide CMC termed UMOX™. Continuous oxide based Nextel™ fibers (3M™, USA) such as Nextel™610 alumina fibers are impregnated with pre-ceramic slurries via filament winding and further processed to a green body following by high temperature treatment where the matrix is converted to a ceramic state. Besides specific advantages such as excellent reproducibility the drawback of this process is based on high manufacturing costs due to long process times and pyrolysis steps. To overcome this disadvantage and due to the strong demand for high performance materials a new process for the fabrication of an oxide/oxide CMC type, termed OXITEX™, using the tailored circular braiding technique was successfully investigated and developed. The development approach and exemplary CMC material characteristics are presented. The paper concludes with the next steps together with the demonstration of a preliminary combustor liner structure for gas turbine engine application since part of the presented work was performed within the German BMBF HiPOC program (High Performance Oxide Ceramics).

We used three exposure data sources to examine risks of preterm birth in Los Angeles women when exposed to high levels of traffic-related air pollutants - including specific toxics - during pregnancy. Methods. We identified births during 6/1/04-3/31/06 to women residing within five miles of a Southern California Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) Multiple Air Toxics Exposure Study (MATES III) monitoring station. We identified preterm cases and, using a risk set approach, matched cases to controls based on gestational age at birth. Pregnancy period exposure averages were estimated for a number of air toxics including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), source-specific PM2.5(fine particulates with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 m) based on a Chemical Mass Balance model, criteria air pollutants based on government monitoring data, and land use regression (LUR) estimates of nitric oxide (NO), nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). Associations between these metrics and odds of preterm birth were estimated using conditional logistic regression. Results: Odds of preterm birth increased 6-21% per inter-quartile range increase in entire pregnancy exposures to organic carbon (OC), elemental carbon (EC), benzene, and diesel, biomass burning and ammonium nitrate PM2.5, and 30% per inter-quartile increase in PAHs; these pollutants were positively correlated and clustered together in a factor analysis. Associations with LUR exposure metrics were weaker (3-4% per inter-quartile range increase). Conclusions: These latest analyses provide additional evidence of traffic-related air pollution's impact on preterm birth for women living in Southern California and indicate PAHs as a pollutant of concern that should be a focus of future studies. Other PAH sources besides traffic were also associated with higher odds of preterm birth, as was ammonium nitrate PM2.5, the latter suggesting potential importance of secondary pollutants. Future studies should focus on accurate modeling of both local and regional spatial and temporal distributions, and incorporation of source information. © 2011 Wilhelm et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.",,"benzene; carbon; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; nitrogen oxide; organic carbon; ammonium nitrate; carbon; nitrate; nitrogen oxide; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; air quality; atmospheric modeling; atmospheric pollution; benzene; biomass burning; birth date; chemical mass balance; diameter; diesel; health impact; health risk; nitrate; nitrogen oxides; PAH; particulate matter; pollutant source; pollution exposure; pregnancy; regression analysis; spatial distribution; temporal distribution; toxic material; traffic emission; adult; air pollutant; air quality; article; biomass; diesel engine; female; gestational age; human; major clinical study; parity; pregnancy; premature labor; priority journal; risk assessment; traffic; United States; air pollutant; birth weight; case control study; chemically induced disorder; cohort analysis; drug effect; exhaust gas; male; middle aged; newborn; particulate matter; pregnancy outcome; prematurity; regression analysis; statistical model; California; Los Angeles [California]; United States; Adult; Air Pollutants; Birth Weight; Carbon; Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Female; Gestational Age; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Logistic Models; Los Angeles; Male; Middle Aged; Nitrates; Nitrogen Oxides; Particulate Matter; Polycyclic Hydrocarbons, Aromatic; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Outcome; Premature Birth; Regression Analysis; Risk Assessment; Vehicle Emissions; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053534885

Only a few papers have examined a model involving 'flexible' operation of the capture facility in which the CO2 is captured at variable or reduced rates for all or part of a day, week, season or year. This paper presents an assessment of the operational opportunities for deploying flexible CO2 capture at black coal fired power plants located in the state of New South Wales (NSW), Australia. Different models of flexible capture including part-time operation, partial CO2 capture rates and a combination of both operating modes are examined.

Recent high-level studies by the IEA Greenhouse Gas R&amp;D Programme (IEAGHG) have estimated realistic global capacity available in depleted oil and depleted gas fields to be 130 and 65 Gt, respectively, based on mass balance considerations from hydrocarbon reserve information. However, comparable estimates for deep saline formation (DSF) storage require an analytical approach that considers the fraction of pore space in storage formations that could be occupied by injected CO2. Many regional mapping initiatives have shown that potential DSF storage capacities are typically at least an order of magnitude higher than in depleted fields. Computationally similar methodologies to estimate DSF storage resources have been developed by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Carbon Sequestration Leadership Forum (CSLF); in both, a storage coefficient, E (or efficiency factor), is used to derive resource estimates. The E coefficient takes account of various geological and technical factors that could restrict the amount of pore space available for storage but does not take into account economic, regulatory, and source-sink matching considerations. IEAGHG and DOE commissioned a study in 2008 by the Energy &amp; Environmental Research Center (EERC), to improve the accuracy of storage coefficients for DSF. As there was insufficient real-world CO2 injection data to derive a representative range for E, geological input parameters were derived from global hydrocarbon reservoir data as a proxy for DSF. Modeling allowed derivation of probabilistic ranges of storage coefficients at both sitespecific and formation levels for clastic, carbonate, and dolomite lithologies. The overall mean value of E for all lithologies was calculated as 2.6% at the formation level. A key assumption made in the study was that DSF will predominantly act as ""open"" systems, whereby pressure and displaced formation fluids can be safely dissipated through the wider storage formation and adjacent strata. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",,"Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Geology; Greenhouse gases; Hydrocarbons; Mapping; Proven reserves; Carbon sequestration; Co2 geological storages; Deep saline formations; Environmental researches; Hydrocarbon reserves; Hydrocarbon reservoir; Mass balance considerations; U.S. Department of Energy; Digital storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955367054

An important part of the project was the duty cycle tests according to SORT - Standardised on-road tests cycles (developed by the International Association of Public Transport, UITP). The duty cycle tests generated experimental data, on which this paper's discussion is based upon. The purpose of this article is to evaluate the potential of energy-efficiency improving measures on the powertrain. The ethanol hybrid bus is a series hybrid vehicle with regenerative braking. A start/stop software to avoid idling was optional. A bus with similar exterior properties, but with the ethanol internal combustion engine coupled to a conventional automatic gearbox instead of a hybrid powertrain was used as a reference throughout the project. Based on both experimental data and simulations, several measures to increase the overall energy-efficiency may be proposed. Assessed measures to increase the energy-efficiency include size optimization of powertrain components, such as energy storage and electric motor, and internal combustion engine (identified by using Sankey diagrams), adjustment of the super capacitors energy management system and utilisation of engine start/stop functionality. Analysis shows that the size of the energy storage is well attuned if applied as urban transport. It would be possible to downsize the ICE, from approximately 200 kW to approximately 150 kW, without losing substantial performance. Using the start/stop software reduces the fuel consumption with 15 % in the standardized city duty cycle but has the potential for even further fuel economy improvements in real traffic with more idling.","Energy efficiency; Energy flow analysis; Ethanol hybrid bus; Sankey diagrams; Series hybrid","Carbon dioxide; Energy management systems; Energy storage; Environmental impact; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Fuel economy; Global warming; Hybrid vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Mass transportation; Powertrains; Regenerative braking; Carbon dioxide emissions; Energy flow analysis; Hybrid bus; International Association; Powertrain components; Sankey diagram; Series hybrid vehicles; Series hybrids; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84903642241

A multiple-chamber instrumentation system was developed to rapidly and precisely measure gas emission potential from multiple sources, such as manure and biosolids, to compare gas emission reduction potential of various treatments. Up to eight steady-state flux chambers, a photoacoustic multi-gas monitor, and a hydrogen sulfide pulsed fluorescence analyzer were coupled through a multiplexer relay to measure concentrations of ammonia and hydrogen sulfide, respectively. Depending on the number of chambers used, gas concentration in the chambers was measured on 20-to 72-min intervals over a nominal 24-h period via fully-automated data collection software. Built-in quality controls allowed potential cross-contamination to be quickly identified in order to maintain the precision of the instrument. Air flow rate in each chamber was maintained at 0.5 air changes per minute using calibrated flow meters. The performance of the multiple chamber system in evaluating ammonia gas flux was tested using ammonia calibration gas (accuracy; 97.3% recovery through the system) and freestall barn-floor manure sub-samples (precision 8% for biologically heterogeneous material; standard error of 2% of mean). Using separately-collected dairy cow urine and feces the instrument system was used to evaluate impact of source depth showing an apparent slight reduction of ammonia release with increasing depth but findings were within the expected precision range of the instrument for this type of material. An example demonstrating the multiple-chamber system use in evaluating ammonia flux processes evaluated urine and feces mixed to five ratios ranging from 10:90 to 90:10. The 50:50 ratio had the highest cumulative emission over 23 h. Removing ammonia with a scrubber and moisture via condensation trap significantly improved the accuracy of hydrogen sulfide concentration measurements when analyzing dairy manure slurry. Odorous air samples were easily collected from each chamber headspace and evaluated using triangular forced-choice dynamic olfactometry and odor-quality assessments for simultaneous gas emission and odor evaluation. This instrumentation system offers repeatable, concurrent monitoring of gas and odor emission from biological sources and provides a powerful tool for gas emission research and evaluation of management practices directed at reducing gas release. © 2011 American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers.","Accuracy; Ammonia; Dairy; Depth; Design; Flux chamber; Gases; Hydrogen sulfide; Manure; Precision; Steady-state; Urine feces ratio; Validation","Accuracy; Depth; Flux chamber; Precision; Steady-state; Urine feces ratio; Validation; Ammonia; Biosolids; Body fluids; Dairies; Design; Desulfurization; Fluxes; Gas emissions; Gases; Hydrogen; Hydrogen sulfide; Instruments; Manures; Measurements; Odor control; Rating; Sulfur compounds; Sulfur determination; Quality control; Bos",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84555219902

The tropics are a key region for methane removal, with oxidation in the lower tropical troposphere dominating the global methane removal budget (Bloss et al., 2005). In tropical forested environments where biogenic VOC emissions are high and NOx concentrations are low, OH concentrations are assumed to be low due to rapid reactions with sink species such as isoprene. New, simultaneous measurements of OH concentrations and OH reactivity, k'OH, in a Borneo rainforest are reported and show much higher OH than predicted, with mean peak concentrations of ∼2.5 ×106 molecule cmg-3 (10 min average) observed around solar noon. Whilst (O1D) and humidity were high, low O3 concentrations limited the OH production from O 3 photolysis. Measured OH reactivity was very high, peaking at a diurnal average of 29.1 ±8.5 s-1, corresponding to an OH lifetime of only 34 ms. To maintain the observed OH concentration given the measured OH reactivity requires a rate of OH production approximately 10 times greater than calculated using all measured OH sources. A test of our current understanding of the chemistry within a tropical rainforest was made using a detailed zero-dimensional model to compare with measurements. The model over-predicted the observed HO2 concentrations and significantly under-predicted OH concentrations. Inclusion of an additional OH source formed as a recycled product of OH initiated isoprene oxidation improved the modelled OH agreement but only served to worsen the HO2 model/measurement agreement. To replicate levels of both OH and HO2, a process that recycles HO2 to OH is required; equivalent to the OH recycling effect of 0.74 ppbv of NO. This recycling step increases OH concentrations by 88 % at noon and has wide implications, leading to much higher predicted OH over tropical forests, with a concomitant reduction in the CH4 lifetime and increase in the rate of VOC degradation. © 2011 Author(s).",,"concentration (composition); degradation; hydroxyl radical; methane; nitrogen oxides; oxidation; photolysis; quantitative analysis; rainforest; tropical forest; troposphere; volatile organic compound",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960663054

We examined the constraints and opportunities for adaptation in water and land use planning in three regions: the Guadiana River Basin in Spain and Portugal, the Tisza River Basin in Hungary and western Inner Mongolia in China. We analysed the conditions that either facilitate or constrain adaptation in relation to (1) adaptation actors, (2) adaptation strategies, and (3) adaptation objectives. Many adaptation assessments concentrate on climate impacts and the potential of adaptation strategies. The conditions that enable people to act on adaptation are less studied. Yet these have been identified as particularly important for successfully implementing adaptation. We find that adaptation is enhanced by pilot projects that test and debate new ideas through collaboration between recognized actors from civil society, policy, and science. Promising for adaptation is the integration of (traditional) agro-environmental land use systems that regulate regional climate impacts with new technologies, organizational responsibilities and financial instruments. A key challenge is to create flexible and equitable financial instruments that facilitate benefit and burden sharing, social learning, and that support a diverse set of potentially better adapted new activities rather than compensate for climate impacts on existing activities. © 2011, Springer Berlin Heidelberg.","Adaptation assessment; China; Climate adaptation; Europe; Hungary; Land use management; Portugal; Regional water and land use planning; Spain; Water management",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84987938659

It is designed as a user friendly, interactive, model-based, and spatial-oriented information and decision support system, can be used on different spatial scales, and supports long-term and ensemble simulations on a high spatial resolution. The LandCaRe-DSS system assists strategic planning in agriculture and sustainable development of rural areas (regions) and provides answers concerning the effects and costs of possible adaptation measures.

The Strategy aims at a combination of adaptation measures and measures for climate protection, which can be effectively communicated to the public. Five fields of action that are geared towards the most important spatial factors and that are discussed by experts and other stakeholders ensure an integrated Adaptation Strategy. The fields of action ‘biodiversity’, ‘agriculture, forestry and fishery’, ‘water management and water cycle’, and ‘settlement and urban development, mobility, tourism, power generation and energy distribution’ build on one another and show a number of interactions. The fifth field of action addresses the regional measures for climate adaptation. Upon project completion in 2011, a coherent Strategy for regional development will be presented. The Strategy will also address the parameters precipitation and temperature and the indicator rise in sea level, which are influenced by Climate Change. The Strategy contains the planning direction in terms of protection of regional biodiversity, adaptation of agriculture and forestry, protection of ground- and drinking water, settlement and urban development and tourism as well as new mobility and power generation concepts. Measures for climate protection that offer development opportunities for local authorities, industry and private enterprise receive a supporting regional context.

Newer technologies such as Solvent Extraction may also require the injected medium to be heated to maximise oil recovery from the reservoir. EOR projects tend to generate the heat and power required in separate facilities, with the electricity often being supplied from a remote central generation facility. In many cases it may be possible to integrate a cogeneration plant into the EOR process. Using a single facility, a locally available fuel can provide both the power and heat required for the project, therefore optimising global energy efficiency and achieving very high overall fuel efficiencies, usually in excess of 75%, while helping to reduce the global CO2 footprint of the Oil & Gas industry. In most cases the heat produced by a Cogeneration plant is a by-product of electricity production, but it is also possible to utilise waste heat or waste gases from some processes to produce useful energy. There are numerous different ways to configure a Cogeneration plant depending on the type of fuel available and the ratio between power and heat required by the project. This paper will examine some of the different Cogeneration configurations and fuel options using Gas or Steam Turbines, or a combination of both, that could be applied to a thermal EOR project. Gas Turbine combustion can also play a significant role in the overall environmental as well as economic benefits of cogeneration in an EOR facility. The use of a wide range of fuels requiring little or no pre-treatment in a Dry Low Emissions combustion system reduces on-site energy consumption and helps reduce emissions to atmosphere of pollutants such as NOx.

Average metal temperatures of the final superheater and final reheater could run higher, at up to about 815C (1500F). Nickel-based alloy materials are thus required. Increasing the efficiency of the Rankine regenerative-reheat steam cycle to improve the economics of electric power generation and to achieve lower cost of electricity has been a long sought after goal. Efficiency improvement is also a means for reducing the emission of carbon dioxide (CO2) and the cost of capture, as well as a means to reduce fuel consumption costs. In the United States (U.S.), European Union, India, China and Japan, industry support associations and private companies working to advance steam generator design technology have established programs for materials development of nickel-based alloys needed for use above 700C (1292F). The worldwide abundance of less expensive coal has driven economic growth. The challenge is to continue to improve the efficiency of coal-fired power generation technology, representing nearly 50% of the U.S. production, while maintaining economic electric power costs with plants that have favorable electric grid system operational characteristics for turndown and rate of load change response. The technical viability of A-USC is being demonstrated in the development programs of new alloys for use in the coal-fired environment where coal ash corrosion and steamside oxidation are the primary failure mechanisms. Identification of the creep rupture properties of alloys for higher temperature service under both laboratory and actual field conditions has been undertaken in a long-term program sponsored by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Ohio Coal Development Office (OCDO). Ultimately, the economic viability of A-USC power plants is predicated on the comparable lower levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) with carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) using either oxy-combustion or post-combustion capture. Using nickel alloy components will drive the design and configuration arrangement of the steam generator relative to the plant. A-USC acceptance depends on achieving the higher functional value and lowering the perceived level of risks as this generation technology appears in a new form.

To put these changes in context, this paper starts with an overview of foreign investments in Russia from the beginning. Analyzing the source countries, we argue that round-tripping and trans-shipped FDI significantly mask the real sources. In terms of the regional distribution, high concentration is stressed. Reviewing the industrial breakdown of FDI in Russia, we point out that the fuel industry, mainly the oil production, except for 1999, has had a prominent or a leadership role only since 2003. Despite the Russian natural resource base, foreign investors are now motivated mostly by market-related factors. Before the crisis Russian macroeconomic, fiscal and debt policies improved the investment climate, while the growing state control has had a negative effect. Red tape, poor infrastructure, corruption and complex tax system remained major obstacles. Until the early 2000s, government made few steps to encourage foreign investment. Amid and after the crisis it was explicitly acknowledged at the highest level that resource based Russia needs the West, the foreign investments and knowledge for its modernization. The paper finally turns to investments from Hungary. Despite the low share of Russia in outward FDI from Hungary, there are a few significant investments of Hungarian-based investors, worth to be surveyed.",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79959784185

One such injection strategy is the reduction of the dwell time between injections to extremely low values. In general the Diesel mixture formation is governed by the geometry of injection nozzle and combustion bowl. Common rail injection systems additionally offer the possibility to inject the fuel in a train of discrete injection pulses (multiple injection). The spacing between the pulses and the individual fuel mass per pulse allow for a ""radial stratification"" of the injected fuel, and this can be used to favourably control engine emissions and combustion noise. The current work focuses on optimum injection strategies as a function of engine speed and load within the NEDC. For this, two operating points were assessed, one representing the city driving and the other one standing for the acceleration to 120 kph motorway speed. For these points especially the ""minimum dwell"", MD, injection strategies were investigated for a number of operating conditions. The low engine load and speed regime was explored at fully warmed up engine as well as for cold start and warm-up, in particular with respect to the reduction of unburnt hydro carbons, HC, and carbon monoxyde, CO. The high engine load and speed ""acceleration regime"" to 120 kph was studies for two operating provisos. One was that of purely engine internal reduction of nitrous oxides, NOx, via high EGR rates and retarded centre of combustion, HR50, the other one that of NOx reduction mainly from exhaust gas aftertreatment (DeNOx), which allows for an advance of the centre of combustion. This improves the thermodynamic efficiency to its best, but poses the challenge of high combustion noise, CN. The reduction of combustion noise can be achieved by suitable injection strategies and good results were found with MD. The MD injection strategy yielded good results throughout the engine map, compared to conventional dwell injection patterns, and it was attempted to elucidate the mechanisms causal for this advantage. © The author(s) and/or their employer(s), 2011.",,"Acoustic noise; Combustion; Diesel engines; Fuel injection; Fuels; Nitrogen oxides; Common rail fuel injection; Common rail injection system; Diesel engine emissions; Injection patterns; Mixture formation; Multiple injections; Operating condition; Thermodynamic efficiency; Fuel economy",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865582887

The DST considers both the conversion of biogas to electricity as well as upgrading the biogas to green gas and consequently injecting it into the gas grid. Based on a starting configuration - i.e. a gas grid, gas consumers connected to this grid, and biomass locations -, in combination with several building blocks - e.g. a digester installation, an upgrading plant, and a CHP installation -, the tool generates several solutions to utilize the biomass. The DST generates solutions and determines for each solution two performance criteria: CO2 emission reduction and costs. Showing these solutions, gives the DSOs insight in the available options and which trade-offs can be made. A case study has been performed for the gas grid of the Dutch municipality of Zutphen. This case study showed that cost-wise there is a preference for centralization, i.e. digesting biomass at a central location and upgrading the biogas at a central location to green gas. Furthermore, conversion of biogas to electricity led to the highest CO2 emission reduction, but also to the highest cost. Furthermore, the case study showed that the DST basically works, and that it is a good way to explore the possible investment options. The tool however needs further improvements. For instance, more performance indicators (e.g. energy usage and reliability) will be included. Furthermore, the interaction with the electricity grid will be incorporated and multiple gas qualities in the distribution grid will be introduced. Also more boundary conditions should be added to the DST, for instance taking the topology of the area into account when laying pipelines.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874214353

Based on monitoring, the runoff water quality on two underlying surface conditions was analyzed. The temporal dynamics of chemical oxygen demand (COD), NH 3- N, NO 3-N and total phosphorus (TP) were similar and the concentration dropped quickly in the first half hour. The initial concentration of COD, NH 3-N, NO 3-N and TP are worse than the fifth category of national surface water standard, some of them were even beyond the standard of the third category of emission discharge standard. In the urban water resource conservation, reuse of stormrain is a good potential. So, a simple combination of treatment methods with Quartz sand and activated carbon was proposed to reduce the pollution concentration. The COD and TP concentration decreased significantly after the treatment, and the removal rate is sensitive to the hydrological loading of inlet water. The activated carbon did not have impact on NH 3-Nand NO 3-N and the removal rate is stable on three kinds of hydrological scenarios.

Thus, environmental justice arguments based on United States carbon emissions and the disproportionate impact of rising temperatures and rising sea levels on tropical developing nations such as Vietnam frequently fall on deaf ears. This chapter explores the political and cultural construction of this deafness, seeking a better understanding of how and why so many Americans refuse to act to address global warming. The two main sources of this deafness that this chapter address are (1) the politics of carbon-intensive energy producers such as the coal and oil industries, demonstrating the ways in which those industries have distorted the debate over global warming, have found eager allies in political candidates willing to accept large campaign contributions, and—with the help of other industries such as automobile manufacturing and home construction—have encouraged the second main source of denial: (2) a culture of aggrandized individualism that places greater value on personal identity construction than on the national and global common good. Once these sources are established, the chapter recommends strategies for using narrative to overcome cultural and political resistance to climate change mitigation that may be effective not only in the United States, but in Vietnam as well. © 2011, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Climate change; Culture; Individualism; Narrative",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84890567690

The methods are extended to determine joint PDFs for rainfall and temperature, and these allow for the anticorrelations diagnosed for the pair over much of Australia. The distributions derived for the change in climate by 2070 in central New South Wales are then combined with a simple impact function for wheat, to illustrate a potential application of joint PDFs. The forced change in the crop in this idealized example has a distribution that ranges from small declines to substantial increases, largely driven by the effect of CO2 on plant growth. The anticorrelation broadens the range of impact, compared to the case where this is not allowed for. The distribution is also broadened in the decadal case, in which warmer and drier decades can produce declines in the crop. Increases are less likely in corresponding results for three southern and western wheat regions, where decreased rainfall is likely.

To reduce carbon dioxide emissions from hydrocarbon energy sources, many carbon capture methods are being explored; post-combustion carbon dioxide chemical absorption technology is the most feasible near-term solution. Since MEA absorption or chilled ammonia based carbon dioxide capture processes are energy-intensive and expensive to construct and operate, model-based design and operation of the carbon capture process is useful to reduce capital cost and energy consumption. In this work a rate-based steady-state model of an integrated MEA-based carbon dioxide capture system, consisting of an absorber and stripper, is developed using the widely-accepted commercial platform-Aspen Plus. The rate-based model has better predictive capability than the equilibrium-based model, and agrees well with experimental data from the pilot plant at the University of Texas at Austin (Zhang et al, 2009). Based on this steady-state model, comprehensive flowsheet parametric studies have been done to investigate the integrated system characteristics. The steady-state model is converted into a dynamic model in Aspen Dynamics; because of software limitations, the equilibrium reactions in Aspen Dynamics must be converted into kinetic expressions with the equivalent equilibrium behavior.

Clean-up or remediation of PHC-contaminated soils costs the Canadian economy hundreds of millions of dollars annually. In Canada, most PHC contaminated site evaluations are based on the methods developed by the Canadian Council of the Ministers of the Environment (CCME). However, the CCME method does not differentiate PHCs from BOCs, (the naturally occurring biogenic organic matter), which are co-extracted with petroleum hydrocarbons in soil samples. The CCME method can misidentify and quantify soil BOCs as regulated PHCs. Consequently, this could lead to overestimation of PHC levels in soil samples. In some cases, biogenic concentrations can cause false exceedences of the CCME Fraction 3 (C 16-C34) fine and course soil standards, which are 1300 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg respectively. Resulting false exceedences can trigger unnecessary and costly cleanup or remediation of non-contaminated soils. Therefore, it is critically important to develop new protocols to characterize and quantatively differentiate PHCs and BOCs in contaminated soils. The ultimate objective of this PERD (Program of Energy Research and Development) project is to correct the misconception that all detectable hydrocarbons should be regulated as toxic petroleum hydrocarbons. This can only be accomplished through improvements to the existing CCME PHC determination protocols and soil quality guidelines. Our goal is to provide the scientific rationale that is necessary for creating this significant degree of change. During 2008-2010, soil and plant samples were collected from over forty oilcontaminated and paired background sites. The sample collection sites included: (1) contaminated soil samples from 25-30 year old crude oil pipeline spill sites in a peatland; (2) remediated crude oil or diesel contaminated site samples; (3) tar contaminated soil sample from 30 years old distilled crude oil site; (4) diesel contaminated biopile woodchips and soil samples; (5) phytoremediation plant and soil samples; and (6) background soil and plant samples. These samples were extracted by the ALS Laboratory using the ALS Standard Method of ""The determination of petroleum hydrocarbons (C10-C50) - F2, F3, F4, and F4G in soil and water"" (modified from the CCME Tier 1 Method), and analyzed in the EST Oil Research Lab. A reliable GC-MS method in combination with the derivatization technique, developed in this lab, was used for identification, characterization and quantification of various biogenic sterols and other major biogenic compounds in these contaminated samples. Both PHCs and BHCs in these samples were quantified, and data will be used for assessment of the contamination sites and toxicity risks associated with the CCME Fraction 3 hydrocarbons. The characterization results of the first set of 21 samples indicated the following: (1) For background soil and plant samples (#1563-#1573, and #1579), the total GC-detectable hydrocarbons (without column cleanup) were determined to be in the range of 320 to 9960 μg/g or mg/kg sample (dry weight). After column cleanup, the total GC-TPH were determined to be only in the range of 60 to 1820 μg/g or mg/kg sample (dry weight). Clearly, ∼80% of the GC-detected hydrocarbons (without column cleanup) are attributed to polar natural organic compounds, which are removed by the silica gel column cleanup. These BOC compounds (often in the forms of resolved peaks and irregular small UCM humps) mainly fall in the n-C23 to n-C40+ carbon range (the CCME F3 and F4 range). (2) For contaminated soil samples (#1575-1578, and #1580-1584), the total GC- detectable hydrocarbons (without column cleanup) were determined to be in the range of 2310 to 501000 μg/g or mg/kg sample (dry weight). After column cleanup, the total GC-TPH were determined to be in the range of 2050 to 376000 μg/g or mg/kg sample (dry weight). Approximately 60% up to 100% of these GC-detected hydrocarbons (without column cleanup) are attributed to petroleum hydrocarbons, indicating that these soil samples were highly contaminated by crude oils or refined products. (3) For most background plant and soil samples, odd-carbon number nalkanes are significantly abundant than even-carbon number n-alkanes. The CPI (carbon preference index) values were determined to be very high (in the range of 7-16). This is clear indication of biogenic origins for most n-alkanes in samples. For contaminated soil samples, the total n-alkanes were determined to be in the 4.9-3606 μg/g range; and the CPI values were in the 1.0-1.5 range, which clearly indicates the dominance of petroleum n-alkanes. Loss of low molecular weight nalkanes due to weathering and biodegradation was also apparent in these soil samples. (4) The total PAH concentrations were very low in most of the background soil and plant samples (at ppb level): only trace EPA priority PAHs plus C1- naphthalenes were detected, but no other petroleum-characteristic alkylated PAH homologues were detected. Correspondingly, almost no oil-characteristic biomarker terpanes (m/z 191) and steranes (m/z 217/218) were detected in these samples. On contrast, most contaminated soil samples demonstrate very high concentrations of both total target PAHs (2835-3442847 ng/g soil) and biomarkers (16880-6180333 ng/g soil), clearly indicating contamination by oils/petroleum products. (5) Target biogenic organic compounds including target fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and sterols were detected in all samples, indicating the presence of BOCs in the total detected hydrocarbon concentrations. They were, however, much more abundant in background samples than in the contaminated soil samples. In general, the absence of petroleum-characteristic alkylated PAHs and biomarkers and the presence of abundant BOC compounds can be used as unambiguous indicators for the predominance of natural organic compounds in soil samples.",,"Biogenic compounds; Biogenic hydrocarbons; Biogenic origins; Biopiles; Contaminated sites; Contaminated soils; Contamination sites; Degree of change; Derivatization techniques; Diesel contaminated site; Dry weight; Energy research and development; Fatty alcohols; High concentration; Low molecular weight; n-Alkanes; Naturally occurring; New protocol; Oil contaminated soil; Oil hydrocarbons; Oil pipelines; Peatland; Petrogenic; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Phytoremediation; Plant samples; Ppb levels; Refined products; Sample collection; Soil and water; Soil contaminants; Soil quality; Soil sample; Standard method; Steranes; Terpanes; Total petroleum hydrocarbons; Woodchips; Air pollution control; Alcohols; Biodegradation; Biomarkers; Bioremediation; Contamination; Crude oil; Environmental Protection Agency; Extraction; Fatty acids; Lipids; Naphthalene; Paraffins; Petroleum chemistry; Petroleum refining; Petroleum research; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Silica; Silica gel; Soil pollution control; Soil surveys; Soils; Technical presentations; Soil pollution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80955172434

To overcome the economic and environmental challenges of reusing the produced fluid from polymer flooding, a combined biological/microfiltrating process with capacity of 1500 m3/day was field tested for removing oil and suspended solids. The purified water met the quality criteria proposed by Daqing oilfield for reinjection: &lt; 8 mg/l oil concentration, &lt; 3 mg/l suspended solids, and &lt; 2.0μm of median particle size of suspensions. This paper investigates the bench scale study of biodegradation of polymer-containing produced water including bacterial selection and enrichment. The enriched bacteria from local produced water pond, including Bacillus, Halomonas, and Arhodomonas, were investigated by DNA sequencing. Kinetics of biodegradation of different combination was identified and influences of additives, such as nutrient and oil suspensions, were optimized for enhancing biodegradation efficiency. According to the bench scale study, a pilot test of biodegradation/filtration for produced water purification was carried on for one year. The fully operational field demonstration suggests that the combined biological/filtratiing process can significantly reduce the hydrocarbon content and break the polymer-oil-colloid emulsions for more efficient oil/water separation.

Tianjin city plays an important role to boost the economy of North China according to the long-term development planning of China. Since a large amount of energy will be needed, the CO2 emission will be much more concerned. And it is essential for Tianjin to promote energy efficiency and reduce the CO2 emission intensity. The study explores the characteristics of the energy consumption of Tianjin city through time series analysis, and compares it with Beijing and Shanghai, which helps give some advice for the energy conservation of Tianjin city in the future. We conclude that the consumption of energy has been increasing continuously, with an annual growth rate of 8.9% during the period of 2000-2008. And Tianjin has been one of the provinces with rapidest growth of energy consumption. The total energy consumption amount has magnified by approximately 3.3 times from 1620×104 tons of SCE in 1985 to 5364×104 tons of SCE in 2008. The energy consumption per capita of Tianjin increases from 2.01 tons of SCE per capita in 1985 to 5.54 tons of SCE per capita in 2008, which is lower than that of Shanghai city and also China as a whole, while it is higher than that of Beijing. In the last ten years, the composition of energy consumption of Tinjian remained relatively steady with 2.6 percent increase for Coal, 8.8 percent decrease for oil and 2.8 percent increase of natural gas. The energy intensity of Tianjin has declined from 9.22 tons of SCE in 1985 to 0.84 tons of SCE in 2008. But it is higher than that of Shanghai and Beijing. Thus, we suggest that Tianjin should pay more attention to improve the technological progress of the industrial sectors. And the composition of energy consumption should be optimized to reduce the CO2 emission intensity. © 2011 IEEE.","Energy consumption; Tianjin city; Time series analysis","Annual growth rate; Consumption of energy; Emission intensity; Energy intensity; Industrial sector; Long-term development; North China; Per capita; Rapid development; Technological progress; Tianjin; Total energy consumption; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Energy utilization; Management science; Time series; Time series analysis; Energy efficiency",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052881499

In order to better the model accuracy, maximum light use efficiency (ε0) in MODIS-PSN is estimated using local observed carbon flux data and meteorological data. After adjustment of parameterε0, MODIS-PSN can correctly estimate GPP for major vegetation type in the Heihe River Basin. Then, yearly GPP over Heihe River Basin was estimated.

Based on the field experimental studies on conservation tillage in dryland maize cropping systems, located in Shouyang Dryland Farming Station in Shanxi province of China, impacts of different tillage systems (including conventional tillage (CT), reduced-tillage (RT), and no-till (NT) practice) on coupled energy /carbon balance were integrally studied. through field observations, embodied energy input parameter determinations, soil respiration measurements, carbon dynamic processe simulations, and energy /carbon balance estimations in dryland agro-ecosystems. Compared with CT, conservation tillage (RT and NT) could increase carbon input (about 1.6 tC -hm 2) with increasing stover return and root stubble biomass in the soils, but reduce carbon losses by stover burning /or removal (about 1.6 tC • hm 2) and by soil erosion (about 1. 2-1. 6 tC • hm 2). The energy inputs (MJ • hm 2) were in the order: CT (13829) &gt;RT(13289) &gt;NT(12434), which was similar to the order for carbon emissions (kgC-hm -2): CT(283) &gt;RT (272) &gt;NT(248). The embodied energy consumption was reduce by about 4%-12% (equivalent to 11-35 kg CO 2-Chm 2-a 1) with NT and RT practices, as compared to the CT practice. The coefficiency of energy consumption was decrease by about 6%-10% and the coefficiency of energy production increase by 7%-12% under conservation tillage systems, as compared to the CT practice. The results also showed that the rates of soil organic carbon sequestration (kg C • hm 2 a 1) tended to increase from -104 with CT to 144-149 with NT and RT. The field measurements during periods 2006-2007 showed that the mean soil respiration rates (kg CO 2-C^hm 2 a 1) with NT were generally lowest (-13%) during the fellow periods in the order: NT (540±30) &lt;CT (619±20) &lt;RT (873±137), but highest (+7%) at the peak of maize growing periods in the order: CT (1368 ±355) &lt; NT (1465±410) and RT (1468±387). The mean total rates of soil respiration (kg CO 2-C-hm -2-a -1) were RT (2342±524) &gt;NT (2005±380) &gt;CT (1987±375). The changes in maize grain yields showed the same trend with soil respiration associated with tillage practices, for instance, the mean maize grain yields (kg•hm -2-a -1) also were RT (5614±1298) &gt;NT (5533 ±631) &gt;CT (5487±1320), showing a positively close relationship between maize grain yields and soil respiration during growing stage (R 2 = 0. 88). Although different methods were used to estimate CO 2-C emissions by soil respiration processes, the analysis showed the same trends in carbon sink /source under tillage systems, such as a increasing trend in carbon sink with conservation tillage practices (generally RT &gt;NT) compared to carbon source with CT, indicating that stover incorporation combined with conservation tillage practices through increasing carbon input is an effective way for maintenance and enhancement of soil organic carbon.","Agro-ecosystem; Carbon balance; Conservation tillage; Energy balance","agricultural ecosystem; agricultural emission; belowground biomass; biomass burning; carbon balance; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; carbon sink; crop yield; dryland farming; energy balance; energy use; experimental study; field method; greenhouse gas; maize; organic carbon; parameterization; soil conservation; soil erosion; soil organic matter; soil respiration; tillage; yield response; China; Shanxi; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052443522

If the lateral size of the nanorods is small enough, it is possible to achieve a degree of lateral confinement. If the nanorods are ordered into a suitable photonic lattice, then this will reduce the lateral spontaneous emission and enhance emission along the vertical axis via the Purcell effect. Additionally there is a degree of dislocation filtering that can occur [1]. However, one potential drawback of this device is the large free surface that borders the multi-quantum well active region. Nevertheless, it has been shown that the surface recombination in the nitride materials is the lowest of all III-V semiconductors. Results of SEM, PL, EL, and far field pattern are presented to compare the progressive effect of using photo-assisted electroless and wet etching [2]. It can be seen that over time the photo-assisted electroless method clearly delineates the active MQW region, possibly as a result of the different etch rate of InGaN. Alternatively, a purely chemical etching method was used. With a narrowing of the nanorods, there is a progressive blue shift of the photoluminescence peak. The optical image of the emission shows that there are well-defined lines of enhanced light propagation that match the symmetry of the nanorod array, thus showing there is a photonic crystal effect. © 2011 SPIE.","Light emitting diode; nanoimprint; nanorods; photonic crystal","Active regions; Blue shift; Chemical etching; Dislocation filtering; Electroless; Electroless methods; Etch rates; Far-field patterns; Free surfaces; II-IV semiconductors; Lateral confinement; Lateral sizes; LED arrays; Multiquantum wells; nanoimprint; Nanorod arrays; Nitride materials; Optical image; Photoluminescence peak; Photonic lattice; Purcell effect; SEM; Surface recombinations; Vertical axis; Crystal symmetry; Dislocations (crystals); Gallium nitride; Geometrical optics; Light emitting diodes; Nanophotonics; Nanorods; Photonic crystals; Photonics; Resonant tunneling; Semiconductor quantum wells; Wet etching; Photonic devices",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955770164

Air pollutants emitted from exhaust gases of rice husk incineration lead to very important environmental damage, not only because of the influence on global environment and climate, when released into the atmosphere, but also on human health due to the local air pollution. Therefore, it is necessary to effectively utilize the rice husk waste and to reduce the air pollution. We try to develop a new-type air vortex current small-scale combustor which can effectively combust rice husk as biomass energy instead of fossil oil fuel for farming-greenhouses heating during the winter season. In this study, we investigated if rice husk can be fed on the new-type air vortex current small-scale combustor and reduced fossil fuel. The new-type small-scale combustor is able to keep a constant high temperature (about 1000°C) even if the rice husk combustion is not under the best conditions. At the same time, it is also important to evaluate the emission behavior of harmful air pollutants emitted from the rice husk combustion with measuring carbonaceous and ionic composition of suspended particulate matter (SPM) in the exhaust gases from the new-type air vortex current combustor, and to reduce the pollutant emission by controlling the combustion conditions. From the analytical results of the size distribution of carbonaceous composition collected by an air sampler, it is shown that elemental carbon dominated in the coarse particles, which are produced by incomplete combustion, and organic carbon dominated in the fine particles. Carbonaceous concentrations can be reduced substantially in the emitted particles by highly effective combustion when the combustor was improved. As the results of the ionic composition, high concentrations of potassium ion as a tracer of biomass burning were determined. Combustion temperature control is important to avoid corrosion in the system and the health effects from high concentrations of chloride contents. Although the new-type air vortex current combustor developed in our purpose is typically small-scale, however, usual fixed-bed combustors are prone to be incomplete because of the simplicity of the structure. Since there are no specific regulations for these kinds of combustors in Japan, therefore, even small combustor fall out of the possibly applicable emissions regulations, to ensure stable combustion performance and less air pollutants. In near future, we try to improve the combustor fed with less fossil oil fuel and more rice husk waste which will be feasible and sustainable. © 2012 WIT Press.","Air vortex current; Carbonaceous and ionic analysis; Combustion characteristics; Exhaust gases; Rice husk; Small-scale combustor; Suspended particulate matter (SPM)","agricultural emission; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; combustion; exhaust emission; ionic composition; pollution control; rice; suspended particulate matter; tracer; waste; Japan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865557266

To reduce air pollution, many megacities have relocated energy supplies and polluted industries to their outer regions. However, regional transport then becomes an important source of air pollution in megacities. To improve air quality before and during the 2008 Beijing Olympics, a wide range of control strategies were implemented, including the relocation of polluting industries. High sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations were occasionally observed during this period. Potential sources from southern regions of Beijing were indicated by backward trajectories model and urban/rural stationary measurements, but direct evidence was lacking. Here we used a mobile laboratory to characterize the spatial distribution and regional transport of SO 2 to Beijing during the Campaign for Air Quality Research in Beijing and the Surrounding Region (CAREBEIJING)-2008. Among the five days chosen for the case studies during the Olympic air pollution control period, four had high SO2 concentrations (6, 20 August and 3, 4 September 2008) while one had low SO2 concentration (11 September 2008). The average values of SO2 during the low SO2 concentration day were 3.9 ppb, much lower than during the high concentration days (7.8 ppb). This result implied an impact by regional transport from outside Beijing. During these days, we captured transport events of SO2 from areas south of Beijing, with a clear decrease in SO2 concentrations southeast of the 6th to 4th Ring Roads around Beijing and along the 140 km highway from Tianjin to Beijing. The influx of SO2 through the 4th to 6th Ring Roads ranged from 2.1 to 4.6 kgs-1 on 4 September and 0.2 to 1.6 kgs-1 on 20 August 2008. The differences of influx in days were due to the variations of emission changes, transport directions and dilutions. Locally emitted SO 2 from a source located along Jingshi Highway outside the southwest section of the 5th Ring Road of Beijing was identified using wind field data generated by the Weather Research and Forecasting model and the measured particle size distribution, with an estimated flux of 0.1 kgs-1 to Beijing. Estimated uncertainties for SO2 influx were approximately 31%. © Author(s) 2011.",,"air quality; atmospheric pollution; particle size; pollutant source; pollutant transport; pollution control; size distribution; spatial distribution; sulfur dioxide; urban area; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-81855191965

The growth rate can be regulated by leaf carbon: nitrogen: phosphorus (C:N:P) ratios; therefore, these ratios reflect the adaptability of plants to the external environment. Seasonal variations in leaf C:N:P ratios reflect the seasonal variations of plant growth rate. Consequently, researches on the seasonal variations in leaf C:N:P ratios can increase our understanding of plant adaptation strategies. For studies on nutrient limitation within ecosystems, a rapid and accurate method to diagnose nutrient limitation is essential. The leaf N: P ratio at a particular plant growth stage is a convenient diagnostic method to determine which element is restricting plant growth. However, the leaf N and P contents and the N:P ratio change during the plant growing season, and this can complicate identification of the restricting element. Up until now, there has been little research on the change in limiting nutrients during the plant growing season. In this study, we monitored leaf C, N, and P stoichiometry of eight typical plant species in the Yangou watershed in the loess hilly gully region. The plant species were Quercus liaotungensis, Sophora davidii, Rosa xanthina, Ostryopsis davidiana, Artemisia sacrorum, Artemisia giraldii, Robinia pseudoacacia, Hippophae rhamnoides, and Caragana microphylla. We determined leaf C, N, and P stoichiometry at different growth stages from May to October 2007, and analyzed the effects of species and seasonal factors on leaf C:N:P stoichiometry. The leaf C, N and P contents of the eight plant species ranged from 370. 2 to 566. 9 mg/g, 9. 2 to 39. 0 mg/ g, and 0.81 to 2. 35 mg/g, respectively. The leaf C/N, C/P and N/P ratios ranged from 10. 5 to 52. 9, 186. 8 to 667. 5, and 5.7 to 23. 0, respectively. The average leaf C contents and C:N and C:P ratios were markedly lower in May than in July and September, but not significantly different between July and September. The average leaf N contents were higher in May than in July and September, but not significantly different between July and September. The average leaf P contents were lower in July than in May and September, but not significantly different between May and September. The average leaf N:P ratio was lower in September than in May and July, but not significantly different between May and July. Species and seasonal factors showed significant effects on leaf N and P contents, and on C:N, C:P, and N:P ratios. In terms of leaf C contents, species had little effect but seasonal effects were significant. The results of this study indicate that (1) Hippophae rhamnoides, Rosa xanthina. and Ostryopsis davidiana adopted a defensive life history strategy; Robinia pseudoacacia, Caragana microphylla, and Sophora davidii adopted a competitive life history strategy; and Artemisia sacrorum and Artemisia giraldii adopted a life history strategy between the other two. (2) In the study area, the leaf N:P ratios clearly changed during the growth season, but the restrictive element in plant growth did not. Further research should be conducted to determine whether these trends occur over broader spatial scales and longer time scales.","Leaf C; Loess hilly and gully region; N and P stoichiometry; Seasonal variation; Yangou watershed","adaptation; carbon; environmental stress; growing season; growth rate; gully; life history; loess; nitrogen; nutrient limitation; phosphorus; seasonal variation; shrub; stoichiometry; China; Shaanxi; Yangou Basin; Artemisia; Artemisia giraldii; Artemisia gmelinii; Caragana; Caragana microphylla; Hippophae rhamnoides; Ostryopsis davidiana; Quercus wutaishanica; Robinia; Robinia pseudoacacia; Rosa xanthina; Sophora; Sophora davidii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053902942

Significant progress has been made in both areas. The disposal of CO2 has focused on making commercial use of CO2. Several enhanced oil recovery and enhanced coalbed methane projects have been implemented in China. Seventy disposal sites in 24 major sedimentary basins have been identified for CO2 disposal. The amount of spent fuel will reach about 82,000 t of heavy metal when all of the planned 58 reactors on the Chinese mainland reach the end of their lifetime. A target to build a national HLW repository in around 2050 has been set. CO2 disposal and radioactive waste disposal have much in common, but there are also many differences, including disposal principles and capacity, host media, potential sites, site characterization and cost. The site with the most potential for HLW disposal in China is the Beishan granite site in north-western Gansu Province, while most of the potential sites for CO2 disposal are in the eastern and south-western basins of China. For HLW, only one repository is planned, but for CO2 disposal, many sites are needed. The disposal of CO2 and radioactive waste are facing similar scientific and technical challenges, including site selection, monitoring of disposal site, prediction of how disposal systems will work, safety assessments, and social and economic issues. To meet these challenges, the scientists working in these fields need to intensify the exchange of information and increase cooperation. © 2011, Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","China; Geological disposal of CO2; Geological disposal of radioactive waste; High-level radioactive waste",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85052556652

It is mainly distributed in central Asia, west Asia and the Mediterranean region, especially in the basins of inland rivers of the northwest arid regions of China where it occupies the widest distribution area. The largest and most typical desert riparian forest is found along the Tarim River and occupies over 350,000 km2. P. euphratica possesses many excellent characteristics such as tolerance to cold, high temperature, drought, salt and alkali soils. It plays an active role in climatic regulation, desert extension management, river bank protection, channels stabilization and oasis conservation. It has not only protected desert fragile ecological system but also been an irreplaceable natural barrier. P. euphratica is highly prized in the Tarim Basin for its great ecological, economical and social benefits. During the growth and development of P. euphratica, the leaf morphology changes in order to adapt drought, high temperature stress in extremely arid desert region of Tarim basin. In most cases, a single adult tree commonly comprises polymorphic leaves, including lanceolate, oval and serrated broad-oval leaves. The lanceolate, oval and serrated broad-oval leaves come out in turn. In one plant with multiple types of leaf shapes at the same time, the heteromorphic leaf distribution in the canopy from top to bottom is serrated broad-oval, oval and lanceolate, respectively. In this study some standard adult plants with three typical leaf shapes were selected from the planted forest stands in Tarim basin. The purpose of the study was to measure physiological responses of P. euphratica to high temperature stress and to understand drought-resistance mechanism of this tree species under heat stress conditions. Seven temperature treatments with 25°C, 30°C, 35°C, 40°C, 45°C, 50°C and 55°C were designed to compare the responses of three heteromorphic leaves of P. euphratica including chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics and excitation energy distribution in growth chamber. The results showed that there were slight variations in F0, Fm, Fv/Fm and Fv/F0 of P. euphratica heteromorphic leaves from 25°C to 45°C. The ratio of Fv/Fm was observed to maintain 78% of normal photosynthesis reaction. Yet, a few parameters such as Fm, Fv/F0, Fv/ Fm, Fv/F′m, qP, ΦPS II, P and ETR were significantly decreased with heat stress(&gt;45°C), and the values of F0, qN and E were found to increase significantly. The level of D parameter increased at the initial stage and decreased at the later stage. The results indicate that high temperature stress decreased the activity of PS II reaction center and photochemical electron transfer rate, inhibited the heat dissipation and distribution balance of excitation energy between PS I and PS II, which led to the structural damage of photosynthetic apparatus and functional descend in photosynthetic ability. The chlorophyll fluorescence parameters of P. euphratica heteromorphic leaves varied significantly from each other in seven temperature treatments. Furthermore, the chlorophyll fluorescence level of serrated broad-oval leaf was significantly higher than that of lanceolate and oval leaf. This demonstrated that serrated broad-oval leaf had better tolerance to heat stress than other leaf types did. Finally, the membership function of fuzzy mathematics was used to analyze the tolerance abilities of three heteromorphic leaves under heat stress. The results indicates that the serrated broad-oval leaf was the most tolerant to heat stress.","Chlorophyll fluorescence characteristics; Heat-tolerance; Heteromorphic leaves; High-temperature stress; Populus euphratica Oliv","adaptive radiation; alkalinity; arid region; chlorophyll; conservation management; deciduous tree; desert; drought resistance; drought stress; economic analysis; electron; fluorescence; growth rate; high temperature; inhibition; mathematical analysis; oasis; photosynthesis; physiological response; polymorphism; population distribution; riparian forest; river bank; soil type; stabilization; China; Mediterranean Region; Populus euphratica; Salicaceae; Salix",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79957847460

Experiments showed that this heat pump water heater system had advantages such as quick starting, compact structure, no need of hot water tank, stable operation and energy saving, etc. It could be used to supply hot water above 40°C for shower or heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC). Measured data showed that during the whole year, when the temperatures of waste water and city water were 20.1∼35°C, 20.1∼30°C, respectively, it could supply hot water at volumetric flow rate of 2.5∼9.6L/min and temperature of 40.1∼51.2°C and its heating coefficient of performance (COPh) varied in the range of 3.06∼4.81.

The gas transfer coefficient of CO 2 (K CO2) is a key variable in estimating this source strength, but the scarcity of measured values in lotic systems creates a risk of incorrect flux estimates even when stream gas concentrations are well known. This study used 114 independent measurements of K CO2 from 14 stream reaches in a boreal headwater system to determine and predict spatiotemporal variability in K CO2. The K CO2 values ranged from 0.001 to 0.207 min -1 across the 14 sites. Median K CO2 for a specific site was positively correlated with the slope of the stream reach, with higher gas transfer coefficients occurring in steeper stream sections. Combining slope with a width/depth index of the stream reach explained 83% of the spatial variability in K CO2. Temporal variability was more difficult to predict and was strongly site specific. Variation in K CO2, rather than pCO 2, was the main determinant of stream CO 2 evasion. Applying published generalized gas transfer velocities produced an error of up to 100% in median instantaneous evasion rates compared to the use of actual measured K CO2 values from our field study. Using the significant relationship to local slope, the median K CO2 was predicted for 300,000 km of watercourses (ranging in stream order 1-4) in the forested landscape of boreal/nemoral Sweden. The range in modeled stream order specific median K CO2 was 0.017-0.028 min -1 and there was a clear gradient of increasing K CO2 with lower stream order. We conclude that accurate regional scale estimates of CO 2 evasion fluxes from running waters are possible, but require a good understanding of gas exchange at the water surface.

In this analysis we use lifecycle assessment, air dispersion modeling, and health risk assessment to estimate air pollution and related health impacts of the production and use of an additional 7.5 billion gallons of corn grain ethanol and 5 billion gallons of corn stover cellulosic ethanol. Specifically, we considered three potential increases in ethanol volumes associated with moving from the Renewable Fuel Standard - Phase 1 (RFS1) to Phase 2 (RFS2): (i) a 5 billion gallon increase in cellulosic (corn stover-derived) ethanol, (ii) a 7.5 billion gallon increase in corn-derived ethanol, and (iii) a combination of the two (5 billion gallons of cellulosic ethanol plus 7.5 billion gallons of corn ethanol). We use the Greenhouse Gases, Regulated Emissions and Energy Use in Transportation Model (GREET) to estimate the life cycle emissions associated with the production and use of both the ethanol fuels and an energy equivalent amount of gasoline. Temporal and spatial information was also utilized in order to allocate the lifecycle emissions as necessary for photochemical modeling. The Sparse Matrix Operator Kernel Emissions (SMOKE) model was used to calculate the base case emissions. We use the CAMx reactive photochemical air quality model to estimate the resulting changes in ozone and PM 2.5 concentrations, relative to a non-RFS scenario (i.e., relative to consuming an energy-equivalent amount of gasoline), for the entire United States using 2005 as a base year. Finally, we use BenMAP to evaluate the potential health impacts from the anticipated air quality changes. Preliminary results for February and August indicate that population-weighted ambient PM 2.5 concentration increases are up to 189% higher for RFS than for the non-RFS scenario; analogous values for nitrate PM 2.5 are 15%-150% higher for RFS. Concentration impacts vary in space and time; predicted concentrations exhibit greater spatial variability for RFS than for the non-RFS scenario. Preliminary findings from the PM 2.5 health risk assessment suggest greater impacts from RFS2 scenarios than from an energy equivalent amount of gasoline.",,,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84863416261

As most drugs exert their effect in tissue rather than blood, methodology is needed for extending pharmacokinetic analysis to different tissue compartments. In the present study,we combined, for the first time,AMS analysis with positron emission tomography (PET) in order to determine the pharmacokinetic profile of the model drug verapamil in plasma and brain of humans. In order to assess pharmacokinetic dose linearity of verapamil, data were acquired and compared after administration of an intravenous microdose and after an intravenous microdose administered concomitantly with an oral therapeutic dose. Methods: Six healthy male subjects received an intravenous microdose [0.05 mg] (period 1) and an intravenous microdose administered concomitantly with an oral therapeutic dose [80 mg] of verapamil (period 2) in a randomized, crossover, two-period study design. The intravenous dose was a mixture of (R/S)-[14C] verapamil and (R)-[11C]verapamil and the oral dose was unlabelled racaemic verapamil. Brain distribution of radioactivity was measured with PET whereas plasma pharmacokinetics of (R)- and (S)-verapamil were determined with AMS. PET data were analysed by pharmacokinetic modelling to estimate the rate constants for transfer (k2) of radioactivity across the blood-brain barrier. Results: Most pharmacokinetic parameters of (R)- and (S)-verapamil as well as parameters describing exchange of radioactivity between plasma and brain (influx rate constant [K1] = 0.030 ± 0.003 and 0.031 ± 0.005mL/ mL/min and efflux rate constant [k2] = 0.099 ± 0.006 and 0.095 ± 0.008 min-1 for period 1 and 2, respectively) were not statistically different between the two periods although there was a trend for nonlinear pharmacokinetics for the (R)-enantiomer. On the other hand, all pharmacokinetic parameters (except for the terminal elimination halflife [t 1/2]) differed significantly between the (R)± and (S)±enantiomers for both periods. The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC∞) from 0 to 24 hours (AUC24) and AUC from time zero to infinity (AUC1) were higher and the total clearance (CL), volume of distribution (Vd) and volume of distribution at steady state (Vss) were lower for the (R)± than for the (S)-enantiomer.

Box 20, Wits. 2050, South Africa","Two legacies of South Africa's past which pose significant challenges to sustainable development are; entrenched economic inequality bequeathed by the apartheid system; and the energy intensive nature of the economy based on cheap coal and natural resources for an industrial competitiveness strategy built on cheap energy. This has made South Africans to take energy for granted and neglect the most cost effective and plentiful form of new energy in the world; Energy Efficiency. Lack of a definitive legal requirement in The National building regulations has been another barrier to EE1 implementation in buildings up until now. However, Increasing electricity tariffs, the need to reduce GHG emissions, energy security & reliability issues and good public health concerns are the new drivers of the EE agenda in South Africa. The South African energy efficiency strategy calls for a mandatory regulatory regime, integrated into the National Building Regulations so that local authorities can implement it through their building control regulations. The National Energy Bill became law in October 2008. The proposed SANS 10400XA and SANS 204: Edition 1 Parts 1 - 4 will become mandatory for buildings in the next 12 months once they get promulgated. Local authorities have been readying themselves to implement the proposed new regulations by trying to align their current building control regulations application processes to the proposed law. This paper investigates practices and processes the Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality in the Greater Johannesburg has initiated to meet the above objective. Significantly, it investigates the process of re-writing building control regulations to achieve energy efficiency in building developments under municipal jurisdictions. The paper is based on documentary review and structured field interviews carried out between late 2010 and early 2011. The respondents in the field interviews were Building Controls and Approvals Officials (BCAOs) in Ekurhuleni Metro, Key Professional Practitioners (KPPs) in Johannesburg and representatives of Sustainable Construction Interest Groups (SCIGs). It highlights innovative practices and outlines possible recommendations on the applicability of energy efficiency building standards/codes through the building control process in South Africa's local authorities.","Building regulations; Buildings; Ekurhuleni Metropolitan Municipality; Energy efficiency; Local authorities",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874983647

MRI.COM well reproduced variations in the observed water temperature and pCO2sea at 1 m depth and in the air-sea CO2 flux at the buoy. Even though the analyzed magnitudes of the air-sea CO2 fluxes were of the same order, the sudden CO2 flux change occurred nearly 2 days after Tina and nearly 3 days after Winnie. The increase in pCO2sea normalized to a temperature of 29C induced by Winnie appeared longer than that induced by Tina. The numerical simulation results showed clear differences in the oceanic response between the two typhoons. In the case of Tina, upwelling along the continental shelf played a crucial role in rapidly decreasing the water temperature and transporting seawater with low pCO2 sea and high dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) to the upper ocean. In contrast, water with relatively high pCO2sea and low DIC transported by strong horizontal advection of the Kuroshio Current was vertically mixed by the passage of Winnie, resulting in a cool, deep mixed layer at the buoy. The surface seawater hydrogen ion concentration (pH) temporarily decreased during the passages of Tina and Winnie. In the case of Tina, pH decreased by at most 0.03 and for only 1 day.

Among the most important are regulating services, i.e., benefits obtained from the regulation of ecosystem processes. For example, wetlands contribute to climate regulation. Land cover can affect local temperature and precipitation, wetland ecosystems may affect greenhouse gas sequestration and emissions, or affect the timing and magnitude of runoff and flooding, for example. Wetlands also improve water quality through mechanical, physical, physico-chemical, biological and biochemical processes. These abilities are also used in constructed wetlands but within a more controlled environment. In addition, wetlands provide the supporting services necessary for the production of all other ecosystem services such as soil formation and retention, nutrient cycling, primary production or water cycling. In short, wetlands are clearly among the most valuable ecosystems on Earth. In order to provide these services, wetlands need to be properly evaluated, protected and maintained. This book provides results of the latest research in wetland science around the world. Chapters deal with such topics as the use of constructed wetlands for treatment of various types of wastewater, use of constructed wetlands in agroforestry, wetland hydrology and evapotranspiration, the effect of wetlands on landscape temperature, and chemical properties of wetland soils.

Modeling was performed to determine the air quality and public health benefits from potential greenhouse gas reduction measures for the state of Minnesota. Benefits were quantified under three policy scenarios for the years 2015 and 2025. The dispersion modeling was conducted using the CALPUFF model (version 5.8). There were reductions in morbidity and mortality from the coincidental reductions in criteria air pollutants associated with the greenhouse gas policies, and significant economic benefits. Among three policy scenarios, the Pure Cap-and-Trade case (PCT) and Platform Case with First Jurisdictional Deliverer (FJD) scenarios resulted in the highest reduction of emissions for the years 2015 and 2025, respectively, because of the more stringent requirements in terms of in-region emissions reductions from power plants. PCT and FJD scenarios showed biggest decrease in the domain-wide average of PM 2.5 concentration with respect to the reference case. The PM2.5 reductions for the PCT scenario in the year 2015 ranged from 0.01 to 0.08 μg/cu m and the same for FJD scenario ranged from 0.05 to 0.17 μg/cu m.

In addition, it also constitutes a storage method in an oil reservoir. CO2-EOR can help to reduce CO2 emissions regionally and simultaneously improve the security of energy supplies. The purpose of the present paper is: - To describe the base case simulations of continuous CO2 injection and CO2 Water-Alternating-Gas (CO2 WAG) injection in the North Sea ""conceptual"" chalk model. - To give quantitative results on EOR and CO2 storage capacity of the North Sea ""generic"" chalk model for the continuous CO2 injection and WAG-CO2 injection scenario. Base case simulations of CO2 injection have been described using the North Sea anticline sector-type model as geometry. SINTEF's oil field database was used. Then conceptual reservoir properties were calculated. Porosity and permeability were computed based on the same methods as used previously for average and standard deviation to populate the conceptual model. Finally a stochastic model based on a Probability Distribution Function of porosity and permeability was used. A conceptual ""chalk oil composition"" was derived from the Syd-Arne oil field (DK) by an oil composition change in order to match the viscosity and density of conceptual oil. A general development strategy which consists of one producer (P1) and one injector (I1) has been applied. Numerical simulation using a commercial compositional reservoir simulator was performed a Finite Difference Method. In addition, the dual permeability module was used in order to simulate fractures and matrix permeability flow. Molecular diffusion of CO2 (gas) into oil, oil into gas and CO2 into water was used. Gravity drainage, capillary forces and molecular diffusion are considered as the main factors to influence the oil recovery efficiency. Results are compared for three cases: - Water flooding, continuous CO2 injection and CO2-WAG injection: - Field Oil Production Rate and Field Oil Production Total per pore volume injected - CO2 volume stored per pore volume injected In all the reservoir model cases under investigation with CO2 continuous injection and WAG-CO2 injection, CO2 injection is found to increase the hydrocarbon recovery by 12 % to 13.2 % recovery after injection of 1.4 Hydrocarbon Pore Volume compared with a base case scenario which is water injection. After 90 years of injection, from 1.35 to 2.95 millions tonnes CO2 were stored for the WAG-CO2 and CO2 injection case respectively.

However, no consensus has been reached whether UFP transformation processes (such as deposition, coagulation, condensation) should be taken into account for appropriately modelling the dispersion of UFP number concentrations within Urban environments. Due to their confined space and the controlled conditions, traffic tunnels form the ideal environment to investigate this hypothesis. We have developed a computational model that is able to predict the UFP size-distribution at every location within the tunnel. The model consists of a number of modules that implement the most important transport and transformation processes, i.e. emissions, advection, deposition, coagulation and condensation. The novelty of the model is that it is using state-of-the-art numerical methods that allow for a high-accurate and continuous representation of the solution. We here present the results of a validation study that demonstrates that the model is able to accurately predict the evolution of the UFP sizedistribution inside a traffic tunnel.

This study provides the first published results of direct measurements of size resolved emission factors for particles in the size range 0.25-2.5 μm using a new approach to derive aerosol emission factors based on carbon dioxide (CO2) emission fluxes. Aerosol fluxes were measured over one year using the eddy covariance method at the top of a 105 m high communication tower in Stockholm, Sweden. Maximum CO2 and particle fluxes were found when the wind direction coincided with the area of densest traffic within the footprint area. Negative fluxes (uptake of CO2 and deposition of particles) coincided with periods of sampling from an urban forest area. The fluxes of CO2 were used to obtain emission factors for particles by assuming that the CO2 fluxes could be directly related to the amount of fuel burnt by vehicles in the footprint area. The estimated emission factor for the fleet mix in the measurement area was, in number 1.8 &amp;times; 10 11 particle veh-1 kmg-1 (for 0.25-2.5 μm size range). Assuming spherical particles of density 1600 kg mg-3 this corresponds to 27.5 mg veh-1 kmg-1. For particles (0.8-2.5 μm) the emission factors were 5.1 109 veh-1 km -1 for number and 11.5 mg veh-1 kmg-1 for mass. But a wind speed dependence was noted for high wind speeds. Thus, for wind speeds larger than 9 m sg-1, as measured in the tower at 105 m (105), the emission factor for particle number and mass was parameterised as: f (Number, 0.8-2.5 μm) Combining double low line (6.1 ± 1.7)109 U 105 &amp;minus;50 &amp;plusmn; 188 and Ef (Mass, 0.8μndash;2.5 μm) Combining double low line (20 μ 12) 105 ± 171 ±122. © 2011 Author(s).",,"aerosol; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; eddy covariance; emission inventory; particle size; size distribution; traffic emission; uncertainty analysis; urban atmosphere; wind velocity; Stockholm [Stockholm (CNT)]; Stockholm [Sweden]; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79958164246

Trees in paved impervious areas often suffer from a poor root zone environment. The objective of this experiment was to test if use of pervious concrete could be more beneficial for root growth and consequently a better alternative towards preserving existing mature trees during urban development. We measured root activity through CO2 flux, and also measured root production of American sweetgum under impervious concrete, pervious concrete and no pavement conditions (control). Soil under impervious concrete had lower oxygen concentrations than soil under pervious concrete and control treatments, particularly under wet conditions. Soil under pervious concrete had a 0.020m3m-3 (2% volumetric water content (VWC)) greater volumetric water content than soils paved with impervious concrete. Soil CO2 efflux rates and soil CO2 concentrations were extremely high under both concrete treatments. Standing live root length at the end of the experiment was greater under the control treatment than under both concrete treatments and these changes in root production were likely due to high soil CO2 concentrations under both pervious and impervious concrete. The soil type at our site, which is a Ships clay with a very low permeability rate, may have limited CO2 exchange through the pervious pavement. On this heavy clay soil, pervious concrete did not convey any measurable root growth benefits over impervious concrete. © 2011 Published by Elsevier GmbH.","Rhizosphere; Soil chemistry; Soil CO2 efflux; Soil respiration; Urban pavement","absorption; canopy; carbon dioxide; clay soil; concrete; dicotyledon; growth rate; pavement; permeability; rhizosphere; runoff; soil carbon; soil chemistry; soil emission; soil respiration; soil type; urban development; water content; Liquidambar; Liquidambar styraciflua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79953307221

As long as the price of renewable energy is still not competitive with fossil energy, the energy saving goals can only be reached supported by severe governmental policies. In Europe the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive is a driving force for member states to develop and strengthen energy performance regulations for new buildings and energy certificates for the building stock. The goals are to build net zero energy buildings in 2020 and to reach a neutral energy situation in the whole stock by 2050. Research delivers signals that, although technically feasible, actual results of the policies and regulations are not as expected. Theoretical energy use calculated on base of the design standard for newly built houses and assessment standards for energy certificates of existing dwellings differ largely from the measured actual energy use. The potential of the existing building stock is even higher, but harder to harvest. The paper will present findings of several research projects providing evidence of malfunctioning of current approaches. Based on this, the paper will present some ideas of innovations in the regulatory and control systems and suggestions for research to support alternative solutions.","Building control; Building regulations; Energy performance; Energy saving",,Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84874974026

In this manner, the flow, the temperature, and the distribution of species concentrations may be controlled.

However, very limited information is available on the morphology and phase state of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) particles. The physical state of particles greatly affects particulate-phase chemical reactions, and thus the growth rates of newly formed atmospheric aerosol. Thus verifying the physical phase state of SOA particles gives new and important insight into their formation, subsequent growth, and consequently potential atmospheric impacts. According to our recent study, biogenic SOA particles produced in laboratory chambers from the oxidation of real plant emissions as well as in ambient boreal forest atmospheres can exist in a solid phase in size range >30 nm. In this paper, we extend previously published results to diameters in the range of 17ĝ€""30 nm. The physical phase of the particles is studied by investigating particle bounce properties utilizing electrical low pressure impactor (ELPI). We also investigate the effect of estimates of particle density on the interpretation of our bounce observations. According to the results presented in this paper, particle bounce clearly decreases with decreasing particle size in sub 30 nm size range. The comparison measurements by ammonium sulphate and investigation of the particle impaction velocities strongly suggest that the decreasing bounce is caused by the differences in composition and phase of large (diameters greater than 30 nm) and smaller (diameters between 17 and 30 nm) particles. © 2011 Author(s).",,"aerosol; chemical composition; climate effect; morphology; particle size; reaction kinetics; size distribution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80052234459

External co-investment-e.g., through incentives from programs to reduce emissions from deforestation and degradation (REDD) and eco-certification-needs to synergize with local efforts by understanding local dynamics and conditions for free and prior informed consent. We assessed the perceptions and behavior of rubber agroforest farmers under existing conservation agreements as a step toward institutionalized reward schemes for agro-biodiversity using questionnaires and role-playing games (RPG). To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to apply such a combination of methods to explore the perceptions of payments for environmental services (PES). Results revealed a strong conservation belief system and social norms in the research site, with indications that individual interest in converting old rubber agroforest to oil palm, with consequent private gain and loss of local social agro-biodiversity benefits, is suppressed in the social context of a role-playing game. In the game, all financial bids by external agents to secure an oil palm foothold in the village, were rejected despite indications of declining income in the village.

With availability of the ice-free seaport of Klaipėda, a well-developed road infrastructure and a broad railway gauge, the country enjoys competitive advantages in the development of transit functions of road and railway transport. Nevertheless, the Strategy of Distribution Network cannot be built on the basis of economic benefit alone, it is vital to take into consideration the global transport problems, such as extensive load on the road network and the subsequent negative environmental effects. The article provides an analysis of the transportation of automobiles via the territory of the Republic of Lithuania in 2007-2009. In accordance to the results of the analysis, the article views the transportation of automobiles via Lithuania's territory as a separate transport system. For this purpose, the article identifies the main components of the automobile haulage system, methods and the factors that influence the intensity of transportation. A conclusion is drawn that the automobile haulage system features system marginal measures. Among the key marginal measures are system capacity, and exceeding the capacity would lead to negative effects upon the condition of the transport infrastructure and economic indicators. With the help of methods of simulation of cargo haulage and air pollution, an automobile carriage scheme with the lowest environmental effects is established. © Vilnius Gediminas Technical University, 2011.","Automobiles; Cargo flow; Ecological loss; Economic value; Haulage; Road and rail transport; Route","Automobiles; Competition; Economics; Railroads; Rails; Roads and streets; Transportation; Cargo flow; Ecological loss; Economic values; Haulage; Rail transport; Route; Freight transportation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84893237201

The large amounts of supercritical CO2 that need to be injected into deep saline aquifers may cause large fluid pressure buildup. The resulting overpressure will produce changes in the effective stress field. This will deform the rock and may promote reactivation of sealed fractures or the creation of new ones in the caprock seal, which could lead to escape paths for CO2. To understand these coupled hydromechanical phenomena, we model an axisymmetric horizontal aquifer-caprock system. We study plastic strain propagation patterns using a viscoplastic approach. Simulations illustrate that plastic strain may propagate through the whole thickness of the caprock if horizontal stress is lower than vertical stress. In contrast, plastic strain concentrates in the contact between the aquifer and the caprock if horizontal stress is larger than vertical stress. Aquifers that present a low-permeability boundary experience an additional fluid pressure increase once the pressure buildup cone reaches the outer boundary. However, fluid pressure does not evolve uniformly in the aquifer. While it increases in the low-permeability boundary, it drops in the vicinity of the injection well because of the lower viscosity of CO2. Thus, caprock stability does not get worse in semi-closed aquifers compared to open aquifers. Overall, the caprock acts as a plate that bends because of pressure buildup, producing a horizontal extension of the upper part of the caprock. This implies a vertical compression of this zone, which may produce settlements instead of uplift in low-permeability (κ≤10-18 m2) caprocks at early times of injection. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Dilatancy; Fracture; Hydromechanical coupling; Pressure buildup; Stress state","Aquifers; Carbon; Fracture; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogeology; Injection (oil wells); Plastic deformation; Coupled hydro mechanicals; Deep saline aquifers; Dilatancy; Effective stress field; Geomechanical stability; Hydromechanical coupling; Pressure build up; Stress state; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955376982

The electric power sectors in China and India is dominated by coal-fired power plants, whereas fuel oil and natural gas are the key fossil fuels in Mexico. Spurred by economic development and population growth, demand for electricity in these countries is expected to continue to rise. Meeting this increased demand will have a significant impact on emissions of greenhouse gases (GHG). While available portfolio of generation and mitigation technologies may not suffice to arrest the growth of emissions, it can help reduce the rate of emissions growth. To achieve significant reductions, multiple approaches are required, such as reducing demand by adopting end-use efficiency improvement measures, accelerating the deployment of renewable and nuclear power, and adopting cleaner more efficient generation technologies. Retrofitting the existing fleet to meet strengthened environmental standards, and accelerated fleet-turnover, coupled with adoption of state-of-the-art high efficiency generation technologies, such as supercritical and ultra-supercritical boilers and advanced combined-cycle gas turbines, should play an important role in meeting the increasing demand with the least amount of GHG emissions. In parallel, significant R&amp;D efforts will have to be undertaken to adapt off-the-shelf generation technologies to suit local needs.

The contaminants in the purified CO2 stream depend on the type of power plant and the capture scheme. For on oxyfuel based combustion cycle, we have previously evaluated the effect of presence of oxygen, nitrogen and argon on the CO2 phase diagram and the critical properties of mixtures in these systems [1]. For a 320 km pipeline, we established a base case for pure CO2, and evaluated the difference in compressor power requirements as each contaminant was added in fixed proportions [1]. The key finding was that if the mixture encountered a two-phase region along the pipeline, the pressure drop becomes punitive. We proposed a minimal adjustment of operating conditions (or the temperature and pressure profile along the pipeline) to avoid the two-phase region and concomitant prohibitive pressure losses. In this paper, we consider the influence of hydrogen sulfide and water on the phase behavior of the CO 2-rich captured stream. Specifically, we examine the phase equilibria and the PVT properties, and compare the GERG-2008 equation of state (EoS) computations with experimental data. In general, CO2-rich effluent mixtures from oxy-fuel plants may undergo phase separation at higher pressures than that for pure CO2 for the temperature range likely to be encountered in surface and injection facilities designed for CO2 sequestration. In addition, density, compressibility, and reactive properties of these mixtures may be significantly different from pure CO2. Consequently, operation of large geologic CO2 storage sites must anticipate how these differences in the thermodynamic properties of the injected fluids may affect compressor power requirements, pipeline transport, well design, and wellbore and reservoir integrity. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Pipeline; Pressure drop","Carbon; Digital storage; Drops; Effluents; Equations of state; Greenhouse gases; Impurities; Mixtures; Phase equilibria; Phase separation; Pipelines; Pressure drop; Thermodynamic properties; Transport properties; Combustion cycle; Critical properties; Equation of state; Operating condition; Pipeline transport; Reactive property; Temperature and pressures; Temperature range; Carbon dioxide",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79955384127

As part of the EU's commitment, the UK has set itself to an ambitious target of achieving 15% reduction (relative to the 1990 level) in carbon emissions by the year 2020. By 2050, this carbon reduction target is set to reach the 60% level. In achieving this, UK has chosen wind generation as the alternative green energy source. Many number of off-shore and on-shore wind farms are already in construction and more are planned across different parts of UK (onshore and offshore). To accommodate this new generation, it will be necessary to both build local connection assets and to reinforce the main power system infrastructure. Under the recently introduced Connect and Manage regime, generation can connect to the system ahead of any required deeper reinforcement; once its local connection is complete. This leads to significant generation constraints, and has led National Grid to investigate the potential for utilising technologies like dynamic overhead line ratings in minimising the constraint cost due to the imposed connect and manage regime. Control tools such as operational tripping schemes, while used in conjunction with dynamic line rating can better utilise the existing assets. This potential technique in minimising the constraint cost has been explored in this paper under different possible wind power connected scenarios. To understand and realise the potential of these technologies, along with issues on their use, a development project has been established. Humber Estuary is selected as key region in the UK, already congested with existing generators and planned to connect a significant volume of new offshore wind farms in the future. Hence, there is potential for utilising control tools such as dynamic thermal rating and operational tripping schemes in the area through minimising constraints whilst managing the system. This paper will provide a detailed overview of the network in this region - highlighting the importance of overcoming the network congestion. An overview of dynamic thermal rating technology will be presented and load flow analysis to indicate how the power flow patterns could change in the post wind-power connected scenario. Three potential wind-farm connection substations have been identified, and the wind-connected scenarios by taking account of the all possible single (N-1) and double (N-D) circuit outage constraints are analysed in detail. These analyses identify load flow factors to be monitored in the post wind-connected scenario. Also, it identifies key congested transmission lines in the region, which will benefit most from the potential of dynamic thermal rating in overcoming the constraints due to the increased power flow. The possible rating ranges achievable on the overhead lines, which are associated with a number of dynamic thermal rating techniques, are identified. A new enhanced scheme is proposed for the coordinated use of operational tripping schemes and dynamic thermal rating to manage the increased power flow. Use of this co-ordinated technique highlights a potential solution by managing the problems of increased power flows, prior to system reinforcement. This is clearly the case as long as the potential for each key transmission line has been thoroughly investigated. The impact on the overall network performance when the DLR is introduced, has also been discussed.","Connect and manage regime; Constraint cost and wind farm connection; Dynamic thermal rating; Operational tripping schemes","Connect and manage regime; Dynamic line ratings; Dynamic thermal ratings; Green energy sources; Operational tripping schemes; Overhead line rating; Potential techniques; Wind farm; Alternative fuels; Costs; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Grid computing; Network performance; Offshore wind farms; Overhead lines; Reinforcement; Transmission line theory; Rating",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84877248738

Turtles are excellent models for the study of developmental instability because anomalies are easily detected in the form of malformations, additions, or reductions in the number of scutes or scales. Methodology/Principal Findings: In this study, we integrated field observations, manipulative experiments, and climatic and genetic approaches to investigate the origin of carapace scute anomalies across Iberian populations of the European pond turtle, Emys orbicularis. The proportion of anomalous individuals varied from 3% to 69% in local populations, with increasing frequency of anomalies in northern regions. We found no significant effect of climatic and soil moisture, or climatic temperature on the occurrence of anomalies. However, lower genetic diversity and inbreeding were good predictors of the prevalence of scute anomalies among populations. Both decreasing genetic diversity and increasing proportion of anomalous individuals in northern parts of the Iberian distribution may be linked to recolonization events from the Southern Pleistocene refugium. Conclusions/Significance: Overall, our results suggest that developmental instability in turtle carapace formation might be caused, at least in part, by genetic factors, although the influence of environmental factors affecting the developmental stability of turtle carapace cannot be ruled out.

When households do not perceive that they are vulnerable, they have less incentive to take any mitigation or adaptation actions against climate change. In reality, everyone will be affected by climate change because pricing of externalities (ie. carbon tax) will make everything more expensive. In light of this, what would households prefer to do? Would they choose to change their behaviours (e.g. drive less, turn off lights) to reduce carbon emissions in order to help the country reach its emission target, or would they prefer to pay the government (e.g. in the form of an income tax) so that they do not have to change their daily behaviours. How do these preferences vary with political preferences? A choice experiment survey was conducted to elicit households' willingness to pay for a number of climate change related policies. Results from a pilot survey of 100 households in Australia suggest that political party preference has a significant impact on household preference for climate change policy. Liberal party voters are averse to the carbon tax while non-Liberal party voters show support for carbon tax over a general income tax.","Carbon tax; Choice experiment; Climate change; Climate policy; WTP","Australia; Carbon emissions; Carbon taxes; Choice experiments; Climate change policies; Climate policy; Emission targets; Flood prone area; Income tax; Pilot surveys; Political parties; Significant impacts; Willingness to pay; WTP; Behavioral research; Economics; Experiments; Surveys; Taxation; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84858849203

With electricity generation through fossil-fuel power plants now being the economic sector with the largest source of CO 2, power plant emissions monitoring has become more important than ever in the fight against global warming. In a previous study done by Bovensmann et al. (2010), random and systematic errors of power plant CO 2 emissions have been quantified using a single overpass from a proposed CarbonSat instrument. In this study, we quantify errors of power plant annual emission estimates from a hypothetical CarbonSat and constellations of several CarbonSats while taking into account that power plant CO 2 emissions are time-dependent. Our focus is on estimating systematic errors arising from the sparse temporal sampling as well as random errors that are primarily dependent on wind speeds. We used hourly emissions data from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) combined with assimilated and re-analyzed meteorological fields from the National Centers of Environmental Prediction (NCEP). CarbonSat orbits were simulated as a sun-synchronous low-earth orbiting satellite (LEO) with an 828-km orbit height, local time ascending node (LTAN) of 13:30 (01:30 p.m. LT) and achieves global coverage after 5 days. We show, that despite the variability of the power plant emissions and the limited satellite overpasses, one CarbonSat has the potential to verify reported US annual CO 2 emissions from large power plants (≥5 Mt CO 2 yrg -1) with a systematic error of less than ∼4.9% and a random error of less than ∼6.7% for 50% of all the power plants. For 90% of all the power plants, the systematic error was less than ∼12.4% and the random error was less than ∼13%. We additionally investigated two different satellite configurations using a combination of 5 CarbonSats. One achieves global coverage everyday but only samples the targets at fixed local times. The other configuration samples the targets five times at two-hour intervals approximately every 6th day but only achieves global coverage after 5 days. From the statistical analyses, we found, as expected, that the random errors improve by approximately a factor of two if 5 satellites are used. On the other hand, more satellites do not result in a large reduction of the systematic error. The systematic error is somewhat smaller for the CarbonSat constellation configuration achieving global coverage everyday. Therefore, we recommend the CarbonSat constellation configuration that achieves daily global coverage. © Author(s) 2011.

One of the major challenges of the automotive industry and research institutes worldwide currently is to develop and realize alternative fuel concepts for passenger cars. In line with Ford's global hydrogen vehicle program, different onboard hydrogen storage technologies are under investigation. In general, hydrogen storage methods can be categorized as either physical storage of hydrogen (i.e. compressed, liquid, or cryo-compressed) or material based hydrogen storage. Currently, automotive OEMs have only introduced hydrogen fleet vehicles that utilize physical-based hydrogen storage systems but they have recognized that hydrogen storage systems need to advance further to achieve the range associated with today's gasoline vehicle. At Ford Motor Company, compressed gaseous hydrogen storage systems at 35 MPa (350 bar) have been deployed to a fleet of hydrogen fuel cell vehicles as well as internal combustion engine powered vehicles. The direct customer feedback from these hydrogen fleet vehicles was the need for improved driving range to be comparable with conventional vehicles. Through doubling the working pressure to 70 MPa (700 bar), the volumetric storage density of the fuel storage system significantly improves closing the performance gap of driving range. In this report, next-generation 70 MPa hydrogen storage systems are presented with regard to their overall design, component development, refueling capabilities, and verification testing on component, system as well as vehicle level. Overall, the 70 MPa hydrogen storage systems have demonstrated significant improvement in the compressed hydrogen fuel capacity facilitating the path for achieving greater than 300 miles range on fuel cell vehicles. The Ford 70 MPa hydrogen storage systems have been developed using the internal product development disciplines and have achieved the implementation milestone. The 70 MPa system designs were based on today's state-of-the-art hydrogen storage technology and have proven to provide the desired functionality and appropriate safety in particular with regard to certification and approval according to North America standards as well as European regulations. © 2011 SAE International.",,"Alternative fuels; Automotive industry; Environmental technology; Fleet operations; Fuel cells; Hydrogen fuels; Internal combustion engines; Vehicles; Compressed hydrogens; Environmental emissions; Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles; Hydrogen storage methods; Hydrogen storage system; Hydrogen storage technologies; Onboard hydrogen storages; Verification testing; Hydrogen storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85072353232

The objective of the present research is to study the catalytic effect of Ni on FeCZ using an evaluation of the global kinetics (activation energy, reaction rate, order and constant) of its reaction with methane for syngas production. FeCZ and 0.05NiFeCZ (Ni/Fe = 0.05 molar ratio) were synthesized through co-precipitation of their precursor nitrate salts, while 2NiFeCZ was prepared by impregnation of FeCZ with a nickel nitrate solution to obtain a 2 %W Ni material. Samples were calcined at 950°C during 4 hours in air. Kinetic study of oxygen carriers (FeCZ, 0.05NiFeCZ and 2NiFeCZ) reduction with methane was followed through thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at 5, 7.5 and 10% CH4/Ar and 600, 650 and 700°C. Initial reaction rate was obtained from the slope of the linear region of the weight change signal as a function of time. Results indicate a first order global reaction rate for all materials. Activation energies for samples FeCZ, 0.05NiFeCZ and 2NiFeCZ were 52.2, 39.5 and 28.3 Kcal/mol, respectively. Thus, reflecting the catalytic effect of Ni over the FeCZ global reaction rate. © J.

However the benefits of HCCI are limited to low and medium loads by the simultaneous occurrence of combustion instability and knock at a maximum load that is too low for conventional SI combustion. To provide smooth operation in the intermediate range between HCCI and SI requires alternative combustion strategies. One such strategy is spark-assisted compression ignition (SACI) which uses a spark plug to initiate a flame which consumes a portion of the mixture, followed by autoignition of the remaining charge. This moderates the rapid heat release and allows higher loads to be achieved without exceeding knock and stability limits. In a recent study we have explored this region and have found that spark assist at first dramatically reduces knock as load is raised above the HCCI limit; however with further load increase, knock returns, but in a form which resembles spark ignited knock rather than the HCCI knock. This study investigates in detail the knocking conditions observed in that work. The objectives of this study are twofold: first, to explore the differences between the two forms of knock; and second, to apply and compare a number of commonly used metrics for knock and noise over the range of HCCI, SACI and SI combustion. Experimental data were acquired on a single-cylinder DI research engine equipped with a fully flexible valve actuation (FFVA) system and fueled by research-grade gasoline. Cycle to cycle results based on filtered pressure traces are shown and compared with a number of knock measures including a widely used correlation for ringing intensity for HCCI combustion. Although based on a limited set of data, the results identify important qualitative features of the two forms of knock and point out significant differences among the knock metrics. The results suggest that further investigations are needed to fully understand both the knocking phenomenon and how best to quantify it. © 2011 by ASME.",,"Auto-ignition; Automotive engine; Combustion instabilities; Combustion mode; Compression ignition; Experimental data; HCCI combustion; Heat release; Higher loads; Homogeneous charge compression ignition; Maximum load; Qualitative features; Spark ignition; Stability limit; Valve actuation; Electric sparks; Engine cylinders; Fuel economy; Gasoline; Ignition; Combustion knock",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84862534370

In the United States buildings use 48% of the total energy consumed, significantly impacting national energy demand and contributing to global warming. The vast majority of architectural practice in the U.S. leads to construction of buildings with little concern to sustainability contributing to environmental degradation. However, as the environmental impact of buildings become increasingly recognized, the role of architects and the initial decision making process which determines the resource use and life-cycle of materials, systems, and construction processes, becomes more critical. In order to advance sustainable development and make green building construction the standard rather than the anomaly, the education of the architects must be reconsidered. The traditional American architectural curriculum that is based on a schism between ""design"" and ""technology"" is inherently in conflict with the principal of sustainability. Recent research in building design indicates that the most resource efficient, best performing, and environmentally sustainable buildings are designed utilizing ""integrated practice,"" in which the various disciplines involved in building design work together at the conception of the project to improve overall building performance, reduce GHG's, and lower the costs for operation and maintenance of buildings. Although large-scale reform of architectural curricula is a complex, ongoing, and difficult debate, producing teaching tools that can simulate integrated design can impact and promote a better understanding of sustainable practice in architecture. The proposed paper will present the progress of a multi-disciplinary team of faculty who are collectively working on the completion, implementation and evaluation of a simulation software package in an interactive game format. The project teaches the concepts of ""integrated design"" through immersing students in a virtual world that imitates the complexity of the real world of decisionmaking and material choices in design. The project accomplishes this by harnessing the capabilities of simulation and dynamic modelling programs as well as powerful game engines while creating compelling and rewarding reasons for student's engagement in the learning process.

Repeated inventories of soil organic carbon (SOC) organized in soil monitoring networks (SMN) are being implemented in a number of countries. This paper reviews the concepts and design of SMNs in ten countries, and discusses the contribution of such networks to reducing the uncertainty of soil carbon balances. Some SMNs are designed to estimate country-specific land use or management effects on SOC stocks, while others collect soil carbon and ancillary data to provide a nationally consistent assessment of soil carbon condition across the major land-use/soil type combinations. The former use a single sampling campaign of paired sites, while for the latter both systematic (usually grid based) and stratified repeated sampling campaigns (5-10 years interval) are used with densities of one site per 10-1,040 km2. For paired sites, multiple samples at each site are taken in order to allow statistical analysis, while for the single sites, composite samples are taken. In both cases, fixed depth increments together with samples for bulk density and stone content are recommended. Samples should be archived to allow for re-measurement purposes using updated techniques. Information on land management, and where possible, land use history should be systematically recorded for each site. A case study of the agricultural frontier in Brazil is presented in which land use effect factors are calculated in order to quantify the CO2 fluxes from national land use/management conversion matrices. Process-based SOC models can be run for the individual points of the SMN, provided detailed land management records are available. These studies are still rare, as most SMNs have been implemented recently or are in progress. Examples from the USA and Belgium show that uncertainties in SOC change range from 1.6-6.5 Mg C ha-1 for the prediction of SOC stock changes on individual sites to 11.72 Mg C ha-1 or 34% of the median SOC change for soil/land use/climate units. For national SOC monitoring, stratified sampling sites appears to be the most straightforward attribution of SOC values to units with similar soil/land use/climate conditions (i. e. a spatially implicit upscaling approach). © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.","Modeling; Sampling design; Soil monitoring networks; Soil organic carbon","agricultural soil; bulk density; carbon balance; carbon dioxide; sampling; sampling bias; soil carbon; soil organic matter; terrestrial ecosystem; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-78650370590

This is achieved by employing the unconventional spectral polarization modulation technique, optimized for linear polarimetry. The polarization modulator consists of an achromatic quarter-wave retarder and a multiple-order retarder, followed by a polarizing beamsplitter, such that the incoming polarization state is encoded as a sinusoidal modulation in the intensity spectrum, where the amplitude scales with the degree of linear polarization, and the phase is determined by the angle of linear polarization. An optimized combination of birefringent crystals creates an athermal multiple-order retarder, with a uniform retardance across the field of view. Based on these specifications, SPEX is an ideal, passive remote sensing instrument for characterizing planetary atmospheres from an orbiting, air-borne or ground-based platform. By measuring the intensity and polarization spectra of sunlight that is scattered in the planetary atmosphere as a function of the single scattering angle, aerosol microphysical properties (size, shape, composition), vertical distribution and optical thickness can be derived. Such information is essential to fully understand the climate of a planet. A functional SPEX prototype has been developed and calibrated, showing excellent agreement with end-to-end performance simulations. Calibration tests show that the precision of the polarization measurements is at least 2 • 10-4. We performed multi-angle spectropolarimetric measurements of the Earth's atmosphere from the ground in conjunction with one of AERONET's sun photometers. Several applications exist for SPEX throughout the solar system, a.o. in orbit around Mars, Jupiter and the Earth, and SPEX can also be part of a ground-based aerosol monitoring network. © 2011 Copyright Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).","aerosol; atmosphere; dust; Earth; Mars; planet; remote sensing; spectral modulation; spectropolarimetry","A-thermal; AERONET; Aerosol monitoring networks; Birefringent crystals; Calibration tests; Degree of linear polarization; End-to-end performance; Field of views; Ground based; High-accuracy; In-orbit; Intensity spectrum; Jupiters; Linear polarization; Mars; Microphysical property; Multi-angle; Multiple-order retarders; Optical thickness; Passive remote sensing; Planetary atmosphere; Planetary exploration; Polarization measurements; Polarization modulators; Polarization spectra; Polarization state; Polarizing beam splitters; Quarter waves; Retardance; Single scattering; Sinusoidal modulation; Spectral modulation; Spectral polarization; Spectropolarimeters; Spectropolarimetry; Sun photometers; Vertical distributions; Atmospheric aerosols; Calibration; Earth (planet); Interplanetary spacecraft; Modulation; Optimization; Remote sensing; Spectroscopy; Polarization",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-80053935950

Advances in air pollution monitoring techniques enable hotspots to be identified more effectively; however challenges remain as to how best to reduce the incidence and impact of these episodes. Where road traffic is the dominant source of pollutants, ITS measures, including alternative traffic management strategies, may be deployed to mitigate the hotspot and contribute towards regulatory compliance. This paper demonstrates how the real time local air quality is used as input for a dynamic traffic management system. Based on the current state of the air quality, the traffic management strategy will be adapted in order to improve the local air quality real time in an urban environment. An environmental trigger signal is developed based on the local black carbon concentrations. The trigger decides when to switchthe traffic light control system from the standard control scenario during good air quality to the EcoFLEX control scenario when the air quality is below a certain threshold. This scenario decreases the average queue lengths and number of stops at the intersection for motorized traffic and increases the average speeds, which are all favorable for reducing emissions. EnViVer simulations show an emissions reduction in EcoFLEX mode of 8.2% for NOx. The EcoFLEX system makes hotspot mitigation possible since it is possible to control the air quality locally by adapting the traffic control system, only when necessary. © 2011 by the Intelligent Transportation Society of America.",,"Air pollution monitoring; Air quality measurements; Air quality regulations; Average queue lengths; Dynamic traffic management; Environmental triggers; Traffic light control systems; Traffic management strategies; Control systems; Emission control; Motor transportation; Regulatory compliance; Speed control; Traffic control; Air quality",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84878460572

This chapter focuses on the waste streams that affect the atmosphere. The predominant concern with atmospheric waste is chemical contamination, which presents a hazard to human health. Thus, public health is usually the principal driver for assessing and controlling air contaminants. However, air pollution abatement laws and programs have also recognized that effects beyond health are also important, especially welfare protection. One of the main welfare considerations is that ecosystems are important receptors of contamination. Another welfare concern is that contaminants impact structures and other engineered systems by corrosion. Thus, from an air pollution perspective, there is a cascade of hazards from human health to ecosystems to abiotic (i.e., nonliving) systems. As far as pollution control is concerned, air pollution control must be strategic and tactical. The former is the long-term reduction of pollution levels at all scales of the problem from local to global. Goals can be set for air quality improvement 5, 10, or 15 years ahead and plans can be made to achieve these improvements. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.

However, the factors shaping the global distribution pattern of the abundance of CT's in tree leaves are still poorly understood. The purpose of this study was to assess the global distribution pattern of CT abundance in tree leaves in order to examine the effects of climatic parameters (air temperature and precipitation) and latitude as well as the effects of methodologies used for the measurement of CT concentration (extract solutions and standard substance). Through a database search, we collected 805 individual values of CT concentration in tree leaves from 72 study sites, which were reported in 26 individual studies as well as mean annual temperature, annual precipitation, and latitude. We also collected the information of extract solution and standard substance if available. We found that mean annual temperature positively correlated with the foliar CT abundance. On the other hand, annual precipitation and latitude did not have significant influences on CT abundance. We did not find significant effects of the extract solution and standard substance on the CT abundance, neither. A higher allocation of carbon to CT's may be advantageous in warmer regions, where the potential herbivore pressure may be relatively higher than that in cooler regions; however, this hypothesis could not be directly tested in this study. Our finding that foliar CT abundance is significantly associated with mean annual temperature supports the 'classical' picture of the stronger plant defenses in warmer climates. A comprehensive empirical comparison using standardized methods is still required to improve our understanding of CT abundance in tree leaves and the mechanism of ecosystem processes. © Damgaard et al.","Acid-butanol method; Annual precipitation; Condensed tannins; Global pattern; Latitude; Mean annual temperature; Metaanalysis",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-82955220195

Current climate conditions can be observed everywhere in the world but future climate conditions can only be estimated through climate simulations which produce huge amounts of quantitative data. This data leads to statements like ""temperature increase is expected to exceed 2.6°C"" or similar and remain fuzzy to non-experts in climate research. The Climate Twins application is designed to communicate climate changes in an intuitive and understandable way by showing regions which have now similar climate conditions according to a given Point of Interest (POI) in the future. This paper explains how the application seeks for locations with similar climatological patterns according to the POI. To achieve this goal a method has been developed to quantify similarity between two locations' climate data. © 2011 IFIP International Federation for Information Processing.","Climate Change; Similarity Measures; Web Mapping","Climate condition; Climate data; Climate research; Climate simulation; Future climate; Point of interest; Quantitative data; Similarity measure; Temperature increase; Web Mapping; Computer software; User interfaces; Climate change",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79960810134

The heat pump is characterized by high efficiency and large heat output, by using a state-of-the-art turbo compressor. The heat pump requires a low temperature heat source in order to achieve high efficiency. The heat demand is for several drying furnaces in the factory, which requires producing hot air of 120 °C. The heat exchanger was designed to produce the hot air. Experiments were conducted to confirm the performance of the heat exchanger under a reduced size of the heat exchanger. Low temperature heat sources are from both exhaust gas of the drying furnaces and that of an annealing furnace. The heat exchangers were also designed to recover heat of the exhaust gas from the two types of furnace. A thermal storage tank was prepared for the low temperature heat source, and for adjusting the time difference between the heat demand and the low temperature heat source. The size of the tank was determined by considering the schedule of furnaces operations. As a result of the present study, it was confirmed that the heat pump was able to satisfy the present heat demand while retaining high efficiency. Primary energy consumption and CO 2 emission of the heat pump were calculated on the basis of the present results in order to compare them with those of the boilers.

The majority of rays of light, which reach the ground from the sun in (6-8 min) cause greenhouse effect and increase the earth temperature since they are not reflected back. With climate change, polar ice-caps melt and flow into the ocean, the level of the sea raises, fresh water reserves are decreasing (due to the increase of salt water) and ecosystem components, which are essential for life and biological diversity are eroding. The organisms are forced to migrate to regions, which are lowly affected by climate changing. The resulting species and habitat shifts result in some organisms (Tarantula spp., Castanea spp., Malus floribunda, etc.), whose natural habitat is humid regions, such as tropical and coastal regions, can be encountered in temperate and inland regions (e.g., Turkey).

However, its spatial resolution could not always satisfy to express condition of lot with small spatial scale, which was generally identified in the tropical climate region. In this study, therefore, combination of ALOS/AVINIR2 and Landsat/TM/ETM+ for discriminating agricultural land use was examined for upper stream of Solo River in Indonesia as study site. At the first procedure, two indices which represented ground surface condition of soil and vegetation, were calculated from multi-temporal ALOS/AVINIR2 data. This was based on consideration of ground surface condition, which showed at one time as covered by bare soil and at another by vegetation, for cases of agricultural land use with annual crops. The next was to obtain maximum and minimum values of these indices at every pixel of image, then to classify by using these values. Classification result could discriminate agricultural land use consisted of annual crops of upland or paddy field from other land use types. However, due to the limitation of seasonal variation of obtained data and lack of mid-infrared spectral band information, upland and paddy field could not be discriminated properly. Multi-temporal Landsat/TM/ETM+ data, on the other hand, equipped spectral information which was effective to characterize surface water condition and its seasonal changes, could be used to extract paddy field area. Combining two outputs obtained from ALOS/AVINIR2 and Landsat/TM/ETM+ mentioned above, 10 meter resolution land use data was produced. By comparing with QuickBird imagery, the method developed in this study showed proper discrimination of land use types between paddy field, upland field, forest and trees, bare and manmade, and water.","Agricultural land use; Discrimination; Indonesia; Multi-platform; Multi-temporal","Agricultural land use; Discrimination; Indonesia; Multi-platform; Multi-temporal; Crops; Forestry; Land use; Landforms; Remote sensing; Vegetation; Tropics",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84865681471

Driven by combustion and agricultural emissions, such deposition is an important cause of change in ecosystem structure and function, including potentially critical changes in the remaining Bay Checkerspot Butterfly habitat. We use the Bay Checkerspot Butterfly case to examine whether the Endangered Species Act, as it currently stands, is capable of protecting endangered species from the newly appreciated, remote-origin threat of nitrogen deposition. We employ legal analysis that builds on relevant case law to determine whether the limitations on harmful activities as set by sections 7 and 9 of the Endangered Species Act can be applied to the emissions that cause nitrogen deposition. As part of the analysis, we juxtapose our case with a similar case that has become quite salient in recent discussions of conservation law: the case for using the Endangered Species Act to help control greenhouse gas emissions. Our findings leave us cautiously optimistic that the take and jeopardy prohibitions of the Endangered Species Act could be fruitfully leveraged against existing federal and state air quality and emission control programs to help improve the protection of nitrogen-sensitive species and ecosystems.",,"atmospheric deposition; butterfly; conservation management; ecosystem function; ecosystem structure; emission control; Endangered Species Act; greenhouse gas; habitat conservation; nitrogen; species conservation; Euphydryas editha bayensis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-84864032088

In so doing, we consider two accounting methods which permit greater accountability of regional private and public (household and government) final consumption as the main driver of regional emissions generation, while retaining focus on the local production technology and consumption decisions which fall under the jurisdiction of regional policy makers.

We collected in situ CO2, CO, and CH4 measurements and flask samples in the boundary layer and free troposphere over Sacramento, California, USA, during two aircraft flights over and downwind of this urban area during spring of 2009. The flask samples were analyzed for Δ14CO2 and CO 2 to determine the recently added CO2ff mole fraction. A suite of greenhouse and other trace gases, including hydrocarbons and halocarbons, were measured in the same samples. Strong correlations were observed between CO 2ff and numerous trace gases associated with urban emissions. From these correlations we estimate emission ratios between CO2ff and these species, and compare these with bottom-up inventory-derived estimates. Recent county level inventory estimates for carbon monoxide (CO) and benzene from the California Air Resources Board CEPAM database are in good agreement with our measured emission ratios, whereas older emissions inventories appear to overestimate emissions of these gases by a factor of two. For most other trace species, there are substantial differences (200-500%) between our measured emission ratios and those derived from available emission inventories. For the first flight, we combine in situ CO measurements with the measured CO:CO 2ff emission ratio of 14 ± 2 ppbCO/ppmCO2 to derive an estimate of CO2ff mole fraction throughout this flight, and also estimate the biospheric CO2 mixing ratio (CO2bio) from the difference of total and fossil CO2. The resulting CO2bio varies dramatically from up to 8 ± 2 ppm in the urban plume to -6 ± 1 ppm in the surrounding boundary layer air. Finally, we use the in situ estimates of CO2ff mole fraction to infer total fossil fuel CO2 emissions from the Sacramento region, using a mass balance approach. The resulting emissions are uncertain to within a factor of two due to uncertainties in wind speed and boundary layer height. Nevertheless, this first attempt to estimate urban-scale CO2ff from atmospheric radiocarbon measurements shows that CO2ff can be used to verify and improve emission inventories for many poorly known anthropogenic species, separate biospheric CO2, and indicates the potential to constrain CO 2ff emissions if transport uncertainties are reduced. © 2011 Author(s).",,"air quality; airborne survey; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; atmospheric transport; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon monoxide; emission inventory; fossil fuel; greenhouse gas; halocarbon; hydrocarbon; in situ measurement; mixing ratio; spring (season); trace gas; troposphere; California; Sacramento; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-79251483827
