As the final link of building energy conservation, the efficient operation and control of energy systems are quite important for passive buildings. In this paper, as for the well-used integrated ground source energy systems, physical simulation and actual measurements are carried out to compare the adaptability of different operation strategies. Specifically, after calibrated via measurements, three typical controlling strategies are simulated and compared, including temperature control, temperature difference control and timing starting control. When making comparison, indexes of Predicted Mean Vote (MPV) and Predicted Percentage Dissatisfied (PPD) are adopted. Finally, by comparing the thermal comfort and energy consumption under different control strategies, the optimal operation strategy of different seasons was suggested for passive buildings in the cold region of China. © 2021 IEEE.","control strategy; energy consumption; ground source system; passive building; thermal comfort","Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Historic preservation; Office buildings; Thermal comfort; Building energy conservation; Controlling strategies; Energy saving and emission reductions; Ground source energy; Operation and control; Optimal operation strategy; Physical simulation; Temperature differences; Zero energy buildings",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114195945

With the aim to reduce the environmental impact of this sector, the use of renewable energy sources coupled with energy storage systems in buildings has been investigated in recent years. Innovative solutions for cooling, heating, and domestic hot water in buildings can contribute to the buildings’ decarbonization by achieving a reduction of building electrical consumption needed to keep comfortable conditions. However, the environmental impact of a new system is not only related to its electrical consumption from the grid, but also to the environmental load produced in the manufacturing and disposal stages of system components. This study investigates the environmental impact of an innovative system proposed for residential buildings in Mediterranean climate through a life cycle assessment. The results show that, due to the complexity of the system, the manufacturing and disposal stages have a high environmental impact, which is not compensated by the reduction of the impact during the operational stage.

Use of electric vehicles (EV)—a potentially transformative and sustainable transport technology—can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, domestic fossil fuel demand, energy import dependency, and air pollution. Policies play an important role in the diffusion of new technologies, such as EVs, principally in their formative stage as they compete with an incumbent technology. However, great discrepancies exist across countries regarding EV support and uptake. EV diffusion is conceptualized as an outcome of policy diffusion based on national characteristics and international mechanisms. This study aims to explain the variation in EV policy diffusion across countries, by conducting an event history analysis on EV diffusion (EVs > 1% market share) between 2010 and 2017, using a sample of 60 countries. It identifies characteristics and mechanisms relevant to the novel technology's “formative phase”, focusing on the formation of state goals, international diffusion, and local technology adoption and deployment. The empirical contribution lies in identifying and validating socioeconomic and political factors and the international mechanisms influencing a country's position on the diffusion curve. This can help improve scenarios via better reflecting EV diffusion. © 2021 The Author","Electric vehicles; Event history analysis; Policy adoption; Technology diffusion","electric vehicle; empirical analysis; policy analysis; politics; socioeconomic conditions; technology adoption; technology diffusion; transportation policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104209869

These are the questions which we attempted to answer in this comprehensive study. The analysis is performed for a specific potential implementation of this system in Prague and adjacent municipalities. In this work, we compare the current state, where mixed municipal waste is transported to an incineration plant directly by garbage trucks, with variants if mixed municipal waste were taken to transfer stations and from there transported over a longer distance in a large volume by means of tram or truck. Our results show that use of trams results in an overall cost level of €16.41 per ton of waste transported, which represents a slight saving against the existing system at a cost of €17.19 per ton. From the purely economic perspective, however, this does not compete with transportation by truck at €12.28 per ton – above all due to high initial investment into new cargo trams. From the environmental viewpoint, deploying trams brings benefits largely on the local level, where emissions would be reduced by about 50% against the current state. In the global view, assessed through the Life Cycle Assessment method, it appears however only to transfer emissions to the point of energy production, and from this perspective the use of trams is beneficial only if linked with a notable shift from fossil fuel energy to nuclear or renewable sources. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cargo tram; Combined waste transport; Economic assessment; Life Cycle Assessment; Sustainability assessment; Waste transport","Economics; Fossil fuels; Investments; Life cycle; Solid wastes; Trucks; Urban transportation; Waste incineration; 'current; Cargo tram; Combined waste transport; Economic assessments; Incineration plant; Municipal waste; Sustainability assessment; Sustainability evaluations; Urban areas; Waste transport; Sustainable development; cost-benefit analysis; economic analysis; energy use; environmental economics; feasibility study; fossil fuel; incineration; life cycle analysis; municipal solid waste; sustainability; transportation system; waste facility; waste management; Article; carbon footprint; cost; energy yield; environmental sustainability; incineration; life cycle assessment; municipal waste; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); risk factor; traffic and transport; city; incineration; motor vehicle; solid waste; waste disposal; Czech Republic; Prague [Czech Republic]; Cities; Incineration; Motor Vehicles; Refuse Disposal; Solid Waste; Transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102785073

However, ligand-controlled catalysis for macromolecules, which differ from small molecules in penetrability and charge transfer behavior due to their bulky sizes, still remains undiscovered. Here, we systematically investigate the role of surface ligands in the photocatalytic performance of cadmium selenide (CdSe) QDs in light-induced atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) by using thiol-based ligands with various polarities and chain lengths. A highly enhanced polymerization efficiency was observed when 3-mercapto propionic acid (MPA), a short-chain and polar ligand, was used to modify the CdSe QDs' surface, achieving high chain-end fidelity, good temporal control, and a dispersity of 1.18, while also tolerating a wide-range of functional monomers ranging from acrylates to methacrylates and fluorinated monomers. Transient absorption spectroscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence studies reveal interesting mechanistic details of electron and hole transfers from the excited QDs to the initiators and 3-MPA capping ligands, respectively, providing key mechanistic insight of these ligand controlled and QD photocatalyzed ATRP processes. The thiolate ligands were found to serve as an efficient hole acceptor for QDs, which facilitates the formation of a charge-separated state, followed by electron transfer from the conduction band edge to initiators and ultimately suppressing charge recombination within the QD. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Absorption spectroscopy; Cadmium compounds; Charge transfer; Efficiency; Electron transport properties; Free radical reactions; II-VI semiconductors; Ligands; Molecules; Monomers; Nanocrystals; Organic polymers; Polymerization; Propionic acid; Quantum efficiency; Selenium compounds; Semiconductor quantum dots; Charge recombinations; Charge-separated state; Conduction band edge; Fluorinated monomers; Photocatalytic performance; Semiconducting quantum dots; Time-resolved photoluminescence; Transient absorption spectroscopies; Atom transfer radical polymerization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106665357

The sparrow algorithm is used to solve the timing of single intersection signal lights, and the VISSIM simulation platform is secondary developed to verify the energy-saving benefits of the method. The simulation platform test shows that, under the single intersection traffic signal timing optimization scheme, the average queue length of the intersection decreases by 26.26% compared with the non-active state, the delay time decreases by 27.64%, the intersection throughput increases by 13.94%, the TTI index increases by 43.4%, and the average carbon emission decreases by 31.89%, which has a significant effect on reducing the emission of single intersection. © 2021 IEEE.","Average carbon emissions; Sparrow algorithm; Timing of signal lamp; VISSIM simulation","Carbon; Data communication systems; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Information systems; Information use; Signaling; Simulation platform; Timing circuits; Traffic signals; Travel time; Average queue lengths; Carbon emissions; Energy-saving benefits; Exhaust emission; Single intersections; Timing optimization; Traffic delays; Traffic signal timings; Traffic congestion",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111425910

This paper estimates the effect of comprehensive demonstration of fiscal policy for ECER (Energy Conservation and Emission Reduction) on pollution emissions in Chinese cities with the sample period from 2003 to 2016, which is an important practice for policy integration. We find that this policy reduces the industrial SO2 (sulfur dioxide) emission by 23.8% on average and the industrial wastewater emission by 17.5% on average. This policy, implemented by Chinese government, has effectively achieved its target for emission reduction. A series of robustness checks are also conducted to verify the baseline results. Mechanism analysis indicates that this policy has the effect by the change in the industry structure and the enhancement of fiscal capacity, especially the capacity of fiscal revenue. Some policy recommendations, such as laying emphasis on the policy integration, integrating the financial resources of governments and expanding the demonstration effect, are proposed in order to facilitate green development in Chinese cities. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we utilized comprehensive satellite, ground-level observations, and source-oriented chemical transport modeling to investigate the O3 variations during the COVID-19 pandemic in China. Here, we found that the significant elevated O3 in the North China Plain (40%) and Yangtze River Delta (35%) were mainly attributed to the enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity (AOC) in these regions, associated with the meteorology and emission reduction during lockdown. Besides, O3 formation regimes shifted from VOC-limited regimes to NOx-limited and transition regimes with the decline of NOx during lockdown. We suggest that future O3 control policies should comprehensively consider the effects of AOC on the O3 elevation and coordinated regulations of the O3 precursor emissions. © 2021.

Elemental analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (13C-NMR), and adsorption experiment of CH4 were applied to establish the macromolecular model of Danhou lignite. Then, molecular mechanics (MM) and molecular dynamics (MD) were utilized to optimize the coal macromolecular model, and the density of coal was determined via adding periodic boundary conditions. The mechanism of gas adsorption by OCFGs was studied by grand canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) and density functional theory (DFT). The results showed that the aromatic structures mostly exist in the form of pyrenes; the structure of aliphatic carbons are mostly methylene and methine groups; the alkanes are mostly long chains; oxygen atoms are mainly in the form of hydroxyl groups and ether groups; nitrogen atoms are mainly in the form of pyridines; and the density of Danhou lignite is 1.25 g/cm3. The isotherm adsorption curve and Langmuir adsorption curve have a good fit, a single coal molecule reaches saturation after absorbing four CH4 molecules, and the error between experiment and simulation is small. The results of DFT calculation showed that the adsorption of CH4 by OCFGs is affected by the adsorption positions and adsorption directions. Due to CH4 molecules are affected by different electrostatic forces, the adsorption capacities of OCFGs are different, and the order is carbonyl groups &gt; ether bonds &gt; hydroxyl groups &gt; carboxyl groups.

Accordingly, accurate prediction for PM2.5 plays a vital role in taking precautions against upcoming air ambient pollution incidents. However, due to the disturbance of seasonal and nonlinear characteristics in the raw series, pronounced forecasts are confronted with tremendous handicaps, even though for seasonal grey prediction models in the preceding researches. A novel seasonal nonlinear grey model is initially designed to address such issues by integrating the seasonal adjustment factor, the conventional Weibull Bernoulli grey model, and the cultural algorithm, simultaneously depicting the seasonality and nonlinearity of the original data.

A framework that integrates computer vision and traffic modeling is proposed to link the real-world transport systems and operable virtual traffic models for the signal timing optimization at multiple intersections. The integrative framework consists of six main steps, including configuring real-time video sources, conducting transfer-learning to develop the vehicle detector, comparing and selecting vehicle trackers, collecting traffic parameters by referring to the CV-TM ontology, establishing and running the traffic model, and operating simulation-based optimizations. The proposed integrative framework is demonstrated through a case study of the signal timing optimization at multi-intersections in a real-world road network. Three critical information items including the traffic volumes, vehicle compositions, and vehicles’ turning ratios are derived from real-time surveillance videos, and the extracted information is then automatically incorporated into TM to optimize the signal timings of interconnected intersections in a near-real-time manner. In comparison with the original signal scheme, the optimized one can reduce 14.2 % of average vehicle delays, 18.9 % of vehicle stops, 9.1 % of average travel time, and 2.3 % of pollutant emissions in this specific case. The results indicate that synchronously optimizing signal timings at multiple intersections increase not only the transportation efficiency but also the environmental friendliness of road transport systems. The proposed CV-TM integration framework is demonstrated to be a promising way for conducting near-real-time signal timing optimizations in intricate traffic scenes instead of at isolated intersections, helping decision-makers to promptly respond to the time-varying traffic conditions during various real-world events, and facilitating the transportation systems and cities to achieve sustainable development goals. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Computer vision; Ontology; Signal timing; Traffic modeling; Transfer learning","Computer vision; Decision making; Efficiency; Motor transportation; Optimization; Pollution; Real time systems; Roads and streets; Security systems; Street traffic control; Sustainable development; Timing circuits; Transfer learning; Travel time; Vehicles; Environmental friendliness; Real world road networks; Real-time surveillance; Road transport systems; Signal timing optimization; Simplified analytical methods; Simulation-based optimizations; Transportation efficiency; Traffic signals",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101636385

Compared with the first-order kinetic models, explicit microbial models are expected to better simulate nonlinear carbon (C)-cycle phenomena, such as the pulse dynamics of soil heterotrophic respiration driven by dry-rewetting cycles in grasslands. However, these two types of models (i.e., linear conventional and nonlinear microbial models) have never been compared based on in situ observations of soil heterotrophic respiration in the semi-arid grassland, which is significantly affected by the dry-rewetting events. Here, based on the field data of soil heterotrophic respiration in a semi-arid grassland in northern China, we first showed that the shift from a conventional linear model to a nonlinear microbial model did not substantially improve the simulation of soil heterotrophic respiration. Then, we quantified the contributions of different moisture-response functions to the uncertainty in simulating the soil C dynamics. The results showed that the selection of moisture-response functions combined with parameterization in the soil C models dominated the modeled uncertainties in soil heterotrophic respiration. These findings suggest that both the conventional linear model and nonlinear microbial model can simulate well the pulse dynamic of soil heterotrophic respiration in grasslands with an improved parameterization of water regulation on soil carbon decomposition. This study also calls for more observations of nonlinear C phenomena for reducing the simulation uncertainty on soil C cycling in Earth system models. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

A hypothetical model about the relationship between campus perception, self-concept clarity, intentional self-regulation, and study engagement was tested. A total of 1597 students from Gansu Province, China, selected through a convenience sampling technique, were surveyed utilizing self-rated scales. Data were collected utilizing the Study Engagement Scale, Perceptions of School Climate Scale, Intentional Self-Regulation Scale and Self-Concept Clarity Scale. Results showed lower to moderate positive correlations between study variables. Students’ campus environment perceptions positively predicted adolescents’ study engagement. This association was also mediated by self-concept clarity and intentional self-regulation. All of these factors explained 41.26% vari-ability of the study engagement.

Cu-based electrocatalysts have drawn noteworthy attention due to their capability to produce C1, and C2+ products. However, challenges still exist in materials design towards highly active, selective and stable C─C coupling to produce high value-added fuels and chemicals. Meanwhile, CO2RR is a typical electrochemical reaction that occurs on the gas-liquid-solid three phase contact, therefore mass transportation stands as a key factor that influences both the activity as well as selectivity. Consequently, many efforts have been made towards the development of catalysts, electrolyte and electrochemical cell systems, to optimize the intrinsic activity and selectivity as well as mass transfer behavior. The goal of this review is to provide in-depth understanding on active sites engineering of the Cu based electrocatalysts and mass transfer ability of the cell configuration. In the first part, strategies to regulate the coordination state and electronic structure of Cu atoms were introduced for the optimization of the binding strength of key intermediates such as ∗CO, ∗CHO and ∗OCCO, and for the regulation of intermediates adsorption approach such as the ratio of atop-bound CO to bridge-bound CO, as well as to increase CO∗ coverages and lower the CO∗ dimerization barrier. In the second part, the design of new electrode structures and electrocatalytic cells to tune the mass transfer behavior of CO2RR reagents to enable unobstructed CO2 diffusion pathway and altered protons supply for the improvement of the activity at low overpotential and selectivity at high current density have been systematically discussed. Finally, we summarized the design principles for the Cu based electrocatalysts, the electrode structure, and cell configuration to optimize the adsorption/desorption of intermediates and diffusion of reagents and products. However, challenges in optimizing the reaction pathway still exist, we put up with some perspectives for future investigation of CO2RR mechanism, and promising strategies for stable higher C2+ production with high current density. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cu-based catalysts; Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions; Electrode structure design; Mass transportation; Selectivity","Carbon dioxide; Catalyst selectivity; Cell engineering; Copper; Electrocatalysts; Electrodes; Electrolysis; Electrolytes; Electron emission; Electronic structure; Fossil fuels; Mass transfer; Mass transportation; Product design; Reagents; Reduction; Adsorption/desorption; Electrochemical reactions; Electrochemical systems; Gas liquid solid three phase; High current densities; In-depth understanding; Intrinsic activities; Mass transfer dynamics; Structural design",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101374501

Environmental information disclosure, as a means of environmental regulation, have significant effect on SO2 removal rate. This paper uses the Pollution Information Transparency Index (PITI) of 113 cities in China from 2008 to 2017, jointly released by Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs and Natural Resources Defense Council, to empirically analyze the impact of pollution information transparency index on SO2 removal rate and its spatial spillover effect by employing fixed effect model and spatial Durbin model. Theoretically, environmental information disclosure will exhibit a positive effect on SO2 removal of the local city through the “target accountability” and “backward forcing effect”, and displays a spatial spillover effect on the surrounding cities through the “warning effect” and “learning effect”. The empirical results prove the theoretical analysis: (1) SO2 removal amount and emissions have a significant positive spatial correlation, show spatial agglomeration characteristics of “high-high” or “low-low”; (2) In the local city, pollution information transparency index shows a significant emission reduction effect, that is, it reduces the SO2 emission and improves SO2 removal rate; (3) There is a significant positive spatial spillover effect on the environmental information disclosure. A 1% increase in pollution information transparency index of surrounding cities will contribute to the increase of SO2 removal rate of the local city by about 0.959%, which verifies the “warning effect” and “learning effect”; (4) Further analysis verdicts that environmental information disclosure also has emission reduction effect on other industrial pollutants, and instrumental variable model and robustness test support the above conclusions.

However, rare studies are known about greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the paddy-upland rotation with green manure incorporation. Therefore, we conducted a field experiment of two years to compared with the effect of two kinds of green manure (CV: Chinese milk vetch and OR: Oilseed rape), and two kinds of cropping system (DR: double rice system and PR: paddy-upland rotation) on greenhouse gases emissions. We have found that the annual accumulation of CH4 of Chinese milk vetch-rice-sweet potato || soybean was significantly reduced by 32.95%∼63.22% compared with other treatments, mainly because Chinese milk vetch reduced the abundance of methanogens by reducing soil C/N ratio. Meanwhile increasing soil permeability resulting from paddy-upland rotation also reduced soil CH4 emission. However, The annual accumulation of N2O of Chinese milk vetch-rice-sweet potato || soybean was increased by 17.39%∼870.11% compared with other treatments, mainly attributed to paddy-upland rotation decreased soil pH and nosZ abundance and increased nirK and nirS, thus enhancing N2O emission, meanwhile the Chinese milk vetch incorporation and its interaction with the paddy-upland rotation has greatly enhanced the contents of NO3−-N and abundance of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA).

However, the association between long-term exposure to air pollutants, which increases cardiopulmonary damage, and vulnerability to COVID-19 has not yet been fully established. We collected data of confirmed COVID-19 cases during the first wave of the epidemic in mainland China. We fitted a generalized linear model using city-level COVID-19 cases and severe cases as the outcome, and long-term average air pollutant levels as the exposure. Our analysis was adjusted using several variables, including a mobile phone dataset, covering human movement from Wuhan before the travel ban and movements within each city during the period of the emergency response. Other variables included smoking prevalence, climate data, socioeconomic data, education level, and number of hospital beds for 324 cities in China. After adjusting for human mobility and socioeconomic factors, we found an increase of 37.8% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 23.8%–52.0%), 32.3% (95% CI: 22.5%–42.4%), and 14.2% (7.9%–20.5%) in the number of COVID-19 cases for every 10-μg/m3 increase in long-term exposure to NO2, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively. However, when stratifying the data according to population size, the association became non-significant. The present results are derived from a large, newly compiled and geocoded repository of population and epidemiological data relevant to COVID-19. The findings suggested that air pollution may be related to population vulnerability to COVID-19 infection, although the extent to which this relationship is confounded by city population density needs further exploration. This research reported a national-level association with long-term exposure to air pollutants and COVID-19 cases covering 324 cities in China. © 2020 The Author(s)","Air pollution; Chronic exposure; Coronavirus disease 2019; COVID-19","Air pollution; Pulmonary diseases; Cardio-vascular disease; Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease; Confidence interval; Generalized linear model; Population densities; Smoking prevalences; Socio-economic data; Socio-economic factor; Population statistics; atmospheric pollution; cardiovascular disease; confidence interval; COVID-19; disease spread; epidemic; health risk; hypertension; pollution effect; pollution exposure; smoking; vulnerability; air pollution; Article; China; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; disease association; disease severity; emergency care; environmental exposure; environmental temperature; epidemic; human; intensive care unit; long term exposure; major clinical study; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; physical mobility; prevalence; relative humidity; socioeconomics; virus spike; air pollutant; city; environmental exposure; epidemiology; particulate matter; China; Coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; COVID-19; Environmental Exposure; Epidemics; Humans; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101067501

The Three-River Headwaters (TRH), as a sensitive and fragile region, was selected as the study area. The β for 2001–2018 was estimated from the evapotranspiration product (ETMOD16) of MODIS and the net radiation of the land surface through the albedo from GLASS. The ETMOD16 data were evaluated against the observation data (ETOBS) at two alpine grassland flux towers obtained from ChinaFLUX. The interannual trend of the β was analyzed by multiple linear regression (MLR) and structure model (SEM) with the multiple factors of precipitation, temperature, humidity, albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI, MOD09Q1). The results show that the ETMOD16 values were significantly correlated with ETOBS, with a correlation coefficient above 0.70 (P &lt; 0.01) for the two sites. In 2001–2018, the regional mean β was 2.52 ± 0.77 for the whole grassland, and its spatial distribution gradually increased from the eastern to western region. The interannual β showed a downward trend with a slope of −0.025 and a multiple regression coefficient (R2) of 0.21 (P = 0.056). Most of the variability (51%) in the interannual β can be explained by the linear regression of the above multiple factors, and the temperature plays a dominant role for the whole region. The SEM analysis further shows that an increasing NDVI results in a decreasing albedo with a path coefficient of −0.57, because the albedo was negatively correlated with NDVI (R2 = 0.52, P &lt; 0.01), which indicates a negative and indirect effect on β from vegetation restoration. An obvious warming climate was found to prompt more evapotranspiration, and restoring vegetation makes the land surface receive more radiation, which both resulted in a decreasing trend in the annual β. This study revealed the biogeophysical mechanisms of vegetation restoration under a changing climate, and demonstrated the Bowen ratio can be applied as an indicator of climate-regulating functions in ecosystem assessments. © 2021, Editorial office of Journal of Resources and Ecology.

However, acidogenic fermentation is still facing challenges such as low yield of carboxylic acids and difficulties in product recovery and purification. The emission of acidogenic off-gas CO2 leads to a reduced carbon recovery (∼70%) and also increases the carbon footprint of the anaerobic treatment process. In this study, a tailored electrodialysis stack was integrated with a fermenter to recover the products and hence to improve quantity and quality of the produced carboxylic acids. Three levels of currents, i.e., 0.4, 1, and 4 A (T1, T2, and T3), were applied during electrodialytic separation of carboxylic acids and 12 cycles of electrodialysis were carried out to evaluate the performance of the integrated system. Results showed that different degrees of carboxylic acids removal led to varied impacts on the yield of carboxylic acids, economic viability, and the instability of microbial community. Compared with the case without coupling electrodialysis process, the carbon conversion rate increased by 28.04% in T3, which was due to the reuse of inorganic carbon introduced by a tailored electrodialysis process. After 12 cycles of fermentation, the percentage of Clostridiales finally increased from 0.11% (inoculum) to 31.15% in T3, which also confirmed the possible autotrophic acidogenesis by using inorganic carbon. This work would provide a promising solution to improve the recovery of carboxylic acids from organic wastes and achieve minimum carbon footprint in the organic waste management process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Acidogenic fermentation; Carbon conversion rate; Carboxylic acids; Electrodialysis; Energy consumption","Carbon footprint; Carboxylic acids; Electrodialysis; Energy utilization; Recovery; Waste management; Acid recovery; Acidogenic fermentation; Anaerobic fermentation; Carbon conversion rate; Carbon conversions; Energy-consumption; High carbons; Inorganic carbon; Low-yield; Organic wastes; Fermentation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102858462

PPCPs can be discharged to the aquatic environment from various sources, including municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), animal feeding operations, hospitals, and pharmaceutical manufacturers. A major challenge to regional characterization of ecological and human health risks is identification of the environmental emissions of PPCPs. This study established a facile approach for calculation of PPCP emission factors from raw wastewater and wastewater effluent. Using reported concentrations from WWTPs, nine PPCPs, namely carbamazepine, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, ofloxacin, sulfadiazine, sulfamethoxazole, and trimethoprim, were identified as priority contaminants based on environmental significance (i.e., high detection frequency and potential ecological risk) and data availability. Emission factors were calculated for the nine PPCPs in raw wastewater, secondary effluent, and tertiary effluent for low, medium and high emission scenarios according to the concentration distributions of these nine PPCPs. The emission factors were used to estimate the mass of the PPCPs discharged from the nine provinces and two municipalities of the Yangtze River valley. The total mass of the nine PPCPs emitted into the watershed was estimated as 3867 kg, 8808 kg and 21,464 kg for low, medium and high emission scenarios respectively in 2018. Although uncertainty is inevitable in the emission factors, the reported approach provides a viable alternative to top-down and multimedia fugacity estimation strategies that require an abundance of sewershed-, WWTP-, and compound-specific information that is difficult to collect in developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biological treatment; Contaminants of emerging concern; Disinfection; Emission factors; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products; Wastewater treatment plants","Amides; Antibiotics; Developing countries; Effluents; Health risks; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Concentration distributions; Contaminants of emerging concerns; Environmental significance; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; Pharmaceutical manufacturers; Pharmaceuticals and personal care products; Potential ecological risk; Wastewater treatment plants; Sewage treatment plants; carbamazepine; chlorine; ciprofloxacin; environmental, industrial and domestic chemicals; erythromycin; ibuprofen; ketoprofen; ofloxacin; sulfadiazine; trimethoprim; cosmetic; drug; discharge; disinfection; emission; estimation method; persistent organic pollutant; PPCP; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; aquatic environment; Article; concentration (parameter); effluent; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; health hazard; municipal wastewater; pollution transport; priority journal; ultraviolet irradiation; waste water treatment plant; water analysis; watershed; animal; city; environmental monitoring; human; sewage; wastewater; water management; water pollutant; China; Yangtze Valley; Animals; Cities; Cosmetics; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Pharmaceutical Preparations; Waste Disposal, Fluid; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100177495

Here, using in-situ PM2.5 (particles with the aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) measurement, atmospheric reanalysis data and a chemical transport model, we show that meridional distribution of PM2.5 loadings is strongly modulated by the intensity of East Asian winter monsoon (EAWM). The EAWM drives the heavily polluted zone in eastern China to migrate southward, i.e., under stronger EAWM, more southward migration of air pollution occurs. We expect that the migration will likely re-distribute carbon sources- and sinks-related ecosystem, posing a new challenge for the Chinese government, who needs to implement region-different emission reduction plans in the future, to mitigate air pollution and to go carbon neutral. © 2021.

The intensity of this photolysis reaction affects atmospheric oxidation and photochemical pollution process. Photolysis rate of nitrogen dioxide (JNO2) is affected by aerosols, temperature, solar zenith angle (SZA), clouds, and so on. Among them, aerosol is an important influencing factor because of its complicated and irregular change; aerosol quantitative effect on JNO2 is constructive for the coordinated control of O3 and particulate matter. In order to quantitatively assess the impact of aerosols on JNO2 in the long-term, the reconstructed JNO2 data in a suburban site in North China from 2005 to 2019 are used. We found that JNO2 and aerosol optical depth (AOD) presented logarithmic relations under different solar zenith angle (SZA) levels, the aerosol attenuation effect on JNO2 decreased as AOD increased. Two main influencing factors of JNO2, SZA, and AOD, were fitted into a quadratic polynomial to quantify the AOD effect on JNO2. The results showed that the average annual AOD effect on JNO2 in Xianghe from 2005 to 2019 was −28.6% compared to an aerosol free atmosphere; the seasonal mean AOD effect in spring, summer, autumn, and winter was −27.1% and −35.1%, −25.5% and −26.3%, respectively. During the study period, JNO2 increased with an average of 5 × 10−5 s−1 per year, while the annual average aerosol optical depth (AOD) was 0.80 ± 0.10, showing an overall downward trend. Annual mean AOD attenuation effect on JNO2 decreased over time; the decreases were larger in spring and summer, and smaller in autumn and winter. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Aerosol optical depth; JNO2; Long-term; Quantitative effect","Air pollution; Electromagnetic wave attenuation; Nitrogen oxides; Optical properties; Photolysis; Aerosol optical depths; Atmospheric oxidation; Attenuation effect; Co-ordinated control; Photochemical pollution; Photolysis reaction; Quadratic polynomial; Quantitative effects; Aerosols; nitrogen oxide; ozone; aerosol; nitrogen dioxide; optical depth; oxidation; ozone; photolysis; quantitative analysis; reaction kinetics; seasonal variation; suburban area; troposphere; aerosol; aerosol optical depth; Article; atmosphere; autumn; China; controlled study; limit of quantitation; particulate matter; photolysis; physical parameters; quantitative analysis; seasonal variation; solar zenith angle; spring; suburban area; summer; trend study; winter; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100412760

There is a huge potential to improve the energy recovery efficiency of the current waste treatment system. This study aims to propose an efficient waste management system to reduce the landfill amount and improve the energy recovery rate (ERE) of Municipal Solid Waste (MSW) treatment by considering environment, energy, economic, and policy effects. This study selects Beijing as a case study city and proposes four different MSW treatment scenarios. The landfill reduction amount, energy recovery efficiency, life cycle costs and benefits, and the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions are evaluated. Furthermore, the impact of waste separation policy on the landfill amount, and the proposed internal rate of return (IRR) index are also quantified. The results show that the proposed scenarios can significantly reduce the amount of landfill. Scenario 4 (MBT system) ranks the highest, with a value of 92.69%. From the energy recovery and GHG emissions reduction perspectives, scenario 4 can achieve the highest energy recovery efficiency (65.33%) and the highest GHG emissions reduction (2.09 × 106 tons CO2e). From the economic perspective, scenario 3 can achieve the highest benefit with a value of 6.00 × 109 CNY. Such benefits are highly affected by the factors of the treatment capacity, the tipping fee and the power generation efficiency. With the continuous implementation of waste separation policy and waste-to-energy option in China, it is critical to assess the related environmental and economic benefits so that an efficient waste management system can be established. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cost-benefit analysis; Incineration; Methane fermentation; Urban governance; Waste to energy","Earnings; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Energy management systems; Environmental management; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Life cycle; Recovery; Waste treatment; Economic perspective; Energy recovery efficiency; Energy recovery rate; Environmental issues; Internal rate of return; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Power generation efficiency; Waste management systems; Municipal solid waste; detection method; economic conditions; emission control; energy efficiency; landfill; life cycle analysis; policy implementation; power generation; urban area; urbanization; waste management; Beijing [China]; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100710243

It is necessary for the government to inspire the local transportation system to reduce its pollution emissions. Therefore, this article uses the environmental protection subsidy (EPS) to attract passengers to choose green travel. In order to obtain the optimal solution for green transportation, we propose a bi-level multi-objective optimization model based on the collaborative optimization between EPS coefficient and high-speed rail (HSR) operation planning. There are three main game players, namely the government, HSR enterprise, and passengers. We develop a hybrid optimization algorithm to solve the model and verify this proposed methodology by using the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei intercity transportation network. Our results show that the EPS has a significant impact on intercity travel. As demand increases, the EPS coefficient gradually decreases from 0.85 to 0.

Accordingly, this paper investigates the dynamic impact of energy poverty on CO2 emissions in China. By proposing a new and comprehensive evaluation index, we assess the energy poverty levels in 30 Chinese provinces for the period 2002–2017. Then, we re-estimate the impact of energy poverty on CO2 emissions using the system-generalized method of moments (SYS-GMM) method. We find that although significant differences exist in energy poverty across various regions in China, the country's total level of energy poverty displays a downward trend over the period 2002–2017. Furthermore, energy poverty can accelerate the growth of CO2 emissions in China. In regions with high-level energy poverty, a bidirectional causal link exists between energy poverty and CO2 emissions, while a unidirectional causality runs from energy poverty to CO2 emissions in regions with low-level energy poverty. The findings of this paper, therefore, add to the existing literature and provide important policy implications for curbing CO2 emissions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","China; CO2 emissions; Energy poverty; Heterogeneity and asymmetry; SYS-GMM estimation","Carbon dioxide; Public policy; Carbon reduction; China; CO$-2$/ emission; Comprehensive evaluation index; Dynamic impacts; Energy poverties; Generalized method of moments; Heterogeneity and asymmetry; Reduction targets; System-generalized method of moment estimation; Method of moments; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; energy use; environmental economics; environmental impact; estimation method; poverty; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101995890

However, drastic change in rainfall caused by urbanization and climate change has dramatically reduced the rainfall data's representativeness. This study examines the impact of spatial-temporal rainfall changes over the past 50 years and evaluates the influence on the stability of rainwater source control effects in Beijing. The result shows that the rainfall variation trends differ in different regions in Beijing. In most areas, stable Volume Capture Ratio (VCR) cannot be achieved by a fixed size design rainfall depth, and highly urbanized areas are the most sensitive on source control effect. The design rainfall obtained from recent rainfall records may be on the low side, and the design rainfall should be increased to some extent to meet the 85% VCR goal in the future.

Herein, Cu-decorated Bi/Bi2O3 nanofoam (P-Cu-BiNF) with a 3D porous network structure was prepared for the first time via a simple fast-reduction method. Characterizations indicate that the introduction of Cu can significantly regulate the microstructure and electronic states of Bi/Bi2O3. Consequently, the as-prepared P-Cu-BiNF exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance toward the CO2RR. Remarkably, the faradaic efficiency of formate production can exceed 90% in a wide potential range from -0.78 to -1.08 V. Meanwhile, it can also deliver a high formate partial current density of up to 62.7 mA cm-2 at -1.18 V and long-term stability.

This paper adopts a new perspective from the household-consumption side to investigate the CH4 emissions of major economies in 2014 and compares it with the scenario under the final-demand-based perspective by combing the world input-output database and the latest emission data from the UNFCCC and EDGAR v5.0 database. Budgets of CH4 emissions for 43 economies are established and trade connections &amp; balances among major economies are explored. Results show that consumption-driven economies are allocated more CH4 emissions in the household-consumption-based accounting (HCBA) framework compared to the final-demand-based accounting (FDBA) framework. The total trade-related transfer of CH4 emissions is shown to sum up to 19% and 27% of the global total under the HCBA and FDBA frameworks, respectively.

Traditional risk factors for COPD include aging, genetic predisposition, cigarette smoking, exposure to environmental pollutes, occupational exposure, and individual or parental respiratory disease history. In addition, latest studies have revealed novel and emerging risk factors. In this review, differential gender difference as a factor for COPD development at different territories is discussed for the first time. First, women seem to have more COPD, while more women die of COPD or have more severe COPD, in Western societies. This seems different from the impression that COPD dominants in men, which is true in Eastern societies. It might be related to higher rate of cigarette smoking in women in developed countries (i.e., 12.0% of women in United States smoke vs. 2.2% in China). Nonetheless, women in Eastern societies are exposed to more biomass usage. Second, modest elevation in PM2.5 levels at &gt;∼21.4–32.7 μg/m3, previously considered “cleaner air,” is associated with incidence of COPD, indicating that more stringent goals should be set for the reduction of PM2.5 levels to prevent COPD development. Last but not least, e-cigarette use, which has become an epidemic especially among adolescents as officially declared by the United States government, has severe adverse effects that may cause development of COPD early in life. Built upon an overview of the established risk factors for COPD primarily focusing on cigarette smoking and environmental pollutions, the present review further discusses novel concepts, mechanisms, and solutions evolved around the emerging risk factors for COPD discussed above, understanding of which would likely enable better intervention of this devastating disease. © Copyright © 2021 Zhang, Wang, Mutlu and Cai.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD); cigarette smoking; e-cigarettes; environmental pollution; gender difference; modest elevation in PM2.5; risk factors","air pollution; biomass; China; chronic obstructive lung disease; cigarette smoking; concentration (parameter); developed country; disease association; disease predisposition; disease severity; environmental exposure; epidemic; genetic association; geographic distribution; government regulation; household; human; incidence; law enforcement; lung function; occupational exposure; particulate matter 2.5; pathogenesis; pollution; prevalence; Review; risk factor; risk reduction; sex difference; smoking cessation; United States",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106146540

Identified the sources of carbon emission performance differences and the influence of various driving factors in China’s eight economic regions accurately is the premise for realizing China’s carbon emission reduction goals. Based on the provincial panel data from 2005 to 2017, the super-efficiency SBM model and Malmquist model are constructed in this paper to measure regional carbon emission performance’s static and dynamic changes. After that, the Theil index is used to distinguish the impact of inter-regional and intra-regional differences on different regions’ carbon emissions performance. Finally, by introducing the Tobit model, the effect of various driving factors on carbon emission performance differences is analyzed quantitatively. The results show that: (1) There are significant differences in different regions’ carbon emission performance, but the overall carbon emission performance presents an upward fluctuation trend. Malmquist index decomposition results show substantial differences in technology progress index and technology efficiency index in different regions, leading to significant carbon emission performance differences. (2) Overall, inter-regional differences contribute the most to the overall carbon emission performance, up to more than 80%. Among them, the inter-regional and intra-regional differences in ERMRYR contributed significantly. (3) Through Tobit regression analysis, it is found that residents’ living standards, urbanization level, ecological development degree, and industrial structure positively affect carbon emission performance. On the contrary, energy intensity presents an apparent negative correlation on carbon emission performance. Therefore, to improve the carbon emission performance, we should put forward targeted suggestions according to the characteristics of different regional development stages, regional carbon emission differences, and influencing driving factors.

Traditionally, it is believed that occupant behavior aligns with people's energy-related attitude. However, an attitude-behavior gap has been observed in many recent studies, which rarely focused on specific attitudes and behaviors in urban residential buildings. Therefore, based on a large-scale empirical survey (N = 1003) in Beijing, China, we explore the relationship between energy-related attitudes and behaviors. Specifically, purchase and habitual behaviors are investigated along with relevant attitudes, including the willingness to pay (WTP) more for energy efficient products, whether paying attention (WPA) to energy efficiency parameters/indicators of products when making a purchase, and the willingness to change behavior (WTC) for further residential energy reduction. The results show a mixed picture. There is a consistency between the occupants’ WPA and purchase behavior. In contrast, the occupants generally don't behave consistently with their reported WTP and WTC, suggesting the existence of attitude-behavior gaps. Different reasons may lead to these gaps, demonstrating the necessity of a more comprehensive and flexible strategy for energy policymaking. Furthermore, a closer look at the factors underlying different attitudes shows the significant effects that perceived building thermal insulation performance and past experiences of changing behavior may have, suggesting the effectiveness and importance of building thermal retrofits and more targeted awareness campaigns. A self-reinforcing feedback loop may exist between attitude and behavior, demonstrating the great potential of social interactions and peer influence for behavioral change. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Attitude-behavior gap; Behavioral change; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Occupant behavior; Survey","Emission control; Energy utilization; Historic preservation; Housing; Office buildings; Sales; Surveys; Thermal insulation; Carbon emission reductions; Efficiency parameters; Energy policymaking; Energy saving potential; Energy-efficient products; Insulation performance; Residential building; Urban residential buildings; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101813953

Determining how the fertilization rate affects soil nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions under the RFRH system has important practical significance for improving fertilization strategies and evaluating the environmental effects of the RFRH system. Therefore, we conducted a three-year field experiment in the Loess Plateau, China, to compare the RFRH system with traditional flat planting (T) at four different fertilizer rates (no fertilizer, N:P2O5 at 150:75 kg ha–1, N:P2O5 at 300:150 kg ha–1, and N:P2O5 at 450:225 kg ha–1). Under the same fertilization level, the soil water content (SWC) and dry matter were higher under RFRH compared with T, and the nitrate nitrogen (NO3−-N) content and N2O emissions were reduced. In the two planting models, SWC and NO3−-N of each treatment and its corresponding N2O emission flux were significantly positively correlated. Under the same planting model, SWC decreased but NO3−-N and the N2O emission increased with increasing fertilization rate. SWC was the key variable affecting the N2O emission flux in the RFRH system. In addition, the grain yield under RFRH increased by 2.2–28.0%, whereas the global warming potential (GWP) and greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI) decreased by 1.0–16.1% and 13.0–56.8%, respectively, compared with T. The grain yield and GHGI had quadratic relationships with the fertilization rate. Moreover, GWP increased in a linear manner with the fertilizer rate. These findings suggest that the RFRH system is an effective tillage measure for reducing N2O emissions. When the N:P2O5 fertilization rate was 200:100 to 307:154 kg ha−1, the RFRH system could maintain a higher grain yield and reduce the N2O emissions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Environmental factors; Fertilization rate; Nitrous oxide; Ridge and furrow rainfall harvesting system; Semiarid region","Agriculture; Arid regions; Fertilizers; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Soil moisture; Springs (components); Fertilization rates; Fertilizer rates; Field experiment; Global warming potential; Nitrate nitrogen; Ridge and furrow; Soil water content; Water use efficiency; Rain; agrometeorology; fertilizer application; furrow irrigation; global warming; greenhouse gas; harvesting; maize; nitrous oxide; rainfall; semiarid region; water use efficiency; China; Loess Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101414157

Although previous studies estimated soil carbon (C) loss due to cropland expansion, other important environmental indicators, such as soil erosion and nutrient loss, remain largely unquantified. Here, we simulated the environmental impacts from the conversion of grassland to corn and soybeans for 12 US Midwestern states using the EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) model. Between 2008 and 2016, over 2 Mha of grassland were converted to crop production in these states, with much less cropland concomitantly abandoned or retired from production. The net grassland-cropland conversion increased annual soil erosion by 7.9%, nitrogen (N) loss by 3.7%, and soil organic carbon loss by 5.6% relative to that of existing cropland, despite an associated increase in cropland area of only 2.5%. Notably, the above estimates represent the scenario of converting unmanaged grassland to tilled corn and soybeans, and impacts varied depending upon crop type and tillage regime. Corn and soybeans are dominant biofuel feedstocks, yet the grassland conversion and subsequent environmental impacts simulated in this study are likely not attributable solely to biofuel-driven land use change since other factors also contribute to corn and soybean prices and land use decisions. Nevertheless, our results suggest grassland conversion in the Upper Midwest has resulted in substantial degradation of soil quality, with implications for air and water quality as well. Additional conservation measures are likely necessary to counterbalance the impacts, particularly in areas with high rates of grassland conversion (e.g. the Dakotas, southern Iowa). © 2021 The Author(s).

Copper slags, as for rich-iron species materials, are disposed of in landfills or open-air tailing ponds, which are another waste material that have not been effectively utilized for reuse application. In this study, strategy for sequence of phase-controlled and thermal-doped copper slag technique was used as the efficient means of minimization and stabilization of arsenic-bearing resides. Detailed results were showed that stepwise phase precipitation significantly reduced the formation of hazardous solid waste; the total solid waste was reduced 47.0 wt% because the gypsum was separated from arsenic calcium residues through two-step methods. Subsequently, solid waste stabilization was achieved by using thermal-doped slag, and the high yield of magnetite (75.6 wt%) and fayalite (22.7 wt%) was produced from copper slags. It was proved that these iron-rich species displayed the remarkable performance to stabilize arsenic due to the formation of Fe-As-Ca-O complex; compared with the raw solid waste, the arsenic leachability was decreased from 280.75 to 1.05 mg/L via copper slag stabilization process. The immobilized arsenic content was 25.0 wt%. Overall, the proposed strategy for stepwise phase-controlled and thermal-doped copper slags was a potentially effective strategy for reducing emissions and pollution of arsenic-containing wastewater and residue. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Arsenic-containing wastewater; Ferric arsenate; Heavy metal pollution; Leachability; Minimization process; Pollution control; Stabilization mechanism","arsenate; detection method; immobilization; magnetite; municipal solid waste; pollutant removal; slag; soil stabilization; solid waste; stabilization; waste disposal; wastewater; wastewater treatment; arsenic; copper; hazardous waste; solid waste; wastewater; Arsenic; Copper; Hazardous Waste; Solid Waste; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099062515

It is an important insulating part to realize electrical isolation between central conductor and grounding flange. In this paper, the insulation properties of the materials used for the basin insulator are analyzed experimentally, and the distribution of the electric field of the basin insulator is obtained through the electro-thermal coupling analysis process, and the relationship between the hottest spot temperature and the current carrying capacity is calculated. The heating curve of the basin insulator is obtained by using the theoretical model, and the basin insulation accident is analyzed by using the curve. Considering that the basin insulator is in the SF6 gas atmosphere for a long time, the local temperature rise caused by overheating fault of the basin insulator, and then the variation law of SF6 gas pressure and density caused by the overheating fault of the basin insulator are theoretically analyzed in this paper. Research shows: there is significant non-linear relationship between the insulation performance parameters of the basin body and the temperature. The eddy current field and harmonic field analysis method based on the finite element method can effectively calculate the heating of the center guide rod and the basin body under the power frequency condition. The maximum electric field intensity appears at the interface between the basin and the center conductor, with the value of 6.033kV/mm. The maximum temperature is near center conductor side of the basin, with value of 0.033kV/mm. When the current carrying capacity is higher than 1.5 times of the rated value, the thermal breakdown phenomenon of sudden temperature rise occurs. The calculation process of thermal electric coupling proposed in this paper provides way for verification of thermal electric performance of basin insulator design scheme, and also provides theoretical guidance for its on-site maintenance and accident analysis. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Atmospheric temperature; Density of gases; Eddy current testing; Electric fields; Electric grounding; Electric insulation; Sulfur hexafluoride; Thermal insulation; Electrical isolation; Electrothermal couplings; Hottest-spot temperatures; Insulation performance; Maximum electric field; Non-linear relationships; Theoretical modeling; Thermal electric couplings; SF6 insulation",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107948275

It is therefore necessary to model the market penetration of EVs and determine the role of EV adoption in future urban decarbonization scenarios. This study developed an integrated land use–transport–energy model to examine interactions between location choice, land use, transport patterns, energy profiles, and economy when implementing a stringent EV policy. Two scenarios were structured to investigate the long-term (to 2050) impacts of EV adoption on population distribution, land use patterns, transport demand, energy mix, emission profiles, and social welfare. Scenario simulations showed that ambitious market diffusion of EVs is likely to have significant positive effects on emission reduction in city centers, while economic benefits tend to occur in suburban areas, implying that EV adoption will play an important role in the spatial organization and structure of cities. The spatial heterogeneity of different urban zones requires more attention when evaluating the effectiveness of sustainable urban policies. Because disaggregated spatial interactions can be handled by the new integrated model, the methodology proposed here will be a useful tool for sustainable urban planning. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Electric vehicle; Emissions; Energy mix; Integrated urban model; Scenario simulation; Spatial disparity","Commerce; Decarbonization; Electric automobiles; Emission control; Land use; Urban planning; Attractive solutions; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Integrated modeling; Scenario simulations; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial interaction; Spatial organization; Vehicle penetration; Urban transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101766812

The construction activities inevitably cause a dramatic quantity of subway-related excavated soil and rock (ESR). How to manage it with minimal environmental impact on our urban ecosystem remains an open question. The present study evaluates global warming potential (GWP, expressed by CO2 eq) from different ESR recycling and landfilling scenarios via a life cycle assessment (LCA) model based on primary field investigation combined with the LCA software database. The study results illustrate that recycling ESR can significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In comparison with traditional construction materials, the scenarios found that a cumulative amount of 1.1 to 1.5 million tonnes (Mt) of CO2 eq emissions could have been mitigated by using ESR generated between 2010 and 2018 to produce baking-free bricks and recycled baked brick. Using cost–benefit analysis, potential economic benefits from recycled sand and baking-free bricks are found to reach US$9 million annually. The findings of this study could provide better recycling options for ESR-related stakeholders.

We investigated future changes in atmospheric circulation patterns associated with haze events in the Beijing region and the severity of haze events during these circulation conditions from 2015 to 2049 under two different aerosol scenarios: a maximum technically feasible aerosol reduction (MTFR) and a current legislation aerosol scenario (CLE). In both cases greenhouse gas emissions follow the Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5). Under RCP4.5 with CLE aerosol the frequency of circulation patterns associated with haze events increases due to a weakening of the East Asian winter monsoon via increased sea level pressure over the North Pacific. The rapid reduction in anthropogenic aerosol and precursor emissions in MTFR further increases the frequency of circulation patterns associated with haze events, due to further increases in the sea level pressure over the North Pacific and a reduction in the intensity of the Siberian high. Even with the aggressive aerosol reductions in MTFR periods of poor visibility, represented by above-normal aerosol optical depth (AOD), still occur in conjunction with haze-favorable atmospheric circulation. However, the winter mean intensity of poor visibility decreases in MTFR, so that haze events are less dangerous in this scenario by 2050 compared to CLE and relative to the current baseline. This study reveals the competing effects of aerosol emission reductions on future haze events through their direct contribution to pollutant source and their influence on the atmospheric circulation. A compound consideration of these two impacts should be taken in future policy making. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

These attribute primarily to the physical properties of steam as having high heat capacity to reduce local flame temperature, and hence reduce emissions by inhibiting the thermal NOx forward reaction rate. In this work, ultrahigh steam content with a steam-to-air mass ratio of up to 40% is premixed with methane–air mixture before entering into a swirl-stabilized high pressure (HP)-burner for combustion. A significant change of flame from V-shape (attached) to M shape (detached) is observed through a transparent combustion chamber whilst changing steam content. The measurement of chemiluminescence OH* is conducted with an intensified CCD-camera bandpass filtered at 320 nm. Following these measurements, large eddy simulation (LES) is used to capture reacting flow features. Reasonably well agreements between experimental data and numerical results are obtained for both attached and detached flames in terms of the OH* distribution. Slight inconsistency of OH* intensity is mainly due to uncollected wall temperature, which leads to either over- or underprediction of chemical reaction rate depending on the experimental flame positions. Distributed flame front is clearly identified with LES for wet methane combustion associated with 35% steam-to-air ratio corresponding to a high Karlovitz number flame. Slightly unstable combustion is observed when the steam-to-air ratio exceeds 40% featuring an onset of flame blow-off. In addition, interaction between precessing vortex core (PVC) and the flame is presented for different level of steam dilution, and conclusions are drawn regarding the flame stabilization. The in-depth understanding of the ultrawet combustion is an important step toward the use of sustainable, steam-diluted biosyngas for electricity production.

This study investigated whether the lockdown measures precipitated by the COVID-19 pandemic affected air pollutants in the short term. Moreover, we investigated the impact of the heterogeneity of cities and regions. Using city-level daily panel data for the 2018–2020 lunar calendar, we employed a two-way fixed effects model and interrupted time-series analysis to inspect the effects of the lockdown measures. Interesting empirical findings emerged from our analysis. First, compared with the base period from 2018 to 2019, the COVID-19 lockdown measures significantly reduced air pollutants. In 2020, compared to 2018, PM10 and SO2 dropped by 15.28 μg/m3 and 6.55 μg/m3, and compared to 2019, PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 declined by 7.4 μg/m3, 19.34 μg/m3, and 1.41 μg/m3, respectively.

The primary aim of this study was to introduce a biplot-based PCA approach to visualize and validate the correlation among indoor and outdoor air quality data. The Spearman coefficients showed a stronger correlation among these target environmental measurements on site 1 and site 2, while it showed a weaker correlation on site 3. The biplot-based PCA regression performed higher dependency for site 1 and site 2 (p &lt; 0.001) when compared to the correlation values and showed a lower dependency for site 3. The results displayed a mismatch between the biplot-based PCA and correlation analysis for site 3.

Over the past decades, China has made great efforts to retard the carbon emission growth. This paper aims to quantify the driving forces of stagewise provincial carbon emission changes and expound the bottom-up provincial efforts aligned with China’s carbon abatement targets. During 2007–2012, economic growth as the major contributing factor posed a great increase in provincial carbon emissions, especially in underdeveloped provinces such as Inner Mongolia, Anhui, Guangxi, Shaanxi, and Ningxia. During 2012–2017, the energy intensity effect replaced economic growth as the largest contributor to provincial carbon emission changes. In both two periods, industrial structure upgrading and renewable energy expansion are conducive to mitigate provincial carbon growth, and the power sector will continue to contribute to national decarbonization. Lastly, this paper provides insight into national and provincial carbon emission abatement. © 2021, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon emissions; China; LMDI; Provincial driving forces","abatement cost; alternative energy; carbon emission; economic growth; energy intensity; environmental economics; industrial structure; spatiotemporal analysis; China; carbon dioxide; China; economic development; industry; renewable energy; Carbon Dioxide; China; Economic Development; Industry; Renewable Energy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099065441

The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau has experienced remarkable warming and wetting since the mid-1990s. Its recent wetting alters thermal and hydrological properties in permafrost regions and inevitably affects permafrost thermal dynamics. While previous studies mostly focused on the effects of warming on permafrost, little attention has been paid to the effects of concomitant wetting. Here, a land surface model adapted for permafrost simulation is employed to quantitatively investigate the impacts of climate warming and wetting on permafrost thermal regimes by setting up a group of hypothetical numerical scenarios on the basis of historical meteorological records. The results reveal that climate wetting reduces permafrost thermal responses to warming and this effect is especially evident in the arid and semi-arid zones. It was estimated that one-degree warming induces an average increase of 0.46 m in active layer thickness (ATL) and 0.53 °C in temperature at the top of permafrost (TTOP), and a 100 mm wetting in summer precipitation leads to a mean decrease of 0.35 m in ALT and 0.36 °C in TTOP. Furthermore, we found through the simulations that increased summer precipitation imposes dual effects on permafrost in semi-arid high altitudes. © 2021 The Author(s)","climate wetting; numerical modeling; permafrost; Qinghai-Tibet Plateau; thermal regime","Arid regions; Climate models; Numerical models; Permafrost; Climate warming; Climate wetting; Climatic changes; Hydrological properties; Permafrost region; Qinghai Tibet plateau; Summer precipitation; Thermal; Thermal regimes; Thermal response; Wetting; climate effect; climate modeling; global warming; historical record; numerical model; permafrost; thermal regime; wetting; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102480291

This study introduces the concept of HSR accessibility and applies the generalized spatial two-stage least square method to examine the effect of HSR on haze pollution in China. A time-varying difference-in-difference strategy is then employed to recognize the causality from HSR to the haze pollution and eliminate endogeneity. Based on a panel dataset comprising 285 cities over 2010–2018, we find a negative effect of HSR accessibility on haze pollution. An increase of one standard deviation in HSR accessibility reduces PM2.5 concentration by 0.22%. However, the HSR pollution reduction effect varies significantly across cities. It is found that HSR can reduce haze pollution by improving the efficiency of resource allocation as well as promoting industrial structure change and technological innovation.

In this context, it is necessary to predict the long-term dynamics of China's carbon emissions. Existing research has investigated future scenarios for China's carbon emissions, but there is still no consensus on such issues as the amount of emissions at peak points and the future carbon emissions path over a longer period. This paper aimed to explore the dynamics of China's carbon emissions under five Shared Socioeconomic Pathways scenarios (SSP1–SSP5), and to provide further evidences for the comprehensive analysis and prediction of climate change. Before forecasting the socioeconomic data, an in-sample and out-of-sample approach was used to evaluate the prediction accuracy of the feasible generalized least squares (FGLS) model. By using historical data from 30 provinces, the relationship among population, educational attainment, per capita GDP, and carbon emissions was investigated. Finally, carbon emissions from 2018 to 2100 were predicted based on the settings of different SSP scenarios and model parameters. The results showed that the peak value was 2030 for SSP1 and SSP5, 2029 for SSP2 and SSP4, and 2028 for SSP3. China will reach the largest cumulative carbon emissions amounting to 814.84 billion tons under the SSP5 scenario. Under all the SSP scenarios, the western region was always the first to reach its peak value, followed by the central region and then the eastern coastal zone. From 2018 to 2100, Jiangsu, Shandong, Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan, Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Hebei, Hubei and Sichuan will contribute significantly to total carbon emissions under different SSP scenarios. All the results and conclusions would provide significant contributions for carbon reduction and climate change mitigation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emission; China; Forecasting; In-sample and out-of-sample approach; Shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPS)","Climate change; Energy utilization; Forecasting; Population statistics; Carbon reduction; Climate change mitigation; Comprehensive analysis; Educational attainments; Generalized least square; Long term dynamics; Prediction accuracy; Socio-economic data; Carbon; carbon; carbon emission; climate change; climate prediction; emission control; socioeconomic impact; air pollution control; Article; carbon footprint; China; climate change; controlled study; economic aspect; educational status; energy consumption; forecasting; geography; gross national product; prediction; shared socioeconomic pathway; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100417817

It helps to deepen our understanding of the air pollution formation process and develop productive environmental policies. Accurate PM2.5 source apportionment is more essential for small-scale local air pollution control. An integrated source apportionment approach was built by combining chemical mass balance (CMB) model and the Community Multiscale Air Quality modelling system (CMAQ) model to complement individual model and apportion PM2.5 pollution into more elaborate emission sources categories. The CMAQ source apportionment results of corresponding PM2.5 precursors were applied to assign secondary components while that of PM2.5 were applied to assign non-local sources as the basic constrains. An island city with typical secondary components in PM2.5 pollution was chosen. The results showed the dominant source impacts of non-local sources ranged from 31.07% in summer to 49.60% in winter. Compared to individual model, the integrated source apportionment approach preserved the accuracy of CMB modelling for primary sources, simultaneously apportioned the secondary components to the primary sources and abstracted non-local sources from primary sources, which acquired more elaborate results.

Embodied energy is the total direct and indirect energy consumption required for the production of goods and services. In the context of the intensifying development of economic globalization and prosperity of international trade, embodied energy is considered as a better indicator to comprehensively reflect the nature of a country’s energy use than the direct energy use. The development of trade in value added (TiVA) accounting and global value chain theory has brought new ideas to embodied energy research. This study applies TiVA accounting to the study of embodied energy and establishes a complete framework to decompose the sources, destinations, and transfer routes of embodied energy in a country’s exports, and comprehensively depicts the embodied energy flows in China’s exports at the country and sector levels as an instance. The results show that China exports large amounts of embodied domestic energy use, and export is an important factor for the rapid growth of China’s energy and emissions. At the country level, the United States and EU28 are traditional major importers of China, and developing countries, such as Brazil, India, and Indonesia, are emerging markets. China’s embodied energy flows to different importers vary in terms of trade patterns, flow routes, and the embodied domestic energy intensities. At the sector level, the light industry and the services create more benefits, whereas manufacturing, such as chemicals and metal products, consumes more energy, and there is a mismatch between the main sectors that create economic benefits from exports and the main sectors that consume energy for exports. These results indicate that embodied energy of China’s exports has a great impact on global energy consumption and carbon emission, and the optimizing of China’s export embodied energy structure is conducive to global energy conservation and emission reduction.

During the autotrophic remediation process, however, much remains to be illuminated about how complex syntrophic microbial communities couple Cr(VI) reduction with other elemental cycles. Two series of Cr(VI)-reducing groundwater bioreactors were independently amended by elemental sulfur and iron and inoculated with the same inoculum. After 160 days of incubation, both bioreactors showed similar archaea-dominating microbiota compositions, whereas a higher Cr(VI)-reducing rate and more methane production were detected in the Fe0-driven one. Metabolic reconstruction of 23 retrieved genomes revealed complex symbiotic relationships driving distinct elemental cycles coupled with Cr(VI) reduction in bioreactors. In both bioreactors, these Cr(VI) reducers were assumed to live in syntrophy with oxidizers of sulfur, iron, hydrogen, and volatile fatty acids and methane produced by carbon fixers and multitrophic methanogens, respectively. The significant difference in methane production was mainly due to the fact that the yielded sulfate greatly retarded acetoclastic methanogenesis in the S-bioreactor. These findings provide insights into mutualistic symbioses of carbon, sulfur, iron, and chromium metabolisms in groundwater systems and have implications for bioremediation of Cr(VI)-contaminated groundwater. ©",,"Bioconversion; Bioreactors; Bioremediation; Carbon; Groundwater; Groundwater pollution; Heavy metals; Iron; Metabolism; Methane; Microorganisms; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Volatile fatty acids; Contaminated groundwater; Hexavalent chromium; Metabolic reconstruction; Metal contaminants; Methane production; Microbial communities; Mutualistic symbiosis; Symbiotic relationship; Chromium compounds; carbon; chromium; chromium derivative; ground water; hydrogen; iron; methane; nitrogen; sulfur; volatile fatty acid; chromium hexavalent ion; ground water; chromium; concentration (composition); detection method; microbial activity; reduction; Actinobacteria; anaerobic metabolism; Article; autotrophy; Bacteroidetes; bioremediation; carbon fixation; chemical analysis; controlled study; DNA base composition; DNA extraction; DNA sequencing; Euryarchaeota; fatty acid oxidation; fermentation; genome; iron metabolism; methanogen; methanogenesis; microbial community; nitrogen metabolism; nonhuman; Proteobacteria; reduction (chemistry); spirochete; water pollutant; bioreactor; bioremediation; oxidation reduction reaction; Archaea; Microbiota; Biodegradation, Environmental; Bioreactors; Chromium; Groundwater; Oxidation-Reduction; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105067845

The present study uses an extended Spatial Durbin Model and county-level panel data to estimate the effectiveness of a pilot scheme of regional economic integration on land-use-related carbon emissions applied in the Wuhan metropolitan area. Intra-regional and spillover effects of urban development, the policy environment, and regional interactions are measured from 2001 to 2015, covering equal pre- and post-policy periods. The results suggest high potential for regional integration to reduce land-use-related carbon emissions. The levels of the carbon emissions in the 48 counties in the Wuhan metropolitan area are found to be spatially autocorrelated and exhibited clustering patterns. The regional economic linkages reveal a spatially gradual diffusion from the urban center to the periphery. The findings extend the relevant literature by showing that the status of the urban development of counties and the type of resource-exchange relations determine both the emissions reduction potential in a region and the direction of the economic and environmental spillover effects. The findings further point to a close linkage between the low-emission strategy, urban-migration plans, and the land-development policy, suggesting the need for a coordinated approach to define effective regionally specific policy instruments. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Carbon emissions; Land functional zones; Regional integration; Spatial Durbin model; Spillover effect; Wuhan metropolitan area","Carbon; Emission control; Integration; Land use; Regional planning; Sustainable development; Urban growth; Emissions reduction; Environment friendly; Metropolitan area; Policy instruments; Regional integration; Spatial Durbin models; Sustainability strategies; Urban development; Economics; carbon emission; economic integration; emission control; metropolitan area; pollution policy; regional economy; spatial analysis; spillover effect; China; Hubei; Wuhan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099783825

However, it remains unclear how animal grazing or its intensity affect nitrous oxide (N2 O) emissions, and the main driving factors. A grazing experiment including four grazing intensities (G0, G0.7, G1.2, G1.6 yak ha−1 ) was conducted between January 2013 and December 2014 to evaluate the soil nitrous oxide (N2 O) fluxes under different grazing intensities in an alpine meadow on the eastern Qinghai–Tibet Plateau of China. The N2 O fluxes were examined with gas collected by the static chamber method and by chromatographic concentration analysis. N2 O emissions in the growing seasons (from May to September) were lower than that in non-growing seasons (from October to April) in 2013, 1.94 ± 0.30 to 3.37 ± 0.56 kg N2 O ha−1 yr−1 . Annual mean N2 O emission rates were calculated as 1.17 ± 0.50 kg N2 O ha−1 yr−1 in non-grazing land (G0) and 1.94 ± 0.23 kg N2 O ha−1 yr−1 in the grazing land (G0.7, G1.2, and G1.6). The annual mean N2 O flux showed no significant differences between grazing treatments in 2013. However, there were significantly greater fluxes from the G0.7 treatment than from the G1.6 treatment in 2014, especially in the growing season. Over the two years, the soil N2 O emission rate was significantly negatively correlated with soil water-filled pore space (WFPS) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) content as well as positively correlated with soil available phosphorus (P). No relationship was observed between soil N2 O emission rate and temperature or rainfall. Our results showed that the meadow soils acted as a source of N2 O for most periods and turned into a weak sink of N2 O later during the sampling period. Our results highlight the importance of proper grazing intensity in reducing N2 O emissions from alpine meadow. The interaction between grazing intensity and N2 O emissions should be of more concern during future management of pastures in Zoige Plateau. © 2021 by the authors.

A model performance assessment was undertaken using observed data collected from five nested gauging sites in a mixed land use watershed of the central US. An integrated modeling approach was used to couple The Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT version 2012), and The Hydrologic Engineering Center's River Analysis System (HEC-RAS version 5.0.7). SWAT was used to generate effective rainfall needed to run HEC-RAS rain-on-grid two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations. Model calibration results showed the potential usefulness of coupling SWAT and HEC-RAS using an integrated modeling approach. For example, PBIAS of 8.3%, NSE value of 0.84, and coefficient of determination (R2) value of 0.80 at a highly urbanized monitoring site used for model calibration. Split-site validation results showed PBIAS values that ranged from 10.4 to 33.8%, NSE values that ranged from 0.33 to 0.92, and R2 values that ranged from 0.86 to 0.97. Results showed that 2D rain-on-grid HEC-RAS simulations can produce realistic simulations of stage hydrograph response when: (1) areal effective precipitation is used for 2D HEC-RAS rain-on-grid forcing's, (2) HEC-RAS is calibrated to observed data during the event of interest, (3) there are not substantial sources of backwatering from outside the models geometric data, and (4) during saturated antecedent soil moisture conditions surface DEM's adequately describe overland flow paths. This model performance assessment is among the first, if not the first, to show calibration and validation results associated with 2D HEC-RAS rain-on-grid simulations at a watershed scale. Results highlight the need for time-varying roughness coefficients to account for soil moisture conditions, and point to the efficacy of using a SWAT/HEC-RAS integrated modeling approach to generate event-based environmental flows information. © 2021","Environmental flows; HEC-RAS; Hydraulic modeling; Hydroecology; Hydrologic modeling; SWAT","rain; rain; environmental assessment; model validation; modeling; simulation; soil and water assessment tool; soil moisture; streamflow; aquatic biology; Article; calibration; climate change; environmental flow; environmental impact assessment; flow; geometry; human; human activities; hydroclimate; hydrodynamics; hydrography; hydrologic engineering centers river analysis system; hydrological model; land use; physical parameters; precipitation; roughness; simulation; Soil and Water Assessment Tool model; soil moisture; storm (weather); surface property; surface runoff; United States; urban area; validation study; water monitoring; water quality; watershed; environmental monitoring; hydrology; river; theoretical model; United States; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Hydrology; Models, Theoretical; Rain; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100711569

Experts consider different types of technologies as an opportunity to manage urbanization at the global level and predict the situation in the socio-economic and environmental spheres of life. On the other hand, the increasing risks on the planet from floods, hurricanes, fires and droughts force specialists to adapt to these changes, learn how to control them through new design technologies. Therefore, the emergence of the term ""urban management""is not accidental and is associated with a change in the perception of the level of sustainability of the environment, the comfort of living for people of different ages and social status in large cities. In this regard, the assessment and meaning of such well-known concepts as ""Sustainable City"", ""Green City"", ""Smart City""changes somewhat. Their content is filled with a new meaning if the technological aspect is added to the socio-economic and environmental aspects of sustainable development, as an independent concept associated with the restoration of the natural potential of cities by technological means. Therefore, the article will consider the problems of restoring nature and urbanized territories through the use of ecological technologies that simulate natural processes with different typological content: from the restoration of biotopes to the accumulation of rainwater in the body of the natural landscape. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Engineering education; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Restoration; Urban planning; Design technologies; Ecological technologies; Environmental aspects; Environmental sustainability; Natural landscapes; Natural potential; Sustainable cities; Technological aspects; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107223530

Low subtropical marine clouds can have a large effect on Earth s radiative budget, but they are poorly represented in global climate models. In order to understand their radiative effects, it is imperative to understand the composition and sources of the MBL cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). The campaign consisted of two intensive operation periods (IOPs) (June-July 2017 and January-February 2018) during which an instrumented G-1 aircraft was deployed from Lajes Field on Terceira Island in the Azores, Portugal. The G-1 conducted research flights in the vicinity of the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) Eastern North Atlantic (ENA) atmospheric observatory on Graciosa Island. An Aerodyne high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) and Ionicon protontransfer- reaction mass spectrometer (PTR-MS) were deployed aboard the aircraft, characterizing chemistry of nonrefractory aerosol and trace gases, respectively. The eastern North Atlantic region was found to be very clean, with an average non-refractory submicrometer aerosol mass loading of 0.6 gm-3 in the summer and 0.1 gm-3 in the winter, measured by the AMS. Average concentrations of the trace reactive gases methanol and acetone were 1-2 ppb; benzene, toluene and isoprene were even lower, < 1 ppb. Mass fractions of sulfate, organics, ammonium and nitrate in the boundary layer were 69 %, 23 %, 7% and 1% and remained largely similar between seasons. The aerosol chemical composition was dominated by sulfate and highly processed organics. Particulate methanesulfonic acid (MSA), a well-known secondary biogenic marine species, was detected, with an average boundary layer concentration of 0.021 gm-3, along with its gas-phase precursor, dimethyl sulfide (DMS). MSA accounted for no more than 3% of the submicron, non-refractory aerosol in the boundary layer. Examination of vertical profiles of aerosol and gas chemistry during ACE-ENA reveals an interplay of local marine emissions and long-range-transported aged aerosol. A case of transport of biomass burning emissions from North American fires has been identified using back-trajectory analysis. In the summer, the non-refractory portion of the background CCN budget was heavily influenced by aerosol associated with ocean productivity, in particular sulfate formed from DMS oxidation. Episodic transport from the continents, particularly of biomass burning aerosol, periodically increased CCN concentrations in the free troposphere. In the winter, with ocean productivity lower, CCN concentrations were overall much lower and dominated by remote transport.

Accurate calculations of the stocks and economic value of blue carbon in various plant communities can facilitate vegetation rehabilitation. Based on this objective, first, a blue carbon estimation model was constructed by combining a Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA) model, and second, the distribution pattern of blue carbon and flow direction of ecosystem services (carbon sequestration) in a coastal wetland in China was analyzed utilizing a combination of field surveys, remote sensing data, and laboratory analysis techniques. Finally, the wetland carbon sequestration value and its income-expenditure status were measured using the carbon tax method. The results show that the aboveground net primary productivity of coastal wetland vegetation exhibits a non-zonal distribution in the south-north direction, whereas it presented a three-level gradient distribution, characterized as “low (200–300 g/m2·y)–intermediate (300–400 g/m2·y)–high (400–500 g/m2·y)”, in the east-west direction. The accumulation of carbon gradually increased from the ground surface to the underground (litter &lt; underground roots &lt; soil) in Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis. On the type scale, Spartina alterniflora and Phragmites australis wetlands were of the “blue carbon” net outflow type (supply type), with mean annual outflow carbon sequestration values of 3272.3 $/ha and 40.9 $/ha, respectively. The Suaeda glauca wetland was of the “blue carbon” net inflow type (benefit type), with a mean annual inflow carbon sequestration value of 190.7 $/ha. © 2021 by the author.

Moreover, the fluctuation of fuel prices is a primary concern faced by many countries that highly rely on conventional power generation to meet the load demand. Hence, the need to use alternative resources, such as renewable energy, is crucial in order to mitigate fossil fuel dependency, while ensuring reductions in carbon dioxide emissions. Algeria—being the largest county in Africa—has experienced a rapid growth in energy demand over the past decade due to the significant increase in residential, commercial, and industry sectors. Currently, the hydrocarbon-rich nation is highly dependent on fossil fuels for electricity generation, with renewable energy only having a small contribution to the country’s energy mix. However, the country has massive potential for renewable energy generation, such as solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, and hydropower. Therefore, the government aims to diversify away from fossil fuels and promote renewable energy generation through policies and renewable energy-related programs. The country’s Renewable Energy and Energy Efficiency Development Plan focuses on large scale solar, wind generation as well as geothermal and biomass technologies. This paper provides an update on the current energy position and renewable energy status in Algeria. Moreover, this paper discusses renewable energy (RE) policies and programs that aim to increase the country’s renewable energy generation and its implementation status. © 2021 by the authors.

The goal of this research is to increase the possibility of using renewable energy available in the country and reduce the dependence on fossil fuels. The data used for the analysis is obtained from remote sensing satellites and weather stations located across the country's coastal regions. A multi-criteria decision model is built to perform geographic and technical analysis of the study area. This research reveals locations suitable for wind turbine installations. The results of this study aid the transition to wind energy with its optimal adaptation in Tunisia. Only 7% of Tunisian offshore territory is found fit for the deployment of fixed-bottom wind farms. Six locations, in particular, were chosen in the Gulf of Tunisia, Gabes, Sousse, Sfax, Bizerte, and Djerba. The GIS-based methodology proposed in this paper can be applied to other offshore wind farm allocation investigations. The environmental impact of proposed wind farms on GHG reduction and employment opportunities are investigated. The suggested wind farms will reduce the GHG emissions and the energy price in Tunisia as well as create new jobs for society. © 2021 IEEE.","Annual Energy Produced (AEP); Geographic Information System (GIS); Greenhouse Gas (GHG); Offshore wind farm; Renewable Energy Sources (RES)","Electric utilities; Environmental impact; Fossil fuel power plants; Fossil fuels; Greenhouse gases; Offshore oil well production; Offshore power plants; Remote sensing; Weather satellites; Employment opportunities; Multicriteria decision; Off-shore wind energy; Offshore wind power plants; Remote sensing satellites; Renewable energies; Technical analysis; Turbine installation; Offshore wind farms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113318453

Although a common framework is used, each ecosystem has its own characteristics. The agroecosystem, for example, is an anthropised ecosystem where ecosystem service flows are highly interrelated with the environment, positively or negatively. Therefore, agroecosystem services are usually accompanied by disservices. The valuation of agroecosystem services and disservices requires adaptation of existing ecosystem services paradigms to accommodate the innate agroecosystem idiosyncrasies. To this end, in this study, a comprehensive approach for valuation of agroecosystem services and disservices was proposed and validated in a semi-arid western Mediterranean agricultural area through stakeholder assessment, using a choice experiment. The results suggest that all categories of services (provisioning, regulating, and cultural) should be taken into account when valuing agroecosystem services and disservices. In particular, food provision (a provisioning service), water (a provisioning disservice), local climate regulation and biodiversity (regulating services), waste treatment and water purification (regulating disservices), and recreation and tourism (cultural services) are relevant for this purpose. Their relative importance in agroecosystems valuation reached 70% for agroecosystem services and 30% for disservices. Specifically, biodiversity (38%) emerged as the most relevant agroecosystem service to be valued, followed by recreation and tourism (20%), local climate regulation (7%), and food provision (5%). Among the agroecosystem disservices, water and waste treatment (15%), and water purification (15%) together contributed to 30% of the total importance. Agroecosystems should be valued considering their multifunctional character and the integration of agroecosystem services and disservices. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Anthropised ecosystems; Choice experiment; Human well-being; Mediterranean agroecosystems; Stakeholder assessment","Agricultural robots; Biodiversity; Purification; Tourism; Waste treatment; Water treatment; Water treatment plants; Agricultural areas; Agro ecosystems; Choice experiments; Ecosystem management; Ecosystem services; Valuation of ecosystem services; Water purification; Western Mediterranean; Ecosystems; agricultural ecosystem; anthropogenic effect; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; experiment; quality of life; stakeholder; valuation; agroecosystem; agroecosystem disservice; agroecosystem service; air quality; Article; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; controlled study; environmental sustainability; fertilizer application; food security; human; priority journal; questionnaire; rural area; social status; thermodynamics; validation study; waste management; water management; water pollution; wellbeing; Mediterranean Region",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099152706

The scientific case for action has been accepted by nearly all governments, at national and local or state level. Yet in all legislatures, there is a gap between the stated climate ambitions and the implementation of the measures necessary to achieve them. This paper examines this gap by analysing the experience of the following three UK cities: Belfast, Edinburgh, and Leeds. Researchers worked with city officials and elected representatives, using interviews and deliberative workshops to develop their shared understandings. The study finds that local actors employ different strategies to respond to the stated climate emergency, based on their innate understanding, or ‘phronetic knowledge’, of what works. It concludes that rapid climate action depends not just on the structures and mechanisms of governance, but at a deeper level, the assumptions, motivations and applied knowledge of decision-makers. © 2021 by the authors.

The multidimensional impacts of urbanization on EEE were evaluated using a hybrid approach that combined a super slack-based measure (SBM) model with a stochastic impacts by regression on population, affluence, and technology (STIRPAT) model. This approach was applied to evaluate the influences of multi-dimension urbanization on EEE, taking account of undesirable outputs from environmental pollution. The appropriateness of the approach was verified using panel data of 21 cities in Guangdong Province from 2005 to 2016. The results indicated there existed obvious regional differences in the indexes of urbanization and EEE in Guangdong Province during this period. Further analysis of the multidimensional impacts of urbanization revealed that two factors (i.e., proportion of the urban resident population and urban compactness) had significant positive impacts on EEE. Conversely, the impacts of the following three factors on EEE were significant negative: (1) per capita GDP, (2) contribution of the secondary industry, and (3) proportion of land used for urban construction. Some factors (e.g., population size and urban built-up area) did not have significant effects on EEE in Guangdong Province. These findings indicated that decision makers in Guangdong Province could consider the positive influences of the population urbanization and the negative influences of the land urbanization on EEE. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Energy-environmental efficiency; Guangdong Province; Panel data; STIRPAT model; Super slack-based measure model; Urbanization","Decision making; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Population statistics; Stochastic models; Urban growth; Energy; Energy-environmental efficiency; Energy-saving and emission reductions; Environmental efficiency; Guangdong Province; Multi dimensions; Panel data; Stochastic impact by regression on population, affluence, and technology model; Super slack-based measure model; Urbanization; Stochastic systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102235983

Quantification of connections, synergies, and tradeoffs across these subsystems is needed in a more integrated and comprehensive manner, which is challenging due to the complexities and uncertainties involved therein. This paper proposed an inexact optimization approach from a novel water-food-energy-climate change-land (WORLD) nexus perspective, which has potential to promote social-economic development, guarantee livelihood security, and achieve low-carbon target. The approach is capable of (1) helping decision makers identify optimal policy alternatives among water, land, and energy, balancing economic benefit, water supply guarantee rate, hydroelectric generation, water-land utilization, crop yield, and greenhouse gas emission, via a multi-objective non-linear optimization model; (2) providing decision makers insights into in-depth analysis of optimal water-land resources allocation strategies associated with different levels of water supply, optimistic-pessimistic attitude, and climate change and where the effort could be made towards regional sustainability; (3) dealing with fuzzy uncertainties simultaneously occurring in objective functions and constraints as well as tracking fluctuating attitudes of decision-makers. The effectiveness of proposed model was verified in a real-world case in Zhanghe Irrigation District, Hubei Province, China. The changing range of economic benefit, crop yield, energy production, and environmental impacts were obtained based on optimal water-land resources allocation under different confidence levels and risk attitudes. Results under climate change scenarios show that climate change exacerbated local water shortage, especially in RCP 8.5, which requires 4.24 × 108 m3 of compensatory external water. Results also show that CO2 emission contributed 94.9% of GHGs emission, while fertilizers application contributed to 58% of total CO2 emission amount, calling for effective fertilizer utilization management. Compared with single objective models, proposed model performs better on providing coordinated policy solutions. The proposed approach can help manage resources in WORLD nexus system in a sustainable way, and is portable to other similar regions to promote sustainable development. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Me-measure fuzzy chance-constrained programming; Multi-objective modelling; Sustainability; Uncertainty; Water-food-energy-climate change-land nexus","Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Crops; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Fertilizers; Greenhouse gases; Nonlinear programming; Resource allocation; Sustainable development; Uncertainty analysis; Water resources; Water supply; Climate change scenarios; Fuzzy uncertainties; Hydroelectric generation; Inexact optimization; Irrigation districts; Non-linear optimization; Regional sustainability; Single objective models; Climate change; climate change; decision making; modeling; public attitude; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; sustainability; sustainable development; China; Hubei",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095604716

In this study, we conducted an air pollution exposure assessment by scrutinizing one-hour resolution population distribution maps derived from hourly smartphone data and air pollutant concentrations derived from inverse distance weighted interpolation. We selected Wuhan as the study area and used Pearson correlation analysis to explore the effect of compactness on population-weighted concentrations. The results showed that even if a compact urban form helps to reduce pollution concentrations by decreasing vehicle traveling miles and tailpipe emissions, higher levels of building density and floor area ratios may increase population-weighted exposure. With regard to downtown areas with high population density, compact development may locate more people in areas with excessive air pollution. In all, reducing density in urban public centers and developing a polycentric urban structure may aid in the improvement of air quality in cities with compact urban forms. © 2021 by the authors.

Under the requirements of the national policy of regional green development, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region needs to shift to a low-carbon development mode to achieve regional emission reduction targets. The varying characteristics of industrial carbon emissions resulting from differences in the industrial development and resource endowment of each city make it difficult to implement the same emission reduction policy, so different cities need to be treated differently. Based on data from three provinces and eight cities in the region from 2002 to 2016, this study used the multi-regional (M-R) spatial decomposition method to compare the carbon emissions and the effects of their influencing factors in each city, so as to provide a targeted emission reduction policy for each city. The estimation results revealed that carbon emissions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region peaked in 2012, and energy intensity and population size are the main reasons for the differences in carbon emissions at the provincial level. At the city level, Tangshan, Handan and Shijiazhuang are high carbon emission cities, while Hengshui, Baoding, Langfang, Qinhuangdao and Xingtai are low carbon emission cities. The total amount of carbon emission in all industries in Tangshan ranks the first, and economic scale and energy intensity are the main reasons for the high carbon emissions in its manufacturing and transportation sectors. Energy intensity and energy structure are the main reason why the carbon emission of Handan is higher than that of Baoding, a city with the same economic level. Shijiazhuang has high energy efficiency, but its economic development and carbon emissions have not yet been decoupled. Hengshui's high energy intensity is an obstacle to emission reductions in all industries. Xingtai's energy structure contributes to carbon emission reduction. The current industrial structures of Qinhuangdao, Langfang, and Shijiazhuang may help these cities reduce emissions.

Ferroelectric polarization within SrBi2Nb2O9 nanosheets provides an in-built electric field, which greatly facilitates the bulk charge separation. Also, the photogenerated electrons and holes migrate separately to the NbO6 octahedral layers and within the ab-plane in the Bi2O2 layers, achieving efficient anisotropic charge migration. Without co-catalyst or sacrificial agent, SrBi2Nb2O9 nanosheets show outstanding CO2 reduction activity in producing CH4. The ferroelectric polarization is further enhanced by electric poling and annealing post-treatments.

For this reason, greenhouses have grown significantly and this occurrence needs more energy supply. On the other hand, due to environmental pollution and Carbon Dioxide emission which is one of the most obvious reasons of global warming, the use of fossil fuels is not a safe method and due to environmental compatibility and renewability of renewable energies, the use of these resources is one of the best energy-supplying options for a sustainable development. Wind energy is one of the most common renewable resources and Iran has a suitable wind potential. In this research, 100 kW of renewable electricity in the Pakdasht greenhouses was supplied and evaluated by three wind turbines with different power generation diagrams. In this case, in order to supplying electricity during peak consumption, turbine-generated electricity replaced with the diesel generator system and power outage was sold to the grid. Finally, the results showed that Eocycle WT is the most suitable option in this city due to the greater conformity of this turbine power curves with the intensity and pattern of the wind blowing in this city.

Box U19, Charles Darwin University, Darwin, NT  0815, Australia","Satellite-derived phenology (or apparent phenology) is frequently used to illustrate changes in plant phenology (i.e. true phenology) and the effects of climate forcing. However, each study uses a different method to detect phenology. Plant phenology refers to the relationship between the life cycle of plants and weather and climate events. Phenology is often studied in the field, but recently studies have transitioned towards using satellite images to monitor phenology at the plot, country, and continental scales. The problem with this approach is that there is an ever-increasing variety of earth observation satellites collecting data with different spatial, spectral, and temporal characteristics. In this paper we ask if studies that detect phenology using different sensors over the same site produce comparable results. Mangrove forests are one example where different methods have been used to examine their apparent phenology. In general, plant phenology, including mangroves, is described using few individual plants, but continental-scale descriptions of phenological events are scarce or inexistent. Few attempts have been made to describe the phenology of mangroves using satellite imagery, and each study presents a different method. We hypothesize that apparent phenology changes with: 1) areal extent; 2) site location; 3) frequency of observation; 4) spatial resolution; 5) temporal coverage; and 6) the number of cloud contaminated observations. Intuitively, one would assume that these hypotheses hold true, yet few studies have investigated this. For example, one would expect that clouds change the observed phenology of vegetation, that the number of species captured at spatial resolution will impact the apparent phenology, or that mangroves in different places display different phenologies, but how are these changes represented in the apparent phenology? We use the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) to examine the changes in the start of season and peak growing season dates, as well as the shape and amplitude of the apparent phenology in each hypothesis. We use Landsat and Sentinel 2 imagery over the mangrove forests in Darwin Harbour (Northern Territory, Australia) as a case study, and found that apparent phenology does change with the sensor, site, and cloud contamination. Importantly, the apparent phenology is comparable between Landsat and Sentinel 2 sensors, but it is not comparable to phenology derived from MODIS. This is due to differences in the spatial resolution of the sensors. Cloud contamination also significantly changes the apparent phenology of vegetation. In this paper we expose the complexity of modelling phenology with remote sensing and help guide future phenology investigations. © 2020 The Author(s)","Apparent phenology; Generalized additive models; Landsat; Mangroves; Phenology; Sentinel 2; Time series analysis","Rhizophoraceae; Satellites; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107356677

We analyzed changes in the concentration of particulate matter (PM) and the number of high PM pollution days for 10 years after the GB was implemented, using the National Atmospheric Environmental Research Stations 2001–2018 dataset. We also performed field measurements of PM10 and PM2.5 from February 2018 to January 2019 to analyze the PM concentrations at human breathing height throughout the GB. Before GB implementation (2001–2006), PM10 in the RA was 9% higher than that in the IC. After GB zone implementation (2013–2018), PM10 in the RA was 11% lower than that of the IC. Furthermore, the PM concentration in the RA (slope = ∆Concentration/∆Time, −2.09) rapidly decreased compared to that in the IC (slope = −1.02) and the western coastal area (WCA) (slope = −1.55) over the 10-year period. At PM concentrations at human breathing height, PM10 and PM2.5 in the RA were lower than those in the IC by 27% and 26%, respectively. After GB implementation, the wind speed was positively correlated but SOx was negatively correlated with the PM reduction rate at a local scale. These results show that there was a reduction of PM during and after GB implementation, implying the need for proper management of GBs and continuous measure of pollutant sources at the green buffers of industrial complexes. © 2021 by the authors.

The modified CMAQ gas and aerosol mechanisms represent the same species emitted at different times as an age-resolved mixture, using multiple age-tagged variables and a dynamic age-bin advancing scheme. The model was applied to study the spatial and temporal evolution of τ for PPM and NSA in January 2013 to understand the formation and regional transport of PM and the precursor gases during severe winter pollution episodes in China. The results showed that increases in PPM and NSA concentrations during high pollution periods in polluted urban areas were typically associated with increases in the mean atmospheric age (τ¯) due to the accumulation of local emissions and regional transport of aged pollutants. Some of the rapid sulfate growth events at the beginning of multiday air pollution episodes were driven by regional transport of aged particles. In heavily polluted cities, while most of the monthly average PPM had τ less than 10 h, more than half of the sulfate had τ greater than 20-30 h. Regional distributions showed that very aged sulfate particles with τ > 96 h accounted for a significant portion of the total sulfate and had a very broad spatial distribution. However, aged ammonium ions had very low concentrations. Aged nitrate also had lower concentrations and more limited spatial distributions than sulfate due to differences in the atmospheric lifetime between SO2 and NOx. The estimated NOx lifetime of approximately '24 h in China agrees with a satellite-based estimation of 21 h. Potential applications of the age distribution analysis include evaluating the impacts of meteorology on air quality and developing short-term emission control strategies. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

It is of vital importance to formulate optimal management strategies for decision-makers by considering conflicting objectives among system cost and environmental risk under complex uncertainties. In this study, an inexact two-stage multi-objective planning (ITMOP) model is proposed for supporting municipal solid waste (MSW) management. This model advanced existing optimization methods through integrating interval linear programming and two-stage stochastic programming within the multi-objective programming framework, where various uncertainties expressed as interval value and probability distributions were effectively reflected. The environmental risks associated with exhaust gas and leachate emission from incineration and landfill are quantitively assessed. The economic performance of these two waste disposal facilities is evaluated through the introduction of different energy recovery and subsidy policy scenarios. The ITMOP-based municipal solid waste management model is applied to a case study of MSW management planning in the Baotou city of China. Ten scenarios integrated with different economic incentives are designed for analyzing the optimized solutions. The generated waste flow allocation pattern and facility expansion capacity results provide scientific waste management strategies for local authorities. Moreover, the obtained total system cost and environmental risks under different scenarios can help policymakers resolve eco-economic conflicts according to their preferences. Waste incineration will gradually replace landfilling as the mainstream of waste treatment in the future. Revenues from energy recovery and financial subsidies for incineration can compensate for its high economic cost and promote waste resource utilization. The results indicate that the local government can use the subsidy policy to encourage waste disposal to proper facilities and simultaneously reduce environmental emissions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Economic performance; Environmental risks; Solid waste management; Subsidy policy; Uncertainty","Costs; Economics; Land fill; Multiobjective optimization; Probability distributions; Public policy; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Case-studies; Economic performance; Energy recovery; Environmental risks; Municipal solid waste management; Solid waste management; Subsidy policy; System costs; Uncertainty; Waste management planning; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103588321

The suppressed N2O emissions had a positive relationship with the activity ratios of nitrite/NO reductases and N2O reductase, and were expected to be caused by the inhibited heterotrophic denitrification process. The inhibition of glucose metabolism key enzymes and electron transport chain activities would be responsible for the heterotrophic denitrification performances deterioration.

Various types of emissions caused by people's actions, such as transportation, power, and fuel use, are affecting air quality. The machine learning in its components has become the key focus areas of all companies from the early stage of startups to major platform vendors. Machine learning is a field in which an artificial intelligence device collects sensor data and learns to act. One of those factors, the proposed research work has chosen to learn and forecast the air quality index with the opportunity to adapt to the machine learning algorithms. Air Quality Index is a device used for determining the air quality and the causes of air pollution. Air pollution is widely regarded as a concern in India. The highest possible values that are considered fit for public medical services are relatively higher than the daily air quality quantified attributes. The situation is particularly bad in larger cities like Delhi, where the AQI has reached an all-time high of 999. A few of the air pollution control processes are carried out by the federal government and state governments. Many researchers implement some of the algorithms we use, but none of them compares their performance across all six algorithms in a single study under similar conditions and using the same data. This paper portrays different strategies followed in forecasting the Air Quality Index using supervised machine learning procedures. The supervised machine learning technique (SMLT) was used to analyze a dataset and capture multiple pieces of information, including variable recognition, uni-variate analysis, bi-variate and multivariate analysis, missing value treatments, and data analysis. Moreover, the Estimation of the air quality index can be accomplished based on pollutants causing effect viz., PM10, PM2.5, SO2, CO, and NO2. These are the components used in supervised machine learning procedureres to compare the air quality of an environment. The main goal is to create a machine learning model and investigate the air quality index by predicting the best results from various machine learning algorithms based on their precision. We used logistic regression, decision tree, support vector machine, random forest tree, Nave Bayes theorem, and K-nearest neighbor as six basic machine learning algorithms. © 2021 IEEE.","03; Air pollution; Air Quality Index; CO; Decision tree; K-nearest neighbor; Logistic regression; Machine learning; Naïve Bayes; NO2; PM10; PM2.5; Random forest tree; SO2; Support vector machine","Air pollution control; Air quality; Control systems; Decision trees; Forecasting; Intelligent computing; Learning systems; Logistic regression; Multivariant analysis; Nearest neighbor search; Population statistics; Predictive analytics; Quality assurance; Sulfur dioxide; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Turing machines; Air quality indices; Federal governments; K-nearest neighbors; Machine learning models; Metropolitan cities; Multi variate analysis; Population densities; Supervised machine learning; Learning algorithms",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107539244

Due to conventional technologies, the environment has been degraded seriously, which profoundly impacts life on earth. To reduce the emissions caused by running the compression ignition engines, waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel is one of the best alternative fuels locally available in all parts of the world. Different study results are reviewed with a clear focus on combustion, performance, and emission characteristics, and the impact on engine durability. Moreover, the environmental and economic impacts are also reviewed in this study. When determining the combustion characteristics of WCO biodiesel, the cylinder peak pressure value increases and the heat release rate and ignition delay period decreases. In performance characteristics, brake-specific fuel consumption increases while brake-specific energy consumption, brake power, and torque decrease. WCO biodiesel cuts down the emissions value by 85% due to decreased hydrocarbon, SO2, CO, and smoke emissions in the exhaust that will effectively save the environment. However, CO2 and NOx generally increase when compared to diesel. The overall economic impact of production on the utilization of this resource is also elaborated. The results show that the use of WCO biodiesel is technically, economically, environmentally, and tribologically appropriate for any diesel engine. © 2021 by the authors.

We found that, in summer, emissions of anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and NOx decreased yearly in Handan, but the O3 concentration significantly declined yearly during 2013–2015, whereas it expe-rienced worsening O3 pollution after 2015. Therefore, we used the Weather Research and Forecasting Community Multiscale Air Quality (WRF–CMAQ) modeling system to simulate the influence of the meteorological conditions and emission changes in Handan during the typical period (June) of O3 pollution in 2013–2018. For benchmarked June 2013, the results showed that the reduction of the O3 concentration in June of 2014–2016 was mainly caused by emission reduction, while in June of 2017–2018, the combined effect of changes in emissions and meteorological conditions led to aggravated O3 pollution. Sensitivity analysis indicated that combined VOCs and NOx emission controls would effectively reduce incremental O3 formation when the abatement ratio of VOCs/NOx should be no less than 0.84, and we found that VOCs reduction would continusouly bring about O3 decreases under various NOx reductions, but its positive sensitivity to O3 would become smaller with NOx reduction. However, the positive influence of NOx reduction on O3 would happen until NOx reduction exceeding 45–60%. The findings will be helpful in formulating emission control strategies for coping with O3 pollution in an industrial city. © 2021 by the authors.

Among them, 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (TMB), mainly emitted from solvent use, is one of the most important secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors. Although atmospheric SO2 and NH3 levels can affect secondary aerosol formation, the influenced extent of their impact and their detailed driving mechanisms are not well understood. The focus of the present study is to examine the chemical compositions and formation mechanisms of SOA from TMB photooxidation influenced by SO2 and/or NH3. Here, we show that SO2 emission could considerably enhance aerosol particle formation due to SO2-induced sulfate generation and acid-catalyzed heterogeneous reactions. Orbitrap mass spectrometry measurements revealed the generation of not only typical TMB products but also hitherto unidentified organosulfates (OSs) in SO2-added experiments. The OSs designated as being of unknown origin in earlier field measurements were also detected in TMB SOA, indicating that atmospheric OSs might also be originated from TMB photooxidation. For NH3- involved experiments, results demonstrated a positive correlation between NH3 levels and particle volume as well as number concentrations. The effects of NH3 on SOA composition were slight under SO2- free conditions but stronger in the presence of SO2. A series of multifunctional products with carbonyl, alcohols, and nitrate functional groups were tentatively characterized in NH3-involved experiments based on infrared spectra and mass spectrometry analysis. Plausible formation pathways were proposed for detected products in the particle phase. The volatility distributions of products, estimated using parameterization methods, suggested that the detected products gradually condense onto the nucleation particles to contribute to aerosol formation and growth. Our results suggest that strict control of SO2 and NH3 emissions might remarkably reduce organosulfates and secondary aerosol burden in the atmosphere. Updating the aromatic oxidation mechanism in models could result in more accurate treatment of particle formation for urban regions with considerable SO2, NH3, and aromatics emissions. © 2021 Zhaomin Yang et al.",,"aerosol; ammonia; aromatic hydrocarbon; concentration (composition); organometallic compound; particulate matter; photooxidation; sulfur dioxide; volatile organic compound",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106955980

Ten indicators are used to measure the extreme temperature, including extreme heat and extreme cold. Meanwhile, both the geographical and climatic factors and the economic factors are considered to control the model. The results show that CO2 emissions have significant effect on extreme weather changes. An increase in emissions leads to an increase in the probability of extreme heatby 0.00843 and a decrease in the probability of extreme cold by 0.00737. Considering the spatial effects, CO2 emissions increased the probability of extreme heat in local city and decreased that in nearby cities, while CO2 emissions decreased the ratio of extreme cold in both local city and neighboring cities.

The uptake of CH4 and CO2 by polyethylene generally increased with increasing pressure and decreasing temperature. However, at high pressures, for example, the uptake of methane by polyethylene increases with temperature. The self-diffusion coefficients of methane and carbon dioxide generally increase with pressure. These results are, in general, consistent with the swelling behavior of the polymer. Interestingly, for the penetrants, the activation barrier of diffusion decreases with pressure. MD simulations are also carried out for the CH4/CO2 mixture in amorphous polyethylene. Here, the overall sorption and transport properties were similar to those reported for pure CH4 and pure CO2 in polyethylene. The sorption selectivity of CO2/CH4 decreases with increasing pressure and temperature and was mostly independent of the bulk mole fraction of methane. Importantly, at high pressures, the mobility of methane found here is higher than that of the corresponding pure methane in polyethylene and the opposite trend is observed in the case of carbon dioxide. These results might be due to the fact that the swelling of the polymer in the presence of carbon dioxide is significantly higher than that in the presence of methane, especially at high pressures. The diffusion and membrane selectivities of carbon dioxide/methane show a similar trend to the sorption selectivity data. Furthermore, the simulation data were in good agreement with the theoretical calculations based on the PC-SAFT equation of state. ©",,"Diffusion in liquids; Equations of state; Methane; Mixtures; Molecular dynamics; Polyethylenes; Sorption; Transport properties; Activation barriers; Amorphous polyethylenes; Membrane selectivity; Molecular dynamics simulations; Pressure and temperature; Self-diffusion coefficients; Sorption selectivity; Theoretical calculations; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106501540

Determining the optimal power and capacity allocation is an urgent problem in the planning and construction stages of hybrid systems. This study focused on exploring a universal method for determining the power reallocation and capacity configuration for a grid-connected PV power station integrated hydrogen production system. First, considering the PV output characteristics and electricity transmission requirements, a model for determining the grid connection dispatch with the objective of minimizing PV curtailment was constructed. The operational control strategies of the hydrogen system considering the hydrogen production process under different storage configurations were proposed. Then, an optimal capacity decision method considering grid connection modes, hydrogen storage, and transportation modes, and hydrogen transportation distance was formed. Finally, a case study on the 100 MW PV demonstration base in the Qinghai province of China was used to confirm their feasibility. The results indicated that: (1) the liquid hydrogen is more suitable for long-distance transportation, and the 5-segment mode is best for grid connection; (2) the optimal capacity configurations for the hydrogen production system under the 5-segment grid connection mode were three sets of 800 Nm3/hr electrolyzers and 3 MW of the liquefier; and (3) when the transportation distance is 3000 km, the net present value (NPV) of the entire life cycle is $15.85 million, which is about four times that of the PV demonstration base only for grid connection ($3.83 million), and the annual hydrogen output is 7.01 million Nm3, which can reduce CO2 emissions by 7.72 thousand tons. Thus, the method has important guiding significance for reducing carbon dioxide emissions and realizing cleaner production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Capacity configuration; Grid connection mode; Hydrogen storage and transportation; Photovoltaic-hydrogen system; Power reallocation","Carbon dioxide; Electric power transmission networks; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Hybrid systems; Hydrogen production; Life cycle; Photovoltaic cells; Pollution control; Capacity configuration; Cleaner production; Grid connection mode; Grid connections; Grid-connected; Hydrogen storage and transportation; Photovoltaic power stations; Photovoltaic-hydrogen system; Photovoltaics; Power reallocation; Hydrogen storage",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103560690

Our previous studies found that reductive dechlorination of organochlorine pollutants is usually accompanied by methanogenesis in flooded paddy soil. Here, taking a typical organochlorine pesticide hexachlorocyclohexane isomers lindane (γ-HCH), as an example disturbance, we artificially manipulated the soil microbiome by inoculating irradiated-sterile soil with a serially diluted soil suspension to address the impact of microbial diversity loss on both γ-HCH degradation and methanogenesis. The presence of γ-HCH delayed methanogenesis in all treatments but methanogenesis with increasing dilution levels showed increasing performance. Dilution had little negative effect on the degradation rate of γ-HCH. Dilution intensified the coupling between γ-HCH degradation and methanogenesis, as evidenced by co-occurrence network and RDA analysis. Relative functional redundancy index (rFRI), community assembly, community structure and functional diversity were all significantly affected by dilution, with the bacterial community showing a greater divergence than archaea. Null model analyses suggest the relative contribution of stochastic process increased in bacterial community re-assembly with dilution but decreased in archaea. Intensified coupling between methanogenesis and dechlorination was related to specific microbial taxa. The loss of soil microbial diversity could have an important impact on specialized soil functions such as pollution remediation and greenhouse gas emission, with function restoration regulated by the competitive and synergistically-mediated mechanism of co-occurring microorganisms and assembly processes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Community assembly; Functional redundancy; Loss of microbial diversity; Methanogenesis; Paddy soil; γ-HCH","Bacteria; Biodiversity; Dechlorination; Degradation; Dilution; Floods; Insecticides; Isomers; Plants (botany); Random processes; Redundancy; Stochastic models; Stochastic systems; Archaeon; Bacterial community; Community assembly; Functional redundancy; HCH-degradation; Loss of microbial diversity; Methanogenesis; Microbial diversity; Paddy soils; Γ-HCH; Soils; biodiversity; community structure; divergence; ecosystem function; greenhouse gas; HCH; methanogenesis; organochlorine pesticide; restoration ecology; stochasticity; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102452420

To improve the air quality in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region and guarantee a suitable environment during the military parade and other celebrating activities for the 70th anniversary of the victory for anti-Fascist Warcraft in the year 2015, a series of strict air quality control policies were carried out. To analyze the reduction extents of PM2.5 and organic matter components during the control period and to examine the meteorological conditions in this region and their decisive influence on the air quality, PM2.5 samples were collected and the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART was performed to calculate potential source locations within the BTH region. PM2.5, organic carbon (OC), elementary carbon (EC), and three species types were specifically analyzed. Although the results showed that PM2.5, OC, and EC reduced by 64.55%, 48.74%, and 60.75% during the control period, the air mass transport patterns showed great difference at certain periods, which altered the dominant transport direction of air mass and the potential source region of pollutants and organic matters. This alteration completely changed major atmospheric pollutants sources contribution and caused huge concentration changes. Parallel cases also showed that meteorological conditions could avoid massive atmospheric transported from a major emission source region to a receptor site. The meteorological conditions changed the main contribution source region in control and non-control periods and proved the air quality control measures were less necessary in some southern Hebei cities during special events periods. © 2021 by the authors.

Excess Co in Co1.5Cr1.5O4 existed as Co3+ that substituted for Cr3+ in the octahedral sites of the spinel lattice. High temperature treatment of the spinel catalysts in H2 resulted in stepwise reduction of Co3+ to Co2+ and eventually to Co metal. Both CoCr2O4 and Co1.5Cr1.5O4 catalysts were active and structurally stable in ethylene steam reforming under differential reaction conditions at 873 K, with the areal reforming rate over Co1.5Cr1.5O4 being one order-of-magnitude greater than that over CoCr2O4. The steady state reforming rate after oxidation was comparable to that over the fresh catalyst for both CoCr2O4 and Co1.5Cr1.5O4, indicating the stability of the spinel structure against reduction under steam reforming conditions.

However, current underwater repairing materials possess several problems, including insufficient bond tensile strength, inconsistency with the deformation of the old substrate, and insufficient underwater self-sealing ability. In the present paper, an experimental study was carried out to evaluate the influence of silica nanoparticles (SNs) on the properties of underwater composite-repairing materials. The underwater deformation, impermeability, bond tensile strength, and compressive strength of the SN-modified underwater composite-repairing materials were used as the properties’ evaluation indices. The results show that, within a certain range, the performance of the repairing material increase with increased SN percent. The deformability, impermeability grade, underwater bond tensile strength, and compressive strength of the SN-modified composite underwater repairing materials are 2.2%, 8, 2.91 MPa, and 115.87 MPa, respectively, when the mass ratio of the mortar, the curing agent and the SNs is 8:1:0.002. The proposed material is employed to repair the dam for a hydropower station in Guizhou province, China. Results show the seepage discharge is reduced by 8.6% when the dam is repaired. The annual average generating capacity is increased by 1.104 × 105 kWh. Meanwhile, CO2 and NOx emissions are reduced by 1.049 × 105 and 220.8 kg annually, respectively. © 2021 by the authors.

To determine whether this trend has continued or changed during the present century, this study systematically analyzes the characteristics of warming and dry–wet changes in eastern Northwest China based on the latest observational data and World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) collection data. The results show that eastern Northwest China has warmed continuously during the past 60 years with a sudden temperature change occurring in the late 1990s. However, the temperature in the 2000s decreased slowly, and that in the 2010s showed a warming trend. The amount of precipitation began to increase in the late 1990s, which indicates a contemporary climate transition from warm-dry to warm-wet in eastern Northwest China. The contribution of precipitation to humidity is significantly more than that of temperature. Long-term and interannual variations dominate the temperature change, with the contribution of the former much stronger than that of the latter. However, interannual variation dominates the precipitation change. The warming accelerates from period to period, and the temperature spatial consistently increased during the three most recent climatic periods. The precipitation decreased from 1961–1990 to 1981–2010, whereas its spatial consistency increased from 1981–2010 to 1991–2019. The significant warming and humidification which began in the late 1990s and is expected to continue until the end of the 21st century in the medium emission scenario. However, the current sub-humid climate will not easily be changed. The warming could cause a climate transition from warm temperate to subtropical by 2040. The dry-towet climate transition in eastern Northwest China could be related to a synergistic enhancement of the East Asian summer monsoon and the westerly circulation. This research provides a scientific decision-making basis for implementing western development strategies, ecological protection, and high-quality development of the Yellow River Basin Area as well as that for ecological construction planning and water resource management of eastern Northwest China. © 2021 by the authors.

Diels-Alder cycloaddition adduct was introduced into the CF/epoxy (EP) interphase region to endow the interphase with thermoreversible covalent bonds through the oxidative co-polymerization and chemical surface grafting, which was nondestructive but more efficient. The modified carbon fiber was characterized via SEM, AFM, XPS and TGA. The CF/EP interphase temperature range in CF reinforced polymer composites (CFRPs) was adjusted through controlling the electric current applied to CFs according to the thermo-sensitivity of CF. The effect of electrothermal effect on the matrix resin around CFs was measured by micro-FTIR. The interfacial shear strength (IFSS) measurement verified that the electrothermal effect promoted the reversible transformation of the Diels-Alder cycloaddition adducts connecting the modified CFs with matrix resin, resulting in the self-healing behavior of the damaged interphase. This self-healing strategy not only can improve the interfacial adhesion of CFRPs without damages to the CF surface caused by the traditional oxidation modification methods, but also can reduce the possible heating aging and deformation of composites caused by convective thermal repairing methods. This strategy is a more efficient process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon fiber; CFRPs; Diels-Alder adduct; Electrothermal effect; Interphase self-healing","Carbon fibers; Grafting (chemical); Linear transformations; Resins; Self-healing materials; Shear flow; Carbon fiber-epoxy; CF reinforced polymer composite; Diels Alder Adducts; Diels-Alder cycloadditions; Electro-thermal effects; Interphase self-healing; Matrix resin; Reversible transformation; Self-healing; Self-healing strategies; Electric heating",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103316385

Carbon pricing is an effective measure for reducing carbon emissions, but its distributional effects may exacerbate inequity among different rural and urban households. As a leading carbon pricing pilot area in China, Guangdong Province is the subject area of this paper. By using the environmentally extended input-output model and calculating the Suits index, this study aims to compare the carbon price payments of ten income-level households in Guangdong Province in 2012 and 2017. The results indicate that higher-income households need to pay more for carbon emissions. Total carbon pricing in Guangdong is slightly progressive, and the progressivity increased from 2012 to 2017. Thus, the implementation of carbon pricing may not intensify the inequality between urban and rural areas and between different income groups. Only carbon pricing on residential energy consumption is regressive, which could be compensated by revenue recycling policies. The findings of this study contribute by offering a positive theoretical basis for China's future policies on carbon pricing such as carbon taxes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon pricing; Guangdong province; Input-output analysis","Climate change; Costs; Economics; Energy utilization; Rural areas; Carbon emissions; Carbon pricing; Case-studies; Chinese Government; Climate change mitigation; Government IS; Guangdong Province; Income inequality; Input/Output analysis; Mitigation policies; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102408263

The annual mean concentration of PM2.5 was 142.3 μg/m3, and 75% of the daily PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the 75 μg/m3. The secondary inorganic ions, organic matter and mineral dust were the most abundant species, accounting for 39.6%, 19.2% and 9.3% of the total mass concentration, respectively. But the major chemical components showed clear seasonal dependence. SO42− was most abundant specie in spring and summer, which related to intensive photochemical reaction under high O3 concentration. In contrast, the secondary organic carbon and ammonium while primary organic carbon and ammonium significantly contributed to haze formation in autumn and winter, respectively. This indicated that the collaboration effect of secondary inorganic aerosols and carbonaceous matters result in heavy haze in autumn and winter. Six main sources were identified by positive matrix factorization model: industrial emission, combustion sources, traffic emission, mineral dust, oil combustion and secondary sulfate, with the annual contribution of 24%, 20%, 24%, 4%, 5% and 23%, respectively. The potential source contribution function analysis pointed that the contribution of the local and short-range regional transportation had significant impact. This result highlighted that local primary carbonaceous and precursor of secondary carbonaceous mitigation would be key to reduce PM2.5 and O3 during heavy haze episodes in winter and autumn. © 2020","Emission sources; PM2.5; Positive matrix factorization; Seasonal variations","Combustion; Dust; Factorization; Industrial emissions; Photochemical reactions; Sulfur compounds; Urban growth; Water pollution; Carbonaceous components; Positive matrix factorization models; Potential source contribution function; Primary organic carbons; Regional transportation; Secondary inorganic aerosol; Secondary organic carbon; Water soluble inorganic ions; Organic carbon; aerosol composition; chemical analysis; concentration (composition); emission inventory; industrial district; particulate matter; petrochemical industry; pollution monitoring; seasonal variation; source apportionment; aerosol; air pollutant; China; city; environmental monitoring; exhaust gas; particulate matter; season; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097353786

We evaluated the extent to which these countermeasures were effective in reducing PM2.5 concentrations by analyzing the long-term concentration trends of the major components of PM2.5 and their emissions in Nagoya City. PM2.5 concentrations decreased by 53% over the 16-year period from fiscal years 2003 to 2018 in Nagoya City. Elemental carbon (EC) was the component of PM2.5 with the greatest decrease in concentration over the 16 years, decreasing by 4.3 µg/m3, followed by SO4 2- (3.0 µg/m3), organic carbon (OC) (2.0 µg/m3), NH4 + (1.6 µg/m3), and NO3 - (1.3 µg/m3). The decrease in EC concentration was found to be caused largely by the effect of diesel emission control. OC concentrations decreased because of the effects of volatile organic compound (VOC) emission regulations for stationary sources and reductions in VOCs emitted by vehicles and construction machinery. NO3 - concentrations decreased alongside decreased contributions from vehicles, construction machinery, and stationary sources, in descending order of the magnitude of decrease. Although these findings identify some source control measures that have been effective in reducing PM2.5, they also reveal the ineffectiveness of some recent countermeasures for various components, such as those targeting OC concentrations. © 2021 by the authors.

It is believed that one of the most optimal solutions in this area (in terms of the reduction of gas emissions and economic efficiency) is the transition of modern automakers to unmanned vehicles and eco-cars, many of which can already allow the complete elimination of driver participation in the driving of the car. By 2030, the transition to such vehicles will become quite commonplace, at a time when a decade ago the current reality, born of an active leap in the development of scientific and technological progress, seemed fantastic. However, while pursuing well-intentioned goals, such as those related to the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of unmanned electric vehicles, there are a number of related problems that have not yet found their solution, mostly related to the quality of the legal torts. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Accident prevention; Environmental protection; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Planning; Unmanned vehicles; Agro-industrial complex; Atmospheric environment; Economic efficiency; Health safety; Legal supports; Optimal solutions; Technological progress; Transport industry; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107277001

It is now widely recognized that climate change could have a large impact on high-latitude wetlands. A key question is how climate change will affect the distribution pattern of wetland plant communities, and to what extent the transitions among different wetland plant communities respond to regional warming? To answer this question, we estimated the total SOC storage with 139 soil profiles in the Xing'anling Mountains and performed ensemble species distribution modelling for 11 dominant wetland plant communities by using numerous vegetation plots. Results show that 4.5–23.8% of the high-latitude wetlands in the study area would be lost following widespread thawing of permafrost under different climate warming scenarios by the end of this century. The total wetland SOC in the Xing'anling Mountains is estimated to be 1.58 Pg, about 25.5–29.3% of the total of China's wetlands, however, predicted wetland loss could put 5.4–20.5% (0.08–0.32 Pg C) of the total SOC storage at risk of instability. Our results also predicted a significant northward migration of southern Deyeuxia angustifolia communities driven by future climate changes. This wetland succession could profoundly reduce future carbon sequestration capacity of wetlands in the study area. The findings presented here are helpful for both current reserve management and future conservation planning of wetlands in the study area. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","carbon stocks; climate change; dominant wetland plant community; species distribution modeling; Xing'anling Mountains","Conservation; Ecosystems; Forestry; Risk perception; Soils; Wetlands; Carbon sequestration; Conservation planning; Distribution patterns; Ecosystem services; High latitude wetlands; Reserve management; Species distribution modelling; Terrestrial ecosystems; Climate change; carbon storage; climate change; climate effect; mountain region; plant community; spatial distribution; wetland; China; Da Hinggan Mountains; Deyeuxia; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103563467

A conventional LHTES integration method for heat pump based heating systems is to connect the heat pump's condenser for charging the LHTES unit. This integrating layout however usually leads to increased electricity input to the heating system. To underline this issue and provide solutions, this paper presents three new LHTES integrating layouts where the LHTES unit is connected with the de-superheater of the main heat pump (Case 2), the condenser of a cascaded booster heat pump cycle (Case 3), or a combination of using both the de-superheater and the booster cycle (Case 4). In the context of a multi-family house in Stockholm, a quasi-steady state heating system model was developed to evaluate the new integrating layouts, which were benchmarked against the baseline heating system without storage (Case 0) and the conventional integrating layout using the main heat pump condenser (Case 1). Hourly electric power input to the heating system was modelled for calculating the performance indicators including the heating performance factor, the operational expense and justifiable capital expense, and the indirect CO2 emissions. Two load shifting strategies were simulated for an evaluation period of Week 1, 2019: 1) charge during off-peak hours (8 pm to 6 am) and 2) charge during daytime hours (10 am to 7 pm). The simulation results of the off-peak charging strategy show that, in Cases 2–4, the heating performance factor is 22%-26% higher than Case 1 and the operational expense can be reduced by 2%-5% as compared with Case 0. The savings in the operational expense can justify the capital expense of 11 k-25 k Swedish Krona (SEK) for the LHTES systems in Cases 2–4 assuming a 15-year operation. Furthermore, the advantage of using the daytime charging strategy is principally the mitigation of CO2 emissions, which is up to 14% lower than the off-peak charging strategy. In summary, higher energy efficiency for heating is validated in the three new proposed integration layouts (Cases 2–4) against the condenser charging layout. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Economic analysis; Energy use; Heat pump; Load shifting; Phase change material; Thermal energy storage","Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Energy efficiency; Heat pump systems; Heat storage; Heating; Heating equipment; Integration; Latent heat; Phase change materials; Pumps; Storage (materials); Thermal energy; CO$-2$/ emission; Economics analysis; Energy storage unit; Energy use; Heat pumps; Heating system; Latent heat thermal energy storage; Load shifting; Phase Change; Thermal energy storage; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103973853

PM2.5 pollution in China is widespread and serious, which has aroused widespread concern of the government, the public and scholars. This paper evaluates the evolution trend and spatial pattern of PM2.5 pollution in China based on the data of 281 prefecture-level cities in China from 2007 to 2017, and reveals the pollution situation of PM2.5 and its relationship with industrial restructuring and technological progress by using spatial dynamic panel model. The results show that China’s PM2.5 pollution has significant path dependence and spatial correlation, and the industrial restructuring and technological progress have significant positive effects on alleviating PM2.5 pollution. As a decomposition item of technological progress, technical change effectively alleviates PM2.5 pollution. Another important discovery is that the interaction between industrial restructuring and technological progress will aggravate PM2.5 pollution. Finally, in order to effectively improve China’s air quality, while advocating the Chinese government to pursue high-quality development, this paper puts forward a regional joint prevention mechanism. © 2021 by the authors.

In order to detect the SF6 decomposition products, transition metal Pt cluster doping was chosen to enhance the adsorption property of intrinsic WSe2 monolayer. The adsorption of SO2, SOF2 and SO2F2 on Ptn (n = 1–3) doped WSe2 monolayer is studied based on the first-principle calculation. The adsorption energy, charge transfer, and density of states of the interaction between the target gas molecules and Ptn-WSe2 were studied. The calculation results showed that Pt3 doping dramatically enhances the adsorption of WSe2 to SO2 and SOF2 and SO2F2 molecules. Meanwhile, electrons transfer from Ptn-WSe2 surface to these three kinds of target gas molecules, reducing the conductivity of the adsorption system in different degrees.

We synthesize FeS encapsulated hierarchical porous S, N-dual-doped carbon (Fe-S, N-C-950) by coordinating ZIF-8 with an FeSO4-Phen complex, followed by carbonization at 950 °C in a H2/Ar atmosphere. 1, 10-phenanthroline (Phen) is used as the template to construct a hierarchical porous structure with a large specific surface area (586.8158 m2 g-1). Simultaneously, Phen is employed as the additional nitrogen source to enhance the doping level of active nitrogen-containing species.

Due to joint influences of regional climate change, runoff regulation and water withdrawal, ecological water deficiency has been increasingly prominent in endorheic salt lakes in Northwest China, especially in the Inner Mongolian Plateau. Previous studies mainly focused on establishing and applying methods to determine ecological water levels of lakes, while much less attention was paid to a more important problem – how such water levels could be reached under changed watershed hydrological processes. Solutions of this gap were explored in this study using the Dalinuoer Lake as an example. This lake is a typical endorheic salt lake located in the Inner Mongolian Plateau. It is a critical source to provide important ecological services and economic values for locals. Its ecological water level to maintain the optimum salinity threshold was first calculated by applying a statistical analysis of relationships between the phytoplankton biomass, salinity and water level of the lake. Potential measures to preserve the ecological water level of the lake were subsequently evaluated based on a hydrological process analysis of the watershed. The results indicated that the optimum salinity threshold was 5.7 g/L. This value should be also valid for other endorheic salt lakes in this region. According to a function between the water storage and the mean water depth of this lake, the ecological water level was determined to be 10.28 m with an ecological water deficit of 2.5 × 108 m3.

Submerged paddy soils exhibit huge N2O emission potential; however, the N2O emission pathway and underlying mechanisms for warming are not clearly understood. We conducted an incubation experiment using 15N to investigate the dynamics of N2O emission at controlled temperatures (5, 15, 25, and 35°C) in 125% water-filled pore space. The community structures of nitrifiers and denitrifiers were determined via high-throughput sequencing of functional genes. Our results showed that elevated temperature sharply enhanced soil N2O emission from submerged paddy soil. Denitrification was the main contributor, accounting for more than 90% of total N2O emission at all treatment temperatures. N2O ﬂux was coordinatively regulated by nirK-, nirS-, and nosZ-containing denitrifiers but not ammonia-oxidizing archaea or ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. The nirS-containing denitrifiers were more sensitive to temperature shifts, especially at a lower temperature range (5 to 25°C), and showed a stronger correlation with N2O ﬂux than that of nirK-containing denitrifiers. In contrast, nosZ-containing denitrifiers exhibited substantial variation at higher temperatures (15 to 35°C), thereby playing an important role in N2O consumption. Certain taxa of nirS- and nosZ-containing denitrifiers regulated N2O ﬂux, including nirS-containing denitrifiers affiliated with Rhodanobacter and Cupriavidus as well as nosZ-containing denitrifiers affiliated with Azoarcus and Azospirillum. Together, these findings suggest that elevated temperature can significantly increase N2O emission from denitrification in submerged paddy soils by shifting the overall community structures and enriching some indigenous taxa of nirS- and nosZ-containing denitrifiers. IMPORTANCE The interdependence between global warming and greenhouse gas N2O has always been the hot spot. However, information on factors contributing to N2O and temperature-dependent community structure changes is scarce. This study demonstrated high-temperature-induced N2O emission from submerged paddy soils, mainly via stimulating denitrification. Further, we speculate that key functional denitrifiers drive N2O emission. This study showed that denitrifiers were more sensitive to temperature rise than nitrifiers, and the temperature sensitivity differed among denitrifier communities. N2O-consuming denitrifiers (nosZ-containing denitrifiers) were more sensitive at a higher temperature range than N2O-producing denitrifiers (nirS-containing denitrifiers). This study’s findings help predict N2O ﬂuxes under different degrees of warming and develop strategies to mitigate N2O emissions from paddy fields based on microbial community regulation.

Traditional approaches of estimating these parameters are labour-intensive, destructive, and with high uncertainties. This paper describes a challenging attempt to estimate field maize height and dry AGB through aerodynamic parameters of Zero Plane Displacement (ZPD), aerodynamic roughness length (ARL) and the combination index (CI) of ZPD and ARL, which are used to characterize the interaction between vegetation and atmosphere. ZPD/ARL was calculated from gradient wind data based on the Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory. The experiment was conducted at Daman Irrigation District in the Heihe River Basin with continuous observations during three maize growing seasons. Although the CI based height estimation shows a high R2 of 0.97 and a low RMSE of 0.14 m, the error analysis of the model shows a high error of -0.59 m∼+0.739 m. The ZPD and CI based biomass estimations in power fitting show high R2 of 0.98 and 0.97 with low RMSE under 5% and 7% of the maximum dry AGB, however, the steep curve in the middle and late growing stages shows serious sensitivity to the variations of ZPD and CI. Considering the high sensitivity and uncertainties in estimating crop biomass or crop height, it is concluded that this micrometeorology based method is difficult and cumbersome to be practicable. It will always need assistance of the simple traditional sampling. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Dry above-ground biomass; Height; Maize; Zero place displacement","aboveground biomass; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural land; air-soil interaction; climate change; crop plant; crop yield; data set; field method; growing season; hypothesis testing; maize; Hei River",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100390802

However, the comprehensive analyses on the climate-smartness of current agricultural production systems have been lack. Here, we assessed the changes in agricultural production systems and their influences on food productivity, greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, food carbon footprint (CF), nitrogen and water use efficiency, and economic profit of major crops in the North China Plain (NCP) at sub-provincial level over 2000–2016. We further identified the prior areas and agronomic management practices to be improved where nitrogen and water use efficiency was low, CF was high, or/and economic profit was low. The results showed that wheat, maize, vegetables, and oil crops were always dominant crops in the NCP and maize planting area increased most among all crops types over 2000–2016. The non-uniformity of agricultural landscape led to the decline of Shannon-Wiener Index and Simpson's diversity Index. Agricultural GHG emissions and CF had spatially explicit patterns, along with crop yields and agricultural inputs. Among the agricultural inputs, fertilizer played a dominant role and contributed about 58.0%, 81.6%, and 77.3% respectively to the CF of wheat, maize, and oil crops, and plastic film contributed up to 55.1% to the CF of vegetables. The CF had a decreasing trend, while nitrogen use efficiency, irrigation water use efficiency and economic profit had an increasing trend, mainly due to increased yields, reduced agricultural inputs including fertilizers and irrigation, and improved agronomic managements.

Numerical simulations based on the Discrete Element Method (DEM) on the motion trajectory of ACB fillers in the rotary dryer were conducted, and the parameters of flight structure, rotational speed, and filling degree on the dynamic behavior of ACB fillers were optimized. Under various rotational speeds and filling degrees, the experimental results fit the numerical-simulated results very well. The optimized flight configuration was the straight flights with a length of 65 mm, and the optimized rotational speed and filling degree were 35 rpm and 15%, respectively. Under the optimized condition, both the response variables, the mass of particles in the airborne phase (MAP) and the percentage of occupied area in the airborne region (OAR), have the optimal values, in which the dryer will have a better drying performance. Besides, the lower-right area of the drum is empty which is convenient for the installation of the inlet pipe. The drying experiments of industrial wastewaters were also studied using this ACB filled rotary drum dryer under the optimized conditions. Under the optimal operational conditions, the evaporation capacities of the high-salt wastewater and landfill leachate could reach as high as 49.7 kg/h and 90 kg/h, respectively. This study highlights the integration of evaporation and drying processes of this novel ACB filled rotary dryer and provides an efficient and zero-liquid-emission strategy for the thermal treatment of industrial wastewater. © 2021 by the authors.

Pure phase FeCo2O4 powders can only be formed in the temperature range of 950–1050 °C. In this work, we study the cation occupation, cation valence, bond length and bond angle changes of the pure phase FeCo2O4 powders formed in such a narrow temperature range. Octahedral lattice distortion in the pure phase FeCo2O4 samples has been observed. More tetrahedral Fe3+ and octahedral Co2+ are excited and exchanged their sites as the calcination temperature increases from 950 °C to 1000 °C, and part of Co3+ ions are reduced to Co2+ in the sample calcined at 1050 °C. The structure of the sample calcined at 1000 °C is close to that of the ideal FeCo2O4 spinel. Magnetic measurements show that ferrimagnetism and anti-ferromagnetism coexist in the pure phase FeCo2O4 samples. Interaction changes between ferrimagnetism and antiferromagnetism caused by the structural changes of the samples have been studied. Due to the pinning of the local anti-ferromagnetism to ferrimagnetism in the sample, the sample shows a Barkhausen jump below 150 K.

For clarifying the space structure of a low-carbon eco-city, and combining the concept of “Combining Assessment with Construction” to track and contrast the construction of the low-carbon eco-city, this research selects quantifiable low-carbon eco-city spatial characteristics as indicators, and evaluates and analyzes the potential carbon emissions. Taking the Jinan Western New District as an example, diversity of construction land, travel carbon emission potential, and density and accessibility of adjacent road networks in the overall urban planning were measured. After the completion of the new urban area, the evaluation mainly reflected certain factors, such as the mixed degree of urban functions, the density of urban functions, the walking distance to bus stops and the density and number of bus stops. Dividing the levels and adding equal weights after index normalization, the carbon emission potential is evaluated at the two levels of the overall and fragmented areas. The results show that: (1) The low-carbon emission potential areas in the planning scheme basically reached the planned goals. (2) There is inconsistency between districts and indicators in the planning scheme. The diversity of construction land and the accessibility of the adjacent road network are relatively small; however, there is a large difference between the travel carbon emission potential and the road network accessibility. (3) Carbon emission potential after completion did not reach the planned expectation, and the low-carbon emission potential plots were concentrated in the Changqing Old City Area and Central Area of Dangjia Town Area.

However, the sediment microbial communities and their respiratory responses to the lake wetland succession are poorly understood. In this study, we collected sediment samples from four different succession points (the Potamogeton lucens zone, the Scirpus tabernaemontani zone, the Scirpus triqueter zone, and the Juncus effusus zone) in the Caohai Wetland of the Guizhou Plateau (China). The bacterial communities at these succession points were studied using a high-throughput sequencing approach. The sediment microbial respiration (SR) was measured using static chambers in the field and basal respiration (BR) was determined in the laboratory. The results show that the dominant bacterial taxa in the sediment was Proteobacteria (34.7%), Chloroflexi (17.8%), Bacteroidetes (7.3%), Acidobacteria (6.6%), and Cyanobacteria (6.1%). Principal coordinate analysis showed that the microbial community structure differs significantly at different sampling points along the successional gradient, indicating that the bacterial community structure is sensitive to the lake wetland succession. Different hydrological regimes and soil characteristics such as NH4+-N, Fe2+, Mn2+, and sediment organic carbon (SOC) content may be important factors responsible for the differences in the sediment microbial characteristics of the different successional stages in the Caohai wetland. Additionally, it was found that the SR increased significantly from the P. lucens zone to the J. effusus zone, but BR had the opposite response. The shifts in the bacterial community structure along the successional gradient may be the main reason for the observed differences in sediment respiration. © 2020, Chinese Society for Oceanology and Limnology, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Caohai Wetland; lake wetland; microbial respiration; sediment bacteria",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85092637466

Over the years, the number of Environment Council meetings has increased signifcantly, although recently it has plateaued at around four formal meetings per year. The member governments' top political leaders meet in a different forum-the European Council-which until recently had little direct engagement with environmental issues.

This study uses the city-level panel data, 113 key cities of environment protection from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment, covering most of the provinces in China for the period 2013–2017 to investigate the different impacts of the new urbanization pilot policy on air quality and related air pollutants including six major pollutant sources, which are PM2.5, PM10, SO2, CO, NO2, and O3. The study finds that, first, based on the difference-in-difference (DID) method, the new urbanization on average tends to improve the air quality in the pilot cities. Second, based on the quantile DID method, the new urbanization tends to improve the air quality in the lower air quality quantiles (0.1–0.6); however, it has no significant impact in the higher air quality quantiles (0.7–0.9). Third, the impacts of the new urbanization on the air quality vary among different energy-related air pollutants. The new urbanization pilot policy tends to restrain SO2, PM10, and PM2.5, increase CO and O3 and has no impact on NO2. The results indicate that China should pay more attention to promote green consumption and new energy applications and increase urban construction efficiency to further reducing air pollutions in the new urbanization process. © Copyright © 2021 Wu, Cui and Hu.","air pollutants; air quality; China; difference in difference; new urbanization strategy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107414008

It affects planetary albedo and can influence marine biological productivity and ocean-atmosphere carbon dynamics. This makes the understanding of the global dust cycle crucial for constraining the dust/climate relationship, which requires long-term dust emission records for all major dust sources. Despite their importance, the sources of atmospheric dust deposited in the Southern Ocean remain poorly constrained. Eolian dust in the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean is generally assumed to originate from Australia, with minor contributions from New Zealand. Here, we present a high-resolution elemental record of terrestrial inputs for the past ∼410 kyr from marine sediment core PS75/100-4 recovered from east of South Island, New Zealand. Sediment grain size is slightly finer than that of loess deposits from South Island, New Zealand, and is coarser than that of marine sediments in the Tasman Sea to the west of New Zealand, which indicates that the dust originated mainly from New Zealand and not only from Australia. Core PS75/100-4 records lithogenic mass accumulation rates ranging from ∼0.01 to 0.69 g/cm2/kyr (∼0.20 g/cm2/kyr average), with variations over a factor of ∼3–4 over glacial versus interglacial timescales for the past 410 kyr. Our geochemical data correlate well with the Southern Ocean and Antarctic eolian dust records and suggest a westerly wind-supplied dust signal from New Zealand. Our findings, therefore, suggest that New Zealand should be considered an important long-term regional dust source in global dust cycle models. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

Despite the impact factors on cities’ carbon emission reduction have been extensively studied in recent years, little attention has been paid to investigating the key driving force (KDF) on the development of LCC. This study aims to explore the KDF affecting LCC within the context of China through identifying systematically representative forces (RFs) and examining the interactive relationships between RFs. Based on topic modeling of Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), RFs for LCC are identified firstly from the policies issued by the pilot LCCs in China. Then KDFs for LCC are investigated through establishing the interactive relationships between RFs by adopting the Interpretive Structure Modeling (ISM). Results show that: (1) 16 RFs on LCC are identified from the pilot LCC policies in China; (2) emission trading system, carbon emission accounting system, and low carbon planning are identified as the KDFs on the development of LCC; (3) carbon sink is positioned at the topmost level and performs as the most frontier force on the development of LCC. Results of the KDFs identification can provide policy-makers with insight for designing LCC improvement path, and consequently promote emission mitigation in China. © 2021 The Author(s)","China; Interpretive Structural Modeling; Key driving force; Latent Dirichlet Allocation; Low carbon city; Representative force","Emission control; Environmental management; Statistics; Accounting system; Carbon emission reductions; Emission mitigation; Emission trading systems; Interactive relationships; Latent dirichlet allocations; Low carbon planning; Structure modeling; Carbon; carbon emission; carbon sink; emission control; environmental economics; policy making; urban pollution; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099679701

The characteristics of endophytic bacterial communities of Phragmites australis and Chloris virgata and their functions in hydrocarbon degradation and plant growth promotion have been studied using both high-throughput sequencing and conventional microbial techniques. Through 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, we found five bacterial phyla that were dominant among the endophytic bacterial communities of the two grass species, including Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, and Tenericutes. The phylum Proteobacteria was common among the endophytic bacterial communities of the two grass species. The diversity in the endophytic bacterial community of Chloris virgata was generally higher than that in the community of Phragmites australis. Thirty-eight hydrocarbon-degrading endophytic bacteria were isolated from the two grasses via culturing techniques. Based on phylogenetic analyses, the bacterial isolates were classified into the phyla Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Actinobacteria. The majority of strains belonged to the genera Bacillus and Pseudomonas. More than 70% of the isolates of hydrocarbon-degrading endophytes exhibited the ability to stimulate plant growth. These isolates mainly belonged to Bacillus sp., Pseudomonas sp., Beijerinckia sp., Serratia sp., Acinetobacter sp., Microbacterium sp., and Rhizobium sp. Altogether, the present study revealed that Phragmites australis and Chloris virgata growing on petroleum-polluted saline soil in the Yellow River Delta harbor several diverse species of endophytic bacteria and serve as novel sources of beneficial bacteria and hydrocarbon degradation. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Chloris virgata; Endophytic bacterial community; Hydrocarbon degradation; Phragmites australis; Plant growth promotion","Bacteriology; Biodegradation; Bioremediation; Gasoline; Hydrocarbons; River pollution; Rivers; RNA; Bacterial community; Endophytic bacteria; Functional characteristics; High-throughput sequencing; Hydrocarbon degradation; Phragmites australis; Phylogenetic analysis; Plant growth promotion; Bacteria; hydrocarbon; RNA 16S; bacterium; biodegradation; bioremediation; community response; endophyte; grass; growth response; hydrocarbon; microbial community; oil pollution; phytoremediation; soil remediation; Acinetobacter; Actinobacteria; amplicon; Article; Bacillus; bacterium; Bacteroidetes; Beijerinckia; China; Chloris virgata; degradation; Firmicutes; grass; high throughput sequencing; Microbacterium; microbial community; microbial diversity; Mollicutes; nonhuman; Phragmites australis; phytoremediation; plant growth; priority journal; Proteobacteria; Pseudomonas; Rhizobium; salt tolerance; sequence analysis; Serratia; soil analysis; soil pollution; bacterium; China; genetics; phylogeny; Poaceae; river; China; Shandong; Yellow River Delta; Acinetobacter sp.; Actinobacteria; Bacillus sp.; Bacteria (microorganisms); Bacteroidetes; Bacteroidetes phylum; Beijerinckia sp.; Chloris virgata; Firmicutes; Microbacterium sp.; Mollicutes; Phragmites australis; Poaceae; Proteobacteria; Pseudomonas; Pseudomonas sp.; Rhizobium sp.; Serratia sp.; Bacteria; China; Phylogeny; Poaceae; Rivers; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098946747

However, the causal relationship between green energy sources and carbon emissions volatility has received limited attention. This study aims to close a knowledge gap in this area. The current study analyzes the renewable energy sources (wind, hydro, and geothermal) and carbon emissions of four ASEAN countries (Indonesia, Thailand, Vietnam, and the Philippines) between 2000 and 2019. The present study combined Chudik and Pesaran’s (2015) newly developed Dynamic Common Correlated Effects (DCCE) with cutting‐edge investigation tools such as first‐ and second‐generation unit root tests; CS‐dependence; Variance inflation factor test for multicollinearity; and Pedroni, Kao, and Wester Lund tests of co‐integration. The Granger causality test is also used to check the short‐term and long‐term causal effects within the renewable energy sources and green energy sources, and carbon volatility. According to the empirical results, green energy sources make a positive and vital contribution to reducing carbon emissions growth in the above‐noted ASEAN economies. Furthermore, short‐ and long‐run causality runs from green energy sources to carbon emission volatility in the region.

For this purpose, this work employs the generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity in mean (GARCH(1,1)-M) model with state space time-varying parameter (Kalman filter), Modified Amihud illiquidity ratio, fixed effect variable intercept panel regression model and panel impulse response analysis. The empirical results are as follows: (1) Shenzhen pilot is the best performer for the market efficiency, followed by Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong and Hubei; although the other four except the Shenzhen pilot are inconsistent with weak-form efficiency, the market efficiency of Beijing pilot has improved and the Hubei pilot has the lowest market efficiency; (2) there are the positively long-term equilibrium relationship between market efficiency and market liquidity of pilots; and (3) market liquidity can positively affect the market efficiency of pilots lasting three months. These findings suggest that the market participation ability, linkages between carbon markets, speculation of low market efficiency and carbon derivatives tools can be considered by unified China's national carbon market. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","China's ETS pilots; GARCH(1,1)-M with Kalman filter; Market efficiency; Market liquidity; Panel data analysis","Efficiency; Emission control; Impulse response; Regression analysis; Emissions Trading Scheme; Emissions trading system; Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity; Impulse response analysis; Market efficiency; Market liquidity; Market participations; Weak form efficiencies; Commerce; carbon; carbon emission; data set; emissions trading; market conditions; market development; panel data; Article; carbon footprint; China; commercial phenomena; controlled study; data analysis; economic aspect; emission trading scheme pilot; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental parameters; generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity; geographic distribution; Kalman filter; market efficiency; market liquidity; Modified Amihud illiquidity ratio; pollution and pollution related phenomena; priority journal; statistical analysis; temporal analysis; Beijing [Beijing (ADS)]; Beijing [China]; China; Guangdong; Hubei; Shanghai; Shenzhen",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099852646

Based on panel data of 30 provinces from 2005 to 2017, this paper uses the difference‐in‐difference method to study the impact of China’s carbon emission trading pilot markets on carbon emissions and regional green development. The paper also explores possible influencing channels. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) China’s carbon emission trading policy has promoted a reduction in CO2 emissions and carbon emission intensity and has increased green development in the pilot areas. (2) The main path for China’s carbon emission trading policy to achieve carbon emission reduction and regional green development is to promote technology adoption. (3) China’s carbon emission trading policy achieves green development through synergistic SO2 emission reduction. The pilot carbon markets have reduced both the amount of SO2 emissions and SO2 emission intensity. © 2021 by the authors.

This study took Qionglai City as the research area and utilized land-use, satellite remote sensing and other data to demarcate the ecological space from the perspective of the dynamic changes of ecosystem service functions with the support of ESRI ArcGIS and IDRISI. And then we applied the Markov-CA model to simulate the spatial pattern of the dominant ecosystem service functions for the ecological space in 2025 with integrating the change characteristics of the dominant ecosystem service functions. The results showed that: (1) The dynamic change characteristics of ecosystem service functions were obvious. The critical value of comprehensive function value and average annual change rate of ecosystem service functions were 6 and 5% respectively. (2) The ecological space area was 98307hm2, which was intensively distributed in the western and central south of the city. Its distribution was consistent with the ecological space range in the local ecological civilization construction plan, which indicated that the ecological space delineation method based on the dynamics of ecosystem service functions is reliable. (3) The dominant ecosystem service functions had shifted and showed strong non-stationarity during 2003-2019, so the dynamicity of the dominant ecosystem service functions should be fully considered in the ecological space zoning management and other related planning. (4) The Markov-CA model was of high simulation accuracy (Kappa coefficient > 0.95), and the simulation results were consistent with the regional ecological function zoning basically. Therefore, the model can be applied to simulate the spatial layout of dominant ecosystem service functions for ecological space in the future. (5) The dominant ecosystem service functions in Qionglai will still undergo mutual conversions during 2019-2025. The ecological space will still maintain the three dominant functions including primary product production, climate regulation and hydrological regulation in 2025, but the area of them will change into 32793hm2, 52490hm2 and 13024hm2 respectively. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Climate change; Land use; Planning; Remote sensing; Sustainable development; Zoning; Construction plan; Ecological functions; Ecosystem service functions; Kappa coefficient; Non-stationarities; Satellite remote sensing; Sichuan province; Simulation accuracy; Ecosystems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106187233

We collect party secretary data for Chinese counties between 2001 and 2014 to measure promotion patterns. We construct county-year SO2 and PM2.5 pollution measures using NASA satellite data. We adopt an instrumental variable approach to deal with potential endogeneity issues of the pollution variables: for both PM 2.5 and SO2, we use ventilation coefficient, i.e., the product of wind speed and mixing layer height, as the instrument. Our empirical analysis shows that for county party secretaries, those who are able to reduce air pollution are more likely to be promoted. We find similar results for county magistrates.

The cytokine, interleukin (IL)-15, is crucial for development and activation of CD8 T lymphocytes, a prominent lymphocytic population present in TBI lesions. We investigated whether IL-15 originates from astrocytes and whether IL-15 can evoke the CD8 T-lymphocyte response in TBI. We observed that astrocytes were activated in a rat model of TBI and that IL-15 was overexpressed on the surface of astrocytes. Further, CD8 T lymphocytes infiltrating TBI lesions colocalized with IL-15-expressing astrocytes. Activated CD8 T lymphocytes released granzyme B (Gra-b), which, in turn, activated caspase-3-induced poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase cleavage and, ultimately, neuronal apoptosis. Conversely, inhibition of astrocyte activation by pre-treatment with the specific inhibitor, fluorocitrate (FC), that reduces carbon flux through the Krebs cycle in astrocytes resulted in improved neurological function and memory. FC pre-treatment was also associated with downregulated IL-15 expression and CD8 T-cell activation as well as decreased levels of neuronal apoptosis, suggesting that IL-15 initiated a domino effect toward apoptosis. In contrast, rats pre-treated with recombinant rat IL-15 showed upregulated CD8 T-cell numbers and Gra-b levels, in addition to induction of neuronal apoptosis. Together, our results indicated that IL-15 could induce neuronal apoptosis by enhancing CD8 T-cell function in a rat model of TBI. © 2021 Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. publishers.","astrocytes; CD8 T cells; IL-15; neuronal apoptosis; traumatic brain injury","caspase 3; fluorocitric acid; granzyme B; interleukin 15; nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide adenosine diphosphate ribosyltransferase; adult; animal experiment; animal model; animal tissue; Article; astrocyte; CD8+ T lymphocyte; cell activation; citric acid cycle; controlled study; down regulation; enzyme activation; male; neuroapoptosis; nonhuman; protein cleavage; protein expression; protein localization; rat; traumatic brain injury",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105744456

The deployment of energy storage devices in the RIES can deepen the connection of each energy system, release the spatial and temporal constraints of multiple energy sources, and thus improve the energy utilization and economy of the integrated energy system. Based on the infrastructure and model of the RIES, this paper studied the synergistic optimal configuration of electricity storage, power-to-gas (P2G) technology, cooling storage and heating storage in the case of multi-energy complementation operation of combined cooling, heating and power supply (CCHP) unit and other equipment. Firstly, an optimal configuration model of multiple energy storage in the RIES based on the optimal operational economy was proposed. Then, the economics and feasibility of configuring different energy storage combinations in the system were analyzed. Finally, the benefits of energy storage devices in the regional integrated energy system were quantified and analyzed by the economic indicators and low carbon emissions reduction indicators. By employing an industrial district RIES in northern China as the study case, the operation scheduling scheme and energy storage allocation scheme were solved by the optimization model proposed in this paper. The results show that the RIES containing multiple types of energy storage can consume more distributed new energy, improve economic efficiency and reduce carbon emissions. And this model has a good application prospect. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Carbon; Economics; Electric power supplies to apparatus; Electric power systems; Emission control; Energy policy; Energy utilization; Application prospect; Electricity storages; Environmental pollutions; Integrated energy systems; Low-carbon emissions; Operation scheduling; Optimization modeling; Temporal constraints; Electric energy storage",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105909719

We aimed to examine the effects of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) on quantiles of birth weight, and if effects were heterogeneous in different populations and regions. We used a prospective cohort study of 196 283 singleton term live births from 16 counties across China during 2014-2018. PM2.5 exposure for full gestation, each trimester and last gestational month were assessed by Inverse Distance Weighting interpolation. Linear and quantile regression were conducted to estimate associations between PM2.5 exposure and mean birth weight, as well as birth weight distribution, with birthweight z-score as the main outcome. Stratified analyses and Cochran Q tests were conducted by maternal and geographical characteristics. Each 10 µg m-3 increase in average PM2.5 over the entire pregnancy was associated with reduced birthweight z-score (-0.010, 95% CI: -0.015, -0.005) and birth weight (-3.21 g, 95% CI: -5.27, -1.15). In quantile regression, more pronounced effects were observed in lower and intermediate quantiles, with a decrease of 0.021 (95% CI: 0.033, 0.009) and 0.009 (95% CI: 0.015, 0.002) in the 5th and 50th quantiles of birthweight z-score, respectively. Additionally, we observed stronger associations among well-educated, migrant and primiparous mothers as well as in coastal areas. Maternal exposure to PM2.5 was associated with reduction in birth weight, especially for those with very low birth weight. Well-educated, migrant and primiparous mothers, as well as births in coastal areas may be more sensitive to PM2.5 in our study population. The results may be relevant to targeted public health interventions to reduce maternal exposure to air pollution. © 2021 The Author(s).

Some evidence suggests that lockdown strategies have significantly reduced traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) in regions across the world. However, the impact of COVID-19 on TRAP on roadside is still not clearly understood. In this study, we assessed the influence of the COVID-19 lockdown on the levels of traffic-related air pollutants in Shanghai. The pollution data from two types of monitoring stations—roadside stations and non-roadside stations were compared and evaluated. The results show that NO2, PM2.5, PM10, and SO2 had reduced by ~30–40% at each station during the COVID-19 pandemic in contrast to 2018–2019. CO showed a moderate decline of 28.8% at roadside stations and 16.4% at non-roadside stations. In contrast, O3 concentrations increased by 30.2% at roadside stations and 5.7% at non-roadside stations. This result could be resulted from the declined NOx emissions from vehicles, which lowered O3 titration. Full lockdown measures resulted in the highest reduction of primary pollutants by 34–48% in roadside stations and 18–50% in non-roadside stations. The increase in O3 levels was also the most significant during full lockdown by 64% in roadside stations and 33% in non-roadside stations due to the largest decrease in NO2 precursors, which promote O3 formation. Additionally, Spearman's rank correlation coefficients between NO2 and other pollutants significantly decreased, while the values between NO2 and O3 increased at roadside stations. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","COVID-19; Lockdown; Roadside; Traffic-related air pollution (TRAP)","Air pollution; Economics; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Air pollutants; Global economic growth; Monitoring stations; Primary pollutants; Shanghai , China; Spearman's rank correlation coefficients; Traffic-related; Traffic-related air pollution; Roadsides; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; health policy; lockdown; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; road traffic; roadside environment; sulfur dioxide; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101385343

Most models of how greenhouse gases like CO2 evolve with time on terrestrial planets are deterministic, but the complex, nonlinear nature of Earth's climate history motivates study of nondeterministic climate models. Here a maximally simple stochastic model of CO2 evolution and climate on an Earth-like planet with an imperfect CO2 thermostat is investigated. It is shown that as stellar luminosity is increased in this model, the decrease in the average atmospheric CO2 concentration renders the climate increasingly unstable, with excursions to a low-temperature state common once the received stellar flux approaches that of present-day Earth. Unless climate feedbacks always force the variance in CO2 concentration to decline rapidly with received stellar flux, this means that terrestrial planets near the inner edge of the habitable zone may enter Snowball states quite frequently. Observations of the albedos and color variation of terrestrial-type exoplanets should allow this prediction to be tested directly in the future. © 2021. The American Astronomical Society.

Chaparral – including genera of Ceanothus, Adenostoma, Quercus, Salvia and Arctostaphylos – is a dense, drought-tolerant vegetation assemblage with a closed canopy 3–5 m in height. Chaparral is a fire-prone ecosystem and wildfires have burned the SDEF about every 40 years. The SDEF was established in 1933 to quantify the water cycle in a steep, semiarid landscape. Study catchments range in size from 15 to 1160 ha and measurements of stream runoff are made in a nested weir and flume arrangement to account for the very flashy flows. Apart from native chaparral vegetation, streamflow measurements in these study watersheds have also quantified the hydrologic response of vegetation type-conversion and fire. Innovations in hydrologic monitoring developed on the SDEF include a critical depth flume (the San Dimas flume) and tilted rain gages to better sample precipitation in mountainous terrain. Subsurface runoff and plant water relations have been measured in a large lysimeter complex. Water quality monitoring shows that stream water in the SDEF has very high levels of nitrate, derived from atmospheric deposition of chronic air pollution, that approach the Federal EPA standard of 10.0 mg L−1 for nitrate-N.

This increases the need to search for new tools that will have the capacity to generate information supporting the decision-making process in the area of enterprise management in terms of ecological, economic, and social goals. For these reasons, synthetic measures of development were constructed on the basis of the set of diagnostic variables describing various aspects of sustainable development in the case. Based on the environmental synthetic indicators, it has been possible to point out the Polish voivodeships, in which enterprises that are particularly harmful to the environment were able to reduce the emissions of dust and gaseous pollutants in the 2005–2019 period. These changes were often accompanied by an increase in the production of energy from renewable sources and increasing the supply of plants with devices to contain gaseous and dust pollutants. Moreover, the comparison of positioning the voivodeships in the rankings according to social, economic, and environmental synthetic measures shows that the reduction of the negative impact of energy-intensive enterprises on the environment has been associated with higher the position of the voivodeship in the ranking connected with the health of its inhabitants. It has been also seen that the largest pool of funds was allocated to the voivodeships that need them the most, as these voivodeships were low in the ranking with respect to the degree of the reduction of dust and gaseous emissions by enterprises that are particularly harmful to the environment. The results for regression analysis indicated at the existence of the inter-temporal relationships between the well-being of society and the environmental– economic effects of enterprises’ activities. It was noticed that increasing the possibilities of financing investments in low-emission development of the region, including the modernization of enterprises in terms of decreasing dust and gaseous pollutant emissions and reducing their energy consumption, has a significant impact on the improvement of well-being of society with a one-year lag. In contrast to other studies that mainly refer to the environmental and economic effects of managing enterprises that are particularly harmful to the environment, this paper focuses on the social aspect of the change in the health of the population connected with the emissions of pollutants. A novel approach based on the set of three multi-criteria synthetic measures is proposed to assess the environmental, economic, and social activities of enterprises in individual voivodeships in Poland in the long 2005–2019 period. © 2021 by the authors.

An expanding body of literature relates to assessing whether consumers would be willing to pay for these ‘green’ practices in the aviation industry, such as biofuels or sustainable airport construction/renovations. While previous studies have experimentally examined these scenarios, we are aware of no prior research that has proposed and assessed a structural model related to determining which factors influence consumer's perspectives on ‘green’ airports. A sample of 722 eligible participants from the United States completed the study using Amazon's Mechanical Turk. We examined future time perspective, affect toward climate change, the perceived value of sustainability, and perceptions of climate change on the endogenous variables of willingness to pay for sustainability and intentions to take action against climate change. Six of the seven hypotheses proposed were supported. Affect, perceived value, and perceptions of climate change were all significant and positively related to willingness to pay, which was positively associated with intention to act. Two non-hypothesized paths, between perceived value and future time perspective, were also positively related to intention to act. The model explained 42% of the variance in willingness to pay and 66% in intention to act. These findings offer insights into what factors significantly influence these relationships as they relate to airports. Perceived value and perceptions of climate change had the largest effect sizes in the model and were significantly related to willingness to pay and intentions to act. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Green aviation; Mediation; Structural equation modeling; Sustainability; Willingness to pay","Airports; Climate models; Green manufacturing; Sustainable development; Airport construction; Amazon's mechanical turks; Aviation industry; Future time perspectives; Model analysis; Perceived value; Structural modeling; Willingness to pay; Climate change; air transportation; airport construction; climate change; numerical model; perception; regression analysis; sustainability; willingness to pay; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103962055

Climate projections are produced with increasingly complex models that attempt to represent key processes in the Earth system, including atmospheric and oceanic circulations, convection, clouds, snow, sea ice, vegetation, and interactions with the carbon cycle. Uncertainties in the representation of these processes feed through into a range of projections from the many state-of-the-art climate models now being developed and used worldwide. For example, despite major improvements in climate models, the range of equilibrium global warming due to doubling carbon dioxide still spans a range of more than 3. Here a promising way to make use of the ensemble of climate models to reduce the uncertainties in the sensitivities of the real climate system is reviewed. The emergent constraint approach uses the model ensemble to identify a relationship between an uncertain aspect of the future climate and an observable variation or trend in the contemporary climate. This review summarizes previous published work on emergent constraints and discusses the promise and potential dangers of the approach. Most importantly, it argues that emergent constraints should be based on well-founded physical principles such as the fluctuation-dissipation theorem. This review will stimulate physicists to contribute to the rapidly developing field of emergent constraints on climate projections, bringing to it much needed rigor and physical insights. © 2021 American Physical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Earth (planet); Global warming; Sea ice; Climate projection; Climate science; Climate sensitivity; Fluctuation dissipation theorem; Model ensembles; Oceanic circulations; Physical principles; State of the art; Climate models",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106507341

In particular, the role of Southern Ocean paleocirculation changes is poorly constrained, in part, owing to a paucity of sedimentary records from this region. In this study we present multiproxy data – including neodymium isotope and sortable silt measurements – for paleocirculation changes within the deep (3167 m water depth) Indian sector of the Southern Ocean from a new sediment core, TT1811-34GGC (41.718°S, 80.163°E). We find a tight coupling between circulation changes, Antarctic climate, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations throughout the last 118,000 years, even during the initial stages of glacial inception of Marine Isotope Stage (MIS) 5.4 to 5.1. We find that periods of cooling correspond to reductions in the entrainment of North Atlantic-sourced waters within the deep Southern Ocean, as evidenced by more radiogenic neodymium isotope values of deep water bathing our core site. Cooling also corresponds to generally slower bottom water flow speeds, as indicated by finer sortable silt size fractions. A reduction in entrainment of North-Atlantic sourced waters occurred during MIS 5.4–5.1, when Atlantic circulation was strong, suggesting a Southern hemisphere control on paleocirculation changes at that time. We hypothesise that expanded Southern Ocean sea-ice during MIS 5.4 increased the density of the deep Southern Ocean, reducing the ability of Atlantic-sourced waters to mix into Lower Circumpolar Deep Water. This led to an expanded contribution of Pacific Deep Water within the lower circulation cell and increased stratification within the deep Southern Ocean. These paleocirculation changes can help account for the reduction in atmospheric CO2 across the MIS 5.5 to 5.4 transition, and in doing so help explain the chain of events surrounding the decent into the last glacial period. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Antarctic Climate; Neodymium isotopes; Ocean Circulation; Paleocirculation; Paleoclimate; Sortable Silt; Southern Ocean","Carbon dioxide; Flow of water; Glacial geology; Neodymium; Oceanography; Sea ice; Silt; % reductions; Antarctic climate; Deepwater; Marine isotope stages; Neodymium isotopes; Ocean circulation; Paleocirculation; Paleoclimates; Sortable silt; Southern ocean; Isotopes; bottom water; carbon dioxide; deep water; marine isotope stage; neodymium isotope; sea ice; water flow; Atlantic Ocean; Atlantic Ocean (North); Southern Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103946002

In addition, urban resource security would increase, the health of urban populations would improve and urban greenhouse gas emissions would be reduced. These are the principle goals under-pinning the circular city. Circular cities emerge through the process of circular development. Circular development alters cities’ systems of provision to enable circular practices of inhabitants to develop. This manifests as circular food systems and construction, water and nutrient recycling; adaptive reuse of spaces and pop-up activities; bioremediation of contaminated sites and integration of blue-green infrastructure throughout cities. To transform our cities will require significant investment, political support and public engagement. If the benefits of adopting such an approach can be identified, this will begin to make the case for support. The research presented in this paper draws on an inductive and deductive content analysis of relevant literature and interviews with those implementing circular projects in European cities (London, Paris, Amsterdam and Stockholm). It provides a clear definition of the normative concept of circular development. It creates a framework of benefits which are likely to accrue from adopting this approach. It points to the synergistic benefits emerging from circular development. It also highlights problems around valuation of those benefits, the unintended consequences of circular development and the inequalities in accessing benefits across society. © 2021 by the author.

Therefore, the demand for fertile planting substrates increases. Such substrates are usually mixed from mined geogenic resources but should rather be produced from recycled materials. Furthermore, their hydraulic properties should be designed according to their application, e.g., by optimizing the mixing ratio of their components. Therefore, this study introduces an approach to investigate the water retention curves (WRC) of soil-like substrates as a function of the mixing ratio of two recycled components: exemplarily for green waste compost (GWC) and ground bricks (GB) in the fraction of sand. Materials and methods: Seven mixing ratios for GWC and GB, 0/100, 18/82, 28/72, 37/63, 47/53, 68/32, and 100/0 have been packed to mixture-specific densities using a newly constructed packing device. The packing density resulted from applying six strokes with a constant momentum of 5.62 × 10−3 N s m−2 that was chosen according to the German green roof guideline. Thus, a standardized compaction was assured. The WRCs were measured using the simplified evaporation method in five replicates for each of the seven mixtures. A set of water retention models was parameterized and analyzed in regard to their suitability to represent the full range of binary mixtures. Results and discussion: The newly constructed packing device enables to pack cylinders reproducibly. The densities in the cylinders for the mixtures varied from 0.64 g cm−3 (GWC/GB = 100/0) to 1.35 g cm−3 (GWC/GB = 0/100) with a coefficient of variation less than 1.3%. The simplified evaporation method delivered homogeneous results for all five replicates of the investigated mixtures. The WRC of the seven mixtures is the result of a complex combination of the pore systems of GWC and GB. The multi-modal water retention models of Peters, Durner, and Iden are principally suitable to describe soil-like substrates that are rich in organic matter. The models PDI (van Genuchten) and PDI (Fredlund–Xing) best described the WRCs for the full range of mixing ratios according to the quality criterion RMSE. Conclusions: The study delivers a template how to prepare and analyze soil-like substrates regarding their WRCs using the simplified evaporation method. Complemented by total porosity and measurements at pF &gt; 4, it is a suitable method to gain high-resolution WRCs of soil-like substrates. Available water retention models are capable to describe the hydraulic behavior of binary mixtures over the full mixing ratio. Therefore, it would be possible to model the WRC of binary mixtures as a function of their mixing ratio. © 2020, The Author(s).","Binary mixtures; Simplified evaporation method; Soil-like substrates; Water retention function","artificial substrate; greenspace; hydraulic property; mixing ratio; soil water; water retention",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089027653

Over time several international organizations and networks have been added to the &quot;international carbon market web,&quot; such as several World Bank (WB) initiatives. As to the latter, the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition (CPLC) was launched in 2015. A key question then becomes: Considering an increasingly dense international environment, why was the Coalition formed? Our analysis shows the importance of taking into account institutional pathways in the Bank itself and the character of previous WB-internal initiatives. However, it is particularly important to note interaction with a strong external pull, stemming both from more &quot;systemic&quot; developments such as the collapse of the Clean Development Mechanism system and the explicit request for new initiatives from key actors, such as UN General Secretary Ban-Ki Moon. We suggest seeing entrepreneurship from the bureaucracies of international organizations as conditional on member-state behavior or a conducive institutional environment (or both). We also discuss main prospects ahead, both for the Coalition and the more general organizational set-up in this issue-area.

SO2 decreases began in the 1970s in the US and Europe and are expected to continue into the future, while recent emissions decreases in China are also projected to continue. In addition to the well-documented climate effects (warming) from reducing aerosols, tropospheric oxidation is impacted via aerosol modification of photolysis rates and radical sinks. Impacts on the hydroxyl radical and other trace constituents directly affect climate and air quality metrics such as surface ozone levels. We use the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Atmospheric Model version 3 nudged towards National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) reanalysis wind velocities to estimate the impact of SO2 emissions from the US, Europe, and China by differencing a control simulation with an otherwise identical simulation in which 2015 anthropogenic SO2 emissions are set to zero over one of the regions. Springtime sulfate aerosol changes occur both locally to the emission region and also throughout the Northern Hemispheric troposphere, including remote oceanic regions and the Arctic. Hydroperoxy (HO2) radicals are directly removed via heterogeneous chemistry on aerosol surfaces, including sulfate, in the model, and we find that sulfate aerosol produced by SO2 emissions from the three individual northern mid-latitude regions strongly reduces both HO2 and hydroxyl (OH) by up to 10% year-round throughout most of the troposphere north of 30 © 2021 EDP Sciences.

Hence, this paper introduced a geographically weighted regression model to explore the spatial heterogeneity of different driving factors for this industry's CO2 emissions. The empirical results show that standard coal consumption is a decisive factor affecting thermal power industry's CO2 emissions, and its response to the western region is at the forefront. The average utilization hours of thermal power equipment in the central region exert a profound impact, while the western region devotes a lot to the installed capacity, and these two variables have great potential for CO2 emission mitigation. However, the urbanization level and per capita electricity consumption have a slight effect on CO2 emissions. These findings furnish constructive reference and policy implications to achieve emission abatement targets of different regions. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.","CO2 emissions; GWR model; Thermal power industry","Carbon dioxide; Public policy; Regression analysis; Electricity-consumption; Geographically weighted regression models; Installed capacity; Policy implications; Spatial heterogeneity; Spatial heterogeneity analysis; Thermal power equipment; Urbanization levels; Coal industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106670251

However, disentangling stressor effects and identifying relevant stressor-effect-relationships in complex environmental settings remain major challenges. By combining state-of-the-art methods from ecotoxicology and aquatic ecosystem analysis, we aimed here to disentangle the effects of multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors along a longitudinal land use gradient in a third-order river in Germany. We distinguished and evaluated four dominant stressor categories along this gradient: (1) Hydromorphological alterations: Flow diversity and substrate diversity correlated with the EU-Water Framework Directive based indicators for the quality element macroinvertebrates, which deteriorated at the transition from near-natural reference sites to urban sites. (2) Elevated nutrient levels and eutrophication: Low to moderate nutrient concentrations together with complete canopy cover at the reference sites correlated with low densities of benthic algae (biofilms). We found no more systematic relation of algal density with nutrient concentrations at the downstream sites, suggesting that limiting concentrations are exceeded already at moderate nutrient concentrations and reduced shading by riparian vegetation. (3) Elevated organic matter levels: Wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and stormwater drainage systems were the primary sources of bioavailable dissolved organic carbon. Consequently, planktonic bacterial production and especially extracellular enzyme activity increased downstream of those effluents showing local peaks. (4) Micropollutants and toxicity-related stress: WWTPs were the predominant source of toxic stress, resulting in a rapid increase of the toxicity for invertebrates and algae with only one order of magnitude below the acute toxic levels. This toxicity correlates negatively with the contribution of invertebrate species being sensitive towards pesticides (SPEARpesticides index), probably contributing to the loss of biodiversity recorded in response to WWTP effluents. Our longitudinal approach highlights the potential of coordinated community efforts in supplementing established monitoring methods to tackle the complex phenomenon of multiple stress. © 2021 The Authors","Ecological functions; Effect based analyses; Indicators; Multiple stress; Running waters","Algae; Aquatic ecosystems; Biodiversity; Chemical analysis; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Coordination reactions; Environmental regulations; Enzyme activity; Eutrophication; Land use; Nutrients; Organic carbon; Quality control; River pollution; Sewage treatment plants; Toxicity; Urban growth; Wastewater treatment; Water conservation; Water quality; Dissolved organic carbon; Eu-water framework directives; Extracellular enzyme activity; Invertebrate species; Nutrient concentrations; State-of-the-art methods; Wastewater treatment plants; Water quality standard; Effluents; organic carbon; organic matter; pesticide; storm water; ecotoxicology; longitudinal gradient; lotic environment; stormwater; wastewater treatment plant; water quality; acute toxicity; aquatic environment; Article; benthos; biodiversity; biofilm; canopy; chemical analysis; chemical stress; controlled study; ecotoxicology; effluent; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; environmental stress; enzyme activity; European Union; eutrophication; Germany; government regulation; indicator organism; invertebrate; longitudinal study; macroinvertebrate; microbial activity; morphology; nonhuman; nutrient concentration; plankton; population density; riparian ecosystem; urban area; vegetation; waste water treatment plant; water flow; water pollutant; water quality; Germany; Bacteria (microorganisms); Invertebrata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100206028

Our approach combines time series reconstructions of societal and environmental variables from the southern Iberian Peninsula across a 3000 yr time interval (6000-3000 cal yr BP), covering major societal and climate reorganisation. Our approach is based on regional compilations of climate variables from diverse terrestrial archives and integrates new marine climate records from the Western Mediterranean. Archaeological variables include changes in material culture, settlement reconstructions and estimates of human activities.

This article summarizes the results from comparative tests of combustion and gasification of two complex plastic wastes: a plastic reject (PR) from processing recycled paper and an automotive shredder residue (ASR). Calculated gasification efficiencies corresponded to about 80% and 60%, respectively. Gasification resulted in lower yields of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/F) compared to direct combustion. A two-stage process, including gasification followed by syngas combustion, reduced the emissions of HCl and PCDD/F in the flue gas to <1.4% and <0.2%, respectively, compared to the levels from direct combustion of the PR feedstock. Most of the PCDD/F (>99%) was captured along with particulate matter (soot) during gasification. The contribution to the toxic concentration of PCDD/F was mainly from the PCDF congeners. Fly ash particulate matter from ASR combustion contained a significant proportion of zinc, which thus constitutes a great potential for use in zinc recycling. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical recycling; Chlorine; Dioxins; Gasification; Plastic waste; Syngas","Chlorine; Chlorine compounds; Fly ash; Gas emissions; Gasification; Municipal solid waste; Plastic recycling; Synthesis gas; Waste incineration; Zinc; Automotive shredder residues; Chemical recycling; Comparative tests; Direct combustion; High-temperature gasification; Oxygen-blown; Particulate Matter; Plastics waste; Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and dibenzofuran; Syn gas; Organic pollutants; chlorine; dibenzofuran; dioxin; hydrochloric acid; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; zinc; benzofuran derivative; plastic; polychlorinated dibenzodioxin; polychlorinated dibenzofuran; chlorine; combustion; comparative study; dioxin; plastic waste; recycling; Article; chemical recycling; combustion; comparative study; controlled study; fly ash; gasification; mathematical computing; particulate matter; plastic waste; recycling; soot; toxic concentration; incineration; Chlorine Compounds; Fly Ash; Gasification; Zinc; Benzofurans; Coal Ash; Dibenzofurans, Polychlorinated; Incineration; Plastics; Polychlorinated Dibenzodioxins",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102630812

Studying the response of the endophytic community to climate warming is a novel way to reveal the mechanism of host environmental adaptability because of the prominent role endophytes play in host nutrient acquisition and stress tolerance. However, host performance was generally neglected in previous relevant research, which limits our understanding of the relationships between the endophytic community and host responses to climate warming. The present study selected two plants with different responses to climate warming. Elymus nutans is more suitable for growing in warm environments at low altitude compared to Kobresia pygmaea. K. pygmaea and E. nutans were sampled along an altitude gradient in the natural grassland of Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. Root endophytic bacterial and fungal communities were analyzed using high throughput sequencing. The results revealed that hosts growing in more suitable habitats held higher endophytic fungal diversity. Elevation and host identity significantly affected the composition of the root endophytic bacterial and fungal community. 16S rRNA functional prediction demonstrated that hosts that adapted to lower temperatures recruited endophytic communities with higher abundance of genes related to cold resistance. Hosts that were more suitable for warmer and drier environments recruited endophytes with higher abundance of genes associated with nutrient absorption and oxidation resistance. We associated changes in the endophytic community with hosts adaptability to climate warming and suggested a synchronism of endophytic communities and hosts in environmental adaptation.

NZEB design considerations broadly categorize into energy infrastructure connections, renewable energy sources, and energy-efficiency measures. There is a lack of systematic literature review focused on recent progress in residential NZEBs. Therefore, this work provides an overview of each category including recent developments (last ≈ 10 years), aiming to provide references and support of wider and more successful implementation of residential NZEBs throughout the globe. The discussed energy infrastructure connections include electrical grids, district heating/cooling networks, and energy storage options including vehicle-to-home and hydrogen storage. Renewable energy sources considered here are solar photovoltaic and solar thermal, wind, and biomass including micro combined heat and power (CHP) systems. The final category detailed is energy-efficiency measures, which include improved building envelope designs, efficient HVAC systems, efficient domestic hot water systems, and phase change material integration. Within these categories there are many technology options, which makes selecting the ‘best’ configuration more difficult but allows design flexibility to adapt to local climates and other considerations (i.e. building codes, energy resources, costs).

Ross seals (Ommatophoca rossii) are the least studied of the Antarctic pinnipeds with a limited knowledge of their spatial ecology. We present the largest tracking study for this species to date, create the first habitat models, and discuss the potential impacts of climate change on their preferred habitat and the implications for conservation. We combined newly collected satellite tracking data (2016–2019: n = 11) with previously published data (2001: n = 8) from the Weddell, King Haakon VII and Lazarev seas, Antarctica, and used 16 remotely sensed environmental variables to model Ross seal habitat suitability by means of boosted regression trees for summer and winter, respectively. Five of the top environmental predictors were relevant in both summer and winter (sea-surface temperature, distance to the ice edge, ice concentration standard deviation, mixed-layer depth, and sea-surface height anomalies). Ross seals preferred to forage in waters ranging between −1 and 2°C, where the mixed-layer depth was shallower in summer and deeper in winter, where current speeds were slower, and away from the ice edge in the open ocean. Receding ice edge and shoaling of the mixed layer induced by climate change may reduce swimming distances and diving depths, thereby reducing foraging costs. However, predicted increased current speeds and sea-surface temperatures may reduce habitat suitability in these regions. We suggest that the response of Ross seals to climate change will be regionally specific, their future success will ultimately depend on how their prey responds to regional climate effects and their own behavioural plasticity. © Copyright © 2021 Wege, Bornemann, Blix, Nordøy, Biddle and Bester.","Antarctica; biologging; boosted regression trees models; climate change; habitat utilisation; remote sensing; species distribution model; Weddell Sea",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107054175

Despite abundant soil water availability, shallowly rooted vascular plants within peatlands may not be able to meet foliar demand for water under drought or heat events that increase vapor pressure deficits while reducing near surface water availability, although concurrent increases in atmospheric CO2 could buffer resultant hydraulic stress. We assessed plant water relations of co-occurring shrub (primarily Rhododendron groenlandicum and Chamaedaphne calyculata) and tree (Picea mariana and Larix laricina) species prior to, and in response to whole ecosystem warming (0 to +9°C) and elevated CO2 using 12.8-m diameter open-top enclosures installed within an ombrotrophic bog. Water relations (water potential [Ψ], turgor loss point, foliar and root hydraulic conductivity) were assessed prior to treatment initiation, then Ψ and peak sap flow (trees only) assessed after 1 or 2 years of treatments. Under the higher temperature treatments, L. laricina Ψ exceeded its turgor loss point, increased its peak sap flow, and was not able to recover Ψ overnight. In contrast, P. mariana operated below its turgor loss point and maintained constant Ψ and sap flow across warming treatments. Similarly, C. calyculata Ψ stress increased with temperature while R. groenlandicum Ψ remained at pretreatment levels. The more anisohydric behavior of L. laricina and C. calyculata may provide greater net C uptake with warming, while the more conservative P. mariana and R. groenlandicum maintained greater hydraulic safety. These latter species also responded to elevated CO2 by reduced Ψ stress, which may also help limit hydraulic failure during periods of extreme drought or heat in the future. Along with Sphagnum moss, the species-specific responses of peatland vascular communities to drier or hotter conditions will shape boreal peatland composition and function in the future. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","black spruce; boreal forest; climate change; hydraulic stress; sap flow; water potential","boreal forest; carbon monoxide; climate change; ombrotrophic environment; peatland; sap flow; vegetation dynamics; warming; water relations; Chamaedaphne calyculata; Larix laricina; Picea mariana; Rhododendron groenlandicum; Sphagnum; Tracheophyta; carbon dioxide; water; ecosystem; Larix; spruce; tree; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Larix; Picea; Trees; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101222140

Among the many available electrocatalyst materials, metal copper is the most common electrocatalyst material that can activate stable carbon dioxide molecules due to the suitable adsorption and desorption capabilities between its surface with active intermediates. What is more, the adsorbed intermediate species could undergo some C-C coupling reactions on the Cu surface to generate some high value-added hydrocarbons. However, the low Faraday efficiency, high overpotential, and low limiting current density of the target product in the catalytic process have been the main issues that plagued researchers. Various controlling strategies of the catalyst in the electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction reaction (ECDRR) have a great influence on the performance of the catalyst. Their morphology, composition, geometric structure, and electronic structure affect the role of local active sites and adsorption intermediates and ultimately result in different product distributions of electrocatalysts. Through the investigation and collation of related series of literature, this minireview gives examples of four types of Cu-based electrocatalysts commonly used in ECDRR, namely single metal-phase Cu catalyst, Cu-based bimetallic catalysts, oxide-derived Cu (OD-Cu) catalysts, and Cu-doped carbon-based (Cu-C) catalyst. The research progress of these four types of electrocatalysts in recent years is summarized in detail, and the strategies to improve their electrocatalytic activity are discussed to provide a reference for developing high-efficiency Cu-based ECDRR electrocatalysts. Finally, we put forward some challenges and opportunities that Cu-based materials would face in the development of ECDRR technology in the future. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Electrolysis; Electronic structure; Molecules; Morphology; Pollution control; Reaction intermediates; Surface reactions; Adsorbed intermediates; Adsorption and desorptions; C-C coupling reactions; Carbon dioxide reduction; Controlling strategies; Electrocatalytic activity; Limiting current density; Renewable electricity; Electrocatalysts",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106474620

Herein, for the first time, a novel superstructure of inverse spinel NiCoFe oxide nanocubes with contemporaneous valence regulation to preferred Co2+ and Ni3+ (NiIIICoIIFe-O@NF, NF stands for nickel foam), has been developed by in situ topotactic chemical transformation. NiIIICoIIFe-O@NF can attain a current density of 10 mA cm−2 at a low cell voltage of 1.455 V in 1 M KOH when used as bifunctional catalysts.

METHODS: Using the Environmental Policy Integrated Climate (EPIC) model, and drawing on 12 dynamically downscaled regional climate model (RCM) simulations, the impacts of climate change on crop yield, surface runoff, subsurface drainage, and dissolved reactive phosphorus (DRP) losses were determined for a field in the Lake Erie basin under a corn-soybean rotation receiving solid cattle manure fertilization. The combined and individual impacts of different weather variables were evaluated with each of the 12 simulations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The mean cross-model climate change impacts included 16% and 14% increases in corn and soybean yield, respectively, as well as 4% rise and 22% decline in runoff and subsurface drainage DRP, respectively, resulting in an overall 11% decline in total DRP losses. An increase of temperature alone increased crop yields (12% for corn and 8% for soybean, respectively) as it decreased temperature stress resulted from delayed planting, which also decreased total DRP loss by 19%. Regardless of having a negligible impact on yield due to negligible water stress, increased precipitation increased total DRP loss by 15%. SIGNIFICANCE: The research site could benefit from climate change in terms of both economic return and environmental quality, notwithstanding, greater attention should be paid to management practices with respect to soil DRP loss in surface runoff due to projected precipitation uncertainty. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate change; Crop yield; Dissolved reactive phosphorus loss; Regional climate modeling; Subsurface tile drainage; Surface runoff","agrometeorology; climate change; crop yield; drainage network; phosphorus; regional climate; runoff; soybean; subsurface flow; temperature profile; water quality; Canada; Great Lakes [North America]; Lake Erie; Glycine max",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101794090

Governments of various countries have invested huge resources to promote the rapid development of BEER market. However, when the amount of resource input exceeds a certain threshold, the market will deviate from the desired state, falling into a resource trap and cutting consumer welfare. This is due to the fact that BEER service providers take advantage of their dominant position in the market and increase their own revenues by enhancing product heterogeneity. To make matters worse, the greater the government's effort, the earlier the resource trap appears and the more resource loss it causes. Incentives and penalties for service providers became necessary to guide the market to cross resource trap.

Herein, chlorine-doped g-C3N4 photocatalysts (Cl-CN) were successfully synthesized by a simple multiple calcination method. The as-prepared Cl-CN exhibited satisfactory photocatalytic activity in photoreduction of CO2. The CO yield of Cl-CN was about 39.89 μmol/g. The DRS, UPS, and VB-XPS results indicated a narrower band gap, and the negatively shifted CB potential enhanced the CO2 reduction ability. DFT calculations and the partial density of states revealed that the Cl 3p orbital greatly contributed to the CBM and VBM of Cl-CN, which caused the narrower band gap and an upshift of the conduction band by 0.14 eV over that of bulk-CN. The CO2 conversion intermediate was investigated by in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and the corresponding reaction mechanism was proposed according to the density functional theory calculations and experimental results, which showed that Cl doping and the C-Cl bond increased the photogenerated carrier lifetime and the CO2 adsorption capacity of Cl-CN. Therefore, this work provides a deeper understanding of the effect of Cl doping on the g-C3N4 electronic structure and its CO2 reduction activity. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Carbon dioxide; Density functional theory; Electronic structure; Energy gap; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy; Photocatalytic activity; Reaction intermediates; Calcination method; High-efficiency; High-value chemicals; Partial density of state; Photo-reduction; Photocatalytic materials; Photogenerated carriers; Reaction mechanism; Chlorine",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106465590

However, the underlying mechanism and evidence of FDI impacts on carbon emissions have not been systematically explored. This study innovatively examines the mechanism of FDI on carbon emissions through energy intensity and the moderating effects of emissions trading system (EST) in the above process by constructing a dynamic spatial econometric model following the STIRPAT framework and the EKC hypothesis using the panel data of 30 provinces in mainland China from 2004 to 2016. It concludes that FDI is one reason that compels the increase in emissions in China's present stage. However, there exists a nonlinear relationship of the “inverted-U” shape between FDI and emissions, that is, as the ratio of FDI to GDP rises, the promotion effect of FDI on emissions will increase first and then decrease. Besides, FDI can also indirectly increase carbon emissions by promoting energy intensity. We further found that the ETS has a significant negative impact on carbon emissions, i.e., emissions in ETS pilot areas are less than those in non-pilot ones. Moreover, the ETS can reduce the increase of carbon emissions caused by FDI but cannot significantly influence the process that FDI affects emissions through energy intensity. Policy implications for China also are discussed, which can provide a guide for other developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon emissions; Dynamic spatial panel model; Emissions trading system; Energy intensity; Foreign direct investment","Commerce; Developing countries; Dynamics; Emission control; Investments; Public policy; Carbon emissions; Dynamic spatial; Dynamic spatial panel model; Economic growths; Emission trading systems; Energy emissions; Energy intensity; Foreign direct investments; Green technology; Moderating effect; Carbon; carbon emission; developing world; emissions trading; energy intensity; environmental economics; foreign direct investment; panel data; spatial data; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102274846

The results showed that Jingzhou and Jingmen achieved high EPRFE levels, whereas Shennongjia and Ezhou exhibited relatively low EPRFE levels. Moreover, the Wuhan Urban Agglomeration achieved higher net carbon emissions than western Hubei. Overall, EPRFE projects had positive effects on reducing net carbon emissions. The coupling degree between EPRFE levels and net carbon emissions was significantly high (0.85); however, the coordination degree was moderate (0.68) and needs further improvement.

Enhancing yield potential to meet the population explosion around the world and maintaining grain quality in wheat plants under climate change are crucial for food security and human nutrition. Global warming resulting from greenhouse effect has led to more frequent occurrence of extreme climatic events. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCO2 ) along with rising temperature has a huge impact on ecosystems, agriculture and human health. There are numerous studies investigating the eCO2 and heatwaves effects on wheat growth and productivity, and the mechanisms behind. This review outlines the state-of-the-art knowledge regarding the effects of eCO2 and heat stress, individually and combined, on grain yield and grain quality in wheat crop.

In this study, we applied a simulation technique on pollutant monitoring data to investigate the contribution of emission reduction (ERE) and meteorological effects (ME) to the improvement of air quality. We measured the daily PM2.5 concentrations during four months (representing the four seasons) in 2013 and 2018. We found that the concentrations of NH4+, NO3−, and SO42− decreased from 2013 to 2018, but the proportion of NO3− in PM2.5 showed an apparent increase. Multiple scenarios were simulated using the WRF-CAMx model to determine the impact of ERE and ME on air pollution. The results showed that both variables positively contributed to the annual air quality improvement, with ERE contributing more than 70% to the total PM2.5 reduction. However, their seasonal contributions showed notable differences. In winter, ME contributed more than 40 μg/m3 to the PM2.5 decrease, which was much higher than that in other seasons. This suggests that the positive effect of pollutant emission reduction on air quality may have been weakened under extremely adverse meteorological conditions. Hence, the monitoring and modeling results were coupled to evaluate the secondary conversion degree. We found that the emissions of precursors, including SO2 and NOx, notably decreased, but both the local and regional conversion degrees increased from 2013 to 2018. Therefore, for effective air pollution reduction, we suggest that future air pollution mitigation measures should focus on reducing secondary pollution in Beijing. © 2021 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air quality improvement; Emission reduction effect; Meteorological effect; Secondary conversion degree",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105444661

In order to reveal the structure and evolution characteristics of embodied carbon emission flow network among China’s industrial sectors, this study applies a complex network theory to construct six embodied carbon emission flow networks with 30 sectors on the basis of China’s input-output tables from 2002 to 2015. Through the analysis of complex network technology indicators, the overall structural characteristics of the network, the key sectors, and the key flow paths are analyzed. Main results show that six embodied carbon emission flow networks all have the small-world characteristics; there is an industrial cluster phenomenon in the network. During the study period, construction, manufacturing, and service-related industry community are the absorption sites for embodied carbon emissions. Coal- and petroleum-related industry communities are the divergent sites for embodied carbon emissions; moreover, electric and heat power and fuel processing are the important “suppliers” of embodied carbon emissions; construction and other service are the important “consumers” of embodied carbon emissions. Non-metallic products are the important “transmitters” of embodied carbon emissions. Metal smelting and chemical industry are at the core of the network because of their high weighted degree and betweenness centrality. The central effect of key sectors continues to increase over time; furthermore, the distribution of embodied carbon emission flows in the six networks all have long-tail characteristics, and this characteristic became more prominent over time. There are key edge-weights in the networks. About 11 to 15% of the edges carry 80% of the embodied carbon emissions. Further based on edge-weight analysis, this study identifies the key paths of embodied carbon emission flow in the six networks, and most key paths pass through construction. Thus, such key sectors and key flow paths should receive more attention when making carbon emission reduction policies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","China; Complex network; Embodied carbon emission flow; Input-output table; Sector","carbon emission; chemical industry; emission control; industrial emission; network analysis; pollution policy; China; carbon; carbon dioxide; China; commercial phenomena; industry; Carbon; Carbon Dioxide; China; Commerce; Industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099038700

This paper adopts the data of 290 prefecture-level cities in China to evaluate the air improvement effect of the central environmental inspection mechanism. Firstly, based on the Mechanism Design Theory and Principal-agent Theory, this paper analyzes the government incentive measures and effort levels under the conditions of information as symmetry and asymmetry. Then, this paper introduces Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) Model to evaluate the air improvement effect of the central environmental inspection mechanism. Lastly, this paper explores the sustainability of the environmental inspection mechanism through the regression analysis of environmental inspection revisit. The results show that: under the condition of information symmetry, the central government can make the local governments reach the Pareto optimal effort level through the design of incentive contract. In a short period of time, the first round of environmental inspection and environmental inspection revisit have significantly improved air quality, and significantly reduced PM2.5 and PM10 and other major single pollutants. In general, this system has had an immediate effect. The environmental inspection revisit has also significantly reduced the concentrations of AQI, PM2.5 and PM10. Compared with the first round of environmental inspection and environmental inspection revisit, the latter has a higher level of air pollution reduction and better effect. The sustainability of the improvement effect of environmental inspection mechanism is questioned.

The non-linearity of O3 formation with its precursors like nitrogen oxides (NOx D NO C NO2) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are complicating effective O3 abatement plans. The diagnosis from space-based observations, i.e. the ratio of formaldehyde (HCHO) columns to tropospheric NO2 columns (HCHO = NO2), has previously been proved to be highly consistent with our current understanding of surface O3 chemistry. HCHO = NO2 ratio thresholds distinguishing O3 formation sensitivity depend on regions and O3 chemistry interactions with aerosol. To shed more light on the current O3 formation sensitivity over China, we have derived HCHO = NO2 ratio thresholds by directly connecting satellite-based HCHO = NO2 observations and ground-based O3 measurements over the major Chinese cities in this study. We find that a VOC-limited regime occurs for HCHO = NO2 < 2.3, and a NOx-limited regime occurs for HCHO = NO2 > 4.2. The HCHO = NO2 between 2.3 and 4.2 reflects the transition between the two regimes. Our method shows that the O3 formation sensitivity tends to be VOC-limited over urban areas and NOx-limited over rural and remote areas in China. We find that there is a shift in some cities from the VOC-limited regime to the transitional regime that is associated with a rapid drop in anthropogenic NOx emissions, owing to the widely applied rigorous emission control strategies between 2016 and 2019. This detected spatial expansion of the transitional regime is supported by rising surface O3 concentrations. The enhanced O3 concentrations in urban areas during the COVID-19 lockdown in China indicate that a protocol with simultaneous anthropogenic NOx emissions and VOC emissions controls is essential for O3 abatement plans. © 2021 Author(s).",,"atmospheric pollution; formaldehyde; ground-based measurement; nitrogen oxides; ozone; satellite imagery; spatial variation; temporal variation; volatile organic compound; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105808649

The Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) instrument onboard the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) provides an unprecedented record of cloud ice measurements since its launch in April 2006. However, CALIPSO has left the A-Train in September 2018 and entered the C-Train orbit which follows a slightly different ground track with a different local crossing time. This orbit change challenges the continuation of a long-term record of cloud ice since ice is subject to stronger diurnal cycle. Fortunately, the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS), still as a member of the A-Train, has a consistent local crossing time and has measured high quality radiance since launch in 2004, and will probably continue beyond 2024. We present the use of MLS 640-GHz cloud-induced radiance (Tcir) to build a robust upper tropospheric partial ice water path (pIWP) product due to its high dynamical range to different sizes of ice particles. The MLS rebuilt pIWP, which extends nearly two decades, captures the spatial and temporal variabilities of upper tropospheric cloud ice that CALIOP is capable of measuring. This provides valuable alternative for studying the upper tropospheric cloud ice and possibly provides a more consistent input to climate studies. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

We construct a theoretical framework to analyse the impact of environmental regulation on air pollution by using balanced panel data from 2003 to 2016 of 248 Chinese cities. The results show that both formal and informal environmental regulations can significantly reduce air pollution in prefecture-level cities. Formal environmental regulation indirectly improves air pollution level by promoting technological innovation and formal environmental regulation indirectly reduces local air pollution by promoting the pollution industry transfer. In addition, informal environmental regulation indirectly reduces air pollution by improving formal environmental regulation. Moreover, formal and informal environmental regulations have inhibitory effects on air pollution in high administrative-level cities and low administrative-level cities, with both the regulations having significantly stronger inhibitory effects on air pollution in low administrative-level cities than in high administrative-level cities. Furthermore, the environmental Kuznets curve is established at the level of prefecture cities in China, and the upgrading of the industrial structure will reduce air pollution, while foreign direct investment and fiscal decentralisation will worsen air pollution. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Air pollution; Environmental regulation; Heterogeneity effect; Prefecture-level cities","atmospheric pollution; decentralization; economic growth; foreign direct investment; industrial structure; innovation; Kuznets curve; panel data; China; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; economic development; pollution; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Cities; Economic Development; Environmental Pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099581429

Therefore, catalyst support technology has been regarded as another effective tactic for improving the catalytic activities of catalysts. In the present study, ORR catalysts supported by composite materials were created by uniformly mixing super-conducting carbon black with tetra-β-(8-quinolinoxy) iron phthalocyanine-loaded reduced graphene oxides (rGO). The morphologic structures of the prepared material were investigated using AFM, SEM, FTIR, UV, XPS, and Raman spectroscopic methods. The catalytic activities and stabilities toward the ORR in alkaline electrolyte were assessed using CV and LSV processes. The experimental results demonstrated that insertions of the carbon black (CB) nanospheres between the rGO sheets not only impeded the stacking of the rGO nanosheets, but also achieved the full utilization of the synergistic effects between them. The improved electrochemical catalytic activities of the tetra-β-(8-quinolinoxy) iron phthalocyanine (TQFePc) via CB/rGO hybrid support were mainly attributed to the strong π-π interaction between the TQFePc molecules and the rGO nanosheets, as well as the novel 3D sandwiched graphene/carbon nanosphere/graphene structures. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Catalyst; Oxygen reduction reaction; Phthalocyanine; Reduced graphene oxide","Carbon black; Catalyst activity; Catalyst supports; Electrolytes; Electrolytic reduction; Nanosheets; Oxygen; Raman spectroscopy; Reaction rates; Spectroscopic analysis; Carbon black composites; Catalytic sites; Graphene oxide nanosheet; High-efficiency catalysts; Iron phthalocyanines; Oxygen reduction reaction; Phthalocyanine; Reduced graphene oxides; Stable catalysts; ]+ catalyst; Graphene; Carbon Black; Electrolytes; Oxygen; Raman Spectroscopy; Reaction Kinetics; Spectrochemical Analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102045578

Then, the policy corpus is fed to two different topic models, one is the Latent Dirichlet Allocation for modeling static policy topics, another is the Dynamic Topic Model for extracting topics over time. Finally, the obtained topics are mapped into policy tools for comparisons. The dynamic policy topics are further analyzed with the panel data from provincial new energy industries. The results show that the provincial new energy policies moved to different tracks after about 2014 due to the regional conditions such as the economy and CO2 emission intensity. Underdeveloped provinces tend to use environment-oriented tools to regulate and control CO2 emissions, while developed regions employ the more balanced policy mix for improving new energy vehicles and other industries. Widespread hysteretic effects are revealed during the correlation analysis of the policy topics and new energy capacity. Copyright: © 2021 Wang, Li.

To this end, the international 3E for 2000 and 2014, and nine indicators based on network analysis to dynamically study the changes in the degree of 3E impact between countries. And then, we analyzed the impact of the epidemic on the 3E of various countries, with focusing on the interaction between the United States and other countries. The results show that the internal carbon emission density and internal energy consumption density of the United States declined during 2010–2014, whereas the internal carbon emission density and internal energy consumption density of developing countries increased. Next, changes in US carbon emissions induced by the epidemic have a more significant impact on Canada, China, Mexico, the European Union, and Russia. Finally, the internal and external carbon emission indexes of most countries have decreased, which indicates that most countries are affected by the carbon reduction and energy consumption caused by the pandemic in the US.

Four different drought response (DR) schemes were implemented in the Model of Emissions of Gases and Aerosols from Nature (MEGAN, version 2.1), and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was applied to investigate the drought impacts on air quality during both drought and normal years in China. Generally, all DR schemes decrease isoprene emissions except for mild drought conditions. The significant decrease and even termination of isoprene emissions are predicted in South China under severe drought conditions. During the drought period, the DR scheme considering both mild and severe drought (SMD) improves the model performance especially in severe drought-hit regions when compared with the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) averaged formaldehyde vertical column density (HCHO VCD). The results show that most of the DR schemes decrease simulated ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA) levels.

Here, by combining observational data and simulations, this work aims to understand the diverse air quality response in two city clusters, Yangtze River Delta region (YRD) and Pearl River Delta region (PRD), China. Though there was a noticeable drop in primary pollutants in both the regions, differently, the maximum daily 8 h average ozone (O3) soared by 20.6-76.8% in YRD but decreased by 15.5-28.1% in PRD. In YRD, nitrogen oxide (NOx) reductions enhanced O3 accumulation and hence increased secondary aerosol formation. Such an increment in secondary organic and inorganic aerosols under stationary weather reached up to 36.4 and 10.2%, respectively, which was further intensified by regional transport. PRD was quite the opposite. The emission reductions benefited PRD air quality, while regional transport corresponded to an increase of 17.3 and 9.3% in secondary organic and inorganic aerosols, respectively. Apart from meteorology, the discrepancy in O3-VOCs-NOx relationships determined the different O3 responses, indicating that future emission control shall be regionally specific, instead of one-size-fits-all cut.

Grain yield, economic return, and carbon and nitrogen footprints of spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) were examined under different tillage-mulch practices. Wheat was grown over 15 years (2002–2016) in the semi-arid region of the western Loess Plateau of China under six tillage-mulch practices: traditional plough with no straw mulching (T), no-till without straw mulching (NT), traditional plough with straw mulching (TS), no-till without straw mulching (NTS), traditional plough with plastic mulching (TP), no-till with plastic mulching (NTP). Average wheat yield over 15 years under NTS, NTP, TP and TS was increased by 28, 24, 22, and 13%, respectively, compared to T. Average net return was greatest under NTS and lowest under TP. The soils under all six tillage-mulch practices gained a considerably large amount of soil organic carbon (SOC) over the 15 yr. The increase in SOC in the 0–30 cm soil layer was greatest under NTS and lowest under T. When changes in soil C were included in the calculations, treatments of NT, TS, NTS, and NTP sharply reduced total greenhouse gas (GHG) emission compared to T. Compared to T, the carbon footprint was decreased by 180, 44, and 123% under NTS, NT, and TS, respectively, but was increased by 153% under TP. Compared to T, the nitrogen footprint was 24–26% lower in TP and NTP, but was not significantly different under NTS, NT, and TS. Therefore, NTS enhanced yield and net return, and reduced GHG and the carbon footprint without increasing the nitrogen footprint, and should be adopted to mitigate the environmental impacts of wheat production in the semiarid Loess Plateau. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon footprint; Economic return; Nitrogen footprint; Tillage; Wheat","Agricultural machinery; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Arid regions; Economic and social effects; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Landforms; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Plants (botany); Sediments; Soils; Agricultural productions; Carbon and nitrogen; Economic benefits; Loess plateau of chinas; Nitrogen footprints; Semiarid Loess plateau; Soil organic carbon; Spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); Carbon footprint; organic carbon; agricultural economics; carbon footprint; crop yield; environmental management; mulching; nitrogen; tillage; trade-off; wheat; Article; carbon footprint; chemical analysis; China; crop production; economics; nitrogen footprint; particle size; priority journal; tillage; China; Loess Plateau; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100568637

This study will provide the baseline simulation for a future work to investigate the impacts of both climate and emission changes on the future regional air quality and human health. This paper focuses on the current year simulation design, comprehensive model evaluation, and sensitivity simulations that demonstrate the impacts of different reinitialization setup, cloud physical schemes, and emission inventories on the model predictions. Nine one-month sensitivity simulations by using different reinitialization setup and cloud microphysics and cumulus parameterizations are first conducted to provide the optimal model configurations. The model performance in predicting the regional meteorology and air quality on a decadal scale is further evaluated against available surface, satellite, and reanalysis data. The decadal WRF/Chem simulation by using NEI emissions (referred to as simulation NEI) performs well for major meteorological variables such as T2, RH2, WS10, and precipitation and shows good performance for major radiation variables such as SWDOWN, OLR, and SWCF. Large model biases still exist for cloud variables due to limitations of cloud dynamics/thermodynamics treatments and uncertainties associated with satellite retrievals. The simulation NEI also predicts O3 and PM2.5 well in terms of spatiotemporal distribution. Compared to a previous study using the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5) emissions, the simulation NEI performs better for most of variables, especially for precipitation and cloud radiative forcing due to better representation of cloud processes and also for O3 and PM2.5 in terms of spatiotemporal variations due to more accurate emission inventory. The evaluation results in this work are within the range or better than other previous studies using the WRF/Chem model and lay the foundation for more realistic projection of future climate and air quality in the future work. © 2021","Climatological evaluation; Continental U.S.; Decadal simulation; NEI; RCP; WRF/Chem","Atmospheric radiation; Climate models; Clouds; Precipitation (meteorology); Quality control; Climatological evaluation; Continental US; Decadal simulation; Model evaluation; National emissions inventories; RCP; Reinitialization; Sensitivity Simulation; Simulation Design; WRF/Chem; Air quality; air quality; climate change; climate modeling; climatology; decadal variation; emission inventory; public health; sensitivity analysis; simulation; air quality; article; controlled study; human; information retrieval; meteorology; particulate matter 2.5; precipitation; prediction; radiative forcing; simulation; thermodynamics; uncertainty; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103309779

In most cases, a local test is used to identify significant changes at individual locations, which is then followed by a field significance test that considers the number of locations in a region with locally significant changes. The choice of local test can affect the result, potentially leading to conflicting assessments of the impact of climate change on a region. We demonstrate that when considering changes in the annual extremes of daily precipitation, the simple Mann-Kendall trend test is preferred as the local test over more complex likelihood ratio tests that compare the fits of stationary and nonstationary generalized extreme value distributions. This lesson allows us to report, with enhanced confidence, that the intensification of annual extremes of daily precipitation in China since 1961 became field significant much earlier than previously reported. © 2021.

However, how different kinds of GHGs respond to various warming magnitudes remains largely unclear, especially in the cold regions that are more sensitive to climate warming. Here, we concurrently measured carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes and their total balance in an alpine meadow in response to three levels of warming (ambient, +1.5 °C, +3.0 °C). We found warming-induced increases in CH4 uptake, decreases in N2O emissions and increases in CO2 emissions at the annual basis. Expressed as CO2-equivalents with a global warming potential of 100 years (GWP100), the enhancement of CH4 uptake and reduction of N2O emissions offset only 9% of the warming-induced increase in CO2 emissions for 1.5 °C warming, and only 7% for 3.0 °C warming. CO2 emissions were strongly stimulated, leading to a significantly positive feedback to climate system, for 3.0 °C warming but less for 1.5 °C warming. The warming with 3.0 °C altered the total GHG balance mainly by stimulating CO2 emissions in the non-growing season due to warmer soil temperatures, longer unfrozen period, and increased soil water content. The findings provide an empirical evidence that warming beyond global 2 °C target can trigger a positive GHG-climate feedback and highlight the contribution from non-growing season to this positive feedback loop in cold ecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 emissions; Cold ecosystem; Greenhouse gas balance; Non-growing season; Warming magnitude","Carbon dioxide; Gas emissions; Global warming; Nitrogen oxides; Soil moisture; Climate feedbacks; Climate system; Climate warming; Global warming potential; Growing season; Positive feedback loop; Soil temperature; Soil water content; Greenhouse gases; carbon dioxide; methane; nitrous oxide; alpine environment; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; global warming; greenhouse gas; meadow; methane; trace element; ambient air; Article; carbon footprint; climate warming; controlled study; crop production; environmental temperature; greenhouse gas; growing season; microclimate; priority journal; soil analysis; soil property; soil temperature; soil water content",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099522583

The reduction rate depends on temperature, on the presence of base (NEt3) and on the P/Rh ratio. For CCMs with outer shells made of neutral P(MAA-co-PEOMA) copolymer chains (RhNP@CCM-N), the core-generated Rh NPs tend to migrate toward the hydrophilic shell and to agglomerate depending on the P/Rh ratio and core TPP density, whereas the MAA protonation state has a negligible effect. Conversely, CCMs with outer shells made of polycationic P(4VPMe+I-) chains (RhNP@CCM-C) maintain core-confined and well dispersed Rh NPs. All RhNP@CCMs were used as catalytic nanoreactors under aqueous biphasic conditions for acetophenone, styrene and 1-octene hydrogenation. Styrene was efficiently hydrogenated by all systems with high selectivity for vinyl reduction. For acetophenone, competition between benzene ring and carbonyl reduction was observed as well as a limited access to the catalytic sites when using CCM-C. Neat 1-octene was also converted, but the activity increased when the substrate was diluted in 1-nonanol, which is a better core-swelling solvent. Whereas the molecular RhI center was more active than the Rh0 NPs in 1-octene hydrogenation, the opposite trend was observed for styrene hydrogenation. Although Rh NP migration and agglomeration occurred for RhNP@CCM-N, even at high P/Rh, the NPs remained core-confined for RhNP@CCM-C, but only when toluene rather than diethyl ether was used for product extraction before recycling. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Benzene refining; Hydrogenation; Ketones; Latexes; Micelles; Nanoparticles; Nanoreactors; Rhodium compounds; Styrene; Swelling; Biphasic conditions; Carbonyl reduction; Core cross-linked micelles; Hydrogenation catalysis; Hydrophilic shell; Rhodium nanoparticles; Styrene hydrogenation; Triphenyl phosphines; Synthesis (chemical)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105548302

It is common to have trace levels of uranium-bearing minerals (naturally occurring radioactive material, NORM) in sandstone saline aquifers and CO2 injection may cause uranium mobilization due to the coupled chemical and physical interactions at mineral-water interfaces. In this study, we developed a TOUGHREACT model to assess the uranium mobilization potential from uraninite (UO2) dissolution induced by CO2 injection into a hypothetical CO2 storage reservoir with Fe(III)-bearing hematite in a time scale of 30 years CO2 injection and 100 years after CO2 injection. Numerical simulation results show that injection of CO2 reduced pH and induced small amounts of hematite dissolution, which released Fe3+ into aqueous phase. Fe3+ together with dissolved bicarbonate species caused oxidative dissolution of UO2 (Fe3+ serving as an oxidant), resulting in an increase of dissolved uranium concentrations in the CO2 storage reservoir. However, the released uranium was limited to a small region close to Fe3+ supply source and the maximum concentration of released uranium was only 9.00 × 10−10 mol/kg in the CO2 storage reservoir at t = 30 years. The availability of Fe3+ is the main factor that limits mineralized uranium release because the pH drop induced by CO2 injection is not low enough to cause significant Fe3+ release. For sorbed uranium, the main factor that influences sorbed uranium release is pH because uranium sorption is amphoteric. Based on our simulation results, the pH range in the CO2 storage reservoir does not cause a substantial release of sorbed uranium. Also, the potential for released uranium to migrate through a permeable zone in the caprock to the layer above the caprock and cause groundwater contamination is negligible. In summary, results from this study imply a very low risk of environmental contamination by bicarbonate and Fe(III)-induced uranium mobilization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbonate complexation; Geologic carbon storage; Groundwater contamination; Reactive transport modeling; TOUGHREACT; Uranium","Aquifers; Beverages; Carbon dioxide; Contamination; Dissolution; Groundwater pollution; Groundwater resources; Hematite; Hydrogeology; Radioactive materials; Reservoirs (water); Saline water; Storage (materials); Uranium dioxide; Environmental contamination; Groundwater contamination; Maximum concentrations; Mineral-water interface; Mobilization potential; Naturally occurring radioactive materials; Oxidative dissolution; Uranium concentration; Uranium; aquifer; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; carbon storage; carbonate; complexation; dissolution; element mobility; groundwater pollution; iron; mobilization; radioactive pollution; reactive transport; risk assessment; underground storage; uraninite; uranium",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100631270

This study was carried out to investigate whether ryegrass serving as cover crop affects soil N2O emissions and denitrifier community size. A microcosm experiment was conducted with soil planted with perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) and bare soil, each with four levels of N fertilizer (0, 5, 10 and 20 g N m−2; applied as calcium ammonium nitrate). The closed-chamber approach was used to measure soil N2O fluxes. Real-time PCR was used to estimate the biomass of bacteria and fungi and the abundance of genes involved in denitrification in soil. The results showed that the presence of ryegrass decreased the nitrate content in soil. Cumulative N2O emissions of soil with grass were lower than in bare soil at 5 and 10 g N m−2. Fertilization levels did not affect the abundance of soil bacteria and fungi. Soil with grass showed greater abundances of bacteria and fungi, as well as microorganisms carrying narG, napA, nirK, nirS and nosZ clade I genes. It is concluded that ryegrass serving as a cover crop holds the potential to mitigate soil N2O emissions in soils with moderate or high NO3− concentrations. This highlights the importance of cover crops for the reduction of N2O emissions from soil, particularly following N fertilization. Future research should explore the full potential of ryegrass to reduce soil N2O emissions under field conditions as well as in different soils. Highlights: This study was to investigate whether ryegrass serving as cover crop affects soil N2O emissions and denitrifier community size; Plant reduced soil N substrates on one side, but their root exudates stimulated denitrification on the other side; N2O emissions were lower in soil with grass than bare soil at medium fertilizer levels, and growing grass stimulated the proliferation of almost all the denitrifying bacteria except nosZ clade II; Ryegrass serving as a cover crop holds the potential to mitigate soil N2O emissions. © 2020 The Authors.

Site-specific seven-year mean gravimetric PM2.5 mass concentrations ranged from 5.7 to 9.6 µg/m3. Seven-year mean concentrations of SO42−, NO3−, NH4+, organic carbon (OC), and elemental carbon (EC) were in the range of 0.68 to 1.6, 0.21 to 1.5, 0.27 to 0.71, 1.1 to 1.9, and 0.37 to 0.71 µg /m3, accounting for 10.8%-18.1%, 3.7%-16.7%, 4.7%-7.4%, 18.4%-21.0%, and 6.4%-10.6%, respectively, of gravimetric PM2.5 mass. PM2.5 and its five major chemical components showed higher concentrations in southeastern Canada and lower values in Atlantic Canada, with the seven-year mean ratios between the two regions being on the order of 1.7 for PM2.5 and 1.8-7.1 for its chemical components. When comparing the concentrations between urban and rural sites within the same region, those of SO42− and NH4+ were comparable, while those of NO3−, OC, and EC were around 20%, 40%-50%, and 70%-80%, respectively, higher at urban than rural sites, indicating the regional scale impacts of SO42− and NH4+ and effects of local sources on OC and EC.

The ceilometer and DIAL measurements capture the vertical extent of the smoke plumes affecting the surface and upper air over Huntsville, AL. The model evaluation results suggest a scaling factor of 3–4 for the wildfire aerosol emissions in order to better match observed aerosol optical depth, fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and DIAL aerosol extinction. We use the scaled emissions together with WRF-Chem tendency diagnostics to quantify the fire impacts and characterize the processes affecting the vertical ozone budget downstream of the wildfires. During the daytime at Huntsville on November 12 and 13, we estimate that fire emissions contribute 12–32 μg/m3 (44%–70%) to hourly surface PM2.5 and 7–8 ppb/10 h (30%–37%) to the surface ozone increase (ΔO3), respectively. Net chemical ozone production (PO3) is the main contributor to upper-air ozone, which reaches 17–19 ppb/10 h with an estimated 14%–25% contribution from fire sources. Vertical mixing and advection are the major drivers of changes in surface ozone. Model analysis indicates that advection dominates ΔO3 due to fire emissions below 1 km on November 12, while local photochemistry dominates on November 13. These results quantify the different mechanisms through which fires can influence the vertical ozone budget and point out uncertainties in fire inventories that need to be addressed in light of the increasing role of wildfires on air quality. © 2021.

The traditional methods for estimating marginal emission abatement costs do not account for technological heterogeneity, which leads to biased results. To solve this problem, an improved method that combines the clustering method with a parametric output directional distance function is proposed in this paper. This method integrates the economic proximity of each examined province into its assessment of the environmental production technology of the province and takes multiple pollutants (CO2, SO2 and NOX) into consideration. Based on this method, in this paper, the environmental performance of 30 provinces in China from 2006 to 2017 is measured, the marginal emission abatement cost of CO2 is estimated, and a nonlinear programming method is used to study the optimal allocation of emission reduction in China. The results indicate the following: First, categorizing the provinces according to their economic proximity results in groups that differ greatly from geographically based groups. Second, the average inefficiency of these 30 Chinese provinces is 2.551%, which is less than that estimated by the methods that do not consider heterogeneity. Third, China's average marginal CO2 abatement cost is 797.79 CNY/ton, and it exhibits a growing trend. Finally, compared to the grandfathering rule, the optimal quota allocation proposed by this paper can save approximately 797.793 billion CNY. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Economic proximity; Emission reduction allowance; Heterogeneity; Marginal emission abatement cost; Output directional distance function; Technical inefficiency","Carbon dioxide; Cost estimating; Environmental management; Environmental technology; Nonlinear programming; Clustering methods; Economic proximity; Emission reduction; Emission reduction allowance; Emission trading markets; Emissions abatement costs; Heterogeneity; Marginal emission abatement cost; Output directional distance function; Technical inefficiency; Emission control; abatement cost; biomass allocation; carbon dioxide; cost analysis; emission control; emissions trading; environmental assessment; heterogeneity; nonlinearity; parameterization; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102133698

In the paper, a multi-agent-theory-based simulation model is established and the impact of three different emission reduction strategies, namely, a shore power system, switching to low-sulfur marine fuels, and increasing quay crane efficiency on container ports’ emission reduction and their associated costs are analyzed with a case study of the Shekou Container Terminal in China. The objective is to lay a theoretical foundation for government to optimize its pollution reducing strategies with costs and emission reduction target considered. The results show that the shore power system achieves the highest comprehensive emission reduction effect for only one strategy adopted. A combination of shore power system and increasing quay crane efficiency has the highest emission reduction potential for pair strategies adopted. All three strategies combined acquire the most significant emission reduction and there is no negative correlation among these three strategies. From the perspective of economic benefits, a low-sulfur fuel oil strategy achieves the best performance in carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide reductions. The research also suggests that if government has sufficient fund, usage of shore power system should be given priority; otherwise, a low-sulfur fuel oil measure is suggested. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Containership; Economic benefit; Emission reduction; Low-sulfur marine fuel; Shore power","Carbon dioxide; Containers; Cost reduction; Economic and social effects; Efficiency; Fuel oils; Multi agent systems; Port terminals; Railroad yards and terminals; Sulfur dioxide; Case-studies; Container ships; Container terminal; Economic benefits; Emission reduction; Emission reduction strategy; Low sulfur fuels; Low-sulphur marine fuel; Quay cranes; Shore power; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103690821

In this study, we investigated the significance of ITV in identifying the processes that shape the development of forest understory plant communities in an area in which excessive herbivory by overabundant deer populations has been an issue. We measured functional traits (height, leaf area, leaf mass per area, leaf dry matter content, and leaf toughness) of 13 forest floor plant species growing in two contrasting sites in which deer were overabundant or had been completely excluded, respectively, and examined the relationships between species dominance and interspecific trait variation and ITV. We detected variations in the trait plasticity of size and morphological features among species, reflecting species-specific strategies in response to herbivory and consequently observed marked differences in species composition and diversity at the two sites. Notably, small stature and less costly leaves were identified as important traits that enable plants to persist under conditions of intense deer herbivory probably because such plants are less exposed to herbivory and simultaneously optimize carbon assimilation. In contrast, large-sized plants with costly leaves tended to dominate the plant community in the absence of deer herbivory, as these plants would tend to gain a competitive advantage with respect to the acquisition of space and light. The findings of this study indicate that a focus on ITV represents a promising approach for determining the general ecological patterns of plant communities responding to environmental disturbance. © 2021 The Ecological Society of Japan.","deer herbivory; intraspecific trait variation; plant carbon economy; plant community; plant strategy","community composition; deer; dominance; forest floor; herbivory; interspecific interaction; morphology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104358149

In this platform, carbonic anhydrase (CA) enzyme is employed to accelerate the sequestration of CO2. The present work explored the effect of chaperone GroELS and TrxA-tag on improving soluble expression of the recombinant Sulfurihydrogenibium yellowstonense CA which activity and biomineralization capability were taken into consideration. At first, the expression of GroELS using the inducible T7 promoter and constitutive J23100 promoter were investigated. The results indicated that 1.4 folds increment of soluble protein and 100% of CA activity enhancement were achieved with GroELS co-expression driven by J23100 promoter. Furthermore, the involvement of TrxA fusion tag displayed a significant enhancement of soluble protein production which was about 2.67 times higher than that of original SyCA. Besides, co-expression with GroELS intensified the thermostability of SyCA at 60 °C owing to changes in the structural conformation of the protein, which was proved by an in vitro assay. The SyCA was further entrapped and immobilized into polyacrylamide gel (i.e., PAGE-SyCA). The biomineralization capability of the PAGE-SyCA and whole-cell (WC) was compared in a two-column system. After 5 cycles of reuse, PAGE-SyCA maintained 29.8% activity and formed 774 mg of CaCO3 solids in the B::JG strain.

The contribution of New and Renewable Energy to the national energy mix is mandated to reach 23 % by 2025. Indonesia's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) stresses five sectors in which greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are to be reduced with forestry and energy being the highest priority. While Indonesia is committed to address climate change through the forestry sector, there are clearly contextual challenges that need to be addressed to create the enabling conditions for REDD+. Biomass production for local energy supply in remote and rural areas could become the agent of change for this difficult problem. This paper proposes a methodology for rural electrification using a community and biomass-based power generation system exemplified by a real case in the Mentawai islands in Indonesia. By replicating this proven system that results in biomass production, land restoration, affordable electricity, and local economic growth, the contribution of renewable energy in the energy mix and the overall prosperity of Indonesians in rural and remote areas can be improved. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Climate change; Ecology; Economics; Electric utilities; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Population statistics; Rural areas; Timber; Biomass productions; Economic growths; Forestry sector; Power generation systems; Primary energy demand; Renewable energies; Rural and remote areas; Rural electrification; Biomass",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107216314

Pakistan is highly vulnerable to CC. In this paper, the extent to which Pakistan’s national and provincial water, agriculture, and energy sector policies, development plans and strategies are aligned in a CC policy coherent manner is established. In this context, a qualitative content document analysis with associated scoring is used to assess government documents. Furthermore, implications of the China–Pakistan Economic Corridor Initiative (CPEC; 2017–2030), the biggest infrastructure investment program ever in Pakistan, are discussed. An important result is that sectoral policies are found to have different degrees of PC. Better coherence is found at federal than at provincial levels. Furthermore, CC policies are found to be more coherently addressed in water and agriculture policies than in energy policies. It is suggested that to achieve higher levels of CC PC, federal and provincial governments should establish mechanisms of intergovernmental consultation for policy-making and cross-sectoral planning, especially in the energy sector. Our findings can help the Government of Pakistan to transform CPEC into a model green Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in the region. In this context, there are important implications with regards to e.g., reducing coal-based energy projects and environmentally damaging infrastructure activities in sensitive ecosystems. With this paper, the authors want to raise awareness of the key importance of CC PC, particular in context of the BRI. Many countries participating in the initiative have carbon reduction targets in place. © 2021, The Author(s).","Adaptation and mitigation; Climate change policy coherence; CPEC; Pakistan","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Climate change; Coal industry; Energy policy; Investments; Carbon reduction; Climate change policies; Development plans; Document analysis; Government documents; Infrastructure investment; Mitigation policies; Sectoral policies; Public policy; water; adaptive management; climate change; economic analysis; environmental policy; government; infrastructure planning; mitigation; planning practice; strategic approach; agriculture; Article; China; climate change; energy; environmental policy; government; human; Pakistan; qualitative analysis; risk management; water management; ecosystem; policy; China; Pakistan; China; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Pakistan; Policy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102930943

Among numerous portfolios to address the serious problems caused by this major greenhouse gas, CO2 capture and utilization remain one of the most interesting solutions. In this regard, the staggering CO2 effluents present in the atmosphere could become an abundant chemical feedstock if they were converted into valuable products. Catalytic hydrogenation of CO2 into value-added chemicals and alternative fuels is one of the appealing green strategies to valorize this carbon-containing feedstock, while also contributing to alleviate the global CO2 emissions. This state-of-the-art review highlights a wide range of heterogeneous catalysts and innovative processes for direct CO2 hydrogenation into CO, methanol (MeOH), and dimethyl ether (DME). To overcome catalyst deactivation and improve catalytic performance, we discuss active phases in detail and emphasize the preparation methods, catalytic supports, metal-based catalysts, and synergistic effects. Another essential hurdle is low CO2 conversion related to the thermodynamical stability of CO2, which restricts its use as a reagent on an industrial scale. The state-of-the-art sorption-enhanced process reveals that, by choosing an appropriate water sorbent, it is feasible to overcome the thermodynamic limitation. Therefore, the later part of this review focusses on recent modelling and experimental applications of this integrated process in CO2 hydrogenation for the synthesis of CO, MeOH, and DME. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","CO; CO2 valorization by catalytic hydrogenation; Dimethyl ether; Methanol; Sorption-Enhanced intensified process","Alternative fuels; Catalyst deactivation; Cobalt; Ethers; Feedstocks; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogenation; Methanol; Sorption; Anthropogenic carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxides (CO); Catalytic hydrogenation; CO; CO methanol; CO$-2$/ emission; CO2 valorization by catalytic hydrogenation; Dimethyl ether; Material development; Sorption-enhanced intensified process; Carbon dioxide",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103767499

Regulating emissions associated with delivered electricity is further complicated by contractual arrangements for dynamic electricity transfers that confound emission accounting approaches rooted in the physics of grid operations. Here, we propose a novel consumption-based accounting methodology to reconcile the nominal and the physical flows of electricity from generators to consumers. We also compare capacity factor-based and regression-based approaches for estimating default emission factors, in the absence of fully specified nominal electricity flows. As a case study, we apply this approach to assess the methods by which California regulators quantify specified and unspecified electricity imports and their associated GHG emissions. Collectively, these efforts illustrate principles for a comprehensive, empirical accounting framework that could inform efforts to improve the accuracy and consistency of policies regulating regional electricity transfers. ©","climate policy; electricity imports; emission intensity; Greenhouse gas accounting","Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Capacity factors; Climate policy; Contractual arrangements; Default emission factors; Electricity imports; Electricity transfer; Grid operation; Regulatory jurisdictions; Electric power system interconnection; carbon emission; electricity; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; article; California; carbon footprint; climate; consumer; electricity; human; quantitative analysis; climate; electricity; greenhouse effect; greenhouse gas; physical phenomena; Climate; Electricity; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Physical Phenomena",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106554702

Despite the inclusion of an explicit biodiversity objective in the NGP, the Philippine government is struggling to implement projects that explicitly address biodiversity recovery. Using a case-study methodology, we identified three constraints that obstruct achievement of the NGP's biodiversity conservation goals: 1) a focus on planting targets; 2) disregard for established community-based forestry practices; and 3) poor planning, organization, and implementation. These factors restricted establishment of diverse plantings suited to biodiversity recovery. Poor governance emerged as an overarching issue that connects each of these factors. Specific regulatory guidelines clearly need to be added to existing policy frameworks to assist planners and practitioners in the implementation of biodiversity-focused projects. Our results also indicate that these three factors and governance limitations, which impede attainment of biodiversity objectives, also affect production goals of the program. It is evident that establishing species-rich projects alone will benefit biodiversity little unless broader steps are taken to improve implementation processes across the NGP. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Biodiversity-focused plantings; FLR; Governance; NGP; Reforestation; Regulatory frameworks","biodiversity; climate change; governance approach; nature conservation; reforestation; regulatory framework; Philippines",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85075424494

Restoration efforts such as sod-cutting (removal of vegetation, litter and humus layer) often shifted these systems from N to P limitation and have had limited success in restoring the invertebrate community. Possible reasons for this include the unresolved acidification and a change in food plant stoichiometry. Here, we investigate how liming and P addition change food nutritional quality and their consequences for invertebrate performance. Methods: We performed feeding experiments with field crickets (Gryllus campestris), using plant material collected from a full factorial field experiment with liming and P addition. We related female reproduction as measure of individual fitness to elemental ratios of plants fed to the crickets. Results: P addition stimulated cricket daily reproduction and shortened their reproductive period, resulting in no difference in total reproduction. Liming greatly reduced both daily and total reproduction and resulted in more females cannibalizing on their male mates. Females that did so could partly offset the liming induced reduction in reproduction, suggesting dietary deficiency. P-addition improved food quality (lower N:P ratios) while liming led to skewed Mn:Mg and Fe:Mg ratios that compare unfavorably to ratios found in terrestrial invertebrates. Conclusion: Increased plant N:P ratio following sod-cutting constrains the reproductive potential in Gryllus campestris in a non-linear way. Liming reduced nutritional quality, likely by inducing deficiencies in Fe or Mn. Management Implications: High-impact restoration management practices such as sod cutting and liming cause new problems for invertebrates rooted in ecological stoichiometry. Since P-addition only partially offsets these negative effects, we instead advocate the use of less intensive N removal management and weaker buffering agents to reduce soil acidification. Furthermore, a reduction in N emission is paramount as it will remove the need for disruptive interventions. © Copyright © 2021 Vogels, Verberk, Kuper, Weijters, Bobbink and Siepel.","acidification; ecological stoichiometry; elemental ecology; insect decline; invertebrate diversity; nitrogen deposition; restoration management; sod-cutting",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107191397

Estimates of the magnitude of the effect of particulate air pollution on mortality are generally done on a coarse spatial scale, such as 0.5°, and may fail to capture small spatial differences in exposure and baseline rates, which can bias results and impede the ability to consider environmental justice. We estimated the burden of mortality attributable to long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 among adults in the Continental United States on a 1 km scale, in order to provide information for decision makers setting health priorities. Methods: We conducted a health impact assessment for 2015 using a model predicting U.S. PM2.5 concentrations at a spatial resolution of 1 km cells. We applied a concentration-response curve from a recently published meta-analysis of long-term PM2.5 mortality association which incorporates new findings at high and low PM2.5 concentrations. We computed the change in deaths in each grid cell, based on its grid cell population, Zip code level baseline mortality rates, and exposure under two scenarios; a decrease of PM2.5 exposure levels by 40% and a decrease of PM2.5 exposure levels to the county minimum PM2.5 concentrations. Results: We estimated the deaths would fall by 104,786 (95% CI 57,016–135,726) and 112,040 (95% CI 63,261-159,116) attributable to 40% reduction and reduction to the county minimum PM2.5 concentrations, respectively. The greatest mortality impact due to 40% reduction in PM2.5 was observed in California with; 11,621 (95% CI; 7156-15,989) and Texas with; 9616 (95% CI; 5798–13,352) excess deaths attributable to annual mean PM2.5 concentrations of 9.54 and 9.12 μg m−3, respectively. Within city analyses showed substantial heterogeneity in risk. The estimated Attributable fraction (AF %) in locations with high PM2.5 levels was 8.6% (95% CI 5.4–11.7) compared to the overall AF% of 4.9% (95% CI; 2.9–6.8). In comparison, results using county average PM2.5 were smaller than the estimates from the 1 km PM2.5 datasets. Similarly, estimates using county-level mortality rates were smaller than estimates based on Zip-code level mortality rates. Conclusions: Our study provides evidence of major health benefits expected from reducing PM2.5 exposure, even in regions with relatively low PM2.5 concentrations. Spatial characteristics of exposure and baseline mortality (e.g., accuracy, scales, and variations) in disease burden studies can significantly impact the results. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",,"atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); health impact; heterogeneity; meta-analysis; mortality risk; particulate matter; pollution exposure; spatial resolution; adult; aged; all cause mortality; ambient air; Article; California; cause of death; cell population; clinical assessment; comparative study; concentration process; concentration response; controlled study; disease association; geographic distribution; grid cell; health care planning; health impact assessment; high spatiotemporal resolution model; human; long term exposure; machine learning; meta analysis (topic); mortality rate; outcome assessment; particulate matter; PM2.5 exposure; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; spatiotemporal analysis; United States; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; analysis; city; environmental exposure; epidemiology; meta analysis; mortality; Texas; toxicity; California; Texas; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Mortality; Particulate Matter; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101841879

This tool has been used successfully in several sectors and contexts such as coastal and river adaptation, urban heat waves, floods and rural livelihoods but its use in natural resource management, has faced several challenges and limitations. In the sector of agroforestry its use has seldom been done or documented and one of the reasons for this may due to some of its specific challenges. In this study, these challenges were addressed when using the Adaptation Pathways for the adaptation planning of three case studies in the semi-arid Alentejo region, a Mediterranean dryland of southern Portugal. This tool was integrated in a participatory approach combined with the Scenario Workshop method, to plan the adaptation of the agriculture and forestry sector of one municipality (Mértola) and two agroforestry farms (221 ha and 1000 ha). The methodology included, for each case study, 20 interviews, two workshops, literature review, expert analysis and the use of indicators of efficacy of adaptation measures, to define tipping points. The adaptation process and the resulting adaptation plans were evaluated by questionnaire and expert review. This combination of methods has supported the choice of effective adaptation measures for the case studies and when combined with several adaptation pathways and a landscape approach it supported the creation of integrated climate change adaptation plans that are now in implementation. We discuss how this combination of methods deals with limitation to Adaptation Pathways identified in the literature, conclude that the method was able to create adaptation plans that are now under implementation and present avenues for future research. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation planning; Agriculture management; Climate adaptation; Farm adaptation; Participatory planning; Scenario Workshop","adaptive management; agri-environmental policy; agricultural management; agroforestry; climate change; decision support system; efficiency measurement; environmental policy; future prospect; literature review; Mediterranean environment; natural resource; resource management; Alentejo; Beja [Portugal]; Mertola; Portugal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101612348

In reference to these situations; this research is aimed at utilizing orange peel oil (OPO) as blend fuel to mineral diesel in light-duty diesel engine and asses the output characteristics for optimizing engine fuel map under idling condition. A four-factor central composite design (CCD) approach-based response surface methodology (RSM) analysis is applied to statistically relate the effect of important input variables on key engine characteristics to achieve minimum emissions without a major compromise on the power output. From the desirability report, for orange Peel Oil (20%) blended with diesel fuel (80%) (OPO20) fuel, the optimum pilot injection timing is 210 before top dead centre (bTDC), pilot mass of 24% and apt fuel injection pressure is 500 bar while maintaining 1100 rpm as idle engine speed. While tuning the OPO20 operated engine fuel map under this optimum operating condition, a notable reduction of 34% in carbon monoxide and 36.84% reduction in smoke is observed in comparison to diesel. However, the increased mean gas temperature in-turn translated into 37.65% increase in oxides of nitrogen. As a trade-off to the reduced emissions, a 15.47% decrease in the brake thermal efficiency is observed while the specific fuel consumption also increased by 29.98% in comparison to diesel operation. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biofuels; Central composite region (CCD); Engine Idling; Low load region; Orange peel oil (OPO); Response surface methodology (RSM)","Carbon monoxide; Citrus fruits; Diesel engines; Economic and social effects; Fossil fuels; Light weight vehicles; Smoke; Traffic congestion; Brake thermal efficiency; Central composite designs; Light-duty diesel engines; Optimum operating conditions; Output characteristics; Pilot injection timing; Response surface methodology; Specific fuel consumption; Biofuels",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100411032

This understanding is complicated by the interplay between responses of seeds to the environment experienced during germination, the environment experienced by the maternal plant during seed development and genetic adaptations of the maternal plant to its environment of origin. Methods: The study species (Anthoxanthum alpinum, A. odoratum) originated from localities with factorial combinations of temperature and precipitation. Seed germination was tested in conditions simulating the extreme ends of the current field conditions and a climate change scenario. We compared the performance of field-collected seeds with that of garden-collected seeds. Results: A change to warmer and wetter conditions resulted in the highest germination of A. alpinum, while A. odoratum germinated the most in colder temperature and with home moisture. The maternal environment did have an impact on plant performance of the study species. Field-collected seeds of A. alpinum tolerated warmer conditions better than those from the experimental garden. Conclusions: The results demonstrate how knowledge of responses to climate change can increase our ability to understand and predict the fate of alpine species. Studies that aim to understand the germination requirements of seeds under future climates should use experimental designs allowing the separation of genetic differentiation, plasticity and maternal effects and their interactions, since all these mechanisms play an important role in driving species’ germination patterns. © 2021 Botanical Society of America","adaptation; alpine species; Anthoxanthum alpinum; climate change; graminoid; maternal effects; phenotypic plasticity; reproductive characteristics; seed dormancy","adaptation; alpine environment; climate change; germination; grass; maternal effect; precipitation (climatology); seed production; temperature effect; Anthoxanthum alpinum; dormancy; germination; maternal inheritance; plant seed; Poaceae; temperature; Germination; Maternal Inheritance; Plant Dormancy; Poaceae; Seeds; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105714133

Light energy is utilized in the generation of excited charge carriers as well as heat. Plasmonic catalysts used these energetic charge carriers (and the heat) to drive chemical reactions on their surface and allowed the discovery of novel and selective reaction pathways that were not possible in thermal catalysis. This review discusses the fundamentals of plasmonic catalysis and its application for CO2 conversion to fuel and chemicals. We first discussed the fundamentals of LSPR and the mechanism of plasmonic photocatalysis, using the concepts of the dielectric function, charge carrier generation, and relaxation pathways. We then reviewed various charge carrier-mediated activation of molecules (their chemical bonds) on the surface of plasmonic nanocatalysts and how the extraction of charge carriers played a critical role in plasmonic catalysis. The concept of multicomponent plasmonic catalysis, a hybrid catalyst by combining plasmonic metals (Cu, Au, Ag, Al, etc.) with nonplasmonic but active catalytic metals (Pt, Pd, Ru, Rh, etc.), in close proximity to each other, was then discussed. Photocatalytic CO2 reduction reactions using the examples of each of three major pathways, (i) direct transfer of hot charge carriers to the reactant molecules, (ii) providing heat to the reactant molecules by photothermal effect, and (iii) enhancing the photon absorption rate of reactant molecules by optical near-field enhancement close to the nanocatalyst surface, were discussed. In the last section, we reviewed plasmonic photocatalysts for dry reforming of methane (DRM) using CO2, which uses two greenhouse gases as feed to produce industrially significant syngas.

Technology is the key for the sustained and precise in-situ spatio-temporal measurements of the physical, biological, biogeochemical, and near-atmospheric meteorological parameters essential for carrying out effective assessments of the status, variability, and change in the ocean ecosystems and for creating policies at the right time. The United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development 2021–2030 provides a timeframe to build a compre-hensive, sustainable, and data-based informed decision-making global ocean observing system. This demands global-scale investigations, trans-disciplinary science, and mechanisms to integrate and distribute data that otherwise would appear to be disparate. The essential ocean variables (EOVs) conceptualized by the Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS) of UNESCO’s Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission guide observation of the ocean. In order to achieve the goal of UN Decade envisaged and to have an Earth System approach under the World Meteorological Organization reforms, it is imperative to address globally and nationally relevant indicators and assessments, which require increased shar-ing of data and analytical methods, sustained long-term and large-scale obser-vations, and resources dedicated to these tasks.

Their redox state and energy conservation highly depend on the availability of a terminal electron acceptor, for example oxygen in aerobic production processes. Under anaerobic conditions in the absence of an electron acceptor, redox balance is achieved via the production of reduced carbon-compounds (fermentation). An alternative strategy to artificially stabilize microbial redox and energy state is the use of anodic electro-fermentation (AEF). This emerging biotechnology empowers respiration under anaerobic conditions using the anode of a bioelectrochemical system as an undepletable terminal electron acceptor. Electrochemical control of redox metabolism and energy conservation via AEF can steer the carbon metabolism towards a product of interest and avoid the need for continuous and cost-inefficient supply of oxygen as well as the production of mixed reduced by-products, as is the case in aerobic production and fermentation processes, respectively. The great challenge for AEF is to establish efficient extracellular electron transfer (EET) from the microbe to the anode and link it to central carbon metabolism to enhance the synthesis of a target product. This article reviews the advantages and challenges of AEF, EET mechanisms, microbial energy gain, and discusses the rational choice of substrate-product couple as well as the choice of microbial catalyst. Besides, it discusses the potential of the industrial model-organism Bacillus subtilis as a promising candidate for AEF, which has not been yet considered for such an application. This prospective review contributes to a better understanding of how industrial microbiology can benefit from AEF and analyses key-factors required to successfully implement AEF processes.

It was attempted to compute the optimal factors using TGRA methodology. It was inferred that laser power diode cutting process can eliminate the striations and dross formation on leather cutting due to elimination of mechanical impact energy. Laser power diode can reduce the carbonization effect on leather cutting owing to the lower and concentrated energy.

From the environmental perspective, the obtained road traffic reduction of 20–50% could be regarded as an undesired traffic regulation experiment. Air quality impacts within Hungary were evaluated based on data from 52 monitoring sites measuring concentrations of pollutants NOx, O3, and PM10. Air pollution during the lockdown was compared to the same period (February–June) in the reference years 2014–2019. The large spatial heterogeneity of the air quality response was explored. The emission reduction coincided with the extreme weather of 2020, characterized by unusually warm pre-lockdown February and spring drought. The anomalously low pre-lockdown air pollution was further reduced (NOx) or increased (PM10) during the restrictions. Compared to the previous years, NOx concentrations during the curfew were found to differ between −4.1 and +0.2 standard deviations (median −1.55 SD), or −45% and +3% (median −18%) among different monitoring locations. Ozone concentrations were unusually high due to both weather and chemical reasons (median +11% or +0.8 SD), while the PM10 response was modest and largely weather-driven (median +7% or +0.4 SD). © 2021 by the authors.

However, there is not enough information about the performance of these structures and substrates for growing edible plants in tropical climate conditions. This study evaluates the best combination of three different modular extensive green roof structures and two types of local substrates (compost and soil + biochar) for Lactuca sativa L. var. crispa (lettuce) growth. Physicochemical and biological properties of substrates and growth variables of plants were measured for the different green roof structures, at the beginning and at the end of the experiment (seven weeks after), and under rainy and dry climatic conditions. According to the model obtained, the monolithic multilayer structure, high concentrations of Mg, elevated amounts of 600 μm aggregates and less substrate bulk density were linked with a higher L. sativa yield. The substrate used, however, was not associated with this result. Additionally, it was found that some of the physicochemical and microbiological properties of substrates changed at the end of the experiment. However, these properties were dependent on climatic conditions. It is recommended to use the monolithic multilayer green roof structure and a substrate with added biochar for higher L. sativa yield. Further evaluations of this structure and substrate for other edible plants may be useful for supporting vulnerable people and enhancing agroecological functions of green roofs in Latin-America. © 2021 The Authors","Biochar; Compost; Microbial functional groups; Physicochemical properties; Urban agriculture","biochar; bulk density; experimental study; leafy vegetable; plant residue; roof; substrate; Latin America; Lactuca; Lactuca sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102627405

Fugitive emissions associated with residual hydrocarbons in tailings ponds pose an environmental concern and include greenhouse gases (GHGs), reduced sulphur compounds (RSCs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Froth treatment tailings (FTT) are a specific type of tailings waste stream from the bitumen froth treatment process that contains bioavailable diluent: either naphtha or paraffins. Tailings ponds that receive FTT are associated with the highest levels of biogenic gas production, as diverse microbial communities biodegrade the residual diluent. In this review, current literature regarding the composition, chemical analysis, and microbial degradation of FTT and its constituents is presented in order to provide a more complete understanding of the complex chemistry and biological processes related to fugitive emissions from tailings ponds receiving FTT. Characterizing the composition and biodegradation of FTT is important from an environmental perspective to better predict emissions from tailings ponds and guide tailings pond management decisions. © 2021 by the authors.

Dicarbonyl stress may already be detrimental in obesity. We evaluated whether diet-induced weight loss can effectively reverse dicarbonyl stress in abdominally obese men. Materials and methods: Plasma samples were collected from lean (n = 25) and abdominally obese men (n = 52) in the fasting state, and during a mixed meal test (MMT). Abdominally obese men were randomized to 8 weeks of dietary weight loss or habitual diet, followed by a second MMT. The α-dicarbonyls methylglyoxal (MGO), glyoxal (GO) and 3-deoxyglucosone (3-DG) and AGEs were measured by UPLC-MS/MS. Skin autofluorescence (SAF) was measured using the AGE reader. T-tests were used for the cross-sectional analysis and ANCOVA to assess the treatment effect. Results: Postprandial glucose, MGO and 3-DG concentrations were higher in obese men as compared to lean men (p < 0.05 for all). Fasting dicarbonyls, AGEs, and SAF were not different between lean and obese men. After the weight loss intervention, fasting MGO levels tended to decrease by 25 nmol/L (95%-CI: -51-0.5; p = 0.054). Postprandial dicarbonyls were decreased after weight loss as compared to the control group: iAUC of MGO decreased by 57% (5280 nmol/L∙min; 95%-CI: 33–10526; p = 0.049), of GO by 66% (11,329 nmol/L∙min; 95%-CI: 495–22162; p = 0.041), and of 3-DG by 45% (20,175 nmol/L∙min; 95%-CI: 5351–35000; p = 0.009). AGEs and SAF did not change significantly after weight loss. Conclusion: Abdominal obesity is characterized by increased postprandial dicarbonyl stress, which can be reduced by a weight loss intervention. Registered under ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier no.

The biogeochemical model PnET-BGC was modified and tested using field observations from an experimentally whole-tree harvested northern hardwood watershed (W5) at the Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest (HBEF), New Hampshire, USA. In this study, the confirmed model was used as a heuristic tool to investigate long-term changes in hydrology, biomass accumulation, and soil solution and stream water chemistry for three different watershed cutting intensities (40%, 60%, 80%) and three rotation lengths (30, 60, 90 years) under both constant (current climate) and changing (MIROC5-RCP4.5) future climate scenarios and atmospheric CO2 through the year 2200. For the no future cutting scenario, total ecosystem stored carbon (i.e., sum of aboveground biomass, woody debris and soil) reached a maximum value of 207 t C ha−1 under constant climate but increased to 452 t C ha−1 under changing climate in 2200 due to a CO2 fertilization effect. Harvesting of trees decreased total ecosystem stored carbon between 7 and 36% for constant climate and 7–60% under changing climate, respectively, with greater reductions for shorter logging rotation lengths and greater watershed cutting intensities. Harvesting under climate change resulted in noticeable losses of soil organic matter (12–56%) coinciding with loss of soil nutrients primarily due to higher rates of soil mineralization associated with increases in temperature, compared with constant climate conditions (3–22%). Cumulative stream leaching of nitrate under climate change (181–513 kg N ha−1) exceeded constant climate values (139–391 kg N ha−1) for the various cutting regimes. Under both climate conditions the model projected greater sensitivity to varying the length of cutting period than cutting intensities. Hypothetical model simulations highlight future challenges in maintaining long-term productivity of managed forests under changing climate due to a potential for a deterioration of soil fertility. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Harvesting; Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest; Managed forests; MIROC5-RCP4.5; PnET-BGC","Atmospheric chemistry; Biogeochemistry; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Climate models; Deterioration; Ecosystems; Forestry; Harvesting; Soil moisture; Watersheds; Above ground biomass; Biogeochemical modeling; Biomass accumulation; Future climate scenarios; Hubbard Brook experimental forest; Soil organic matters; Streamwater chemistry; Sustainable forest management; Climate change; carbon dioxide; soil organic matter; carbon dioxide; climate change; ecosystem service; fertilizer application; forest dynamics; forest management; harvesting; sustainability; sustainable forestry; Article; biogeochemical model; biomass; biomass accumulation; carbon footprint; carbon storage; chemistry; climate change; controlled study; field study; forest management; harvesting; heuristics; hydrology; logging; model; New Hampshire; northern hardwood watershed; productivity; simulation; soil analysis; soil fertility; soil fertilization; stream (river); sustainable agriculture; water chemistry; watershed; wood debris; New Hampshire; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100373832

However, the particular characteristics of the molecule always made it a chemical with low, if any, benefit once compared to conventional fossil fuels. Still, the current need to decarbonize our economy makes the search of new methods crucial to use chemicals, such as ammonia, that can be produced and employed without incurring in the emission of carbon oxides. Therefore, current efforts in this field are leading scientists, industries, and governments to seriously invest efforts in the development of holistic solutions capable of making ammonia a viable fuel for the transition toward a clean future. On that basis, this review has approached the subject gathering inputs from scientists actively working on the topic. The review starts from the importance of ammonia as an energy vector, moving through all of the steps in the production, distribution, utilization, safety, legal considerations, and economic aspects of the use of such a molecule to support the future energy mix. Fundamentals of combustion and practical cases for the recovery of energy of ammonia are also addressed, thus providing a complete view of what potentially could become a vector of crucial importance to the mitigation of carbon emissions. Different from other works, this review seeks to provide a holistic perspective of ammonia as a chemical that presents benefits and constraints for storing energy from sustainable sources. State-of-the-art knowledge provided by academics actively engaged with the topic at various fronts also enables a clear vision of the progress in each of the branches of ammonia as an energy carrier. Further, the fundamental boundaries of the use of the molecule are expanded to real technical issues for all potential technologies capable of using it for energy purposes, legal barriers that will be faced to achieve its deployment, safety and environmental considerations that impose a critical aspect for acceptance and wellbeing, and economic implications for the use of ammonia across all aspects approached for the production and implementation of this chemical as a fueling source. Herein, this work sets the principles, research, practicalities, and future views of a transition toward a future where ammonia will be a major energy player. © 2021 The Authors.

These changes, coupled with extreme rainfalls and inadequate flood channelling infrastructure, lead to urban flooding. The urban transport sector is at constant risk from urban flooding, and it should adapt to these climate change effects. This study focuses on developing an indicator-based approach called composite adaptability index (CAI) to assess the urban transportation system's adaptability to urban flooding based on exposure, susceptibility, and resilience. The weights of the indicators are estimated using Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), and the consistency tests are conducted to assess the efficiency of the weights.

However, focussing grassland management on one of these characteristics might negatively affect the other. Here, we describe for the first time the amount of C stored in the plant and soil compartments of extensively grazed highland grasslands of central Argentina. We quantified C stocks of standing plant, litter, and roots biomass, and soil (0–100 cm depth) in three coexisting grassland types associated with different livestock use: lawns and open and closed tussock grasslands (from higher to lower grazing use) and analysed how those stocks vary across grassland types. Our main results showed that these mountain grasslands represent an important regional C reservoir, with total C stocks (plant plus soil) ranging from 110 to 472 Mg C ha−1, with more than 95% of C being stored in soils. Differences in soil C stocks up to 30 cm depth were not associated with grassland types. However, in grazing lawns (higher livestock use), belowground plant C increased, whereas aboveground plant C was reduced. Overall, resulting in a 14% lower C stored in the plant-soil system up to 30 cm depth than in tussock grasslands. Our study shows that highland grasslands of central Argentina maintain huge soil C reservoirs. However, livestock use could reduce surface C stocks by affecting the plant biomass compartments, which could have a long-term effect on soil C stocks. These findings have direct implications for mountain grasslands management and conservation in the context of climate change mitigation. © 2020 Ecological Society of Australia","livestock grazing; mountain pastures; plant biomass allocation; soil carbon stocks; soil depth","biomass; carbon cycle; carbon storage; grazing; livestock; soil carbon; soil chemistry; tussock grassland; upland region; Argentina; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098054488

Isoprene is both deposited and formed in soil, where it can be consumed by some soil microbes, although much remains to be understood about isoprene consumption in tropical soils. In this study, isoprene‐degrading bacteria from soils associated with tropical plants were investigated by cultivation and cultivation‐independent approaches. Soil samples were taken from beneath selected framework forest trees and economic crops at different sea-sons, and isoprene degradation in soil microcosms was measured after 96 h of incubation. Isoprene losses were 4–31% and 15–52% in soils subjected to a lower (7.2 × 105 ppbv) and a higher (7.2 × 106 ppbv) concentration of isoprene, respectively. Sequencing of 16S rRNA genes revealed that bacterial communities in soil varied significantly across plant categories (framework trees versus economic crops) and the presence of isoprene, but not with isoprene concentration or season. Eight isoprene-degrading bacterial strains were isolated from the soils and, among these, four belong to the genera Ochrobactrum, Friedmanniella, Isoptericola and Cellulosimicrobium, which have not been previously shown to degrade isoprene. © 2021 by the authors.

In particular, we expect species to experience major changes in competition as they track favorable climates. Here, we combine experimental data with a recently developed theoretical framework based on coexistence theory to measure the impact of climate-driven range shifts on alpine plant persistence under climate change. We transplanted three co-dominant alpine perennial species to five elevations, creating a maximum of 5°C increase in average growing-season temperature. We statistically modeled species' demographic rates in response to the environment and interpolated species' intrinsic ranges—the environmental mapping of reproduction in the absence of competition. We used low-density population growth rates—species' initial rate of invasion into an established community—as a metric of persistence. Further analysis of low-density growth rates (LGRs) allowed us to parse the direct impacts of climate change from indirect impacts mediated by shifting competition. Our models predict qualitatively different range shifts for each species based on the climate conditions under which growth rates are maximized and where they are zero. Overall, climate change is predicted to increase the intrinsic (competition free) growth rates of all species, as warmer and wetter conditions increase the favorability of alpine habitat. However, these benefits are entirely negated by increased competition arising from greater overlap between competitors in their intrinsic ranges. Species were highly dispersal limited, which can prevent species from tracking shifting intrinsic ranges by reducing population spread rates. Yet dispersal limitation also promoted species' persistence because it promotes persistence mechanisms. Our study demonstrates the complex pathways by which climate change impacts species' persistence by altering their competitive environment, and highlights how a persistence framework based on LGRs can help disentangle impacts. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","alpine plants; climate change; coexistence theory; community ecology; range shifts","climate change; climate effect; coexistence; community ecology; competition (ecology); perennial plant; plant community; climate change; ecosystem; plant; temperature; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Plants; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101524317

By creating an inventory, we gathered detailed information collected up to October 2020 of scientific literature, research projects, press releases, information on business initiatives and public policies regulations on ES and conservation of marine biodiversity in the N2RB (Cíes Islands and Island of Ons, including the Ons–O Grove Complex). Better protection of marine natural capital needs coordinated efforts among all sectors of government, business, and international institutions.

This in sacco decomposition study investigates (1) the potential of the granulated biogas residue fraction to provide nutrients and enhance soil carbon sequestration when utilized as exogenous organic matter in grassland soils, and (2) the impact of different nitrogen fertilizers on the organic matter decomposition and nutrient release processes. The experiment was conducted in two permanent grasslands of the Greater Region over one management period using rooibos tea as a comparator material. The decomposition and chemical changes of the two materials after incubation in the soil were assessed by measuring the mass loss, total carbon and nitrogen status, and fibre composition in cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Overall, after the incubation period, granulated biogas residue maintained up to 68% of its total mass, organic matter and total carbon; increased its content in recalcitrant organic matter by up to 45% and released 45% of its total nitrogen. Granulated biogas residue demonstrated resilience and a higher response uniformity when exposed to different nitrogen fertilizers, as opposed to the comparator material of rooibos tea. However, the magnitude of fertilizer-type effect varied, with ammonium nitrate and the combinatorial treatment of raw biogas residue mixed with urea leading to the highest organic matter loss from the bags.

Oil and gas production rates from these wells fluctuate due to changes in demand, and is expected to decline over the coming decades to centuries due to the transition to renewable energy. The CH4 emissions profile from wells that are 'shut-in' to accommodate changes in demand has not been previously measured, and thus it is unclear whether reduced demand will actually result in reduced CH4 emissions from oil and gas production. Here we present the results of a measurement campaign of CH4 emissions from shut-in and other non-producing oil wells in the Permian Basin, Texas, the largest oil production basin on Earth. All the wells we measured were conventionally drilled oil wells, and we did not measure CH4 emissions from any shut-in unconventional wells. We found that, of 37 wells measured, two-thirds had an emission rate of less than 1 g CH4 hr-1, with the remaining seven wells ranging from 1.3 to 132.0 g CH4 hr-1. The average CH4 emission rate from all wells was 6.2 g CH4 hr-1, lower than previous measurements of CH4 emissions from active conventional wells in the Permian Basin (∼400 g CH4 hr-1) (Robertson et al (2020 Environ. Sci. Technol. 54 13926-34)). Some shut-in wells could be a substantial source of CH4 emissions if this category is not subject to leak detection and repair regulations. We also found five orphaned wells that were a source of produced water to the surface, sometimes in very large quantities (1000s of liters per minute), with evidence for emissions of CH4, hydrogen sulfide, brine, and possibly other hazardous chemicals such as oil residue. Future work should further characterize the impacts of shut-in and orphaned wells on greenhouse gas emissions, water quality and human health. © 2021 The Author(s).

In addition, aircraft measurements from 2011 Deriving Information on Surface Conditions from Column and Vertically Resolved Observations Relevant to Air Quality are used to evaluate how emissions, chemical mechanism, and measurement uncertainty each contribute to the overall model performance. We show distinct seasonal and time-of-day patterns in NOX performance. Summertime NOX is overpredicted with bimodal peaks in bias during early morning and evening hours and persisting overnight. The summertime morning NOX bias dropped from between 28% and 57% for earlier years (2002-2012) to between -2% and 7% for later years (2013-2016). Summer daytime NOX tends to be unbiased or underpredicted. In winter, the evening NOX overpredictions remain, but NOX is unbiased or underpredicted overnight, in the morning, and during the day. NOX overpredictions are most pronounced in the Midwestern and Southern United States with Western regions having more of a tendency toward model underpredictions of NOX. Modeled NOX performance has improved substantially over time, reflecting updates to the emission inputs and the CMAQ air quality model. Model performance improvements are largest for years simulated with CMAQv5.1 or later and for emission inventory years 2014 and later, coinciding with reduced onroad NOX emissions from vehicles with newer emission control technologies and improved treatment of chemistry, deposition, and vertical mixing in CMAQ. Our findings suggest that emissions temporalization of specific mobile source sectors have a small impact on model performance, while chemistry updates improve predictions of NOY but do not improve summertime NOX bias in the Baltimore/DC area. Sensitivity runs performed for different locations across the country suggest that the improvement in summer NOX performance can be attributed to updates in vertical mixing incorporated in CMAQv5.1.

Generation sources can use coal, fuel oil, gas, local and alternative energy sources as fuel and energy resources. This causes additional emissions of pollutants. Prediction of negative impact on the environment depends on the quantity and quality of emissions during the operation of various types of installations that generate electric and thermal energy. The purpose of the study is to select and substantiate the most attractive method for predicting the impact on the environment of generating sources in agricultural production. The widespread introduction of distributed energy using local and renewable energy sources will significantly reduce emissions of pollutants due to a decrease in energy intensity, matching the required load with the capacity of generation sources, using the most energy efficient sources, and widespread introduction of renewable energy sources. In this regard, it is advisable to forecast the impacts by the scenario method considering the implementation of the proposed distributed power supply system. The implementation of measures developed considering the analysis of the forecast of the negative impact on the environment of generating plants in agricultural enterprises will reduce the negative impact on the environment by introducing energy-efficient technologies into the energy balance of the enterprise, as well as increase production by up to 20% and increase sustainability. rural areas. © 2021 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,"Agricultural engineering; Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Coal deposits; Ecosystems; Electric power systems; Energy efficiency; Energy policy; Environmental technology; Forecasting; Pollution; Renewable energy resources; Rural areas; Sustainable development; Agricultural enterprise; Agricultural productions; Alternative energy source; Distributed power supply system; Energy efficient technology; Impact on the environment; Renewable energy source; Rural electrification; Coal industry",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107118836

A multichannel supply chain model is constructed in this work under the flat carbon tax policy and progressive carbon tax policy. The complexity of the supply chain under the channel heterogeneity expectations is studied. The impacts of consumers' dual preferences and the free-riding of each channel on the system complexity, profits, carbon emissions and social welfare are explored. This study indicates that the supply chain order quantity system under the two types of carbon tax policies will enter into an unstable state with changes in consumers' preferences and free-riding parameters. In order to positively impact on the profits of all parties, government revenue, consumer surplus, and the environment, the system should be kept in stable region. Consumers' preferences and free-riding have more obvious influence on the social welfare under the progressive emission carbon tax policy than the flat carbon tax policy. In contrast to the flat carbon tax policy, the progressive carbon tax policy can delay or even prevent the order quantity system from entering into the bifurcation and chaos area, and the chaos control effect under the progressive carbon tax policy is better. The present work expands the practical application scenarios of complex system theory and thereby has an important theoretical and practical value. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","chaos control; complexity; flat carbon tax policy; Multichannel supply chain; progressive carbon tax policy","Chaos theory; Emission control; Profitability; Supply chains; Taxation; Application scenario; Bifurcation and chaos; Comparative studies; Complexity and control; Consumers' preferences; Progressive emissions; Supply chain modeling; System complexity; Economic analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106968252

In the first experiment, it was a complete randomized design with 6 treatments and 3 replications. The treatments were 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 % of CFO in the total substrate (DM basis) by using a glass syringe system and Para grass (Brachiara mutica) used as the main substrate. In the second experiment, it was a 4x4 Latin square design with 4 growing crossbred cattle (Red Sindhi x local cattle) and 4 treatments. The treatments were the supplementation of CFO at a level of 0, 1, 2 and 3% corresponding to the CFO0, CFO1, CFO2 and CFO3 treatments. In all the treatments rice straw was fed ad libitum, while concentrate feed was fed at a level of 1 kg per 150 kg LW. The results showed that the in vitro CH4 and CO2 production from 0-48 h were significantly different (P&lt;0.05) among the treatments and they were gradually abated (P&lt;0.05) when increasing CFO levels from 0 to 5%. In Exp 2 the nutrient intakes and digestion of cattle supplemented with different levels of catfish oil were not significantly different (P&gt;0.05) among the treatments and rumen parameters and nitrogen retention of cattle were similar (P&gt;0.05) in different treatments, however, the rumen NNH3 and VFAs concentrations were higher at 3 h after feeding as compared to those before feeding. The CH4 production (L/kg DMI) had a trend of gradual reduction from CFO0, CFO1, CFO2 and CFO3 treatments, however this (L/kg DDM) gradually decreased among the treatments (P&lt;0.05) with the values of 51.3, 50.1, 49.8 and 46.1, respectively, and the linear relationship between the CH4 emissions and CFO supplementation being y= 51.7-1.59x (R2=0.836). It was concluded that a consistent reduction of CH4 production (L/kg DDM) and no adverse effect on nutrient digestibility and rumen environment was found when increasing the CFO from 0 to 3% in the in vitro and in vivo experiments of the crossbred cattle. © 2021 Fundacion CIPAV.

In this study, we evaluated changes in soil, plant and rhizobacteriome community structure parameters across seasons (wet and dry) in two edaphic savannas (SV-1 and SV-5) using four dominant plant species. We then examined relationships between rhizobacteriome community structure and soil properties, plant biomass, and conventional and novel root traits. We further hypothesized that plants adapted to the Aripo Savanna had a core rhizobacteriome, which was specific to plant species and related to root foraging traits. Our results showed that cation exchange capacity (CEC) and the concentration of micronutrients (Fe, Cu and B) were the only soil factors that differed across savanna and season, respectively. Plant biomass traits were generally higher in the dry season, with a higher allocation to root growth in SV-5. Root traits were more plastic in SV-5, and network length-distribution was the only root trait which showed a consistent pattern of lower values in the dry season for three of the dominant plant species. Rhizobacterial community compositions were dominated by Proteobacteria and Acidobacteria, as well as WPS-2, which is dominant in extreme environments. We identified a shared core rhizobacteriome across plant species and savannas. Cation exchange capacity was a major driver of rhizobacterial community assemblies across savannas. Savanna-specific drivers of rhizobacterial community assemblies included CEC and Fe for SV-1, and CEC, TDS, NH4+, NO3−, Mn, K, and network length-distribution for SV-5. Plant factors on the microbiome were minimal, and host selectivity was mediated by the seasonal changes. We conclude that edaphoclimatic factors (soil and season) are the key determinants influencing rhizobacteriome community structure in multiple stressed-environments, which are ecologically similar to the Aripo Savanna. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bacteriome; Biomass; Climatic changes; Core-microbiome; Rhizosphere; Root traits","Biomass; Climate change; Drought; Positive ions; Cation exchange capacities; Community assembly; Community composition; Community structures; Dominant plant species; Extreme environment; Length distributions; Natural variation; Soils; boron; copper; iron; abiotic factor; acclimation; biomass; cation exchange capacity; climate change; community structure; environmental stress; rhizobacterium; root; savanna; seasonal variation; soil improvement; Acidobacteria; Article; biomass; cation exchange; climate change; community structure; environmental stress; evolutionary adaptation; foraging; nonhuman; plant; plant root; plasticity; priority journal; Proteobacteria; rhizosphere bacterium; root growth; savanna; seasonal variation; soil property; ecosystem; grassland; plant; soil; Trinidad and Tobago; Trinidad [Trinidad and Tobago]; Acidobacteria; Proteobacteria; Biomass; Ecosystem; Grassland; Plants; Soil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099709821

However, no defined medium exists for T. hugenholtzii JAD2T and no single carbon source is known to support its growth, leaving key knowledge gaps in its metabolism and nutritional needs. Here, we report comparative genomic analysis of the draft genome of T. hugenholtzii JAD2T and eight closely related metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) from geothermal sites in China, Japan, and the United States, representing “Candidatus Thermoflexus japonica,” “Candidatus Thermoflexus tengchongensis,” and “Candidatus Thermoflexus sinensis.” Genomics was integrated with targeted exometabolomics and 13C metabolic probing of T. hugenholtzii. The Thermoflexus genomes each code for complete central carbon metabolic pathways and an unusually high abundance and diversity of peptidases, particularly Metallo- and Serine peptidase families, along with ABC transporters for peptides and some amino acids. The T. hugenholtzii JAD2T exometabolome provided evidence of extracellular proteolytic activity based on the accumulation of free amino acids. However, several neutral and polar amino acids appear not to be utilized, based on their accumulation in the medium and the lack of annotated transporters. Adenine and adenosine were scavenged, and thymine and nicotinic acid were released, suggesting interdependency with other organisms in situ. Metabolic probing of T. hugenholtzii JAD2T using 13C-labeled compounds provided evidence of oxidation of glucose, pyruvate, cysteine, and citrate, and functioning glycolytic, tricarboxylic acid (TCA), and oxidative pentose-phosphate pathways (PPPs). However, differential use of position-specific 13C-labeled compounds showed that glycolysis and the TCA cycle were uncoupled. Thus, despite the high abundance of Thermoflexus in sediments of some geothermal systems, they appear to be highly focused on chemoorganotrophy, particularly protein degradation, and may interact extensively with other microorganisms in situ. © Copyright © 2021 Thomas, Payne, Tamadonfar, Seymour, Jiao, Murugapiran, Lai, Lau, Bowen, Silva, Louie, Huntemann, Clum, Spunde, Pillay, Palaniappan, Varghese, Mikhailova, Chen, Stamatis, Reddy, O’Malley, Daum, Shapiro, Ivanova, Kyrpides, Woyke, Eloe-Fadrosh, Hamilton, Dijkstra, Dodsworth, Northen, Li and Hedlund.","Chloroflexi; exometabolomics; genomics; metagenome-assembled genomes; Thermoflexus; Thermoflexus hugenholtzii; thermophile","ABC transporter; ABC-type glycerol 3-phosphate transporter; acetic acid; adenine; adenosine; alanine; amino acid transporter; ammonia; arabinogalactan; aspartic acid; carbamate kinase; carbon; carotenoid; citrulline; cysteine; cytochrome c oxidase; fructose; fumaric acid; glycine; homocysteine; hydroxyproline; isoleucine; leucine; lysine; menaquinone; nicotinic acid; nitrous oxide reductase; octopine; peptidase; phenylalanine; phosphoenolpyruvate; polyvinylidene fluoride; proline; pyruvic acid; riboflavin; RNA 16S; serine proteinase; spermidine; succinic acid; threonine; thymine; tyrosine; valine; Article; bacterial growth; bacterial metabolism; bacterium culture; CandidatusThermoflexus japonica; CandidatusThermoflexus sinensis; CandidatusThermoflexus tengchongensis; carbohydrate metabolism; carbon metabolism; carbon source; Chloroflexi; citric acid cycle; controlled study; cyanobacterium; denitrification; DNA extraction; enzyme specificity; Escherichia coli; gene sequence; genome size; genomics; glucose metabolism; glucose oxidation; glycolysis; high performance liquid chromatography; liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry; metabolomics; metagenome; metagenomics; microbial community; microbial diversity; nonhuman; pentose phosphate cycle; photosynthesis; phylogeny; protein degradation; radiolabeling; Thermoflexus hugenholtzii; thermophile; whole genome sequencing",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106066387

Functional responses and their role in determining thermal plasticity of plants remain poorly understood. Our objective was to compare trait responses of six populations of Ludwigia peploides resulting from seed from Oceanic climate and from Mediterranean climate after an exposure at three temperatures (16, 24, and 30°C). A comparative analysis showed that at 30°C, the six populations of L. peploides shared different morphological responses, whereas a common pattern of morphological responses was found for the six populations at 16°C. At 16°C, the growth was very low suggesting a stress. At 30°C, the three Mediterranean populations of L. peploides accumulated ≈ sevenfold more total biomass than the populations from Oceanic region. Despite drawing similar response pattern to temperature, the populations showed several different metabolic responses. The thermal plastic responses to the highest temperature differed according to the origin of the populations. The Mediterranean populations of L. peploides could be better adapted to rising temperature. These abilities could allow them to take advantage from climate warming if the temperature is not warming up to temperature above a critical threshold. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate warming; Ludwigia peploides; Metabolome approach; Morphological traits; Physiological traits","aquatic plant; climate change; comparative study; invasive species; Mediterranean environment; morphology; phenotypic plasticity; temperature effect; warming; Ludwigia peploides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85094845065

The structures are irradiated in the presence of a solution containing diazonium salts at wavelengths that match the resonance positions at 532 nm, 632.8 nm, and 800 nm. The resulting grafting shows polarization and wavelength-dependent growth patterns at the nanoscale. The plasmon-mediated reactions over arrays of the crosshair structures are further investigated using scanning electron microscopy and supported by finite domain time domain modelling revealing wavelength and polarization specific reactions.

The synthesized NCs exhibited a porous network-like structure with a high surface area of CF/rGO (158.22 m2/g), which was 2.24 folds higher than that of CF. The Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) and Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) analysis for CF/rGO/Carbon cloth (Cc) revealed a high reduction current density of −7.3 A/m2 and a low charge transfer resistance of 2.8 Ω. The isobutyrate and acetate in MES-2 (Cu/rGO/Cc) were produced at 35.37 g/m2/d, which was 1.53 folds higher than that of MES-1 (bare Cc: 23.10 g/m2/d). The columbic efficiency (77.78%) and total VFA concentration (1941.13 ± 83 mg COD/L) were noted to be 1.97 and 1.6 folds higher for MES-2 than MES-1, respectively. The Tafel plot drawn from the CV curves exhibited an exchange current density value of MES-2 that was 3.46 A/m2, and this value was 1.19 and 33.92 folds higher than that of MES-1 and abiotic CF/rGO/Cc, respectively. Field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) observations revealed enhanced rod-shaped bacteria had grown on the cathode suggesting excellent biocompatible and multi-length scale porosity of CF/rGO catalysts for enhanced colonization of microbes. The phyla Proteobacteria (Betaproteobacteria), Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were highly abundant as the dominant microbial communities on the cathode, which might played a major role in bioelectrochemical CO2 reduction to VFAs. The results from this study clearly demonstrate that the CF/rGO/Cc electrode could serve as a conductive element between microbes and bactericidal electrodes with excellent electrochemical properties to enable performance of the MES. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Acetate; Bio-combustion method; Copper ferrite; Isobutyrate; Microbial electro reduction; Reduced graphene oxide","Bacteria; Biocompatibility; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Charge transfer; Copper alloys; Copper compounds; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrochemical electrodes; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Ferrite; Field emission cathodes; Field emission displays; Field emission microscopes; Graphene; Magnetic materials; Reduction; Scanning electron microscopy; Charge transfer resistance; Conductive elements; Exchange current densities; Field emission scanning electron microscopy; Microbial communities; Microbial reduction; Rod-shaped bacteria; Volatile fatty acids (VFAs); Volatile fatty acids; acetic acid; carbon dioxide; copper; copper ferrite; graphene oxide; isobutyric acid; nanocomposite; unclassified drug; volatile fatty acid; ferric ion; ferrite; graphene oxide; graphite; volatile fatty acid; acetate; combustion; copper; electrode; fatty acid; graphite; microbial community; nanocomposite; reduction; absorption; Article; Bacteroidetes; Betaproteobacteria; biocompatibility; catalyst; combustion; controlled study; current density; cyclic voltammetry; electrochemistry; field emission scanning electron microscopy; Firmicutes; impedance spectroscopy; microbial electrosynthesis; nonhuman; porosity; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); surface area; electrode; Bacteroidetes; Betaproteobacteria; Firmicutes; Proteobacteria; Carbon Dioxide; Copper; Electrodes; Fatty Acids, Volatile; Ferric Compounds; Graphite",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099508914

Nevertheless, conventional diesel is still the predominant fuel for heavy-duty trucks. Road freight transport consumes 25% of the world’s energy and is responsible for emissions with local health impacts and the global greenhouse effect. In this context, this paper reviewed items from 2015 to 2020 to analyze the technologies available for the road freight transport regarding pollutant and GHG emissions. Results are presented in two parts: first quantitatively, quantitative data was extracted from reviewed papers and statistically treated and, second, qualitatively through a comparative chart, which shows the impact on air pollutants from the use of a different type of fuels. In general, papers are mostly concerned with particulate matter (PM), carbon monoxide (CO), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and hydrocarbons (HC) emissions due to its impact on public health, with a low number of papers covering GHG emissions. The trade-off between different fuels and how this process can impact emissions, sometimes increasing or decreasing specific pollutants, is discussed. According to the analyzed papers, the main characteristics that affect the pollutant emissions are, in general, the fuel oxygen content and the combustion chamber temperature. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Air pollution; Alternative fuel; Emissions; Heavy-duty vehicles; Internal combustion engines; Transport sector","alternative fuel; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; freight transport; greenhouse gas; hydrocarbon; literature review; particulate matter; sustainability; traffic emission; gasoline; air pollutant; air pollution; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Gasoline; Motor Vehicles; Particulate Matter; Vehicle Emissions",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102256230

When flocculation is used for algae removal, algal carbon is often turned into CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2). Here, we established a “bio-pump” to control algal blooms and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by the introduction of submerged macrophytes to the aquatic ecosystem and combination of flocculation and capping. The results suggested that this strategy contributed to an approximately 98% algae removal and sustainably improved dissolved oxygen (DO) in the water and sediment after the 40-day incubation. The aerobic condition at the sediment-water interface and deeper oxygen penetration in the sediment inhibited the abundance of microorganisms related to anaerobic CH4 production, then changed the metabolic pathway and fate of algal carbon. After the 40-day incubation, compared with flocculation-capping treatments, the bio-pump reduced 69.07% CH4 and 77.57% CO2 emissions, which was jointly contributed by the inhibition of anaerobic CH4 production, aerobic oxidation of CH4 and carbon sequestration of submerged macrophytes. This was also demonstrated from the finding of a decrease in methyl coenzyme M reductase (mcrA) gene, an increase in particulate methane monooxygenase (pmoA) gene and the absorption of 13C-labeled from algae biomass by submerged macrophytes at the end of incubation. Therefore, the bio-pump established in the present study can improve DO in algal blooms water and turn algal-derived organic matter into the plant biomass, which supplied a sustainable method for algae removal and GHG reduction. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Algae removal; Bio-pump; Carbon sequestration; GHG reduction; Sustainable DO improvement","Algae; Aquatic ecosystems; Biochemical oxygen demand; Carbon dioxide; Chemicals removal (water treatment); Dissolved oxygen; Flocculation; Gas emissions; Genes; Methane; Ostwald ripening; Phase interfaces; Sediments; Algal-derived organic matter; Carbon sequestration; Greenhouse gas production; Metabolic pathways; Methyl-coenzyme M reductase; Particulate methane monooxygenase (pMOA); Sediment water interface; Submerged macrophytes; Greenhouse gases; carbon 13; carbon dioxide; coenzyme M reductase; dissolved oxygen; fresh water; methane; methane monooxygenase; organic matter; oxidoreductase; oxygen; water; carbon dioxide; methane; absorption; algal bloom; aquatic ecosystem; biological pump; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; dissolved oxygen; gas production; gene expression; greenhouse gas; methane; oxic conditions; absorption; algal bloom; algal genetics; Anaerolinaceae; aquatic biology; aquatic environment; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; chemical composition; Chlorella pyrenoidosa; Clostridiaceae; comparative study; controlled study; Firmicutes; flocculation; fungal biomass; greenhouse gas; macrophyte; metabolism; methanogen; methanotroph; microbial biomass; microbial community; mineralization; nonhuman; oxidation; Peptostreptococcaceae; phytoplankton; real time polymerase chain reaction; Rhodocyclaceae; sediment; Spongiibacteraceae; stable isotope labeling; water quality; water temperature; ecosystem; eutrophication; Carbon Dioxide; Ecosystem; Eutrophication; Greenhouse Gases; Methane",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85093677021

Riparian planting (RP) of urban watershed can enhance the degradation of pollutants, while fixing the carbon and nitrogen in plant biomass. Although a few previous publications have demonstrated the potential benefits of stormwater treatment by RP, the critical plant-specific indexes and corresponding contributions to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, in both the senses of water purification and carbon fixation, have never been elucidated quantitatively. This study investigated a total of 21 plant species to their capacities reducing both carbonaceous pollutants and ammonia in synthetic stormwater during a 30-day period and under different operational conditions. Water quality data were collected to analyze the half-life (t1/2) of pollutants degradation rates of each plant species. Carbon contents in the stem, leaf, and root of each species were measured and used to calculate the total carbon sequestration potential per planting area. Colocasia tonoimo (CT) and Thalia dealbata in freshwater; Crinum asiaticum and Phragmites australis in brackish water; and Kandelia obovate and Aegiceras corniculatum in seawater showed shortest average t1/2 for the degradation of all three pollutants. Negative linear relationships were found between the t1/2 of ammonia and the increased biomass in leaves and shoot. The highest carbon sequestration densities calculated using plant CT in the batch and continuous flow systems were 231.1 and 313.9 g/m2, respectively. Nitrogen sequestration densities of CT in batch and continuous flow conditions were 16.7 and 22.6 g/m2, respectively, which were also the highest among all the tested plant species. Current GHG emission of the targeted watershed without planting (Tsui Ping River, Hong Kong) were 0.151 kg CO2-e/m3-water treated. When CT were planted in the simulated watershed at the maximum areas the GHG emission can be reduced to lower than 0.082 kg CO2-e/m3. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Greenhouse gas emission; Riparian planting; Stormwater treatment; Water-energy nexus; Watershed management","Air purification; Ammonia; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Degradation; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen; Plants (botany); Sewage; Storms; Water quality; Water treatment; Watersheds; Carbon sequestration; Continuous-flow system; Degradation of pollutants; Nitrogen sequestration; Operational conditions; Phragmites australis; Stormwater treatment; Watershed restoration; Water pollution",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101352401

An illustrative network and the Sioux Falls network are used to test the proposed framework and to examine how traffic dynamics, population characteristics, and meteorological conditions affect emission exposure at various network locations. The results provide evidence that regional emission exposure can be reduced by dynamically managing network traffic. At least under the specific network setup, the paper provides a counterexample to the common conception that traffic congestion and emissions (exposure) can be minimized simultaneously, which implies that traffic system operators must properly leverage the tradeoff between congestion and emissions. © 2021","Dynamic system optimum; Dynamic traffic flow model; Emission dispersion; Gaussian plume model; Human exposure to vehicular emissions","Atmospheric movements; Dispersions; Dynamical systems; Thermal plumes; Dynamic framework; Dynamic system optimums; Dynamic traffic; Dynamic traffic flow model; Emission dispersion; Gaussian plume models; Human exposure to vehicular emission; Human exposures; Traffic networks; Vehicular emission; Traffic congestion; carbon emission; Gaussian method; health risk; pollution exposure; trade-off; traffic congestion; traffic emission",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103948339

Generally, in cold climates, it is best to avoid wind to better control the thermal environment. However, crafted passive airflow is essential for providing fresh air and natural ventilation at certain times of year. The use of a window of the right size and location in a cold climate is also indispensable. In this study, the wind speed was calculated for the height of a residential building in the city of Tabriz. A computational fluid dynamics simulation was used to calculate the inflow air speed for each window and the comfort conditions were compared. The findings determined the months where window openings can be used to enhance thermal comfort. The analysis shows how the direction and shape of the window play a major role in directing outdoor air flow indoors at the right time in the right quantity. East- and west-facing windows are most favorable and north- and south-facing windows can only be used in some months. This shows how building designers can quantify the effect of window design in each climate for the occupant's comfort. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

This report describes the process of producing Cleveland Clinic UltraPure Solution (CCUPS), quality and safety monitoring, economic costs, and clinical outcomes. Study Design: Retrospective study. Setting & Participants: CVVHD experience at Cleveland Clinic, focusing on dialysate production, institutional factors, and patients requiring continuous kidney replacement therapy. Production is shown at www.youtube.com/watch?v=WGQgephMEwA. Outcomes: Feasibility, safety, and cost. Results: Of 6,426 patients treated between 2011 and 2019 with continuous kidney replacement therapy, 59% were men, 71% were White, 40% had diabetes mellitus, and 74% presented with acute kidney injury. 98% of patients were treated with CVVHD using CCUPS, while the remaining 2% were treated with either continuous venovenous hemofiltration or continuous venovenous hemodiafiltration using commercial solution. The prescribed and delivered effluent doses were 24.8 (IQR) versus 20.7 mL/kg/h (IQR), respectively. CCUPS was as effective in restoring electrolyte and serum bicarbonate levels and reducing phosphate, creatinine, and serum urea nitrogen levels as compared with packaged commercial solution over a 3-day period following initiation of dialysis, with a comparable effluent dose. Among those with acute kidney injury, mortality was similar to that predicted with the 60-day acute kidney injury predicted mortality score (r = 0.997; CI: 0.989-0.999). At our institution, the cost of production for 1 L of CCUPS is $0.67, which is considerably less than the cost of commercially purchased fluid. Limitations: Observational design without a rigorous control group. Conclusions: CVVHD using locally generated dialysate is safe and cost-effective. © 2021 The Authors","acute renal failure; AKI; continuous veno-venous hemodialysis; CRRT; CVVHD; end stage kidney disease; hemodialysis; homemade dialysate; machine generated bicarbonate; ultrapure","adult; Article; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; continuous hemodialysis; female; human; major clinical study; male; middle aged; observational study; patient safety; retrospective study; therapy effect",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104957835

This transport system, known as a Cooperative Intelligent Transport System (C-ITS), is aimed to enhance the safety of road users, driving comfort as well as to reduce the CO2 emissions. Industry and academic communities all-over the world is continuously performing research and implementing field measurements to bring C-ITS technology to life. Both 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) and European Telecommunication Standards Institute (ETSI) have been working on respective standards (3GPP V2X and ETSI ITS G5 in Europe) to provide seamless connections in C-ITS communications. In this poster paper, we discuss the pilot C-ITS use-case scenarios conducted on a test-track in Northern Finland. The pilot measurements are planned by using heterogeneous wireless communication technologies (ITS-G5 and 5GTN) to provide C-ITS service alerts. The C-ITS service alerts are used to avoid road traffic collisions as well as to improve traffic efficiency with CO2 reduction. The C-ITS pilot service alerts proved that the heterogeneous network considerably improves the communication link availability between vehicles and road-side-infrastructure to make it more secure, eco-friendly and efficient. © 2021 IEEE.","5GTN; C-ITS; ITS-G5; RWS; VANET","Carbon dioxide; Cooperative communication; Heterogeneous networks; Intelligent systems; Mobile telecommunication systems; Roads and streets; Traffic control; 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP); European telecommunication standards institutes; Intelligent transport systems; Pervasive technologies; Road traffic collisions; Wireless communication technology; Wireless communications; Wireless technologies; Intelligent vehicle highway systems",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113282215

Here, we report evidence of fluid mixing between basinal brines and oil during deposition of coarse sphalerite at a classic carbonate-hosted Pb-Zn district, Pine Point, Northwest Territories, Canada. The brines contain high concentrations of Pb, detectable aqueous sulfate, and hydrocarbons that attest to chemical interaction with oil. The oil inclusions in sphalerite contain much less Pb relative to the brines and no evident H2S, suggesting that the principal role of hydrocarbons was as a reductant. Mixing of brine with oil enabled the conversion of aqueous sulfate to sulfide, and thereby triggered sphalerite deposition. © 2020 Geological Society of America.

We show that the breeding success of seabirds is tracking hemispheric differences in ocean warming and human impacts, with the strongest effects on fish-eating, surface-foraging species in the north. Hemispheric asymmetry suggests the need for ocean management at hemispheric scales. For the north, tactical, climate-based recovery plans for forage fish resources are needed to recover seabird breeding productivity. In the south, lower-magnitude change in seabird productivity presents opportunities for strategic management approaches such as large marine protected areas to sustain food webs and maintain predator productivity.

We analyzed data from a national probability survey of 1222 US adults who reported believing in climate change at least “somewhat” to estimate public support for Soil Carbon Storage and how it compares to other leading Carbon Dioxide Removal (CDR) strategies. Overall, a majority of the sample expressed support for Soil Carbon Storage—regardless of whether the strategy involved the use of biochar (a form of charcoal made from organic matter) or not (55% and 62%, respectively)—placing Soil Carbon Storage ahead of Bioenergy plus Carbon Capture and Storage (32%) and Direct Air Capture (25%), and behind only Afforestation and Reforestation (73%), in terms of public support. In addition, perceiving Soil Carbon Storage as “natural” strongly predicted individual-level support, a pattern that held for every CDR strategy featured on the survey.

The effectiveness of using NO3– in souring control depends on the partial reduction of NO3– to nitrite (NO2–) and/or N2O while in MEOR complete reduction of NO3– to N2 is desired. Thauera has been reported as a dominant taxon in such applications, but the impact of NO3– and NO2– concentrations, and pH on the kinetics of denitrification by this bacterium is not known. With the goal of better understanding the effects of such parameters on applications such as souring and MEOR, three strains of Thauera (K172, NS1 and TK001) were used to study denitrification kinetics when using acetate as an electron donor. At low initial NO3– concentrations (∼1 mmol L–1) and at pH 7.5, complete NO3– reduction by all strains was indicated by non-detectable NO3– concentrations and near-complete recovery (&gt; 97%) of the initial NO3-N as N2 after 14 days of incubation. The relative rate of denitrification by NS1 was low, 0.071 mmol L–1 d–1, compared to that of K172 (0.431 mmol L–1 d–1) and TK001 (0.429 mmol L–1 d–1). Transient accumulation of up to 0.74 mmol L–1 NO2– was observed in cultures of NS1 only. Increased initial NO3– concentrations resulted in the accumulation of elevated concentrations of NO2– and N2O, particularly in incubations with K172 and NS1. Strain TK001 had the most extensive NO3– reduction under high initial NO3– concentrations, but still had only ∼78% of the initial NO3-N recovered as N2 after 90 days of incubation. As denitrification proceeded, increased pH substantially reduced denitrification rates when values exceeded ∼ 9. The rate and extent of NO3– reduction were also affected by NO2– accumulation, particularly in incubations with K172, where up to more than a 2-fold rate decrease was observed. The decrease in rate was associated with decreased transcript abundances of denitrification genes (nirS and nosZ) required to produce enzymes for reduction of NO2– and N2O. Conversely, high pH also contributed to the delayed expression of these gene transcripts rather than their abundances in strains NS1 and TK001. Increased NO2– concentrations, N2O levels and high pH appeared to cause higher stress on NS1 than on K172 and TK001 for N2 production. Collectively, these results indicate that increased pH can alter the kinetics of denitrification by Thauera strains used in this study, suggesting that liming could be a way to achieve partial denitrification to promote NO2– and N2O production (e.g., for souring control) while pH buffering would be desirable for achieving complete denitrification to N2 (e.g., for gas-mediated MEOR). © Copyright © 2021 Suri, Zhang, Gieg and Ryan.","denitrification; denitrification gene transcripts; MEOR; NO2– accumulation; NO3– concentration; pH; souring; Thauera","acetic acid; nitrate; nitrite; nitrogen dioxide; nitrous oxide; nitrous oxide reductase; RNA 16S; anaerobic digestion; aquatic environment; Article; bacterial growth; bacterium culture; bacterium isolate; biodegradation; bioremediation; chemical oxygen demand; corrosion; denitrification; fermentation; freshwater environment; gas chromatography; gene expression; gene sequence; genetic transcription; heat stress; high performance liquid chromatography; limit of detection; metabolite; methanogenesis; microbial community; nonhuman; nucleotide sequence; pH; photosynthesis; physiological stress; remission; stoichiometry; temperature; Thauera; wastewater",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106048336

Here, molybdenum nitride (Mo2N) was demonstrated as an efficient photoassisted catalyst for SRCC at low temperature (175 °C; 1.0 W·cm-2 UV-vis light; CO yield rate, 0.35 mmol·g-1·h-1). The CO yield rate was 26.7 times higher than that in the absence of light illumination. The greatly improved yield was ascribed to the formation of highly active species Mo2NHx via the photoinduced H2 heterolysis. Besides, the photoinduced broken-symmetry of atomic electron densities in Mo-N pairs might strengthen the local electric fields and thus caused H2 heterolysis to form Mo2NHx active species at low temperature. Moreover, the appearance of Mo2NHx could lower the activation barriers, leading to an improved CO yield. Furthermore, the reversible transformation between Mo2N and Mo2NHx endowed Mo2N with high durability for SRCC. © 2021 American Chemical Society.",,"Chemical shift; Electric fields; Molybdenum compounds; Solar energy; Temperature; Water gas shift; Activation barriers; Atomic electron density; Catalytic materials; Light illumination; Local electric field; Reverse water-gas shift reaction; Reversible transformation; Selective reduction; Selective catalytic reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106476405

It is an urgent problem to find out the long-term climate change rules of this region. Using 101 tree core samples obtained from 54 trees, a 343-year tree-ring width chronology of the Platycladus orientalis (L.) Franco (1673–2016) in the Wula Mountains, Inner Mongolia, China was established. The analysis shows that the radial growth of P. orientalis is closely related to hydrothermal conditions, the average minimum temperature and relative humidity are the main factors that determine the growth of P. orientalis. Based on the strong correlation between the tree-ring indices and the annual average minimum temperature (r = −0.870, p < 0.001), we reconstructed an average annual minimum temperature series from 1673 to 2016 using a linear regression equation, and the reconstructed equation can explain 75.724% of the variance, respectively. According to the data from the past 343 years, the changes in the annual average minimum temperature series had the cycles of 58.6-, 7.7-, 3.4-, 3.1-, 2.2-, and 2.1-years; the series showed three warm periods (1824–1830, 1909–1922, and 1986–2011) and 4 cold periods (1703–1712, 1731–1738, 1754–1763, and 1937–1951). The low temperature periods recorded in the reconstructed series for the 17th and 18th centuries are consistent with the Little Ice Age that occurred in the northern hemisphere, and the heating rate significantly increased at the end of the 20th century. In addition, the cold and warm periods recorded by the reconstruction result is basically consistent with the extreme climate events recorded in the historical documents of the region and the reconstruction results in other regions. In this paper, the world's first chronology of P. orientalis tree ring width was established. A historical sequence of annual average minimum temperature of 343 years was reconstructed in a typical region of the East Asian monsoon climate. It fills in the blank of reconstruction sequence and variation characteristics of mean minimum temperature in the northern edge of East Asian monsoon and transition zone of temperate continental and monsoon climate in recent four centuries. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA","Climate change; Climate reconstruction; Dendroclimatology; Platycladus orientalis (L.) franco","climate variation; coniferous tree; dendrochronology; extreme event; Holocene; paleoclimate; paleotemperature; regression analysis; relative humidity; China; Nei Monggol; Wula Shan; Platycladus orientalis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098856021

Here, we perform electronic structure analysis and localized orbital bonding analysis to probe the redox chemistry of its Cu and μ-oxo sites. Also, the X-ray absorption near-edge structure, XANES, of methane activation in [Cu3O3]2+ is compared to that of the more ubiquitous [Cu2O]2+. Methane C-H activation is associated with only the Cu2+/Cu+ redox couple in [Cu2O]2+. For [Cu3O3]2+, there is no basis for the Cu3+/Cu2+ couple's participation at the density functional theory ground state. In [Cu3O3]2+, there are many possible intrazeolite intermediates for methane activation. In the nine possibilities that we examined, methane activation is driven by a combination of the Cu2+/Cu+ and oxyl/O2- redox couples. Based on this, the Cu 1s-edge XANES spectra of [Cu2O]2+ and [Cu3O3]2+ should both have energy signatures of Cu2+ → Cu+ reduction during methane activation. This is indeed what we obtained from the calculated XANES spectra. [Cu2O]2+ and [Cu3O3]2+ intermediates with one Cu+ site are shifted by 0.9-1.7 eV, while those with two Cu+ sites are shifted by 3.0-4.2 eV. These are near a range of 2.5-3.2 eV observed experimentally after contacting methane with activated copper-exchanged zeolites. Thus, activation of methane by [Cu3O3]2+ will lead to formation of Cu+ sites. Importantly, for future quantitative XANES studies, involvement of O- + e- → O2- in [Cu3O3]2+ implies a disconnect between the overall reactivity and the number of electrons used in the Cu2+/Cu+ redox couple. ©",,"Chemical activation; Chemical bonds; Computation theory; Computational chemistry; Copper; Copper metallography; Copper oxides; Density functional theory; Electronic structure; Ground state; Methane; Oxide minerals; X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy; Zeolites; Computational analysis; Copper-exchanged zeolite; Energy signatures; Localized orbitals; Methane activation; Methanol conversion; Number of electrons; X ray absorption near edge structure; Activation analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103771404

Historical sea level records indicate that relative sea level (RSL) has been increasing along the Danish North Sea coast, south of Skagerrak, following the global mean sea level (GMSL) rise. In the central Skagerrak-Kattegat Seas, RSL rise has been practically absent, due to the GMSL rise being off-set by the Fennoscandian post-glacial land-uplift. The new IPCC Special Report on the Ocean and Cryosphere in a Changing Climate (SROCC) reported that under RCP8.5 GMSL will increase more than the previous estimates in the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) at the end of twenty-first century due to Antarctic ice sheet dynamics. We performed a regionalization of the SROCC sea level projections for the “Danish Climate Atlas” dataset, a nation-wide climate adaptation dataset based on IPCC and various national and international databases. In these complementary datasets, important local data have been considered, which have not been included in the IPCC SROCC GMSL rise estimates, i.e., more precise national-wide land-rise prediction and sets of sea level fingerprints. Our results indicate that sea level projections under RCP8.5 results in a > 40 cm RSL rise at the end of the twenty-first century in the Skagerrak-Kattegat Seas, which might call for a new adaptation strategy in this region. The rate of mean sea level rise will exceed the rate of the land-rise earlier than the previous estimates by AR5 under the RCP8.5 scenario. In particular, we stress how these new estimates will affect future extreme sea levels in this region. Based on our results, we suggest this more recent GMSL projection needs to be considered in coastal risk assessments in the Skagerrak-Kattegat Seas also in this century. © Copyright © 2021 Su, Andrée, Nielsen, Olsen and Madsen.","Baltic Sea; Denmark; IPCC SROCC; North Sea; sea level rise; storm surge",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107058247

One significant question to answer is to find out the locations of all the clean non-fossil fuel heat sources that could be used for district heating within the city's administrative boundary, and to evaluate how much heat could be extracted from these heat sources. This paper maps out both the geolocations and the technical potentials of the clean non-fossil fuel heat sources for densely populated Stockholm City region, using Geographical Information System based integrative-analysis method. The mapping achieves 1-meter high-resolution and provides integrated open datasets to overcome the data availability issue. The mapping results show that a great number of clean and non-fossil fuel heat sources are available for district heating in Stockholm City. By fully unlocking the potentials of these heat sources, around 7054 GWh heat energy is estimated to be possibly exploited per year, which could cover 100% of the existing district heating energy requirement in Stockholm City. The potential share of each mapped heat source is: water bodies 48.3%, data centers 45.4%, supermarkets 4.5%, underground subway stations 0.8%, sewage plants 0.5%, shallow geothermal 0.3% and ice rinks 0.2%. A total of 9 heat sources clusters are identified, which could be prioritized for clean heating energy exploitation. By using the high-resolution mapping, the district heating utilities could plan the capacity in a forward looking way according to the local heat source availability. The method pipeline developed in this study could be recommended to other cities with district heating needs and assist their clean district heating transition roadmap design. © 2021 The Author(s)","District heating; Geographical Information System (GIS); Heat source; High-resolution","Fossil fuels; Groundwater; Information systems; Information use; Mapping; Sewage; Subway stations; Decarbonising; Geographical information system; Heat sources; Heating energy; Heating sectors; High resolution; High-resolution mapping; Non-fossil fuels; Stockholm; Zero emission; Geographic information systems",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102389567

Promising strategies include the conversion of waste biomass to hydrogen, methane, liquid fuels, or electricity coupled with CO2 capture and storage (CCS). A key challenge for these projects is the need to connect geographically dispersed biomass supplies with geologic storage sites by either transporting biomass or CO2. We assess the cost of transport for biomass conversion projects with CCS using publicly available cost data for trucking, rail, and CO2 pipelines in the United States. We find that for large projects (order of 1 Mt/yr CO2 or greater), CO2 by pipeline is the lowest cost option. However, for projects that send most of the biomass carbon to storage, such as gasification to hydrogen or electricity production, biomass by rail is a competitive option. For smaller projects and lower fractions of carbon sent to storage, such as for pyrolysis to liquid fuels, CO2 by rail is the lowest cost option. Assessing three plausible example projects in the United States, we estimate that total transport costs range from $24/t-CO2 stored for a gasification to hydrogen project traversing 670 km to $36/t for a gasification to renewable natural gas project traversing 530 km. In general, if developers have flexibility in choosing transport mode and project type, biomass sources and storage sites can be connected across hundreds of kilometers for transport costs in the range of $20-40/t-CO2 stored. Truck and rail are often viable modes when pipelines cannot be constructed. Distances of 1,000 km or more can be connected in the same cost range when shared CO2 pipelines are employed. © Copyright © 2021 Stolaroff, Pang, Li, Kirkendall, Goldstein, Aines and Baker.","BECCS; biofuels; carbon dioxide removal (CDR); CCS; CO2 transport; hydrogen; negative emissions","Bioconversion; Biomass; Carbon; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Gasification; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Liquid fuels; Liquid methane; Natural gasoline plants; Pipelines; Trucks; Biomass conversion; Biomass source; Carbon removal; Electricity production; Geologic storage; Global climates; Transport costs; Transport modes; Cost benefit analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107191996

For N = 4, we observe a protective effect of hydrogenation against the loss of native hydrogens, in the form of an increase in the appearance energies of the and C16H8+ daughter ions compared to those reported for pristine pyrene (C16H10). No such effect is seen for N = 6 or 16, where the weakening effect of replacing aromatic bonds with aliphatic ones outweighs the buffering effect of the additional hydrogen atoms. The onset of fragmentation occurs at similar internal energies for N = 4 and 6, but is significantly lower for N = 16. In all three cases, H-loss and C m H n -loss (m ≥ 1, carbon backbone fragmentation) channels open at approximately the same energy. The branching fractions of the primary channels favor H-loss for N = 4, C m H n -loss for N = 16, and are roughly equal for the intermediate N = 6. We conclude that superhydrogenated pyrene is probably too small to support catalytic H2-formation, while trends in the current and previously reported data suggest that larger PAHs may serve as catalysts up to a certain level of hydrogenation. © 2021.

However, the decision related to where central heating is most viable is dependent on many different aspects, like heating densities or current heating structures. An urban energy simulation platform based on 3D building objects can improve the accuracy of energy demand calculation on building level, but lacks a system perspective. Energy system models help to find economically optimal solutions for entire energy systems, including the optimal amount of centrally supplied heat, but do not usually provide information on building level. Coupling both methods through a novel heating grid disaggregation algorithm, we propose a framework that does three things simultaneously: optimize energy systems that can comprise all demand sectors as well as sector coupling, assess the role of centralized heating in such optimized energy systems, and determine the layouts of supplying district heating grids with a spatial resolution on the street level. The algorithm is tested on two case studies; one, an urban city quarter, and the other, a rural town. In the urban city quarter, district heating is economically feasible in all scenarios. Using heat pumps in addition to CHPs increases the optimal amount of centrally supplied heat. In the rural quarter, central heat pumps guarantee the feasibility of district heating, while standalone CHPs are more expensive than decentral heating technologies. © 2021 by the authors.

However, compared with single building retrofitting, there are no established approaches for energy retrofitting at district and urban scales, in part due to the complexity of the computational problem and the decision-making process. In the transition towards low-carbon cities, new approaches to assess a variety of energy efficiency and renewable energy generation solutions for large building stocks at acceptable computational costs are needed. Moreover, stakeholders require flexible and adaptable tools to support the selection of the most cost-effective retrofitting scenario. In this context, this study proposes a new methodology for the planning of energy retrofitting at urban scale. By extending the system boundary from single buildings to a whole district, local energy potentials and innovative measures can be identified. Furthermore, an integrative approach involving a large variety of energy conservation and renewable energy generation measures, evaluated at different scales and levels of detail is proposed. Finally, a simple but flexible tool to aid the decision-making process has been developed. The tool chooses the best performing measures out of a variety of alternatives, prioritizes them in order of their cost-efficiency, and generates a retrofitting roadmap for the district depending on the desired goal or capital of the project. The results can be adapted to changing parameters such as energy prices or CO2-emissions, ensuring the flexibility and adaptability of the decision-making process throughout the implementation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Decision-making; District retrofitting; Energy retrofits; Urban energy planning","Cost effectiveness; Economic and social effects; Energy efficiency; Renewable energy resources; Retrofitting; Zoning; Built environment; Decision-making process; Decisions makings; District retrofitting; Energy; Energy retrofit; Integrate renewable energies; Renewable energy generation; Urban energy planning; Urban scale; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102395118

Changes in terrestrial freshwater discharge entering the Arctic Basin from pan-Arctic watersheds significantly impact oceanic circulation and sea ice dynamics. Historical streamflow records in high-latitude basins are often discontinuous (seasonal or with large temporal gaps) or sparse (poor spatial coverage), however, making trends from observed records difficult to quantify. Our objectives were to generate a more continuous 90-year record (1981-2070) of spatially distributed freshwater flux for the Arctic Basin (all Arctic draining rivers, including the Yukon), suitable for forcing ocean models, and to analyze the changing simulated trends in freshwater discharge across the domain. We established these data as valid during the historical period (1971-2015) and then used projected futures (preserving uncertainty by running a coupled climate-hydrologic ensemble) to analyze long-term (2021-2070) trends for major Arctic draining rivers. When compared to historic trends reported in the literature, we find that trends are projected to nearly double by 2070, with river discharge to the Arctic Basin increasing by 22% (on average) by 2070. We also find a significant trend toward earlier onset of spring freshet and a general flattening of the average annual hydrograph, with a trend toward decreasing seasonality of Arctic freshwater discharge with climate change and regulation combined. The coupled climate-hydrologic ensemble was then used to force an ocean circulation model to simulate freshwater content and thermohaline circulation. This research provides the marine research community with a daily time series of historic and projected freshwater discharge suitable for forcing sea ice and ocean models. Although important, this work is only a first step in mapping the impacts of climate change on the pan-Arctic region. © 2021 The Author(s).

Over the past few years, EIS has revealed many significant findings in hybrid halide perovskite (HHP)-based optoelectronic devices too. Photoinduced ion-migration, negative capacitance, anomalous mid-frequency capacitance, hysteresis, and instability to heat, light and moisture in HHP-based devices are among the few issues addressed by the IS technique. However, performing EIS in perovskite devices presents new challenges related to multilayer solid-state device geometry and complicated material properties. The ions in the perovskite behave in a specified manner, which is dictated by the energy-levels of the transport layer. Electronic-ionic coupling is one of the major challenges to understand ion transport kinetics in solid-state devices. In this work, we have performed impedance measurements in both solid-state (S-S) and liquid-electrolyte (L-E) device geometry to unfold the effect of charge transport layers on the ac ionic conductivity in perovskite materials. We have modelled the impedance spectra using the electrical equivalent circuit (EEC) and compared the behaviour of ions in different controlling environments. It was concluded that the AC as well as dc ionic conductivity and the accumulation of ions in the perovskite material are highly influenced by the nature of the interface in different device geometry. Charge accumulation in the S-S device gives rise to large polarisation, thereby negative capacitance or any inductive loop can be observed in the Nyquist plot while in the L-E device the presence of an electric double layer at the perovskite/electrolyte interface reduces the surface polarisation effect. Ionic conductivity is hopping limited in the low field regime and diffusion limited in the high field regime in the S-S device. Moreover, the perovskite/electrolyte based devices are promising candidates for electrolyte gated field-effect transistors, perovskite-based supercapacitors and electrochemical cells for water splitting or CO2 reduction. © 2021 the Owner Societies.",,"Capacitance; Electric field effects; Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy; Electrolytes; Equivalent circuits; Field effect transistors; Geometry; Interface states; Ionic conductivity; Ions; Optoelectronic devices; Perovskite; Phase interfaces; Polarization; Charge accumulation; DC ionic conductivity; Electric double layer; Electrical equivalent circuit; Halide perovskites; Impedance measurement; Liquid electrolytes; Negative capacitance; Ionic conduction in solids",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106543586

However, the ore formation process (syngenetic vs. epigenetic) is still a subject of controversy. In this paper we focus on key characteristics of the HYC deposit that remain unexplained: Preservation of sedimentary carbonate (dolomite) and its association with Zn, and the role of thallium (Tl) and manganese (Mn) distribution in the orebody. Our findings demonstrate a sequence of events during ore formation: Tl is hosted almost exclusively within euhedral pyritic overgrowths around early diagenetic pyrite; sphalerite mineralization occurred after Tl-bearing pyrite overgrowths, in association with acid dissolution (replacement) of laminated and nodular dolomite across the subbasin; and outer rims are enriched in Mn on preserved dolomite at the dissolution reaction front in contact with sphalerite. New thermodynamic fluid chemistry modeling demonstrates the metal distribution and paragenesis can be explained by acidic, oxidized ore fluids entering the pyrite-dolomite host lithology, allowing reduction and pH buffering by acid carbonate dissolution, resulting in stepwise metal deposition in an evolving fluid. We argue this represents strong evidence for epigenetic ore formation at HYC. Furthermore, the primary control on ore deposition is not synsedimentary faulting in the subbasin; rather, the chemical potential of sedimentary carbonate within reduced, sulfidic lithologies appears to be of critical importance to precipitation of sphalerite. © 2021 Gold Open Access.",,"Association reactions; Carbonation; Deposits; Dissolution; Lead zinc deposits; Lithology; Mineralogy; Precipitation (chemical); Pyrites; Sedimentology; Silver deposits; Textures; Zinc sulfide; Acid dissolution; Dissolution reactions; Key characteristics; Metal deposition; Metal distributions; Northern Australia; Ore formation process; Sequence of events; Ore reduction; carbonate; fluvial deposit; Proterozoic; replacement; Australia; McArthur River; Northern Territory",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105065749

What are the varying economic, governance, and energy and climate sustainability aspects associated with the diffusion of smart meters for electricity? What lessons can be learned from the ongoing rollouts of smart meters around the world? Based on an original dataset twice as comprehensive as the current state of the art, this study examines smart meter deployment across 41 national programs and 61 subnational programs that collectively target 1.49 billion installations involving 47 countries. In addition to rates of adoption and the relative influence of factors such as technology costs, we examine adoption requirements, modes of information provision, patterns of incumbency and management, behavioral changes and energy savings, emissions reductions, policies, and links to other low-carbon transitions such as energy efficiency or renewable energy. We identify numerous weak spots in the literature, notably the lack of harmonized datasets as well as inconsistent scope and quality within national cost-benefit analyses of smart meter programs. Most smart meters have a lifetime of only 20 years, leading to future challenges concerning repair, care, and waste. National-scale programs (notably China) account for a far larger number of installations than subnational ones, and national scale programs also install smart meters more affordably, i.e. with lower general costs. Finally, the transformative effect of smart meters may be oversold, and we find that smart electricity meters are a technology that is complementary, rather than disruptive or transformative, one that largely does not challenge the dominant practices and roles of electricity suppliers, firms, or network operators. © 2021 The Author(s)","Energy and innovation; Energy transitions; Smart grids; Smart meters","electricity; energy efficiency; global change; governance approach; household energy; innovation; smart grid; sustainability; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104907342

In combination with the post-Euro 6 requirements for criteria pollutants, the exhaust system is expected to be more complex to allow for extremely low emissions under all driving conditions, potentially involving technologies such as electrical heating and phase-change materials. The longer ‘zero-flow’ operation of the exhaust system in hybrid applications and the associated light-out risk have demanding accuracy requirements for heat loss calculations and require additional thermal management strategies. This paper discusses the additional challenges posed with regard to catalyst modeling in the boundary conditions of electrified vehicles and the necessary improvements that go beyond the state-of-the-art techniques. Most of the necessary improvements are linked to advanced 3D modeling of the exhaust system components accounting for free convection and radiative heat transfer. Modeling of electrically assisted heating is demonstrated using a new approach involving a combined 3D electrical–thermal solver. Heat retention technologies with use of phase-change materials are also accounted for in these new-generation models. Finally, the need for a tighter integration of these high-fidelity models into a vehicle simulation framework is discussed. © 2021 by the authors.

Plastic film mulching (PM) cultivation is considered a promising technique for improving economic benefits and reducing greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI). However, the effects of the different cultivation practices differences on the GHGI and the net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) remain unclear. A three-year experiment was performed to measure CH4 and N2O emissions and grain yields, and then comprehensively assess the GHGI and NEEB. Four rice cropping treatments were established in a traditional single rice field: continuously flooded (CF), rainfed (RF), PM, and PM with ratoon rice cultivation (PM + RR). Compared with CF, RF increased N2O emissions by 108% and reduced CH4 emissions and grain yield by 75% and 22%, respectively, resulting in a reduction of NEEB by 1396 CNY ha−1 y−1. Switching from CF to PM, however, decreased annual CH4 emissions by 56% and increased N2O emissions by 358%, resulting in a 51% reduction in GHGI and an 883% increase in NEEB. Under PM, RR further reduced GHGI by 12% and increased NEEB by 18%. Compared with CF, PM + RR not only significantly increased crop yield by 1.32 t ha−1 and NEEB by 4410 CNY ha−1 y−1, but also dramatically decreased GHGI by 57%. These findings indicate that planting ratoon rice under PM can improve NEEB and reduce GHGI, potentially leading to a win-win situation for the environment and growers in water-stressed regions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Global warming potential; Methane; Net ecosystem economic budget; Nitrous oxide; Plastic film mulching; Ratoon rice","Budget control; Crops; Ecosystems; Global warming; Grain (agricultural product); Greenhouse gases; Methane; Plastic films; CH$-4$; Emission yields; Global warming potential; Grain yield; Greenhouses gas; N$-2$/O; Net ecosystem economic budget; Nitrous oxide; Plastic film mulching; Ratoon rice; Nitrogen oxides",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102636892

In this study, we quantified the impact of air pollution and noise pollution on the NV potential at both city scale and building scale in London. At city scale, the loss of annual cooling energy saving potential due to noise pollution (8.1 kWh/m2) was found to be comparable to that due to air pollution (9.0 kWh/m2). At building scale, we selected a naturally ventilated office building in central London with two windows facing a noisy and polluted traffic road and one window overlooking a quiet and clean courtyard for case study. By coupling EnergyPlus simulation with advanced wind tunnel experiments, we identified the prevailing inflow directions and cooling energy saving potentials of 26 NV modes with different window combinations. It was found that cross ventilation with stack effects is the most efficient NV mode for indoor-outdoor exchanges and prevailing building inflow direction can be regulated by optimising window openings at different heights. Particularly for the case study building, we can save cooling energy by up to 5.6 kWh/m2 per month in the optimal NV mode while minimising the negative health impact of ambient pollution by introducing more fresh air from the cleaner side. In addition, local urban morphological changes such as the presence of a tall building or the expansion of an adjacent road were also found to be influential on NV performances. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy saving; Healthy buildings; Indoor-outdoor exchanges; Natural ventilation; Optimized window opening strategies","Air cleaners; Air pollution; Cooling; Noise pollution; Office buildings; Roads and streets; Tall buildings; Ventilation; Wind tunnels; Ambient pollution; Building energy efficiency; Cross ventilation; Different heights; Morphological changes; Natural ventilation; Sustainable solution; Wind tunnel experiment; Energy efficiency; airflow; architectural design; computer simulation; energy efficiency; indoor air; numerical model; ventilation; wind field; wind velocity; England; London [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101516467

However, potentially varying biotic sensitivity is a major source of uncertainty for translating environmental changes to extinction risks. To reduce this uncertainty, we assessed how extinction risks will be affected by future human-driven environmental changes, focusing on 554 species from 52 disjunct plant genera between eastern Asia (EAS) and eastern North America (ENA) to control for differences in environmental sensitivity at the genus level. Species distribution models were used to estimate and compare the vulnerability of species in disjunct genera between the two regions under two climate and land cover change scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5) in the 2070s, allowing to assess the effects of differences in climate and land cover pressures. Compared with ENA, stronger pressures from climate and land cover changes along with smaller range sizes in EAS translate into a larger number and proportion of species in disjunct genera becoming threatened by the 2070s. These regional differences are more pronounced under a best-case climate scenario (RCP2.6), illustrating that strong climate change (RCP8.5) may override any regional buffer capacities. The main variables determining extinction risks differed between the two continental regions, with annual temperature range and cropland expansion being important in EAS, and annual precipitation being important in ENA. These results suggest that disparities in regional exposure to anthropogenic environmental changes may cause congeneric species with relatively similar sensitivity to have different future risks of extinction. Moreover, the findings highlight the context-specific nature of anthropogenic effects on biodiversity and the importance of making region-specific policies for conservation and restoration in response to the intensifying global changes. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","climate change; disjunct genera; extinction risk; land cover change; range shifts; species distribution modeling","biodiversity; climate change; disjunct distribution; extinction risk; land cover; species diversity; species richness; Far East; North America; biodiversity; climate change; ecosystem; Far East; human; North America; plant; Biodiversity; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Far East; Humans; North America; Plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101442389

Plant resulted in a change of earth surface albedo and the hydrological cycle, as well as increased rock weatherability thereby causing a persistent change in atmospheric CO2 and O2. Land plants are, however, themselves dependent on O2 for respiration and long-term survival, something not considered in current geochemical models. In this perspective, we highlight two aspects of land plants’ dependency on O2 relevant for the geobiological community: (a) fossil root systems can be used as a proxy for minimum levels of past atmospheric O2 consistent with a given fossil root depth; and (b) by identifying a positive feedback mechanism involving atmospheric O2, root intensity, terrestrial primary production and organic carbon burial. As an example, we consider archaeopterid fossil root systems, resembling those of modern mature conifers. Our soil–plant model suggest that atmospheric O2 with 1 SD probably reached pressures of 18.2 ± 1.9 kPa and 16.8 ± 2.1 kPa by the Middle and Late Devonian, respectively, that is 86 ± 9% and 79 ± 10% of the present-day 21.2 kPa. © 2021 The Authors.

Setting Mortality and level of PM 2.5 data from the United Nations, Global Burden of Disease and University of Chicago were used. Outcome measures Age pattern of mortality and the number of life-years lost (LYL) attributable to PM 2.5 in years 2000-2015. LYL were further separated into causes of death to quantify the contribution of each cause. Results Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) mortality increased to represent over 31% of the LYL attributable to PM 2.5 between 2005-2010 and 2010-2015 in Asia (females 31% and males 35%). However, great diversity in LYL attributable to PM 2.5 by causes-of-death were found across the region, with IHD proportions of LYL ranging from 25% to 63% for males from Eastern and Central Asia, respectively. Similar diversity was observed for mortality attributable to PM 2.5 for other causes of death across Asia: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (LYL ranging from 6% to 28%), lung cancer (4% to 20%) and stroke (11% to 22%). Conclusion PM 2.5 is a crucial component in the rising health effects in Asia. The diverse trends in cause-specific mortality attributable to PM 2.5 creates a further challenge for health systems in the region. These findings highlight that immediate interventions are needed to mitigate the increasing levels of air pollution and with that reduce its detrimental effect on the health and mortality of Asian populations. © 2021 BioMed Central Ltd..

Thirty-two metasedimentary rock samples were collected along a N-S gradient locally affected by contact metamorphism before and after the main regional tectono-metamorphic event (DP1). First-order spectra document a decreasing peak area ratio R2 and an increasing temperature TCM towards the south and the surrounding granitoids. Domains with intermediate (535–600 °C) TCM values match the extent of the pre-DP1 contact aureole but also image a so far unclear post-DP1 aureole. The axial part of the belt, likely unaffected by granite intrusions, preserves southward increasing TCM from 425 to 660 °C. Second-order spectra show a single S1 band that splits into two peaks (S1- and S1+) whose frequency difference ΔS1 increases stepwise towards the south. The spatial distribution of ΔS1 follows that of the E–W trending regional metamorphic zones. The splitting of S1 indicates a transition from two-dimensional to three-dimensional CM and occurs at ~500 °C, which seems to be common to all metamorphic belts worldwide. Despite regional metamorphism CM was able to record the post-DP1 contact overprint and there is no clear observation of delayed CM recrystallization, which likely depends on the crystallinity of the CM precursor. A discrepancy between first- and second-order Raman parameters suggests that they partly record the influence of different factors; R2 gives an account of thermal events, particularly those related to localized contact metamorphism, whereas ΔS1 potentially yields information on regional variations in heating duration and pressure. This demonstrates the potential of the full Raman spectrum of CM for deciphering the complex thermal history of orogenic systems. © 2021 The Author(s)","Carbonaceous material; Metamorphic gradient; Raman spectroscopy; Ryoke belt","aureole; granitoid; igneous intrusion; metamorphism; metasedimentary rock; Raman spectroscopy; recrystallization; spatial distribution; Honshu; Japan; Ryoke Belt",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101340188

We conducted in-depth document analyses and semi-structured interviews with government officials, city staff, and community members involved with the resolution process. We used time series and thematic analyses to determine causal events and identify fundamental themes within the data. The data that emerged from the interviews and document analyses were then cross compared to the social-ecological transformations framework and community coalition building theory to inform and organize our findings of how renewable electricity resolutions were developed and adopted in these communities. Our findings deliver a transferable five-step framework: 1) using trigger events for inspiration; 2) envisioning change; 3) identifying challenges and potential solutions; 4) building support; 5) taking it to a vote.

We show that the electronic contribution to the emission exhibits a dependence on the emission frequency which is very similar to the energy dependence of the nonequilibrium distribution, and characterize different scenarios determining the measurable emission line shape. This enables the identification of experimentally relevant situations, where the emission lineshapes deviate significantly from predictions based on the standard theory (namely, on the photonic density of states), and enables the differentiation between cases where the emission scales with the metal object surface or with its volume. We also provide an analytic description (which is absent from the literature) of the (polynomial) dependence of the metal emission on the electric field, its dependence on the pump laser frequency, and its nontrivial exponential dependence on the electron temperature, both for the Stokes and anti-Stokes regimes. Our results imply that the emission does not originate from either Fermion statistics (due to e-e interactions), and even though one could have expected the emission to follow boson statistics due to involvement of photons (as in Planck's Black Body emission), it turns out that it deviates from that form as well.

We consider these targets by using the climate change policy version of the GTAP-E model of the world economy to analyse economic and environmental outcomes in the transition from domestic settings to broad international linkages for selected major emitting regions. We have obtained several insights. First, developing nations present relatively low emission abatement costs compared to developed countries. China and India are also major emitters with substantial possibilities to create carbon credits for selling to other regions. Second, any forms of international carbon markets are confirmed to have lower costs for a linked global system than domestic-solely schemes. Third, the participation of China and India in an international carbon market particularly drives down the carbon price (to US$1.62 per tonne of CO2-e) and economic costs of the system. Real GDP of countries in such a linkage will only decline by 0.1%, while the electricity sector in most countries only experiences 1% loss in their output levels. The US, European Union and Australia particularly benefit from the participation of China and India in the carbon linkage by significantly lowering costs on their economies. Finally, it is also found that not all international emission linkages benefit low abatement cost countries if they do not have suitable strategies to recycle their net carbon trading revenues. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","China; Emission abatement cost; GTAP-E; India; Nationally Determined Contributions; Paris Agreement","Carbon; Climate change; Climate models; Economics; Emission control; Forestry; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Abatement costs; Climate change policies; Developed countries; Developing nations; Electricity sector; Environmental outcome; Impact evaluation; International linkages; Costs; abatement cost; emission control; emissions trading; environmental impact assessment; environmental policy; model; China; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101656694

In this context, this review summarizes the various wastewater treatment technologies which have been studied with a focus of bioaerosols emissions, potential emission stages, available sampling strategies, survival and dispersion factors, dominant microbial species in bioaerosols, and possible control approaches. Literature review revealed that most of the studies were devoted to sampling, enumerating and identifying cultivable microbial species of bioaerosols, as well as measuring their concentrations. However, the role of treatment technologies and their operational factors are investigated in limited studies only. Moreover, few studies have been reported to investigate the presence and concentrations of air borne virus and fungi in WWTP, as compared to bacterial species. The common environmental factors, affecting the survival and dispersion of bioaerosols, are observed as relative humidity, temperature, wind speed, and solar illumination. Further, research studies on recent episodes of COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2 virus) pandemic also revealed that continuous and effective surveillance on WWTPs associated bioaerosols may led to early sign for future pandemics. The evaluation of reported data is bit complicated, due to the variation in sampling approaches, ambient conditions, and site activities of each study. Therefore, such studies need a standardized methodology and improved guidance to help informed future policies, contextual research, and support a robust health-based risk assessment process.

The CC causes the rise of temperature (0.2-0.3°C/decade) and sea level (SRL = 5 mm/year), drought and floods to occur more frequently, the change of rainfall intensity and pattern and shifting of planting season and leads to the decreasing of crop yield or yield loss. Most of the paddy soil has been exhausted and degraded. About 50% of the rice field along the coastline is effected by high salinity and causes significant yield losses. The research was aimed to summarize the results of the system of organic based aerobic rice intensification (known as IPATBO) and of two climate filed school (CFS) in Cinganjeng and Rawapu that situated along the coastline of Pangandaran and Cilacap. Both IPATBO and CFS have adopted the strategy of climate-resilient sustainable agriculture (CRSA) for restoring the soil health and increasing rice productivity, and as well as to empower the farmer community. The implementation of IPATBO (2010-2020) in the different areas has increased the soil health, fertilizers, and water efficiency (reduce inorganic by 25-50%, and water by 30-40%) and increased rice productivity by at least 25-50%.

A prominent example of this occurs in southeastern Brazil, where the five local MPAs located within the highly eutrophic Guanabara Bay, in the state of Rio de Janeiro, are increasingly impacted by a largely urbanized and industrialized drainage basin. In this context, the aim of this study is to evaluate the anthropogenic impacts associated with the eutrophication of Guanabara Bay and its implications for MPA environmental services. Published studies indicate positive relationships between the temporal variability of the demographic density in Rio de Janeiro and geochemical sewage loading proxies in sediment cores (such as total phosphorus and inorganic phosphorus) obtained from MPA, as well as heavier nitrogen stable isotopes ratios (δ15N) of higher eutrophication estuaries along the bay area. The conservation of mangrove ecosystems against deforestation and landfill expansion is critically dependent on MPAs, as these ecosystems display a high carbon and nutrient accumulation capacity, contributing to eutrophication mitigation and decreased anthropogenic CO2 emissions to the atmosphere.

Karst.) and silver fir (Abies alba Mill.) stands in the Tarnița study area in Suceava. For northeastern Romania, the Tarnița mining operation constituted a hotspot of industrial pollution. The primary processing of non-ferrous ores containing heavy metals in the form of complex sulfides was the main cause of pollution in the Tarnița region from 1968 to 1990. Air pollution of Tarnița induced substantial tree growth reduction from 1978 to 1990, causing a decline in tree health and vitality. Growth decline in stands located over 6 km from the pollution source was weaker or absent. Spruce trees were much less affected by the phenomenon of local pollution than fir trees. We analyzed the dynamics of resilience indices and average radial growth indices and found that the period in which the trees suffered the most from local pollution was between 1978 and 1984. Growth recovery of the intensively polluted stand was observed after the 1990s when the environmental condition improved because of a significant reduction in air pollution. © 2021 by the authors.

Geopolymer concrete has been widely claimed to have lower global warming potential than OPC concrete, and this claim has formed the basis of many studies examining mix designs and mechanical properties of geopolymer concretes. A major limitation with the vast majority of existing studies is a lack of the direct quantification of the global warming potential of the materials developed. That is, the underlying assumption in the majority of these studies is that geopolymer concrete is more sustainable than OPC based concretes. The aim of this paper is to quantify the CO2 equivalent (CO2-eq) emissions associated with production of a large number of previously developed mix designs (1404 mix designs from 110 studies) including the impacts of curing, allocation and transportation and allowing for variation in energy grid source and the production of the activator solution. When considering the impact of transportation, a case study based on five major capital cities in Australia is presented and the critical transport distances at which the manufacture of geopolymers becomes more emissions intensive than conventional concrete is identified. The results show that the relative CO2-eq emissions of geopolymer and OPC based concretes of the same strength, are highly dependent on the system boundary for analysis, the type of allocation scenario and material transportation distances and mode, and further, that depending on these factors geopolymer concretes can either have significantly lower, or significantly higher CO2-eq emissions than OPC concretes of the same strength. It is expected that the findings of this work can aid in specifying the optimal concrete types for reducing CO2-eq emissions considering the intended use of the concrete. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide emissions; Geopolymer concrete manufacturing; Global warming potential; Ordinary portland cement; Sustainability","Carbon dioxide; Concretes; Geopolymers; Inorganic polymers; Manufacture; Materials handling; Portland cement; Sustainable development; Carbon dioxide emissions; Cement-based; Comprehensive assessment; Geopolymer; Geopolymer concrete; Geopolymer concrete manufacturing; Global warming potential; Mix designs; Ordinary Portland cement; Portland cement concretes; Global warming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102614009

This model serves as an alternative to the knowledge deficit model still in use in much science communication and is applicable both for students and practitioners of technical communication. Method: The model was developed by examining Matthew Nisbet’s work on framing in conjunction with Perelman and Olbrechts-Tyteca’s work on dissociation. I conducted a coded rhetorical analysis of two fact sheets produced by the Utah State University Extension Office with information on how their audience can change personal behaviors to mitigate their personal impact on climate change. I suggest how a dissociative frame would present the information more effectively. Results: A dissociative framing model can provide practitioners in technical and professional communication (TPC) a way to work around science skepticism and motivate action, especially when working with short, community-based genres, and can provide teachers of technical communication with a heuristic for instructing students on how to best engage a skeptical audience. Conclusion: While rural communities in the United States are especially prone to climate skepticism, it is important that they be informed and empowered to make the necessary behavioral changes to mitigate the human impact on climate change. Fact sheets published by extension services provide an excellent opportunity to inform and empower. A dissociative framing model provides a clear way to empower these communities with knowledge of how to mitigate their impact on climate change without diving into the political issues embroiled in climate science. © 2021, Society for Technical Communication.

On the Si-face, the reaction of the NO molecule results in the dissociation of the C-C single bond and the formation of Si4-N bonds with the CO2 molecule. In contrast, the C=C double bond changes into the C-C bond with the formation of Si3-N bonds and CO2 desorption on the C-face. This C-C bond on the C-face can be removed by the incorporation of an additional NO molecule. For the resultant interface structures, no localized electronic states are generated around the energy gap of 4H-SiC, suggesting that the NO annealing process is crucial to reduce the carbon-related defects at the 4H-SiC/SiO2 interface.

In photosynthesis of C4 plants, CO2 concentration is kept at higher levels around ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) by the cooperation of the mes-ophyll and bundle sheath cells, which enables them to assimilate CO2 at higher rates to survive under drought stress. However, the regulatory mechanism of photosynthetic electron transport for P700 oxidation is still poorly understood in C4 plants. Here, we assessed gas exchange, chlorophyll fluorescence, electrochromic shift, and near infrared absorbance in intact leaves of maize (a NADP-malic enzyme C4 subtype species) in comparison with mustard, a C3 plant. Instead of the alternative electron sink due to photorespiration in the C3 plant, photosynthetic linear electron flow was strongly suppressed between photosystems I and II, dependent on the difference of proton concentration across the thylakoid membrane (ΔpH) in response to the suppression of CO2 assimilation in maize. Linear relationships among CO2 assimilation rate, linear electron flow, P700 oxidation, ΔpH, and the oxidation rate of ferredoxin suggested that the increase of ΔpH for P700 oxidation was caused by the regulation of proton conductance of chloroplast ATP synthase but not by promoting cyclic electron flow. At the scale of intact leaves, the ratio of PSI to PSII was estimated almost 1:1 in both C3 and C4 plants. Overall, the photosynthetic electron transport was regulated for P700 oxidation in maize through the same strategies as in C3 plants only except for the capacity of photorespi-ration despite the structural and metabolic differences in photosynthesis between C3 and C4 plants. © 2021 by the authors.

However, there are few published research results and exploration discoveries on stratigraphic hydrocarbon accumulations in the Melut Basin. Based on information from the evaluation of the lithology assemblage, oil-source, migration pathway, preservation condition and the detailed analysis of typical exploration cases, the favorable exploratory interval, formation conditions and accumulation characteristics of the stratigraphic hydrocarbon accumulations have been studied in the northern Melut sub-basin. The sedimentary facies study indicated that the Upper Yabus Formation developed widespread delta front deposits with the lithology assemblage of “sand wrapped by mud”, which was conducive to forming depositional stratigraphic traps dominated by facies change or depositional pinchout. The Adar Formation is a set of mudstone deposition with a thickness of 200–600 m above the Yabus Formation and well sealed the Yabus and Samma hydrocarbon accumulations as the regional top seal. The parameters of organic matter, and the thickness and distribution of source rocks showed that the Al Renk Formation has good source rock quality with an average TOC value of 2.08% wt. and type II kerogen prone to oil generation. The thermal modelling revealed that the Al Renk source rocks continuously generated and expelled hydrocarbon since the Late Cretaceous to the present and provided sufficient oil source for the Upper Yabus stratigraphic traps. The tectonic evolution research showed that the multi-stage rifting cycles made the Melut Basin develop numerous normal faults, which provided essential vertical migration pathways for the hydrocarbon charging of the Paleogene stratigraphic traps. Among these faults, the basinal border faults and the intra-basinal late-rifting faults are the primary hydrocarbon conduit faults. The details of exploration cases showed that the hydrocarbon conduit faults are the key controlling factors for the formation of the Upper Yabus stratigraphic hydrocarbon accumulations, and the stratigraphic traps jointly dominated by lithology change (depositional pinchout) and hydrocarbon conduit faults have low hydrocarbon filling risk. The sandstones of the Upper Yabus Formation are shallow (700–2500 m) and have high porosity with a value of greater than 20% and high oil production of a few hundred to more than 1000 barrels per day. Therefore, the Upper Yabus Formation develops favorable petroleum geology conditions for the formation of stratigraphic hydrocarbon accumulations, and exploring such stratigraphic traps is of great significance to the increasing exploration in the mature northern Melut sub-basin. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Hydrocarbon accumulation; Melut basin; South Sudan; Stratigraphic trap; The upper yabus formation","facies; hydrocarbon exploration; hydrocarbon generation; hydrocarbon migration; lithology; lithostratigraphy; organic matter; source rock; tectonic evolution; Melut Basin; South Sudan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101994101

Yet, the quantitative effects of climate change and management practices on yield and global warming potential (GWP) of rice-winter wheat rotations are still uncertain. Objective: To investigate the key factors influencing the tradeoffs between yield and GHG of rice-winter wheat ecosystems in mid-eastern China over the two periods. Methods: In this study, the DeNitrification-DeComposition (DNDC) model was used to examine the spatio-temporal county-scale variations in yields of rice-winter wheat rotations and associated GHG (CH4, N2O) and GHG intensity (GHGI) over two periods (1980–1989, 2010–2019) in mid-eastern China. The DNDC model is driven by a county-scale database, consisting of meteorological data (79 stations), soil properties, management practice, and crop parameters for 213 counties. Eight scenarios were defined to isolate the individual and combined impacts of climate change, new cultivars adoption, and management practices on yields, GWP, and GHGI. Results and conclusions: Results revealed that the total yield increased by 48.7% over the two periods but stagnated in the 2010s; the average emission rate of CH4 and N2O in the two periods were 250.7, 196, 0.63 and 2.83 kg ha−1, respectively, while GWP and GHGI declined by 12.8% and 38.3%. The individual contributions of climate change, new cultivars adoption, and management practices to the GHGI of the rice-winter wheat rotations were 37%, −42.5%, and 16.4%, respectively. Adoption of new cultivars was a decisive factor for improving yields and mitigating GHG, while climate change and management practices had a minor influence on yields. The negative responses of yield to improved management practices (i.e., high N fertilization, mid-season drainage) were mainly attributed to soil organic carbon (SOC) and bulk density variations and different fertilization patterns. The combination of new cultivars adoption and management practices decreased GHGI by 46.6%. These findings demonstrate the importance of high-yield crop varieties to low carbon agriculture, and that management practices should be adapted to local conditions and specific crop varieties. Significance: Given that the crop harvest index is approaching its theoretical upper limit and that promoting new varieties presents many challenges, future innovations should focus on introducing optimal strategies that balance the tradeoffs between yield and GHG emissions to mitigate the negative effects of climate change on agriculture. © 2021 Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology","Climate change; DNDC; GHGI; Management practices; New cultivars adoption","agricultural ecosystem; climate change; crop plant; crop rotation; crop yield; cultivar; global warming; management practice; quantitative analysis; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100688932

More and more effort has been focused on improving LCZ mapping accuracy. It has become a prevalent trend to take advantage of multi-source images in LCZ mapping. To this end, this paper tried to utilize multi-source freely available datasets: Sentinel-2 multispectral instrument (MSI), Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR), Luojia1-01 nighttime light (NTL), and Open Street Map (OSM) datasets to produce the 10 m LCZ classification result using Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Additionally, the derived datasets of Sentinel-2 MSI data were also exploited in LCZ classification, such as spectral indexes (SI) and gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM) datasets. The different dataset combinations were designed to evaluate the particular dataset’s contribution to LCZ classification. It was found that: (1) The synergistic use of Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-1 SAR data can improve the accuracy of LCZ classification; (2) The multi-seasonal information of Sentinel data also has a good contribution to LCZ classification; (3) OSM, GLCM, SI, and NTL datasets have some positive contribution to LCZ classification when individually adding them to the seasonal Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets; (4) It is not an absolute right way to improve LCZ classification accuracy by combining as many datasets as possible. With the help of the GEE, this study provides the potential to generate more accurate LCZ mapping on a large scale, which is significant for urban development. © 2021 by the authors.

The mass concentrations, water-soluble inorganic ions, organic and inorganic carbon concentrations, and inorganic elements constituting PM2.5 were determined, principal component analysis was used to identify potential sources of PM2.5, and the backward trajectory model was used to calculate the contribution of the long-distance transmission of air particles to the Wenshan area. The average concentration of PM2.5 in spring and autumn was 44.85 ± 10.99 µg/m3. Secondary inorganic aerosols contributed 21.82% and 16.50% of the total PM2.5 in spring and autumn, respectively. The daily mean value of OC/EC indicated that the measured SOC content was generated by the photochemical processes active during the sampling days. However, elements from anthropogenic sources (Ti, Si, Ca, Fe, Al, K, Mg, Na, Sb, Zn, P, Pb, Mn, As and Cu) accounted for 99.38% and 99.24% of the total inorganic elements in spring and autumn, respectively. Finally, source apportionment showed that SIA, dust, industry, biomass burning, motor vehicle emissions and copper smelting emissions constituted the major components in Wenshan.

Urbanization can significantly impact land-cover properties, surface heating, and emissions of air pollutants. To control the spread of COVID-19, China imposed very rigorous restrictions, leading to dramatic reductions in air pollutants (except O3) from satellite and ground-based data. As such, inter-transportation of air pollutants was weak during the lockdown, which was conducive to discuss the impacts of urbanization on the air quality. During the lockdown, the rates of surface PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and CO reductions in different urban types ranged from 6.6% to 62.4% in the YRD. Urbanization exerted great impacts on the pollutant variations in urban agglomerations despite such large decreases in primary pollution in YRD. Lower values of AOD and tropospheric NO2 columns were noticeably observed over large cities during the lockdown. The extents of surface PM, SO2, NO2 and CO reductions in large cities (first-tier and second-tier) were found to be larger (4.7%–10.6%) than those in small-medium cities (third-tier and fourth-tier) during the lockdown, which was also the case for the extent of the increase (33.0%–53.0%) in O3. PCA analysis revealed that the PM decreases in large cities made greater improvement in the air quality compared with the small cities during lockdown, while the urbanization had non-obvious influence on the photochemical reactions. It is imperative to adopt policies and programs to mitigate the air pollution in urban agglomerations in the fast urbanization process. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air quality; COVID-19; The yangtze river delta; Urbanization","Agglomeration; Air quality; Nitrogen oxides; Photochemical reactions; Reduction; River pollution; Urban growth; % reductions; Air pollutants; COVID-19; Large cities; NO $-2$; SO$-2$; The yangtze river delta; Urban agglomerations; Urbanization; Yangtze river delta; Rivers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102043134

Forest fragmentation affects ecosystem functioning and biodiversity in multiple ways. Here, we ask how forest fragmentation influences aboveground biomass storage (AGB) in sub-tropical forests in China. We established 207 20 m × 20 m plots within 69 forest fragments of varying size. Forest fragmentation process simulation was carried out via repeated quadrat sampling using different sized quadrats in two non-fragmented stands. AGB was estimated and compared across forest fragments and quadrats with different sizes within two non-fragmented stands. Our results indicate that AGB is significantly lower in forest fragments than in quadrats within two non-fragmented forests. In addition, species richness and abundance were lower in fragmented stands, respectively. In fragmented forests, the average diameter at breast height (DBH) increased with decreasing patch size, while declined for non-fragmented plots. Species richness, abundance, and mean DBH have strongly positive effects on AGB. This was the case both in forest fragments and quadrats within two non-fragmented forests. Forest fragmentation leads to lower richness, lower abundance, and higher mean DBH in forest fragments than in the two non-fragmented forests. Our results suggest that forest fragmentation increases edge habitats, which drastically decreases forests aboveground biomass storage. These results show that land degradation not only reduces the area of forests, but also reduces the aboveground biomass carbon density of forests. © 2021 by the authors.

However, health is reported to be less active in climate adaptation than other sectors. To contribute to better understanding urban health adaptation efforts and identifying gaps we developed a City Climate Health Adaptation Typology and tested it with adaptation actions of 106 large world cities (population > 1 million) reported to a major publicly-available adaptation database. We found two-thirds of actions of these ‘active adapter’ cities were health-associated. Half were health information activities (e.g., hazard mapping, early warnings); and nearly one-third addressed climate-relevant health determinants in the urban built environment (e.g., green space). Forty percent of cities were in low- or middle-income countries. Our proposed typology provides a systematic framework for monitoring and comparing city health adaptation actions. Reported city actions are suggestive of increasing depth and breadth of urban health-associated adaptation. However, even among these adaptation-engaged cities, a health adaptation gap was apparent in key climate health services (e.g., mental health), and in climate-related public health governance and capacity building. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated pressing need for strong public health institutions. We recommend better integration of public health agencies into local climate action planning, enhanced modes of collaboration between health and non-health agencies and with non-governmental actors, and strengthening of city public health adaptive capacity including through networking. © 2020","Adaptation; Cities; Climate change; Public health","action plan; adaptive management; climate change; COVID-19; epidemic; governance approach; health impact; identification method; institutional framework; public health; typology; biotypology; built environment; capacity building; city; city planning; climate change; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; high income country; human; medical information; mental health; middle income country; pandemic; priority journal; public health; urban area; urban health; city; climate change; Cities; City Planning; Climate Change; COVID-19; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Urban Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097215202

This study innovatively uses an agroecosystem indicator, growing degree days (GDD), to understand the change in cotton crop phenology throughout the region and develop adaptation strategies using the Driver‐Pressure‐State‐Impact‐Response (DPSIR) framework. GDD is the amount of heat absorbed by the growing stages of cotton. It is computed from temperature simulations obtained from the 21 models participating in the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) for the historical (1950–2005) and future scenarios (Representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5, 2006–2100) at a spatial resolution of 0.125°x0.125°. The future projections from the 21 models show an increase in surface temperature ranging from 3.5 °C to 5.5 °C. Additionally, the variability in dates for the different phenological stages shows an early occurrence of the simulation's growth stages. Historically, the minimum and maximum ranges of trend shift towards the funnel's negative side in the RCP 8.5 scenarios. The trends are estimated for two time-periods during historical (1950–1975 and 1976–2005) and future (2006–2050 and 2015–2100) periods of time. They ranged from −3.5 to 3.4 days per decade and −3.6 to 0 (no change) days per decade, respectively, among the six stages namely: emergence stage, the appearance of the first square, the appearance of the first flower, peak blooming, first open boll, and defoliation. Warming accelerated plant growth and shortened the growing period, which is translated to develop adaptation strategies for a climate-resilient crop production system, using casual chain/loops and the DPSIR framework.

Overall, China’s action to adapt to climate change remains in its infancy, and relevant research needs to be further deepened. In this paper, we study the future adaptive countermeasures of Shenzhen city in the Pearl River Delta in terms of climate change, especially urban flood risk resilience. Based on the background investigation of urban flood risk in Shenzhen, this paper calculates the annual precipitation frequency of Shenzhen from 1953 to 2020, and uses the extreme precipitation index as a quantitative indicator to analyze the changes in historical precipitation and the impact of major flood disasters in Shenzhen city in previous decades. Based on the six kinds of model data of the scenario Model Inter-comparison Project (MIP) in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6), uses the Taylor diagram and MR comprehensive evaluation method to evaluate the ability of different climate models to simulate extreme precipitation in Shenzhen, and the selected models are aggregated and averaged to predict the climate change trend of Shenzhen from 2020 to 2100. The prediction results show that Shenzhen will face more severe threats from rainstorms and floods in the future. Therefore, this paper proposes a resilience strategy for the city to cope with the threat of flood in the future, including constructing a smart water management system and promoting the development of a sponge city. Moreover, to a certain extent, it is necessary to realize risk transfer by promoting a flood insurance system. © 2021 by the authors.

Thus, the urban transportation has become a critical part of energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions. The excessive dependence of urban transportation on high-emission fuels is the main obstacle to develop a low-carbon transport. Meanwhile, natural gas is a bridge fuel to develop a low-emission transport. To the best of our knowledge, there has been little attention towards the association between the development of natural gas-fueled vehicles and the CO2 emission. Therefore, the problem we studied is the role of compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicles in replacing high-emission fuels. In this study, we aimed to study this association by selecting the system dynamics approach due to the complexities of the social-economic system of transportation. In this modeling, different subsystems of the transport fleet were employed including CNG vehicles and urban transportation subsystems. Iran has used CNG as an alternative fuel in the transportation sector, making it one of the three leading countries in the use of natural gas in the urban transportation system. Our case study is focused on Tehran, which is the capital and the largest city of Iran. In this paper, we considered several scenarios to replace the gasoline fuel in the private car sector and taxis and diesel fuel in the bus fleet with natural CNG fuel. The results show that the replacement of CNG fuel with high-emission fuels can have a significant effect on reducing CO2 emissions. In the synthetic scenario, CO2 emission will be decreased by 11.42% in 2030, as compared to the business as usual (BAU) scenario in this year. According to Iran's commitment to the Paris Agreement, the emission of CO2 in Iran should normally be reduced by 4% in 2030, as compared to its amount in the BAU scenario. Therefore, Iran can easily fulfill its obligations in the urban transport sector only by replacing gasoline and diesel fuel with CNG. © 2020 The Author(s) 2020.

The most common routes of exposure to arsenic for humans are drinking water, food, and to a lesser extent inhalation. Monitoring arsenic airborne levels becomes increasingly important. Using advanced X-ray synchrotron radiation based techniques, the occurrence of arsenic in coarse and fine particulates was investigated, namely in total suspended particulate (TSP) and particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter equal or less than 2.5 μm (PM2.5). Synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence was used to obtain elemental maps of arsenic in selected ambient air particulate samples. Making use of the tunability of the synchrotron source, excitation photon energies below or above the arsenic K edge (13.6 and 12.5 keV) were employed together with precise spectral de-convolution procedures, to fully elucidate the occurrence of arsenic in the spectra, and properly assess and avoid the contribution of spectral interferences in between As-K emission lines and those of Ga-Kβ, Bi-L, and L1,2 series of Pb. In the case of total suspended particulates collected from the industrial area, high content of arsenic was found (2.9 ± 0.7 ng m-3) where activities such as cement industry and alloy smelters are performed. In addition, for selected spots of high concentration in arsenic at the TSP samples, the speciation of arsenic was investigated using X-ray absorption near edge structure at the As K-edge. Applying linear combination fitting procedures to the XANES data, we could determine that 82% of the arsenic species exist in the trivalent oxidation state, whereas only 18% reveal to be present in the pentavalent oxidation state. In the case of the PM2.5 aerosol from the industrial area, the cartographies of arsenic were successfully accomplished but the XANES measurements could not be achieved due to the low concentration of arsenic (1.6 ± 0.6 ng m-3). © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,"Absorption spectra; Arsenic; Cement industry; Fluorescence; Gallium compounds; Health risks; Maps; Particles (particulate matter); Potable water; Superconducting materials; Synchrotron radiation; Synchrotrons; X ray absorption; X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy; Aerodynamic diameters; Linear combinations; Spectral interference; Synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence; Synchrotron x-ray fluorescences; Total suspended particulates; X ray absorption near edge structure; X-ray synchrotron radiation; Chemical contamination",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105776971

Since overbank flooding has been considered the driving factor of vegetation distribution on floodplains, sustainable water resource management requires a better understanding of the influence of inundation on vegetation distribution. We examined the relationship between the distribution of four flood-dependant vegetation communities and associated long term inundation metrics on the upper Darling River floodplain using electivity analysis and a generalised additive model (GAM) by generating a total of 10,478 individual inundation maps with a high spatial resolution over a period of 29 years. Our results show that the four dominant vegetation communities are situated differently in relation to inundation attributes. The inundation metrics better explained the variation in the distribution of River Red Gum than those of Black box, Coolabah and Lignum communities. We found that the floodplain forests and woodlands in the upper Darling can survive longer periods of drought and shorter inundation duration than previously reported.

Moreover, it has become quite a challenge for organizations to retain their volunteers. In this regard, the current study was aimed at finding out how the factors of work climate and intrinsic motivation influence the continuance intention of the sports volunteers in China in the presence of three mediating variables, attitude, emotional exhaustion and volunteer satisfaction.

In Indonesia, the Southeast Asian country in the tropical climate zone, the increasing heat wave duration due to climate change will be also magnified by projected rapid urbanization. Therefore, not only climate change mitigation measures but also adaptation solutions to more frequent extreme weather events are necessary. Adaptation is essential at local levels. The projected increase of the heat wave duration will trigger greater health-related risks. It will also drive higher energy demands, particularly in urban areas, for cooling. New smart solutions for growing urbanization for reducing urban heat island phenomenon are critical, but in order to identify them, analyzing the changing magnitude and spatial distribution of urban heat is essential. We projected the current and future spatial variability of heat stress index in three cities in Indonesia, namely, Medan, Surabaya, and Denpasar, under climate change and land-cover change scenarios, and quantified it with the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) for two periods, baseline (1981–2005) and future (2018–2042). Our results demonstrated that currently the higher level of the UTCI was identified in the urban centers of all three cities, indicating the contribution of urban heat island phenomenon to the higher UTCI. Under climate change scenarios, all three cities will experience increase of the heat, whereas applying the land-cover scenario demonstrated that in only Medan and Denpasar, the UTCI is likely to experience a higher increase by 3.1°C; however, in Surabaya, the UTCI will experience 0.84°C decrease in the period 2018–2042 due to urban greening.

Here, we present a new, ∼annually resolved speleothem record of stable isotope (δ18O and δ13C) and trace element (Mg/Ca and Sr/Ca) ratios for a section of the mid-Holocene (5.2–5.7 kyr BP), before extensive agriculture began in the region. A meter-long stalagmite from Río Secreto, a cave system in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, was dated using U–Th geochronology and layer counting, yielding multidecadal age uncertainty (median 2SD of ±70 years). New proxy data were compared to an existing late Holocene stalagmite record from the same cave system, allowing us to examine changes in hydrology over time and to paleoclimate records from the southern YP. The δ18O, δ13C, and Mg/Ca data consistently indicate higher mean precipitation and lower precipitation variability during the mid-Holocene compared to the late Holocene. Despite this reduced variability, multidecadal precipitation variations were persistent in regional hydroclimate during the mid-Holocene. We therefore conclude that higher summer insolation led to increased mean precipitation and decreased precipitation variability in the northern YP but that the region is susceptible to dry periods across climate mean states. Given projected decreases in wet season precipitation in the YP’s near future, we suggest that climate mitigation strategies emphasize drought preparation. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

Since the intensity–duration–frequency (IDF) curve is an important tool to design infrastructures in water resources management, updating IDF curves under future climate projections nowadays becomes a necessary practice. Therefore, we intended to investigate potential changes in the IDF curves due to climate change using the equidistance quantile matching method in the wettest region of Turkey. We aimed to examine two critical issues: (i) the estimation of changes in IDF curves for three future periods (namely, 2013–2039, 2040–2069, and 2070–2099) and (ii) a comparison analysis between the outcomes based on the two worst-case climate change scenarios (namely, SRES A2 and RCP 8.5) released for the fourth and fifth assessment reports by the IPCC. Our analysis results showed that the outcomes based on SRES A2 revealed an increase in intensities during all the future periods for recurrence intervals under 50 years. According to the outcomes of recurrence interval above 50 years, there is an increase in intensities at the beginning period of the century; however, a decrease in intensities prevails at the ending period of the century. On the contrary, the results based on RCP 8.5 showed that there is a decrease in intensities at the beginning of the century while there is an increase in intensities at the end of the century for all return periods. Our results were discussed according to the indications of the IPCC 5th assessment report. Although conflicting indications were noted between the two worst-case scenarios, our study results may be an inspiration to call a need to update all former design storms based on IDF in any region all over the globe. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Austria, part of Springer Nature.",,"climate change; climate effect; comparative study; frequency analysis; precipitation intensity; temporal variation; Rize [Turkey]; Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102923653

The ecological problem is one of the global problems of our time. Disposal of household waste and their pollution of the environment is currently one of the most serious environmental problems in Russia. Human waste products also significantly affect the pollution of water bodies, since water that is used in cities for the needs of the population from the sewage system often enters directly into open water bodies, bypassing the system of treatment facilities, the quality of which leaves much to be desired: most of them almost cannot cope with their functions due to outdated and deteriorated equipment. In Russia, the national project Ecology has been adopted, since the need for the introduction of new technologies that do not harm the environment has long been acute. The subject of the study is the investment of enterprises and organizations in environmental innovations for the preservation of natural resources. The purpose of the study is the necessity and significance of investments in high-tech projects to improve the environmental situation and reduce emissions of pollutants into the air. Methodology. The financial support of the new national project Ecology has been studied. The companies that successfully implement the latest technologies in their production, focused on reducing the harm caused to the environment, thereby attracting investments in their projects, are highlighted. Results. Enterprises will be able to attract investments for the development of their own production only if they are attractive to investors, for whom such aspects of work as the introduction of modern technologies, taking into account the minimization of harm to the environment, are extremely important. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Environmental protection; Investments; Planning; Sewage; Waste disposal; Waste treatment; Water pollution; Disposal of household wastes; Ecological problem; Environmental innovations; Environmental problems; High-tech projects; Investment projects; Modern technologies; Preservation of natural resources; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107265500

An ecological engineering system mimics a natural ecosystem by balancing the trophic conditions for effective treatment of wastewater in a sequential manner. The present study was designed using emergent, floating and submerged macrophytic plants in a systematic approach. The study was evaluated with several components such as plants (water hyacinth, water lettuce and water thymes), aeration (supply of oxygen), and physical adsorption (activated carbon). Domestic wastewater collected from the local effluent treatment plant was treated individually and by combining all the components. Diverse experimental setups viz., lake sediment (control reactor), aeration, activated carbon blocks, water hyacinth, water lettuce, and water thymes were individually studied. Further the above components were combined, such as lake sediment + aeration + activated carbon blocks with plants like water hyacinth, water lettuce, and water thymes. The study inferred along with phytoremediation, and the external factors enhanced the treatment performances. Water hyacinth documented enhanced chemical oxygen demand removal efficiency of 85.71%, followed by water lettuce (80%), and water thymes (77.14%) along with the plants, both aeration, and activated carbon had stimulated the wastewater treatment. The highest removal efficiency of nitrate (70.23%), phosphate (63.64%), and sulphate (61.16%) were observed in water hyacinth due to its thick roots, and fibrous tissues reported effective treatment. The study hypothesized that these processes could be an effective strategy to restore the lakes and regulate the environmental flow. The study infers that an ecological engineering system symbiotically enables to self-organize the ecosystem within the boundary. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Aquatic macrophytes; Emergent plants; Restoration of lakes; Self-purification; Wastewater treatment; Water scarcity","activated carbon; dissolved oxygen; lake water; nitrate; phosphate; sulfate; chemical oxygen demand; ecological engineering; effluent; lacustrine deposit; phosphate; phytoremediation; submerged vegetation; sulfate; sustainability; trophic conditions; wastewater treatment; water stress; adsorption; aeration; Article; chemical oxygen demand; controlled study; domestic waste; ecosystem restoration; Eichhornia crassipes; energy resource; engineering; hydraulic retention time; lake sediment; lettuce; macrophyte; nonhuman; oxidation reduction potential; oxidation reduction reaction; phytoremediation; plant growth; rhizosphere; solar energy; thyme; turbidity; waste component removal; waste water management; water insecurity; Araceae; bioremediation; ecosystem; Eichhornia; wastewater; water management; water pollutant; Eichhornia crassipes; Pistia stratiotes; Araceae; Biodegradation, Environmental; Ecosystem; Eichhornia; Waste Water; Water Pollutants, Chemical; Water Purification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102140428

Understanding the distribution of UES across a landscape can help managers ensure an equitable distribution of services. While many past studies have focused on the distribution of green spaces in relation to socioeconomic variables, this research analyzes the distribution of UES provided by these green spaces. This research quantified air pollution removal, atmospheric carbon reduction, and surface runoff mitigation provided by urban trees in Strasbourg city (France). The provision of these three UES was studied at the census block scale by creating an index of UES delivery, which was contrasted with a constructed social deprivation index. Our results show that there is no significant association between the delivery of UES and social deprivation. Some deprived populations benefit from high UES delivery. Results also suggest that mapping associations between UES delivery and social deprivation should be integrated with future development plans to enhance the equitable distribution of UES. This study provides insights into the French context where studies about the distribution of UES at a small-area level remain lacking. © 2020, Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.","Deprivation; Environmental justice; Urban ecosystem services; Urban trees","atmospheric pollution; development project; ecosystem service; environmental issue; environmental justice; greenspace; index method; landscape planning; prioritization; service provision; socioeconomic impact; urban ecosystem; Bas Rhin; France; Grand Est; Strasbourg; air pollution; city; ecosystem; France; tree; Air Pollution; Cities; Ecosystem; France; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096580294

Mountain systems have been rec-ognized as both resilient and extremely threatened by climate change, requiring a more nuanced understanding of potential trajectories of the biotic communities. For high elevation systems in particular, we need to consider how the interactions among climate drivers and topography currently structure the diversity, species composition, and life-history strategies of these communities. Further, predicting biotic responses to changing climate requires knowledge of intra-and inter-specific climate associations within the context of topographically heterogenous landscapes. Changes in temperature, snow, and rain characteristics at regional scales are amplified or attenuated by slope, aspect, and wind patterns occurring at local scales that are often under a hectare or even a meter in extent. Community assemblages are structured by the soil moisture and growing season duration at these local sites, and directional climate change has the potential to alter these two drivers together, independently, or in opposition to one another due to local, intervening variables. Changes threaten species whose water and growing season duration requirements are locally extirpated or species who may be outcompeted by nearby faster-growing, warmer/drier adapted species. However, barring non-analogue climate conditions, species may also be able to more easily track required resource regimes in topographically heterogenous landscapes. New species arrivals composed of competitors, predators and pathogens can further mediate the direct impacts of the changing climate. Plants are moving uphill, demonstrating primary succession with the emergence of new habitats from snow and rock, but these shifts are constrained over the short term by soil limitations and microbes and ultimately by the lack of colonizable terrestrial surfaces. Meanwhile, both subalpine herbaceous and woody species pose threats to more cold-adapted species. Overall, the multiple interacting direct and indirect effects of the changing climate on high elevation systems may lead to multiple potential trajectories for these systems. © 2021 by the authors.

Here, we incorporate health co-benefits into estimates of the optimal climate policy for three different climate policy regimes. The first fully internalizes the climate externality at the global level via a uniform carbon price (the 'cooperative equilibrium'), thus minimizing total mitigation costs. The second connects to the concept of 'common but differentiated responsibilities' where nations coordinate their actions while accounting for different national capabilities considering socioeconomic conditions. The third assumes nations act only in their own self-interest. We find that air quality co-benefits motivate substantially reduced emissions under all three policy regimes, but that some form of global cooperation is required to prevent runaway temperature rise. However, co-benefits do warrant high levels of mitigation in certain regions even in the self-interested case, suggesting that air quality impacts may expand the range of possible policy outcomes whereby global temperatures do not increase unabated. © 2021 The Author(s).

This study produces an environmental justice conceptual framework that references the scholarship on environmental justice and environmental governance, outlines the elements required to introduce environmental justice debates into treaty preambles, and gives an example of its application to determine whether the preambles include justice concepts. The preambles selected are from treaties with broad geographic and subject matter scope: they regulate oceans, climate, and biodiversity, the transport of waste, mercury pollution, migratory and endangered species, and wetlands. Using the environmental justice conceptual framework, the study found a justice gap between how justice is addressed in justice debates and literatures and the stated intent of the contracting parties in the preambles.

If geothermal systems are to be cost-efficient and are to enjoy public confidence, it is essential that they are designed and installed in accordance with the prevailing site-specific conditions. A thorough understanding of the thermal behaviour of the surrounding ground is, therefore, critical. In this work, we investigated temperature and its evolution in the vicinity of a shallow geothermal helix-shaped borehole heat exchanger (BHE). To measure the temperature close to the actual geothermal system, an additional U-tube probe was installed at the edge of the same borehole. A thermal load was then applied to the BHE, and the temperature was detected in the nearby U-tube. The temperature measurements were made with a GEOSniff monitoring device. To understand these localised temperature measurements in the context of the Valencia test site, ERT measurements were also performed.

But some fires exhibit ‘overwintering’ behaviour, in which they smoulder through the non-fire season and flare up in the subsequent spring4,5. In boreal (northern) forests, deep organic soils favourable for smouldering6, along with accelerated climate warming7, may present unusually favourable conditions for overwintering. However, the extent of overwintering in boreal forests and the underlying factors influencing this behaviour remain unclear. Here we show that overwintering fires in boreal forests are associated with hot summers generating large fire years and deep burning into organic soils, conditions that have become more frequent in our study areas in recent decades. Our results are based on an algorithm with which we detect overwintering fires in Alaska, USA, and the Northwest Territories, Canada, using field and remote sensing datasets. Between 2002 and 2018, overwintering fires were responsible for 0.8 per cent of the total burned area; however, in one year this amounted to 38 per cent. The spatiotemporal predictability of overwintering fires could be used by fire management agencies to facilitate early detection, which may result in reduced carbon emissions and firefighting costs. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"boreal forest; carbon emission; fire management; forest fire; human activity; overwintering; remote sensing; spatiotemporal analysis; Alaska; Article; carbon footprint; climate change; climate warming; detection algorithm; fire ecology; forest fire; Northwest Territories; overwintering fire; priority journal; remote sensing; snow cover; taiga; algorithm; economics; human activities; lightning; prevention and control; satellite imagery; season; spatiotemporal analysis; time factor; wildfire; Alaska; Canada; Northwest Territories; United States; Alaska; Algorithms; Climate Change; Human Activities; Lightning; Northwest Territories; Satellite Imagery; Seasons; Spatio-Temporal Analysis; Taiga; Time Factors; Wildfires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106288564

Climate-warming-induced deepening of ground thaw puts such infrastructure at risk of failure. For better assessing the risk of large-scale future damage to Arctic infrastructure, improved strategies for model-based approaches are urgently needed. We used the laterally coupled 1D heat conduction model CryoGrid3 to simulate permafrost degradation affected by linear infrastructure. We present a case study of a gravel road built on continuous permafrost (Dalton highway, Alaska) and forced our model under historical and strong future warming conditions (following the RCP8.5 scenario). As expected, the presence of a gravel road in the model leads to higher net heat flux entering the ground compared to a reference run without infrastructure and thus a higher rate of thaw. Further, our results suggest that road failure is likely a consequence of lateral destabilisation due to talik formation in the ground beside the road rather than a direct consequence of a top-down thawing and deepening of the active layer below the road centre. In line with previous studies, we identify enhanced snow accumulation and ponding (both a consequence of infrastructure presence) as key factors for increased soil temperatures and road degradation. Using differing horizontal model resolutions we show that it is possible to capture these key factors and their impact on thawing dynamics with a low number of lateral model units, underlining the potential of our model approach for use in pan-Arctic risk assessments. Our results suggest a general two-phase behaviour of permafrost degradation: an initial phase of slow and gradual thaw, followed by a strong increase in thawing rates after the exceedance of a critical ground warming. The timing of this transition and the magnitude of thaw rate acceleration differ strongly between undisturbed tundra and infrastructure-affected permafrost ground. Our model results suggest that current model-based approaches which do not explicitly take into account infrastructure in their designs are likely to strongly underestimate the timing of future Arctic infrastructure failure. By using a laterally coupled 1D model to simulate linear infrastructure, we infer results in line with outcomes from more complex 2D and 3D models, but our model's computational efficiency allows us to account for long-term climate change impacts on infrastructure from permafrost degradation. Our model simulations underline that it is crucial to consider climate warming when planning and constructing infrastructure on permafrost as a transition from a stable to a highly unstable state can well occur within the service lifetime (about 30 years) of such a construction. Such a transition can even be triggered in the coming decade by climate change for infrastructure built on high northern latitude continuous permafrost that displays cold and relatively stable conditions today. © 2021 Thomas Schneider von Deimling et al.",,"acceleration; brittle failure; complexity; degradation; failure mechanism; freeze-thaw cycle; frozen ground; gravel; heat flux; infrastructure; permafrost; risk assessment; soil temperature; warming; Arctic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107293316

Here, we demonstrate an advanced coaxial GaAs-InGaAs multi-quantum well (MQW) nanowire laser that solves previous limitations by the introduction of a strain compensating InAlGaAs buffer layer between the GaAs core and the MQW active region. Using a buffer layer thickness comparable to the core diameter applies a significant tensile strain to the GaAs core which efficiently minimizes the compressive strain in the InGaAs MQW and enables large In-content without plastic relaxation. Experimental verification is shown for NW-lasers with an In-content of up to 40% in the MQW, evidencing a clear strain-relieved redshift of the lasing emission and a strong reduction of the lasing threshold compared to highly strained MQWs in state-of-the-art GaAs NW-lasers.

However, the employment perspectives in rural areas are decreasing, and thus the urban growth can become a driver for enhanced livelihoods in the rural areas. Since urbanisation in Africa requires high amount of concrete, the conversion of agricultural waste materials to sustainable concrete constituents does not only create new rural and urban income possibilities, it can also help Africa's construction industry to spearhead green concrete technologies, and thus to reduce carbon emission worldwide. From vegetable wastes chemical admixtures can be derived as well as reactive mineral cement substitutes, which help to use concrete more efficiently and reduce the ordinary Portland cement clinker in concrete, respectively. The authors of this paper discuss the potentials and shortcomings of using agricultural waste materials for construction materials and propose a synergistic three-step process chain to obtain polysaccharides, biochar, and a reactive ash. The process requires boiling, hydrolysis and vertical shaft kiln technology, respectively, to obtain maximum useable products with minimum generation of climate gases. Eventually, the process chain is discussed in conjunction with possible rural to urban circular economic potentials in the concrete construction business. © 2021 The Author(s)","Africa; Biochar; Cement; Circular economy; CONCRETE; Hydrolysis; Polysaccharides; Sub-saharan africa; Sustainability; Urbanisation; Vertical shaft kiln","Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Concrete additives; Concrete industry; Concrete mixtures; Construction industry; Green manufacturing; Portland cement; Rural areas; Chemical admixture; Economic potentials; Minimum generations; Ordinary Portland cement; Reactive minerals; Sub-saharan africa; Sustainable concretes; Three-step process; Urban growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106906328

Photons are emitted when strongly bound excitons decay radiatively, and accurate models of such excitons are important for a full understanding of the emission. Importantly, photons are emitted in directions uniquely determined by the exciton center of mass momentum and with lifetimes determined by the exciton transition matrix element. The exciton band structures of two-dimensional hexagonal materials, including TMDs, are highly unusual with coexisting particle- and light-like bands. The latter is nonanalytic with emission selection rules essentially opposite to the particle-like states, but has been ignored in analyses of TMD light emission so far. In the present work, we analyze the temperature and angular dependence of light emission from both exciton species and point out several important consequences of the unique exciton band structure. Within a first-principles density-functional-theory+Bethe-Salpeter-equation framework, we compute exciton band structures and optical matrix elements for the important TMDs MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2. At low temperature, only the particle-like band is populated and our results agree with previous work. However, at slightly elevated temperatures, a significant population of the light-like band leads to modified angular emission patterns and lifetimes. Clear experimental fingerprints are predicted and explained by a simple four-state model incorporating spin-orbit as well as intervalley exchange coupling. © 2021 American Physical Society.",,"Density functional theory; Energy gap; Layered semiconductors; Light; Light emission; Molybdenum compounds; Monolayers; Photons; Spin orbit coupling; Temperature; Transition metals; Tungsten compounds; Bethe-Salpeter equation; Direct band gap semiconductors; Elevated temperature; First-principles density functional theory; Hexagonal materials; Light emitting devices; Optical matrix element; Transition metal dichalcogenides; Excitons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106025317

Factor analysis method is used to find the success factors of socialization in the face of climate change, then the regression analysis method is used to build a model of a number of variables that are formed from the analysis of output factors.

Specifically, the building sector is one of the main responsible activities. In order to minimize the ecological footprint and ensure energy sufficiency, European Union created the nearly-Zero Energy Building (nZEB) concept. More than ten years have elapsed and it worth to review the current state around the concept, considering the new advances in computer development that are already applicable to this field. Accordingly, recent researches published in reputed indexed journals and international conferences have been reviewed. This paper explains the nZEB concept and reviews research articles focused on achieving it. A research gap is detected, so enabling concepts and technologies as Building Energy Performance Simulation (BEPS) tools and Model Predictive Control (MPC) are recalled, and relevant researches where used are included in a specific state-of-the-art for each concept, since the academia considers that these tools should be applied in building air conditioning to achieve nZEB. After this deep analysis, we conclude that the possibilities to optimize the energy consumption are huge combining properly in a holistic way BEPS tools for modeling and simulation and MPC for control strategies. It is possible to manage a Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system using Renewable Energy Sources (RES) in an effective means, reducing CO2 emissions problems worldwide and reaching considerable energy savings. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Building energy systems; Energy-efficient buildings; Model predictive control; MPC; Nearly-zero energy buildings; nZEB","Air conditioning; Carbon dioxide; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Model predictive control; Predictive control systems; Renewable energy resources; Building energy performance; Control strategies; Ecological footprint; Energy sufficiency; Model and simulation; Recent researches; Renewable energy source; State-of-the art reviews; Zero energy buildings",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101830604

Anthropogenic emissions that are harmful to human health have been reduced substantially under COVID-19 lockdown. Satellite remote sensing for air pollution assessments can be highly effective in public health research because of the possibility of estimating air pollution levels over large scales. In this study, we utilized both satellite and surface measurements to estimate air pollution levels in 20 cities across the world. Google Earth Engine (GEE) and Sentinel-5 Precursor TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) application were used for both spatial and time-series assessment of tropospheric Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) and Carbon Monoxide (CO) statuses during the study period (1 February to May 11, 2019 and the corresponding period in 2020). We also measured Population-Weighted Average Concentration (PWAC) of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) and NO2 using gridded population data and in-situ air pollution estimates. We estimated the economic benefit of reduced anthropogenic emissions using two valuation approaches: (1) the median externality value coefficient approach, applied for satellite data, and (2) the public health burden approach, applied for in-situ data. Satellite data have shown that ~28 tons (sum of 20 cities) of NO2 and ~184 tons (sum of 20 cities) of CO have been reduced during the study period. PM2.5, PM10, and NO2 are reduced by ~37 (μg/m3), 62 (μg/m3), and 145 (μg/m3), respectively. A total of ~1310, ~401, and ~430 premature cause-specific deaths were estimated to be avoided with the reduction of NO2, PM2.5, and PM10. The total economic benefits (Billion US$) (sum of 20 cities) of the avoided mortality are measured as ~10, ~3.1, and ~3.3 for NO2, PM2.5, and PM10, respectively. In many cases, ground monitored data was found inadequate for detailed spatial assessment. This problem can be better addressed by incorporating satellite data into the evaluation if proper quality assurance is achieved, and the data processing burden can be alleviated or even removed. Both satellite and ground-based estimates suggest the positive effect of the limited human interference on the natural environments. Further research in this direction is needed to explore this synergistic association more explicitly. © 2021 The Author(s)","Air pollution; COVID-19; Google Earth Engine; Human mobility; Lockdown; TROPOMI","carbon monoxide; nitric oxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; volatile organic compound; air quality; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; COVID-19; particulate matter; public health; remote sensing; satellite data; urban area; air monitoring; air pollution; air quality; anthropogenic emission; Article; cause of death; city; clinical evaluation; coronavirus disease 2019; data processing; exhaust gas; health economics; human; lockdown; mortality rate; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; public health; quality control; scanning imaging absorption spectrometry; software; spatial analysis; spectroscopy; surface property; time series analysis; air pollutant; air pollution; city; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102310716

Location: Mediterranean and Macaronesian. Taxon: Cupressaceae, Juniperus. Methods: Data on the occurrence of the J. phoenicea complex were obtained from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF.org), the literature, herbaria, and the authors’ field notes. Bioclimatic variables were obtained from the WorldClim database and Paleoclim. The climate data related to species localities were used for predictions of niches by implementation of Maxent, and the model was evaluated with ENMeval. Results: The potential niches of Juniperus phoenicea during the Last Interglacial period (LIG), Last Glacial Maximum climate (LGM), and Mid-Holocene (MH) covered 30%, 10%, and almost 100%, respectively, of the current potential niche. Climate warming may reduce potential niches by 30% in RCP2.6 and by 90% in RCP8.5. The potential niches of Juniperus turbinata had a broad circum-Mediterranean and Canarian distribution during the LIG and the MH; its distribution extended during the LGM when it was found in more areas than at present. The predicted warming in scenarios RCP2.6 and RCP8.5 could reduce the current potential niche by 30% and 50%, respectively. The model did not find suitable niches for J. canariensis during the LIG and the LGM, but during the MH its potential niche was 30% larger than at present. The climate warming scenario RCP2.6 indicates a reduction in the potential niche by 30%, while RCP8.5 so indicates a reduction of almost 60%. Main conclusions: This research can provide information for increasing the protection of the juniper forest and for counteracting the phenomenon of local extinctions caused by anthropic pressure and climate changes. © 2021 The Authors.

Thus, an efficient approach for maximizing polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) polymer production in methanotrophic bacteria has been developed using the methane gas produced in the anaerobic digestion process in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPS) as a carbon substrate and an electron donor. A comparison study was conducted between two experimental setups using two different recycling strategies, namely new and conventional setups. The former setup aims to recycle PHB producers into the system after the PHB accumulation phase, while the latter recycles the biomass back into the system after the exponential phase of growth or the growth phase. The goal of this study was to compare both setups in terms of PHB production and other operational parameters such as growth rate, methane uptake rate, and biomass yield using two different nitrogen sources, namely nitrate and ammonia. The newly proposed setup is aimed at stimulating PHB accumulating type II methanotroph growth whilst enabling other PHB accumulators to grow simultaneously. The success of the proposed method was confirmed as it achieved highest recorded PHB accumulation percentages for a mixed culture community in both ammonia-and nitrate-enriched media of 59.4% and 54.3%, respectively, compared to 37.8% and 9.1% for the conventional setup. Finally, the sequencing of microbial samples showed a significant increase in the abundance of type II methanotrophs along with other PHB producers, confirming the success of the newly proposed technique in screening for PHB producers and achieving higher PHB accumulation. © 2021 by the authors.

This scenario requires developing specific flooding vulnerability mitigation strategies that improve local knowledge of flood-prone areas at the urban scale and supersede the traditional hazard approach based on the classification of riverine buffers. Moreover, decision-makers need to adopt performance-based strategies for contrasting climate changes and increasing the resilience of the system. This research develops the recent Flooding Risk Mitigation model of InVEST (Integrated Evaluation of Ecosystem Services and Trade-off), where cloudburst vulnerability results from the soil’s hydrological conductivity. It is based on the assumption that during cloudburst events, all saturated soils have the potential for flooding, regardless of the distance to rivers or channels, causing damage and, in the worst cases, victims. The model’s output gives the run-off retention index evaluated in the catchment area of Turin (Italy) and its neighborhoods. We evaluated the outcome to gain specific insight into potential land use adaptation strategies. The index is the first experimental biophysical assessment developed in this area, and it could prove useful in the revision process of the general town plan underway. © 2021 by the authors.

In this sense, this study investigates the developing process of parametric modeling and optimization of a naturally ventilated house located in a region with well-defined seasons. Its purpose is to improve its thermal comfort during the cooling period by maximizing Natural Ventilation Effectiveness (NVE) and diminishing annual building energy demand, namely Total Cooling Loads (TCL) and Total Heating Loads (THL). Following a structured workflow, divided into (i) model setting, (ii) Sensitivity Analyses (SA), and (iii) Multiobjective Optimization (MOO), the process is straightforwardly implemented through a 3D parametric modeling platform. After building set up, the input variables number is firstly reduced with SA, and the last step runs with an innovative model-based optimization algorithm (RBFOpt), particularly appropriate for time-intensive performance simulations. The impact of design variables on the three-performance metrics is comprehensively discussed, with a direct relationship between NVE and TCL. MOO results indicate a great potential for natural ventilation and heating energy savings for the residential building set as a reference, showing an improvement between 14–87% and 26–34% for NVE and THL, respectively. The approach meets the current environmental demands related to reducing energy consumption and CO2 emissions, which include passive design implementations, such as natural or hybrid ventilation. Moreover, the design solutions and building orientation, window-to-wall ratio, and envelope properties could be used as guidance in similar typologies and climates. Finally, the adopted framework configures a practical and replicable approach for studies aiming to develop high-performance buildings through MOO. © 2021 by the authors.

Despite their ecological and historical value, terrace cultivation is threatened by climate change leading to abandonment and further marginalization of arable land imposing serious environmental and community hazards. Re-cultivation of terraced landscapes could be an alternative strategy to mitigate the climate change impacts in areas of high vulnerability encouraging a sustainable agroecosystem to ensure food security, rural development and restrain land desertification. The article presents the case study of abandoned terrace re-cultivation in the Aegean Island of Andros, using a climate smart agriculture system, which involves the establishment of an extensive meteorological network to monitor the local climate and hydrometeorological forecasting. Along with terrace site mapping and soil pro-filing the perfomance of cereal and legume crops was assessed in a low-input agriculture system. The implementation of a land stewardship (LS) plan was indispensable to overcome mainly land fragmentation issues and to transfer know-how. It was found that climate data are key drivers for crop cultivation and production in the island rainfed farming system. The study revealed that terrace soil quality could be improved through cultivation to support food safety and stall land degradation. In line with global studies this research suggest that cultivation of marginal terraced land is timely through a climate smart agriculture system as a holistic approach to improve land quality and serve as means to combat climate change impacts.

No longer in operation, many wells are now classified as abandoned, and, due to their age, their locations are either unknown or inaccurately recorded. These historic-well sites present environmental, safety, and economic concerns in the form of possible methane leaks and physical hazards. Airborne magnetic and LiDAR surveys were conducted in the Pioneer Run watershed in Oil Creek State Park to find abandoned wells in a historically significant but physically challenging location. Wells were drilled in this area prior to modern geolocation and legal documentation. Although a large number of old wells were abandoned summarily without remediation of the site, much of the land area within Oil Creek State Park is now covered in trees and dense underbrush, which can obscure wellheads. The thick vegetation and steep terrain limited the possibility of ground-based surveys to easily find well sites for methane emissions studies. The data from remote sensing surveys were used to corroborate potential well locations from historic maps and photographs. Potential well sites were verified in a ground-based field survey and monitored for methane emissions. Two historic photographs documenting oil activity in the late 1800s were georeferenced using a combination of magnetic and LiDAR data. LiDAR data, which were more useful in georeferencing and in field verification, identified 290 field locations in the Pioneer Run watershed, 86% of which were possible well sites. Sixty-two percent of the ground-verified wells remained unplugged and comprised the majority of leaking wells. The mean methane emissions factor for unplugged wells was 0.027 ± 0.099 kg/day, lower than other Appalachian Basin methane emissions estimates. LiDAR was used for the first time, in combination with an airborne magnetic survey, to reveal underground oil industry features and inform well identification and remediation efforts in difficult-to-navigate regions. In the oldest oil fields, where well casing has been removed or wood conductor casing was installed, historic photographs provide additional lines of evidence for oil wells where ground disturbances have concealed surface features. Identification of well sites is necessary for mitigation efforts, as unplugged wells emit methane, a potent greenhouse gas. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Abandoned wells; Greenhouse gases; Historical photos; LiDAR; Magnetometry; Methane; Oil and natural gas","Abandoned wells; Discovery wells; Greenhouse gases; Infill drilling; Location; Magnetism; Methane; Oil fields; Oil well casings; Optical radar; Photography; Remote sensing; Surveys; Watersheds; Wellheads; Airborne magnetic surveys; Appalachian basin; Economic concerns; Legal documentation; Methane emissions; Oil activities; Potential wells; Surface feature; Oil well drilling; methane; well water; abandoned mine; emission; field survey; ground-based measurement; historical perspective; lidar; methane; mitigation; oil well; remote sensing; satellite data; watershed; well; wellhead; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; geographic mapping; greenhouse effect; magnetometry; offshore oil industry; oil and gas field; oil industry; Pennsylvania; photography; remote sensing; surface property; tar sand; watershed management; oil and gas field; United States; Appalachian Basin; Pennsylvania; United States; Appalachian Region; Methane; Oil and Gas Fields; Pennsylvania; Water Wells",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099806851

The major factor that determines Beijing’s climate policy is the prevailing and potential climate change impact on the country’s economic development. As economic development is the foremost, pre-existing and abiding political concern, political leaders construct the climate change impact as a major threat to the country’s economic prosperity. Thus, political leaders’ overriding priority is to protect economic development—a referent object—from the perils of climate change. However, the interplay of climate threat and economic development drives political leaders to embrace security institution and develop military mind set to contend with climate-led development policies that trigger the securitisation of the development process in China.

Growing evidence from various ecosystems contradicts this expectation, showing nocturnal soil CO2 influx. Little is known about this puzzling phenomenon and the underlying mechanisms governing it. We attempted to bridge this knowledge gap by proposing the “dryland carbon influx” (DCI) framework. Based on Henry's law, decreases in soil temperature stimulate CO2 dissolution in soil solutions, creating a CO2 concentration gradient between soil air and the atmosphere. This may lead to CO2 diffusion from the atmosphere into the soil. This influx is expected to be stronger at lower temperatures, high soil to atmosphere temperature gradients, and in CaCO3 rich alkaline soils that characterize drylands. The soil abiotic influx is expected to govern the overall CO2 flux when dry conditions and low soil organic matter limit organismal respiration. We examined the underlying conditions predicted by the DCI framework using a literature review and soil CO2 flux measurements from the Negev Desert. We found 24 studies that reported dark soil CO2 influx, almost exclusively from drylands. CO2 influx was recorded mainly in alkaline soils, was positively correlated with pH levels, and was associated predominantly with low soil temperature, decreasing soil temperature or a positive soil to air thermal gradient. CO2 influx was found not only in dry soils but also in poor organic content wet soils. In the Negev Desert, CO2 influx occurred only when (a) soil temperature was higher than air temperature and was decreasing, and (b) soil moisture was 7.76% or lower. Only above this threshold, a positive association between CO2 efflux and microbial biomass was found. Our results largely support the DCI framework, suggesting that soil CO2 influx is prevalent across drylands worldwide, facilitated by the edaphic and climatic conditions that induce abiotic CO2 exchange and restrain biotic respiration. Considering the abiotic contribution to soil CO2 flux, and determining the conditions that regulate it may substantially improve our carbon budget calculations, and estimations of soil biotic respiration. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Abiotic soil CO2 flux; Arid; Carbon uptake; Carbonates; Deserts; Soil CO2 influx; Soil respiration","Alkalinity; Arid regions; Atmospheric temperature; Budget control; Calcite; Calcium carbonate; Ecosystems; Landforms; Soil moisture; Thermal gradients; Abiotic soil CO2 flux; Alkaline soils; Arid; Carbon uptake; Condition; Dryland; Soil CO; Soil CO2 influx; Soil respiration; Soil temperature; Carbon dioxide; biomass; carbon flux; climate conditions; conceptual framework; empirical analysis; soil emission; soil respiration; Israel; Negev; Southern District",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102753621

The initiation and propagation of the cracks in the carbon anode, especially the horizontal cracks below the stub-holes, reduce the anode efficiency during the electrolysis process. The failure analysis of coke aggregates can be employed to determine the appropriate recipe and operating conditions in order to avoid the formation of cracks in the carbon anodes. In this paper, it will be shown that a particular failure mode can be responsible for the crack generation in the carbon anodes. The second-order work criterion is employed to analyze the failure of the coke aggregate specimens and the relationships between the second-order work, the kinetic energy, and the instability of the granular material are investigated. In addition, the coke aggregates are modeled by exploiting the discrete element method (DEM) to reveal the micro-mechanical behavior of the dry coke aggregates during the compaction process. The optimal number of particles required for the failure analysis in the DEM simulations is determined. The effects of the confining pressure and strain rate as two important compaction process parameters on the failure are studied. The results reveal that increasing the confining pressure enhances the probability of the diffusing mode of the failure in the specimen. On the other hand, the increase of strain rate augments the chance of the strain localization mode of the failure in the specimen. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to such an extended period of lockdown for about more than 2 months resulted in 1.38 billion populations restricted themselves from mass activities that contribute to air pollution. Thus, through our quantitative approach and trend analysis, the study aims to evaluate the changes in the level of PM2.5 as a major pollutant for the top ten polluted cities in India, with a special emphasis on finding what happened to its concentration after the lockdown ended. Thus, to better understand the nature of variation in PM2.5, we divide the entire 7 months into three periods for our analysis, i.e., before lockdown (1 January to 24 March), during lockdown (25 March to 31 May), and post-lockdown or unlock 1 and 2 (1 June to 31 July). Our investigation reveals that before lockdown, all the top polluted cities of India violating the national standard of PM2.5, as the lockdown begins interestingly, all cities show a momentous reduction in PM2.5 concentration. Further, surprisingly we found that after the post-lockdown period, the concentration of PM2.5 was reduced to minimal, as the average concentration of PM2.5 for all the cities is below the National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS). The study reveals that the lockdown has a consequence in improving overall air quality for the top polluted cities in India and further lockdown in the future with proper planning should be considered an alternative approach to restrain excessive emissions. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Air pollution; COVID-19; India; Lockdown; PM2.5","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; particulate matter; standard (regulation); India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099256548

For the present study, cows were housed in an environmental chamber from which waste was removed by either flushing or scraping at two different frequencies. The four treatments used were (1) flushing three times a day (F3), (2) flushing six times a day (F6), (3) scraping three times a day (S3), and (4) scraping six times a day (S6). Flushing freestall lanes to remove manure while cows are out of the barn during milking is an industry standard in California. Gas emissions were measured with a mobile agricultural air quality lab connected to the environmental chamber. Ammonia and hydrogen sulfide (H2S) emissions were decreased (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.05) in the flushing vs. scraping treatments, respectively. Scraping increased NH3 emissions by 175 and 152% for S3 and S6, respectively vs. F3. Ethanol (EtOH) emissions were increased (p &lt; 0.001) when the frequency of either scraping or flushing was increased from 3 to 6 times but were similar between scraping and flushing treatments. Methane emissions for the F3 vs. other treatments, were decreased (p &lt; 0.001).

To restrict urban expansion in the outskirts, a common strategy is to densify existing neighbourhoods. Densification implies the increase of water impervious area which increases the vulnerability to flooding during extreme precipitation events. Sustainable urban drainage systems are considered as a strategy to handle stormwater runoff locally and thus relieve the sewage system. This study investigates the combined quantitative hydrological impact of densification and sustainable stormwater management measures in a residential neighbourhood in Munich, Germany. The living-lab approach pursues the application of nature-based solutions in a real planning case to achieve positive climate effects while densifying the neighbourhood. The study is based on single event simulations of three return periods with the physically based software PCSWMM. The events are implemented for both current and climate change precipitation intensities of the RCP 8.5 projection for 2040–2069. Three scenarios are implemented: a status quo, a business as usual scenario (additional buildings without compensation measures) and a best-case scenario (one additional floor with green roofs disconnected from the sewers in combination with rain gardens and porous pavements on the land parcels). The comparison between the different scenarios focuses on three main aspects of the water balance, namely, infiltration, runoff and storage. The results show that measures for sustainable stormwater management are crucial elements to cope with an increasing number of heavy precipitation events due to climate change. The best-case scenario significantly outperforms the other two concerning water infiltration, surface runoff and storage. Most notably is the impact of climate change projection rainfall intensities for 2040–2069. The outcomes for these intensities clearly show the positive impact of sustainable water-sensitive design. The results demonstrate that it is in fact possible to enhance the water balance and gain new living space simultaneously if a sustainable urban planning strategy is implemented that includes future-oriented stormwater management. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Blue green infrastructure; Low impact development; Nature-based solutions; Sewer system; Sustainable urban drainage system; SWMM; Urban climate adaptation","Densification; Drainage; Infiltration; Rain; Runoff; Sewage; Storm sewers; Storms; Water conservation; Water management; Blue green infrastructure; Densifications; Living spaces; Low impact development; Nature-based solution; Sewer system; Stormwater managements; Sustainable urban drainage systems; SWMM; Urban climate adaptation; Climate change; climate change; intermediate water; neighborhood; precipitation (climatology); rainfall; runoff; spatiotemporal analysis; stormwater; sustainability; urban drainage; water management; Bavaria; Germany; Munich",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102250553

The protein yields 93% of ethylene (C2H4), implying a C-C coupling step that mandates the simultaneous binding of two CO at the active site FeV cofactor. Spectroscopic data indicated multiple CO binding events, but structural analyses of Mo and V nitrogenase only confirmed a single site. Here, we report the structure of a two CO-bound state of V nitrogenase at 1.05 Å resolution, with one μ-bridging and one terminal CO molecule. This additional, specific ligand binding site suggests a mechanistic route for CO reduction and hydrocarbon formation, as well as a second access pathway for protons required during the reaction.

In particular, the Canadian provinces of Quebec and Ontario as well as the states of the northeastern United States have committed to cut their greenhouse emissions by more than 70% (with respect to emission levels of 1990). Increased collaboration and integration between jurisdictions could decrease such decarbonization costs, especially when important hydropower resources are available. Using a capacity expansion and dispatch model of the Northeastern North American electricity sector, we analyze the impact of emission reduction targets, load levels and availability of power technologies in a range of scenarios, in order to assess the benefits of regional cooperation. Our results show that for deep decarbonization, the electricity system costs can be significantly reduced through integration, especially by adding more interconnection capacity. These costs savings and benefits are however not evenly allocated between jurisdictions, creating potentially difficult collaboration incentives. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonization; Electricity sector integration; Hydropower; Northeastern North America","Decarbonization; Electric industry; Emission control; Hydroelectric power; Hydroelectric power plants; Integration; Power markets; Capacity expansion; Electricity sector; Emission reduction targets; Greenhouse emissions; Hydro-power resources; Interconnection capacity; Power technologies; Regional cooperation; Electric power system interconnection; cost-benefit analysis; economic integration; electricity generation; emission control; energy market; environmental economics; greenhouse gas; hydroelectric power plant; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102009048

Recently, CO2-triggered BOLD MRI has been shown to be a promising tool for the hemodynamic evaluation of moyamoya patients. However, the longitudinal reliability of this technique in follow-up examinations is unknown. This study aims to analyze longitudinal follow-up data of CO2-triggered BOLD MRI to prove the reliability of this technique for long-term control examinations in moyamoya patients. Methods: Longitudinal CO2 BOLD MRI follow-up examinations of moyamoya patients with and without surgical revascularization have been analyzed for all 6 vascular territories retrospectively. If revascularization was performed, any directly (by the disease or the bypass) or indirectly (due to change of collateral flow after revascularization) affected territory was excluded based on angiography findings (group 1). In patients without surgical revascularization between the MRI examinations, all territories were analyzed (group 2). Results: Eighteen moyamoya patients with 39 CO2 BOLD MRI examinations fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The median follow-up between the 2 examinations was 12 months (range 4-29 months). For 106 vascular territories analyzed in group 1, the intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.784, p < 0.001, and for group 2 (84 territories), it was 0.899, p < 0.001. Within the total follow-up duration of 140 patient months, none of the patients experienced a new stroke. Conclusions: CO2 BOLD MRI is a promising tool for mid- and long-term follow-up examinations of cerebral hemodynamics in moyamoya patients. Systematic prospective evaluation is required prior to making it a routine examination. © 2021 The Author(s). Published by S.

Design: Life cycle assessment was used to determine environmental impacts of PPE distributed to health and social care in England during the first six months of the COVID-19 pandemic. The base scenario assumed all products were single-use and disposed of via clinical waste. Scenario modelling was used to determine the effect of environmental mitigation strategies: (1) eliminating international travel during supply; (2) eliminating glove use; (3) reusing gowns and face shields; and (4) maximal recycling. Setting: Royal Sussex County Hospital, Brighton, UK. Main outcome measures: The carbon footprint of PPE distributed during the study period totalled 106,478 tonnes CO2e, with greatest contributions from gloves, aprons, face shields and Type IIR surgical masks. The estimated damage to human health was 239 DALYs (disability-adjusted life years), impact on ecosystems was 0.47 species.year (loss of local species per year), and impact on resource depletion was costed at US $12.7m (GBP £9.3m). Scenario modelling indicated UK manufacture would have reduced the carbon footprint by 12%, eliminating gloves by 45%, reusing gowns and gloves by 10% and maximal recycling by 35%. Results: A combination of strategies may have reduced the carbon footprint by 75% compared with the base scenario, and saved an estimated 183 DALYS, 0.34 species.year and US $7.4m (GBP £5.4m) due to resource depletion. Conclusion: The environmental impact of PPE is large and could be reduced through domestic manufacture, rationalising glove use, using reusables where possible and optimising waste management. © 2021, The Royal Society of Medicine.","Environmental issues; health policy; public health","ozone; Article; carbon footprint; coronavirus disease 2019; disability-adjusted life year; England; environmental impact; health care cost; health hazard; health service; hospital waste; human; life cycle assessment; pandemic; recycling; resource allocation; risk evaluation and mitigation strategy; social work; United Kingdom; waste disposal; environment; epidemiology; health care personnel; prevention and control; protective equipment; social support; COVID-19; England; Environment; Health Personnel; Humans; Medical Waste Disposal; Personal Protective Equipment; Social Support",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102703063

Among these, most are in humid climates, while very few data exist for semi-arid and sub-humid climates, due to the difficulty of estimating hydro-geochemical balances in catchments with ephemeral streams. We contribute to fill this gap by presenting a meteorological and hydro-geochemical dataset acquired at the Mule Hole catchment (4.1 km2), a pristine dry deciduous forest located in a biosphere reserve in south India. The dataset consists of time series of variables related to (i) meteorology, including rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and direction, and global radiation, (ii) hydrology, including water level and discharge at the catchment outlet, (iii) hydrogeology, including manual (monthly) and/or automated (from 15 min to hourly) groundwater levels in nine piezometers and (iv) geochemistry, including suspended sediment content in the stream and chemical composition of rainfall (event based), groundwater (monthly sampling) and stream water (storm events, 15 min to hourly frequency with an automatic sampler). The time series extend from 2003 to 2019. Measurement errors are minimized by frequent calibration of sensors and quality checks, both in the field and in the laboratory. Despite these precautions, several data gaps exist, due to occasional access restriction to the site and instrument destruction by wildlife. Results show that large seasonal and interannual variations of climatic conditions were reflected in the large variations of stream flow and groundwater recharge, as well as in water chemical composition. Notably, they reveal a long-term evolution of groundwater storage, suggesting hydrogeological cycles on a decadal scale. This dataset, alone or in combination with other data, has already allowed to better understand water and element cycling in tropical dry forests, and the role of forest diversity on biogeochemical cycles. As tropical ecosystems are underrepresented by Critical Zone Observatories, we expect this data note to be valuable for the global scientific community. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","dry forest; groundwater level; meteorology; south India; stream flow; suspended sediment; tropics; water chemistry; weathering","Atmospheric radiation; Biodiversity; Biogeochemistry; Catchments; Data streams; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Forestry; Groundwater geochemistry; Hydrochemistry; Hydrogeology; Long Term Evolution (LTE); Observatories; Plants (botany); Rain; Rivers; Runoff; Stream flow; Suspended sediments; Time series; Tropics; Water conservation; Water levels; Wind; Chemical compositions; Dry deciduous forests; Geochemical monitoring; Ground water recharge; Hydrogeological cycle; Scientific community; Seasonal and interannual variations; Wind speed and directions; Recharging (underground waters); chemical weathering; data set; dry forest; groundwater; humid tropics; meteorology; monitoring; observatory; streamflow; suspended sediment; water chemistry; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106867273

This research focused on an easy and worldwide accessible classification of sugarcane residue as materials for civil construction. The residues were collected from a sugar mill and categorized in bagasse fiber (BF), sand (BS), and ash (BA). The physical and mechanical properties of the BF and the chemical composition of the BA were studied. Afterward, mortar specimens were prepared to obtain the flexural strength. Finally, an environmental assessment was made. This study revealed that the residues of sugarcane in Okinawa are viable to use as material in civil construction since the flexural strength of the mortar added with residues increased when compared with the control mortar, even with the presence of reducing sugars. In addition, with the use of sugarcane residues in mortar, it was possible to decrease the CO2 emissions, reducing around 8% the environmental load. © 2021, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.","CO2 reduction; Flexural strength; Mortar; Reducing sugar; Sugarcane bagasse ash; Sugarcane bagasse fibers","Bending strength; Sugar factories; Chemical compositions; Civil constructions; Environmental assessment; Environmental loads; Mortar specimens; Physical and mechanical properties; Resource extraction; Sugarcane residues; Mortar",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102337497

Tropical-species plantations have been established in western Mexico, but their content and distribution of biomass and carbon storage are unknown. In this study, the content and distribution of aerial biomass and carbon storage of the native species Enterolobium cyclocarpum and Tabebuia rosea, and the exotic species Gmelina arborea and Tectona grandis in 12-year plantations in the state of Jalisco were estimated. Also, the relation between aerial biomass and normal diameter was adjusted with linear, potential, and polynomial models. In the four species, most of the proportion of aerial biomass (58-67 %) was found in the stem. The normal diameter was confirmed as a good predictor of total aerial biomass since two species were adjusted to potential models, and two were adjusted to polynomial models, with which it is possible to estimate aerial biomass fast, easily, and at lower cost than with the destructive method. T. grandis, G. arborea, and E. cyclocarpum were the species with the greatest biomass (161 kg ha-1, 134 kg ha-1 and 130 kg ha-1) and carbon storage potential (144.6 Mg ha-1, 120.8 Mg ha-1 and 117.5 Mg ha-1).

In the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region, the contradiction between preserving the ecological environment and facilitating sustainable economic development is particularly acute. This study analyzed the spatiotemporal evolution of water pollutants and their factors of influence using statistics on the discharge of two water pollutants, namely chemical oxygen demand (COD) and NH3-N (ammonia nitrogen), in 154 counties in both 2012 and 2016 as research units in the region. The study employed Exploratory Spatial-Time Data Analysis (ESTDA), Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE), and the Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) models, as well as ArcGIS and GeoDa software, obtaining the following conclusions: (1) From 2012 to 2016, pollutant discharge dropped significantly, with COD and NH3-N emissions decreasing 65.9% and 47.2%, respectively; the pollutant emissions possessed the spatial feature of gradual gradient descent from the central districts to the periph-ery. (2) The water pollutants discharge displayed significant and positive spatial correlations. The spatiotemporal cohesion of the spatiotemporal evolution of the pollutants was higher than their spa-tiotemporal fluidity, representing strong spatial locking. (3) The level of economic development, the level of urbanization, and the intensity of agricultural production input significantly and positively drove pollutant discharge; the environmental regulations had a significant effect on reducing the emission of pollutants. In particular, the effect for NH3-N emissions reduction was stronger; the driving effect of the industrial structure and the distance decay was not significant. © 2021 by the authors.

The food waste problem is well characterized, but solutions are not: there has been little rigorous comparison of the costs and potential benefits of food waste reduction interventions. Food waste reduction is often described as a “win–win,” benefiting consumers, the environment, and businesses’ bottom line. We present a method for evaluating this claim by accounting for the costs and environmental benefits of food waste reduction. The procedure involves assembling data on costs and efficacy of the intervention, scaling the costs up to the national level, estimating the quantity and value of food waste averted, and finally estimating the potential averted environmental impact. We apply our method to four representative nationwide interventions: consumer education and public awareness campaigns, spoilage prevention packaging for produce and meat, standardization of date labels, and foodservice waste tracking systems. The estimated annual cost of each intervention varied from $126 to $595 million. The environmental cost-effectiveness of the interventions varied two- to threefold (for example, 6 to 16 kg CO2 reduced per $1 invested). Outstanding questions include how to scale interventions to the national level and how to address the mismatch between who incurs the costs of implementation and who benefits. Our method can be adapted to waste interventions across the food system and in countries beyond the United States. © 2021","Consumer education; Cost-effectiveness; Date labeling; Food waste; Packaging; Waste tracking","Cost effectiveness; Cost estimating; Food waste; Consumer education; Environmental benefits; Environmental costs; National level; Potential benefits; Public awareness campaign; Waste reduction; Waste tracking system; Cost reduction; carbon dioxide; cost-benefit analysis; education; environmental impact; food waste; packaging waste; waste management; accounting; Article; awareness; consumer; cost benefit analysis; cost effectiveness analysis; data processing; education; environmental impact; food packaging; food spoilage; food waste; meat; public health campaign; standardization; United States; waste management; United States; Trixis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100277034

The impact was studied for pre-lockdown (1st Mar–24th Mar 2020), lockdown (25th Mar–31st May 2020), and unlocking (1st Jun–31st Aug 2020) phases. The lockdown period comprises 4 lockdown phases with distinct measures, whereas the unlocking period had 3 phases. PM2.5 concentration reduced significantly in all megacities and met the national standards during the lockdown period. The maximum reduction in PM2.5 level was observed in Kolkata (62%), followed by Mumbai (49%), Chennai (34%), and New Delhi (26%) during the lockdown period. Comparatively, Hyderabad exhibited a smaller reduction in PM2.5 concentration, i.e., 10%. The average PM2.5 levels during the lockdown in the peak hour (i.e., 07:00−11:00 h) in New Delhi, Chennai, Kolkata, Mumbai, and Hyderabad decreased by 21.3%, 48.5%, 63.4%, 56.4%, and 23.8%, respectively, compared to those before lockdown period. During the unlocking period, except for Chennai, all megacities showed a reduction in average PM2.5 levels compared to concentrations in the lockdown period, but these reductions were mainly linked with monsoon rains in India. The current study provided an opportunity to study air pollution in the absence of major anthropogenic activities and during limited activities in monsoon season having an ecological design. The study reports a new baseline of PM2.5, except for monsoon, and explores this knowledge to plan future air pollution reduction strategies. The study also discusses how this new learning of knowledge could strengthen air pollution control policies for better air quality and sustainability.

For member states of the European Union (EU), challenges include rapidly rising global demand and competition for energy resources from countries such as China and India, tensions with Russia, efforts to integrate the EU's internal energy market, and a growing need to shift fuels in keeping with the EU's climate change policy goals. As a result, energy supply security has become a key concern for the EU. European energy security is also of significant interest to the United States. While energy policy in the EU has long been a strongly guarded competence of national governments, the EU's role in energy policy has expanded over the last few decades. An important element of the EU's energy supply strategy has been to shift to a greater use of natural gas and renewables and to move away from nuclear and coal. Russia is the most important of the EU's natural gas suppliers, holding the top spot since 2014. The EU's natural gas consumption is projected to grow as EU member states' natural gas production continues to decline. If trends continue as projected, dependence on Russia as a supplier is likely to grow. Although some countries in the EU are exploring alternative sources for their natural gas needs, it is uncertain whether the EU as a whole can, or is willing to, replace a significant level of imports from Russia. Some EU member states that feel vulnerable to Russian energy supply manipulation are working hard to achieve supply diversification and energy sector integration. Meanwhile, Russia has sought to protect its share of the EU natural gas market. It has attempted to stymie European-backed alternatives by proposing competing pipeline projects and attempting to increase its influence with European companies by offering them stakes in these and other projects. Successive U.S. Administrations and Congresses have viewed European energy security as a U.S. national interest. In recent years, promoting diversification of EU natural gas supplies has been a focal point of U.S. energy policy in Europe and Eurasia. The Trump Administration has opposed new Russian gas projects as tools to maintain EU dependence on Russia. At the end of 2019, Congress passed the FY2020 National Defense Authorization Act (P.L. 116-92), which included sanctions related to the construction of the Nord Stream 2 and TurkStream pipelines. The Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2020 (P.L. 116-94) includes the European Energy Security and Diversification Act of 2019, which seeks to promote the diversification of Central and East European energy sources and supply routes. Although the United States and the EU have sought to promote the export of piped natural gas from the Caspian Region and liquefied natural gas (LNG) from the United States, this is not being achieved in volumes sufficient to counter Russian exports. Regions such as North Africa and the Eastern Mediterranean have potential as alternative suppliers but are constrained in their ability to increase exports. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110330215

However, the cloud passages always lead to the suddenly varied heat input to the system, while understanding the system's response to the cloud disturbance may enable the operational stability which is viable for driving the advanced CO2-TRC system. In this study, a dynamic thermodynamics model is developed to simulate the response behaviors of the simple and regenerative CO2-TRC based trough CSP systems under various cloud disturbances. The results show that by examining the system's performances, the cloud thickness mainly affects the variation range, while the cloud cover duration mainly affects recovery time. At the same cloud thickness, the recovery time for the regenerative system could be about three times longer than that for the simple system. Subject to the cloud with same cover duration, the simple system tends to reach the stable state in the shorter time. As the collector is shaded by a moving cloud, the system's recovery time is almost same but the system efficiency has the smaller decrease as compared to the stationary cloud coverage with the same duration. These results allow determining the optimal design and operating scheme of the CO2-TRC based CSP systems to increase the output power and operating stability. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cloud disturbance; CO2 transcritical Rankine cycle; Dynamic simulation; Parabolic trough concentrating solar power","Carbon dioxide; Collector efficiency; Rankine cycle; Recovery; System stability; Compact structures; Concentrating solar power; Medium temperature; Operating stability; Operational stability; Regenerative system; System's performance; Thermodynamics model; Solar power plants",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101400614

Specifically, under a community-led PES, forest conservation is promoted to deliver carbon and stream water benefits. The upstream community is paid for avoided fuelwood harvesting through a United Nations programme on reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD) program, whereas additional income is generated from water sales to the downstream communities. A bio-economic model derives optimal level of fuelwood harvesting, which in conjunction with the changing species composition of forests, streamflow hydrology and fire risks, impacts on the carbon and water generation potential of the PES project. Results indicate that forest conservation outcomes are better when water and carbon services are combined, however overall cost to the program is lower under a carbon-based PES. Changing species composition of forests creates tradeoffs between water and carbon benefits. Forest fires further challenge the viability of PES schemes through reducing streamflow and carbon sequestration potential. Recommendations for Resource Managers: Linking two or more environmental services under a single payment for ecosystem services (PES) scheme could improve forest conservation through making it more attractive to the participating communities. PES programs that combine multiple environmental services become economically attractive to participating communities through increasing their incomes. For instance, water and carbon driven services complement each other due to the overlapping benefits from improving forest biomass. However, fire risks can lower the benefits from PES and dissuade community participation. Similarly, the ecological and hydrological dimensions of PES projects that offer carbon and water benefits need to be understood and incorporated within PES framework design to enhance their durability. Conservation of mixed forests is more responsive to water-based PES payments, in comparison to monoculture oak forests, however, mixed forests are also more vulnerable to degradation in absence of cooking fuel subsidies. © 2021 The Authors.

The traditional focus has been on hydrocarbon exploration and production targets. These targets are commonly buried under a few kilometres of sedimentary layers and 3D seismic technology has been the main type of data acquired for characterizing these targets. A secondary focus has been on the shallow section, and it has mostly been driven by shallow hazard investigations to aid the drilling of those targets. This characterization is commonly done with 2D high-resolution seismic referred to as site surveys. In recent years, shallower targets have been sought for carbon capture and storage (CCS). It is best to store carbon dioxide in its critical state which is achieved at burial depths of about 800 m. Thus, the goal is to locate porous rocks with a natural seal at depths of 800 m-1500 m below the seabed. Deeper reservoirs can be used for CCS, but shallower ones are more economical. In addition, offshore mineral exploration is at the point of becoming a commercial activity. To characterize these mineral reservoirs or deposits, the selected type of data needs to resolve the very near surface (first few decametres) at a very high resolution in an efficient way that enables the location of targets with an area extension of 100 to 300 m. Thus, in 2021 3D seismic is aimed at best resolving the very shallow and the very deep. These facts motivated the set of experiments acquired in the AM20-lab in the Norwegian Atlantic Margin in 2020. In this paper, we focus on AM20-lab test 2. While the focus of test 2 is to achieve ultra-high resolution near-surface 3D seismic for mineral exploration, the data provides multipurpose value for medium and deep targets as well.

Among the evolutionary hypotheses, the 'out of the tropics' (OTT) hypothesis has received considerable attention. The OTT posits that the tropics are both a cradle and source of biodiversity for extratropical regions. To test the generality of the OTT hypothesis, we explored the spatial biodiversity dynamics of unicellular marine plankton over the Cenozoic era (the last 66 Myr). We find large-scale climatic changes during the Cenozoic shaped the diversification and dispersal of marine plankton. Origination was generally more likely in the extratropics and net dispersal was towards the tropics rather than in the opposite direction, especially during the warmer climates of the early Cenozoic. Although migration proportions varied among major plankton groups and climate phases, we provide evidence that the extratropics were a source of tropical microplankton biodiversity over the last 66 Myr. © 2021 The Author(s).","biodiversity; biogeography; climate change; macroevolution; marine plankton","Cenozoic; evolution; extratropical environment; latitudinal gradient; marine environment; plankton; biodiversity; climate; plankton; Biodiversity; Climate; Plankton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105768695

This study employs comprehensive data obtained in 2018 from 4351 farm households in five countries to appraise the key climate hazards experienced by farmers, the risk coping methods adopted, and factor influencing the use of these methods. Although droughts, floods, hailstorms, and crop pests/diseases are major climate-induced risks in ESA, droughts are predominant in all these countries. Farm households in ESA have adopted various strategies to address climate risk, which includes changing farming practices, reducing consumption, using savings and borrowing, and seeking new employment. Farming families headed by a female, married, or an elderly member opt to change farming methods and decrease consumption, whereas they are less inclined to look for alternate livelihood options. Farming families with higher livestock endowments commonly use savings or borrow and are unlikely to change farming methods, decrease consumption, and search for alternate employment. Better-off families tend to change farming methods but are unlikely to adopt other risk coping options. Farming families with non-farm livelihood options are unlikely to change farming methods, use savings/borrowings, or decrease consumption, whereas they tend to search for alternate employment. Training on agriculture and economic status are crucial for climate change adaptation in these regions. Findings exhibit substantial differences among the study countries regarding the adoption of coping strategies. Compared to farmers in Kenya, farmers in other countries change agricultural methods to cope with climate shocks. Ethiopian farmers, compared to their Kenyan counterparts, decrease consumption to deal with climate risks, whereas, farmers in Tanzania, Malawi, and Mozambique are less likely to use this option. Similarly, the likelihood of seeking alternative employment as a risk coping strategy is lower among Ethiopian farmers, while it is higher among the farmers in other countries. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate shock; Ex-post risk coping; Farm household; Sub-Saharan Africa","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Drought; Employment; Storms; Climate change adaptation; Climate hazards; Coping strategies; Economic status; Farming practices; Mozambique; Tanzania; Climate change; adaptive management; agricultural worker; catastrophic event; climate effect; coping strategy; farmers knowledge; strategic approach; Africa; aging; agricultural land; agricultural procedures; agricultural worker; Article; climate change; coping behavior; cost control; crop pest; drought; economic status; Ethiopia; flooding; household; human; ice storm; job finding; Kenya; livestock; Malawi; married person; Mozambique; priority journal; sex difference; Tanzania; Malawi; Mozambique; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099705928

Rapid environmental and climate change, including increasing sea-level rise, global warming, reduced upstream discharge and anthropogenic activities, are predicted to increase salinity in the mangroves, especially in the Bangladesh Sundarbans, thereby disrupting this blue carbon reservoir. Nevertheless, it remains unclear how salinity affects the belowground soil carbon despite the recognised effect on above ground productivity. To address this gap, research was undertaken in the Bangladesh Sundarbans to compare total soil organic carbon (SOC) across three salinity zones and to explore any potential predictive relationships with other physical, chemical properties and vegetation characteristics. Total SOC was significantly higher in the oligohaline zone (74.8 ± 14.9 Mg ha−1), followed by the mesohaline (59.3 ± 15.8 Mg ha−1), and polyhaline zone (48.3 ± 10.3 Mg ha−1) (ANOVA, F2, 500 = 118.9, p &lt; 0.001). At all sites, the topmost 10 cm of soil contained higher SOC density than the bottom depths (ANOVA, F3, 500 = 30.1, p &lt; 0.001). On average, Bruguiera sp. stand holds the maximum SOC measured, followed by two pioneer species Sonneratia apetala and Avicennia sp. Multiple regression results indicated that soil salinity, organic C:N and tree diameter were the best predictor for the variability of the SOC in the Sundarbans (R2 = 0.62). Despite lower carbon in the soil, the study highlights that the conservation priorities and low deforestation rate have led to less CO2 emissions than most sediment carbon-rich mangroves in the world. The study also emphasised the importance of spatial conservation planning to safeguard the soil carbon-rich zones in the Bangladesh Sundarbans from anthropogenic tourism and development activities to support climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Mangrove forest; Salinity zones; Soil depth; Soil organic carbon; The Sundarbans","carbon sequestration; climate change; deforestation; environmental change; forest ecosystem; global warming; human activity; mangrove; soil organic matter; spatial analysis; Bangladesh; Sundarbans; Avicennia; Bruguiera; Rhizophoraceae; Sonneratia apetala",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100083254

The substitution of traditional trucks in the last‐mile distribution by a UAV fleet can contribute to urban sustainability by reducing air pollution and increasing urban freight efficiency. This paper presents a novel approach to the joint proactive and reactive planning of deliveries by a UAV fleet. We develop a receding horizon‐based approach to reactive, online planning for the UAV fleet’s mission. We considered the delivery of goods to spatially dispersed customers over an assumed time horizon. Forecasted weather changes affect the energy consumption of UAVs and limit their range. Therefore, consideration should be given to plans for follow‐up tasks, previously unmet needs, and predictions of disturbances over a moving time horizon. We propose a set of reaction rules that can be encountered during delivery in a highly dynamic and unpredictable environment. We implement a constraint programming paradigm, which is well suited to cope with the nonlinearity of the system’s characteristics. The proposed approach to online reactive UAV routing is evaluated in several instances. The computational experiments have shown that the developed model is capable of providing feasible plans for a UAV fleet’s mission that are robust to changes in weather and customer’s orders. © 2021 by the authors.

Its use could contribute to achieving the recently updated national objectives for the generation of clean energy in the future National Energy and Climate Plan 2021–2030. Despite the different initiatives that were unsuccessfully proposed at the end of the 2000s, the current implementation of blue energy is practically zero in Spain due to the characteristics of the marine space, which limits the technical and economic viability of the projects. There are other factors, such as a complex regulatory framework, inadequate administrative processes, limited availability of information as well as social rejection of this type of facility. Like other Member States of the European Union, Spain is currently developing a process of maritime spatial planning (MSP) that should be concluded, according to RD 363/2017, with the approval of a maritime spatial plan (POEM) for each of the five existing marine demarcations. This planning will have consequences for the uses and activities of the marine environment, including marine renewable energies. It also provides an opportunity to address existing non-technical barriers and promote the deployment of blue energy facilities. This investigation studies the MSP landscape in Spain from a holistic perspective and analyzes the repercussions of future POEMs in the offshore wind sector and other marine renewable energies. It concludes by proposing a set of recommendations, based on previous experiences in other regions, aimed at facilitating the integration of clean energy policies in the future uses of this marine space. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Blue energy; Maritime spatial planning; Renewable energy; Spain","alternative energy; marine environment; policy implementation; power generation; regulatory framework; spatial planning; Spain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101078792

However, such an assumption can overestimate the actual environmental benefits because it incorrectly ignores the existence of rebound effects – increases in energy service usage. We provide the first empirical evidence of the grid impact of non-residential distributed solar energy and the associated reduced air emissions. Using consumer-level high frequency electricity consumption and solar panel installation data from Arizona, United States, we estimate the actual hourly reduction in electricity needed from the grid of commercial and industrial consumers through an econometric analysis. We show that this reduction is much smaller than the actual solar electricity generation. We also show that business distributed solar consumers create a further challenge to the utilities by not reducing their monthly maximum demand in July and August. Lastly, we calculate the benefit of reduced air emissions by multiplying the measured hourly reduction in electricity purchased from the grid by the marginal emission factors of CO2, SO2, NOx, and particulate matter. We estimate that the annual benefit of reduced air emissions from an average-size business distributed panel system is $1147. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air emissions; High frequency electricity data; Load profiles; Non-residential distributed solar consumers","Electric power transmission networks; Energy conservation; Energy utilization; Smart meters; Solar cell arrays; Solar concentrators; Solar energy; % reductions; Air emissions; Energy; Energy-saving benefits; Environmental benefits; Grid impacts; High frequency electricity data; Load profiles; Non-residential distributed solar consumer; Solar panels; Housing; atmospheric pollution; carbon dioxide; data set; detection method; electricity; electricity generation; empirical analysis; solar power; spatiotemporal analysis; Arizona; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102618949

The microalgae-based bioremediation approach presents a competitive alternative due to its capacity for nutrient recovery and carbon sequestration. However, process instabilities and operating challenges limit its development and implementation largely due to the complexities in the CW and biogas. In this study, the evolved native microalgal consortium (ENMC) was firstly developed using the gradual stress increase method to enhance their adaptation in high ammonium condition. The supplementation of local snow (with Ca2+ and Mg2+) and biogas into CW significantly enhanced ENMC growth through batch tests. Subsequently, an integrated ENMC-snow (ENMCS) system was proposed consisting of a hydrolysis-acidification reactor (HAR), biogas upgrade reactor, and photobioreactor (PBR). The ENMCS system was systematically investigated under both batch and semi-continuous operations, by adjusting primary process parameters including the fill ratio, feeding time, hydraulic retention time (HRT), wastewater pretreatment, and PBR type. It was eventually optimized as a 24 h, 70% fermented CW diluted with 30% snow water, semi-continuous feeding system with a fill ratio of 50% and HRT of 6 d in an open-PBR. Long-term operation (310 days) showed superior biomass yield (0.3059 ± 0.0039 g/(L•d)) and nutrient removal efficiencies (95.6 ± 0.13% and 90.8 ± 0.44% for NH4+-N and PO43−-P removal). Meanwhile, biogas was upgraded with an 82.2% CO2 reduction. The economic and environmental analysis further demonstrated the ENMCS system as an effective alternative for the bioremediation of AD effluents while simultaneously producing value-added biomass, especially applicable to snowy regions. © 2021","Biogas; Centrate wastewater; Gradual stress increase; Microalgal consortium; Snow","Anaerobic digestion; Bioremediation; Biotechnology; Effluents; Nutrients; Sludge digestion; Snow; Wastewater; Wastewater treatment; Anaerobics; Centrate; Centrate wastewater; Fill ratios; Gradual stress increase; Hydraulic retention; Microalgal consortium; Optimisations; Photobiore-actor; Retention time; Biogas; ammonia; biogas; calcium ion; magnesium ion; snow; biofuel; snow; ammonium; biogas; bioremediation; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; microalga; pollutant removal; sludge; wastewater; acidification; algal cell culture; algal growth; anaerobic digestion; Article; batch fermentation; biochemical composition; biofuel production; biomass; biomass production; bioremediation; Canada; carbon sequestration; centrate wastewater; chemical composition; controlled study; effluent; hydraulic retention time; microalga; nonhuman; oxidative stress; physiological stress; priority journal; process optimization; semicontinuous fermentation; sludge digestion; sludge reduction; waste water management; wastewater; bioremediation; wastewater; Biodegradation, Environmental; Biofuels; Biomass; Microalgae; Snow; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102868778

Therefore, in recent years, many cities in the world dedicate to promoting the electrification of public transport vehicles. Whereas due to the limitation of on-board battery capacity, the driving range of electric buses is relatively short. The accurate estimation of energy consumption on the electric bus routes is the premise of conducting bus scheduling and optimizing the layout of charging facilities. This study collected the actual operation data of three electric bus routes in Meihekou City, China, and established the support vector machine regression (SVR) model by taking the state of charge (SOC), trip travel time, mean environment temperature and air-conditioning operation time as the independent variables; while the energy consumptions of the route operations served as the dependent variables. Furthermore, the grey wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm was adopted to select the optimal parameters of the proposed model. Finally, a support vector machine regression model based on the grey wolf optimization algorithm (GWO-SVR) is proposed. Three real bus lines were taken as examples to validate the model. The results show that the mean average percentage error is 14.47% and the mean average error is 0.7776.

The fluorescence spectra of various Sm3+ ion concentrations and fixed 0.4 mol% Tm3+ and 0.5 mol% Tb3+ were measured and studied systematically excited by near-ultraviolet light of 355 nm. The Sm3+ ion concentration takes apparent effect on the relative intensity of peaks in the visible region and the color coordinate combining from these emission bands. A near pure white light emission with color coordinates (0.3295, 0.3057) and color temperature (5657 K) can be obtained when the concentrations of Tm3+, Tb3+ and Sm3+ ions are 0.4 mol%, 0.5 mol% and 0.8 mol%, respectively. Furthermore, the practical down-conversion internal quantum yield was measured by integrating spheres at about 14.39%. The tri-doped Na5Y9F32 single crystal shows a high thermal stability inferring from the temperature dependent emission in which the integrated emission intensities are reduced only by ∼3% with the increase of temperature from 280 to 450 K.

Understanding the responses of air pollutant concentrations to emission changes is critical for designing and evaluating effective control strategies. Thus, this study used the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to simulate PM2.5 (i.e., particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm) in winter (January 2015) and ozone (O3) in summer (July 2015) under nine emission reduction scenarios. For each scenario, the anthropogenic emissions of each air pollutant in each SCB grid cell were reduced by the same percentage, ranging from 10% to 90%. We found that approximately 30–70% emission reductions are required to reduce the January mean PM2.5 concentrations in all the SCB urban centers to a value that is less than the Chinese standard for daily mean PM2.5 (24-h PM2.5: 75 μg m−3). However, the January mean PM2.5 concentrations under 90% emission reduction still exceeded the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline (25 μg m−3) in 16 SCB urban centers. Moreover, reducing both SCB and non-SCB emissions were critical for achieving the PM2.5 level recommended by WHO. An 80% emission reduction was required to prevent the occurrence of 8-h O3 (i.e., daily maximum 8-h mean O3) non-attainment days in all SCB urban centers. Under 90% emission reduction, July mean 8-h O3 concentrations still exceeded the WHO guideline of 47 ppb in approximately 35% of the SCB areas. In conclusion, this study suggests that (1) compared with the governmental emission reduction targets for 2015–2020 (2–27%), more significant emission reductions are required to meet the Chinese and WHO pollution standards; and (2) both SCB and non-SCB emissions must significantly reduce to achieve the desired pollution targets. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Air pollution; Air quality; Chengdu; Chongqing; Sensitivity study","Air quality; Emission control; Ozone; Particles (particulate matter); Aerodynamic diameters; Air pollutant concentrations; Anthropogenic emissions; Community multi-scale air qualities; Emission reduction targets; Fine particulate matter; PM2.5 concentration; World Health Organization; Particulate emissions; ozone; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission control; ozone; particulate matter; sensitivity analysis; summer; winter; air pollutant; air pollution control; air quality; air temperature; ambient air; Article; China; Chinese; concentration (parameter); controlled study; grid cell; meteorology; particulate matter 2.5; precipitation; river basin; seasonal variation; solar radiation; urban area; World Health Organization; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; prevention and control; Chengdu; China; Chongqing; Sichuan; Sichuan Basin; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; Environmental Monitoring; Ozone; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101301741

It is necessary to evaluate the techno-economic performance of the new photovoltaic system deployment strategy for its actual implementation. In this paper, we comprehensively evaluated the power generation potential and economic performance of photovoltaics deployed on hyperbolic cooling towers in Mainland China. Based on the local solar radiation situations and electricity prices, we analyzed both the technical and economic performance of cooling towers photovoltaic (CT-PV) located in different cities. The results show that the total capacity of photovoltaic installations on all cooling towers reaches 1.05 GW, with corresponding annual power generation of 1.44 TWh. The total CO2 emission reduction and total profit by CT-PV cooling towers photovoltaic over a lifetime of 25 years can reach 31 Mts and 8.00 billion CNY, respectively. The return on investment is between 1.1 and 2.49, depending on the location. The payback period for all cities is less than 8 years, and around 90% of the cities’ solar generation electricity prices are below 0.35 CNY/kWh, which can compete with the benchmark price of coal-fired electricity.

Rapid expansion from the Jakarta's megapolitan is influencing Bekasi City and further leads to the massive conversion of urban green space into built-up areas. The land cover changes are affecting biomass and carbon sequestration capability of urban green space towards emissions from anthropogenic activities. Monitoring efforts through biomass estimation is important for a better understanding of the benefits of urban green spaces. Therefore, the goals of this study are to examine the best vegetation index used for interpreting urban green space, and analyze the spatial distribution of biomass. This study used Sentinel-2B satellite imageries acquired in 2020, and further employ them to generate four vegetation index, NDVI, GNDVI, SAVI, and OSAVI. The calculation of stand tree biomass was carried out by field measurements and allometric equations developed by the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Biomass estimation models developed from the relation between vegetation index and the observed biomass value The results of this study was that the best vegetation index was OSAVI with an accuracy rate of 99 %. The biomass produced in this study was 0.10149 tons/grid or 101.49 kg/grid to 1.913 tons/grid or 1913.99 kg. Bekasi dominated the low biomass value, while the value of biomass was more dominant in the Bekasi City Forest area.

Several communications claimed in the first weeks of March 2020 that the mitigation in air pollution observed at that time was actually related to these lockdown measures without considering that seasonal variations in emissions and meteorology also influence air quality. To determine the specific impact of lockdown measures on air quality in northern Italy, we compared observations from the European Commission Atmospheric Observatory of Ispra (regional background) and from the regional environmental protection agency (ARPA) air monitoring stations in the Milan conurbation (urban background) with expected values for these observations using two different approaches. On the one hand, intensive aerosol variables determined from specific aerosol characterisation observations performed in Ispra were compared to their 3-year averages. On the other hand, ground-level measured concentrations of atmospheric pollutants (NOspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""2/span, PMspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""10/span, Ospan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""3/span, NO, SOspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""2/span) were compared to expected concentrations derived from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service Regional (CAMS) ensemble model forecasts, which did not account for lockdown measures. From these comparisons, we show that NOspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""2/span concentrations decreased as a consequence of the lockdown by span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""-30/span % and span classCombining double low line""inline-formula""-40/span % on average at the urban and regional background sites, respectively. Unlike NOspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""2/span, PMspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""10/span concentrations were not significantly affected by lockdown measures. This could be due to any decreases in PMspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""10/span (and PMspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""10/span precursors) emissions from traffic being compensated for by increases in emissions from domestic heating and/or from changes in the secondary aerosol formation regime resulting from the lockdown measures. The implementation of the lockdown measures also led to an increase in the highest Ospan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""3/span concentrations at both the urban and regional background sites resulting from reduced titration of Ospan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""3/span by NO. The relaxation of the lockdown measures beginning in May resulted in close-To-expected NOspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""2/span concentrations in the urban background and to significant increases in PMspan classCombining double low line""inline-formula""10/span in comparison to expected concentrations at both regional and urban background sites./p. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) equipped with quantum dot enhancement films (QDEFs) offer extended color saturation, increasing said saturation from 60 to 70% to more than 100% of the NTSC color gamut. A plethora of research dealing with EL/PL properties and the device-based performance of these materials has been published. The tunable emission wavelength and the narrow emission bandwidth are the key features of quantum dots and perovskite nanoparticles that primarily depend on the nanoparticle size and material composition. QRs, in contrast, have a core-shell structure and emit polarized light that can roughly double the efficiency of modern displays. However, blue emission for QRs, because of the large bathochromic redshift during shell growth, is a serious problem. Besides photoluminescence, electroluminescence is also important for display applications. These QD-LEDs show a lower turn ON voltage in comparison to organic LEDs, which is very important for high-resolution displays. The solution-processed narrower emission QD-LEDs have already achieved efficiency and a brightness comparable to vacuum-deposited phosphorescent organic LEDs (OLEDs). However, the blue-emitting nanoparticles and their short operational lifetime are the key obstacles in the progression of these devices. Furthermore, recently the display and lighting industry are trying to reduce the short-wavelength emissions, particularly in the spectral region below 455 nm, which has a much greater impact on human ocular health and circadian rhythm. Thus, industries are aiming at blue light in the spectral range of 460-475 nm. This spectral range is very challenging for nanomaterials because of the limited choice of materials. In this review, we summarize the recent progress made in the blue-emitting nanomaterials with a different morphology and composition. This includes recent developments in low Cd materials. Both the PL and EL properties of these materials have been discussed depending on the NP's shape and material composition. This review also aims to discuss the various device architectures employing blue-emitting NPs, any recent achievements and future challenges. © 2021 Maksym F.

The stored carbon is called blue carbon. To date, studies relating strategy to enhance blue carbon storage is emerging. In developing a strategy to be applied to a natural resource, it is necessary to consider how it is affected and influences its people's lives. Meanwhile, the studies related to blue carbon management's social aspects are lacking compared to technical and policy aspects. This paper aims to identify peer-reviewed documents that discuss social aspects in the context of blue carbon management. This study uses a semi-systematic review approach by reviewing relevant documents based on determined keyword search terms. This study suggests that livelihood, land tenure, local knowledge, and local capacity are essential to incorporate in blue carbon management. The strategy must enforce communities to hold a significant role in governance. Those aspects would help to increase community engagement to manage and support blue carbon management. However, more extensive practical studies are needed to apply strategies on the real subject to strengthen the theory in recent literature. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The evolving regulatory market in the province of Ontario motivates the analysis of business cases for hydrogen on the industrial microgrid scale. This paper aims to investigate the financial and environmental returns associated with producing and storing electrolytic hydrogen for injection into the natural gas feed of a manufacturer’s combined heat and power plants (CHPs). A mathematical methodology was developed for investigating the optimal operation of the integrated system (power-to-gas along with the current system) by considering hydrogen-enriched natural gas. The result of this simulation is an operation plan that delivers optimal economics and an estimate of greenhouse gas emissions. The simulation was implemented across an entire year for each combination of generation price limit and storage coefficient. Because the provincial grid imposes a lesser carbon footprint than that of a pure natural gas turbine, any offset of natural gas by hydrogen reduces the carbon intensity of the system. From an environmental perspective, the amount of carbon abated by the model fell within a range of 3000 ton CO2 /year. From a policy perspective, this suggests that a minimum feasible carbon price of $60/ton CO2e must be set by applicable regulatory bodies. Lastly, a Failure Modes and Effects Analysis was performed for the proposed system to validate the safety of the design. © 2021 by the authors.

Eligibility for the credit requires firms to demonstrate legally specified emissions reductions for three pollutants. Firms typically demonstrate eligibility through laboratory tests, but results from the lab can differ from those in practice. Using a nationally comprehensive boiler-level panel dataset, we find that emission reductions in practice are only about half of the levels required, and even then only arise when certain pollution controls are installed. We also show that the policy reduces social welfare, resulting in costs more than seven times the benefits, in part because of a “rebound” effect in which the subsidy increases coal use by extending the operational life of some coal plants. Because the tax credit is up for reauthorization in 2021, our work has immediate policy relevance. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Coal; Electricity; Taxes and subsidies","Coal; Emission control; Coal plants; Emission reduction; Emissions reduction; Empirical assessment; Laboratory test; Local air pollutions; Operational life; Social welfare; Taxation; atmospheric pollution; coal seam; electricity generation; environmental economics; pollution control; pollution tax; tax system; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096560103

Most apple cultivars are obligate entomophilous species, and fruit quantity, quality and economic value are enhanced under insect pollination. Whilst the introduced European honey bee (Apis mellifera) is often assumed to be the main pollinator of apple in most regions of the world, including Australia, there is an increasing interest in alternative pollinators. The pollinator community of Tasmanian apple crops, however, has never been assessed. In this study, we surveyed four apple orchards for 3 days each during peak bloom in the Huon Valley region to characterise bee assemblages visiting blooming apple trees and the native bee fauna associated with surrounding flowering vegetation. Our results show that honey bees were the predominant visitors to apple blossoms (90.7% of visits), followed by the introduced bumble bee Bombus terrestris (5.9% of visits), with only a minor contribution by native bees (3.3% of visits). Twenty-six species of native bees were collected in total, of which only 10 species (five Exoneura (Apidae), four Lasioglossum (Halictidae) and one Euryglossa (Colletidae) species) were collected from apple blossoms, with Exoneura being the most abundant visitors. Few native bees were captured on apple blossoms, however co-blooming surrounding native vegetation, as well exotic flowers, hosted a high diversity and abundance of native bees. Site conditions influenced community composition, including abundance and representation of introduced bees compared to native bees visiting apples. Additionally, warmer temperatures favoured native bees. Collectively, our results suggest that Tasmania's apple production in its current state is unlikely to rely exclusively on native pollinators. Native bees nevertheless warrant conservation in such an insular crop production system. This can be achievable through retaining native flowering plants and even exotic non-crop flowers in and around orchards. Promoting the diversity and abundance of native bees through habitat enhancement may have additional benefits, such as filling current and future pollination demands and gaps, a key strategy under scenarios of climate change. © 2021 Australian Entomological Society","apple; bee; bumblebee; honey bee; native bee; Tasmania; weather; weed; wild bee; wildflower",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100162566

The tip/probe of SECM is usually an ultramicroelectrode (UME) or a nanoelectrode that can move towards or over the sample of interest controlled by a precise motor positioning system. Remarkably, electrocatalysts play a crucial role in addressing the surge in global energy consumption by providing sustainable alternative energy sources. Therefore, the precise measurement of catalytic reactions offers profound insights for designing novel catalysts as well as for enhancing their performance. SECM proves to be an excellent tool for characterization and screening catalysts as the probe can rapidly scan along one direction over the sample array containing a large number of different compositions. These features make SECM more appealing than other conventional methodologies for assessing bulk solutions. SECM can be employed for investigating numerous catalytic reactions including the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), oxygen evolution reaction (OER), hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), water oxidation, glucose oxidation reaction (GOR), and CO2 reduction reaction (CO2 RR) with high spatial resolution. Moreover, for improving the catalyst design, several SECM modes can be applied based on the catalytic reactions under evaluation. This review aims to present a brief overview of the recent applications of electrocatalysts and their kinetics as well as catalytic sites in electrochemical reactions, such as oxygen reduction, water oxidation, and methanol oxidation. © 2021 by the authors.

Desalination is a potential solution to mitigate the freshwater shortage. However, the process of desalination is expensive and energy-intensive. Due to the water-energy-climate nexus, there is an urgent need to provide sustainable low-cost electrical power for desalination that has the lowest impact on climate and related ecosystem challenges. For a large-scale reverse osmosis desalination plant, we have proposed the design and analysis of a photovoltaics and battery-based stand-alone direct current power network. The design methodology focusses on appropriate sizing, optimum tilt and temperature compensation techniques based on 10 years of irradiation data for the Carlsbad Desalination Plant in California, USA. A decision-tree approach is employed for ensuring hourly load-generation balance. The power flow analysis evaluates self-sufficient generation even during cloud cover contingencies. The primary goal of the proposed system is to maximize the utilization of generated photovoltaic power and battery energy storage with minimal conversions and transmission losses. The direct current based topology includes high-voltage transmission, on-the-spot local inversion, situational awareness and cyber security features. Lastly, economic feasibility of the proposed system is carried out for a plant lifetime of 30 years. The variable effect of utility-scale battery storage costs for 16–18 h of operation is studied. Our results show that the proposed design will provide low electricity costs ranging from 3.79 to 6.43 ¢/kWh depending on the debt rate. Without employing the concept of baseload electric power, photovoltaics and battery-based direct current power networks for large-scale desalination plants can achieve tremendous energy savings and cost reduction with negligible carbon footprint, thereby providing affordable water for all. © 2021 by the authors.

Here we combine satellite observations of tropospheric NO2 from TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument and the Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS)-Chem 3D chemical transport model to estimate that NO x emissions declined nationwide by ∼20% during the lockdown (23 March to 31 May 2020). Regionally, these range from 22% to 23% in the western portion of the country to 29% in the southeast and Manchester, and >40% in London. We apply a uniform 20% lockdown period emission reduction to GEOS-Chem anthropogenic emissions over the UK to determine that decline in lockdown emissions led to a national decline in PM2.5 of 1.1 μg m-3, ranging from 0.6 μg m-3 in Scotland to 2 μg m-3 in the southwest. The decline in emissions in cities (>40%) is greater than the national average and causes an increase in ozone of ∼2 ppbv in London and Manchester. The change in ozone and PM2.5 concentrations due to emission reductions alone is about half the total change from 2019 to 2020.

Numerous regions of the world have had varying responses in their attempts to contain the spread of the virus. Factors such as public health policies, governance, and sociopolitical climate have led to differential levels of success at controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Ultimately, a more advanced surveillance metric for COVID-19 transmission is necessary to help government systems and national leaders understand which responses have been effective and gauge where outbreaks occur. Objective: The goal of this study is to provide advanced COVID-19 surveillance metrics for Canada at the country, province, and territory level that account for shifts in the pandemic including speed, acceleration, jerk, and persistence. Enhanced surveillance identifies risks for explosive growth and regions that have controlled outbreaks successfully. Methods: Using a longitudinal trend analysis study design, we extracted 62 days of COVID-19 data from Canadian public health registries for 13 provinces and territories. We used an empirical difference equation to measure the daily number of cases in Canada as a function of the prior number of cases, the level of testing, and weekly shift variables based on a dynamic panel model that was estimated using the generalized method of moments approach by implementing the Arellano-Bond estimator in R. Results: We compare the week of February 7-13, 2021, with the week of February 14-20, 2021. Canada, as a whole, had a decrease in speed from 8.4 daily new cases per 100,000 population to 7.5 daily new cases per 100,000 population. The persistence of new cases during the week of February 14-20 reported 7.5 cases that are a result of COVID-19 transmissions 7 days earlier. The two most populous provinces of Ontario and Quebec both experienced decreases in speed from 7.9 and 11.5 daily new cases per 100,000 population for the week of February 7-13 to speeds of 6.9 and 9.3 for the week of February 14-20, respectively. Nunavut experienced a significant increase in speed during this time, from 3.3 daily new cases per 100,000 population to 10.9 daily new cases per 100,000 population. Conclusions: Canada excelled at COVID-19 control early on in the pandemic, especially during the first COVID-19 shutdown. The second wave at the end of 2020 resulted in a resurgence of the outbreak, which has since been controlled.

To provide these, regional atmospheric models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, need to be optimized in their physical setup to the region of interest. The objective of this study is to evaluate four cumulus physics (CU), two microphysics (MP), two planetary boundary layer physics (PBL), and two radiation physics (RA) schemes in WRF according to their performance in dynamically downscaling the precipitation over two typical South American regions: one orographically complex area in Ecuador/Peru (horizontal resolution up to 9 and 3 km), and one area of rolling hills in Northeast Brazil (up to 9 km). For this, an extensive ensemble of 32 simulations over two continuous years was conducted. Including the reference uncertainty of three high-resolution global datasets (CHIRPS, MSWEP, ERA5-Land), we show that different parameterization setups can produce up to four times the monthly reference precipitation. This underscores the urgent need to conduct parameterization sensitivity studies before weather forecasts or input for impact modeling can be produced. Contrarily to usual studies, we focus on distributional, temporal and spatial precipitation patterns and evaluate these in an ensemble-tailored approach. These ensemble characteristics such as ensemble Structure-, Amplitude-, and Location-error, allow us to generalize the impacts of combining one parameterization scheme with others. We find that varying the CU and RA schemes stronger affects the WRF performance than varying the MP or PBL schemes. This effect is even present in the convection-resolving 3-km-domain over Ecuador/Peru where CU schemes are only used in the parent domain of the one-way nesting approach. The G3D CU physics ensemble best represents the CHIRPS probability distribution in the 9-km-domains. However, spatial and temporal patterns of CHIRPS are best captured by Tiedtke or BMJ CU schemes. Ecuadorian station data in the 3-km-domain is best simulated by the ensemble whose parent domains use the KF CU scheme. Accounting for all evaluation metrics, no general-purpose setup could be identified, but suited parameterizations can be narrowed down according to final application needs. © Copyright © 2021 Portele, Laux, Lorenz, Janner, Horna, Fersch, Iza and Kunstmann.","CHIRPS 2.0; Ecuador; eSAL; northeast Brazil; parameterizations; Peru; sensitivity; weather research and forecasting (WRF) model","Agricultural robots; Boundary layers; Chirp modulation; Decision making; Image segmentation; Parameterization; Probability distributions; Water management; Climate information; Horizontal resolution; Parameterization schemes; Planetary boundary layers; Precipitation patterns; Spatial and temporal patterns; Temporal and spatial; Weather research and forecasting models; Weather forecasting; climate variation; decision making; downscaling; parameterization; precipitation assessment; sensitivity analysis; water management; weather forecasting; Brazil; Ecuador",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107052190

How were demography, society, and environment interconnected to give rise to the macroregional expansion pattern that archaeology is revealing? We simulate the demography and spatial behavior of the first farming communities in the Central Balkans in order to infer the parameters and mechanisms of the Neolithic expansion in this part of Europe. We compare the simulation output to the empirical record of radiocarbon dates in order to systematically evaluate which expansion scenarios were the most probable. Our results suggest that if the expansion of the Neolithic unfolded in accord with the specific wave of advance model that we presented in this paper, the expansion was driven by very high fertility and community fission to avoid social tensions. The simulation suggests that the number of children born by an average Neolithic woman who lived through her entire fertile period was around 8 children or more, which is on the high end of the ethnographically recorded human total fertility rate spectrum. The most plausible simulated fission threshold values are between 50 and 100 people, which is usually smaller than the estimated environmental carrying capacity. This would suggest that the primary reason for the community fission and for seeking out new land was social rather than ecological. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Balkans; Fertility; Neolithic expansion; Paleodemography; Scalar stress; Simulation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103999171

As countries implement their GHG reduction targets under the Paris climate agreement, the co-emissions of aerosols and their precursors will also change. Since these co-emissions vary by country and by economic sector, each country will face different tradeoffs between aerosol-driven health or temperature co-benefits. We combine simple parameterizations of physical processes and health outcomes to examine three idealized climate policy approaches that are consistent with the Paris Agreement targets, which (i) optimize for local air quality, (ii) reduce global temperature change, or (iii) reduce emissions equally from all domestic economic sectors. We evaluate aerosol impacts on premature mortality and global mean temperature change under these three policy approaches and find that by 2030 the three policies yield differences of over 1 million annual premature deaths and global temperature differences of the same magnitude as those from GHG reductions. We also show that implementing equal reductions between all economic sectors can actually result in less beneficial health and temperature outcomes than either of the other options, especially in less industrialized regions. We therefore conclude that aerosol-related co-benefits and aerosol accounting guidelines should be explicitly considered in setting international climate policy. © 2021.

Potential distribution modelling is routinely used to predict the dynamics of such range expansions, giving insights on which areas are climatically suitable for establishment. However, even in areas where climatic conditions are unsuitable, colonization may be still possible in sub-areas with particular, human activity-driven microclimates, such as cities. We used as a model species the Asian mud-dauber wasp Sceliphron curvatum (Hymenoptera: Sphecidae), which arrived in Europe 40 years ago, to show that cities may be used by alien species to enlarge their distribution into climatically non-optimal areas. By using an average consensus from six different models, we predicted that, based on climate, S. curvatum would find the highest suitability in most part of Mediterranean basin, which are characterized by high summer temperatures and reduced climatic oscillations. The species is indeed often observed in such areas, but also in Central Europe, where suitability is overall lower. At such latitudes, however, the wasp was more often found in cities (which have the highest suitability) than in peri-urban and rural areas, possibly according to the urban ‘heat island’ effect. In Southern Europe, where climate is overall more favourable for the species, suitability tended to be more similar in both urban and rural environments, and urban detections were indeed rarer. The inclusion of population density in the model improved the suitability of Northern areas in an expected urbanization-driven jeopardized pattern. Hence, S. curvatum would be able to colonize in the future at least some climatically unsuitable Northern areas, reaching up to 70° latitude, by using cities as the main sites for establishment. © 2020 Elsevier Masson SAS","Biological invasions; Heat islands; Potential distribution; Sceliphron curvatum; Sphecidae; Urban areas","colonization; heat island; human activity; introduced species; population density; range expansion; rural area; urban area; wasp; Central Europe; Southern Europe; Hexapoda; Hymenoptera; Sceliphron; Sphecidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097405972

Recently, chemists also started to exploit intricate phenomena such as the interplay of local and global (anti)aromaticity or aromaticity in non-planar systems and three dimensions. These phenomena pose new challenges in terms of our fundamental understanding and the practical visualisation of aromaticity. To overcome these challenges, a method for the visualisation of chemical shielding tensors (VIST) is developed here that allows for a 3D visualisation with quantitative information about the local variations and anisotropy of the chemical shielding. After exemplifying the method in different planar hydrocarbons, we study two non-planar macrocycles to show the unique benefits of the VIST method for molecules with competing π-conjugated systems and conclude with a norcorrole dimer showing clear evidence of through-space aromaticity. We believe that the VIST method will be a highly valuable addition to the computational toolbox. © 2021 The Authors.

The use of plastics in any form releases microplastics to the environment. Existing policy instruments are insufficient to address microplastics pollution and regulatory measures have focussed only on the microbeads and single-use plastics. Fees on the use of plastic products may possibly reduce their usage, but effective management of plastic products at their end-of-life is lacking. Therefore, in this study, the microplastic–failure mode and effect analysis (MP–FMEA) methodology, which is a semi-qualitative approach capable of identifying the causes and proposing solutions for the issue of microplastics pollution, has been proposed. The innovative feature of MP–FMEA is that it has a pre-defined failure mode, that is, the release of microplastics to air, water and soil (depending on the process) or the occurrence of microplastics in the final product. Moreover, a theoretical recycling plant case study was used to demonstrate the advantages and disadvantages of this method. The results revealed that MP–FMEA is an easy and heuristic technique to understand the failure-effect-causes and solutions for reduction of microplastics and can be applied by researchers working in different domains apart from those relating to microplastics. Future studies can include the evaluation of the use of MP–FMEA methodology along with quantitative methods for effective reduction in the release of microplastics. © The Author(s) 2021.","microplastics; Microplastic–failure mode and effect analysis; mitigation measures; plastic recycling; risk analysis","Elastomers; Failure (mechanical); Failure modes; Heuristic methods; Metal drawing; Microbeads; Plastic products; Plastics industry; Pollution; Different domains; Effective management; Failure mode and effect analysis; Failure mode and effects analysis; Heuristic techniques; Policy instruments; Qualitative approach; Quantitative method; Microplastic; biodegradable plastic; microplastic; plastic; water; failure mechanism; heuristics; plastic waste; policy making; research work; waste management; Article; bioremediation; failure mode and effects analysis; human; marine environment; middle income country; municipal solid waste; particulate matter; pollution; pyrolysis; quantitative analysis; recycling; risk factor; soil; soil quality; solid waste management; suspended particulate matter; theoretical study; waste management; waste water treatment plant; work environment; environmental monitoring; healthcare failure mode and effect analysis; pollution; water pollutant; Environmental Monitoring; Environmental Pollution; Healthcare Failure Mode and Effect Analysis; Microplastics; Plastics; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103428870

Employing a simulation model (MAGNET), this study examines the sustainability implications arising from the adoption of recommended daily nutrition requirements inspired by the ‘Lancet’ reference diet. To measure sustainability, changes in ‘virtual’ requirements and associated tier footprints for irrigation (blue) water, agricultural land and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) are calculated. Assuming business-as-usual food consumption trends, between 2015 and 2050 blue water, agricultural land and emissions rise 34%, 9% and 44%, respectively, whilst corresponding increases in Sub-Saharan Africa are much higher. By 2050, the switch to the reference diet decreases agricultural land use by -8% and emissions by -9%. Global blue water and cropland requirements increase by 5%, whilst significant concomitant savings in permanent pastureland (-21%) are expected. By region, the diet switch drives rising blue water consumption in Oceania and the EU and agricultural land savings in Latin America and Oceania, accompanied by cropland increases in the EU and North Africa. The reference diet generates substantial reductions in GHG emissions, particularly in Latin America. Interestingly, Sub-Saharan Africa which abstains from the reference diet due to affordability considerations, benefits from a ‘rebound’ effect from falling meat and dairy prices.

The continued vitality of agricultural systems depends on economic conditions that support farmers’ livelihoods. Exploring the long-term effects of adaptations requires modeling agricultural and economic conditions to engage stakeholders upon whom the burden of any adaptation will rest. Here, we use a new freeware model FEWCalc (Food-Energy-Water Calculator) to project farm incomes based on climate, crop selection, irrigation practices, water availability, and economic adaptation of adding renewable energy production. Thus, FEWCalc addresses United Nations Global Sustainability Goals No Hunger and Affordable and Clean Energy. Here, future climate scenario impacts on crop production and farm incomes are simulated when current agricultural practices continue so that no agricultural adaptations are enabled. The model Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer (DSSAT) with added arid-region dynamics is used to simulate agricultural dynamics. Demonstrations at a site in the midwest USA with 2008–2017 historical data and two 2018–2098 RCP climate scenarios provide an initial quantification of increased agricultural challenges under climate change, such as reduced crop yields and increased financial losses. Results show how this finding is largely driven by increasing temperatures and changed distribution of precipitation throughout the year. Without effective technological advances and operational and policy changes, the simulations show how rural areas could increasingly depend economically on local renewable energy, while agricultural production from arid regions declines by 50% or more. © 2020","Climate scenarios; Food energy and water; Freely available system analysis software; Renewable energy; Stakeholder engagement","Agricultural robots; Arid regions; Climate models; Crops; Cultivation; Decision support systems; Losses; Renewable energy resources; Water management; Agricultural practices; Agricultural productions; Agrotechnology transfer; Future climate scenarios; Global sustainability; Increasing temperatures; Irrigation practices; Technological advances; Climate change; ground water; agricultural production; alternative energy; climate variation; crop production; farming system; food consumption; rural area; scenario analysis; stakeholder; agricultural management; aquifer; climate change; Decision Support System for Agrotechnology Transfer model; environmental monitoring; environmental policy; environmental temperature; Food Energy Water Calculator model; food energy water system; harvest; household; India; mathematical model; mathematical parameters; precipitation; resource management; simulation; socioeconomics; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097398189

Inclusive decision making is essential to ensure REDD outcomes, but there is limited anecdotal and empirical evidence demonstrating that stakeholder participation in REDD+ decision making has improved over time. This paper presents an analysis of the Vietnamese government's claim that stakeholder participation in REDD+ had been improved over the course of 2011–2019, specifically focusing on various actors’ perceptions of their level of interest, engagement and influence in REDD+ policy events. Findings show that the country's legal framework on REDD+ demonstrated Vietnam's political commitment to improve inclusive decision making, and initial effort was made to provide political space for actors to engage in REDD+ decision making. However, momentum has been lost over time. This suggests that understanding the political context, addressing underlying power dynamics in the existing government regime, building up coalitions for change among political elites and civil society, and fostering sustainable political will and commitment are all essential to ensuring inclusive REDD+ decision making in Vietnam. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Inclusiveness; Participation; Policies; REDD+; Vietnam","decision making; deforestation; emission control; environmental degradation; government; international agreement; legislation; local participation; perception; pollution policy; stakeholder; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102316317

The effects of wastewater irrigation on rice yield and quality, as well as on the environment, with particular focus on greenhouse gas emissions from paddy fields with municipal wastewater irrigation, have gained substantial attention. In this study, bench-scale experiments were conducted in two cultivation seasons where seedlings of Bekoaoba, a large-grain high-yield rice variety, were transplanted and irrigated with TWW without fertilization. A control experiment was performed to simulate the cultivation conditions of normal paddy fields. The study aimed to quantify the effects of TWW irrigation on rice yield and quality, in addition to CH4 and N2O emissions. The highest rice yield (10.4 t ha−1) and protein content in brown rice (13.8%) was achieved when the soil was repeatedly subjected to bottom-to-top TWW irrigation without any synthetic fertilizer. Bottom-to-top TWW irrigation decreased CH4 emissions by up to 95.6% when compared with tap water irrigation, whereas bottom-to-top and top-to-top TWW irrigation increased N2O emissions by 5 and 15 times, respectively. Bottom-to-top irrigation of TWW could be considered a promising solution for reducing greenhouse gas emissions as TWW irrigation resulted in a lower combined global warming potential than tap water irrigation. Further, bottom-to-top irrigation of TWW produced less CH4 and N2O than top-to-top irrigation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Bottom-to-top irrigation; Greenhouse gas; High yield and quality rice; Soil redox potential; Treated wastewater irrigation","agricultural emission; crop yield; cultivation; experimental study; fertilizer application; food quality; global warming; irrigation; methane; nitrous oxide; paddy field; wastewater treatment; fertilizer; methane; nitrous oxide; agriculture; China; greenhouse gas; Oryza; soil; wastewater; Agriculture; China; Fertilizers; Greenhouse Gases; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Oryza; Soil; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099472605

This study provides a consolidated synthesis of estimates for all anthropogenic and natural sources and sinks of CO2 for the European Union and UK (EU27 + UK), derived from a combination of state-of-the-art bottom-up (BU) and top-down (TD) data sources and models. Given the wide scope of the work and the variety of datasets involved, this study focuses on identifying essential questions which need to be answered to properly understand the differences between various datasets, in particular with regards to the less-well-characterized fluxes from managed ecosystems. The work integrates recent emission inventory data, process-based ecosystem model results, data-driven sector model results and inverse modeling estimates over the period 1990-2018. BU and TD products are compared with European national greenhouse gas inventories (NGHGIs) reported under the UNFCCC in 2019, aiming to assess and understand the differences between approaches. For the uncertainties in NGHGIs, we used the standard deviation obtained by varying parameters of inventory calculations, reported by the member states following the IPCC Guidelines. Variation in estimates produced with other methods, like atmospheric inversion models (TD) or spatially disaggregated inventory datasets (BU), arises from diverse sources including within-model uncertainty related to parameterization as well as structural differences between models. In comparing NGHGIs with other approaches, a key source of uncertainty is that related to different system boundaries and emission categories (CO2 fossil) and the use of different land use definitions for reporting emissions from land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF) activities (CO2 land). At the EU27 + UK level, the NGHGI (2019) fossil CO2 emissions (including cement production) account for 2624 Tg CO2 in 2014 while all the other seven bottom-up sources are consistent with the NGHGIs and report a mean of 2588 (± 463 Tg CO2). The inversion reports 2700 Tg CO2 (± 480 Tg CO2), which is well in line with the national inventories. Over 2011-2015, the CO2 land sources and sinks from NGHGI estimates report-90 Tg C yr-1 ± 30 Tg C yr-1 while all other BU approaches report a mean sink of-98 Tg C yr-1 (± 362 Tg of C from dynamic global vegetation models only). For the TD model ensemble results, we observe a much larger spread for regional inversions (i.e., mean of 253 Tg C yr-1 ± 400 Tg C yr-1). This concludes that (a) current independent approaches are consistent with NGHGIs and (b) their uncertainty is too large to allow a verification because of model differences and probably also because of the definition of ""CO2 flux""obtained from different approaches.

In Indonesia's case, many small and medium-scale agro-industries have problems in treating or in valorising their wastes. Specific to wastewater, due to lack of waste treatment facilities or financial support, as well as lack of policies enforcement, many agro-industries directly disposed of the wastewater to the river bodies. Such practices can have a detrimental effect on the environment due to the accumulation of both organic and an-organic pollutants. This study aimed to investigate the potential of various agro-industrial wastewater (i.e. batik wastewater, tofu-processing wastewater and tempeh-processing wastewater) from Malang City as single feedstock for biogas production. The biochemical methane potential (BMP) test was employed under a mesophilic condition and operated for 28 days. The results indicated that anaerobic digestion (AD) of tempeh-processing wastewater produced more biogas and methane potential compared to other wastewater samples. The specific methane potential (SMP) from the AD of tempeh-processing wastewater was 0.027 m3/kgVSadded. However, the energy potential calculation indicated that using these wastewater samples was not feasible as a single feedstock for an anaerobic digestion system.

This disequilibrium between climate and community composition could diminish, however, when critical climate thresholds are exceeded, due to population declines or losses among the more mismatched species. Here, we assessed the effect of an extreme drought event on rich semiarid shrubland communities in the south-eastern Iberian Peninsula. Using a community climate framework, we compared the community climatic disequilibrium before and after the drought episode on three study sites with different levels of precipitation. Disequilibrium was estimated as the difference between observed reference climate and community-inferred climate, calculated as the mean climatic optimum for the species present, weighted by their abundances. We found that extreme drought embedded within a decadal trend of increasing aridity led to a significant reduction in community climatic disequilibrium, and that this reduction was positively related to water deficit (low P/PET values). In contrast, microhabitat variables such as vegetation cover or slope, did not emerge as significant predictors of changes in community climatic disequilibrium. Our study highlights that extreme drought events pushing communities in the same direction as climate trends may decrease community climatic mismatch, leading to communities more adapted to aridity through loss of drought-sensitive species. These findings underscore that extreme events will play a crucial role in speeding up climate-induced community transformations and biodiversity losses. © 2021 Nordic Society Oikos.

At many institutions, adjuvant radiation is recommended; definitive radiation is also recommended for the treatment of unresectable tumors. Because of the high off-target radiation toxicities associated with conventional radiotherapy, there has been growing interest in the use of proton and heavyion therapies. The aim of this study was to systematically review the literature regarding these therapies. METHODS The PubMed, OVID, Embase, and Web of Science databases were queried for articles describing the use of proton, combined proton/photon, or heavy-ion therapies for adjuvant or definitive radiotherapy in patients with primary sarcoma or chordoma of the mobile spine and sacrum. A qualitative synthesis of the results was performed, focusing on overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS), disease-free survival (DFS), and disease-specific survival (DSS); local control; and postradiation toxicities. RESULTS Of 595 unique articles, 64 underwent full-text screening and 38 were included in the final synthesis. All studies were level III or IV evidence with a high risk of bias; there was also significant overlap in the reported populations, with six centers accounting for roughly three-fourths of all reports. Five-year therapy outcomes were as follows: proton-only therapies, OS 67%—82%, PFS 3l%—57%, and DFS 52%—62%; metastases occurred in 17%—18% and acute toxicities in 3%—100% of cases; combined proton/photon therapy, local control 62%—85%, OS 78%—87%, PFS 90%, and DFS 61%—72%; metastases occurred in 12%—14% and acute toxicities in 84%—100% of cases; and carbon ion therapy, local control 53%—100%, OS 52%—86%, PFS (only reported for 3 years) 48%—76%, and DFS 5o%—53%; metastases occurred in 2%—39% and acute toxicities in 26%-48%. There were no studies directly comparing outcomes between photon and charged-particle therapies or comparing outcomes between radiation and surgical groups. CONCLUSIONS The current evidence for charged-particle therapies in the management of sarcomas of the spine and sacrum is limited. Preliminary evidence suggests that with these therapies local control and OS at 5 years are comparable among various charged-particle options and may be similar between those treated with definitive charged-particle therapy and historical surgical cohorts. Further research directly comparing charged-particle and photon-based therapies is necessary. © 2021 AANS.

Based on the monthly data of man-made emission sources in Asia from the 2008 East Asia MIX emission inventory, this study analyzed the temporal and spatial distribution characteristics of air pollutants including PM2.5, PM10, CO, CO2, NOx, OC, etc., and explored the difference and variation law of material concentration distribution between designated special regions, as well as the possible impact of various atmospheric systems on them. Firstly, in most areas of China, the distribution of pollutants has obvious temporal and spatial differences, and the overall trend of pollutant concentration is higher in the north than in the south. The results show that the monthly variation trend of pollutants in India is significantly correlated with that in China. However, compared with the monthly trend in northern China, it is not particularly obvious. © 2021 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.",,"Air pollution; Concentration distributions; Continuous development; Distribution characteristics; Emission inventories; Environmental governances; Pollutant concentration; Temporal and spatial; Temporal and spatial distribution; Spatial distribution",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105989097

However, a few previous studies have examined these two concepts together at the choice level of CEB. This paper discusses the internal selection logic of CEB by using multinomial logit (MNL) models that consider the choices of enterprises in green innovation and illegal emissions, both across China and separately in different regions. The objective of this paper is to consider the four choices available to heavily polluting enterprises’ dual-target corporate environmental behavior (DTCEB), including alienated, conservative, contradictory, and intimate environmental behaviors. The results of this study show that, under various external pressures, 61.2% of heavily polluting enterprises choose conservative environmental behavior. There is also generally a lack of synchronization between the goals of short-term economic and long-term social benefits. At the current stage, environmental regulation measures should focus on guiding enterprises to change from alienated, conservative, and contradictory behaviors, to intimate. Instead of only focusing on monitoring pollution emissions, the government should focus on green innovation guidance to effectively promote the transformation and upgrading of heavily polluting enterprises. A moderate adjustment of the intensity of command regulation may lead to better regulatory effects. Specifically, the enforcement of laws across China should be slowed; efforts should be made to increase the focus of public participation in the eastern region; the importance of incentive-based tax rate preferences should be increased in the central region, and the intensity of legislation should be strengthened in the western region. Compared with the emphasis on environmental performance in other literature, this article uses comparative thinking to explore the choice logic of the DTCEBs, which attaches different degrees of importance to long-term social benefits and short-term economic benefits. © 2021","Dual-target corporate environmental behavior; Environmental regulation; Green innovation; Heavily polluting enterprises; Pollutant emissions","Computer circuits; Economic and social effects; Environmental management; Pollution; Taxation; Corporates; Dual-target corporate environmental behavior; Environment regulations; Environmental behavior; Green innovations; Heavily polluting enterprise; Hot topics; Pollutants emissions; Short term; Social benefits; Environmental regulations",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102855400

An analysis of public behaviour, motivation and general knowledge on WEEE management was undertaken in Southampton, England. All respondents were members of the People's Panel run by Southampton City Council. The potential monetary value that could be secured via the resale of WEEE that could be repaired was estimated. The value was calculated for three scenarios – low, middle and high for the years 2020, 2025 and 2030. Carbon footprints were calculated for four disposal routes to enable a comparison of the three scenarios. Analysis of the survey shows that respondents’ knowledge about WEEE management is deficient. The survey results highlighted a high level of confusion regarding correct identification and management of WEEE and a perception that collection services are inconvenient. The incorrect disposal of WEEE is costly; the potential resale value of WEEE disposed of in UK residual waste bins could be as much as £196–215 million by 2030. Reducing the quantity of WEEE entering UK landfills, including WEEE incorrectly disposed via the residual waste stream, via reuse and recycling could allow total emission reductions of between 312 and 344 Mt CO2e by 2030. Incinerating WEEE also leads to carbon savings, however at the cost of losing recyclable materials and critical metals. The correct capture of this waste stream would therefore generate significant economic, environmental and resource benefits nationally and globally. The study has also highlighted the crucial need for raising public awareness about WEEE management and indicated that kerbside collection services for WEEE would probably be beneficial and popular. © 2021","Carbon footprint; Collection; Economic analysis; Survey; Waste management; WEEE","Bins; Carbon footprint; Electronic equipment; Emission control; Sales; Surveys; Waste disposal; General knowledge; Public awareness; Public behaviour; Recyclable material; Resource benefits; Reuse and recycling; Total emissions; Waste electrical and electronic equipment; Electronic Waste; carbon footprint; climate effect; economic analysis; economic impact; electronic equipment; electronic waste; perception; survey; waste disposal; waste management; Article; calculation; carbon footprint; climate change; controlled study; e-waste; landfill; prediction; questionnaire; social status; United Kingdom; waste disposal; England; Southampton [England]; United Kingdom",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100425055

In this study the non-methane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) and H2S emission and odor activity dynamics over time after field application of pig and cattle manure were investigated. Furthermore, three different application techniques, trailing hoses, trailing shoes, and trailing hoses applying manure 20 cm above canopy, was compared. With a flexible system combining dynamic chambers and Proton-Transfer-Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectroscopy (PTR-TOF-MS), H2S and 22 different NMVOC were measured, identified, and quantified. From pig manure high amounts of H2S was measured right after application, resulting in high odor activity values (OAV). During the first 10 h 4-methylphenol accounted for most of the cumulative emissions and OAV. Carboxylic acids were emitted for a longer period, and accounted for most of the long-term emissions and OAV. Acetic acid alone accounted for 33–57% of the total cumulative emissions. Trailing shoes were found to reduce NMVOC emission under certain conditions. It is suggested to use updated ratios from this study to calculate NMVOC emissions relative to ammonia emissions. The average ratios of cumulated NMVOC emission divided by cumulated ammonia emission 90 h after application of pig manure is 1.15±0.55 and 0.72±0.26 for trailing hoses and trailing shoes respectively, whereas the equivalent numbers for cattle manure is 0.43±0.11 and 0.18±0.04. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Dynamic chambers; Odor activity value; Odor emission; Trailing hoses; Trailing shoes","Ammonia; Fertilizers; Hose; Hydrogen sulfide; Inductively coupled plasma; Mammals; Mass spectrometry; Proton transfer; Sulfur compounds; Tunnel junctions; Volatile organic compounds; Activity dynamics; Ammonia emissions; Cumulative emissions; Non-methane volatile organic compounds; Odor activity value (OAV); Proton transfer reactions; Time-of-flight mass spectroscopy; Volatile organic compound (VOC); Manures; 2 butanol; 2 butanone; 2 propanol; 2,3 butanedione; 4 ethylphenol; acetaldehyde; acetic acid; acetone; acetyl acetone; alcohol; ammonia; benzene; butyric acid; carboxylic acid; chemical compound; cyclohexene; dimethylsufide; formic acid; hydrogen sulfide; isoprene; methanethiol; methanol; non methane volatile organic compound; para cresol; phenol; propionic acid; sulfur derivative; trimethylamine; unclassified drug; volatile organic compound; acetic acid; atmospheric pollution; carboxylic acid; emission; hydrogen sulfide; manure; odor; volatile organic compound; wind tunnel; agricultural slurry; air pollution; air temperature; Article; canopy; cattle manure; controlled study; limit of detection; mass fragmentography; measurement; odor; odor activity value; pH; priority journal; proton transfer reaction time of flight mass spectroscopy; soil temperature; swine manure; time of flight mass spectrometry; wind tunnel",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098116577

Oil palms produce palm oil, the basic commodity of a highly important industry. Climate change from greenhouse gasses is likely to decrease the ability of palms to survive, irrespective of them providing ecosystem services to communities. Little information about species survival in tropical regions under climate change is available and data on species migration under climate change is important. Palms are particularly significant in Africa: a palm oil industry already exists with Nigeria being the largest producer. Previous work using CLIMEX modelling indicated that Africa will have reduced suitable climate for oil palm in Africa. The current paper employs this modelling to assess how suitable climate for growing oil palm changed in Africa from current time to 2100. An increasing trend in suitable climate from west to east was observed indicating that refuges could be obtained along the African tropical belt. Most countries had reduced suitable climates but others had increased, with Uganda being particularly high. There may be a case for developing future oil palm plantations towards the east of Africa. The information may be usefully applied to other palms. However, it is crucial that any developments will fully adhere to environmental regulations. Future climate change will have severe consequences to oil palm cultivation but there may be scope for eastwards mitigation in Africa. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Democratic Republic of Congo; Elaeis guineensis; Global warming; Longitude; Suitable climate; Trend","climate change; cultivation; empirical analysis; future prospect; growth; longitudinal gradient; tropical environment; tropical region; Nigeria; Uganda; Elaeis; Elaeis guineensis; palm oil; Arecaceae; climate change; ecosystem; Nigeria; tropic climate; Uganda; Arecaceae; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Nigeria; Palm Oil; Tropical Climate; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099057561

There is also a dynamic growth of vehicles on the roads, which is why an increasing number of cities are introducing intelligent transportation systems (ITS), which is part of the concept of smart cities. This paper proposes a new matrix to assess the effects of the ITS implementation in the context of a concept Smart City, which consists of five criteria: (1) movement speed; (2) safety; (3) environmental; (4) economic; (5) satisfaction and amenities for society/passengers. In this new approach the benchmark values of the indicators assigned to the criteria are involved and, therefore, it is possible to determine the level of effectiveness of the ITS in public transport that uses low-carbon energy. This research used literature studies to establish the criteria of effectiveness of ITS as well as a case study, namely public transport that uses low-carbon energy in a Polish city, which had the largest fleet of electric buses in Poland and implements and uses an ITS. Both, the theoretical and the empirical research results demonstrate the usefulness and potency of the proposed matrix to assess the effects of the ITS implementation in cities in the context of the development of a smart city. In that way, the proposed approach may be a useful tool for measuring the effects of ITS implementation in cities. © 2021 by the authors.

The sorghum fresh matter (FM) varied among the sorghum types, including the parameters total solids (TS; 22.69%–46.93%FM), water-soluble carbohydrates (2.68%–11.38%TS), and nitrates (0%–0.35%TS). The excellent ensiling ability of all the sorghum types analyzed was confirmed by evaluating the fermentation profile (pH range of 3.7–4.6; dominant presence of lactic acid [LA]; acetic acid [AA] in the range of 0.70%–2.38%TS; insignificant amount of butyric acid). The SMY ranged between 231.25 and 321.31 Ln kg−1 VS and tended to decrease with the increasing harvest time and maturity. LA and AA were positively correlated with the SMY, while the neutral detergent fiber content was negatively correlated with it. The SMY—a key parameter reflecting the crop biomass quality for biogas production—was slightly higher for S. bicolor than for the sorghum hybrids. However, the results of this study confirmed that if the final purpose is biomethanation, the ensilability of different sorghum types imposes no restriction. Furthermore, different sorghum types offer a wide harvest window, which can be useful for cropping schemes, ensiling, and methane production. © 2021 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd","anaerobic digestion; harvest date; maturity; methane yield; phenological stage; silage; sorghum; variety","Anaerobic digestion; Ascorbic acid; Biomass; Butyric acid; Crops; Harvesting; Lactic acid; Methane; pH; Bio-methanation; Biogas production; Biomass quality; Harvest windows; Methane production; Neutral detergent fiber; Temperate regions; Water-soluble carbohydrates; Plants (botany); anaerobic digestion; biomass; experimental study; fermentation; harvesting; maturation; methane; phenology; silage; sorghum; yield response; Germany; Sorghum bicolor; Sorghum bicolor bicolor; Sorghum x drummondii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101263822

The fatigue strength of the decarburized layer is low compared to the base metal, which can easily develop fatigue cracks. Recently, fatigue failure was reported in the tension clamp (SKL 15) of the DFF‐300 rail fastening system during use on one urban transit route in South Korea. As a result of measuring the depth of the decarburized layer of the SKL 15 tension clamp where the fatigue failure occurred, a decarburized layer thinner than the manufacturer’s maximum allowable decarburized layer was found in one of the eight tension clamps. To check the depth of the decarburized layer where the fatigue crack may have initiated, the decarburized layer was assumed to be the initial crack, and fatigue crack initiation was assessed based on the linear elastic fracture mechanics. The manufacturer’s maximum allowable decarbu-rized layer depth of 0.2 mm may result in fatigue cracks. © 2021 by the authors.

The government has applied different emission regulations depending on the fuel, following the regulations set for gasoline vehicles in California, USA, and those set for diesel vehicles in the European Union (EU). In this study, the on-road NOx emissions of 109 light-duty vehicles in South Korea were measured on roads in Seoul and the surrounding metropolitan area using a portable emissions measurement system (PEMS). The results were then analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness of the emission regulations introduced in Korea for NOx reduction. The average on-road NOx emissions for the Euro 5 and Euro 6b diesel vehicles were approximately five times higher than the laboratory emission limits set by the EU regulation. The NOx emissions also showed significant variation depending on the driving parameters, such as the driving dynamics and the ambient temperature. From the Euro 6d-TEMP regulation in which the real driving emissions-light duty vehicles (RDE-LDV) regulatory package was implemented, the average on-road NOx emissions from the diesel vehicles were controlled within the laboratory emission limits, but were still higher than those of the gasoline vehicles. Despite the absence of the RDE-LDV regulations, the average on-road NOx emissions of the gasoline vehicles that had ultra-low emission vehicle (ULEV) and super ultra-low emission vehicle (SULEV) standard certifications were controlled within the laboratory emission limits set by the FTP-75, regardless of the various driving parameters. The results of this study show that it is necessary to include a wide range of driving conditions in emission certification test procedures, such as RDE-LDV, and enhance the regulatory measures that enable manufacturers to maintain the effectiveness of emission control systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Emission regulations; NOx; PEMS; RDE-LDV; Vehicle emissions","Air pollution control equipment; Automobile manufacture; Diesel engines; Diesel locomotives; Emission control; Gasoline; Nitrogen oxides; Road vehicles; Roads and streets; Testing; Certification tests; Driving conditions; Driving parameters; Emission regulation; Light duty vehicles; Portable emissions measurement systems (PEMS); Super ultra low emission vehicle standards; Ultra Low Emission Vehicles; Light weight vehicles; diesel fuel; gasoline; nitrogen oxide; atmospheric pollution; emission control; measurement method; metropolitan area; nitrogen oxides; regulatory framework; traffic emission; air pollution; Article; control system; environmental policy; environmental temperature; exhaust gas; motor vehicle; pollution control; priority journal; South Korea; speeding (driving); South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098958629

Northern cropping systems may benefit from longer and warmer growing seasons, but the sustainability of production will be challenged due to increased production risks. Concentrated efforts are needed to find ways to adapt cropping to changing conditions and sustainably intensify production. OBJECTIVE: This study combined stakeholder knowledge and simulation modelling to find means for the sustainable intensification of cereal production in the North Savo region in Finland. METHODS: Stakeholders identified promising intensification measures in two workshops. Alternative options for sustainable intensification and climate adaptations and their combinations were assessed using the APSIM cropping system model. The model was used to assess cereal yields, the grain nitrogen (N) content, nitrate leaching and water productivity for a historical baseline (1981–2010) and mid-century conditions (2041–2070) projected by five general circulation models for different emission scenarios. Simulated management options included improved cultivars with later maturing characteristics, improved heat/drought resistance and nitrogen-use efficiency, increased N fertilisation levels, improved crop rotations together with improved soil, as well as supplementary and full irrigation. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The simulation results indicated that although a warming climate in conjunction with elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations generally increase yield levels, N uptake and water productivity, risks associated with higher N leaching due to increased precipitation are a challenge for the sustainability of crop production. Overall, different SI options affected the sustainability indicators studied more than future projected climate, strongly suggesting that there is a large potential for sustainably intensifying crop production in northern conditions, particularly when applying more than one intensification measure at a time. Among a wide set of SI options tested for their sustainability impacts, improved crop cultivars showed the firmest positive impacts. This was supported by the views of agricultural stakeholders in the region. SIGNIFICANCE: While the agricultural stakeholder's suggestions for alternative SI options challenged the simulation approach to some extent, the simulations provided robust information for comparing the sustainability impacts of alternative measures. © 2021 The Author(s)","Adaptation; Crop simulation; Grain nitrogen content; Leaching; Water productivity; Yield","agricultural intensification; agricultural management; alternative agriculture; carbon dioxide; cereal; climate change; crop production; cropping practice; future prospect; stakeholder; sustainability; Finland",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103392475

Samples were taken for five to eight hours, depending on school hours, to obtain a monthly sample for each school. The main goal of this study is to assess the differences depending on the type of location and the sampling point to be able to design corrective measures that improve the habitability and safety of the teaching spaces analyzed. The lowest concentrations of fine particulate matter, less than 2.5 μm, were registered at the rural location. The values of these particles found in industrial and urban locations were not substantially different. In the case of particulate matter between 2.5 and 10 μm, significant differences were observed between the three types of locations. The lowest concentrations of particles larger than 10 μm were registered at the rural location, and the highest concentrations were found at the industrial locations. Among the urban stations, the particle concentration of this fraction in station S2 was significantly higher than that in stations S1 and S3, which had similar concentrations. These values are also similar to those registered at school S6, which is at an industrial location.

However, energy recovery from organic waste in the Metropolis of Tunis is still complex. This is due to the city's unpredictable economy, urbanization level, and population growth rates. So far, this unpredictability has constrained access to accurate data about organic waste. This has led to slow progress in harnessing organic waste for renewable energy production. This study focuses on the conversion of the city's organic waste to biogas as a local energy supply. The potential quantity of organic waste and its theoretical energy content were estimated based on a case study in four areas in the Metropolis encompassing 12 municipalities, official records, and literature reviews. The aim of this mixed method was to enhance data quality and optimize the long-term viability of a small-scale biogas plant in the city. The results show that the area generates a considerable amount of organic waste (55–66%) with an annual theoretical energy content of 224.18 GWh. The yearly financial gain from the 25.5 MW biogas plant could reach 40 352 400 USD.

Using long-term measurements of hourly O3 concentrations co-located with NOx concentrations in stations distributed throughout Germany, we assess changes in the climate penalty in summertime, defined as the slope of ozone-temperature relationship during the period 1999–2018. We find a stronger temperature sensitivity in the urban stations over the southwestern regions, especially in the first period of the study (1999–2008). We show a decrease in the climate penalty in most of stations during the second period of the study (2009–2018), with some exceptions (e.g. Berlin) where the climate penalty did not show significant changes. A key motivation of this study is to provide further insights into the impacts of NOx reductions in the O3-temperature relationship. For that, we propose a statisti-cal approach based on Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) to describe ozone production rates, inferred from hourly observations, as a function of NOx and temperature, among other variables relevant during the O3 production. The GAMs confirm lower O3 production rates during the second period (2009–2018) at most of the stations and a decreasing sensitivity to temperature. We observe that a large number of stations are transitioning to NOx-limited chemistry, consistent with a decreasing temperature dependence of O3 at moderate-high temperatures as a result of sustained NOx reductions. Moreover, the GAMs results showed changes in the shape of the function representing the O3-temperature relationship when comparing the first and second period, which suggest changes in VOC influencing the temperature dependence of O3. From these results, we infer effective VOC reductions over time that have also contributed to the observed decrease of O3 production rates. Thus, our analysis indicates that emissions reductions have been effective in a number of stations, particularly in the southwestern regions. However, we notice that in a few stations (e.g. Berlin) additional emission reductions should be required to effectively mitigate the temperature dependence of O3. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate penalty; GAMs; Surface ozone; Temperature dependence","Emission control; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Climate penalty; Emission reduction; Generalized additive model; NO$-x$; NO$-x$/ reduction; Production rates; Surface ozone; Surface ozone concentrations; Temperature dependence; Tropospheric ozone; Temperature distribution; nitrogen oxide; ozone; emission control; nitric oxide; observational method; ozone; reduction; spatiotemporal analysis; temperature effect; troposphere; volatile element; volatile organic compound; air pollution control; Article; climate; environmental impact; Germany; high temperature; precursor; priority journal; reduction (chemistry); temperature dependence; temperature sensitivity; troposphere",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103307378

In this study, the different effects on water balance and NO3− concentration under three projected climate scenarios - RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5 - are analysed in a water protection area in the Lower Rhine Embayment in Germany. Recharge values were calculated from downscaled precipitation and temperature data for the 21st century in a water budget that considers land use in the evapotranspiration term. Nitrate concentration evolution is estimated using recharge and expected fertilization rates with a lumped-parameter model. In order to be able to map the NO3− concentration, the investigation area is divided into 1000 × 1000 m cells. Each cell is assigned a specific NO3− input and a NO3− degradation capacity. Results show significant variations in NO3− development projected with the different climate scenarios due to different temperatures and consequently actual ET, and precipitation. Nevertheless, nitrate concentrations clearly increase in all projections. The total NO3− mass increases most strongly with RCP 8.5 until 2099 (by 89% compared to 2020) and least with RCP 4.5 (by 50%). Further projections show a 20% reduction in agricultural NO3− input can reduce NO3− concentrations, but insufficiently to comply with drinking water guidelines in all regions and aquifers. The model indicates that NO3− input loads should be defined according to future recharge variations governed by climate change. Consequently, a time-varying fertilization rate specific for each region, with their own turnover time and degradation rate, must be estimated to meet pollution environmental goals. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; Groundwater pollution; Modelling; Nitrate; Water balance projection","Agricultural robots; Aquifers; Budget control; Climate models; Degradation; Groundwater resources; Hydrogeology; Land use; Nitrates; Potable water; Water pollution; Alluvial aquifers; Climate change scenarios; Climate scenarios; Degradation capacity; Different effects; Fertilization rates; Lumped parameter modeling; Nitrate concentration; Climate change; ground water; nitrate; aquifer pollution; climate change; concentration (composition); degradation; forecasting method; nitrate; recharge; twenty first century; water budget; aquifer; Article; catchment area (hydrology); climate change; environmental temperature; evapotranspiration; forecasting; Germany; land use; precipitation; priority journal; Germany; Lower Rhine Embayment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099442925

The Paris Agreement sets out a global framework whose implementation relates to all human activities and is commonly guided by the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs), which set the scene for sustainable development performance configuring all climate action related policies. Fast control of CO2 emissions necessarily involves cities since they are responsible for 70 percent of greenhouse gas emissions. SDG 11 (Sustainable cities and communities) is clearly involved in the deployment of SDG 13 (Climate Action). European Sustainability policies are financially guided by the European Green Deal for a climate neutral urban environment. In turn, a common framework for urban policy impact assessment must be based on architectural design tools, such as building certifi-cation, and common data repositories for standard digital building models. Many Neighbourhood Sustainability Assessment (NSA) tools have been developed but the growing availability of open data repositories for cities, together with big-data sources (provided through Internet of Things reposito-ries), allow accurate neighbourhood simulations, or in other words, digital twins of neighbourhoods. These digital twins are excellent tools for policy impact assessment. After a careful analysis of current scientific literature, this paper provides a generic approach for a simple neighbourhood model developed from building physical parameters which meets relevant assessment requirements, while simultaneously being updated (and tested) against real open data repositories, and how this assessment is related to building certification tools. The proposal is validated by real data on energy consumption and on its application to the Benicalap neighbourhood in Valencia (Spain). © 2021 by the authors.

Discharge of excessive nutrients and carbon in untreated animal manure can lead to greenhouse gas emissions and eutrophication concerns, and treatment efforts can be expensive for small scale farmers in marginalized communities. To address this growing concerns, the environmental and economic sustainability of four animal manure management scenarios in Costa Rica: (1) no treatment, (2) biodigesters, (3) biodigesters and struvite precipitation, and (4) biodigesters, struvite precipitation, and lagoons, were investigated. Life cycle assessment was used to assess the carbon footprint and eutrophication potential, while life cycle cost analysis was used to evaluate the equivalent uniform annual worth over the construction and operation and maintenance life stages. Recovery of biogas as a cooking fuel and recovery of nutrients from the struvite reactor reduced the carbon footprint, leading to carbon offsets of up to 2500 kg CO2 eq/yr. Offsets were primarily due to avoiding methane emissions during energy recovery. Eutrophication potential decreased as resource recovery processes were integrated due to improved phosphorus removal in effluent waters. Resource recovery efforts resulted in equivalent uniform annual benefits of $825 to $1056/yr, which could provide a helpful revenue source for lower-income farmers.","anaerobic digestion; developing communities; life cycle assessment; life cycle cost analysis; resource recovery; struvite precipitation","carbon; magnesium; methane; phosphorus; propane; struvite; agricultural worker; anaerobic digestion; animal experiment; Article; carbon footprint; controlled study; cost benefit analysis; Costa Rica; energy recovery; energy yield; environmental sustainability; eutrophication; food industry; hydropower; life cycle assessment; manure; nitrous oxide emission; nonhuman; outcome assessment; practice guideline; precipitation; recycling; sewage effluent; sustainable agriculture",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107371721

In an attempt to control its spread and reduce its health impacts, several countries including those in the African continent imposed restrictive measures that was termed “lockdown”. The outcomes of this lockdown have been reported to be beneficial to air quality worldwide. The main objective of this study is to assess the impact of lockdown due to COVID-19 on nitrogen dioxide (NO2) levels over six major cities in Nigeria. Maps extracted from satellite (Sentinel-5P) were used to indicate the significant reduction in the level of NO2 in the selected cities in Nigeria during two time-intervals, pre-lockdown (December, 2019) and during lockdown (April, 2020). The results show a significant reduction in NO2 levels during the lockdown period compared with its levels during the pre-lockdown period in 2019. The reduction in NO2 concentration levels during lockdown is likely due to less traffic, social distancing and restrictions on business and human activities. There could be an element of uncertainty in the results due to seasonality, as the comparison is done with a different season. However, the magnitude of change due to lockdown is probably much higher than the seasonal variability. Although COVID-19 has negatively impacted the health and economic status of all regions worldwide, it has benefited some aspects of air quality in most countries including Nigeria. This indicates that anthropogenic activities may be managed to reduce air pollution and positively impact the health of human beings.

The Pirabas Formation from the Aricuru outcrop (Pará State) is a shallow-water mixed siliciclastic-carbonate deposit, comprising highly bioturbated wackestone and packstone. However, the impact of these biogenic structures on the reservoir quality of this formation has been overlooked. Here, our results show that pervasive Thalassinoides penetrating the rock matrix, result in remarkably improved porosity and permeability, thus, turning the Pirabas Formation in extremely favorable strata for fluid flow and storage. Since these bioturbated layers are likely to be common in the sub-surface counterparts of this formation, the hydrocarbon potential of these deposits is probably higher than previously expected. Also, considering that the offshore basins of Northern Brazil are directly related to the breakup of the African and American plates during Aptian-Albian, the exploratory interest in the correlated Guinea Gulf (Jubilee play) and French Guiana-Suriname Basin (Zaedyus play) need to be reconsidered.

Consequently, the validation of effective tools for the control of the associated environmental pressures, without hindering economic growth, is strongly needed. Nowadays, senso-instrumental methods by using Instrumental Odour Emissions Systems (IOMSs) is among the most attractive tool for the continuous monitoring of environmental odours, allowing the possibility of obtaining real-time information to support the decision-making process and proactive approach. The systems complexity and scarcity of real data limited their wider full-scale employment. The study presents an advanced prototype of IOMS for the continuous classification and quantification of the odours emitted in ambient air by complex industrial plants, to continuously control the plants emissions with backwards approach. The IOMS device was designed and optimized and included the system for the automatic control of the conditions inside the measurement chamber. The designed operational procedures were presented and discussed. Results highlighted the influence of temperature and air flow rate for the measurement repeatability. Accurate prediction model was created and optimized and resulted able to distinguish 3 different industrial odour sources with accuracy approximately equal to 96%. The models were optimized thanks to the software features, which allowed to automatically apply the designed statistical procedures on the identified dataset with different pre-processing approach. The usefulness of having a fully-developed and user-friendly flexible system that allowed to select and automatically compare different settings options, including the different feature extraction methods, was demonstrated in order to identify the best prediction model. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental odour; Odour classification; Smart city; Training procedure; Validation procedure","Automation; Continuous time systems; Decision making; Economics; Feature extraction; Flow rate; Industrial plants; Monitoring; Odors; Predictive analytics; Real time systems; Continuous monitoring; Decision making process; Environmental pressures; Feature extraction methods; Instrumental methods; Measurement repeatability; Operational procedures; Real-time information; Industrial emissions; airflow; ambient air; automation; classification; complexity; data processing; design; extraction method; monitoring system; odor; software; airflow; ambient air; article; employment; feature extraction; measurement repeatability; odor; prediction; software; environmental monitoring; gas; industry; temperature; fragrance; Environmental Monitoring; Gases; Manufacturing and Industrial Facilities; Odorants; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100516749

In this contribution, we used multiple indicators to assess the impact of intense oil-related activities on coral reefs in two near-by impacted and non-impacted islands in the northwestern Persian Gulf. The efficacy of indices was assessed using estimations of the effect size (omega-squared), precision, and decision trees (Classification and Regression Tree (CART)). The results demonstrated that the combination of bioaccumulation of ƩPAH in coral tissues, the percent of live coral cover, and the Sediment Constituent (SEDCON) Index were the most robust proxies reflecting the influence of human activities on reef's health. Based on sedimentary PAH concentration, the CART classified most of the indicators into two classes consisting of those in impacted and those in non-impacted locations, further supporting the feasibility of the employed indices. The findings of this study provided a warning of degradation in coral reefs of the island subjected to PAH pollution. This encourages decision-makers to execute routine monitoring and mitigation practices to maintain healthy reefs in the study areas. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Bioindicator; Classification and Regression Tree (CART); Impact assessment; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs); Sediment Constituent Index","Biochemistry; Decision making; Decision trees; Ecosystems; Forestry; Health; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Anthropogenic activity; Classification and regression tree; Coral reef ecosystems; Ecological functions; Management efforts; Multiple indicators; Petroleum hydrocarbons; Routine monitoring; Reefs; environmental marker; petroleum derivative; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; hydrocarbon; petroleum; bioaccumulation; coral reef; decision making; ecosystem function; estimation method; human activity; management practice; mitigation; precision; risk assessment; sediment chemistry; Article; bioaccumulation; concentration (parameter); controlled study; coral reef; decision tree; degradation; effect size; human activities; particle size; Persian Gulf; sediment; symbiont; water contamination; analysis; animal; coral reef; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; human; Indian Ocean; toxicity; water pollutant; Arabian Sea; Indian Ocean; Persian Gulf; Animals; Coral Reefs; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Hydrocarbons; Indian Ocean; Petroleum; Water Pollutants, Chemical",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100145924

This study presents a concise view of biodiesel combustion in mitigating pollutant emissions which are generated by the combustion of fossil fuels, thereby eliminating the negative effects on human health and the environment. Gaseous pollutants such as carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and carbon dioxide are found to be major exhaust emissions from vehicles running on fossil fuels. Excessive exposure to these pollutants was found to be a precursor to reductions in life expectancy via health complications in humans. Greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector were found to be 24% of total annual emissions, 74.5% of which came from the combustion of fossil fuel in road vehicles. Biodiesel combustion in vehicular engines is established to be a control technology in reducing gaseous pollutants toward building a sustainable and healthy human–environment scenario. The emissions reduction index from the United States National Biodiesel Board showed that the combustion of biodiesel wholly as a transportation fuel decreased total hydrocarbons, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, carbon, and sulfur emissions by 67%, 80%, 48%, and 100%, respectively. Evaluation of emission results from topical literature strongly suggests that the use of biodiesel is effective in the reduction in pollutants, which is beneficial to human and environmental sustainability. © 2021 by the authors.

However, large-scale fLULCC is not directly measurable and has to be inferred from models instead, such as semi-empirical bookkeeping models and process-based dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). By definition, fLULCC estimates are not directly comparable between these two different model types. As an important example, DGVM-based fLULCC in the annual global carbon budgets is estimated under transient environmental forcing and includes the socalled loss of additional sink capacity (LASC). The LASC results from the impact of environmental changes on land carbon storage potential of managed land compared to potential vegetation and accumulates over time, which is not captured in bookkeeping models. The fLULCC from transient DGVM simulations, thus, strongly depends on the timing of land use and land cover changes mainly because LASC accumulation is cut off at the end of the simulated period. To estimate the LASC, the fLULCC from pre-industrial DGVM simulations, which is independent of changing environmental conditions, can be used. Additionally, DGVMs using constant present-day environmental forcing enable an approximation of bookkeeping estimates. Here, we analyse these three DGVM-derived fLULCC estimations (under transient, pre-industrial, and present-day forcing) for 12 models within 18 regions and quantify their differences as well as climate-and CO2-induced components and compare them to bookkeeping estimates. Averaged across the models, we find a global fLULCC (under transient conditions) of 2:00:6 PgC yr1 for 2009-2018, of which 40% are attributable to the LASC (0:80:3 PgC yr1). From 1850 onward, the fLULCC accumulated to 18956 PgC with 4015 PgC from the LASC. Around 1960, the accumulating nature of the LASC causes global transient fLULCC estimates to exceed estimates under presentday conditions, despite generally increased carbon stocks in the latter. Regional hotspots of high cumulative and annual LASC values are found in the USA, China, Brazil, equatorial Africa, and Southeast Asia, mainly due to deforestation for cropland. Distinct negative LASC estimates in Europe (early reforestation) and from 2000 onward in the Ukraine (recultivation of post-Soviet abandoned agricultural land), indicate that fLULCC estimates in these regions are lower in transient DGVM compared to bookkeeping approaches. Our study unravels the strong dependence of fLULCC estimates on the time a certain land use and land cover change event happened to occur and on the chosen time period for the forcing of environmental conditions in the underlying simulations. We argue for an approach that provides an accounting of the fLULCC that is more robust against these choices, for example by estimating a mean DGVM ensemble fLULCC and LASC for a defined reference period and homogeneous environmental changes (CO2 only). © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

However, combining the policies of introducing autonomous vehicles with the implementation of electric vehicles and using the P&R system could amplify the decrease of transport sector emissions. The COPERT software has been used to calculate the emissions. This article aims to study these policies and determine which combinations can better reduce pollution. The result shows that each combination of autonomous vehicles reduces pollution to different degrees. In conclusion, the shift to more sustainable transport modes through autonomous electric vehicles and P&R systems reduces pollution in the urban environment to a higher percentage. In contrast, the combination of autonomous vehicles has lower emission reduction but is easier to implement with the currently available infrastructure. © 2021 by the authors.

However, a lack of efficient catalysts is a barrier for promoting this technology to an industrial scale. Here, we report a new catalytic system using a composite catalyst containing In2O3/SAPO-34 and Fe-Co/K-Al2O3 to enhance the light olefins yield. The effect of catalysts bed configuration including a physical mixture of In2O3/SAPO-34 with Fe-Co/K-Al2O3 (M-InS/Fe-Co), a dual-layer packing of In2O3/SAPO-34 followed by Fe-Co/K-Al2O3 (T-InS/B-FeCo) and a dual-layer packing of Fe-Co/K-Al2O3 above In2O3/SAPO-34 (T-FeCo/B-InS) is investigated. The M-InS/Fe-Co and T-FeCo/B-InS catalysts show a light olefins yield of 11.5 and 16.2% which are lower than that (18.9%) of the single Fe-Co/K-Al2O3 catalyst. A drastic reduction in the BET surface area (42 m2 g−1) of M-InS/Fe-Co catalyst compared to its theoretical value of 198 m2 g−1 is observed, suggesting the pores blockage. The T-InS/B-FeCo composite catalyst achieves a state-of the art light olefins yield of 21.5% due to a selective CO2 conversion to light olefins over In2O3/SAPO-34 and a highly active CO2 conversion to hydrocarbon over Fe-Co/K-Al2O3 which further converts the remaining CO2 from the former catalyst bed to light olefins and other hydrocarbon products until equilibrium CO2 conversion is reached. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Catalysts bed configuration; CO2 hydrogenation; Fe-based catalysts; In2O3/SAPO-34; Light olefins","Aluminum compounds; Carbon dioxide; Catalysts; Iron compounds; Light olefins; CO2 hydrogenation; Composite catalysts; Effect of catalyst; Efficient catalysts; Hydrocarbon product; Light olefins yield; Physical mixtures; Theoretical values; Indium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100564197

Climate change has triggered multiple abiotic stresses in plants that are the main causes of crop loss worldwide, reducing average yield for most crops by more than 50%. Although millets are tolerant to most abiotic stresses including drought and high temperatures, further improvement is needed to make them more resilient to unprecedented effects of climate change and associated environmental stresses. Incorporation of stress tolerance traits in millets will improve their productivity in marginal environments and will help in overcoming future food shortage due to climate change. Recently, approaches such as application of plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPRs) have been used to improve growth and development, as well as stress tolerance of crops. Moreover, with the advance of next-generation sequencing technology, genome editing, using the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR/Cas9) system are increasingly used to develop stress tolerant varieties in different crops. In this paper, the innate ability of millets to tolerate abiotic stresses and alternative approaches to boost stress resistance were thoroughly reviewed. Moreover, several stress-resistant genes were identified in related monocots such as rice (Oryza sativa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and maize (Zea mays), and other related species for which orthologs in millets could be manipulated by CRISPR/Cas9 and related genome-editing techniques to improve stress resilience and productivity. These cutting-edge alternative strategies are expected to bring this group of orphan crops at the forefront of scientific research for their potential contribution to global food security. © 2021 by the authors.

Due to the high content of iron in the form of oxides, it is an attractive material for the recovery of metallic iron by reduction. The product of mill scale reduction is an iron with a very extended surface and a high affinity for oxygen. The smaller iron particles are, the easier it is for spontaneous rapid oxidation, which can be linked to pyrophoricity. This article presents results of experiments using the TG/DTA thermal analysis method aimed at verifying the possibility of recovering iron from the mill scale by a reduction with carbon monoxide at 850 °C, 950 °C, and 1050 °C, taking into account the phenomenon of secondary oxidation in contact with oxygen from air at temperatures of 300 °C, 350 °C, and 400 °C.

We examined the cumulative effects of logging, roads, land-use change, fire, and bark beetle outbreaks on future habitat for olive-sided flycatcher (Contopus cooperi), a steeply declining aerial insectivorous songbird, in Canada’s western boreal forest. To predict the occurrence of olive-sided flycatcher we developed a suite of habitat suitability models using point count surveys (1997–2011) spatially- and temporally-matched with forest inventory data. Flycatcher occurrence was positively associated with small (∼10 ha) 10- to 20-year-old clearcuts, and with 10–100% tree mortality due to mountain pine beetle (Dendroctonus ponderosae) outbreaks, but we found no association with roads or distance to water. We used the parameter estimates from the best-fit habitat suitability models to inform spatially explicit state-and-transition simulation models to project change in habitat availability from 2020 to 2050 under six alternative scenarios (three management × two fire alternatives). The simulation models projected that the cumulative effects of land use conversion, forest harvesting, and fire will reduce the area of olive-sided flycatcher habitat by 16–18% under Business As Usual management scenarios and by 11–13% under scenarios that include protection of 30% of the land base. Scenarios limiting the size of all clearcuts to ≤10 ha resulted in a median habitat loss of 4–6%, but projections were highly variable. Under all three management alternatives, a 50% increase in fire frequency (expected due to climate change) exacerbated habitat loss. The projected losses of habitat in western boreal forest, even with an increase in protected areas, imply that reversing the ongoing population declines of olive-sided flycatcher and other migratory birds will require attention to forest management beyond protected areas. Further work should examine the effects of multiple stressors on the demographic mechanisms driving change in aerial insectivore populations, including stressors on the wintering grounds in South America, and should aim to adapt the design of protected areas and forest management policies to projected climate-driven increases in the size and frequency of wildfires. © Copyright © 2021 Norris, Frid, Debyser, De Groot, Thomas, Lee, Dohms, Robinson, Easton, Martin and Cockle.","aerial insectivore; bark beetle outbreak; clearcut logging; climate change; cumulative effects; habitat suitability; landscape simulation; wildfire",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107046265

Emission factors for LDVs and HDVs were calculated using a carbon balance method, the pollutants considered including nitrogen oxides (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO), and sulfur dioxide, as well as carbon dioxide and ethanol. From 2001 to 2018, fleet-average emission factors for LDVs and HDVs, respectively, were found to decrease by 4.9 and 5.1% per year for CO and by 5.5 and 4.2% per year for NOx. These reductions demonstrate that regulations for vehicle emissions adopted in Brazil in the last 30 years improved air quality in the megacity of São Paulo significantly, albeit with a clear delay. These findings, especially those for CO, indicate that official emission inventories underestimate vehicle emissions. Here, we demonstrated that the adoption of emission factors calculated under real-world conditions can dramatically improve air quality modeling in the region. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","biofuel; gasohol; heavy-duty vehicles; light-duty vehicles; vehicle emission factor","Air quality; Biodiesel; Carbon dioxide; Carbon monoxide; Ethanol; Ethanol fuels; Fleet operations; Nitrogen oxides; Sulfur dioxide; Air quality modeling; Emission inventories; Emission measurement; Heavy duty vehicles; Light duty vehicles; Multiple traffics; Tunnel measurements; Vehicle emission factors; Light weight vehicles; alcohol; biodiesel; biofuel; carbon dioxide; carbon monoxide; gasoline; nitrogen oxide; sulfur dioxide; biofuel; gasoline; nitrogen oxide; biofuel; megacity; numerical model; traffic emission; tunnel; air pollutant; air quality; Article; Brazil; carbon balance; circadian rhythm; city; diesel engine; exhaust gas; government regulation; greenhouse gas; motor vehicle; public policy; reduction (chemistry); time series analysis; travel; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; Brazil; Sao Paulo [Brazil]; Air Pollutants; Biofuels; Brazil; Environmental Monitoring; Gasoline; Motor Vehicles; Nitrogen Oxides; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106460187

High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed that the total flavonoid content in LBLF was 322.0 mg/g, of which the rutin content was 297.6 mg/g. The effect of 0.5%, 1.0%, and 1.5% LBLF on the structure and thermodynamic properties of MP in minced mutton was studied systematically. Tyrosine and tryptophan of MP samples treated with LBLF were converted from an exposed state to an embedded state. The interaction between LBLF and MP quenched the internal fluorescence, and improved the thermal stability of MP. The addition of LBLF significantly reduced the carbonyl and sulfhydryl contents of MP (p < 0.05), and decreased the surface hydrophobicity of MP in a dose-dependent manner. Our results indicate that LBLF can combine with free radicals produced by protein oxidation, block the free radical oxidation chain reaction, and inhibit the oxidation of MP. Therefore, LBLF may have great potential as a natural antioxidant in meats and meat products during chilled storage. Practical Application: Lycium barbarum is widely distributed in China, especially in Qinghai and Ningxia. The results of this study suggest that flavonoids extracted from L. barbarum leaves may be an effective natural antioxidant for the preservation of meats and meat products. © 2021 Institute of Food Technologists®","flavonoid; Lycium barbarum leaf; minced mutton; myofibrillar protein; protein oxidation","antioxidant; flavonoid; muscle protein; rutoside; animal; chemistry; China; cold; drug effect; food storage; isolation and purification; Lycium; meat; muscle fibril; oxidation reduction reaction; plant leaf; procedures; red meat; sheep; Animals; Antioxidants; China; Cold Temperature; Flavonoids; Food Storage; Lycium; Meat Products; Muscle Proteins; Myofibrils; Oxidation-Reduction; Plant Leaves; Red Meat; Rutin; Sheep",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104720235

Infrastructure is continuously built on these problematic soil areas, making it crucial to study the impact of external factors on the engineering properties of subgrade soil. This paper proposes a test device by which a few physical conditions (salt content and temperature) can be controlled and the mechanics parameters (deformation and resilient modulus) of soil samples can be dynamically investigated. Using the proposed device, the resilient moduli of the samples collected from an in-situ highway project on different wetting–drying and salt washing–supplying paths were measured and analyzed. The results indicate that, for the same final moisture content, the modulus value of a soil sample subjected to the drying → wetting path is larger than that of a soil sample subjected to the wetting → drying path. Further, the resilient modulus of soil samples is weakened after multiple wetting–drying cycles, while the stiffness of soil samples obtained from high soluble salt content is lower than that of soil samples with the same initial soluble salt content. Finally, the proposed device is simple and convenient to use and provides a reliable method for exploring the mechanism of mechanical behavior degradation of saline and loess soils and the subgrade settlement in problematical soil areas. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Mechanical behavior degradation; Resilient modulus; Salt washing–supplying; Simulation experiment","climate change; numerical model; soil degradation; soil mechanics; stiffness; subgrade; wetting-drying cycle",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104932958

Nevertheless, only a few systems have been reported so far by applying solar energy in visible light region in particular high wavelength (such as λ ≥ 650 nm). Herein, we report an efficient 650 nm-induced CO2 photocatalytic reduction system to syngas by introducing Co into MgAl-layered double hydroxide (CoMgAl-LDH) nanosheets in conjunction with Ru(bpy)3]Cl2·6H2O as photosensitizer, in which [Ru(bpy)3]Cl2·6H2O could be activated to generate photogenerated electrons which further transfer to surface of CoMgAl-LDH for CO2 reduction. Under irradiation &gt;400 nm, the CoMgAl-LDH nanosheets showed excellent CO2 conversion with TOF of 11.57 h−1, 3 times higher than that of CoAl-LDH. Most importantly, up to monochromatic irradiation wavelength at 650 nm, the CoMgAl-LDH nanosheets still displayed optimized syngas evolution rate, with CO rate of 0.35 μmol·h−1 with quantum yield of 0.86%.

The obligation potentially affects the performance of oil-fired power plants (PLTD) and gas engine power plants (PLTMG) that are common power plant technologies used by the State-owned Electricity Company (PLN) in remote and disadvantaged areas. The objective of this study is to estimate effects of B30 usage on performance and emissions of PLTD and PLTMG. We compare performance and emission data of 3 (three) power plants before and after using B30. The results show that the uses of B30 increases spesific fuel consumption (SFC) by 0.009 L/kWh in PLTD and by 0.0071 L/kWh in PLTMG. The uses of B30 will reduce emissions of SO2, CO, and particulate matter, except NOx emission. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Biodiesel; Biomass; Electric power generation; Gas engines; Mineral industry; Mineral resources; Sulfur dioxide; Electricity companies; Engine power; Indonesia; NOx emissions; Particulate Matter; Performance and emissions; Power plant technology; Power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107210811

The size and temperatures of the spots are determined by means of photographs and an optical pyrometer. The composition of the plasma in the anode spot region is calculated. The cylindrical crucible 100 mm in diameter with an axial hole 40 mm in diameter and 28 mm in depth is rotated at the speed of ~100 rpm. A cylindrical cathode 50 mm in diameter has an axial channel 24 mm in diameter. Argon is fed through the channel as a plasma-forming gas. The crucible and cathode are located in a steel water-cooled chamber with a volume of 150 L. The arc is several centimeters long and the arc current is 560–630 A. It is shown experimentally that an argon plasma arc at a power of 23–25 kW can form a contracted or diffuse anode spot. The current density of the contracted spot is 1800 A/cm2, while that of the diffuse spot is ~250 A/cm2. A contracted spot is formed on the cold crucible and it is accompanied by intense evaporation of graphite in the region of the spot. The carbon vapor reduces the plasma ionization potential near the anode and promotes contraction. Uniform heating of the crucible of up to 2700 K is needed for transformation of the contracted spot into a diffuse one. Such heating is attained by rotation of the crucible. Thermal isolation of the crucible also promotes the formation of a diffuse spot. The Poisson equation is solved, and the near-anode potentials in the space charge layer are calculated for contracted and diffuse spots as 10.7 and 1.5 V, respectively. It is assumed that the decrease in the near-anode potential in the diffuse regime promotes its formation. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Ltd.","anode; arc; crucible; graphite; plasma; potential; rotation; spot","Anodes; Argon; Cathodes; Graphite; Ionization of gases; Ionization potential; Poisson equation; Pyrometers; Anode potential; Graphite crucibles; Optical pyrometers; Plasma forming gas; Space charge layers; Thermal isolation; Uniform heating; Water-cooled chambers; Crucibles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107600777

A key question that we attempt to answer in this study is which, if any, of these measures can be productively encouraged post-lockdown in efforts to sustain at least part of this reduction in emissions. Sweden is uniquely suited for our study because the voluntary nature of lockdown in Sweden allowed us to assess the level of compliance to recommendations and its effects on greenhouse gas emissions. First, we assessed the change of perceived quality of life (QOL) among 746 individuals from Stockholm region due to adhering to lockdown measures. Second, we calculated the associated change of annual per capita greenhouse emissions. We found that avoiding travel for work, avoiding purchasing, and avoiding restaurants had the least negative effect on QOL, and at the same time the largest positive effect on carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) emission reductions. We conclude that these are potential leverage points for stimulating behavioral change that has a positive climatic impact. © 2021. The Authors.

However, culture – the ideas, norms, and objects that a society shares – affects consumption decisions. Excluding this cultural context may limit consideration of potentially successful policy interventions. The research presented here statistically tests the impact of religious culture on rural car ownership in the United States by incorporating religious adherence rates into statistical models of countywide motorization rates. This research explores whether religious affiliation is a statistically significant predictor of car ownership and whether the addition of those religious variables results in a statistically significant improvement in model fit. The findings suggest that religious affiliation, expressed as countywide adherence rates, is a statistically significant predictor of car ownership and that its inclusion improves model fit; however, while statistically significant, that improvement in model fit is quite small. This research concludes that considering culture is a valuable direction for targeting car consumption policies aimed at curbing climate change. This research also demonstrates the need for additional exploration using disaggregated cultural data to better understand the import of this approach to policy development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Car ownership; Culture; Religion; Rural; Travel behavior","car ownership; car use; policy development; religion; rural population; rural transport; transportation policy; travel behavior; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104436760

While the status and trends of national forest monitoring capacities have been previously assessed for the tropics, this has not been systematically done worldwide. In this paper, we assess the use and quality of forest monitoring data sources for national reporting to the FRA in 236 countries and territories. More specifically, we (a) analyze the use of remote sensing (RS) for forest area monitoring and the use of national forest inventory (NFI) for monitoring forest area, growing stock, biomass, carbon stock, and other attributes in FRA 2005-2020, (b) assess data quality in FRA 2020 using FAO tier-based indicators, and (c) zoom in to investigate changes in tropical forest monitoring capacities in FRA 2010-2020. Globally, the number of countries monitoring forest area using RS at good to very good capacities increased from 55 in FRA 2005 to 99 in FRA 2020. Likewise, the number of countries with good to very good NFI capacities increased from 48 in FRA 2005 to 102 in FRA 2020. This corresponds to ∼85% of the global forest area monitored with one or more nationally-produced up-to-date RS products or NFI in FRA 2020. For large proportions of global forests, the highest quality data was used in FRA 2020 for reporting on forest area (93%), growing stock (85%), biomass (76%), and carbon pools (61%). Overall, capacity improvements are more widespread in the tropics, which can be linked to continued international investments for forest monitoring especially in the context of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in tropical countries (REDD+). More than 50% of the tropical countries with targeted international support improved both RS and NFI capacities in the period 2010-2020 on top of those that already had persistent good to very good capabilities. There is also a link between improvements in national capacities and improved governance measured against worldwide governance indicators (WGI). Our findings - the first global study - suggest an ever-improving data basis for national reporting on forest resources in the context of climate and development commitments, e.g. the Paris Agreement and Sustainable Development Goals. © 2021 The Author(s).

Past energy transitions have typically taken several decades, but policymakers remain confident that low carbon technology can be deployed in time for a 2050 mitigation target. We consider the potential for social transitions to deliver emissions reductions within this time frame. Based on detailed analysis of 12 past transitions, we develop frameworks for technological and social transitions which draw out the relationships between progress, policy and diffusion. Using our generalised frameworks we compare the duration of transitions, finding that the technological transitions in our study take on average four decades longer than the social transitions to go from initial conception to market or behaviour saturation. Our evidence suggests that policymakers who continue to rely on technology transitions to reduce emissions will be unable to deliver climate targets by 2050. By engaging with the public to stimulate social transitions governments could have more impact, more swiftly. Only by utilising both technological and social transitions can policymakers hope to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Energy technology diffusion; Innovation timescales; Net zero; Social change","Climate mitigations; Climate targets; Emissions reduction; Energy transitions; Low-carbon technologies; Technological innovation; Technological transition; Technology transition; Energy policy; climate change; emission control; environmental economics; innovation; social change; state role; technology adoption; technology diffusion",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101778977

However, there have been limited efforts in these countries to understand Water-Energy-GHG nexus for sustainable wastewater treatment. This study evaluates operational energy, total embodied energy and corresponding GHG emissions of a widely implemented municipal wastewater treatment technology in Mumbai Metropolitan Region of India. Data for wastewater inflow, total energy consumption and materials used in the unit processes of the treatment plant were collected and analysed. Direct GHG emissions from the plant were estimated using the method proposed by the intergovernmental panel for climate change (IPCC). The energy embodied within the materials used in the construction and operations of the plant was estimated using country-specific information. The results show that the energy intensity for plant operation and chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal was 0.23 ± 0.05 kWh/m3 of wastewater treated and 1.12 ± 0.77 kWh/kg of COD removed, respectively. The embodied energy in chemicals and building materials during the plant's life cycle contributed 19% of the total embodied energy. Wastewater inflow with specific average energy consumption in wet-well pumping and blowers showed a negative and positive correlation, respectively.

The Urmia Lake Basin has faced environmental, social, and economic challenges in recent years, and this situation is likely to worsen under the impacts of climate change. For this study, an adaptability analysis of this region is proposed for the 2040 horizon year. Two models, the water evaluation and planning (WEAP (Stockholm Environmental Institute, Stockholm, Sweden)) and the low emissions analysis platform (LEAP (Stockholm Environmental Institute, Boston, MA, USA)), are integrated to simulate changes in water, energy, food, and the environment over these 20 years. Two climate scenarios and nine policy scenarios are combined to assess sustainable development using a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach. Results show that, through pursuing challenging goals in agricultural, potable water, energy, and industrial sectors, sustainable development will be achieved. In this scenario, the Lake Urmia water level will reach its ecological water level in 2040. However, social, technical, and political challenges are considered obstacles to implementing the goals of this scenario.

The SCIENCE-Outdoor model was used to simulate changes to sensible heat release and CO2 emissions from buildings yielded by four UHIE countermeasures and five GW countermeasures. This model can evaluate the thermal condition of building envelope surfaces, both inside and outside. The results showed that water-consuming UHIE countermeasures such as evaporative space cooling and roof water showering provided positive effects (decreasing sensible heat release and CO2 emissions related to space conditioning) in summer. Additionally, they had no negative (unwanted cooling) effects in winter since they can be turned off in the heating season. Roof greening can provide the greatest space-conditioning CO2 emissions reductions among four UHIE countermeasures, and it reduces the amount of heat release slightly in the heating season. Since the effect on reducing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by UHIE countermeasures is not very significant, it is desirable to introduce GW countermeasures in order to reduce CO2 emissions. The significance of this study is that it constructed the new simulation model SCIENCE-Outdoor and applied it to show the influence of countermeasures upon both heat release and CO2 emissions. © 2021 by the authors.

This study assessed adaptation priority differences in the Philippines to determine if traditional climate change decision makers accurately represent the marginalized communities they serve. Specifically, this study gathered baseline data of climate change knowledge, compared resiliency priorities and proposed strategies between local government workers and village residents, and analyzed factors that contribute to identify differences. The study's target group (residents of small villages) has historically been marginalized in municipal environmental decision making. Data collected through focus group discussions and interviews demonstrated there was a statistical difference between local government officials who were more likely to propose abstract, systemic adaptation strategies to build social capacity (69% of government officials' proposed strategies), while village residents focused on physical infrastructure (59% of village residents' proposed strategies). A second study outcome was the identification of contributing factors in how Filipinos might propose climate change adaptation strategies: for example, education levels, social or economic class, accessibility to resources, sources of information, and past experience with hazards. The significance of this research is the evidence of climate change adaptation prioritization differences between the country's traditional decision-making group, the municipal government unit, and marginalized members of local villages. The differences show that local municipal government units in the Philippines may not be the most effective base group for bottom-up adaptation and support the need for effective collaboration and community engagement in future climate change planning. © Copyright 2021, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers 2021.","coastal resiliency; ethnographic, sea level rise; small island developing states; social capacity; sustainable development","Decision making; Rural areas; Adaptation strategies; Climate change adaptation; Community engagement; Decision-making groups; Environmental decision making; Government officials; Sources of informations; Statistical differences; Climate change; adult; climate change; controlled study; education; environmental decision making; female; government employee; human; human experiment; interview; male; outcome assessment; Philippines; review; rural population; sea level rise; sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107381087

Ridesharing can reduce the number of vehicles in the street, which consequently can reduce air pollution, traffic congestion, and transportation cost. However, ridesharing organization requires passengers to report sensitive location information about their trips to a trip organizing server (TOS) which creates a serious privacy issue. The existing ridesharing organization schemes are neither flexible nor scalable in the sense that they require a driver and a rider to have exactly the same trip to share a ride, and they are inefficient if applied to large geographic areas. In this paper, we propose two efficient privacy-preserving ridesharing organization schemes for Non-transferable Ridesharing Service (NRS) and Transferable Ridesharing Service (TRS). In NRS, a rider shares a ride from his/her trip's start to the destination with only one driver, whereas, in TRS, a rider can transfer between multiple drivers while en route until he reaches his destination. In the proposed schemes, the ridesharing area is divided into a number of small geographic areas, called cells, and each cell has a unique identifier. Each driver/rider should encrypt his/her trip's data with modified kNN encryption scheme, and send an encrypted ridesharing offer/request to the TOS. In NRS scheme, Bloom filters are used to represent the trip information compactly before encryption. Then, the TOS can measure the similarity of the encrypted trips to organize shared rides without revealing either the users' identities or the locations. In TRS scheme, drivers report their encrypted routes, and then the TOS builds a directed graph that is passed to a modified version of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm to search for an optimal path for rides that can achieve a set of preferences prescribed by the riders. Although TRS can be used to organize non-transferable trips, performance evaluation shows that NRS requires less communication overhead than TRS. Our formal privacy proof and analysis demonstrate that the proposed schemes can preserve users privacy and our experimental results using routes extracted from real maps show that the proposed schemes can be used efficiently for large cities. © 2004-2012 IEEE.","cloud security; non-transferable ridesharing; operations on encrypted data; Privacy preservation; transferable ridesharing","Directed graphs; Graph algorithms; Privacy by design; Traffic congestion; Vehicles; Communication overheads; Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm; Encryption schemes; Location information; Number of vehicles; Privacy preserving; Transportation cost; Unique identifiers; Cryptography",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106181701

The responses of farm households to climate change play a very essential role in addressing the risk of climate change. This study investigated factors influencing adaptation strategies to climate change in the Black Volta Basin of Ghana. Survey questions were administered to 450 households sampled from eight districts using a multistage sampling technique. Out of the six adaptation strategies, four major identified adaptation strategies were subsequently used as the dependent variable in the multivariate (MV) probit and binary logit models. The results revealed that factors such as gender, age, household size, farmer-based-organizations membership, farm income, years of education, districts of location of respondents, farm size and climate change awareness—statistically and significantly—influenced households’ adaptation to the changing climate. However, the positive correlation matrix from the MV probit model showed complementarities among all the adaptation strategies adopted by household heads. Priority should be given to improving household heads’ adaptive capacity. Also, governmental and non-governmental organizations should invest in climate-resilient programmes. Finally, programmes aimed at sensitizing household heads on climate change adaptation strategies such as changing planting time, changing farming methods, and planting early maturing and drought-resistant varieties through pieces of trainings and workshops may be duly supported by the Government; particularly, for household heads in the Black Volta Basin. © 2021, The Author(s).","Adaptation strategies; Black Volta Basin; Climate change; Crop farmers; Logistic regression","Cultivation; Drought; Logistic regression; Adaptation strategies; Binary logit model; Climate change adaptation; Dependent variables; Multistage sampling; Nongovernmental organizations; Positive correlations; Rainfall patterns; Climate change",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104364317

In order to generate such estimates for Chile, weather station data of the Dirección Meteorológica de Chile are used to identify large-scale predictors for local-scale temperature changes and construct individual empirical-statistical models for each station. The geographical coverage of weather stations ranges from Arica in the North to Punta Arenas in the South. Each model is trained in a cross-validated stepwise linear multiple regression procedure based on (24) weather station records and predictor time series derived from ERA-Interim reanalysis data. The time period 1979–2000 is used for training, while independent data from 2001 to 2015 serves as a basis for assessing model performance. The resulting transfer functions for each station are then directly coupled to MPI-ESM simulations for future climate change under emission scenarios RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP 8.5 to estimate the local temperature response until 2100 A.D. Our investigation into predictors for local scale temperature changes support established knowledge of the main drivers of Chilean climate, i.e. a strong influence of the El Niño Southern Oscillation in northern Chile and frontal system-governed climate in central and southern Chile. Temperature downscaling yields high prediction skill scores (ca. 0.8), with highest scores for the mid-latitudes. When forced with MPI-ESM simulations, the statistical models predict local temperature deviations from the 1979–2015 mean that range between − 0.5–2 K, 0.5–3 K and 2–7 K for RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 respectively. © 2021, The Author(s).","Chile; Climate change; Empirical statistical downscaling; Prediction; Statistical modelling","climate change; climate prediction; downscaling; El Nino-Southern Oscillation; numerical model; regional climate; temperature profile; twenty first century; Chile",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099746103

One of the technologies that contributes to this purpose is using solar cooling systems. An example of such systems is Lithium Bromide Absorption Chillers-Driven by Hot Water (LiBr/H2O absorption chillers). These chillers are normally powered by solar collectors (ordinary plate or evacuate tubular), which are widely accessible. This paper includes a review of previous experimental and theoretical studies on the effect of single cooling absorption systems. In addition, new proposals regarding the design of the solar collectors, supporting systems for energy and cooling methods will be provided. Furthermore, the present paper also summarizes the major double influence of the cooling absorption systems, add to the two-stage and half-effect absorption coolers. The influence of double cooling absorption systems using solar power could be considered for the buildings with more cooling capacity requirements, but with structure of space restrictions. However, for these cases is important to consider the direct irradiation, which needs high levels. For dry regions with water shortage, half-absorption and two-stage absorption coolers are more suitable. Solar-powered cooling systems designs should follow and incorporate standard rules based on the characteristics of various areas in order to be applicable on a large scale. © 2021, Journal of Thermal Engineering.

Renewable energy (RE) sources play an important role in the pursuit of these goals, which has been taken into account in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The aim of this article is to describe patterns and trends in the achievements of the energy policy of European Union (EU) countries in the field of renewable energy in sustainable development. The identification of leaders in this field gives the possibility to analyse actions taken by the governments of these countries and the possible implementation of the introduced solutions on the ground of individual Member States at the regional and national levels. At the beginning Main goal of energy policy on the field of renewable energy sources (RES) is to increase production from environmentally friendly sources that is why trends were determined in order to assess the rate of achievement of the national target for changes the share of energy from renewable sources in total gross energy consumption. Groups of similar countries were then identified on the basis of three indicators corresponding to the targets set in the climate and energy package. In the group of analysed countries, 14 have achieved the 2020 targets and 4 have exceeded the 2030 targets. The main renewable energy sources (RES) are biofuels, wind, and hydropower. In the assessment of the achievement of energy policy targets, the best situation was observed in the case of Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom. These countries have significantly increased the share of renewable energy in total energy consumption. Compared to other EU countries, they have reduced the economy’s energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions the most. © 2021 by the authors.

Brunei is not an exception. Prior to the pandemic, the poultry sub sector has performed better than others in the agriculture sector and was reportedly able to meet close to 100% of local demand for eggs and chicken. However there have been shortages of meat products such as chicken, lamb and processed meat in Brunei amidst the pandemic. This paper aims to review the contributing factors of these shortages. Some of the factors identified were increased of demand, cost of logistics, and cost of feed and unstable weather caused by climate change. The government has a big task ahead in not only resolving the immediate shortages but also to manage future risks. Farmers and local livestock producers require greater policy support in order to boost local production and effectively address obstacles along the supply chain in a coordinated manner. Local livestock producers must also continuously improve their competitiveness by learning and adopting new technologies in the field of agriculture not just to meet current demands but also for time to come. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

Key knowledge gaps are related to the potential for evolutionary rescue in response to climate, especially in long-lived clonally reproducing species. We illustrate a novel approach to assess the potential for evolutionary rescue using a combination of reciprocal transplant experiment in the field to assess performance under a changing climate and independent growth chamber assays to assess growth- and physiology-related plant trait maxima and plasticities of the same clones. We use a clonal grass, Festuca rubra, as a model species. We propagated individual clones and used them in a transplant experiment across broad-scale temperature and precipitation gradients, simulating the projected direction of climate change in the region. Independent information on trait maxima and plasticities of the same clones was obtained by cultivating them in four growth chambers representing climate extremes. Plant survival was affected by interaction between plant traits and climate change, with both trait plasticities and maxima being important for adaptation to novel climates. Key traits include plasticity in extravaginal ramets, aboveground biomass, and osmotic potential. The direction of selection in response to a given climatic change detected in this study mostly contradicted the natural trait clines indicating that short-term selection pressure as identified here does not match long-term selection outcomes. Long-lived clonal species exposed to different climatic changes are subjected to consistent selection pressures on key traits, a necessary condition for adaptation to novel conditions. This points to evolutionary rescue as an important mechanism for dealing with climate change in these species. Our experimental approach may be applied also in other model systems broadening our understanding of evolutionary rescue. Such knowledge cannot be easily deduced from observing the existing field clines. © Copyright © 2021 Münzbergová, Vandvik and Hadincová.","alpine ecosystems; clonal species; rapid evolution; reciprocal transplant experiment; trait selection",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107041824

This unsustained water provision is drastically affecting the areas of limited water resources. This research has studied the impacts of climate change on water availability and the localized indigenous technique of glacier grafting for sustained water provision. This adaptation strategy helps the water-stressed locality to conserve water for food security. For this reason, 160 self-administered questionnaires were deployed at the household level, and the primary data were analyzed through STATA Software for ordinal logit regression to estimate the results for both restricted and unrestricted models, against the three dependent variables of glacier grafting, glacier melt water and food security. It is found that glacier grafting ensures sustained water provision for irrigation. It increases fertile land and agricultural production to achieve food security. The income of the households from non-/agricultural products leads to afford a better standard of living. The extension of the glacier grafting strategy to curb climatic effects can help global societies to address the food insecurity issue for sustained living. © 2021 by the authors.

Millions of premature deaths each year are attributed to exposure to ambient particulate matter (PM). We quantified health and economic impacts from long-term exposure to ambient PM2.5 in the population of Thailand for 2016. We collected data on ambient PM2.5 concentrations from automatic monitoring stations across Thailand over 1996-2016. We used historic exposure to PM2.5 to estimate the mortality in each province from lower respiratory infections (LRIs), stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, and ischaemic heart disease, and also assessed diabetes mortality, as well as incident cases of dementia and Parkinson's disease, in supplementary analyses. We applied risk estimates from the Global Exposure Mortality Model to calculate attributable mortality and quantify disability-adjusted life years (DALYs); we based economic costs on the value of a statistical life (VSL). We calculated 50 019 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 42 189-57 849) deaths and 508 918 (95% CI: 438 345-579 492) DALYs in 2016 attributed to long-term PM2.5 exposure in Thailand. Population attributable fractions ranged from 20% (95% CI: 10% to 29%) for stroke to 48% (95% CI: 27% to 63%) for LRIs. Based on the VSL, we calculated a cost of US$ 60.9 billion (95% CI: US$ 51.3-70.4 billion), which represents nearly 15% of Thailand's gross domestic product in 2016. While progress has been made to reduce exposure to ambient PM2.5 in Thailand, continued reductions based on stricter regulatory limits for PM2.5 and other air pollutants would help prolong life, and delay, or prevent, onset of cardiorespiratory and other diseases. © 2021 The Author(s).

The stochastic cyclic variations of the combustion can be successfully compensated by the adjustment of the fuel injection pulses within the same cycle. The feedback information and controllability obtained relies on the different operating conditions, emissions regulations and fuels. Various in-cycle closed-loop combustion controllers are found in the literature to overcome the numerous challenges of the combustion control. In this paper, the modularization for the controller design and their integration is investigated, and how the transition between the available information, control actions and control strategy affects the final combustion behaviour. The approach consists in the design of a finite-state machine that supervises the transition between virtual sensors and measurements, regulators and the possibility of additional fuel injections. The proposed approach was tested in a Scania D13 engine for a wide-range of operating conditions. The results confirm the improved controllability and reduced steady-state RMSE of the controlled parameters, with a smoother transition between set-points, regardless of operating conditions and fuel. © 2021 American Automatic Control Council.",,"Combustion; Fuel injection; Fuels; Modular construction; Stochastic systems; Combustion behaviours; Combustion controllers; Control strategies; Controlled parameter; Different operating conditions; Emissions regulations; Feed back information; Operating condition; Controllers",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111935823

Its epidemiology involves related factors such as human settlements, vector reproduction sites, mobility, productive activity, and the response capacity of health systems, among others. Objective: To describe malaria transmission by Plasmodium vivax in a non-endemic area of Ecuador by analyzing the epidemiological and entomological factors involved. Materials and methods: We conducted the epidemiological study of the cases reported in the Salinas canton and the characterization of vector breeding sites through captures of larvae and adult mosquitoes by human capture of resting mosquitoes. Results: We detected 21 cases of malaria with local transmission related to the presence of initial cases in Venezuelan migrant patients and identified Anopheles albimanus as the predominant vector in natural breeding sites such as estuaries, wells, and water channels. Conclusions: We detected an outbreak of malaria triggered by imported cases from Venezuela. Climatic, social, environmental, and ecological conditions have favored the development of the vector maintaining the transmission cycle. Strategies to control imported malaria should be multiple including early case detection and control of productive breeding sites to avoid local transmission. © 2021.

The formation of a solid solution in the bimetallic Pd-based compounds was confirmed by a contraction of the Pd unit cell volume, measurements of the TEM interplanar distance, and cyclic voltammetry characterization. Pd-based electrocatalysts presented smaller crystallite sizes (9 nm-18 nm) than Cu2O/C and SnOX/C (62 nm and 82 nm, respectively). Pd/C, Pd-Cu2O/C, and Pd-SnO2/C showed the highest electrochemical activity to perform the CO2RR due to a lower overpotential value compared to Cu2O/C and SnOX/C. The Tafel plots during CO2RR revealed a small slope in the region of lower overpotentials for the Pd-based electrocatalysts (less than 52 mV dec-1), which indicates a better kinetic compared to Cu2O/C and SnOX/C (165 and 193 mV dec-1, respectively). SnOX presented the highest selectivity toward HER instead of CO2 reduction. DEMS measurements allowed the determination of the selectivity for the electrocatalysts to produce specific CO2 reaction products. Pd-based materials are suitable to perform the CO2RR since bimetallic electrocatalyst (Pd-Cu2O/C and Pd-SnO2/C) generates CO, formic acid, and CH4 as reaction products. At the same time, Pd/C produced CO and H2. On the other hand, Cu2O presented lower electrochemical activity than Pd-based materials, with CO as the main reaction product. The low overpotential and the faradic vs. ionic current profiles showed that SnOX/C could be classified as a promising material for hydrogen production in the presence of CO2. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd.","CO2electroreduction; DEMS technique; Interfacial-redox process; Selectivity-conversion","Copper oxides; Cyclic voltammetry; Electrocatalysts; Electrolysis; Hydrogen production; Mass spectrometry; Palladium compounds; CO$-2$/ reduction; CO2electroreduction; Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry; Differential electrochemical mass spectrometry technique; Electrochemical activities; Interfacial-redox process; Overpotential; Pd-based; Pd-based electrocatalysts; Selectivity-conversion; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102515699

The roles of other climatic factors are, however, comparatively poorly understood, despite potentially also strongly structuring community patterns. Wind, for example, is seldom considered when forecasting species responses to climate change, despite having direct physiological and mechanical impacts on plants. It is, therefore, important to understand the magnitude of potential impacts of changing wind conditions on plant communities, particularly given that wind patterns are shifting globally. Here, we examine the relationship between wind stress (i.e. a combination of wind exposure and wind speed) and species richness, vegetation cover and community composition using fine-scale, field-collected data from 1,440 quadrats in a windy sub-Antarctic environment. Wind stress was consistently a strong predictor of all three community characteristics, even after accounting for other potentially ecophysiologically important variables, including pH, potential direct incident solar radiation, winter and summer soil temperature, soil moisture, soil depth and rock cover. Plant species richness peaked at intermediate wind stress, and vegetation cover was highest in plots with the greatest wind stress. Community composition was also related to wind stress, and, after the influence of soil moisture and pH, had a similar strength of effect as winter soil temperature. Synthesis. Wind conditions are, therefore, clearly related to plant community characteristics in this ecosystem that experiences chronic winds. Based on these findings, wind conditions require greater attention when examining environment–community relationships, and changing wind patterns should be explicitly considered in climate change impact predictions. © 2021 British Ecological Society","community composition; fine scale; plant community; species richness; vegetation cover; wind","climate conditions; community composition; community structure; ecophysiology; plant community; precipitation assessment; species richness; temperature effect; wind stress; Antarctica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101942678

In response, these ecosystems migrate landward, converting available upland into salt marsh. In the coastal-plain surrounding Chesapeake Bay, United States, conversion of coastal forest to salt marsh is well-documented and may offset salt marsh loss due to sea level rise, sediment deficits, and wave erosion. Land slope at the marsh-forest boundary is an important factor determining migration likelihood, however, the standard method of using field measurements to assess slope across the marsh-forest boundary is impractical on the scale of an estuary. Therefore, we developed a general slope quantification method that uses high resolution elevation data and a repurposed shoreline analysis tool to determine slope along the marsh-forest boundary for the entire Chesapeake Bay coastal-plain and find that less than 3% of transects have a slope value less than 1%; these low slope environments offer more favorable conditions for forest to marsh conversion. Then, we combine the bay-wide slope and elevation data with inundation modeling from Hurricane Isabel to determine likelihood of coastal forest conversion to salt marsh. This method can be applied to local and estuary-scale research to support management decisions regarding which upland forested areas are more critical to preserve as available space for marsh migration. © Copyright © 2021 Molino, Defne, Aretxabaleta, Ganju and Carr.","Chesapeake Bay; coastal forest; marsh migration; salt marsh; sea level rise",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107045867

Due to the intermittency of solar power, battery energy storage systems (BESSs) emerge as an important component of solar-integrated power systems due to its ability to store surplus solar power to be used at later times to avoid wastage and increase utilities profit. Conventionally, BESSs are by default placed on busses where solar farms are located, so that surplus solar power can be stored immediately without undergoing delivery over transmission lines and therefore avoid line losses. By extension, this placement method considers that each of the deployed BESS is dedicated to only the local solar farms. In other words, BESSs are deployed without considering network topology and cooperation among BESSs by pooling all their capacities to store surplus solar power is limited. Therefore, this paper proposes a method that optimally deployed BESSs and determined their capacity in a two-part framework to minimize solar energy curtailment, by considering network topology and power flow constraints. Results demonstrate that our proposed method is more efficient than the conventional deployment strategy in that it manages to store more surplus solar power. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Battery storage system; Optimum placement; Renewable; Solar integration","Electric batteries; Electric load flow; Electric power transmission; Electric power transmission networks; Solar energy; Solar power generation; Solar power plants; Topology; Battery energy storage systems; Carbon emissions; Deployment strategy; Integrated Power Systems; Network topology; Optimum allocation; Placement methods; Renewable energy source; Battery storage; energy efficiency; energy storage; integrated approach; optimization; photovoltaic system; power plant; solar power; topology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101104162

This was done by analysing various taxation scenarios to reduce environmental impacts of food, including taxation based on: climate impact; a score based on weighting of several environmental impacts; and adjusted rates of value-added tax (VAT). A net decrease in food consumption was seen for most taxation scenarios, resulting in reduced burdens for climate change and most other environmental categories. An exception was found for a scenario simulating reduced VAT rates for plant-based products, where a net increase of food consumption was seen, resulting in an increased burden for all environmental categories. Many of the scenarios resulted in a decrease in beef consumption, and hence a decline in pasture use. This is positive from a global perspective by limiting expansion of agricultural land, but on regional level in Sweden it could cause a goal conflict with maintaining biodiversity-rich semi-natural pastures. To avoid this, beef production on semi-natural pastures could be further incentivised by production-side measures. With regard to biodiversity loss, the overall burden could increase if taxation leads to an increase in products from biodiverse regions. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate tax; Environmental impacts; Food; Goal conflicts; Synergies; Value-added tax","environmental impact; food consumption; food market; food policy; tax system; Sweden",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107032321

Environmental and individual factors contributing to these deaths may be multifaceted, but they have not yet been explored in Tanzania.

A time series study design was employed using meteorological and health data of the Tanga Region collected from January 2016 to December 2018 from the Tanzania Meteorological Authority and Health Management Information System, respectively. The generalized negative binomial regression technique was used to explore the associations between climate indicators (i.e., precipitation, humidity, and temperature) and the occurrence of pneumonia. There were trend differences in climate indicators and the occurrence of pneumonia between the Tanga and Handeni districts. We found a positive association between humidity and increased rates of non-severe pneumonia (incidence rate ratio (IRR) = 1.01; 95% CI: 1.01–1.02; p ≤ 0.05) and severe pneumonia (IRR = 1.02; 95% CI: 1.01–1.03; p ≤ 0.05). There was also a significant association between cold temperatures and the rate of severe pneumonia in Tanga (IRR = 1.21; 95% CI: 1.11–1.33; p ≤ 0.001). Other factors that were associated with pneumonia included age and district of residence. We found a positive relationship between humidity, temperature, and incidence of pneumonia in the Tanga Region.

In this study, a total of 57 groundwater samples were collected from the Rupnagar district of this region (one sample per 36 km2) to evaluate its quality, the role of hydrogeochemical processes in its contamination, and further their potential human health hazards. The results indicate that the major water chemistry is governed by carbonate weathering followed by silicate weathering. The Fe, Mg, Mn, Se, and HCO3- concentrations exceeded the BIS drinking water standards in 86, 51, 11, 9, and 79% of the samples, respectively. Piper and Durov plots indicated the dominance of Ca-HCO3- water types, followed by Ca-Mg-Cl- and Ca-Cl-. Furthermore, multivariate analyses indicated the geogenic origin for Fe, Mg, Mn, Se, SO42-, and anthropogenic sources (agrochemicals, cement factories, and fly ash) for NO3-, Cu, and Cr. The estimated carcinogenic risk of As and Cr falls under the very low (10-6) to low (10-5) risks category. Furthermore, the cumulative risk of non-carcinogenic contaminants (F-, U, NO3-) (HI-0.93) is at an alarming level and also close to the boundary line of USEPA limits (HI-1). There is an urgent need to undertake suitable policy measures for sustainability of groundwater quality. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Groundwater; Health risks; Heavy metals; Hydrochemistry; Punjab","boundary line; concentration (composition); drinking water; groundwater; health risk; hydrochemistry; multivariate analysis; public health; risk assessment; silicate; sustainability; India",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105606728

Fifth Avenue, Portland, OR  97201, United States","Society and the environment in the arid southwestern United States depend on reliable water availability, yet current water use outpaces supply. Water demand is projected to grow in the future and climate change is expected to reduce supply. To adapt, water managers need robust estimates of future regional water supply to support management decisions. To address this need, we estimate future streamflow in seven water resource regions in the southwestern U.S. using a new SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) streamflow model. We present streamflow projections corresponding to input data from seven climate models and two greenhouse gas Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP4.5 and 8.5) for three, thirty-year intervals centered on the 2030s, 2050s, and 2080s, and for a historical thirty year interval centered on the 1990s. Across water resource regions, about half of the RCP4.5 models (51%) and two thirds of the RCP8.5 models (67%) indicate decreases in streamflow in the 2080s relative to the historical period. Models project maximum decreases in streamflow of 36–80% in all water resource regions for all periods and RCPs relative to historical streamflow, and maximum streamflow decreases of up to 20–45% in the 2080s at sites along the Colorado River used for measuring compliance with interstate and international water agreements. Headwaters are projected to experience the greatest declines, with substantial downstream implications. Among these estimates, the streamflows from models forced with RCP8.5 tend to be lower than those forced with RCP4.5. Not all climate models, times, and RCPs project widespread streamflow declines. The most ubiquitous streamflow increases are projected to occur in the 2030s under RCP4.5. Later time periods and enhanced greenhouse gas forcings indicate smaller regions of streamflow increase and lower accumulated streamflows, suggesting that limiting or reducing greenhouse gas concentrations could support future water availability. Although some possible streamflow increases are promising, the modest and spatially limited increases in streamflow projected for later time periods are still unlikely to be sufficient to meet the projected water demand. These results inform the likelihood of future water agreement compliance, and support developing strategies to balance water supply and demand. © 2021","Climate change impacts; Streamflow; Water supply and demand","Climate change; Climate models; Digital storage; Economics; Greenhouse gases; Stream flow; Water supply; Developing strategy; Gas concentration; Historical periods; International waters; Management decisions; Streamflow modeling; Water availability; Water supply and demands; Water resources; climate change; climate modeling; streamflow; water availability; water demand; water management; water resource; water supply; Colorado River [North America]; United States",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100578138

Their influence on both emissions (particulate matter and gaseous emissions) and deposits formation (fouling and slagging) are here considered. The uncertainty in the availability, under current sustainability criteria, of good-quality woody biomass (i.e. woody biomass with low content in ash-forming species, mainly derived from stem wood), along with the growing demand for biomass fuels, has caused the pellet industry to attempt to diversify the sources of raw material. Other types of biomass such as bark, non-woody biomass (cereals and herbaceous materials), and residues from the agricultural industry are also potentially useful as raw materials due to the large volumes available. These fuels present however some challenges. They vary strongly in composition, impacting significantly their combustion behaviour. The high content in ash-forming species, such as alkali and alkaline-earth species, chlorine, phosphorous, nitrogen, and silicon can lead to an increase in gaseous (e.g. sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides) and particulate matter (PM) emissions. They can also lead to operational problems, such as fouling, corrosion, slagging, and agglomeration during the combustion process. There are several routes to mitigate these ash-related problems, whose applicability depends on the technology and scale. In the present review, the use of additives to reduce emissions and deposits formation, as well as further operational problems these may trigger, is evaluated. However, the high heterogeneity in biomass composition and varying nature of the aforementioned combustion issues hinders the possibility to use a “one-size-fits-all” additive, resulting in the need for developing further understanding on the impact of different additives according to biomass composition and combustion conditions. For example, aluminosicates have proven to be effective to reduce fine particulate matter emissions, but they increase the gaseous emissions of HCl and SOx. The impact of Ca-based additives on PM and alkali-induced slagging is inconclusive, although they can capture gaseous emissions such as HCl and SOx. The additive application method and combustion conditions play on top a very significant role. For all this, reaching conclusions on the type of additive, amount, and application method is very challenging. With this work the authors aim at providing an overview of the state-of-art on the use of additives in biomass combustion, as well as to offer a framework to advance in the regulation on the use of additives. © 2020","Additives; Alminosilicates; Biomass; Combustion; Corrosion; PM; Slagging","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Biomass; Calcium compounds; Chlorine compounds; Combustion; Corrosion; Deposits; Nitrogen oxides; Particles (particulate matter); Particulate emissions; Wood fuels; Agricultural industries; Biomass compositions; Combustion behaviours; Combustion condition; Fine particulate matter; Operational problems; Particulate matter emissions; Sustainability criteria; Additives",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100894852

Microbial functional groups that sequester C from cellulose, and the accumulation of cellulose C in soil aggregates, remains debated. We hypothesized that cellulose derived 13C would be more efficiently converted into soil organic C by microorganisms, and retained in soil subjected to long-term application of compost. In this study, soil sampled from a long-term (27 years) field experiment with application of compost (Compost), NPK fertilizers (NPK) and without fertilizers (control), was incubated with 13C-cellulose for 120 days. The cellulose 13C content, microbial community structure (lipid biomarkers) and microbial 13C use efficiency (CUE) were measured. The incorporation of 13C into large macroaggregates (&gt;2000 μm), small macroaggregates (250–2000 μm), microaggregates (53–250 μm), and silt + clay fraction (&lt;53 μm) was analyzed to elucidate cellulose 13C sequestration process in aggregates. In contrast to our initial hypothesis, 13C remaining in soil after 120 days of incubation was maximal in unfertilized soil (25%) and minimal in Compost soil (17%). Compost soil had higher abundance of fungi and especially fast-growing bacteria (Gram-negative (G–) bacteria) than NPK and control soils. This accelerated decomposition and lowered CUE of 13C, therefore reducing the amount of 13C remaining in the Compost soil. In contrast, in the other soils, the lower fungal abundance reduced cellulose decomposition, which in turn contributed to growth of Gram-positive (G+) bacteria characterized by larger CUE than G– bacteria. This increased the ratio of G+/G– bacteria, resulting in larger CUE and more 13C remaining in NPK and control soils. Cellulose-derived 13C content decreased in small macroaggregates and microaggregates for all three soils, and in silt + clay fraction for the Compost soil; meanwhile, cellulose-derived 13C content increased in the silt + clay fraction for NPK and control soils from day 14 onwards. The ratios of 13C content in small macroaggregates and microaggregates to that in silt + clay fraction were higher in NPK and unfertilized soils than in Compost soil during the incubation. This indicated that less 13C was redistributed from large aggregates to silt + clay fraction in Compost soil. Overall, cellulose was more rapidly decomposed and incorporated into aggregates in organic C-rich soil, but their transformation efficiency into soil organic C was lower than in organic C-poor soil. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","13C distribution; 13C-cellulose; Microbial carbon use efficiency; Phospholipid fatty acids; Soil aggregates","Aggregates; Bacteria; Carbon; Composting; Efficiency; Fatty acids; Fertilizers; Fungi; Phospholipids; Silt; $+13$/C; 13C distribution; 13C-cellulose; C contents; Clay fractions; Microbial carbon use efficiency; Phospholipid fatty acids; Silt clay; Soil aggregate; Use efficiency; Cellulose; abundance; bacterium; cellulose; community structure; compost; microbial activity; microbial community; nutrient use efficiency; soil aggregate; soil carbon; soil microorganism; Bacteria; Carbon; Composting; Efficiency; Fatty Acids; Fertilizers; Negibacteria; Posibacteria; unclassified Gram-positive bacteria",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104968954

The purpose of this article is to present the main results of the study and analysis of atmospheric air pollution by the asphalt plant, which is located almost in the center of Yekaterinburg; to investigate the compliance of the existing hazard class of the enterprise, which increases its production volumes, to correct the size and location of the sanitary protection zone of the plant, taking into account the wind rose, and to try to propose a number of measures to reduce the negative impact of the plants in this industry. In considering the impact of anthropogenic activities on nature, attention should be paid to the concept of sustainable development, which carries principles based on the satisfaction of human needs, with a focus on caring for the well-being of future generations. If we consider the issue from the perspective of this concept, then the asphalt plant, in order to prevent possible environmental damage, should invest material and money to further minimize the amount of pollutants. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2021.",,"Agricultural robots; Asphalt; Asphalt plants; Atmospheric chemistry; Environmental protection; Fertilizers; Indicators (chemical); Industrial chemicals; Industrial emissions; Planning; Pollution; Urban growth; Anthropogenic activity; Chemical fertilizers; Environmental damage; Environmental pollutions; Industrial enterprise; Sanitary protection zone; Sustainable urban development; Technological process; Sustainable development",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107263760

Hence, investigation of the influence of land management and climate change on SOC is required to facilitate climate change mitigation practices. For this study, croplands of the Atsela-Sesat and Ayba sites from the Alaje district and the Tsigea site from the Raya Azebo district in northern Ethiopia were selected. The RothC model was used to predict future SOC trends and evaluate impacts of climate and land-management change scenarios on SOC stocks. The RothC model was run for two scenarios, (i) business as usual (scenario 1) and (ii) improved crop residue and manure management (scenario 2), to predict SOC stock changes in the cropland under current and future climate change. The current SOC content and SOC stock of the croplands are 14.4 g kg−1 and 26.7 t ha−1 in Atsela-Sesat, 14.8 g kg−1 and 27.9 t ha−1 in Ayba and 14.8 g kg−1 and 26.9 t ha−1 in Tsigea, respectively. The RothC model-predicted SOC accumulation for this century in scenario 1 was 0.26 t C ha−1 in Alaje and 0.18 t C ha−1 in Raya Azebo, whereas in scenario 2 it was 0.52 t C ha−1 in Alaje and 0.36 t C ha−1 in Raya Azebo. Although the predicted SOC accumulation in scenario 2 is higher than in scenario 1 and the baseline scenario, it still has a decreasing trend due to climate change. However, the organic carbon return into the soil is generally small and thus it will not be possible to improve soil productivity and attain food security. Therefore, future soil fertility strategies need to include both organic and inorganic fertilizer application. These findings will help to assist land managers to make informed decisions during land-management practices to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

The variety of emission sources and the nature of CO2 hinders estimating its concentration in real time and therefore to adopt flexible policies that contribute to its control and, ultimately, to reduce its effects. Spain is not exempted from this challenge and CO2 emissions are published only at the end of the year and as an aggregated value for the whole country, without recognising the existing differences between the regions (the so-called, Autonomous Communities). The recent COVID-19 pandemic is a clear example of the need of accurate and fast estimation methods so that policies can be tailored to the current status and not to a past one. This paper provides a method to estimate monthly emissions of CO2 for each AACC in Spain based on data that are published monthly by the relevant administrations. The paper discusses the approximations needed in the development of the method, predicts the drop in emissions due to the reduced industrial activity during the pandemic in Spain and provides the estimation of future emissions under three recovery scenarios after the pandemic. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2; COVID-19; Emissions; Forecast","Forecasting; Global warming; Industrial emissions; Accurate estimation; Aggregated values; CO$-2$/ emission; COVID-19; Emission; Emission sources; Emissions estimation; Estimation methods; Fast estimation; Real- time; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102108260

Prof. Luís Freire, 1000, Recife, PE, Brazil","The lack of robust scientific data still hinders estimates of soil and plant carbon (C) losses due to land-use changes in most dry tropical ecosystems. The present study investigated the effects of land-use and cover changes on total ecosystem C stocks in NE Brazil, aiming to quantify C losses after the removal of the native forest, known as Caatinga. The sampling design included the four main land-use/cover types (Dense Caatinga, Open Caatinga, Pastures and Crop fields) and the seven main soil classes (Arenosols, Acrisols, Regosols, Ferrasols, Luvisols, Planosols, and Leptosols), a combination that represents over 90% of the region. This design resulted in 192 sampling points (48 in each land-use), distributed proportionally to the area of occurrence of each soil class. In each sampling point, we determined C stocks in soil organic matter (SOM) and roots (to a depth of 1 m or rock layer), aboveground vegetation biomass (trees and herbs, separately), deadwood, and surface litter. Areas covered by Dense Caatinga store, on average, nearly 125 Mg ha−1 of C. Most of this C is stored in the soil organic matter (72.1%), followed by aboveground biomass (15.9%), belowground biomass (7.3%), deadwood (2.9%), litter (1.3%), and herbaceous biomass (0.5%). The substitution of Dense Caatinga to plant pastures and crop fields caused losses of &gt;50% of ecosystem C stocks, reaching almost 65 Mg ha−1 of C, with nearly equal losses from the SOM and vegetation biomass compartments. Open Caatinga store nearly 30% less C than Dense Caatinga. Contrary to what was expected, the overall differences in C stocks between soil classes were not significant, with a few exceptions. We expect that the findings of this study will contribute to a more robust inventory of GHG emissions/removals due to land-use changes in NE Brazil and other dry tropical regions of the globe. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Arid regions; Caatinga; Deforestation; Ecosystem C stocks; NE Brazil","Biogeochemistry; Biomass; Carbon; Crops; Ecosystems; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Organic compounds; Soils; Tropics; Vegetation; Above ground biomass; Belowground biomass; Herbaceous biomass; Land use and cover change; Seasonally dry tropical forests; Soil organic matters; Tropical ecosystems; Vegetation biomass; Land use; caatinga; dry forest; land use change; pasture; seasonality; soil carbon; soil emission; soil organic matter; tropical forest; vegetation structure; Brazil; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100630198

This paper argues, first and foremost, that this overlooks the contextual struggles associated with renewable energy projects. We do so through critical engagement with an ‘Energy Lifecycle Framework’ approach to understanding claims of energy (in)justice in Oaxaca, Mexico. This framework for energy justice scholarship promises to enable whole systems interpretations related to the potential synergies and manifestations of injustice, existing at stages from resource extraction to waste, as well as opportunities for achieving more holistic forms of justice. Offering the stages of manufacturing and construction as crucial phases of any systemic approach to RETs and discussing the stage of consultation (an obligatory step in Mexico for energy projects in indigenous territories), the paper challenges and questions our ability to generate abstract interpretations of the relationship between energy lifecycles and their associated, contextually grounded, injustices. To do so, we draw upon extensive ethnographic fieldwork around the development of utility-scale wind power (USWP) projects undertaken in Oaxaca, where a number of regional peasant and indigenous groups have led sustained resistance to USWP on the basis of environmental, political and socio-economic impacts. Demonstrating how pre-existent and embedded cultural and environmental relationships determine the way in which energy justice is understood and constructed, the paper demonstrates tension as it simultaneously corroborates the usefulness of the Energy Lifecycle Framework and urges caution towards universalistic and staged approaches to assessing injustices in energy systems. © 2021","Energy justice; Energy lifecycle framework; Mexico; Renewable energy technologies; Wind power",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102623464

It is responsible for over a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions. Passenger vehicles, alone, account for nearly 41% of these emissions, resulting in human health impacts. To meet the Paris climate commitments, cars and vans should be decarbonized until 2050. Such a transformation requires general changes, such as how the vehicles are owned, taxed, and driven. The European Federation for Transport and Environment revealed that Mediterranean countries tend to emit less per vehicle compared to the northern and central Europeans. Intriguingly, this does not necessarily correspond to motorization rates. In this article, we assess whether the observed reductions in CO2 emissions in the Mediterranean countries can be attributed to vehicle taxation on CO2 emissions. We apply panel data econometric techniques using data on annual registrations from 2008 to 2018 and model the demand for new-vehicle purchases and their responsiveness to changes in both CO2-based taxation and circulation tax. Our results show the determinants of new-vehicle demand and the change in the emissions rate in each country under the taxation currently adopted. We found that fiscal policies can have an important role in reducing the emission in the Mediterranean countries. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods and Materials: A series of in silico studies was conducted via treatment plan optimization in FRoG and the RayStation TPS to compare SHArc therapy against reference plans using conventional techniques with single, parallel-opposed, and 3-field configurations for 3 clinical particle beams (protons [p], helium [4He], and carbon [12C] ions). Tests were performed on water-equivalent cylindrical phantoms for simple targets and clinical-like scenarios with an organ-at-risk in proximity of the target. Effective dose and dose-averaged linear energy transfer (LETD) distributions for SHArc were evaluated against conventional planning techniques applying the modified microdosimetric kinetic model for considering bio-effect with (α/β)x = 2 Gy. A model for hypoxia-induced tumor radio-resistance was developed for particle therapy with dependence on oxygen concentration and particle species/energy (Zeff/β)2 to investigate the impact on effective dose. Results: SHArc plans exhibited similar target coverage with unique treatment attributes and distributions compared with conventional planning, with carbon ions demonstrating the greatest potential for tumor control and normal tissue sparing among the arc techniques. All SHArc plans exhibited a low-dose bath outside the target volume with a reduced maximum dose in normal tissues compared with single, parallel-opposed, and 3-field configuration plans. Moreover, favorable LETD distributions were made possible using the SHArc approach, with maximum LETD in the r = 5 mm tumor core (~8 keVμm-1, ~30 keVμm-1, and ~150 keVμm-1 for p, 4He, and 12C ions, respectively) and reductions of high-LET regions in normal tissues and organs-at-risk compared with static treatment beam delivery. Conclusion: SHArc therapy offers potential treatment benefits such as increased normal tissue sparing. Without explicit consideration of oxygen concentration during treatment planning and optimization, SHArc-C may mitigate tumor hypoxia-induced loss of efficacy. Findings justify further development of robust SHArc treatment planning toward potential clinical translation. © 2021 The Author(s)",,"carbon; helium; proton; Article; computer model; dose volume histogram; helium ion radiation; in vitro study; ion therapy; kinetics; linear energy transfer; oxygen concentration; particle therapy; planning target volume; priority journal; proton therapy; publication; radiation; radiosensitivity; relative biologic effectiveness; spot scanning hadron arc therapy; synchrotron radiation; treatment planning; tumor hypoxia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102801779

We consider optimal forward-looking technology investments, and study implications for the order of extraction of conventional and shale gas, and a backstop technology, and characterize the development of gas prices. We find that technology investments increase during the extraction of conventional gas. Once production shifts towards shale gas, investments decline. Consistent with current trends, our theory explains how gas prices can follow a U-shaped path. The calibrated model suggests that U.S. shale gas production continues to grow and prices continue to decrease until 2050. We analytically and numerically show that the introduction of a carbon tax would reduce technology investments, and thus could drastically change the temporal patterns of U.S. shale gas extraction. The forward-looking behaviour of firms is crucial for such an effect, which does not occur in models that treat the improvement in extraction technology as an unanticipated shock to the industry. © 2021 The Authors","Carbon tax; Endogenous technological change; Extraction costs; Natural gas prices; Optimal order of extraction; Optimal transition; Renewable backstop; Shale gas","Costs; Extraction; Gases; Investments; Shale gas; Backstop technology; Calibrated model; Endogenous technological change; Extraction technology; Natural resource use; Resource extraction; Technology investments; Temporal pattern; Gas industry; gas industry; gas production; investment; natural gas; natural resource; pollution tax; resource use; technological change; theoretical study; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104077651

This study aims at examining the association between COVID-19 cases, air pollution, climatic and socioeconomic factors using geospatial techniques in three provincial capital cities and the federal capital city of Pakistan. A series of relevant data was acquired from 3 out of 4 provinces of Pakistan (Punjab, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) including the daily numbers of COVID-19 cases, PM2.5 concentration (μgm−3), a climatic factors including temperature (°F), wind speed (m/s), humidity (%), dew point (%), and pressure (Hg) from June 1 2020, to July 31 2020. Further, the possible relationships between population density and COVID-19 cases was determined. The generalized linear model (GLM) was employed to quantify the effect of PM2.5, temperature, dew point, humidity, wind speed, and pressure range on the daily COVID-19 cases. The grey relational analysis (GRA) was also implemented to examine the changes in COVID-19 cases with PM2.5 concentrations for the provincial city Lahore. About 1,92, 819 COVID-19 cases were reported in Punjab, Sindh, KPK, and Islamabad during the study period. Results indicated a significant relationship between COVID-19 cases and PM2.5 and climatic factors at p &lt; 0.05 except for Lahore in case of humidity (r = 0.175). However, mixed correlations existed across Lahore, Karachi, Peshawar, and Islamabad. The R2 value indicates a moderate relationship between COVID-19 and population density. Findings of this study, although are preliminary, offers the first line of evidence for epidemiologists and may assist the local community to expedient for the growth of effective COVID-19 infection and health risk management guidelines.

Here, the role of the beach morphology on wave runup and storm impact was investigated at four coastal communities located on the northern Yucatan coast. Current wave conditions based on regional wind simulations, topo-bathymetric transects measured at each location, and a nonlinear wave transformation model were employed to reconstruct multi-year runup time series. Dune morphology features and extreme water levels (excluding storm surge contributions) were further employed to determine the storm impact at each site for different return periods. Despite the similar offshore conditions along the coast, extreme water levels (i.e., runup and setup) showed intersite differences that were mainly ascribed to subaerial and submerged morphological features. Numerical results showed that the average surf zone beach slope, sandbars, berm, and dune elevation played an important role in controlling extreme water levels and storm impact at the study sites under the present climate. Moreover, in order to assess the potential effect of climate change on coastal flooding, we analyzed wave runup and storm impact in the best-preserved site by considering wave conditions and sea level rise (SLR) projections under the RCP 8.5 scenario. Modelling results suggest no significant increase in the storm impact regime between the present and future conditions in the study area unless SLR is considered. It was found that to accurately estimate SLR contribution, it should be incorporated into mean sea level prior to performing numerical wave runup simulations, rather than simply adding it to the resulting wave-induced water levels. © 2021 by the authors.

Chronicling the increasing rates of brutal suppression of local environmental and labor activists in rural and urban sites of extraction, this volume also foregrounds related violence in areas we might not expect, such as infrastructural developments, protected areas for nature conservation, and even geoengineering in the name of carbon mitigation. Contributors argue that extractive violence is not an accident or side effect, but rather a core logic of the 21st Century planetary experience. Acknowledgement is made not only of the visible violence involved in the securitization of extractive enclaves, but also of the symbolic and structural violence that the governance, economics, and governmentality of extraction have produced. Extractive violence is shown not only to be a spectacular event, but an extended dynamic that can be silent, invisible, and gradual. The volume also recognizes that much of the new violence of extraction has become cloaked in the discourse of ""green development,"" ""green building,"" and efforts to mitigate the planetary environmental crisis through totalizing technologies. Ironically, green technologies and other contemporary efforts to tackle environmental ills often themselves depend on the continuance of social exploitation and the contaminating practices of non-renewable extraction. But as this volume shows, resistance is also as multi-scalar and heterogeneous as the violence it inspires.

However, we have an extremely limited understanding of the ecology of iron-based ecosystems, and thus the linkages between iron oxidation, carbon cycling, and nitrate reduction. Here we investigate iron microbial mats from hydrothermal vents at Lōʻihi Seamount, Hawaiʻi, using genome-resolved metagenomics and metatranscriptomics to reconstruct potential microbial roles and interactions. Our results show that the aerobic iron-oxidizing Zetaproteobacteria are the primary producers, concentrated at the oxic mat surface. Their fixed carbon supports heterotrophs deeper in the mat, notably the second most abundant organism, Candidatus Ferristratum sp. (uncultivated gen. nov.) from the uncharacterized DTB120 phylum. Candidatus Ferristratum sp., described using nine high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes with similar distributions of genes, expressed nitrate reduction genes narGH and the iron oxidation gene cyc2 in situ and in response to Fe(II) in a shipboard incubation, suggesting it is an anaerobic nitrate-reducing iron oxidizer. Candidatus Ferristratum sp. lacks a full denitrification pathway, relying on Zetaproteobacteria to remove intermediates like nitrite. Thus, at Lōʻihi, anaerobic iron oxidizers coexist with and are dependent on aerobic iron oxidizers. In total, our work shows how key community members work together to connect iron oxidation with carbon and nitrogen cycling, thus driving the biogeochemistry of exported fluids. © 2020, The Author(s).",,"anoxic conditions; biogeochemistry; carbon cycle; deep sea; denitrification; hydrothermal vent; marine environment; nutrient cycling; oxic conditions; primary production; carbon; iron; anaerobic growth; denitrification; ecosystem; Hawaii; hydrothermal vent; oxidation reduction reaction; Anaerobiosis; Carbon; Denitrification; Ecosystem; Hawaii; Hydrothermal Vents; Iron; Oxidation-Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097682090

Therefore, photocatalysis contributes to the satisfaction of the increasing needs for clean energy, environmental remediation and, most recently, sanification. Most of the efficient semiconductor nanoparticles (NP), developed as photocatalysts, work in the ultraviolet (UV) spectral region and they are not able to exploit either visible (Vis) or near infrared (NIR) radiation. This limitation makes them unable to fully exploit the broad band solar radiaton or to be applied in indoor conditions. Recently, different approaches have been developed to extend the spectral activity of semiconductor NP, like for example band-gap engineering, integration with upconversion NP and plasmonic enhancement involving also hot-electron injection. Nevertheless, the use of organic molecules and metal complexes, for enhancing the photoactivity in the Vis and NIR, was one of the first strategies proposed for sensitization and it is still one of the most efficient. In this minireview we highlight and critically discuss the most recent and relevant achievements in the field of photocatalysis obtained by exploiting dye sensitization either via dynamic or static quenching.

By exploring a host material with a greater Tm3+-Tm3+ interionic distance, it is possible to improve the population of the lower-energy 1G4, 3F2,3, and 3H4 emitting states. The longer Tm3+-Tm3+ interionic distance in cubic Ba1-xYxF2+x reduces cross-relaxation mechanisms between Tm3+ ions, which results in less probable population of the high-energy Tm3+ levels and weak UV luminescence. Using a thermal decomposition synthesis, nanoparticles are proven to crystallize in the cubic Ba1-xYxF2+x phase in a CaF2-related structure. Nanoparticles of best quality were obtained for the composition BaYF5 (when x = 0.5), with a cubic lattice parameter a = 5.9073(3) Å. The upconversion mechanisms of BaYF5: Yb3+, Tm3+ nanoparticles are investigated by varying the dopant concentration and characterized by luminescence spectra and decay time measurements. These results prove the absence of the population of the 1D2 level, thus favoring the lower-energy transitions. Quantum yield results also show improved efficiencies of the lower-energy emissions, compared to previously reported results on larger Tm3+ emitting nanoparticles. In summary, using BaYF5: Yb3+, Tm3+ represents a successful strategy to improve the emissions from the lower-energy states, which is advantageous for bioimaging applications that rely on these transitions. © 2021 American Chemical Society.","cross-relaxation; crystal structures; lanthanides; luminescence dynamics; upconverting nanoparticles","Barium compounds; Calcium fluoride; Decomposition; Fluorspar; Infrared devices; Luminescence; Nanoparticles; Synthesis (chemical); Yttrium compounds; Cross relaxation; Dopant concentrations; Interionic distance; Luminescence spectrum; Upconversion mechanisms; Upconverting nanoparticles; UV luminescence; Visible and near infrared; Fluorine compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85108372312

Selected concentrations reflect a cabin environment with one crew member (0.12% v/v) and four crew members (0.45% v/v). Stepwise, sustained changes in influent carbon dioxide concentration on day four of the eight-day experiments simulated a dynamic crew size, reflective of a planetary surface mission. Control experiments used constant influent concentrations across eight days. Significant changes in growth rate (0.12%-to-0.45%: 57% increase; 0.45%-to-0.12%: 59% reduction) suggest a positive correlation between metabolic activity of C. vulgaris and environmental carbon dioxide concentration. Statistical tests illustrate that algae are more sensitive to reductions in influent carbon dioxide. No specific correlation of the nitrogen assimilation rate to influent carbon dioxide, suggesting a nitrogen-limited or irradiance-limited system. Photosynthetic yield results (0.59–0.72) indicate that the culture was minimally stressed in all tested conditions. This paper compares these results to findings of published, steady-state experiments conducted under similar carbon dioxide environments. The findings presented here imply that a sufficient volume of C. vulgaris, with nutrient supplementation or biomass harvesting, could support the respiratory requirements of a long duration human mission with a dynamic cabin environment and these data can be used in future dynamic models. © 2021 The Committee on Space Research (COSPAR)","Bioregenerative life support system; Carbon dioxide fixation; Chlorella; Dynamic carbon dioxide environment; Nitrogen assimilation","carbon dioxide; dissolved organic matter; nitrogen; oxygen; algal growth; Article; biomass; carbon dioxide fixation; cell density; Chlorella vulgaris; concentration (parameter); controlled study; crew member; data analysis software; growth rate; human; microbial metabolism; microclimate; nitrogen fixation; nonhuman; optical density; oxygen evolution; priority journal; space flight",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103770641

F. fujikuroi-infected plants were grown under six phytotron conditions: low (18/22 °C night/day), medium (22/26 °C), and high (26/30 °C) temperature, at either ambient (450 ppm) or elevated (850 ppm) CO2 concentrations. Bakanae disease index (DI), seedling death incidence, fungal DNA quantity, and chlorophyll and carbohydrate contents varied significantly in infected plants as a consequence of changes in both CO2 and temperature. Plant height and dry weight were only influenced by single factors (temperature for height, and temperature or CO2 for dry weight), and not by the CO2 × temperature interaction. Medium and high temperatures (irrespective of the CO2 level) increased the DI significantly (range from 67.5% to 95.8%) compared to low temperatures (range from 45.8% to 47.5%). Under elevated CO2 levels, noticeable differences in the expression of four rice defence-related genes and fungal DNA quantity were observed between those plants grown at higher temperatures and those at lower temperatures. Overall, combined and single effects of elevated CO2 and high temperatures seem to be favourable for bakanae disease development in the Mediterranean basin. © 2021 British Society for Plant Pathology","bakanae development; climate change; Fusarium fujikuroi; phytotrons; real-time PCR","carbon dioxide; disease incidence; fungal disease; fungus; infectious disease; low temperature; seedling; symptom; Mediterranean Region; Gibberella fujikuroi",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100576934

Moreover, the collection of raw materials for its production can provide added benefits such as reduction of wildfire risk, additional income for farmers, and decreased disposal costs. Although there is substantial literature on design and modeling of supply chains, the authors were unable to find a single reference with the information needed for the selection and cost estimation of each type of equipment involved in the supply chain. Therefore, the goal of this research is to gather information necessary for the construction and utilization of models that might drive the identification of a feasible supply chain to produce renewable fuels at a commercial scale. The primary objectives are to 1) understand the supply chain of critical feedstocks for renewable fuels production; 2) identify the equipment commercially available for collection and adequation of feedstock; and 3) consolidate information regarding equipment cost, energy consumption, and efficiency, as well as feedstock storage and transportation systems. This paper provides a compilation for five feedstock types studied for sustainable aviation fuel production: 1) agricultural residues and grasses, 2) forest residues, 3) urban wood waste, 4) oilseeds, 5) fats, oils & greases.

Yet, it remains unclear how the eddy field has varied over the past few decades. Furthermore, climate model predictions generally do not resolve mesoscale eddies, which could limit their accuracy in simulating future climate change. Here we show a global statistically significant increase of ocean eddy activity using two independent observational datasets of surface mesoscale eddy variability (one estimates surface currents, and the other is derived from sea surface temperature). Maps of mesoscale variability trends show heterogeneous patterns, with eddy-rich regions showing a significant increase in mesoscale variability of 2–5% per decade, while the tropical oceans show a decrease in mesoscale variability. This readjustment of the surface mesoscale ocean circulation has important implications for the exchange of heat and carbon between the ocean and atmosphere. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.",,"accuracy assessment; air-water interaction; climate change; climate modeling; global change; global climate; mesoscale eddy; regional climate; satellite altimetry; sea surface temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105147996

One of the leading candidates for the source of AME is small spinning dust grains. Such grains should be very small (approx. ≤1 nm diameter) in order for the rotational emission to fall within the observed frequency range. In addition, these nanosized grains should possess a significant dipole moment to account for the observed emissivities. These constraints have been shown to be compatible with spinning bare nanosilicate clusters, assuming that ∼1% of the total Si mass budget is held in these ultrasmall grains. Silicate dust can be hydroxylated by processing in the interstellar medium and is generally known to provide seeds for molecular water ice nucleation in denser regions. Herein, we use quantum chemical calculations to investigate how the dipole moment of Mg-rich pyroxenic (MgSiO3) nanoclusters is affected by both accretion of molecular water and dissociative hydration. Our work thus provides an indication of how the formation of water ice mantles is likely to affect the capacity of nanosilicates to generate AME. © Copyright © 2021 Mariñoso Guiu, Ferrero, Macià Escatllar, Rimola and Bromley.","anomalous microwave emission; density functional theory; dust grains; grain processing; hydroxylation; interstellar medium; nanosilicates; water ices",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85117588485

Gloger’s rule predicts that endothermic animals should have darker colors in warm/rainy climates. This rule also predicts that animals should be more rufous in warm/dry climates, the so-called complex Gloger’s rule. Empirical studies frequently demonstrate that animals are darker in cool/ wet climates rather than in warm/wet climates. Furthermore, sensory ecology predicts that, to enhance crypsis, animals should be darker in darker light environments. We aimed to disentangle the effects of climate and light environments on plumage color in the large Neotropical passerine family Furnariidae. We found that birds in cooler and rainier climates had darker plumage even after controlling for habitat type. Birds in darker habitats had darker plumage even after controlling for climate. The effects of temperature and precipitation interact so that the negative effect of precipitation on brightness is strongest in cool temperatures. Finally, birds tended to be more rufous in warm/dry habitats but also, surprisingly, in cool/wet locales. We suggest that Gloger’s rule results from complementary selective pressures arising from myriad ecological factors, including crypsis, thermoregulation, parasite deterrence, and resistance to feather abrasion. © 2021 by The University of Chicago.","Coloration; Furnariidae; Gloger’s rule; Light environments; Melanin; Thermal melanism","adaptation; color morph; condition factor; environmental factor; evolutionary biology; habitat type; light effect; passerine; tropical environment; Crypsis; Furnariidae; Passeriformes; animal; color; ecosystem; evolution; light; Passeriformes; physiology; pigmentation; temperature; tropic climate; Animals; Biological Evolution; Color; Ecosystem; Light; Passeriformes; Pigmentation; Temperature; Tropical Climate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103209704

These rangelands offer various resources to the communities and are in-turn vulnerable to climate change related challenges. Currently, information on greenhouse gases (GHG) emission from SSA rangelands is heavily dependent on the generic values generated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Tier I trajectories on various aspects of the environment. There is, therefore, a need to identify research gaps between the dynamics and influences of environmental components, highlight their magnitude and potential aggregate contribution towards GHG emission in an SSA context. Rangeland sustainability, weather patterns, soils, plant biodiversity, and current methods used to measure GHG emission from rangelands are influenced by institutional, community, and national policy frameworks. Various intertwined environmental components exist within the SSA rangeland ecosystems and research has not extensively covered such interactions.

A modal-activity-based method was implemented to reconstruct the second-by-second trajectories from the dataset as the input of the VT-Micro model. We updated the data of the Guangdong power generation mix to improve the estimation of BEBs’ CO2 emissions. The experiments showed that BEBs could reduce CO2 emissions by 18.0–23.9% in comparison with CDBs when the frequency of air-conditioning usage was low. In addition, BEBs tended to achieve more CO2 emission reduction benefits when the transit buses traveled at a low speed. Improving the traffic efficiency of road networks and promoting inter-provincial electricity trading are important to promote the adoption of BEBs. © 2021 by the authors.

Indonesia is one of the countries with the most extensive tropical forest systems in the world. However, Indonesia experienced the highest level of forest destruction in Southeast Asia. For this reason, Indonesia needs to apply the principles of Sustainable Forest Management to improve the condition of forests through reducing deforestation without compromising the improvement of the welfare of the surrounding community, both men and women. Previous studies prove the involvement of local communities, both men and women, who consider their local knowledge and wisdom is a determining factor for realizing the objectives of Sustainable Forest Management. Previous studies regarding improving the welfare of forest farmers have ignored the needs of both men and women. Similar studies have not been done much in Indonesia or at the global level. There is less research on local knowledge/knowledge that examines how gender differences determine differences in local knowledge/wisdom that men and women have and their respective needs regarding forest resources. For this reason, this study generally aims to increase knowledge about the differences in local wisdom/knowledge possessed and the perceived needs of both men and women who have the potential to rehabilitate forests while improving their lives. This research is the third study in Barangkalang Sangihe Village, located around the protected forest of Mount Sahendaruman. This study uses qualitative data collection methods concerning local wisdom and the needs of men and women relating to forest resources and management. The principle of triangulation is applied to data collection methods and sources. Data collection is done by interview, discussion and observation. Data sources are farmers and village leaders and social organizations. Data analysis uses a qualitative data analysis approach. The results showed that the subconscious of women in particular and the whole community in general who have absorbed the pattern of forest growth that is diverse, structured from high to lowest creeping, is the superiority of the community around the forest. The superiority of this subconscious can be used as a basic capital to develop forest agriculture (agroforestry) that supports each other (mutualistic symbiosis) with protected forests above. Protection Forest can be maintained well only by the community around the forest who can feel the positive impact of the existence of the protected forest, for example as a source of water and as a source of plant seeds (plasma nuftah). Commercial tree crops managed by farmers in the area around the forest cannot be ignored for their biological function for environmental preservation. Because commercial crops, among others, cloves, nutmeg, coconut, and sago, also perennial plants that have deep roots and are also managed like the growth of forestry plants are not regulated like modern plantations. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.",,"Agricultural robots; Climate change; Composting; Crops; Data acquisition; Data handling; Deforestation; Environmental protection; Information analysis; Planning; Rural areas; Seed; Sustainable development; Timber; Biological functions; Data collection method; Environmental preservation; Mutualistic symbiosis; Qualitative data analysis; Social organizations; Sustainable forest management; Sustainable forestry; Information management",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107844216

Concentrations of dissolved H2O and CO2 in experimental glasses were determined by ion microprobe calibrated on a subset of run glasses analyzed by high-temperature vacuum manometry. Assuming that the solubility of H2O in mafic melt is relatively well known, estimates ofXH2Ofluid and PH2Ofluid in the saturating fluid were modeled, and by difference, values for XCO2fluid and PCO2fluid were obtained (XCO2 ~0.5-0.9); fCO2 could be then calculated from the fluid composition, temperature, and pressure. Dissolved H2O over a range of 2.3-5.5 wt% had no unequivocal influence on the dissolution of CO2 at the pressures and fluid compositions examined. For these H2O concentrations, dissolved CO2 increases with fCO2 following an empirical power-law relation: dissolved CO2 (ppmw) = 14.9-3.5+4.5fCO2 (MPa)]0.7±0.03. The highest-pressure results plot farthest from this equation but are within its 1 standard-error uncertainty envelope. We compare our experimental data with three recent CO2-H2O solubility models: Papale et al. (2006); Iacono-Marziano et al. (2012); and Ghiorso and Gualda (2015). The Papale et al. (2006) and Iacono-Marizano et al. (2012) models give similar results, both over-predicting the solubility of CO2 in a melt of the Pavlof basaltic andesite composition across the fCO2 range, whereas the Ghiorso and Gualda (2015) model under-predicts CO2 solubility. All three solubility models would indicate a strong enhancement of CO2 solubility with increasing dissolved H2O not apparent in our results. We also examine our results in the context of previous high-pressure CO2 solubility experiments on basaltic melts. Dissolved CO2 correlates positively with mole fraction (Na+K+Ca)/Al across a compositional spectrum of trachybasalt-alkali basalt-tholeiite-icelandite-basaltic andesite. Shortcomings of current solubility models for a widespread arc magma type indicate that our understanding of degassing in the deep crust and uppermost mantle remains semi-quantitative. Experimental studies systematically varying concentrations of melt components (Mg, Ca, Na, K, Al, Si) may be necessary to identify solubility reactions, quantify their equilibrium constants, and thereby build an accurate and generally applicable solubility model. © 2021 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2021.","Experimental petrology; magmatic CO2; volatile solubility; volcanic degassing","Basalt; Carbon dioxide; Degassing; Dissolution; Equilibrium constants; Glass; Solubility; Volcanoes; Compositional spectra; Controlled experiment; Fluid composition; Power law relation; Saturating fluids; Solubility models; Solubility reactions; Strong enhancement; Sodium compounds; andesite; basalt; carbon dioxide; degassing; magma; petrology; solubility; volcano; Alaska; Alaska Peninsula; Mount Pavlof; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106315194

Organic molecular markers are a set of particularly useful marker compounds for estimating source contributions to the fine PM fraction (i.e., PM2.5 ). Although there are many source apportionment studies based on organic markers, these studies heavily rely on the few studies that report region-specific emission profiles. Source attribution efforts, particularly those conducted in countries with emerging economies, benefit from ad hoc information to conduct the corresponding analyses. In this study, we report organic molecular marker source profiles for PM2.5 emitted from 12 major sources types from five general source categories (meat cooking operations, vehicle exhausts, industries, biomass and trash burning, and urban background) for the Monterrey Metropolitan Area (Mexico). Source emission samples were obtained from a ground-based source-dominated sampling approach. Filter-based instruments were utilized, and the loaded filters were chemically characterized for organic markers by GC-MS. Levoglucosan and cholesterol dominate charbroiled-cooking operation sources while methoxyphenols, PAHs and hopanes dominate open-waste burning, vehicle exhaust and industrial emissions, respectively. A statistical analysis showed values of the Pearson distance &lt; 0.4 and the similarity identity distance &gt; 0.8 in all cases, indicating dissimilar source profiles. This was supported by the coefficient of divergence average values that ranged from 0.62 to 0.72. These profiles could further be utilized in receptor models to conduct source apportionment in regions with similar characteristics and can also be used to develop air pollution abatement strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

Carbonyl sulfide (COS), which is taken up by leaves through their stomates and then hydrolysed by photosynthetic enzymes, is a candidate GPP proxy. A former study with the ORCHIDEE land surface model used a fixed ratio of COS uptake to CO2 uptake normalised to respective ambient concentrations for each vegetation type (leaf relative uptake, LRU) to compute vegetation COS fluxes from GPP. The LRU approach is known to have limited accuracy since the LRU ratio changes with variables such as photosynthetically active radiation (PAR): while CO2 uptake slows under low light, COS uptake is not light limited. However, the LRU approach has been popular for COS GPP proxy studies because of its ease of application and apparent low contribution to uncertainty for regional-scale applications. In this study we refined the COS GPP relationship and implemented in ORCHIDEE a mechanistic model that describes COS uptake by continental vegetation. We compared the simulated COS fluxes against measured hourly COS fluxes at two sites and studied the model behaviour and links with environmental drivers. We performed simulations at a global scale, and we estimated the global COS uptake by vegetation to be 756 Gg S yr1, in the middle range of former studies (490 to 1335 Gg S yr1). Based on monthly mean fluxes simulated by the mechanistic approach in ORCHIDEE, we derived new LRU values for the different vegetation types, ranging between 0.92 and 1.72, close to recently published averages for observed values of 1.21 for C4 and 1.68 for C3 plants. We transported the COS using the monthly vegetation COS fluxes derived from both the mechanistic and the LRU approaches, and we evaluated the simulated COS concentrations at NOAA sites. Although the mechanistic approach was more appropriate when comparing to high-Temporal-resolution COS flux measurements, both approaches gave similar results when transporting with monthly COS fluxes and evaluating COS concentrations at stations. In our study, uncertainties between these two approaches are of secondary importance compared to the uncertainties in the COS global budget, which are currently a limiting factor to the potential of COS concentrations to constrain GPP simulated by land surface models on the global scale. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Many models have appeared in the literature to estimate near-field ground level concentrations from mobile sources moving on a highway. However, current models do not account explicitly for the effect of wind shear (magnitude) near the ground while computing the ground level concentrations near highways from mobile sources. This study presents an analytical model (SLINE 1.0) based on the solution of the convective–diffusion equation by incorporating the wind shear near the ground for gaseous pollutants. The dispersion coefficients for stable and unstable atmospheric conditions are based on the near-field parameterization. Initial vertical dispersion coefficient due to the wake effect of mobile sources is incorporated based on a literature review. The model inputs include emission factor, wind speed, wind direction, turbulence parameters, and terrain features. The model is evaluated based on the Idaho Falls field study (2008). The performance of the model is evaluated using several statistical parameters. Results indicate that the model performs well against this dataset in predicting concentrations under both the stable and unstable atmospheric conditions. The sensitivity of the model to compute ground-level concentrations for different inputs is presented for three different downwind distances. In general, the model shows Type III sensitivity (i.e., the errors in the input will show a corresponding change in the computed ground level concentrations) for most of the input variables using the ASTM (American Society for Testing and Materials) method. However, some recalibration of the model constants is needed using several field datasets to make sure that the model is acceptable for computing ground-level concentrations in engineering applications. © 2021 by the authors.

The present study explored the potential of energy recovery from biorefinery landfills by means of in-situ thermal processing of municipal solid waste (MSW) with a techno-economic analysis and using RETScreen clean energy project analysis software. An environmental assessment was performed to validate the sustainability of the proposed process. The biorefinery landfill uses existing MSW landfill infrastructure to move from a disposal-only paradigm to a product-creation paradigm. This innovative concept can reduce the extra costs of ex-situ conventional power plants by avoiding waste transportation to a secondary site. A case study in Atlantic Canada was employed to optimize energy reclamation from MSW via two principal pathways: (1) Rankine cycle steam power plant and (2) gas turbine. A plant with a 30 t h−1 capacity and 2 MW power production was proposed as a base case. The results indicated that the gross reduction in annual greenhouse gas emissions was 1115 t CO2 greater for a gas turbine than a steam cycle. Further, for a steam power plant, the capital cost was approximately three-fold higher, and the operating and maintenance costs were nearly eight-fold higher than a gas turbine plant. Study results will encourage progress towards a sustainable biopower system and lay the foundation for comprehensive analysis of renewable resources like MSW. The key outcomes of this study target growth of the circular bioeconomy. Moreover, they can serve as the basis to draw recommendations on the techno-economic feasibility of implementing such biorefineries, specifically at high latitudes where energy costs are relatively high. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental analysis; Gas turbine; In-situ gasification; Process intensification; Rankine steam cycle; RETScreen","Bioconversion; Costs; Economic analysis; Gas emissions; Gas plants; Gas turbines; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Rankine cycle; Refining; Steam; Steam engineering; Steam power plants; Steam turbines; Sustainable development; Biorefineries; Environmental analysis; In-buildings; In-situ gasification; Low grade materials; Process intensification; Rankine steam cycle; RETScreen; Steam power; Techno-Economic analysis; Municipal solid waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102279913

Species distribution modeling (SDM) based on maximum entropy algorithm (MaxEnt) showed that C. furcoides has a much wider potential range than its current distribution and isothermality as the key environmental variable determining its spatial pattern. The model successfully predicts areas of introduction and the climate matching approach has identified mainly tropical and some subtropical regions as most vulnerable areas at risk of introduction and establishment of C. furcoides. Furthermore, the observed shift of the climatic niche occurred between native and non-native ranges, providing, for the first time, a robust evidence that a dinoflagellate can occupy climatically distinct niche spaces following its introduction into new areas. This is probably mirroring the lack of adequate management to deal with various impacts on drainage basins, such as ongoing accelerated cultural eutrophication coupled with river impoundments and water diversion. Thus, this framework provides helpful insights on how to optimize our ability to anticipate invasions and to avoid ecosystem services losses, as well as future studies prospects on adaptive mechanisms of this pervasive invader. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.","Aquatic invasion; Dinoflagellate; Invasiveness; Niche shift; Risk assessment","dinoflagellate; drainage basin; ecosystem service; environmental factor; eutrophication; freshwater environment; niche; spatial analysis; subtropical region; Europe; Ceratium furcoides; Dinophyceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101845175

Whilst there is a growing field of scholarship in a European and North America setting, research on the policy and governance of urban greenspace for climate adaptation in subtropical Asia is limited. Given the different development patterns, environmental characteristics and governance arrangements in subtropical cities, plus their comparatively large population and high climate risk, this is a significant knowledge gap. In response, this paper evaluates competences – skill sets, capabilities, and supporting policy and legislation – to enact adaptation through greenspace across different governance contexts; and assesses how international rhetoric on nature-based adaptation becomes localised to subtropical Asian city settings. We conduct interviews with stakeholders, plus review of relevant policy and city-specific research, for three cities with different governance and development contexts: Hanoi (Vietnam); Taipei (Taiwan); and Fukuoka (Japan). Across all three cases, we find that institutional structures and processes for connecting different remits and knowledge systems are a bigger challenge than a lack of appropriate policy or individuals with the required technical knowledge. However, opportunities for civil society participation and consideration of justice issues vary between the cities according to the socio-political context. These findings illustrate the value of individuals and organisations able to work across institutional boundaries in linking greenspace and adaptation agendas for subtropical Asian cities; and the importance of competence in collaboration with developers and civil society so that the rapid development or regeneration seen in subtropical Asian contexts does not tend towards green climate gentrification. More broadly, our findings show that the diverse nature of subtropical Asian cities means the role of greenspace in climate adaptation is likely to be context-specific, and thus that caution must be exercised against uncritically importing best practices from exemplar cases elsewhere. © 2021 The Authors","Climate change adaptation; Environmental policy; Greenspace; Nature-based solutions; Urban planning","adaptation; civil society; climate change; comparative study; greenspace; subtropical region; Fukuoka [Kyushu]; Hanoi; Japan; Kyushu; Taipei; Taiwan; Viet Nam",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102650541

In this study, a partially unzipped carbon nanotube/reduction graphene oxide (PUCNT/RGO) hybrid fiber with less “dead volume” and a well-ordered porous structure is fabricated via wet spinning of a mixed partially unzipped oxidized carbon nanotube (PUOCNT)/GO solution and chemical reduction. The spinning solution is of low viscosity and high concentration, which can ensure smooth spinning while reducing the mass transfer during phase separation, thus lessen the “dead volume” derived from isolated pores. Moreover, PUOCNT with 1D and 2D hybrid nanoarchitecture, large specific surface area, and good water solubility can be a more effective spacer to inhibit the restacking of graphene oxide sheets while reducing the spacer itself and the large spacious voids formed “dead volume”.

The quarantine measures have significantly decreased the anthropogenic activities, thus improving air quality. To study the impacts caused by the lockdown on specific source sectors and regions in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model was used to investigate the changes in source contributions to fine particulate matter (PM 2.5) from 23 January to 28 February 2020, based on different emission control cases. Compared to case 1 (without emission reductions), the total PM 2.5 mass for case 2 (with emission reductions) decreased by more than 20 % over the entire YRD, and the reduction ratios of its components were 15 %, 16 %, 20 %, 43 %, 34 %, and 35 % in primary organic aerosol (POA), elemental carbon (EC), sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and secondary organic aerosol (SOA), respectively. The source apportionment results showed that PM 2.5 concentrations from transportation decreased by 40 %, while PM 2.5 concentrations from the residential and power sectors decreased by less than 10 % due to the lockdown. Although all sources decreased, the relative contribution changed differently. Contributions from the residential sector increased by more than 10 % to 35 %, while those in the industrial sector decreased by 33 %. Considering regional transport, the total PM 2.5 mass of all regions decreased 20 %-30 % in the YRD, with the largest decreased value of 5.0 μg m-3 in Henan, Hebei, Beijing, and Tianjin (Ha-BTH). In Shanghai, the lower contributions from local emissions and regional transmission (mainly Shandong and Ha-BTH) led to the reduced PM 2.5. This study suggests adjustments of control measures for various sources and regions. © Author(s) 2021.

Most past studies have simultaneously optimized one or two variables, resulting in a local optimal solution. To limit sulfur emissions, some governments have established Emission Control Areas (ECAs) in recent years, where ships must use low sulphur fuels. The constraints created by ECAs makes the simultaneous optimization of the three variables even more challenging. This study developed a nonlinear mixed integer programming model to address the challenge of simultaneously optimizing the three variables. After transforming the nonlinear discrete mixed integer programming model into a convex nonlinear continuous programming model, the study proposed a solution algorithm for the proposed model. The new model in this study was applied to the Europe-United States (US) and Southeast Asia service route. The results show that the optimal refueling policy, route, and speed selection can be determined simultaneously using the proposed model and solution method. The study investigated the impact of fuel price on ship refueling strategy, route, and speed; and developed insights from the example analyses. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Emission control areas; Nonlinear mixed integer programming; Refueling strategy; Route and speed planning; Simultaneously optimizing method","Emission control; Operating costs; Ships; Sulfur; Local optimal solution; Mixed integer programming model; Non-linear mixed integer programming; Programming models; Refueling strategy; Simultaneous optimization; Solution algorithms; Sulfur emissions; Integer programming",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101794385

The rhizosphere microbial community is the most abundant and diverse subset of the phytomi-crobiome and can include both beneficial and parasitic/pathogenic microbes. Prokaryotes of the phytomicrobiome have evolved relationships with plants that range from non-dependent interactions to dependent endosymbionts. The most extreme endosymbiotic examples are the chloroplasts and mitochondria, which have become organelles and integral parts of the plant, leading to some similar-ity in DNA sequence between plant tissues and cyanobacteria, the prokaryotic symbiont of ancestral plants. Microbes were associated with the precursors of land plants, green algae, and helped algae transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments. In the terrestrial setting the phytomicrobiome contributes to plant growth and development by (1) establishing symbiotic relationships between plant growth-promoting microbes, including rhizobacteria and mycorrhizal fungi, (2) conferring biotic stress resistance by producing antibiotic compounds, and (3) secreting microbe-to-plant signal compounds, such as phytohormones or their analogues, that regulate aspects of plant physiology, including stress resistance. As plants have evolved, they recruited microbes to assist in the adaptation to available growing environments. Microbes serve themselves by promoting plant growth, which in turn provides microbes with nutrition (root exudates, a source of reduced carbon) and a desirable habitat (the rhizosphere or within plant tissues). The outcome of this coevolution is the diverse and metabolically rich microbial community that now exists in the rhizosphere of terrestrial plants. The holobiont, the unit made up of the phytomicrobiome and the plant host, results from this wide range of coevolved relationships. We are just beginning to appreciate the many ways in which this complex and subtle coevolution acts in agricultural systems. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: We analyzed data from the Porter Novelli Public Services YouthStyles survey, a nationally representative survey of U.S. adolescents aged 12–17 years. In survey years 2015–2018, a total of 3,547 adolescents self-reported awareness, perceptions, and behaviors related to air pollution. We calculated weighted percentages of respondents reporting each aspect of air quality awareness, perception, and behaviors overall and by categories of age, gender, parental education, metropolitan status, region, and survey year. Results: Overall, an estimated 81% of U.S. adolescents thought outdoor air pollution could impact health, 52% thought there were things they could do to limit their or their family's exposure, 19% were aware of air quality alerts, 46% of those who thought or were informed air quality was bad did something differently, and 19% always or usually avoided busy roads to reduce air pollution exposure; differences were reported by some demographic variables. Conclusions: Among U.S. adolescents, awareness that air pollution could impact health was relatively high. However, gaps were found in the awareness of the potential impacts and other aspects of awareness and perceptions related to air pollution and the engagement in behaviors to reduce exposure, some of which varied by demographic characteristics. These results can be used to inform interventions that increase awareness and behaviors to reduce air pollution exposures among U.S. adolescents. © 2020","Adolescents; Air pollution; Air quality alerts; Avoidance behaviors; Behavior change; Environmental exposure; Environmental health; Health education; Physical activity; Teenagers","adolescent; air pollution; air quality; article; avoidance behavior; awareness; behavior change; child; demography; environmental exposure; environmental health; female; gender; health education; human; human experiment; major clinical study; male; perception; physical activity; school child; attitude to health; environmental exposure; perception; questionnaire; self report; Adolescent; Air Pollution; Child; Environmental Exposure; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Humans; Perception; Self Report; Surveys and Questionnaires",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090486870

Firstly, we quantify the contributions of potentially influential factors of CO2 emission, and then a further analysis of different relationships between CO2 emission and the mainly potential factors are identified. The results show that the motor vehicle amount, the disposable personal income, the carbon intensity, and the urbanization rate are the top four driving forces of CO2 emission. The result of Granger causality test indicates that the motor vehicle amount has a bidirectional Granger causality relationship with CO2 emission in different lags, while the urbanization rate, per motor vehicle secondary industry, per secondary industry population, per residents’ income GDP support coefficient and the carbon intensity have a one-way Granger causality relationship with CO2 emission. Interestingly, it is found that the policy implementation or main events are closely related to the influential factors of CO2 emission. Thus, policy makers should not only continue to implement current related policies of reducing CO2 emission but also pay attention to the effect of great events of urban development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emission; Granger causality test; LMDI; Shanghai","Carbon; Statistical tests; Urban growth; Vehicles; CO$-2$/ emission; Divisia index method; Driving forces; Granger Causality; Granger causality test; Influential factors; Logarithmic mean; Logarithmic mean divisia index method; Motor vehicle; Shanghai; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103371400

Furthermore, energy crops are vital to significantly impact the State’s large and burgeoning need for sustainable fuels. Among crops amenable to be grown in California to support fuel production, agave pose a particularly promising prospect, given their drought tolerance and high productivity on marginal land in a State prone to drought and limited water resources. This study focuses on measuring compositional profiles of wild A. deserti and cultivated A. americana, two agaves native to California, to elucidate their potential for biological conversion to fuels that can help meet the huge State need for low-carbon transportation. Results from this study indicate that these two California agave species can be rich in fructans, ranging from 96–314 g/L of equivalent fructose and glucose in their leaf bases. In addition, structural and water-soluble sugar contents exceeding 63 wt.% show that these plants are amenable to fermentation to ethanol and other biofuels. Moreover, because the low K-lignin content of agave leaf bases bagasse of only about 12–18 wt.% suggests low recalcitrance and the negligible acid insoluble ash content should facilitate pretreatment prior to fermentations, the agave species native to the State hold considerable promise as potential biofuel feedstocks. © 2021 Lu, Wyman.

Taking 266 cities as the research objects, the energy efficiency of each city is measured by Super-SBM model. Then the energy efficiency is decomposed by Malmquist index. The results show that: In 2006, the number of cities in high-efficiency areas is small and high efficiency areas are mostly distributed in the northeast and southeast coastal areas. There was a phenomenon of low efficiency areas agglomeration. But in 2017, the number of high-efficiency cities increased significantly. The number of high-efficiency cities in Northeast China increased, the number of high-efficiency cities in Southeast coastal areas decreased, and the number of high-efficiency cities in Central China increased and showed a phenomenon of agglomeration of high-efficiency areas or relatively high efficiency areas.

City-scale climate projections are essential for making informed decisions towards climate change mitigation and adaptation at city levels. This study aims at developing ensemble projections of temperature extremes at the city-level and quantifying the contributions of various factors to the resulting uncertainty of the ensemble projections. The city of Toronto will be used here as an example to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed research framework. In particular, the stepwise cluster analysis (SCA) model will be used to perform climate downscaling to three GCM datasets (GFDL, IPSL, and MPI) under three emission scenarios (RCP2.6, RCP4.5, and RCP8.5) in order to generate city-level climate projections for the city of Toronto. The SCA model is demonstrated to be capable of capturing the inter- and intra-annual variations of the daily maximum, mean, and minimum temperatures in the studied city. The results suggest that mean temperatures in Toronto are projected to increase at the rate of 0.15 and 0.5 °C/decade under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5, respectively, while no significant warming trend is detected for RCP2.6. In terms of temperature extremes, extreme warm events are projected to increase while extreme cold events decrease under all emission scenarios. The decrease in the heating demand is two to four times larger than the increase in the cooling demand, indicating a decrease in the city’s total energy use. The projected warming might be beneficial for the urban growers because of the significant increases in the growing season length and growing degree days; however, the residents of the city of Toronto are likely to experience simultaneous increases in the intensity, duration, and frequency of heatwave events in future summers. Because of the warming, coldwave events in winters are likely to become less frequent and be shorter in duration, but their intensity is expected to increase significantly. Through decomposition of the resulting uncertainty of the ensemble projections, emission scenario is found to be the dominant factor for the uncertainty associated with urban climate projection. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Climate change; Ensemble projection; Stepwise cluster analysis; Temperature; Toronto","air temperature; climate change; climate prediction; cluster analysis; downscaling; ensemble forecasting; extreme event; uncertainty analysis; urban climate; Canada; Ontario [Canada]; Toronto",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101558101

Parmar University of Horticulture and Forestry, Nauni, Solan, HP, India","Climate change entails considerable risks to water availability in the land-based ecosystem. Rising temperature, changes in precipitation patterns, and increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations affect the plant water use through increased evapotranspiration and other losses. Water availability is of paramount importance in ascertaining the plant distribution in the terrestrial ecosystem, as it plays a vital role in plant growth and productivity. The effects of reduced water availability vary by region and species type. Climate models suggest that changes in precipitation patterns are less likely to remain uniform than temperature and are more likely to vary between regions, with predictions for some regions to observe an increase in water availability and the rest to have a drought-like situation. These unprecedented changes in precipitation patterns may cause severe ramifications for plants in the terrestrial ecosystem. Species-specific response to changing water availability depends mainly on the stomatal response. Water use efficiency (WUE), carbon accumulation per unit of water transpired, is an important physiological parameter reflecting the plant response to altered water availability. To realize how efficiently the water is used by plants in response to climate change, WUE is measured at the leaf and the canopy level. Physiological factors like stomatal conductance and vapour pressure deficit are affecting the WUE at the leaf level, whereas the soil moisture availability (either through rainfall or irrigation) is affecting the WUE at the canopy level. The effect of rising temperature above the certain threshold required for photosynthesis decreases the productivity of terrestrial plants by closing the stomata in response to water stress induced by high leaf temperature and evapotranspiration. Experiments with enriched CO2 levels had often resulted in increased WUEs because of reduced stomatal conductance. Growth responses to increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations vary amongst the plants with different photosynthetic pathways. Changing precipitation patterns affect the WUE more through changing the seasonal water availability rather than changes in total annual rainfall as plant water needs vary with different growth stages. All these climatic changes as a whole are known to affect the global hydrological cycle through induced changes in soil moisture and evaporation. Soil management to conserve water in situ is essentially required to maximize the use of rainfall by increasing infiltration and storage using practices like conservation tillage, mulching, etc., and the crop management practices like crop rotation and agroforestry through optimization of limited available water supplies minimize the risk associated with changing climate.

Accordingly, biogas production is promoted worldwide in efforts to reduce carbon emissions and optimize the recovery of resources from waste streams. In this paper the biogas production from bioresidues collected in the capital area of Reykjavik was modelled in Aspen Plus v10. RESULTS: Municipal solid waste (MSW), food waste (FW) and lignocellulosic biomass (LCB) were the feedstocks used in this research. A total of 16 scenarios were simulated at thermophilic temperature conditions of 55 °C. Each scenario accounted for different inlet mass flows, varying the kind of feedstock, i.e. MSW, FW, LCB, or co-digestion of various feedstocks, using two model approaches: (i) one digestion stage and (ii) two stages coupled in series. Sizing, costing and environmental aspects were analysed for all the scenarios. A sensitivity analysis was carried out by changing the substrate concentration and studying its effect on the methane mass flow. Simulations showed biogas yields measured in millilitres per gram of volatile solids (VS) in the range 305.5–406.4 mL g−1 VS (single-stage approach); and biogas yields ranging from 64.78 to 358.8 mL g−1 VS (two-stage approach). Maximum methane yields were obtained using LCB as feedstock resulting in 106.0 mL g−1 VS. CONCLUSIONS: From a technical viewpoint the highest biogas yield is obtained when using MSW whereas optimum calorific value of biogas and electrical power potential is achieved working in co-digestion of various feedstocks. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry. © 2020 Society of Chemical Industry","anaerobic digestion; Aspen Plus; biogas; biomethane; simulation","Anaerobic digestion; Biogas; Carbon; Chemical industry; Feedstocks; Food waste; Mass transfer; Methane; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Biogas production; Electrical power potential; Environmental aspects; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Renewable energy source; Substrate concentrations; Thermophilic temperatures; Two stage approach; Municipal solid waste; biogas; cellulose; hemicellulose; lignocellulose; methane; anaerobic digestion; Article; biofuel production; biomass; carbonization; chemical reaction; controlled study; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental parameters; food waste; hydrolysis; Iceland; manure; municipal solid waste; nonhuman; organic waste; sensitivity analysis; simulation; soil erosion; substrate concentration; temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100046722

It is the first country to officially protect all its remaining mangrove forests and has embarked on an ambitious plan to restore 10,000 ha of wetland during the United Nations Decade of Ecosystem Restoration. One incentive for this conservation effort is a recognition, based on research mostly done elsewhere, of the importance of mangroves for carbon sequestration and storage. However, a lack of data on Sri Lankan mangrove carbon pools, especially on soil organic carbon, has been recognized as a major impediment to national climate change mitigation strategies. The current work examined both above and below-ground carbon stocks of five important mangrove forests in Sri Lanka (Rekawa, Puttalam-Kalpitiya, Pambala-Chilaw, Batticaloa and Negombo) which are situated in the three major climate zones (dry, intermediate and wet) and therefore sample the main climatic drivers of spatial variability. Above-ground carbon, below-ground root carbon and soil carbon stocks of mangroves in Sri Lanka ranged from 75.5 to 189.1 Mg C ha−1, 7.9 to 14.3 Mg C ha−1 and 643.6 to 1253.6 Mg C ha−1, respectively. The highest total mangrove carbon stock was recorded from the Rekawa lagoon which is in the intermediate climate zone (1455.4 Mg C ha−1) while the lowest was found in the Batticaloa lagoon in the dry zone (734.7 Mg C ha−1). Soil carbon stocks were substantially higher in the places where vegetation biomass and stand densities are high. Soil comprised 83–90% of the total mangrove carbon stocks at all sites, highlighting the large potential for release into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide if these habitats are disturbed. Overall, our study contributes important data that broadens our current understanding of how mangrove organic carbon pools vary spatially and with climatic zone. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change mitigation; Climatic drivers; Mangrove deforestation; Soil organic carbon; Stand density; Vegetation biomass","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Conservation; Digital storage; Ecosystems; Magnesium; Organic carbon; Restoration; Soils; Above and below-ground carbons; Above-ground carbons; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Ecosystem restoration; Organic carbon pools; Soil organic carbon; Spatial variability; Forestry; background level; carbon dioxide; carbon sequestration; climate variation; coastal lagoon; conservation planning; intertidal environment; mangrove; mitigation; organic carbon; soil carbon; wetland management; Batticaloa; Eastern Province [Sri Lanka]; North Western Province [Sri Lanka]; Puttalam; Sri Lanka; Matthiola; Rhizophoraceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100429324

Knowledge of the spatial–temporal patterns of solar radiation during the maize growing season is essential for farmers and extension technicians in their optimization of cropping choices and development of adaptation strategies for climate change. In this study, based on the observed solar radiation in six subregions of China, we analyzed the spatial distributions and temporal trends of incident solar radiation (SRi), beam solar radiation (SRb), and diffuse solar radiation (SRd) during 1961–2014. From 1961 to 1984, the annual SRi in most areas showed a downward trend, with a median value of −27.8 MJ m−2year−1, which is primarily due to a decrease in SRb. However, after 1985, 76% of locations had reversed to brightening. This finding is primarily due to an increase in SRd. The trends in SRi during the whole growing season (WGS) of maize changed by −12.4% to 18.3% during the past 30 years, and 74% of the selected locations showed an increasing trend. At most of the stations, SRb showed a decreasing trend during the WGS, and SRd showed an increasing trend. The trends of SRi, SRb, and SRd during the vegetative period and reproductive period of maize have generally followed a trend similar to the WGSs. Therefore, we conclude that annual solar radiation changed from dimming to brightening from 1961 to 2014 in China. Solar brightening occurred during the maize growing season, which was mainly caused by an increase in diffuse radiation. © 2021 The Authors.

Especially, high selectivity of carbon monoxide reduction (CORR) in competition with the hydrogen evolution reaction has been observed on high roughness electrocatalysts. However, the two well-known mechanisms, i.e., decreasing the energy barrier of CORR and increasing local pH, failed to understand the roughness-enhanced selectivity in a recent experiment. Herein we unravel the hidden mechanism by establishing a comprehensive kinetic model for CORR on catalysts with different roughness factors. We conclude that the roughness-enhanced CORR selectivity is actually kinetic controlled by local-electric-field-directed mass transfer of adsorbed species on the electrode surface. Several ways to optimize CORR selectivity are predicted.

Therefore, it is significant to study the distribution characteristics of regional PM2.5 and analyze the mutual influence relationship between it and some influencing factors including air humidity, wind speed, and atmospheric boundary conditions. Some scholars have studied the relationship between PM2.5 and the atmospheric planetary boundary layer or relative humidity. However, the relationships between air pollution and meteorological conditions in China has been extensively studied in recent years. Therefore, the association between the pollution and precipitation water vapor and wind speed in the northeast of China (e.g., Jilin and Heilongjiang province) could be strengthened. Considering all components in the atmosphere affecting each other and the ability of Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) and WRF-Chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulating all of the atmospheric parameters, we utilized the WRF and WRF-Chem to simulate the precipitable water vapor, wind speed, and PM2.5. Then first, the PM2.5 concentration values predicted from WRF-Chem are validated with those at the ground stations to evaluate the accuracy of WRF-Chem model. Second, the relationship analysis between the PM2.5 and wind speed or PWV was done. And the results demonstrate that the wind is helpful to decrease the severe air pollution in winter while the precipitable water vapor plays a small effect on the elimination of the particulate matter.

GHG emissions from the waste sector could rely on the disposal process greatly, and the corresponding GHG emission intensity (GHG emissions from per kg disposed MSW) might reflect the city's waste management level. Shanghai, as the popular megacity in China, has witnessed the evolution of the waste disposal processes from landfill dominated to incineration dominated from 2005 to 2015, and the detailed GHG emission estimation was implemented combining the method recommended by IPCC and the bottom-up method. It was found that landfill contributed to 81.88% of total GHG emissions from 2005 to 2015, while the GHG emissions from incineration plants increased from 1.8×108 to 3.8×108 kg CO2-eq (CO2 equivalent) in the same period, with the amount of incinerated MSW increasing from 1.02×109 to 2.50×109 kg. The GHG emission intensity of the MSW management system reached 0.363 kg CO2-eq per kg MSW in 2012 but declined to 0.354 kg in 2015. And the GHG emission intensity of incineration was lower than that of landfill and composting, which fluctuated between 0.147 and 0.177 kg CO2-eq per kg MSW. Both the scale and the operation conditions of the waste disposal facilities could influence the GHG emission intensity. With the implementation of waste source sorting and incineration dominated in disposal processes, around 54.07% of GHG emissions could be reduced under the 2030 NP (New policy) scenario. GHG emission intensity could be employed as an indicator for waste disposal development levels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Bottom-up method; GHG emission Intensity; IPCC; Scenario analysis; Shanghai; Waste disposal process","Carbon dioxide; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Municipal solid waste; Bottom up methods; Disposal process; GHG emission; Incineration plant; Msw managements; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Operation conditions; Waste disposal facilities; Waste incineration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101405124

For the 37 AMSs in central Beijing, the relationships between UHI, Wsr, and qr and six spatial morphological parameters (building height (BH), building density (BD), floor area ratio, sky view factor, frontal area index, and roughness length (RL)) and two land surface parameters (vegetation coverage and impervious cover) in the range of 200−3000 m from the station were studied. The scale effect of each parameter on local climate was also studied. The results showed that individually, these parameters account for 46.8–79.6 % of the change in UHI, 25.6–52.8 % of the change in Wsr, and 25.7–29.3 % of the change in qr. The impact of spatial morphological parameters on local climate has surpassed that of land surface parameters. The parameters that make the largest contributions to the annual average UHI, Wsr, and qr are RL, BH, and BD, respectively.

For this purpose, this study adopts a Logistic Mean Division Index (LMDI) model to explore the driving forces of the changes for the transport sector’s CO2 emissions from a temporal perspective during 2000–2017 and identifies the key factors of differences in the transport sector’s CO2 emissions of China’s 15 cities in four key years (i.e., 2000, 2005, 2010, and 2017) using a multi-regional spatial decomposition model (M-R). Based on the empirical results, it was found that the main forces for affecting CO2 emissions of the transport sector are not the same as those from temporal and spatial perspectives. Temporal decomposition results show that the income effect is the dominant factor inducing the increase of CO2 emissions in the transport sector, while the transportation intensity effect is the main factor for curbing the CO2 emissions. Spatial decomposition results demonstrate that income effect, energy intensity effect, transportation intensity effect, and transportation structure effect are important factors which result in enlarging the differences in city-level CO2 emissions. In addition, the less-developed cities and lower energy efficiency cities have greater potential to reduce CO2 emissions of the transport sector. Understanding the feature of CO2 emissions and the influencing factors of cities is critical for formulating city-level mitigation strategies of the transport sector in China. Overall, it is expected that the level of economic development is the main factor leading to the differences in CO2 emissions from a spatial-temporal perspective. © 2021, The Author(s).","Driving forces; Spatial decomposition; Temporal decomposition; Transport sector; Urban agglomerations","carbon dioxide; carbon emission; decomposition analysis; economic development; energy intensity; environmental economics; spatiotemporal analysis; China; carbon dioxide; China; city; economic development; traffic and transport; Carbon Dioxide; China; Cities; Economic Development; Transportation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099797766

To capture the transition process from fossil fuel to renewable energy, a flexible RIES, including the traditional energy system (TES) based on the coal and biomass based distributed energy system (BDES), was designed to meet a regional multiple energy demand. In this paper, we analyze multiple scenarios based on a new rural community in Dalian (China) to capture the relationship among the energy supply cost, increased share of biomass, system configuration transformation, and renewable subsidy according to regional CO2 emission abatement control targets. A mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model was developed to find the optimal solutions. The results indicated that a 40.58% increase in the share of biomass in the RIES was the most cost-effective way as compared to the separate TES and BDES. Based on the RIES with minimal cost, by setting a CO2 emission reduction control within 40%, the RIES could ensure a competitive total annual cost as compared to the TES. In addition, when the reduction control exceeds 40%, a subsidy of 53.83 to 261.26 RMB/t of biomass would be needed to cover the extra cost to further increase the share of biomass resource and decrease the CO2 emission. © 2021 by the authors.

However, little research has focused on the relationships among per capita CO2 emissions, real output, non-renewable and renewable energy, and urbanization in five Northeast Asian countries (China, Japan, Mongolia, Russia, and South Korea). In this study, panel methodologies have been used to investigate the relationships based on the 20-year period of 1995–2014. Six stationary tests and three co-integration methods indicate that the selected variables are first difference stationary and exhibit co-integration relationships. The long-run estimations reveal that disaggregated energy (both non-renewable and renewable) and urbanization increase CO2 emissions, while economic growth reduces CO2 emissions. To test the relationships between the selected variables, homogeneous Granger causality is implied. Bidirectional causality is only found between non-renewable energy and CO2 emissions, while unidirectional causalities exists between the other selected variables. The study results suggest that governments should allocate urban resources reasonably, to make smart urban. Policymakers should pay more attention to non-renewable and renewable energy. Non-renewable energy needs to be more efficient, while renewable energy needs to be popularized. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO2 emissions; Homogeneous causality; Renewable energy; Urbanization","Carbon dioxide; Economic and social effects; Economics; Energy utilization; Asian countries; Economic growths; Economic output; Granger Causality; Non-renewable; Non-renewable energy; Northeast Asia; Renewable energies; Urban growth",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099202035

The large-scale clouds, which form the core of the scheme, are diagnosed from relative humidity. In addition, the marine low stratus clouds, typically found off the west coast of continents over subtropical oceans, are determined largely as a function of inversion strength. A freeze-dry adjustment based on a simple function of specific humidity is also available to reduce an excessive cloud bias in polar regions. Other cloud properties, such as the effective radius of cloud droplet and cloud liquid water content, are specified as simple functions of temperature. All of these features are userconfigurable. The cloud scheme is implemented in Isca, a modeling framework designed to enable the construction of GCMs at varying levels of complexity, but could readily be adapted to other GCMs. Simulations using the scheme with realistic continents generally capture the observed structure of cloud fraction and cloud radiative effect (CRE), as well as its seasonal variation. Specifically, the explicit low-cloud scheme improves the simulation of shortwave CREs over the eastern subtropical oceans by increasing the cloud fraction and cloud water path. The freeze-dry adjustment alleviates the longwave CRE biases in polar regions, especially in winter. However, the longwave CRE in tropical regions and shortwave CRE over the extratropics are both still too strong compared to observations. Nevertheless, this simple cloud scheme provides a suitable basis for examining the impacts of clouds on climate in idealized modeling frameworks. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Infrastructure development is conducive to reducing transport emissions. However, decision making regarding the development of port-hinterland transport infrastructures is complicated because port throughputs for different types of cargo change with economic structural changes (ESCs) in the port's hinterland. Therefore, this study develops a hybrid econometric and system dynamic model to explore the impact of ESCs in the hinterland on a port's throughput and to formulate suitable infrastructure decisions to reduce CO2 emissions from port-hinterland transport. The hybrid model is applied to the Qingdao port and its hinterland transport in Shandong Province, China. The results show that long-term CO2 emissions from port-hinterland transport will increase significantly because Shandong's ESCs will lead to a notable increase in the freight volume of containers, despite a concurrent decrease in the freight volume of iron ore. To reduce port-hinterland transport emissions under ESCs, facilitating railway transport for containers prioritizes over other options. The results also reveal that whether the ESCs are considered will lead to different infrastructure decisions, and whether life-cycle emissions of infrastructure are considered may lead to different priorities of infrastructure options. The findings indicate that holistic view and collaboration among government entities and transport-related stakeholders should be emphasized in the decision making of transport infrastructure development. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Emissions; Hinterland transport; Port; Structural changes; Throughput; Transport infrastructure","Containers; Decision making; Freight transportation; Iron ores; Life cycle; Railroad transportation; Railroads; Throughput; CO$-2$/ emission; Decisions makings; Emission; Hinterland transport; Infrastructure development; Port; Shandong province; Structural change; Transport emissions; Transport infrastructure; Carbon dioxide; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; infrastructural development; railway transport; traffic emission; transportation infrastructure; transportation system; China; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104973751

We find that China's Key Cities for Air Pollution Control (KCAPC) policy effectively lowered sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions by approximately 26%. The new environmental regulation significantly reduced manufacturing labor demand by approximately 3%. Most importantly, firms reduce pollution emission mainly by upgrading production technology so the decline in labor is partly due to the increase in labor productivity brought about by technological progress.

Understanding the characteristics of air pollution and providing scientific support to mitigate such pollution are urgent matters. This study investigated the variations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, and CO in Linfen between December 1, 2019 and February 29, 2020. The mean concentrations of PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, MDA8 (the maximum daily 8-h average) O3, and CO were 106.2, 139.4, 47.2, 41.0, 57.0 μg m−3, and 1.8 mg m−3, respectively. Large amounts of pollutants emitted by coal burning, industry, vehicles, and residents contributed to air pollution. Unfavorable meteorological conditions, such as lower temperature, weaker wind, higher relative humidity, and reduced planetary boundary layer height, made the situation worse. Fireworks and firecrackers set off to celebrate traditional Chinese festivals caused the concentration of PM pollutants to spike, with the maximum daily mean concentration of PM2.5 reached 314 μg m−3 and the peak hourly value reached 378.0 μg m−3. Suspensions of commercial and social activities due to COVID-19 reduced anthropogenic emissions, mainly from industry and transportation, which decreased the level of air pollutants other than O3. Analyses involving backward trajectory cluster, the potential source contribution function, and concentration weighted trajectory demonstrated that PM2.5 pollution mainly came from local emissions in Shanxi Province and regional transport from Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, Hebei, Henan, and Gansu provinces. Shanxi and its surrounding provinces should adopt measures such as tightening environmental management standards, promoting the use of renewable energy, and adjusting the transportation structure to reduce regional emissions. This study will help policy-makers draft plans and policies to reduce air pollution in Linfen. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air pollution; Linfen; Meteorological parameters; PM2.5; Potential source","Boundary layer flow; Boundary layers; Coal industry; Environmental management; Nitrogen oxides; Pollution control; Sulfur dioxide; Anthropogenic emissions; Environmental management standards; Higher relative humidity; Meteorological condition; Planetary boundary layers; Potential source contribution function; Transportation structures; Use of renewable energies; Air quality; carbon monoxide; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); particulate matter; pollutant transport; seasonal variation; source apportionment; air pollution; air quality; Article; China; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; environmental management; industry; meteorology; nonhuman; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; policy; pollutant; relative humidity; renewable energy; social behavior; temperature; traffic and transport; urban area; winter; air pollutant; environmental monitoring; human; particulate matter; China; Gansu; Hebei; Henan; Linfen; Nei Monggol; Shaanxi; Shanxi; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; China; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104074134

This study uses a difference-in-differences model to estimate the extent to which China's Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS), which directly addresses CO2 emissions, has also generated cobenefits by reducing PM2.5. Using monthly PM2.5 concentration and weather data for 297 Chinese cities from January 2005 to December 2017, we find that (1) China's ETS has reduced PM2.5 concentrations by 4.8%, and this reduction effect is strongest in summer. The results are confirmed by robustness tests including propensity score matching, mahalanobis distance matching, two placebo tests, and controlling atmospheric policies. (2) The ETS pilots have positive spillovers on neighboring nonpilot cities within 300 km of the pilot cites, especially for those downwind neighboring nonpilot cities, and the ETS's cobenefits are primarily a result of firms adopting abatement activities and adjusting industrial structure. (3) The cobenefits of China's ETS pilots are greater in regions with larger carbon trading volume and higher carbon trading price. (4) The reduction in PM2.5 concentration caused by China's ETS may have avoided 23,363 deaths and saved $41.38 billion annually in GDP. ©","Carbon trading; Difference-in-differences; ETS; PM2.5","Carbon; Difference-in-differences models; Emissions Trading Scheme; Industrial structures; Local air pollutions; Low-carbon policies; Mahalanobis distances; Positive spillovers; Propensity score matching; Emission control; carbon dioxide; fossil fuel; rain; sulfur dioxide; carbon; carbon emission; emission control; emissions trading; environmental economics; particulate matter; air pollution control; air quality; Article; atmospheric pressure; benchmarking; carbon footprint; China; city; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; corporate finance; economic development; education; environmental policy; environmental temperature; evaporation; geographic mapping; greenhouse gas; gross national product; humidity; income; industrial production; industry; marketing; particulate matter 2.5; patent; pollution monitoring; population density; seasonal variation; soot; spatiotemporal analysis; summer; time factor; velocity; wastewater; weather; wind speed; air pollution; China; particulate matter; prevention and control; China; Air Pollution; Carbon; China; Cities; Industry; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106535195

A panel of characterizations was carried out to understand the structure, morphology and surface chemistry of the Rf periodic mesoporous organosilica (Rf-PMO) spherical nanosensors. For the Rf-PMO materials, the doped silica nanoparticles exhibit strong fluorescence emission at 520 nm, on account that the greater steric hindrances and the more separated state of π-conjugate planer platforms between Rf molecules embedded within the silica framework can both enhance the fluorescence emission and reduce the self-quenching of fluorescence produced by stacking aggregation of Rf. The electron spin resonance (ESR) spectra prove that the prepared Rf-PMO materials can participate in the redox reaction through electron transfer with the pesticide ferbam. Utilized the reducing reaction mechanism of Rf-PMO, it is applied to detect pesticide ferbam with high sensitivity and selectivity, with the limit of detection (LOD) in aqueous solution as low as 6.97 × 10−9 M. Moreover, the X-ray absorption near-edge spectroscopy (XANES) of Fe K-edge shows a coordination structure through the interaction between iron ions from ferbam and O and N atoms in Rf-PMO. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) further reveals the redox mechanism. Therefore, the designed and prepared Rf-PMO is potentially valuable to food safety monitoring involving ferbam as the nanosensor, due to its hypersensitivity and selectivity. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Ferbam; Fluorescence; Nanosensor; Periodic mesoporous organosilica; Riboflavin-5'-phosphate sodium","Coordination reactions; Electron transport properties; Fluorescence; Iron metallography; Magnetic moments; Metal ions; Morphology; Nanosensors; organic-inorganic materials; Pesticides; Redox reactions; Salts; Silica; Silica nanoparticles; Sodium; Surface chemistry; X ray absorption; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Coordination structures; Fabrication and characterizations; Fluorescence emission; Optical nanosensors; Organic-inorganic hybrid materials; Periodic mesoporous organosilicas; Sensitive detection; X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy; Electron spin resonance spectroscopy; flavine mononucleotide; free radical; pesticide; silica nanoparticle; sodium dihydrogen phosphate; Article; catalysis; comparative study; controlled study; desorption; electron spin resonance; fluorescence; limit of detection; nanofabrication; oxidation reduction reaction; pore size distribution; priority journal; proton nuclear magnetic resonance; quantum yield; reaction analysis; stereospecificity; X ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy; X ray photoemission spectroscopy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101771265

Evaluation of ecological quality is essential to implementation of interventions for adapting to climate change and alleviating human–nature land-use conflicts in the Anthropocene era. However, the temporal and spatial characteristics of island ecological quality, including variation arising from anthropogenic perturbations, climate change effects, and spatiotemporal heterogeneity, are rarely given serious attention. This study compares Xiamen Island and Kinmen Island, two neighboring islands with pronounced differences in urban density, adopting a Remote Sensing Ecological Index (RSEI) to describe the spatiotemporal differences in island ecological quality. The results show that the RSEI was positively correlated with greenness and humidity and negatively correlated with heat and dryness. Despite the fact that Xiamen Island has experienced extensive urban expansion and rapid population growth, its ecological quality has remained stable and even improved slightly, which mainly due to scientific urban planning. Despite the ecological advantages of its less urban setting, Kinmen Island has suffered reduced ecological quality due to deterioration of natural conditions, climate warming, and increasing human activity. These research findings provide empirical evidence for the need for scientific and systematic urban planning in high-density urban areas and serves as an important reference for planners and decision-makers for effective improvement in the ecological quality of Kinmen Island. © 2021 The Author(s)","Ecological environment evaluation; Islands; Principal component analysis; Remote sensing ecological index; Urban planning","Decision making; Deterioration; Developing countries; Ecology; Land use; Landforms; Population statistics; Quality control; Remote sensing; Urban growth; Comparative analysis; Ecological indices; Land use conflicts; Natural conditions; Rapid population growth; Spatiotemporal evolution; Spatiotemporal heterogeneities; Temporal and spatial; Climate change; Anthropocene; climate change; climate effect; comparative study; decision making; environmental quality; spatiotemporal analysis; urban planning; China; Fujian; Quemoy; Taiwan; Xiamen Island",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100556657

Large nitrogen fertilizer inputs in summer maize fields on the North China Plain (NCP) lead to large N2O emissions. N2O emissions can be mitigated using 3,4-dimethylpyrazole phosphate (DMPP), but the efficiency and microbial mechanisms of this mitigation at different nitrogen rates remain poorly understood. To evaluate the efficiency of N2O emission mitigation by DMPP at different nitrogen rates and to explore its mechanisms at the microbial level, we monitored the dynamic changes in mineral and N2O fluxes and analysed the abundance and community structure of ammonia oxidizers. We found that DMPP significantly inhibited the oxidation of ammonium (NH4+) to nitrate (NO3−) and thus maintained NH4+ concentrations but decreased the peak value of NO3− concentrations. Total N2O emissions were increased by 6.5-fold, 13.2-fold and 26.7-fold in fields with 112.5 kg N ha−1, 225 kg N ha−1 and 337.5 kg N ha−1, respectively, compared with fields with no nitrogen applied. Nitrogen increased the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and decreased that of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA), whereas DMPP exhibited the opposite effects. Therefore, AOB could be the dominant N2O emission contributors in nitrogen-treated soils. Sequencing results suggested that all AOB belong to the Nitrosospira and Nitrosomonas nitrosa groups, and all AOA fell within the Nitrososphaera group. In both AOB and AOA communities, changes in the second-largest cluster after the application of nitrogen fertilizer and DMPP were more pronounced than those in the largest cluster. The potential functional clusters of AOB and AOA were Nitrosospira cluster 3b and Nitrososphaera cluster 4.1, respectively. This study showed that nitrogen and DMPP both affected the abundance and structure of ammonia-oxidizer communities, which may contribute to the variations in N2O emissions from croplands. Highlights: Role of soil microorganisms in the efficiency of DMPP to reduce N2O emissions under different N inputs was explored. N input increased N2O emissions and DMPP reduced N2O emissions N and DMPP affect N2O emission via a changed key cluster of ammonia oxidizers.

We found both short-and long-term observational relationships with a range of regulated pollutants, although only two studies considered both cases (i.e., infections) and deaths within a common analytical framework. Most of these studies were limited to a few months of the pandemic period. Statistically significant relationships were found more often for PM2.5 and NO2 than for other regulated pollutants, but no rationale was suggested for such short-term relationships; latency was seldom considered for long-term relationships. It was also unclear whether confounding had been adequately controlled in either type of study. Studies of air quality improvement following lockdowns found more robust relationships with local (CO, NO2 ) rather than regional (PM2.5, O3 ) pollutants, but meteorological confounding was seldom considered. Only one of seven studies of airborne virus transmission reported actual measurements. Overall, we found the existing body of literature to be more suggestive than definitive. Due to these various deficiencies, we assembled a new state-level database of cumulative COVID-19 cases and deaths through March 2021 with a range of potential predictor variables and performed linear regression analyses on various combinations. As single predictors, we found significant (p &lt; 0.05) relationships between cumulative cases and household crowding (+), education (−), face-mask usage (−), or voting Republican (+). For cumulative deaths, we found significant relationships with education (−), black race (+), or previous levels of PM2.5 (+). NOx (+), and elemental carbon (EC, +). We found no relationships between long-term air quality and cumulative COVID-19 cases. Our associations linking air pollution with COVID-19 mortality were not statistically different from those for all-cause mortality in previous studies. In multiple mortality regressions combining air pollution, race, and education, NOx and EC remained significant but PM2.5 did not. We concluded that the current worldwide emphasis on PM2.5 is misplaced. We predicted air pollutant effects of a few percentage points, but individual differences between races, political identification, and post-graduate education were of the order of factors of 2 to 4. In general, the factors predicting infection were personal and related to COVID-19 exposure, while those predicting subsequent mortality tended to be more situational and related to geography. Overall, we concluded that how you live is more important than where you live. Copyright: © 2021 by the authors.

However, compared to carbon flux regulating factors in vegetated habitats, those in unvegetated tidal flats are not well understood, particularly in terms of their cause-effect relationships. Maximum gross primary production (GPPm), net primary production (NPP) and total respiration (TR) during emersion at noon when the irradiance level was at the saturation level for photosynthesis in nine unvegetated tidal flats across the Taiwan Strait in tropical and subtropical regions were determined in winter and summer from 2011 to 2016 to examine the direct and indirect relationships between sediment characteristics and carbon fluxes by using structural equation models (SEM). Most of the GPPm and NPP values were higher in winter than in summer. Conversely, the TR values were higher in summer than in winter. The NPP values at some sites shifted to negative values in summer, indicating the sites were carbon sources. The values of GPPm, TR and NPP for the tidal flats all increased significantly with increasing sediment mud content. The SEM results showed that the sediment mud content directly increased GPPm or indirectly increased GPPm via a compositional shift in benthic microalgae. The sediment mud content also directly increased TR or indirectly increased TR via increased organic matter content. The contribution of benthic microalgal and macrofaunal biomass to TR was relatively minor. This result suggests that primary production was stimulated mainly by the organic matter content rather than by increased microalgal biomass. With the integrated SEM framework, our results showed mechanistic evidence of how sediment mud content acted as a critical factor regulating carbon fluxes in unvegetated tidal flats. © Copyright © 2021 Lin, Chiu, Lin and Lin.","benthic metabolism; gross primary production; microphytobenthos; net primary production; respiration; structural equation model",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107037701

In recent years, emissions of hazardous air pollutants (HAPs) caused by the rapid biomass industrialization have attracted increasing attention. To investigate the characteristics of HAPs emitted from biomass power plants in China, a multiple-year comprehensive emission inventory including NOx, SO2, PM, PM10, PM2.5, and trace elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Zn) has been established for the period of 2006–2017. As a result of the emission standard (GB13223-2011), emissions of conventional HAPs have declined since 2014. The results show that national total emissions in 2017 were estimated at 29,516.0 t of NOx, 14,192.1 t of SO2, 4100.7 t of PM, 2353.9 t of PM10, 1630.6 t of PM2.5, 3057.2 kg of As, 1622.8 kg of Cd, 8285.8 kg of Cr, 54,443.4 kg of Cu, 132.9 kg of Hg, 66,325.8 kg of Pb, and 175,587.9 kg of Zn, respectively. The majority of HAPs emissions have been concentrated in eastern, northeastern, and central areas of mainland China. Shandong, Heilongjiang, and Anhui represent the top three provinces with the highest HAPs emissions from 2012 to 2017. Besides, the future emissions in 2025 and 2035 under the ultra-low emission policy are predicted with scenario analysis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Biomass direct-fired power plant; Emission inventory; Hazardous air pollutants; Scenario analysis; Spatial distribution; Trace elements","Agricultural robots; Agricultural wastes; Agriculture; Biohazards; Biomass; Hazardous materials; Nitrogen oxides; Power plants; Sulfur dioxide; Trace elements; Atmospheric emission inventory; Biomass power plants; Emission inventories; Emission standard; Future perspectives; Hazardous air pollutants; Low carbon energies; Spatial variations; Air pollution; arsenic; cadmium; carbon; chromium; copper; lead; mercury; nitric oxide; sulfur dioxide; trace element; zinc; agricultural emission; air quality; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; pollution monitoring; pollution policy; power generation; power plant; spatial distribution; spatial variation; trace element; air pollutant; Article; biomass energy; China; concentration (parameter); controlled study; electric power plant; environmental policy; hazardous waste; industrialization; particulate matter; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; prediction; priority journal; recycling; technology; trend study; Anhui; China; Heilongjiang; Shandong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098990928

Utilizing long-term monitoring data obtained from the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, we found that PSR J1420-6048 has shown γ-ray flux variation and we also detected four glitches between 2008 and 2019. Two of the glitches are previously unknown, and their γ-ray spectrum also shows variability between each glitch. Because the results might be contaminated by background sources, we discuss whether the observed changes in flux and spectra were caused by artificial misallocations of photons from a nearby pulsar wind nebula (HESS J1420-607) and a pulsar (PSR J1418-6058), or by a change of the emission geometry from the target pulsar itself. We examine the correlation of the flux changes and the alternating pulse structure to investigate whether the emission geometry in the outer magnetosphere was changing. By assuming that the observational features did not totally result from the background environment, we compare our results with similar phenomena observed in other γ-ray pulsars. We propose that a strong crust crack can cause timing anomaly of a neutron star, which can affect the particle accelerations or pair creation regions, resulting in the changes of emission behaviours. © 2021 The Author(s) Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.","gamma-rays: stars; magnetic fields; methods: data analysis; pulsars: individual: PSR J1420-6048; stars: neutron; time","Gamma rays; Magnetosphere; Ultraviolet spectroscopy; Gamma rays: stars; Gamma-rays; Long-term monitoring datum; Magnetic-field; Methods.

This study attempted to validate a hypothesis formulated using a mass-flow inventory model, which suggested that ""Barn only"" housing facilities without open lots might have a lower NH3 loss potential than ""Barn+Lot"" facilities with both dairy barns and open lots. NH3 emissions from two ""Barn+Lot"" dairy farms and one ""Barn only"" dairy farm were measured using a combination of an inverse dispersion modeling technique and an open-path laser in summer and winter. It was found that the uncertainty of emission estimates owing to the spatial variation of animal densities in the three dairy farms was 8–12%, and the total uncertainty of the NH3 emission estimates owing to spatial variation in animal densities, distortion of wind flow by animal buildings, and the inverse dispersion calculation was estimated to be less than 30%. The NH3 emission rates obtained from the ""Barn only"" farm (28–43 g head−1 d − 1) were lower than the rates from the conventional ""Barn+Lot"" farms (93–184 g head−1 d − 1), indicating emission mitigation of 71–76%. In comparison with the conventional dairy farms, the ""Barn only"" dairy farm had a lower NH3 loss potential, most likely due to the greater animal density, frequent manure removal, and lower crude protein feed. However, more field measurements of such comparisons are necessary to provide robust suggestions for mitigating environmental risks. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Ammonia; Dairy cattle; Housing facility; Inventory methodology; Inverse dispersion technique","ammonia; cattle; cold front; dispersion; emission inventory; housing conditions; laser method; manure; protein; recycling; spatial variation; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100716598

This study explored the impacts of large-scale synoptic weather circulations on O3 concentration in Guangzhou, in a particular focus on high O3 pollution episodes. Twelve local weather types were clustered based on Lamb-Jenkinson weather types (LWTs). Analyses showed that LWTs strongly impacted daily O3 concentrations: A, AS, CN, and N+ weather types were likely associated with high ozone concentrations, while the ozone levels were relatively low under C, CE, CS, and S+ types. LWTs could explain 30–40% of the inter-annual variability of O3 concentration during the dry season. Numerical model simulations further demonstrated that continuous type A weather was the leading LWT correlated with high O3 concentrations, while type C weather was the predominant type correlated with low O3 concentrations. CMIP5 model results showed that occurrences of weather type A would increase by about 25% in the high emission scenario over the 2020–2069 period, which might worsen the O3 pollution in Guangzhou in the future. The increase in frequency weather type A would not be significant under the low emission scenario during the same period. Therefore, we should strictly implement the global emission reduction plan to prevent the change of weather circulation caused by climate change from aggravating ozone pollution in the future. The strong link between O3 concentrations and LWT frequencies makes the daily occurrence of LWTs a useful predictor for episodes of high O3 pollution and makes annual frequencies of LWTs good indicators of the inter-annual variability of the O3 concentration. These results are useful in efforts to predict O3 concentrations, providing a reliable weather forecast is available. © 2020, Korean Meteorological Society and Springer Nature B.V.","Guangzhou; Heavy pollution; Lamb-Jenkinson weather types (LWTs); O3 concentration",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081922305

Less is understood about susceptibility of adults with a history of CVD and subsequent PM2.5-related CVD events and whether current regulation levels for PM2.5 are protective for this population. METHODS AND RESULTS: This retrospective cohort study included 96 582 Kaiser Permanente Northern California adults with a history of stroke or acute myocardial infarction. Outcome, covariate, and address data obtained from electronic health records were linked to time-varying 1-year mean PM2.5 exposure estimates based on residential locations. Cox proportional hazard models estimated risks of stroke, acute myocardial infarction, and cardiovascular mortality associated with PM2.5 exposure, adjusting for multiple covariates. Secondary analyses estimated risks below federal and state regulation levels (12 µg/m3 for 1-year mean PM2.5 ). A 10-µg/m3 increase in 1-year mean PM2.5 exposure was associated with an increase in risk of cardiovascular mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 1.20; 95% CI, 1.11–1.30), but no increase in risk of stroke or acute myocardial infarction. Analyses of &lt;12 µg/m3 showed increased risk for CVD mortality (HR, 2.31; 95% CI, 1.96–2.71), stroke (HR, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.09– 1.83]), and acute myocardial infarction (HR, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.21–1.89) per 10-µg/m3 increase in 1-year mean PM2.5 . CONCLUSIONS: Adults with a history of CVD are susceptible to the effects of PM2.5 exposure, particularly on CVD mortality. Increased risks observed at exposure levels &lt;12 µg/m3 highlight that current PM2.5 regulation levels may not be protective for this susceptible population. © 2021 The Authors.","Air pollution; Cardiovascular disease; Long-term; Myocardial infarction; Particulate matter; Recurrent events; Stroke","acute heart infarction; adult; aged; air pollution; Article; body mass; California; cardiovascular disease; cardiovascular mortality; cardiovascular risk; cerebrovascular accident; clinical outcome; cohort analysis; comorbidity; controlled study; disease association; electronic medical record; environmental exposure; female; government regulation; human; ischemic heart disease; long term exposure; major clinical study; male; maximum allowable concentration; medicaid; medical history; medical record review; middle aged; neighborhood; particulate matter 2.5; proportional hazards model; race; recurrent disease; residential area; retrospective study; risk; secondary analysis; sensitivity analysis; smoking; susceptible population; young adult; adolescent; adverse event; cerebrovascular accident; clinical trial; electronic health record; follow up; heart infarction; morbidity; multicenter study; particulate matter; procedures; risk assessment; risk factor; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; California; Cardiovascular Diseases; Electronic Health Records; Environmental Exposure; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Morbidity; Myocardial Infarction; Particulate Matter; Retrospective Studies; Risk Assessment; Risk Factors; Stroke; Young Adult",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106552235

A larger specific surface area of biochar may enhance the activities of nitrous oxide (N2O)-reducing microbes, thereby mitigating N2O emission; however, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. A 56-day incubation assay was performed with five treatments: no addition, urea only, and addition of three types of biochars (with different specific surface areas: 1193, 2023, and 2773 m2 g−1) combined with urea. N2O emission increased with the specific surface area of biochar up to 2023 m2 g−1 and decreased thereafter by 37% as compared with the urea only addition. By increasing soil pH, C/N ratio, nitrogen availability, and cation exchange capacity, the biochar with the largest specific surface area decreased soil N2O emission by affecting the diversity, abundance, and composition of total bacteria and N2O-producing microbial communities. A larger specific surface area of biochar correlated with a higher abundance of nitrogen-fixing (nifH), -nitrifying (amoA), and -denitrifying (nirK, nirS, and nosZ) genes. An increased abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria and archaea, in the biochar with a smaller specific surface area, resulted in higher N2O emission. As the abundance of nosZ increased, the addition of the biochar with the largest specific surface area resulted in a higher ratio of nosZ/(amoA + nirS + nirK), leading to decreased N2O emission. Furthermore, the abundance of nifH, amoA, nirK, and nosZ on biochar (extraction from soil after 56-day incubation) was positively correlated with that in soil. Thus, the relative specific surface area of biochar should be taken into consideration when using it in agriculture, as our results show that biochars with larger specific surface areas decrease N2O emission by recruiting N2O-reducing microbes and upregulating the abundance of nitrogen-fixing, -nitrifying, and -denitrifying genes. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Biochar; N2O emission; N2O-related functional genes; Nitrogen; nosZ; Specific surface area","Ammonia; Bacteria; Denitrification; Genes; Metabolism; Nitrification; Nitrogen fixation; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Specific surface area; Urea; Archaeon; Bio chars; Large specific surface areas; N$-2$/O; N2O emission; N2O-related functional gene; Nitrous oxide; Nosz; Specific surface; Surface area; Nitrogen; abundance estimation; biochar; denitrification; microbial activity; nitrogen fixation; nitrous oxide; soil nitrogen; urea; Archaea; Nitrosomonadales",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102973265

Although the reduction of N2O to nitrogen gas can control emissions, the factors impacting the enzymes involved have not been fully explored. The current study investigated the abundance and diversity of genes involved in nitrogen cycling (primarily denitrification) under four agricultural management practices (no tillage [NT], conventional tillage [CT], reduced input, biologically-based). The work involved examining soil shotgun sequencing data for nine genes (napA, narG, nirK, nirS, norB, nosZ, nirA, nirB, nifH). For each gene, relative abundance values, diversity and richness indices, and taxonomic classification were determined. Additionally, the genes associated with nitrogen metabolism (defined by the KEGG hierarchy) were examined. The data generated were statistically compared between the four management practices. The relative abundance of four genes (nifH, nirK, nirS, and norB) were significantly lower in the NT treatment compared to one or more of the other soils. The abundance values of napA, narG, nifH, nirA, and nirB were not significantly different between NT and CT. The relative abundance of nirS was significantly higher in the CT treatment compared to the others. Diversity and richness values were higher for four of the nine genes (napA, narG, nirA, nirB). Based on nirS/nirK ratios, CT represents the highest N2O consumption potential in four soils. In conclusion, the microbial communities involved in nitrogen metabolism were sensitive to different agricultural practices, which in turn, likely has implications for N2O emissions. Key points: • Four genes were less abundant in NT compared to one or more of the others soils (nifH, nirK, nirS, norB). • The most abundant sequences for many of the genes classified within the Proteobacteria. • Higher diversity and richness indices were observed for four genes (napA, narG, nirA, nirB). • Based on nirS/nirK ratios, CT represents the highest N2O consumption potential. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","nirK; nirS; Nitrous oxide; norB; nosZ","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Metabolism; Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Soils; Agricultural management practice; Agricultural practices; Consumption potential; Conventional tillage; Long-term ecological research; Management practices; Microbial communities; Ozone depleting substances; Genes; carbonate dehydratase; contig; ferredoxin nitrite reductase; hydroxylamine oxidase; nitrate; nitrate reductase; nitrate reductase (NADH); nitric oxide reductase; nitrite reductase; nitrite reductase [NAD(P)H]; nitrogen; nitrous oxide reductase; unspecific monooxygenase; nitrous oxide; agricultural management; diversity index; fertilizer; microbial community; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; relative abundance; species diversity; Actinobacteria; Actinoplanes; agricultural management; Alphaproteobacteria; Article; Betaproteobacteria; Bradyrhizobium; Burkholderia; comparative study; controlled study; conventional tillage; Deltaproteobacteria; denitrification; ecology; Flavobacteria; Gammaproteobacteria; gene; Leptothrix; metagenome; microbial community; Mycobacterium; nifh gene; nirk gene; nirs gene; nitrogen cycling; nitrogen fixation; nitrogen metabolism; Nitrospira; Nocardioides; nonhuman; norb gene; Paraburkholderia; phylogeny; Pseudonocardia; shotgun sequencing; microbiology; nitrogen cycle; soil; Midwest; United States; Proteobacteria; Denitrification; Nitrogen; Nitrogen Cycle; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105972396

This paper aims to estimate the CO2 emission efficiency and the potential emission reduction of the Paris Agreement contracting countries and identify the key influencing factors of CO2 emission efficiency for the period of 1991-2014. A nonradial directional distance function, the metafrontier approach, and the bootstrapped truncated regression model are used. The following are the main conclusions: (1) China makes the highest annual potential CO2 emission reduction of 2133.13 billion tons. (2) The technology gap appears to be a major contributor to the potential CO2 emission reductions in the low income group (82.87%) and the lower-middle income group (66.01%), and thus these economies should pursue technological innovation to improve carbon emission efficiency; the potential CO2 emission reductions in other groups are mainly the result of management inefficiency (with 57.52% and 78.38% of potential emission reductions by the upper-middle income and high income countries coming from management inefficiency). Therefore, some countries in the specific income group exhibit different emission reduction focus. (3) According to a regression analysis on the CO2 emission efficiency contributing factors, the progress of total factor productivity and improvement of management level can improve the CO2 emission efficiency. This study might be the first attempt to decompose the potential CO2 emission reduction of these countries and provides each country with targeted, effective emission reduction priorities. © 2021 World Scientific Publishing Company.","Carbon dioxide emission; directional distance function; metafrontier and group frontiers; Paris agreement; reduction potential",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105120079

We present the results of archeobotanical analysis from 58 soil samples collected from 12 recently investigated sites located in the Luoyang Basin, and recovered 5290 carbonized plant remains from 9 sites dating to the Late Yangshao period. We compared our novel dataset with previous archeobotanical date, compiling a total of 196 samples from 58 sites in central and western Henan Province. During the Early Yangshao period (5000–4200 BC), a nascent, extensive agricultural economy based primarily on broomcorn millet, with lesser foxtail millet and rice, was developing in small settlements (&lt;0.2 km2) in the loess tablelands and valleys of western Henan province. However, the population pressure—rather than environmental degradation—drove the “foxtail millet-broomcorn millet substitution” during the Middle Yangshao period (4200–3500BC). The intensive agriculture based mainly on foxtail millet facilitated the development of social complexity in the region, as demonstrated by the emergence of size-graded agricultural settlements of medium (0.2–0.6 km2) and large (&gt; 0.6 km2) scale. Notably, millets tend to be less ubiquitous in these larger settlements compared to smaller ones, with differences in millet ubiquity between sites increasing over time. The local surface hydrology influenced by paleoclimatic changes prompted the spread of agriculture from higher loess tablelands and valleys during the early Yangshao period into more marginal loess tablelands and plains by the Middle and Late Yangshao periods. Rice cultivation is concentrated in valley areas and appears to have been closely tied to environments with better hydrothermal conditions. Our research shows that climatic conditions during the Holocene fostered the development of agriculture during the Yangshao Culture period and that the distribution of settlements throughout this time was influenced by highly localized geomorphologic environments delimiting the distribution of crops. The rise of agriculture promoted the formation of complex and stratified economies in the Yangshao Culture period and it was the intensification and elaboration of these new economic and social systems that led to later transformation in agricultural structures and settlement sizes. © Copyright © 2021 Li, Zhang, Zhang and Zhao.","central and western Henan Province; foxtail millet-broomcorn millet substitution; paleoenvironment; social complexity; Valley-Rice Planting; Yangshao Culture","Agricultural robots; Landforms; Sediments; Agricultural economy; Central chinas; Climatic conditions; Hydrothermal conditions; Local surfaces; Population pressure; Rice cultivation; Social systems; Cultivation; agricultural economics; agricultural history; complexity; millet; paleoenvironment; rice; social history; China; Henan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107268728

This paper purposes to evaluate the spillover effect of Chinese ETS policy with the data of 30 provinces’ carbon emissions in China by China-MRIO model and input-output analysis. The MRIO model provides the change in production value in each region in the intermediate demand and final demand. 2012 and 2015 were selected as case study years to highlight the spillover effects of ETS policy. The results show that some pilot regions such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and Chongqing reduced their directed CO2 emissions while Guangdong and Hubei increased their directed CO2 compared to 2012. However, there were places like Hebei, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, and Xinjiang that undertook a mass of embodied CO2 emissions which were majorly caused by providing intermediate products. Similarly, the pilot regions transferred out CO2 emissions by using a good deal of intermediate products. Thus, it is argued that carbon transfer evaluation can provide scientific support for carbon allowance formulating and it is important for policymakers to consider embodied carbon emissions in intermediate product trading when allocating carbon allowance under the market strength of ETS. © Copyright © 2021 Li, Wang, Liao and Wen.","carbon emissions trading scheme; carbon transfer; effect evaluation; MRIO model; spillover effect","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Commerce; Emission control; Carbon allowances; Carbon emissions; Embodied carbons; Emissions Trading Scheme; Global climate changes; Input output analysis; Intermediate product; Spillover effects; Carbon",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107379351

Characterization with transmission electron microscope (TEM) and scanning electron microscope indicated that nanoscale FeOX distributed uniformly on carbon substrate, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and high resolution TEM characterization proved that the loaded FeOX was high crystallinity of Fe3O4 and α-Fe0. Bisphenol A (BPA) was used to investigate the degradation performance of BAC/FeOX activating peroxydisulfate (PDS). The ratio of raw materials affected degradation efficiency of BPA intensively through the content, valence state, and dispersibility of FeOX nanoparticles, and the optimal material could degrade 20 mg/L BPA completely in 5 min at 0.1 g/L in the presence of 1 g/L PDS. Free radical determination and quenching experiments indicated that both SO4•− and •OH were involved in BPA degradation. The degradation pathway was proposed based on the identification of degradation intermediates. The facile synthesis method, high activation efficiency, and low-cost and environmental friendly raw materials made the BAC/FeOX-50 an alternative catalyst for organic pollution water treatment. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Activation; Active free radicals; Biochar; Mixed valence FeOX; Peroxydisulfate","Activated carbon; Activated carbon treatment; Biomass; Carbonization; Chemical activation; Chlorine compounds; Crystallinity; Degradation; Efficiency; Free radicals; Iron oxides; Magnetite; Nanoparticles; Phenols; Scanning electron microscopy; Synthesis (chemical); Transmission electron microscopy; Water pollution; X ray photoelectron spectroscopy; Alternative catalysts; Calcination method; Degradation efficiency; Degradation intermediates; Degradation pathways; Environmental-friendly; High crystallinity; High-resolution TEM; Iron metallography; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; activated carbon; iron oxide nanoparticle; peroxydisulfate; sulfate; unclassified drug; 4,4' isopropylidenediphenol; benzhydryl derivative; charcoal; nanoparticle; phenol derivative; activated carbon; biomass; catalysis; catalyst; chemical compound; composite; degradation; detection method; inorganic compound; iron oxide; nanoparticle; organic pollutant; pollutant removal; water treatment; Article; biomass; carbonization; mineralization; nanocatalyst; one pot synthesis; organic pollution; pH; photodegradation; scanning electron microscopy; temperature; time; transmission electron microscopy; X ray diffraction; X ray photoemission spectroscopy; biomass; Benzhydryl Compounds; Biomass; Charcoal; Nanoparticles; Phenols",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098887278

Air pollution research is a complex system and one of the main methods is through numerical simulation. The air quality model is an important technical method, it allows researchers to better analyze air pollutants in different regions. In addition, the SCB is a high-humidity and foggy area, and the concentration of atmospheric pollutants is always high. However, research on this region, one of the four most polluted regions in China, is still lacking. Reviewing the application of air quality models in the SCB air pollution has not been reported thoroughly. To fill these gaps, this review provides a comprehensive narration about i) The status of air pollution in SCB; ii) The application of air quality models in SCB; iii) The problems and application prospects of air quality models in the research of air pollution.

Also, the relationship between the transformation efficiency of scientific and technological achievements in universities and the development of a low-carbon economy was quantitatively analyzed. The research results show that: (1) the transformation efficiency of scientific and technological achievements of universities in China is increasing year by year and which is significantly higher in the eastern region than that in the central and western regions. (2) The efficiency of the transformation of scientific and technological achievements of the university promotes the reduction of carbon emission intensity and the development of a low-carbon economy, indicating that the improvement of the transformation efficiency of scientific and technological achievements of the university has a good role in promoting the ecological environment protection. However, compared with the developed countries, the quantity and quality of science and technology supply and ecological environment protection in China's universities are still insufficient. In this regard, the development suggestions are put forward from the aspects of government policy guidance, professional talent cooperation and strengthening the docking between universities and industrial low-carbon economic development.

In the present study, three tillage modes were tested, including rice conventional cultivation with intensive till (CT), conventional flat cultivation with no-till (FNT) and ridge cultivation with no-till (RNT) in Dafasi town, Wuxue city, Hubei province, China. This study for the first time evaluates the effects of RNT on agricultural GHG emissions, grain yield, CF, energy budget and NEEE. Compared with CT and FNT, RNT reduced the soil CH4 emissions by 29.5% and 9.9%, respectively. CT resulted in 15.8% and 23.1% lower total GHG emissions than FNT and RNT, respectively, due to lower soil CH4 emissions. Moreover, RNT significant decreased the CF by 35.7% and 18.2% relative to CT and FNT, respectively. The net energy, energy efficiency and energy productivity under RNT were 41.2%, 25.0% and 26.7% higher than those under CT, respectively, while the specific energy under RNT was 24.7% lower than that under CT. The NEEE under RNT was 1.66 and 1.20 folds of that under CT and FNT, respectively. In conclusion, this study recommends that RNT is an environmentally safe tillage mode for reducing GHG emissions and CF, and improving energy use efficiency and NEEE for rice production in China and similar agro-eco-regions elsewhere in the world. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural input; Economic benefit; Energy budget; Greenhouse gas emissions; Tillage practice","Agricultural robots; Budget control; Carbon footprint; Cultivation; Ecosystems; Emission control; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Conventional cultivations; Economic efficiency; Energy productivity; Energy-use efficiency; Environmentally safe; Integrated assessment; Rice production; Specific energy; Greenhouse gases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101836421

Incineration is considered as an effective way to deal with the growing demand for MSW disposal. The prediction of concentrations of pollutants generated from MSW incineration plants is a powerful support for waste incineration process control, which aims to reduce pollutant emissions. This paper proposes a two-stage prediction method based on the long short-term memory (LSTM) network to forecast typical flue gas pollutants of an MSW incineration plant in South China. In the first stage, an LSTM-based classification model is utilized to determine whether the pollutants are at a low level, and over-sampling strategy is applied to deal with the class-imbalance problem. At the second stage, an LSTM-based prediction model is built to further estimate the amounts of pollutants. Besides, the sliding average method is used to process the multi-scale raw data. Experiment results proved the effectiveness of the proposed method and indicated how different inputs affect the forecasting of pollutant emissions. © 2021 IEEE.","deep learning; emission forecasting; LSTM; machine learning; municipal solid waste incineration","Air pollution; Flue gases; Forecasting; Interactive computer systems; Long short-term memory; Metropolitan area networks; Municipal solid waste; Population statistics; Predictive analytics; Class imbalance problems; Classification models; Incineration process; MSW incineration; Municipal solid waste (MSW); Pollutant emission; Prediction model; Rapid population growth; Waste incineration",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107776215

However, little is known about economic parameters and carbon footprint (CF, defined as total greenhouse gases emission from the whole life cycle perspective) of intensive wheat (Triticum aestivum L.)-maize (Zea mays L.) double cropping production under different integrated strategies of straw-return and tillage. To quantify the differences of straw-return and tillage integrated strategies in economic parameters and carbon sustainability, a field experiment was established in 2008 in which six integrated strategies were evaluated: straw return of both maize and wheat (MR-WR), MR-WR with subsoiling to ~40 cm depth after maize harvest (MS-WR), single straw return of wheat (MN-WR), single straw return of maize (MR-WN), MR-WN with subsoiling to ~40 cm depth after maize harvest (MS-WN) and no straw return (MN-WN). Results showed that the MS-WR had the greatest grain yields of both wheat and maize, gross revenue and economic profit with increases of 45.5%, 35.6%, 26.5%, and 79.7% relative to the MN-WN, respectively. Compared with the initial SOC level, the SOC stock increased by 22.9% under MS-WR, following by MR-WR (16.0%), MS-WN (11.6%), MR-WN (8.0%), MN-WR (5.1%), and MN-WN (−3.8%). The MS-WR reduced the net CF and net CF per economic profit by 35.4% and 64.1% relative to the MN-WN although it elevated the CF by 25.3%. Therefore, adopting the integrated strategies of both maize and wheat straw return with subsoiling to ~40 cm depth after maize harvest represented an economically and C-friendly optimal field management practice for intensive wheat-maize double cropping production in the Guanzhong Plain or other regions with similar environmental conditions in the world. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Economic profit; Net carbon footprint; SOC sequestration; Straw return; Wheat-maize system","Atmospheric chemistry; Carbon dioxide; Carbon footprint; Emission control; Greenhouse gases; Harvesting; Life cycle; Organic carbon; Profitability; Sustainable development; Atmospheric carbon dioxide; Economic parameters; Environmental conditions; Greenhouse gases emissions; Integrated strategy; Maize (Zea mays L.); Soil organic carbon; Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); Grain (agricultural product); carbon dioxide; magnesium; organic carbon; carbon; agricultural economics; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; integrated approach; maize; organic carbon; profitability; soil organic matter; straw; tillage; wheat; Article; carbon sequestration; China; crop; cropping system; economic aspect; environmental sustainability; geographic and geological phenomena; grain yield; Guanzhong Plain; maize; profit; tillage; Triticum aestivum; agriculture; carbon footprint; maize; soil; wheat; China; Guanzhong Plain; Shaanxi; Triticum aestivum; Zea mays; Agriculture; Carbon; Carbon Footprint; China; Soil; Triticum; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100384674

Unfortunately, limited ground-level observation data make it challenging to fully reflect the spatial pattern of NO3 levels across China. Until now, long-term monthly particulate NO3 datasets at a high resolution were still missing, which restricted the assessment of human health and ecosystem safety. Therefore, a unique monthly NO3 dataset at 0.25 resolution over China during 2005 2015 was developed by assimilating surface observations, satellite products, meteorological data, land use types and other covariates using an ensemble model combining random forest (RF), gradientboosting decision tree (GBDT), and extreme gradient-boosting (XGBoost) methods. The new developed product featured an excellent cross-validation R2 value (0.78) and relatively lower root-mean-square error (RMSE: 1.19 ugNm3) and mean absolute error (MAE: 0.81 ugNm3). Besides, the dataset also exhibited relatively robust performance at the spatial and temporal scales. Moreover, the dataset displayed good agreement with (R2 D 0:85, RMSE D 0:74 ugNm3, and MAE D 0:55 ugNm3) some unlearned data collected from previous studies. The spatiotemporal variations in the developed product were also shown. The estimated NO3 concentration showed the highest value in the North China Plain (NCP) (3:551:25 ugNm3); followed by the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) (2:561:12 ugNm3), Pearl River Delta (PRD) (1:680:81 ugNm3), and Sichuan Basin (1:530:63 ugNm3), and the lowest one in the Tibetan Plateau (0:420:25 ugNm3). The higher ambient NO3 concentrations in the NCP, YRD, and PRD were closely linked to the dense anthropogenic emissions. Apart from the intensive human activities, poor terrain condition might be a key factor for the serious NO3 pollution in the Sichuan Basin. The lowest ambient NO3 concentration in the Tibetan Plateau was contributed by the scarce anthropogenic emission and favourable meteorological factors (e.g. high wind speed). In addition, the ambient NO3 concentration showed a marked increasing tendency of 0.10 ugNm3 yr1 during 2005 2014 (p 0:05), while it decreased sharply from 2014 to 2015 at a rate of 0:40 ugNm3 yr1 (p 0:05). The ambient NO3 levels in Beijing Tianjin Hebei (BTH), YRD, and PRD displayed gradual increases at a rate of 0.20, 0.11, and 0.05 ugNm3 yr1 (p 0:05) during 2005 2013, respectively. The gradual increases in NO3 concentrations in these regions from 2005 to 2013 were due to the fact that the emission reduction measures during this period focused on the reduction of SO2 emission rather than NOx emission and the rapid increase in energy consumption. Afterwards, the government further strengthened these emission reduction measures and thus caused the dramatic decreases in NO3 concentrations in these regions from 2013 to 2015 (p 0:05). The long-term NO3 dataset over China could greatly deepen the knowledge about the impacts of emission reduction measures on air quality improvement.

In the past half century, rapid population growth and excessive use of wetland resources led to its lower functions, gradual wetland exploitation, and unreasonable development and usage. To implement river wetland landscape planning and design from low-carbon perspective, river compound functions compatible with urban functions are considered; landscape is taken as a green infrastructure, landscape infrastructure in construction, while cultural and experience design and ecological restoration and protection are taken as design points. In addition, systematic planning is used to optimize the overall layout, system planning, and engineering design in urban river wetland landscape planning and design and establish symbiosis development relationship between the river and the city, thereby effectively coordinating the relationship between ecology and economy and society and leisure activities. Meanwhile, low-carbon effect of river wetland landscape planning is evaluated through analytic hierarchy process-based low-carbon evaluation model of river wetland landscape planning. River wetland of the Yellow River National Wetland Park in Jinan is taken as an example for landscape planning and design. Analytic hierarchy process-based low-carbon evaluation model of river wetland landscape planning is used to evaluate five sampling points of the designed river wetland, revealing that the correlation coefficients (low carbon index) are respectively 0.6512, 0.6647, 0.6320, 0.6907, and 0.6292. Hence, wetland sampling site 4 has optimal low carbon level. Although there is still a certain gap from the low-carbon standard for tourist attractions formulated by the state, sampling point 4 has a correlation degree of 0.6907, which approaches 0.7. Low-carbon planning of river wetland landscape demands long-term implementation. Low-carbon index is expected to further grow in the future. © 2021, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Analytic hierarchy process; Landscape; Low-carbon perspective; Planning; River; Wetland",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105823947

Based on cotton phenology and meteorological data from 79 agricultural weather stations in China between 1981 and 2017, the Pearson correlation, multi-variate linear regression and path analysis are applied to investigate the spatial and temporal changes of cotton phenological indices and climate variables (precipitation (Pre), sunshine duration (Sun), average (Tave), minimum (Tmin) and maximum temperatures (Tmax), influence degrees of Pre, Sun, and Tave on phenology, and isolated effects of climate change and crop management on cotton phenology. The results showed that: (1) Emergence (Eme), squaring (Squ), flowering (Flo), and boll opening (Bol) dates of cotton advanced by 0.026–0.351 days year−1, respectively. The cotton sowing (Sow) and maturity (Mat) dates were delayed by 0.170 and 0.337 days year−1. The average phenological stages from Sow-Eme, Squ-Flo, and Flo-Bol were shortened about 0.19–0.30 days year−1, Eme-Squ, Bol-Mat and the Sow-Mat were delayed by 0.11, 0.77, and 0.082 days year−1, respectively. (2) Pre had a positive effect on most of the lengths phenological stages of cotton except during Bol-Mat. The effect of Sun on the length of the various phenological stages of cotton was the opposite of that of Pre. Tave, Tmin, and Tmax on the general negative effects on the length of the cotton phenological stages. (3) Pre, Sun, and Tave had different influence degrees on the cotton phenological stages because of different regional climate characteristics. (4) The impact of climate change on cotton phenology was weaker than crop management or combined effects of climate change and crop management. Under the combined impacts, and isolated impact of crop management, the lengths of the stages from Sow-Eme and Squ-Flo were shortened while other phenological stages were extended. The isolated impact of climate change shortened the lengths of stages from Sow-Eme, Eme-Squ, and Flo-Bol, extended Squ-Flo, Bol-Mat, and Sow-Mat, implying that the longer-duration cotton varieties in a changing climate might be a better choice for planting. This could be a viable strategy for adapting to climate change. In addition, the study found that Seed cotton yield (Scy) decreased with the delay of Sow, Eme, Squ, Flo and Bol dates, increased with the increase of the lengths of Sow-Eme, Flo-Bol, Bol-Mat and Sow-Mat. And the change trend of Scy affected by climate change was less than that affected by crop management or combined effects. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Climate change; Cotton phenology; Crop management; Seed cotton yield; Statistical analysis","Biology; Climate change; Correlation methods; Crops; Cultivation; Regression analysis; Change management; Combined effect; Cotton phenology; Cotton yield; Crop managements; Influence degree; Phenological stage; Planting areas; Seed cotton; Seed cotton yield; Cotton",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103425678

Many efforts have been devoted to boost the activity and selectivity of high-value multicarbon products (C2+) on Cu-based electrocatalysts. However, Cu-based CO2RR electrocatalysts suffer from poor catalytic stability mainly due to the structural degradation and loss of active species under CO2RR condition. To date, most reported Cu-based electrocatalysts present stabilities over dozens of hours, which limits the advance of Cu-based electrocatalysts for CO2RR. Herein, a porous chlorine-doped Cu electrocatalyst exhibits high C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 53.8 % at −1.00 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (VRHE). Importantly, the catalyst exhibited an outstanding catalytic stability in long-term electrocatalysis over 240 h. Experimental results show that the chlorine-induced stable cationic Cu0/Cu+ species and the well-preserved structure with abundant active sites are critical to the high FE of C2+ in the long-term run of electrochemical CO2 reduction. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","chlorine; CO2 reduction reaction; copper; electrocatalysis; mixed oxidation states","Carbon dioxide; Catalyst activity; Chlorine; Copper; Electrocatalysis; Electrocatalysts; Electrolysis; Active species; Catalytic stability; Faradaic efficiencies; Porous coppers; Reduction reaction; Residual chlorines; Reversible hydrogen electrodes; Structural degradation; Reduction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104043681

However, we lack integrated and quantitative observations of the occurrence of ARGs in the UWS to characterize the sources and identify processes that contribute to their fate. We sampled the UWSs from three medium-size cities in Denmark, Spain, and the United Kingdom and quantified 70 clinically important extended-spectrum β-lactamase and carbapenemase genes along with the mobile genetic elements and microbial communities. Results from all three countries showed that sewage - especially from hospitals - carried substantial loads of ARGs (106-107 copies per person equivalent), but these loads progressively declined along sewers and through sewage treatment plants, resulting in minimal emissions (101-104 copies per person equivalent). Removal was primarily during sewage conveyance (65 ± 36%) rather than within sewage treatment (34 ± 23%). The extended-spectrum β-lactamase and carbapenemase genes were clustered in groups based on their persistence in the UWS compartments. The less-persistent groups were associated to putative host taxa (especially Enterobacteriaceae and Moraxellaceae), while the more persistent groups appeared horizontally transferred and correlated significantly with total cell numbers and mobile genetic elements. This documentation of a substantial ARG reduction during sewage conveyance provides opportunities for antibiotic resistance management and a caution for sewage-based antibiotic resistance surveillance. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

Yet, little is known about the roles of urine, dung and their mixtures in regulating the plant and soil carbon:nitrogen:phosphorus (C:N:P) stoichiometry and their interactions. Methods: We explored how different excrement types (urine, dung and their mixtures) and supply levels [urine: 0.5, 1.0 and 1.5 L m−2; dung: 4.7, 9.4 and 14.2 g m−2; mixtures (urine+dung): 0.5 + 4.7, 1.0 + 9.4 and 1.5 + 14.2] altered the plant and soil C:N:P stoichiometry in a semi-arid grassland on the Loess Plateau. Results: We found that the aboveground biomass of the whole community was highest at the highest mixtures application rate, while the highest aboveground biomass of the three dominant species was detected at applications of 0.5 L m−2 urine for Stipa bungeana, 9.4 g m−2 dung for Lespedeza davurica and 1.0 L m−2 urine +9.4 g m−2 dung for Artemisia capillaris. Urine and dung alone increased plant N concentration, which peaked at 1.0 L m−2 urine. Plant P concentration at 1.5 + 14.2 mixtures was significantly higher than that at control without significant difference between excrement types. Compared to the control, excrement deposition did not significantly change plant C concentration and C:N, C:P and N:P ratios. However, plant C:P and N:P ratios under the mixtures were significantly lower than those under urine or dung. Excrement applications led to more soil (total, microbial and organic) C, N and P accumulations. Compared to urine and dung, the mixtures induced higher total P concentration but lower total N concentration in soil. Conclusions: Our study demonstrated that the impacts of sheep urine and dung on plant and soil C and nutrient concentrations and stoichiometry differed from that of mixtures. The plant N:P ratio indicated balanced N:P supply for urine and dung applications but N limitation for mixtures application. This study provides experimental evidence that the excrement of herbivores plays an important role in altering ecological stoichiometry in plants and soil. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.","Dung; Ecological stoichiometry; Nutrient cycling; Stocking rate; Urine","aboveground biomass; herbivore; manure; nutrient cycling; sheep; stoichiometry; terrestrial ecosystem; urine; China; Loess Plateau; Artemisia capillaris; Lespedeza daurica; Stipa bungeana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100957455

Microbial C use efficiency (CUE) describes the proportion of C used for growth relative to the total organic C uptake. As such, high CUE values mean relatively less CO2 emission and more C retention in microbial biomass. Similarly, a higher microbial N use efficiency (NUE) indicates efficient biomass N sequestration and less N mineralization. However, very little is known how the microbial CUE and NUE are affected by N enrichment in forest soils. Here, we studied soil microbial CUE and NUE simultaneously using 18O-water tracer approach in a long-term N addition experiment comprising control (atmospheric N deposition, 2.7 g N m−2 yr−1), low N addition (atmospheric N deposition + 2.5 g N m−2 yr−1) and high N addition (atmospheric N deposition + 7.5 g N m−2 yr−1) in a temperate forest. We found microbial CUE responses to N addition were dependent on N addition rates and soil horizons. Specifically, low N addition significantly increased the microbial CUE by 45.12% while high N addition significantly reduced it by 27.84% in organic soil. Further, mineral soil microbial CUE did not change under low N addition but significantly increased by 133.18% under high N addition. We also found microbial NUE decreased with increasing N addition rate in organic soil but showed an opposite pattern in mineral soil. The stoichiometric imbalances associated with phosphorus between microbial biomass and resources and the microbial community changes under N addition were correlated with microbial CUE and NUE. Further, N addition decreased microbial biomass turnover in organic soil but accelerated it in mineral soil. Altogether, our results indicated that N addition could control soil C and N cycling processes by affecting microbial elements use efficiencies (i.e. CUE and NUE), which may consequently impact C and N sequestration in this temperate forest soil. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Global N deposition; Microbial carbon use efficiency; Microbial community; Nitrogen use efficiency; Stoichiometry","Biomass; Deposition; Forestry; Microorganisms; Mineralogy; Minerals; Nitrogen; Soils; Stoichiometry; Global N deposition; Microbial biomass; Microbial C; Microbial carbon use efficiency; Microbial communities; N use efficiency; N-deposition; Nitrogen-use efficiency; Organic soil; Use efficiency; Efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102318695

Localized corrosion along the grain boundaries in a crystal film is common, but few preventive measures have been developed so far. Thus, we propose a novel strategy using a tantalum (Ta) and carbon (C) co-modification to improve the chemical stability of titanium carbide (TiC)-based coatings (Cr/Ta/TiC/C). During the film growth, the subjacent Ta atoms were thermally diffused throughout the columnar structure of TiC and reacted with the C layer. The reaction product, i.e., TaC, acted as a chemical passivator to the grain boundary. Combined with the C capping layer, these functional layers synergistically suppressed any localized corrosion. Therefore, corrosion current densities within the United States Department of Energy’s technical recommendations were achieved in both potentiostatic and potentiodynamic polarization. Meanwhile, by controlling the Ta metal dispersion, the interfacial contact resistance between the multilayer structure and the carbon paper can be reduced to 7.1 mΩ·cm−2 at a compaction force of 140 N·cm−2. The substantial improvement in the corrosion resistance and conductivity of BPP places our work among the most efficient anticorrosion systems in PEMFC applications reported so far. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.",,"Carbon; Chemical modification; Chemical stability; Corrosion resistance; Crystal atomic structure; Film growth; Grain boundaries; Localized corrosion; Multilayers; Passivation; Plates (structural components); Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Stainless steel; Steel corrosion; Surface resistance; Tantalum; Textures; Titanium carbide; Anti-corrosion systems; Corrosion current densities; Enhancing corrosion resistances; Interfacial contact resistance; Proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFCs); Stainless steel bipolar plates; Titanium carbides (TiC); United states department of energies; Corrosion resistant coatings",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098600606

Based on the data on Chinese industrial firms and customs during 2010 and 2013, this paper analyzes the effect of ECER policy on employment adjustment with a difference-in-difference (DID) model and a mediating effect model. The results indicate that ECER policy significantly promotes net job growth by increasing firms’ job creation effect and weakening the job destruction effect. For every 1% increase in ECER policy intensity, net job growth increases by 8.04%. The heterogeneity analysis shows that ECER policy weakens net job growth at firms with high export intensity, high market concentration, and high pollution and increases net job growth at firms in regions that are highly market based. ECER policy promotes job growth through the mediating mechanism of the productivity effect and adjustment in the scope of exports. Our results are helpful for assessing the shock to employment from Chinese environmental policy and provides feasible policy suggestions for adjusting existing laws and regulations to achieve higher social welfare. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Employment adjustment; Energy conservation and emissions reduction; Export scope adjustment; job creation; job destruction","Commerce; Employment; Energy conservation; Environmental regulations; Action plan; Emission reduction policies; Employment adjustment; Energy conservation and emission reductions; Export scope adjustment; Job creation; Job destruction; Manufacturing firms; Microdata; Save energy; Emission control",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102640491

Climate change is a major driver affecting the dynamics of SOC; however, our understanding about the responses of SOC in alpine ecosystems to climate change is quite limited. In particular, the differences of SOC dynamics at different depths were rarely reported. In this study, we investigated the impacts of precipitation variations and warming on SOC dynamics at both top and deep soils in the Qilian Mountains in Northwestern China using a machine learning approach and climate sensitivity experiments. Our simulation revealed the temporal inconsistency between topsoil SOC (in the top 20 cm, denoted as SOC20) and deeper soil SOC dynamics—SOC20 showed a decreasing trend since 2009 which is earlier than that (2012) in the top 100 cm soil (SOC100). We also found that SOC100 may be more sensitive to warming due to the strengthened microbial decomposition rate and additional carbon source through deepened active layer. On the contrary, SOC20 presented more intense responses to precipitation than SOC100, which was mainly attributed to the different responses of upland and lowland SOC to precipitation variations. Our projection indicated that SOC20 may not substantially change under future climate trajectories because the enriched SOC induced by increased precipitation may offset the carbon loss via warming. However, SOC100 was projected to decrease significantly due to the enhanced carbon emissions via warming induced strengthened decomposition rate, additional carbon source from the deepened active layer, and exposed soil carbon to the atmosphere caused by ground subsidence and disrupted soil horizons resulting from thawed frozen soil. In brief, this study deepened our understanding of the mechanism of climate effect on SOC dynamics and can be helpful for regional soil ecological security assessment and risk projection. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon cycle; Climate change; Projection; Random forest; Sensitivity analysis","Decision trees; Dynamics; Ecology; Frozen soils; Landforms; Organic carbon; Risk assessment; Sensitivity analysis; Carbon cycles; Carbon dynamics; Carbon source; Decomposition rate; Deep soils; Precipitation variation; Projection; Qilian mountains; Random forests; Soil organic carbon; Climate change; carbon cycle; climate change; ecosystem approach; machine learning; risk assessment; simulation; soil carbon; soil organic matter; topsoil; warming; China; Qilian Mountains",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102086553

We used automated and manual chambers to compare N2O emissions throughout a two-year legume-wheat field experiment. Two pulse crops [lupin (Lupinus angustifolius L.) and field pea (Pisum sativum L.)] and two forage legumes [vetch (Vicia sativa L.) and clover (a mixture of four Trifolium spp.)] were grown in the first year, followed by a wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) crop in the second year without additional nitrogen (N) fertilizer under either no-till or tillage systems. All legume crops were either (a) chemically terminated at anthesis (brown-manured, BM), or (b) cut for hay (forage legumes) or harvested for grain (pulses) (product-removed, PR). The fate of legume N in the BM treatment was traced using 15N labelled urea applied to soil in micro-plots. Results showed that N2O emissions during the legume and wheat phases were mostly unaffected by legume species, the exception being lower emissions from the BM clover pasture under the no-till treatment. Under the PR treatment, tillage tended to increase N2O emissions compared with the no-till treatment during both legume (121 vs. 104 g N2O-N ha−1 year−1) and wheat phases (91 vs. 79 g N2O-N ha−1 year−1). In contrast, a mixed result was found under the BM treatment with a significant tillage × crop management interaction during the legume phase, but no effect of tillage during the wheat phase. In general, the BM treatment promoted more N2O emissions due to more N input into soil compared to the PR treatment, with the impact extending into the subsequent wheat crop. The N2O emissions from the BM treatment during the legume (195 g N2O-N ha−1 year−1) and wheat phase (181 g N2O-N ha−1 year−1) were greater than those from the PR treatment for the corresponding phases (113 vs. 85 g N2O-N ha−1 year−1). The 15N study showed that the majority of legume-derived N was retained in the soil at the end of the legume phase and likely to be readily available for the subsequent cereal crop. The mitigation of N2O emissions derived from legumes in a semi-arid cereal-based cropping system can be optimized in a no-till system where product removal is practiced (cut for hay or harvested for grain) with legume species choice having little or no additional impact. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Crop production; Greenhouse gas; Nitrogen mineralization; Nitrogen recovery; Pulse crop","Agricultural wastes; Cereal products; Crops; Grain (agricultural product); Nitrogen fertilizers; Nitrogen oxides; Plants (botany); Soils; Urea; Crop managements; Crop residue management; Cropping systems; Lower emissions; Lupinus angustifolius; Nitrous oxide emissions; Semi-arid environments; Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.); Soil pollution; crop residue; crop rotation; cropping practice; experimental study; legume; nitrous oxide; semiarid region; soil emission; wheat; zero tillage; Australia; Fabaceae; Lupinus angustifolius; Pisum sativum; Trifolium; Triticum aestivum; Vicia sativa",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099880577

Surface soils (0-20 cm depth) were collected from 15 agricultural fields, including two sites with different carbon input strategies, in Zhejiang Province, China, and water-dispersible nanocolloids (0.6-25 nm), fine colloids (25-160 nm), and medium colloids (160-500 nm) were separated and analyzed using the asymmetrical flow field flow fractionation technique. Three levels of fine-colloidal P content (3583-6142, 859-2612, and 514-653 μg kg-1) were identified at the regional scale. The nanocolloidal fraction correlated with organic carbon (Corg) and calcium (Ca), and the fine colloidal fraction with Corg, silicon (Si), aluminum (Al), and iron (Fe). Significant linear relationships existed between colloidal P and Corg, Si, Al, Fe, and Ca and for nanocolloidal P with Ca. The organic carbon controlled colloidal P saturation, which in turn affected the P carrier ability of colloids. Field-scale organic carbon inputs did not change the overall morphological trends in size fractions of water-dispersible colloids. However, they significantly affected the peak concentration in each of the nano-, fine-, and medium-colloidal P fractions. Application of chemical fertilizer with carbon-based solid manure and/or modified biochar reduced the soil nano-, fine-, and medium-colloidal P content by 30-40%; however,the application of chemical fertilizer with biogas slurry boosted colloidal P formation. This study provides a deep and novel understanding of the forms and composition of colloidal P in agricultural soils and highlights their spatial regulation by soil characteristics and carbon inputs. © 2021 American Chemical Society.

This paper uses the annual data of 30 provinces in China from 2000 to 2017, and constructs a dynamic spatial Durbin model and a geographically weighted regression model to empirically test the dynamic impact of hydropower on haze pollution and economic growth at the national and provincial levels. The empirical results show that the promoting effect of hydropower on economic growth in Western China is less than that in Eastern China, which further aggravates the economic development gap between the eastern and western regions. In addition, the suppression effect of hydropower on the haze pollution in the western region is greater than that in the eastern region, where the haze pollution is serious. From the national level, hydropower can promote regional economic growth and inhibit haze pollution, and the spatial spillover effects of these two effects are greater than the local effects, and the long-term impact is greater than the short-term impact.

The effectiveness of building energy codes on energy savings and emission mitigation is of a primary concern to policy makers, but uncertainty in cost and benefit in different regions complicates code selection and implementation. The impacts of a specific building energy standard vary depending on the heating system's thermal efficiency and the heating fuel's carbon intensity. This paper examines the GHG emissions due to space heating for new construction single-detached households in Canada under different building energy codes and enforcement scenarios. The two codes considered are the BC step code and Passive House criteria. Three scenarios are examined reflecting different levels of stringency of standards between 2020 and 2032. The results show both BC step code and passive house criteria can help mitigate the space heating GHG emissions. There is no significant difference between the BC step code and the passive house criteria from the perspective of GHG emission reduction in the province of British Columbia; however, when implemented nationwide, the passive house criteria is 12% more effective in abating space heating GHG emissions than the most stringent level (i.e. Step 5) of BC step code. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","BC Energy step code; Carbon intensity; GHG emission; Space heating energy","Codes (symbols); Emission control; Energy conservation; Greenhouse gases; Space heating; BC energy step code; Building energy code; Carbon intensity; Emission reduction; Emissions mitigation; Energy code; GHG emission; GHGs emissions; Passive house; Space heating energy; Houses",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103788693

Air Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan for Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and Surrounding Areas was issued to solve the problem of scattered coal consumption and improve the heating energy structure in 2017. In this paper, an air quality-heating model is established to evaluate the air quality improvement potential and far-reaching influence of scattered coal consumption reduction in rural areas. Distinct from other air quality evaluation models, the proposed model is to evaluate the regional air quality related to the heating factors. The results indicate that the coal substitution policy can reduce PM2.5 concentrations in the heating season by about 20 μg/m3 in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and surrounding areas. Furthermore, predictions about the variation of PM2.5 concentration in the heating season are conducted, which indicate that the PM2.5 concentration of Beijing, Tianjin, Hebei and surrounding areas in 2030 will drop by 48%, 35%, 29% and 23% respectively compared to that in 2016. The reduction could be further enhanced to be 55%, 40%, 32% and 27% with the consideration of clean power development.

Massive quantities of base metals and mineral materials (for example, silica and concrete) along with smaller quantities of precious metals will be required for the construction of wind turbines, solar panels and battery storage facilities to meet the demands of the ‘Electric Planet’ of the future. Harnessing microbe-mineral-metal interactions may offer many opportunities to improve some mining practises and support the long-term sustainability of mining. As easily exploitable, high-grade deposits are becoming increasingly depleted there is a need for new technologies to improve exploration and mining strategies. Microorganisms are ubiquitous and diverse, surviving in almost all environments in the Earth's crust and recent advances in molecular techniques have enabled scientists to study these communities is extraordinary detail. Microorganisms also interact directly with their environment; both responding to and changing the environment around them. These responses and their influences on the surrounding environment are preserved within their genome (a complete set of the DNA of the microorganism). Here, we discuss using state-of-the-art sequencing techniques to identify key microbial genes that have been demonstrated to correlate with metal concentrations. These genetic-based bioindicators may provide additional tools to guide and improve the success rate of mineral exploration programmes. Advances in molecular techniques will also improve existing biohydrometallurgical techniques and expand the commodity range for which biohydrometallurgy are currently economically viable. Finally, microorganisms may be used in a number of strategies for mine remediation; specifically, we review in detail microbially accelerated carbon capture and storage strategies and mine waste stabilisation. © 2021 The Author(s)","Biohydrometallurgy; Bioindicators; Bioleaching; Bioremediation; Microbe-mineral interactions; Mining","bioindicator; bioremediation; concentration (composition); innovation; leaching; metallurgy; mineral exploration; mining",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102612409

Existing research suggests that climate information is more likely to lead to adaptation actions when it is coproduced by researchers and policy makers because doing so increases the likelihood that the content of information is credible, salient, and legitimate. In this study, we explored how the coproduction process facilitated or hindered use of information from two climate adaptation projects in coastal New Hampshire. Based on 17 interviews and document review, we found that, contrary to expectations, highly engaged coproduction of knowledge may not be necessary due, in part, to preexisting trust among New Hampshire coastal municipalities, technical service providers, and researchers. However, we found in small towns with limited capacity, even the best climate knowledge is unlikely to be used without ongoing context-specific implementation assistance. Our research provides both practical recommendations for those actively advancing climate adaptation, as well as contributions to the undertheorized third phase of transdisciplinary research in which knowledge is translated to action. © 2021 The Author(s).

The forests have regrown since farm abandonment, representing what is arguably the most successful regional reforestation on record and identified recently in the “Global Safety Net.” Temperate “old-growth” forest and remnant stands demonstrate that native tree species can live several hundred years and continue to add to forest biomass and structural and ecological complexity. Forests globally are an essential natural climate solution that accumulate carbon and reduce annual increases in atmospheric CO2 by approximately 30%. Some studies emphasize young, fast-growing trees and forests while others highlight carbon storage and accumulation in old trees and intact forests. We addressed this directly within New England with long-term, accurate field measurements and volume modeling of individual trees and two stands of eastern white pines (Pinaceae: Pinus strobus) and compared our results to models developed by the U.S. Forest Service. Within this sample and species, our major findings complement and clarify previous findings and are threefold: (1) beyond 80 years, an intact eastern white pine forest can accumulate carbon above-ground in living trees at a high rate and double the carbon stored in this compartment in subsequent years; (2) large trees dominate above-ground carbon and can continue to accumulate carbon; (3) productive stands can continue to accumulate high amounts of carbon in live trees for well over 150 years. Because the next decades are critical in addressing the climate emergency, and most New England forests are less than 100 years old, a major implication of this work is that maintaining and accumulating carbon in some existing forests—proforestation—is a powerful regional climate solution. Furthermore, older and old-growth trees and forests are rare, complex, highly dynamic and biodiverse: dedication of some forests to proforestation will produce large carbon-dense trees and also protect ecosystem integrity, special habitats, and native biodiversity long-term. In sum, strategic policies to grow and protect suitable existing forests in New England will optimize a proven, low cost, natural climate solution that also protects and restores biodiversity across the landscape. © Copyright © 2021 Leverett, Masino and Moomaw.","carbon accumulation; chronoseqeuence; ecological integrity; ecological resilience; intact forest; old-growth and second-growth forest; proforestation; tree volume",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106202285

However, these were derived for industrialized livestock farms and do not represent conditions of smallholder farms (small, low-producing livestock breeds, poor feed quality, feed scarcity). Here, we present the first measurements of CH4 and N2O emissions from cattle-manure heaps representing feeding practices typical for smallholder farms in the highlands of East Africa: 1) cattle fed below maintenance energy requirements to represent feed scarcity, and 2) cattle fed tropical forage grasses (Napier, Rhodes, Brachiaria). Sub-maintenance feeding reduced cumulative manure N2O emissions compared to cattle receiving sufficient feed but did not change EFN2O. Sub-maintenance feeding did not affect cumulative manure CH4 emissions or EFCH4. When cattle were fed tropical forage grasses, cumulative manure N2O emissions did not differ between diets, but manure EFN2O from Brachiaria and Rhodes diets were lower than the IPCC EFN2O for solid storage (1%, 2019 Refinement of IPCC Guidelines). Manure CH4 emissions were lower in the Rhodes grass diet than when feeding Napier or Brachiaria, and manure EFCH4 from all three grasses were lower than the IPCC default (4.4 g CH4 kg−1 VS, 2019 Refinement of IPCC Guidelines). Regression analysis revealed that manure N concentration and C:N were important drivers of N2O emissions, with low N concentrations and high C:N reducing N2O emissions. Our results show that IPCC EFs overestimate excreta GHG emissions, which calls for additional measurements to develop localized EFs for smallholder livestock systems in SSA. © 2021 The Author(s)","Brachiaria; Greenhouse gases; Napier; Rhodes; Solid storage; Sub-Saharan Africa","Agriculture; Feeding; Fertilizers; Maintenance; Manures; Regression analysis; Tropics; Brachiaria; Cattle manures; CH$-4$; Emission factors; Greenhouses gas; N$-2$/O; Napi; Rhode; Solid storage; Sub-saharan africa; Greenhouse gases; cattle; foraging behavior; grass; greenhouse gas; manure; methane; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; smallholder; agricultural land; animal experiment; article; Brachiaria; cattle manure; controlled study; diet; feeding; forage; grass; greenhouse gas; Kenya; livestock; nonhuman; practice guideline; animal; bovine; Kenya; manure; plant breeding; Kenya; Brachiaria; Chloris gayana; Poaceae; methane; nitrous oxide; Animals; Cattle; Kenya; Manure; Methane; Nitrous Oxide; Plant Breeding",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103128364

Utilizing recently abandoned cropland for renewable energy production is a promising option for energy supply while reducing competition for land and food security. However, the magnitude of abandoned cropland and its potential for renewable energy production is still unclear. Here, we mapped recently abandoned croplands at a global level and assessed the site-specific primary energy potentials for bioenergy and solar photovoltaics considering local climatic conditions, energy yields, and socio-economic feasibility constraints to identify optimal land use for renewable energy production. Of the 83 Mha of the identified abandoned cropland between 1992 and 2015, 68% of the area presented higher development potentials for the establishment of solar photovoltaic compared to dedicated bioenergy crops. In total, 125 EJ/year of primary energy can be produced with this optimal land management, of which 114 EJ/year is from solar photovoltaic and 11 EJ/year is from bioenergy. This figure corresponds to 33–50% of the projected median renewable energy demand in 2050 across the 1.5 °C stabilization scenarios. Mapping the suitability of renewable energy sources across different local, environmental, and socio-economic constraints will help identify the best implementation options for future energy systems transformation. © 2020 The Authors","Abandoned cropland; Bioenergy; Land use; Renewable energy; Solar energy","Biofuels; Climate change; Crops; Economics; Food supply; Land use; Solar power plants; Abandoned croplands; Climate change mitigation; Climatic conditions; Development potential; Large-scale deployment; Optimal combination; Renewable energy source; Solar photovoltaics; Solar energy; abandoned land; agricultural land; bioenergy; climate conditions; electricity supply; energy resource; nonrenewable resource; photovoltaic system; solar power",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097740032

For this purpose, the construction of a new and more dynamic electricity distribution network is mandatory. This “smart grid” should also include small and medium-size companies, able to program the generation and use of energy from renewable sources (the so-called ""prosumers""). In this frame, micro-cogeneration (rated electric power up to 50 kW) is one of the most promising techniques. In this work, the application to micro-cogeneration of an innovative Compression Ignition internal combustion engine, operated in Dual Fuel mode is proposed. Thanks to the specific combustion system (Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition, RCCI: a lean homogenous mixture of air and biomethane or biogas is ignited by the injection of a small amount of Diesel fuel), brake thermal efficiency can be increased at all operating conditions, compared to a conventional Spark Ignition engine running on biomethane or biogas. The ensuing reduction of CO2 emissions is higher than 20%. Furthermore, the proposed engine can tolerate larger variations in the composition of the biogas, without a significant drop of thermal efficiency. Finally, in case of emergency, it is able to run on Diesel fuel only. The use of the engine is particularly suitable for a company operating in the agricultural field, such as a mid-size farm, that is able to produce biogas for its self-consumption. Therefore, a representative study case is selected, and the corresponding electrical and thermal energy needs are analysed throughout a typical year.

Power to gas (PtG) technologies, especially Power to methane has been deemed as one of the promising pathways for the conversion of CO2 into valuable gaseous fuel. Many reports have reviewed the academic literature related to CO2 methanation. While the benefits of high temperature methanation for overall process efficiency are well understood, the potential for low-temperature methanation is less understood. In particular the opportunities that arise from coupling a low-temperature methanation process with low temperature hydrogen production technologies, such as PEM electrolysis, have received little attention. It is therefore considered valuable to provide a critical review of the state of the art of this technology at low temperature conditions for the interests of broader research community. In this paper we focus on the recent work around low temperature CO2 methanation including reaction thermodynamics and kinetics, catalyst materials including supports and promoters, and suitable reactor technologies. We discuss each of these critical aspects of the technology and identify key challenges and opportunities for low temperature CO2 methanation (methanation conducted at temperatures less than 300 °C). As part of this paper, we also present the results of an ASPEN Plus simulation study based on data available from the literature to highlight the potential energy efficiency gains of a low temperature methanation process. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Carbon supported catalysts; CCUS; CO2 emission; CO2 hydrogenation; CO2 utilisation; Methanation; Methanation catalysts; Structured catalysts; Techno-economic assessment","Carbon dioxide; Catalyst supports; Computer software; Energy efficiency; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen production; Hydrogenation; Low temperature production; Methanation; Potential energy; Reaction kinetics; Carbon supported catalyst; CCUS; CO2 emissions; CO2 hydrogenation; CO2 utilisation; Structured catalyst; Techno-economic assessment; Temperature",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85081572698

Bi/TiO2 shows positive characterization through anatase crystallinity, large light utilization rate, high specific surface area and low electron holes pair recombination rate as a result of the novel materials synthesis approach. Glycerol as a typical pollutant of industrial wastewater, is used here to demonstrate the concurrent production of chean water and H2 over the well synthesized Bi/TiO2. Bi is incorporated to extend the light absorbance capability of TiO2 to visible light region. Experimental data shows that 3% Bi/TiO2 exhibits the highest H2 generation and Total Organic Carbon (TOC) removal. The reduction of TOC of 8% means the conversion of glycerol into H2 has been achieved, which is in favor of the production of clean water from highly polluted glycerol wastewater. An optimization study is undertaken by varying the calcination temperature to investigate properties-activity relationship of the new photocatalyst, which exhibited higher photocatlytic efficiency under both UV–visible and visible light compared with that of bare TiO2. The mechanism illustration is derived from the novel materials synthesis and property optimization to explain the rationale behind this interesting phenomenon.

To examine the effect of the CO2 reduction policies, a forecasting model that considers the relationship between variables such as population, building area, industries, vehicle use, and the environment is required. Moreover, this model should also be applicable to various cities to support effective policymaking. In this study, we develop a model that can predict CO2 emissions from the relationship between the variables using System Dynamics, a method to model cities to represent one system composed of various variables. To expand the applicability of the model to various cities in Japan, the proposed model assigns statistical data as input data that can be obtained in any city and standardizes the system structure and variables of the model. In this study, we selected three cities, namely Fukuoka, Kashiwa, and Kumano, which had different populations and industrial characteristics. The calculation accuracy error of CO2 emissions for the three cities was found to be less than 6%. In addition, through the parameter study, it was confirmed that the proposed model can be used to examine the sectors that require CO2 reduction policies, along with the optimal application period. This study aims to provide an effective model that can help in CO2 forecasting and thus in environmental and sustainable development policymaking.

Real driving emission (RDE) tests were conducted using vehicles equipped with portable emissions measurement systems. Urban, rural, and motorway test routes were utilized. Road environment, atmospheric, and after‐treatment performance factors were collected in each case. An artificial neural network was used for evaluation using RDE test data and various statistical parameters. It was found that the proposed method pre-dicted the pollutant emissions effectively.

With respect to dermatology, vehicle emissions by patients traveling to and from appointments are an important factor influencing climate change. This study was undertaken to determine the greenhouse gas emissions avoided by managing isotretinoin virtually at West Virginia University Hospital. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted during the COVID-19 outbreak from March 25 to December 1, 2020, where travel data were acquired and converted to emission data. Results: 5,137 kg of GHG emissions in CO2 equivalents were prevented by managing isotretinoin virtually during the study period. 49 400 kg of GHG emissions in CO2 equivalents would be prevented annually. This is the emission load released when 24 690 kg of coal are burned. Conclusions: Environmental impact studies in the field of dermatology remain limited. GHG emissions were significantly reduced by virtually managing isotretinoin at a single institution. The practice of dermatology could reduce its carbon footprint by managing isotretinoin virtually, even in non-pandemic periods. Given that isotretinoin management represents a small percentage of the overall carbon footprint associated with dermatology, dermatologists should identify other conditions amenable to virtual medicine to produce greater environmental impact. © 2021 Wiley Periodicals LLC.","carbon footprint; isotretinoin; virtual medicine","carbon dioxide; fluorinated hydrocarbon; isotretinoin; methane; nitrous oxide; isotretinoin; air pollution; Article; carbon footprint; clinical practice; cross-sectional study; data collection method; dermatology; environmental impact; environmental release; exhaust gas; female; human; major clinical study; retrospective study; telemedicine; travel; United States; university hospital; virtual medicine; virtual reality; carbon footprint; greenhouse effect; Carbon Footprint; COVID-19; Cross-Sectional Studies; Greenhouse Effect; Humans; Isotretinoin; Retrospective Studies; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104415641

Yet, this depends largely on balance between soil C sequestration and the emissions of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N2O). Organic fertilizers strongly influence the microbial processes leading to the release of N2O. The mag-nitude and pattern of N2O emissions are different from the emissions observed from inorganic fertilizers and difficult to predict, which hinders developing best management practices specific to organic fertilizers. Currently, we lack a comprehensive evaluation of the effects of OFs on the function and structure of the N cycling microbial communities. Focusing on animal manures, here we provide an overview of the effects of these organic fertilizers on the community structure and function of nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms in upland soils. Unprocessed manure with high moisture, high available nitrogen (N) and C content can shift the structure of the microbial commu-nity, increasing the abundance and activity of nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms. Pro-cessed manure, such as digestate, compost, vermicompost and biochar, can also stimulate nitrifying and denitrifying microorganisms, although the effects on the soil microbial community structure are different, and N2O emissions are comparatively lower than raw manure. We propose a frame-work of best management practices to minimize the negative environmental impacts of organic fertilizers and maximize their benefits in improving soil health and sustaining food production sys-tems. Long-term application of composted manure and the buildup of soil C stocks may contribute to N retention as microbial or stabilized organic N in the soil while increasing the abundance of denitrifying microorganisms and thus reduce the emissions of N2O by favoring the completion of denitrification to produce dinitrogen gas. Future research using multi-omics approaches can be used to establish key biochemical pathways and microbial taxa responsible for N2O production under organic fertilization. © 2021 by the authors.

Instruments on geostationary satellites provide suitable observations allowing long-term monitoring of surface albedo from space. In 2012, EUMETSAT published Release 1 of the Meteosat Surface Albedo (MSA) data record. The main limitation effecting the quality of this release was non-removed clouds by the incorporated cloud screening procedure that caused too high albedo values, in particular for regions with permanent cloud coverage. For the generation of Release 2, the MSA algorithm has been replaced with the Geostationary Surface Albedo (GSA) one, able to process imagery from any geostationary imager. The GSA algorithm exploits a new, improved, cloud mask allowing better cloud screening, and thus fixing the major limitation of Release 1. Furthermore, the data record has an extended temporal and spatial coverage compared to the previous release. Both Black-Sky Albedo (BSA) and White-Sky Albedo (WSA) are estimated, together with their associated uncertainties. A direct comparison between Release 1 and Release 2 clearly shows that the quality of the retrieval improved significantly with the new cloud mask. For Release 2 the decadal trend is less than 1% over stable desert sites. The validation against Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the Southern African Regional Science Initiative (SAFARI) surface albedo shows a good agreement for bright desert sites and a slightly worse agreement for urban and rain forest locations.

In this study, a laboratory 15N tracing experiment was carried out at 60% WHC (water holding capacity) and 25°C to evaluate the gross N transformation rates and N2O emission pathways in sandy loam and silt loam soils in a semiarid region of Heilongjiang Province, China. The results showed that the gross rates of N mineralization, immobilization, and nitrification were 3.60, 1.90, and 5.63 mg N/(kg·d) in silt loam soil, respectively, which were 3.62, 4.26, and 3.13 times those in sandy loam soil, respectively. The ratios of the gross nitrification rate to the ammonium immobilization rate (n/ia) in sandy loam soil and silt loam soil were all higher than 1.00, whereas the n/ia in sandy loam soil (4.36) was significantly higher than that in silt loam soil (3.08). This result indicated that the ability of sandy loam soil to release and conserve the available N was relatively poor in comparison with silt loam soil, and the relatively strong nitrification rate compared to the immobilization rate may lead to N loss through NO3− leaching. Under aerobic conditions, both nitrification and denitrification made contributions to N2O emissions. Nitrification was the dominant pathway leading to N2O production in soils and was responsible for 82.0% of the total emitted N2O in sandy loam soil, which was significantly higher than that in silt loam soil (71.7%). However, the average contribution of denitrification to total N2O production in sandy loam soil was 17.9%, which was significantly lower than that in silt loam soil (28.3%). These results are valuable for developing reasonable fertilization management and proposing effective greenhouse gas mitigation strategies in different soil types in semiarid regions. © 2021, Xinjiang Institute of Ecology and Geography, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Science Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","15N tracing; gross N transformation rates; N2O emission sources; sandy loam; semiarid region; silt loam","concentration (composition); nitrogen cycle; nitrogen dioxide; sandy loam; semiarid region; silty loam; source apportionment; China; Heilongjiang",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105665061

We distributed the survey to a representative sample of Rhode Island residents (N = 844). We find that respondents who believe that Rhode Island would be joining the policy for the first time have a WTP to join of $170 (quite similar to previous research at a national scale), whereas those who believe Rhode Island is already part of the policy are willing to pay 2.5 times more, or $420, to stay in the program. Our results suggest that citizens greatly prefer existing carbon mitigation policies to new policies, which implies that carbon policy will be more successful if enacted through the legislature instead of popular vote. © 2021 The Author(s).

(Plug-in) hybrid electric propulsion concepts offer the possibility to reduce emissions as well as total cost of ownership (TCO) for public transport vehicles (e.g. bus application). In this context, typically diesel engines are used to form the hybrid propulsion system of the vehicle. Gaseous fuels represent an attractive alternative to diesel for both ecologic and economic reasons. In the framework of the research project 'Optimised Real-world Cost-Competitive Modular Hybrid Architecture' (ORCA), which was funded by the EU, two different hybrid electric propulsion concepts have been investigated: one using a diesel engine as internal combustion engine and one using CNG engine. The aim of the current study is to analyse specific benefits for the aforementioned hybrid propulsion systems for representative driving scenarios with regard to emissions (e.g. NOx and CO2) and total cost of ownership in bus application. Engine models based on experimental data for diesel and CNG were developed to estimate the emissions from engine torque and rotational speed. For designing optimal energy management strategies for each propulsion system, maps-driven quasi-static models for specific engine types are used in this study. This paper compares the two aforementioned propulsion concepts regarding their CO2 and NOxemissions. This comparison is performed for relevant bus missions (urban, suburban, with and without zero-emission zone) and with different energy management strategies. In addition to the emissions, also the downsizing potential of the combustion engine has been analysed to minimize the powertrain TCO (pTCO) for plug-in hybrid electric buses. The results of the performed analyses show that the hybrid propulsion concept using the CNG engine shows advantages both with respect to emissions as well as to pTCO. The pTCO is 10% lower, CO2 emissions are 13% lower and the NOx emissions are more than 50% lower than with the diesel combustion engine. These results are consistent across all usage profiles under investigation. © 2021 IEEE.","Bus Transport; CNG; emissions; hybrid propulsion; pTCO","Air pollution; Bus transportation; Carbon dioxide; Combustion; Combustion equipment; Costs; Diesel engines; Electric propulsion; Energy management; Nitrogen oxides; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; Combustion engines; Energy management strategies; Hybrid architectures; Hybrid propulsion systems; Propulsion concept; Public transport vehicles; Quasi static models; Total cost of ownership; Automobile engines",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85113334553

Moreover, hydrogen can supply the 3 most energy intense sectors, i.e. transport, heat and electricity, allowing the sector coupling. To do so, a production unit, the electrolyser, and a consumer one, the fuel cell, are needed. Actually, reversible Solid Oxide Cell technology presents the possibility to install only one device acting bi-directionally. It offers different advantages thank to its (i) compact design, thus ensuring space and cost savings; (ii) ability to meet thermal and electric demand, thus reducing emissions in both those sectors; (iii) possibility to store, the electricity excess coming from renewable sources in form of hydrogen, ensuring an unlimited and seasonal storage possibility. In this study, the deployment of a real reversible Solid Oxide Cell was simulated in different scenarios considering the data recorded in one year in the island of Procida, Italy. Up to date, the use of this technology was mostly relegated to the industrial sector or to prototype tests. While, this research aimed to analyse the functioning of near commercialization technology in civil environments such as hotels, offices and hospitals to understand its feasibility in this new context. It wants to be proved that advantages of this emerging technology can be exploited as well in the civil environment. Three economic indicators, i.e. Payback Period, Internal Return Rate and Net Present Value were selected to evaluate the simulated scenarios, while, the primary energy saving, the emission reduction and its storage efficacy were studied to evaluate the environmental achievements. To perform the simulations, the MATLAB model ConfigDym built by Sylfen was used. Finally, a sensitivity analysis in terms of economics was carried out. The results show an important decrease in emissions and an energy self-sufficiency increase of at least 29% and 58% respectively, differently the economic analysis returns a payback period currently near to its lifetime, while for the future a three years period is reachable. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Hybrid energy storage system; Island sustainability; rSOC electrolyser and fuel cell; Small scale power to gas; Solar hydrogen integration in buildings","Digital storage; Economic analysis; Electric energy storage; Emission control; Energy conservation; Environmental technology; Hydrogen storage; Investments; MATLAB; Renewable energy resources; Sensitivity analysis; Solar power generation; Solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC); Cell-be; Cell/B.E; Cell/BE; Hybrid energy storage systems; Island sustainability; Payback periods; Reversible solid oxide cells; RSOC electrolyser and fuel cell; Small scale power to gas; Solar hydrogen integration in building; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102446993

Conventional welfare economics recommends the use of comprehensive pricing of carbon emissions, which may not necessarily be the most effective approach in transport systems. This paper uses an evolutionary technology diffusion model to simulate the impact of climate policies on passenger car emissions in the US, UK, Japan, China and India up to 2050, seeking to understand policy interaction. We analyse six commonly seen policy instruments and explore systematically the impact of combining each of these policies by developing 63 scenarios for the US, the UK, China, Japan, and India. We assess both the policies’ effectiveness in achieving emissions reductions and their cost-effectiveness in doing so. We show how the diffusion dynamics of the system can lead to interaction of policy levers, generating synergies in some cases (combined effectiveness more than the sum of its parts), and mutual impediment effects in others (combined effectiveness less than the sum of its parts). The paper identifies particular combinations of regulatory, procurement and fiscal policies that are particularly effective at generating rapid change without needing the use of very high fuel taxes or carbon pricing. Notably, combining electric vehicle mandates with taxes and regulations on combustion vehicles is highly effective, as it simultaneously improves the availability of low-carbon options while penalising high carbon options.

An increased risk for high emissions can occur in connection with process disturbances and nitrite (NO2-) accumulation. This work describes the findings at a large municipal wastewater treatment plant where the levels of NO2- in the activated sludge process effluent were spontaneously and strongly increased on several activated sludge lines which was suspected to be due to shortcut nitrogen removal that stabilized for several months. The high NO2- levels were linked to a dramatic increase in nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. As much as over 20% of the daily influent nitrogen load was emitted as N2O. These observations indicate that highly increased NO2- levels can occur in conventional activated sludge processes and result in high nitrous oxide emissions. They also raise questions concerning the risk of increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of the nitritation–denitritation processes – although the uncontrolled nature of the event described here must be taken into consideration – and underline the importance of continuous monitoring and control of N2O emissions. © 2021 The Authors Water Science & Technology","GHG; N2O; Nitritation–denitritation; Nitrous oxide; NO2; | activated sludge process","Carbon footprint; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Sewage pumping plants; Sewage treatment plants; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Activated sludge; Continuous monitoring; Conventional activated sludges; Municipal wastewater treatment plants; Nitrogen removal process; Nitrous oxide emissions; Process disturbances; Short-cut nitrogen removals; Activated sludge process; ammonia; calcium hydroxide; dissolved oxygen; ferrous sulfate; methanol; nitrate; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; phosphorus; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; activated sludge; carbon footprint; effluent; greenhouse gas; nitrogen; nitrous oxide; sludge; activated sludge; alkalinity; Article; carbon footprint; carbon source; denitrification; environmental impact; environmental monitoring; municipal wastewater; nitrification; nitrous oxide emission; pH; precipitation; sampling; waste water management; bioreactor; sewage; wastewater; Bioreactors; Nitrogen; Nitrous Oxide; Sewage; Waste Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106337982

However, CFD models are computationally intensive in nature, and therefore, several developments have been made in building computationally efficient models. The existing computationally efficient models in the field of high-consequence rare events are temporally static in nature and do not represent system evolution with time, which is crucial for consequence modeling of rare events. Further, the consequences depend on various parameters in addition to inputs. Since it is not affordable to construct a new model for every parameter value, incorporation of inputs and parameters is an additional challenge in developing a consequence model. Hence, to address these challenges, this work proposes a k-nearest neighbor (kNN)-based parametric reduced-order model (PROM) for consequence estimation of rare events to enhance numerical robustness with respect to parameter change. Specifically, local (with respect to parameters) ROMs are constructed based on multivariable output-error state space (MOESP) algorithm for a range of parameters, and they are linearly interpolated to estimate consequences at a new parameter value. The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through a case study of supercritical carbon dioxide release rare event. © 2021","Consequence estimation; K-nearest neighbor model; Parametric reduced-order model; Rare events","Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Chemical analysis; Chemical industry; Computational efficiency; Computational fluid dynamics; Nearest neighbor search; Supercritical fluid extraction; Chemical process industry; Computationally efficient; Consequence estimation; Consequence modeling; K nearest neighbor (KNN); Numerical robustness; Reduced order models; Supercritical carbon dioxides; Parameter estimation",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104981536

It is also useful for tracking sustainable growth, including urban resource planning, climate change, and agriculture research. By learning to use aerial imagery to automatically generate building images, segmentation techniques are becoming crucial to scaling the mapping attempts. The latest research approaches suggest that Neural Network Architectures have significance in overcoming the limitations caused by traditional segmentation techniques. However, it was still uncertain if the segmentation model was properly implemented owing to the main problem of large size and high resolution in pixel-level image segmentation. In this research work, using the Cascaded MultiResUnet Proposal Masking Convolutional Network (CMPMCN) method, segmentation of the multiscale aerial imagery is presented. The Cascaded dilated MultiResUNet method is used for identifying and achieving better objects extraction in aerial images, and also the proposal masking method is used to train for generating masks of the region at every feature map. The approach has achieved 69.2% IoU score with 980M total parameter quantity, and 3∗12H training duration.

Such circumstances, leading to the expansion of salt-affected areas, are assumed to become climate change, rising of groundwater levels and its mineralizations, poor functioning of the collector-drainage system, and insufficient compliance with agro-technical requirements. These drivers, in turn, lead to the withdrawal of arable land for agricultural purposes and a significant drop in crop yields. Regarding Uzbekistan, this research on soil salinity assessment was conducted in the irrigated areas of the Sirdarya province by analyzing raw data derived from traditional methods from 2000 to 2015, as well as from 2016 to 2019, using the integrated traditional and geographic information systems (GIS)–based methods. Soil salinity maps of the Sirdarya province were created to investigate spatial and temporal changes in soil salinity using the inverse distance weighting (IDW) interpolation method based on the results of field survey and laboratory studies. The results of this research revealed that the IDW interpolation method had a great potential and accuracy to map longitudinal changes in salt-affected irrigated areas. Moreover, it was determined that soil salinity highly depends on local terrain conditions and there is a weak dependence on climatic factors. The main findings of this research advocate agricultural specialists and local farmers to get distinctly encouraged to take the following measures to address the actual soil salinity state in the irrigated areas of the province: targeted and economic use of irrigation water; existing drainage networks are in perfect working condition and monitoring their full effective operation; and, lastly, accelerating the integration of innovative GIS technologies into traditional methods. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Climate change; GIS; IDW; Interpolation; Irrigation; Sirdarya province; Soil salinity; Statistical analysis; Uzbekistan","Agricultural robots; Data privacy; Drainage; Food supply; Geographic information systems; Groundwater; Interpolation; Inverse problems; Irrigation; Soils; Water management; Agricultural development; Agricultural purpose; Interpolation method; Inverse distance weighting; Laboratory studies; Space-time dynamics; Spatial and temporal changes; Technical requirement; Climate change; ground water; arable land; climate change; crop yield; GIS; interpolation; irrigation; salinity; spatiotemporal analysis; statistical analysis; terrain; Article; climate change; controlled study; electric conductivity; geographic information system; inverse distance weighting interpolation method; irrigation (agriculture); measurement accuracy; mineralization; monitoring; physical parameters; precipitation; soil analysis; soil salinity; Uzbekistan; Aral Sea; Sirdaryo; Uzbekistan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105727823

The properties of HSs are discussed in terms of microbial utilization, degradation, and transformation. The data on biologically active individual compounds found in HSs are summarized. Bacteria of the phylum Proteobacteria and fungi of the phyla Basidiomycota and Ascomycota were found to be the main HS degraders, while Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Firmicutes were found to be the predominant phyla in humic-reducing microorganisms (HRMs). Some promising aspects of interactions between microorganisms and HSs are discussed as a feasible basis for nature-like biotechnologies, including the production of enzymes capable of catalyzing the oxidative binding of organic pollutants to HSs, while electron shuttling through the utilization of HSs by HRMs as electron shuttles may be used for the enhancement of organic pollutant biodegradation or lowering bioavailability of some metals. Utilization of HSs by HRMs as terminal electron acceptors may suppress electron transfer to CO2, reducing the formation of CH4 in temporarily anoxic systems. The data reported so far are mostly related to the use of HSs as redox compounds. HSs are capable of altering the composition of the microbial community, and there are environmental conditions that determine the efficiency of HSs. To facilitate the development of HS-based technologies, complex studies addressing these factors are in demand. © 2021 by the authors.

The 50- and 100-year return period levels of the typhoon-induced surge height on the seas covering the Korean Peninsula are obtained by adopting extreme value analysis with the two most widely applied probability distributions: the generalized extreme value (GEV) and Weibull distributions. The extreme values used in the above extreme value analysis are obtained from the deterministic Sea, Lake, and Overland Surges from Hurricanes model after validation. The statistical estimation is validated by satisfying the hypothesis testing procedure with respect to the form of a probability distribution using chi-squared (Chi-S) and Kolmogorov–Smirnov (K–S) goodness-of-fit tests. The optimal curves consisting of a bird’s-eye view of the return period levels of the typhoon-induced surge heights are selected by evaluating the statistical performance indicators of the goodness-of-fit tests, namely the weighted sum χ2 and supremum Dn of the Chi-S and K–S goodness-of-fit tests, respectively. In this research, the GEV distribution-based fitting curves are selected as the best-fit curves. The increasing pattern of its inverse cumulative distribution function tends to capture the extreme values of the typhoon-induced surge height. Since the numerically obtained typhoon-induced surge heights were employed to visualize the return period levels of the typhoon-induced surges on the seas of Korea, this approach provides more detailed information for the management of SLR-related natural hazards to coastal populations. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. part of Springer Nature.","Extreme value analysis; Goodness-of-fit test; Meteorological sea level rise; SLOSH; Typhoon-induced surge heights","coastal zone management; extreme event; hazard management; storm surge; typhoon; wave height; Weibull theory; South Korea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100811199

The main objective of the current study was to investigate the properties of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) emitted from biomass burning of solid fuels in different cookstoves mostly of relevance to sub- Saharan east Africa. The traditional three-stone fire and a rocket stove were used for combustion of wood logs of Sesbania and Casuarina with birch used as a reference. A natural draft and a forced-draft pellet stove were used for combustion of pelletised Sesbania and pelletised Swedish softwood alone or in mixtures with pelletised coffee husk, rice husk or water hyacinth. The CCN activity and the effective density were measured for particles with mobility diameters of v65, v100 and v200 nm, respectively, and occasionally for 350 nm particles. Particle number size distributions were measured online with a fast particle analyser. The chemical composition of the fuel ash was measured by application of standard protocols. The average particle number size distributions were by number typically dominated by an ultrafine mode, and in most cases a soot mode was centred around a mobility diameter of v150 nm. The CCN activities decreased with increasing particle size for all experiments and ranged in terms of the hygroscopicity parameter, from v0:1 to v0:8 for the ultrafine mode and from v0:001 to v0:15 for the soot mode. The CCN activity of the ultrafine mode increased (i) with increasing combustion temperature for a given fuel, and (ii) it typically increased with increasing potassium concentration in the investigated fuels. The primary CCN and the estimated particulate matter (PM) emission factors were typically found to increase significantly with increasing potassium concentration in the fuel for a given stove. In order to link CCN emission factors to PM emission factors, knowledge about stove technology, stove operation and the inorganic fuel ash composition is needed. This complicates the use of ambient PM levels alone for estimation of CCN concentrations in regions dominated by biomass combustion aerosol, with the relation turning even more complex when accounting for atmospheric ageing of the aerosol. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

The flame was a conical one stabilized by a thin transverse rod. The Reynolds numbers were varied within 400-3000, and the fuel equivalence ratios were 0.8-1.4. Such a flame can take the shape of two fundamentally different types: M-when the flame front attaches both to the nozzle edge and stabilization rod; V-only to the stabilization rod. The transition conditions from one front configuration to another (M-V and V-M) were studied under various excitation parameters. Acoustic disturbances with a frequency of up to 420 Hz and an amplitude of longitudinal velocity pulsations up to 10% of the mean flow velocity excited the flame. New experimental data were obtained on the conditions corresponding to the M-V and V-M transitions. Qualitative and quantitative parameters of the hysteresis effect at which M-V and V-M transitions are realized, similar to the case of swirling flames, were revealed. The frequencies at which the acoustics most strongly affects the M-V and V-M transitions conditions were found. The hysteresis deterioration for M-V and V-M transitions was shown for the first time.

The H and O escapes are shown to be regulated in a stoichiometric 2:1 ratio in a converged model of present-day Mars over a timescale of ∼105 yr, which is called self-regulation. Self-regulation timescales under different atmospheric conditions on early Mars are not well understood. Here we use a 1D photochemical model to calculate the timescales of self-regulation for denser CO2 atmospheres with various surface temperatures as benchmark cases for early Mars. Self-regulation is driven by variations in the amount of O2 or CO in the atmosphere, depending on the atmospheric redox state. Self-regulation timescales are likely to be controlled by the net redox balance. A 1 bar CO2 atmosphere with a surface temperature of 240 K has a self-regulation timescale of a few million years. Denser atmospheres of early Mars have a longer regulation timescale and are less redox-stable than the atmosphere of present-day Mars. Obliquity variations cause atmospheric CO2 fluctuations, producing a difference in the self-regulation timescale between high and low obliquity. Because an increase in CO2 suppresses H escape, the net effect of the obliquity cycle could have driven the atmospheric redox states to be more reducing. Our results also suggest the possibility of a CO-dominated atmosphere of 10-100 mbars at 3 Ga. The redox state of ancient Mars might have fluctuated more easily than that of the present. © 2021.

It was determined that the inhibition of the processes of CO absorption with increasing water scarcity begins in the studied species with a decrease in soil moisture to 35% field capacity. Under conditions of soil drought, the amount of CO absorbed by Prunus laurocerasus leaves is reduced by 10 times, Laurus nobilis - by 7 times, Viburnum tinus - by 2 times.

If only one country does not compensate low-income households for disproportionate damages, the social cost of carbon tends to increase globally. Optimal carbon prices remain roughly unchanged if national redistribution leaves inequality between households unaffected by climate change and if the utility of households is approximately logarithmic in consumption. © 2021 The Authors","Carbon tax; Climate change; Inequality; Optimal taxation; Social cost of carbon","Carbon; Climate change; Taxation; Carbon price; Low incomes; National level; Optimal taxation; Social cost of carbon; Costs; cost analysis; emissions trading; environmental economics; equity; numerical method; optimization; pollution tax; social behavior",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103967794

However, the current structure of the agricultural system works against meeting these expectations. The spatial separation of crop and livestock farms has created negative environmental consequences, and bioenergy production has created a trade-off between food and energy production. In this paper, we explore the opportunities for ecological intensification at a regional scale made possible by combining food and energy production. We built three scenarios representing farming systems including biogas production using grass biomass and manure. These scenarios included the following: (a) The current system with energy production (CSE) from non-edible agricultural biomasses (CSE). (b) Agroecological symbiosis (AES) identical to CSE except with 20% of the arable cropping area converted to clover-grasses for use in biogas production. (c) Agroecological symbiosis with livestock (AES-LST) where the available grass biomass (20% as in the AES) is fed to livestock and manure then used as a feedstock in biogas production. In each scenario, nutrients were circulated back to crops in the form of digestate. The supply of soil functions (primary production for food and energy, provision of nutrient cycling, and climate mitigation) and impacts on water quality through nutrient losses in these three scenarios were then compared to the current system. Integrating biogas production into food production resulted in an increased supply of nutrient recycling, reduced nutrient losses, and increased carbon inputs to the soils indicating enhanced climate mitigation. Food production was either not affected (CSE), increased (AES-LST), or decreased (AES), and biogas was produced in substantial quantities in each scenario. Our study demonstrated potential synergies in integrating food and energy production without compromising other ecosystem services in each scenario. © 2021 The Authors.

This model describes cause-and-effect relations between dynamic processes in weather, seasonal and climate terms and resolves the interannual variability problem. In this context, the principal reason to destroy rapidly the habitual local seasonal patterns seems to be connected with variation of parameters associated with the abilities of local ecosystems to influence on dynamics evolution and to ""damp""transient overshoots generated by the HDS-control. Reconstructions made by processing the meteorological observations show that such destructions can be promoted by natural climate-related oscillations.

However, so far, little is known about the relationship between Muslim communities and climate change. Globally, Muslims constitute the second largest faith group, and there is a strong concentration of Muslims in regions that are particularly affected by global warming. This review synthesizes existing research about climate change and Muslim communities. It addresses (a) Islamic environmentalism, (b) Muslim perceptions of climate change, and (c) mitigation strategies of Muslim communities. The analysis shows that there is no uniform interpretation of climate change among Muslims. Based on their interpretations of Islam, Muslims have generated different approaches to climate change. A small section of Muslim environmentalists engages in public campaigning to raise greater concern about climate change, seeks to reduce carbon emissions through sociotechnological transition efforts, and disseminates proenvironmental interpretations of Islam. However, it remains unclear to what extent these activities generate broader changes in the daily activities of Muslim communities and organizations. Contributions to this research field are often theoretical and stress theological and normative aspects of Islam. Empirical studies have particularly addressed Indonesia and the United Kingdom, whereas knowledge about Muslim climate activism in other world regions is fragmented. Against this backdrop, there is a need for comparative studies that consider regional and religious differences among Muslims and address the role of Muslim environmentalism in climate change mitigation and adaptation at the international, national, and local scales.

Hence, every impact on every scale has a significant role. Those properties of the networks are decisive on the global ecosystem, so how they will be modified by climate change needs serious studies. The vast population of the urban areas exerts significant effects on climate change even though they cover a small proportion of the surface of the Earth; however, impacts of urbanization on climate and ecosystems remain inadequately understood. In the meantime, urbanization continues to increase and in 2030, two-thirds of the population is expected to be living in urban areas with an increasing rate in time. It is of great importance to elaborate on the relations between urbanization and climate. In this respect, the use of information technologies with an extensive computational capacity is one of the cornerstones of climate and urban studies. Machine learning is a branch of computer science that deals with the automated recognition of patterns from data. The use of machine learning algorithms can bring significant advantages to both understandings and predicting the climate. The computational power with big data, their ability to capture nonlinear behavior, and learn as new data arrive make machine learning a useful tool for understanding climate and developing urban planning. In this sense, the purpose of this study is to show the advantages of machine learning algorithm by developing a recurrent neural network algorithm to make climate predictions and stating possible effects of machine learning on design and its contribution to understanding the climate. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Architecture; Climate; Climate change; Machine learning; Urban design",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103013659

In this study, the chemical bath deposition (CBD) method was employed due to its simplicity, cheap, low temperature, versatile and it gives better homogeneity. The effect of annealing temperature (Ta) on the thermal, structural, morphological, and optical properties were investigated. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential thermogravimetric analysis (DTGA) showed that the material is thermally stable between 400 and 900 °C. The X-ray diffraction (XRD) results confirmed the cubic Gd2Zr2O7 phase with hexagonal ZnO secondary peaks. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results revealed the transformation of irregular particles to hexagonal-like structure shape with an increase in Ta. Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis confirmed the presence of the expected elements. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) confirmed the nano-nature of the prepared powders. Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis) spectra showed a slightly red shift with an increase in Ta. The photoluminescence (PL) results revealed that the emission intensity and peak position in UV region highly depends on the Ta. It was also noted that both secondary peaks from hexagonal ZnO and Ta regulates the defects emission. The international illumination (CIE) color chromaticity showed that the color shifts from blue to yellow-greenish with an increase in Ta. The approach in the present study opened a new way to tune band gap and luminescence intensity of Gd2Zr2O7. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Annealing temperature; CBD; Gd2Zr2O7; Photoluminescence; ZnO","Chemical analysis; Deposition; Energy dispersive spectroscopy; Energy gap; Gadolinium compounds; High resolution transmission electron microscopy; II-VI semiconductors; Luminescence; Oxide minerals; Powders; Red Shift; Scanning electron microscopy; Tantalum metallography; Temperature; Ultraviolet visible spectroscopy; Uranium metallography; Vanadium metallography; Zinc oxide; Zirconium compounds; Annealing temperatures; Chemical bath deposition methods; Chemical-bath deposition; Differential thermogravimetric analysis; Effect of annealing; Energy dispersive X ray spectroscopy; Gadolinium zirconate; Luminescence intensity; Thermogravimetric analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099693715

Biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation worldwide require the formation of new concepts of ecological restoration and rehabilitation aimed at improving ecosystem functions, services, and biodiversity conservation in cities. Although relict sites of natural and semi-natural ecosystems can be found in urban areas, environmental conditions and species composition of most urban ecosystems are highly modified, inducing the development of novel and hybrid ecosystems. A consequence of this ecological novelty is the lack of (semi-) natural reference systems available for defining restoration targets and assessing restoration success in urban areas. This hampers the implementation of ecological restoration in cities. In consideration of these challenges, we present a new conceptual framework that provides guidance and support for urban ecological restoration and rehabilitation by formulating restoration targets for different levels of ecological novelty (i.e., historic, hybrid, and novel ecosystems). To facilitate the restoration and rehabilitation of novel urban ecosystems, we recommend using established species-rich and well-functioning urban ecosystems as reference. Such urban reference systems are likely to be present in many cities. Highlighting their value in comparison to degraded ecosystems can stimulate and guide restoration initiatives. As urban restoration approaches must consider local history and site conditions, as well as citizens’ needs, it may also be advisable to focus the restoration of strongly altered urban ecosystems on selected ecosystem functions, services and/or biodiversity values. Ecosystem restoration and rehabilitation in cities can be either relatively inexpensive or costly, but even expensive measures can pay off when they effectively improve ecosystem services such as climate change mitigation or recreation. Successful re-shaping and re-thinking of urban greenspace by involving citizens and other stakeholders will help to make our cities more sustainable in the future. © 2021 The Author(s)","Biodiversity; Hybrid ecosystem; Native species; Novel ecosystem; Reference system; Restoration target; Urban ecosystem; Urban grassland; Urban greenspace; Urban woodland",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102422311

The majority of respondents support purchase incentives and most regulations, whereas support is considerably lower for a carbon tax. Factor analysis identifies three different types of trust in key actors: competence, integrity, and value similarity. Fewer than 50% of respondents trust their national or provincial government regarding climate change issues in general or according to each type of trust. Regression analysis assesses the role of trust in policy support, while controlling for respondent values and demographic characteristics. Perceptions of national government “competence” is the only trust variable that is consistently positively associated with support for all five policies tested.

We map the fragmentation of this policy arena and explore the extent to which the NRAP is able to integrate policy responses to drivers to achieve emissions reductions. We examine what the NRAP sought to integrate, what was not taken into account, what is integrated at which scale, and which actors are part of integration (or not) across the policy process components.

Using the hydride vapor phase epitaxy (HVPE) method, we have overcome all of the aforementioned obstacles. In a previous study, we realized GaN homoepitaxial layers with greater purity than the best MOCVD-grown layers by removing quartz components from the high-temperature region of the HVPE apparatus. In the present study, the concentration of residual carbon was further reduced to less than 3 × 1014 cm-3 by removing carbon components near the wafer. In addition, the concentrations of major electron traps widely observed in homoepitaxial GaN layers were substantially reduced to the 1012-1013 cm-3 range via further modification of the HVPE conditions/apparatus to suppress etching of a stainless-steel flange of the HVPE reactor. The results imply that stainless-steel-related impurities such as Fe and Cr are the most likely cause of the major electron traps although native point defects have long been considered their origin. The resultant GaN layers, which showed substantially improved optical and electrical properties, did not exhibit a trade-off relationship between the concentrations of carbon and electron traps. © 2021 Author(s).",,"Carbon; Economic and social effects; Electron traps; Electrons; Etching; III-V semiconductors; Metallorganic chemical vapor deposition; Organic chemicals; Organometallics; Point defects; Power semiconductor devices; Stainless steel; A3. metal organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD); Homoepitaxial layers; Hydride vapor phase epitaxy; Native point defects; Optical and electrical properties; Related impurities; Simultaneous reduction; Trade-off relationship; Gallium nitride",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105595412

These loading schemes are intended to represent variable boundary conditions for a strengthened beam (properly insulated) when a fire takes place in a building. A total of 54 specimens are tested under angled peel-off conditions, 30 to 60 degrees, combined with thermal distress incurred by temperatures ranging from 25 to 150°C (77 to 302°C). As the peeling angle increases, the load-carrying capacity of the CFRP-concrete interface dramatically decreases, which is expedited when elevated temperatures are associated. The characteristic load, determined from energy dissipation, reaffirms that the interface is vulnerable to the angular loadings. On the load-displacement responses, stick-slip motions along the bond line result in locally fluctuating interfacial resistance after the onset of CFRP debonding, which creates traction-free fracture surfaces. The debonding rate in a prepeak load stage differs from that in the postpeak stage, and this observation becomes prominent at elevated temperatures owing to a change in the energy release of the interface. The angular loading is more engaged with the shear component of interfacial fracture energy (GII) than with the opening component (GI); nonetheless, their ratio (GI/GII) is not affected by the thermal loading. With an increase in temperature over 125°C (257°F), the angular loading’s influence on the fracture energy diminishes because the applied load is distributed along the softened interface. Among the three constituents in the interfacial energy, the deformation component is least dominant, followed by the fracture and debonding components. A statistical assessment supports the significance of the thermomechanical loadings at a confidence level of 5%. Copyright © 2021, American Concrete Institute.

This micro-climate change can affect vegetation phenology. It can advance leaf unfolding and flowering and delay the timing of fallen leaves. This study was carried out to clarify the impact of urbanization on the leaf unfolding of Mongolian oak. The survey sites for this study were established in the urban center (Mts. Nam, Mido, and Umyeon in Seoul), suburbs (Mts. Cheonggye and Buram in Seoul), a rural area (Gwangneung, Mt. Sori in Gyeonggi-do), and a natural area (Mt. Jeombong in Gangwon-do). Green-up dates derived from the analyses of digital camera images and MODIS satellite images were the earliest in the urban center and delayed through the suburbs and rural area to the natural area. The difference in the observed green-up date compared to the expected one, which was determined by regarding the Mt. Jeombong site located in the natural area as the reference site, was the biggest in the urban center and decreased through the suburbs and rural area to the natural area. Green-up dates in the rural area, suburbs, and urban center were earlier by 11.0, 14.5, and 16.3 days than the expected ones. If these results are transformed into the air temperature based on previous research results, it could be deduced that the air temperature in the urban center, suburbs, and rural area rose by 3.8 to 4.6◦C, 3.3 to 4.1◦C, and 2.5 to 3.1◦C, respectively. Green-up dates derived based on the accumulated growing degree days (AGDD) showed the same trend as those derived from the image interpretation. Green-up dates derived from the change in sap flow as a physiological response of the plant showed a difference within one day from the green-up dates derived from digital camera and MODIS satellite image analyses. The change trajectory of the curvature K value derived from the sap flow also showed a very similar trend to that of the curvature K value derived from the vegetation phenology. From these results, we confirm the availability of AGDD and sap flow as tools predicting changes in ecosystems due to climate change including phenology. Meanwhile, the green-up dates in survey sites were advanced in proportion to the land use intensity of each survey site. Green-up dates derived based on AGDD were also negatively correlated with the land use intensity of the survey site. This result implies that differences in green-up dates among the survey sites and between the expected and observed green-up dates in the urban center, suburbs, and rural area were due to the increased temperature due to land use in the survey sites. Based on these results, we propose conservation and restoration of nature as measures to reduce the impact of climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

However, producers rarely prioritize emission reduction in their day-to-day practices, resulting in a mismatch between global and national environmental policies and local development interests. This raises the urgency of identifying overlapping solution spaces that would address global and national environmental targets and farmers' production goals. Objective: The objective of this study is to identify pathways for scaling LED that better account for divergent smallholder capabilities, strategies, and interests. Methods: A multivariate cluster analysis was used to evaluate producer heterogeneity. The analysis utilized data from 1176 household surveys in Tanzania. Informed by these results, stakeholder workshops were held to identify how each group is uniquely constrained in the adoption of LED practices and viable paths forward. Results and discussions: Our results reveal six distinct farmer types, distinguishable by their asset base, livestock ownership, cattle breeds, access to market, and income diversity. The six groups presented three levels of LED uptake, high, moderate, and low. Variants of technological packages and market-based interventions, access to better quality inputs, and extension services will be more impactful when correctly matched to producers' asset portfolios, interests, and needs for the high and moderately intensifying producers. However, interventions that address both the knowledge and resource gaps for producers who demonstrate low uptake of LED will be more appropriate. Achieving GHG reduction will be modest from already intensifying groups and the low uptake groups, while moderately intensifying groups present the highest leverage for increased GHG reduction potential. This highlights how taking a food system approach rather than a technological package would be more beneficial especially in targeting groups that are not interested in LED. Significance: This study challenges the conceptualization of LED as a simple technological fix. We demonstrate that LED, as currently conceptualized, is not equally accessible or appealing to everyone. Consequently, successful LED uptake is contingent on donor and state ability to match LED strategies, local development priorities, and food systems objectives to develop more targeted needs-driven implementation pathways. © 2021 The Authors","Dairy; Intensification; Low-emission development; Mitigation; Pathways; Social differentiation","agricultural emission; cattle; cluster analysis; emission control; greenhouse gas; heterogeneity; livestock; performance assessment; smallholder; Tanzania",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101380067

It is the purpose of this paper to investigate the effect of grid-connected large-scale wind farms in a region in Iran, on the reduction of natural gas consumptions in heat-cycle power plants and their related CO2 emissions as a practical case study. The wind farms under study comprise about 51% of the total grid connected capacity of wind generation in Iran. First, the total energy yielded by the considered wind farms are extracted for a two-year period from April 2019 to March 2021 based on a detailed practical data and then, the impact of this renewable-based energy generation is studied on the reduction of natural gas consumption in a real gas-cycle power plant due to its practical fuel intake data. The financial revenue of savings in the natural gas intake is also estimated based on the two-year average international price of natural gas. Finally, the reduction of CO2 emission is calculated as the result of reduction in the natural gas consumption of the considered gas-cycle power plant. The results of this practical case study well demonstrate the effective role of wind farms energy generation on the reduction of fossil fuels consumption in heat-cycle power plants and thus, the significant reduction of CO2 emissions as one of the most crucial aspects of decarbonization plans. © 2021 IEEE.","CO2emission; gas-cycle power plant; natural gas consumption; wind farm","Carbon dioxide; Electric power plants; Electric power system interconnection; Electric power transmission networks; Electric utilities; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Power plant intakes; Wind power; Electrical energy; Energy generations; Gas consumption; Grid-connected capacities; Large-scale wind farms; Natural gas consumption; Practical fuels; Wind generation; Fossil fuel power plants",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85114203433

There are many factors that trigger climate change, and there are many aftereffects. One of the after-effects is Urban Heat Island (UHI), recognized as the most evident characteristic of urban climate which occurs due to dark, non-reflective surfaces. These surfaces absorb the warmth of the Sun, radiate heat; Thus, increase the land surface temperature. Additionally, heat islands increase cooling loads in the summer, which tends to increase energy consumption and produce more greenhouse gases. There are numerous strategies to mitigate the UHI effect. This study reviews various UHI mitigation strategies and their effectiveness in cooling the urban environment and propose a set of recommendation based on research and analysis. Broadly, the mitigation strategies have been divided into (i) Roof strategies, (ii) non-roof strategies, and (iii) covered parking strategies. It has been found out that the simultaneous use of several UHI mitigation measures has a more significant impact on lowering the urban temperature and could be mitigated. The study highlights the importance of each mitigation strategy and presents a set of recommendations for India that can be directed at the government level to policies to mitigate the UHI effect. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Cool roof; Mitigation strategies; Urban heat island; Vegetation",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104357738

Biobased alternatives, such as biodiesel and renewable jet fuel (RJF) produced from oilseeds, have lower GHG emissions than their petroleum counterparts, are renewable in nature, and support energy security. Thus, the objective of this review was to analyze the information on different oilseed types and characteristics along with their production, harvest and post-harvest operations; oilseeds conversion to biodiesel and RJF along with their properties and uses; and their cost and environmental status in the USA. More than 80% of the feedstock currently used for biodiesel production in the USA consists of edible oilseeds, including soybean, corn, and canola. Carinata and pennycress are inedible oilseeds that are promising feedstock for biodiesel and RJF production. The biodiesel and RJF produced from oilseeds have similar density, calorific value and cetane number while having lower acid value and sulfur content compared to their petroleum counterparts. At the current state of technology, the retail prices for biodiesel (B20) are 1.0–1.4 times, and RJF are 3–4 times higher than their petroleum counterparts. However, GHG emissions of oilseed-based biodiesel and RJF are 37–92% and 32–121% lower than their petroleum counterparts, respectively.

Forest ecosystems are a significant factor in this regard as they act both as a sink and a source of carbon. Forest carbon evaluation has received more attention after the Paris Agreement. Pakistan has 5.1% forest cover of its total land area, which comprises nine forest types. This study covers the studies conducted on above-ground biomass and carbon stock in various forest types of Pakistan. Most of the studies on biomass and carbon stock estimation have been conducted during 2015–2020. The non-destructive method is mostly followed for carbon stock estimation, followed by remote sensing. The destructive method is used only for developing allometric equations and biomass expansion factors. The information available on the carbon stock and biomass of Pakistan forest types is fragmented and sporadic. Coniferous forests are more important in carbon sequestration and can play a vital role in mitigating climate change. Pakistan is a signatory of the Kyoto Protocol and still lacks regional and national level studies on biomass and carbon stock, which are necessary for reporting under the Kyoto Protocol.

We evaluated the associations of short-term exposure to air pollutants with systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) and the long-term impact of air pollutants on incident hypertension, among Tehranian adults. In the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study, 4580 nonhypertensive participants aged 20–69 years (41.6% male) were followed from 2001 to 2018 through 3-year follow-ups and 4–5 examinations of them were recorded. The air pollutants included particulate matter with a diameter ≤10 μm (PM10), carbon monoxide (CO), ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and sulfur dioxide (SO2). The mixed-effects transition model estimated the air pollution impact on BP. The proportional hazards Weibull model measured the long-term effects of air pollutants on the multivariate hazard of incident hypertension. The air pollutants were put in the models in the form of mean annual level, applying three versions of 1, 2, and 3 years before the follow-ups. During a median follow-up of 12.3 years, 1618 cases of hypertension were found. In the short-term, increase in CO did not affect SBP but decreased DBP with a delay effect lasting for 14 days; increase in NO2 raised SBP with a 14-day lag, however did not change DBP; increase in O3 reduced SBP with a 14-day lag but made slight non-significant increase in DBP; rise in PM10 concentrations led to increased SBP (lag 0–3 days) and DBP with lags of 0–3 days and 12–14 days and increase in SO2 made the largest increases in DBP with lags lasting for 14 days, but did not affect SBP. Regarding incident hypertension in the long-term, the increase in CO had no significant effect; increase in NO2 decreased the risk over the 2- and 3-year time spans; rise in O3, PM10, and SO2 levels increased the risk in all time spans; the largest hazard ratio [1.96 (95% CI: 1.48, 2.62)] for incident hypertension was attributable to PM10 in 3 years. Considering the major effects of air pollutants including O3, SO2, and especially PM10 on incident hypertension, urgent public health policies should be implemented to reduce the burden of air pollution in metropolitan city of Tehran. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Air pollution; Diastolic blood pressure; Hypertension; Longitudinal; Systolic blood pressure; TLGS","nitrogen dioxide; ozone; sulfur dioxide; adult; adverse event; air pollutant; air pollution; blood pressure; environmental exposure; epidemiology; female; human; Iran; male; particulate matter; Adult; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Blood Pressure; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Iran; Male; Nitrogen Dioxide; Ozone; Particulate Matter; Sulfur Dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101915835

Here, we use nine PM2.5 concentration models (i.e., exposure models) that span a wide range of methods to investigate i) PM2.5 concentrations in 2011, ii) potential changes in PM2.5 concentrations between 2011 and 2028 due to on-the-books regulations, and iii) PM2.5 exposure for the U.S. population and four racial/ethnic groups. The exposure models included two geophysical chemical transport models (CTMs), two interpolation methods, a satellite-derived aerosol optical depth-based method, a Bayesian statistical regression model, and three data-rich machine learning methods. We focused on annual predictions that were regridded to 12-km resolution over the conterminous U.S., but also considered 1-km predictions in sensitivity analyses. The exposure models predicted broadly consistent PM2.5 concentrations, with relatively high concentrations on average over the eastern U.S. and greater variability in the western U.S. However, differences in national concentration distributions (median standard deviation: 1.00 μg m-3) and spatial distributions over urban areas were evident. Further exploration of these differences and their implications for specific applications would be valuable. PM2.5 concentrations were estimated to decrease by about 1 μg m-3 on average due to modeled emission changes between 2011 and 2028, with decreases of more than 3 μg m-3 in areas with relatively high 2011 concentrations that were projected to experience relatively large emission reductions. Agreement among models was closer for population-weighted than uniformly weighted averages across the domain. About 50% of the population was estimated to experience PM2.5 concentrations less than 10 μg m-3 in 2011 and PM2.5 improvements of about 2 μg m-3 due to modeled emission changes between 2011 and 2028. Two inequality metrics were used to characterize differences in exposure among the four racial/ethnic groups. The metrics generally yielded consistent information and suggest that the modeled emission reductions between 2011 and 2028 would reduce absolute exposure inequality on average. © 2020","Air quality modeling; Ensemble modeling; Exposure inequality; PM2.5","aerosol; air quality; article; ethnic group; human; machine learning; optical depth; PM2.5 exposure; prediction; sensitivity analysis; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; Bayes theorem; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; statistical model; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Bayes Theorem; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Statistical; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096126720

In order to be able to increase the number of electric vehicles in circulation, it is important to implement optimal planning and design of the infrastructure, with particular reference to areas equipped with charging stations. The suitable analysis of the location of current electric vehicle charging stations (EVCSs) is the central theme of this document. The research focused on the actual location of the charging stations of five major EVCS companies in the province by selecting Istanbul as the study area. The study was conducted through a three-step approach and specifically (i) the application of the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) method for creating the weights of the 6 main and 18 secondary criteria that influence the location of EVCSs; (ii) a geospatial analysis using GIS considering each criterion and developing the suitability map for the locations of EVCSs, and (iii) application of the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) to evaluate the location performance of current EVCSs. The results show that the ratio between the most suitable and unsuitable areas for the location of EVCSs in Istanbul and the study area is about 5% and 4%, respectively. The results achieved means of improving sustainable urban planning and laying the basis for an assessment of other areas where EVCSs could be placed. © 2021 by the authors.

To gain mechanistic insight, the dependence of these feedbacks on the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) is also investigated in an idealised climate model and the CMIP6 models. For the carbon-concentration feedback, the Atlantic, Pacific and Southern oceans provide comparable contributions when estimated in terms of the volume-integrated carbon storage. This large contribution from the Atlantic Ocean relative to its size is due to strong local physical ventilation and an influx of carbon transported from the Southern Ocean. The Southern Ocean has large anthropogenic carbon uptake from the atmosphere, but its contribution to the carbon storage is relatively small due to large carbon transport to the other basins. For the carbon-climate feedback estimated in terms of carbon storage, the Atlantic and Arctic oceans provide the largest contributions relative to their size. In the Atlantic, this large contribution is primarily due to climate change acting to reduce the physical ventilation. In the Arctic, this large contribution is associated with a large warming per unit volume. The Southern Ocean provides a relatively small contribution to the carbon-climate feedback, due to competition between the climate effects of a decrease in solubility and physical ventilation and an increase in accumulation of regenerated carbon. The more poorly ventilated Indo-Pacific Ocean provides a small contribution to the carbon cycle feedbacks relative to its size. In the Atlantic Ocean, the carbon cycle feedbacks strongly depend on the AMOC strength and its weakening with warming. In the Arctic, there is a moderate correlation between the AMOC weakening and the carbon-climate feedback that is related to changes in carbonate chemistry. In the Pacific, Indian and Southern oceans, there is no clear correlation between the AMOC and the carbon cycle feedbacks, suggesting that other processes control the ocean ventilation and carbon storage there.</p> © Copyright:",,"carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; CMIP; model; ocean acidification",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106963504

Toward closing these knowledge gaps, we analyzed replicated shotgun metagenomes representing distinct life zones and an elevation gradient from four locations in the Luquillo Experimental Forest (LEF), Puerto Rico. These soils had a distinct microbial community composition and lower species diversity compared to those of temperate grasslands or agricultural soils. In contrast to the overall distinct community composition, the relative abundances and nucleotide sequences of N2O reductases (nosZ) were highly similar between tropical forest and temperate soils. However, respiratory NO reductase (norB) was 2-fold more abundant in the tropical soils, which might be relatable to their greater N2O emissions. Nitrogen fixation (nifH) also showed higher relative abundance in rainforest than in temperate soils, i.e., 20% versus 0.1 to 0.3% of bacterial genomes in each soil type harbored the gene, respectively. Finally, unlike temperate soils, LEF soils showed little stratification with depth in the first 0 to 30 cm, with ∼45% of community composition differences explained solely by location. Collectively, these results advance our understanding of spatial diversity and metabolic repertoire of tropical rainforest soil communities and should facilitate future ecological studies of these ecosystems. IMPORTANCE Tropical rainforests are the largest terrestrial sinks of atmospheric CO2 and the largest natural source of N2O emissions, two greenhouse gases that are critical for the climate. The microbial communities of rainforest soils that directly or indirectly, through affecting plant growth, contribute to these fluxes remain poorly described by cultured-independent methods. To close this knowledge gap, the present study applied shotgun metagenomics to samples selected from three distinct life zones within the Puerto Rico rainforest. The results advance our understanding of microbial community diversity in rainforest soils and should facilitate future studies of natural or manipulated perturbations of these critical ecosystems.","diversity; nitrous oxide; nosZ; Puerto Rico; soil microbial communities","RNA 16S; metagenome; metagenomics; microbiology; nitrogen cycle; Puerto Rico; rain forest; Metagenome; Metagenomics; Nitrogen Cycle; Puerto Rico; Rainforest; RNA, Ribosomal, 16S; Soil Microbiology",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107089752

Therefore, we combined the indigenous knowledge about culturally important therapeutic plants and climate change with experimental warming (open-top chambers) and manual clipping (simulated grazing effect) and compared the relative difference on aboveground biomass and percent cover of plant species at five alpine meadow sites on an elevation gradient (4696 m-3346 m) from 2016- 2018. Experimental warming increased biomass and percent cover throughout the experiment. However, the interactive treatment effect (warming x clipping) was significant on biomass but not on percent cover. These responses were taxa specific. Warming induced an increase of 1 ± 0.6% in Bistorta officinalis percent cover while for Poa alpina it was 18.7 ± 4.9%. Contrastingly, clipping had a marginally significant effect in reducing the biomass and cover of all plant species. Clipping treatment reduced vegetation cover & biomass by 2.3% and 6.26%, respectively, but that was not significant due to the high variability among taxa response at different sites. It was found that clipping decreased the effects of warming in interactive plots. Thus, warming may increase the availability of therapeutic plants for indigenous people while overgrazing would have deteriorating effects locally. The findings of this research illustrate that vegetation sensitivity to warming and overgrazing is likely to affect man-environment relationships, and traditional knowledge on a regional scale. © 2021 Karimi et al.",,"adult; article; biomass; Bistorta officinalis; climate change; human; indigenous people; male; nonhuman; overgrazing; Pakistan; simulation; vegetation; warming; cultural anthropology; Pakistan; plant; temperature; Climate Change; Culture; Pakistan; Plants; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105352337

However, little attention has been paid to this issue, and no appropriate action has been taken to address it. Determining the proper duty cycle can be an effective step in reducing emissions and fuel consumption of these vehicles. The duty cycle includes the driving cycle along with the vehicle operating cycle and makes sense for vehicles that have a specific task. In this article, 80,000 experimental data of the wheel loader (WL) in diggings site by global positioning system (GPS) is collected. After filtering, the data is converted to micro-trips and divided into four clusters using the k-means method, and finally, the Markov matrix is produced. The genetic algorithm (GA) is performed to identify the best combination of micro-trips. In this research, two types of cycles, fuel consumption, and emission were derived using the ADVISOR software. The first cycle is the WL operation at the excavation site, and the second cycle is the short loading cycle. Tehran WL duty cycle has higher fuel consumption, nitrogen oxides (NOx), and hydrocarbon (HC) emission than Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) WL and European non-road transient cycle. While the amount of carbon monoxide (CO) produced in the Tehran WL duty cycle is lower than all EPA duty cycles but higher than the European non-road transient cycle. Tehran WL duty cycle fuel consumption is 265% more than the European non-road transient cycle and 86.12% higher than EPA WL typical operation 1 duty cycle. These differences show that each country's cycle is only specific to the same country. A derived WL cycle can be used on vehicles with a similar application such as forklift, aircraft support, and forestry equipment. © 2021 SAE International.","Duty cycle; Emission rate; Fuel consumption; Genetic algorithm; Markov chain","Carbon monoxide; Construction equipment; Environmental Protection Agency; Fuels; Global positioning system; Industrial emissions; K-means clustering; Loaders; Markov chains; Mining machinery; Nitrogen oxides; Roads and streets; Vehicles; Wheels; ADVISOR software; Forestry equipment; Industrial city; K-means method; Non road transient cycles; Operating cycle; Reducing emissions; Specific tasks; Genetic algorithms",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85109867072

Therefore, in order to reduce the detrimental effects of greenhouse gas emissions, the use of cleaner production methods has been accelerated to develop and implement environmentally- friendly energy systems. In this regard, the combination of renewable energy systems and hydrogen production methods will definitely play a crucial role in the energy sector's transition to a carbon-free production. In order to make the use of geothermal energy cleaner and more sustainable, some obstacles need to be eliminated. Most importantly, the hydrogen sulfide emissions may cause serious concerns in public acceptance of geothermal power plants. In the current study, solar, wind and geothermal energy resources are integrated to develop an integrated renewable-based energy system with a key objective of higher environmental and system performance. The underlying motivation is to propose a model which consists of a hydrogen sulfide abatement unit and an electrolyzer to produce hydrogen from hydrogen sulfide and hence eliminites the hydrogen sulfide emissions. A detailed thermodynamic analysis is carried out using Engineering Equation solver (EES) software. In addition, the effects of key design parameters and operating conditions (such as wind inlet speed and average hourly solar radiation) are analyzed, and their effects on the system overall performance are investigated. When 60 kg/s of geothermal fluid is supplied to the designed system, assuming that the NCG composition is equal to 15%, 0.7388 kg hydrogen sulfide will be emitted and 0.0433 kg hydrogen will be produced per second. The first-law (energy) and second-law (exergy) efficiencies are found to be 52.97% and 55.69% respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cleaner production; Electrolysis; Exergy; Hydrogen; Multigeneration; Renewable energy; Solar; Wind","Electrolysis; Energy policy; Exergy; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Geothermal energy; Geothermal power plants; Greenhouse gases; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen sulfide; Pollution control; Radiation effects; Solar power generation; Sulfur determination; Thermoanalysis; Cleaner production; Energy; Energy systems; Fossil fuel resources; Hydrogen generations; Hydrogen sulfide emission; Multi generations; Power; Renewable energies; Solar; Wind",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104075521

Such storage/sequestration is a complex process, dealing with many facets of decision about the site selection, taking into consideration the local geological, geothermal, hydrodynamic and hydrocarbon potentials. In such multifaceted context, a thermo-poro-elastic nonlinear analytic model of fluid pressure P in deep rocks, can play an important role. To tackle this dynamics we here examine a nonlinear model of fluid pressure transient also considering convection, thermal dynamics and fluid/rock ""frictions"". In addition, we here show that pressure dynamics, induced by an eventual external time or areal forcing can allow simple analytical determinations of pressure transients in these deep porous media. Such processes indeed can have practical impacts on the CO2 evolution for storage in deep rocks and thus influence the final site choice for a deep CO2 injection. In synthesis, this model provides simple characterizations of thermo-poro-elastic transients for CO2 storage. © 2021, Editrice Compositori s.r.l..

However, for regulating and supporting ecosystem services that depend on ecosystem structure and function, estimation of economic value requires estimates of the current level of underlying ecological functions first. This primary step is in principle, the job of environmental scientists, not economists. Here, we provide a coarse-level quantitative assessment of the relationship between the research effort expended by environmental scientists (on the biophysical values) and economists (on the monetary values) on 15 different regulating and supporting services in 32 ecosystem types using peer-reviewed article hits retrieved from bibliographic databases as a measure of research effort. We find a positive, moderately strong (r = 0.69) correlation between research efforts in the two domains, a result that, while encouraging, is likely to reflect serendipity rather than the deliberate design of integrated environmental science-economics research programs. Our results suggest that compared to environmental science research effort economic valuation is devoted to a smaller, less diverse set of ecosystem services but a broader, more diverse, set of ecosystem types. The two domains differed more with respect to the ecosystem services that are the major focus of research effort than they did with respect to the ecosystem types of principal research interest. For example, carbon sequestration, erosion regulation, and nutrient cycling receive more relative research effort in the environmental sciences; air quality regulation in economic valuations. For both domains, cultivated areas, wetlands, and urban/semi-urban ecosystem types received relatively large research effort, while arctic and mountain tundra, cave and subterranean, cryosphere, intertidal/littoral zone, and kelp forest ecosystem types received negligible research effort. We suggest ways and means by which the field of sustainability science may be improved by the design and implementation of a searchable database of environmental science and economic valuation literature as well as a global ecosystem service research network and repository that explicitly links research on the estimation and prediction of biophysical ecosystem functions with that of the social sciences and other knowledge systems. These suggestions would, at least in principle, facilitate a more efficient research agenda between economists and environmental scientists and aid management, regulatory and judicial decision-makers. © 2021 Kadykalo et al.

In many cities, heat stress is projected to increase. Urban green spaces are considered as an important resource to strengthen the resilience of city dwellers. We conducted a questionnaire survey in two structurally distinct parks in Leipzig, Germany, on hot summer days in 2019. We assessed the respondents’ activity patterns, satisfaction with the existing infrastructure, heat-related health impairment, changes in park use during heat waves and evaluation of the role of parks in coping with heat stress. We found that the old-grown, tree-rich park was used significantly more frequently for experiencing nature, while the newer, less tree-rich park developed on a former railway-brownfield site was used more often for socializing and having BBQs and picnics. Satisfaction with available drinking fountains and public toilets was generally low and satisfaction with lighting was assessed less satisfactory in the old-grown park. Safety was assessed as satisfactory in general but significantly less satisfactory by female respondents. The heat stress summary score indicating heat-related health impairment was significantly higher for participants in the newer park. A high share of respondents stated that they used parks during heat waves as frequently as usual in the summer (46 %), while some respondents stated that they adapted their park use behaviour (18 %), e.g., by coming later in the evening. Regarding the participants’ responses about the role of parks under summer heat conditions, we matched 138 statements to several regulating and cultural ecosystem services, and we found cooling and recreation to be mentioned most often. We concluded that green space planning should diminish usage barriers, such as insufficient lighting and insufficient sanitary infrastructure, to ensure equal park use opportunities for all city dwellers. Specific local environmental and sociocultural conditions, changing environments and climate adaptation must be considered. To maintain ecological processes and functions and to cope with climate change, urban planning should preserve older parks with a large amount of tree coverage while respecting demands for particular built infrastructure. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Behaviour; Central Europe; Heat; Leipzig; Perception; Public health; Social survey; Urban green space","climate change; cooling; ecosystem service; environmental change; perception; questionnaire survey; summer; urban ecosystem; urban planning; urban population; Germany; Leipzig; Saxony",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102538148

TCs forming over the Bay of Bengal (BoB) region in October, November, and December have, in the past, intensified significantly at the time of landfall. The effects of climate change on TCs of different strengths and their characteristics such as track, intensity, precipitation, and convective available potential energy over the BoB region have not been well studied. This study explores the effects of climate change on two TCs of very severe cyclonic storm (VSCS) category (TC Vardah and TC Madi), and two other TCs of extremely severe cyclonic storm (ESCS) category (TC Hudhud and TC Phailin) formed over BoB, both in the short term (2035) and long term (2075). The high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model is used to simulate the TCs under current and future climate conditions. The simulated TC track and intensity in the current climate agree well with the observations. To explore the impacts of climate change on TCs, the mean climate change signal, computed from future projections of the Community Climate System Model (CCSM4) in different representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios, is added to current climate conditions by using the pseudo global warming method. Results show a climate change-related reduction in TC translation speed, deepening of TC core, increased maximum surface wind, and increased precipitation over land in future RCP (4.5, 6.0, and 8.5) scenarios. The TCs in future RCP scenarios are seen to be more intensified compared to current climate simulations. Results demonstrate that all VSCS and ESCS category TCs considered in this study are likely to further intensify to the next higher category level with respect to their current classification, particularly in the far future RCP 6.0 and in the far future RCP 8.5 scenarios. The cyclone damage potential index of TC Vardah, TC Hudhud, and TC Phailin is projected to increase in a future warming climate. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Bay of Bengal; Climate change; Pseudo global warming method; Representative concentration pathway; Tropical cyclone; Weather research and forecasting model","climate change; climate effect; global warming; monsoon; tropical cyclone; weather forecasting; Bay of Bengal; Indian Ocean",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099955238

A numerical algorithm was created to differentiate between natural energy peaks and outliers, so as to first apply a data cleaning. Then, a calculation of the impact in the energy baseline for the demand response computation was implemented, with improved precision, as related to other referenced methods and to the original data processing. For the demo pilot project implemented in the Technical University of Cluj‐Napoca block of buildings, without the energy baseline data cleaning, in some cases it was impossible to compute the established key performance indicators (peak power reduction, energy savings, cost savings, CO2 emissions reduction) or the resulted values were far much higher (>50%) and not realistic. Therefore, in real case business models, it is crucial to use outlier’s removal. In the past years, both companies and academic communities pulled their efforts in generating input that consist in new abstractions, interfaces, approaches for scalability, and crowdsourcing tech-niques.

The establishment of new botanic gardens in tropical regions highlights a need for weed risk assessment tools suitable for tropical ecosystems. The relevance of plant traits for invasion into tropical rainforests has not been well studied. 2. Working in and around four botanic gardens in Indonesia where 590 alien species have been planted, we estimated the effect of four plant traits, plus time since species introduction, on: (a) the naturalization probability and (b) abundance (density) of naturalized species in adjacent native tropical rainforests; and (c) the distance that naturalized alien plants have spread from the botanic gardens. 3. We found that specific leaf area (SLA) strongly differentiated 23 naturalized from 78 non-naturalized alien species (randomly selected from 577 non-naturalized species) in our study. These trends may indicate that aliens with high SLA, which had a higher probability of naturalization, benefit from at least two factors when establishing in tropical forests: high growth rates and occupation of forest gaps. Naturalized aliens had high SLA and tended to be short. However, plant height was not significantly related to species' naturalization probability when considered alongside other traits. 4. Alien species that were present in the gardens for over 30 years and those with small seeds also had higher probabilities of becoming naturalized, indicating that garden plants can invade the understorey of closed canopy tropical rainforests, especially when invading species are shade tolerant and have sufficient time to establish. 5. On average, alien species that were not animal dispersed spread 78 m further into the forests and were more likely to naturalize than animal-dispersed species. We did not detect relationships between the measured traits and estimated density of naturalized aliens in the adjacent forests. 6. Synthesis: Traits were able to differentiate alien species from botanic gardens that naturalized in native forest from those that did not; this is promising for developing trait-based risk assessment in the tropics. To limit the risk of invasion and spread into adjacent native forests, we suggest tropical botanic gardens avoid planting alien species with fast carbon capture strategies and those that are shade tolerant. © 2021 The Authors.

The new trend, as part of the adaptation for climate change, is a strategy of increasing the number of urban open spaces, and circular plan design could be a sustainable approach to urban development. This paper provides a historical overview of various examples of circular objects containing built structures and open spaces from the Neolithic to the present. The Built-Up Area (BUA) and Open Space (OS) relationships are shown histogramically for 36 objects arranged chronologically. The morphospace analysis was performed to determine any possible regularity in the relationships of parts of circular objects. For the purpose of this research, three variables were chosen. First, all selected historical examples of circular objects were divided into two main categories: objects with a total diameter smaller than 300 m and objects with a total diameter bigger than 300 m. Additionally, the selected circular objects were divided by their type of open space to better understand their spatial position. The largest number of analyzed objects belongs to the Parks–Gardens category, followed by settlements, and then earth works, sacral objects and circular buildings, with the smallest number of circular objects being in the category of allotments and plazas. The second variable was Jam area and % of Jam. The buildings are of different sizes up to several hundred m2, and the areas range up to several hundred ha. The total area to OS ratio ranges from 0% (for Large Serdab) to 100% (for multiple objects). There is a similar situation with the diameter ratios (total and “jam”). Additionally, the final variable was the historical position of the selected circular objects. Circular objects belong to all historical periods from the Neolithic to the present. The aim of this research was to explore the relationship between OS and BUA in various circular objects with different diameters of open spaces and find out if there was any regularity in this relationship. The morphospace analysis of this research indicates that there is no clear regularity in the relationship between the built-up area and the open space, but the aspects and research results shown here contribute to sustainability since the circular design approach could play a key role in future circular design processes. © 2021 by the authors.

The new edition of this leading textbook provides a state-of-the-art analysis of the EU's environmental policies. Comprising five parts, Environmental Policy in the EU covers the rapidly changing context in which EU environmental policies are made, the key actors who interact to co-produce them and the most salient dynamics of policy making, ranging from agenda setting and decision making, through to implementation and evaluation. Written by leading international experts, individual chapters examine how the EU is responding to a multitude of different challenges, including biodiversity loss, climate change, energy insecurity, and water and air pollution. They tease out the different ways in which the EU's policies on these topics co-evolve with national and international environmental policies. In this systematically updated fourth edition, a wider array of learning features are employed to ensure that readers fully understand how EU environmental policies have developed over the last 50 years and how they are currently adapting to the rapidly evolving challenges of the twenty-first century, including the COVID-19 pandemic. It is an essential resource for undergraduate and postgraduate students studying environmental policy and politics, climate change, environmental law and EU politics more broadly. © 2021 selection and editorial matter, Andrew Jordan and Viviane Gravey.

Both face similar conflicts typical of ecotourism, particularly related to the impacts of recreational fishing and marine wildlife tourism. A high diversity of incentives is found to be used, the combination of which promotes effectiveness in achieving conservation objectives and equity in governance. Highly evolved regulations have provided for depleted spangled emperor (Lethrinus nebulosus) stocks in NMP to stabilise and begin recovery, and pink snapper (Pagrus auratus) stocks in SBMP to recover from past depletions, though there are still concerns about recreational fishing impacts. The governance frameworks for marine wildlife tourism are considered extremely good practice. Some incentives need strengthening in both cases, particularly capacity for enforcement, penalties for deterrence and cross-jurisdictional coordination. In NMP there was also a need to promote transparency in making research and monitoring results available, and to address tensions with the recreational fishing sector by building linkages to provide for their specific representation, as part of a strategy to build trust and cooperation with this sector. Both case studies represent world-leading good practice in addressing proximal impacts from local activities, but in the longer-term the foundation species of both marine parks are critically threatened by the distal impacts of climate change.

However, CO2 emissions generated by ships would harm the regional environment. Thus, how to quantify the CO2 emissions brought by ships for the present stage and future is critical for Arctic environment governance. As shipping emissions are determined by economic, political, environmental and operational factors, little research has been done to estimate CO2 emission from a systematical way. This paper proposed a System Dynamics (SD) model that incorporates those comprehensive factors simultaneously for Arctic shipping CO2 emission projection. The Northern Sea Route (NSR) and the ships sail across NSR are selected for estimation. 12 scenarios with different fuel usage conditions and ship speeds have been set to investigate the trend of CO2 emissions. Results show that when under the BAU scenario, the overall shipping CO2 emission on the NSR by 2050 will be 5506149 tons, which is 1.76 times of the emission level in 2020. Switching to cleaner fuels (such as LNG) and slow steaming are effective ways of emission reduction based on the simulation results.

The mean ABL-FT exchange is well related to topography and sea-land distribution, manifesting as strong downward flux over the western/northwestern mountains, moderate exchange along the eastern coastline, and small upward flux over the NCP. Eight weather types are classified to analyze the synoptic influence on ABL-FT exchange. Strong exchanges exist under the types of “low pressure trough,” “cold front,” and “high pressure” (about 63% of total days), characterized by the downward spatial mean flux of 0.019–0.026 kg m−2 s−1 over the whole research domain. But over the plain area, upward transport is dominant with the air flux from 0.004 to 0.013 kg m−2 s−1 under the first two weather types (about 32% of total days), corresponding to PM2.5 fluxes estimated in the range 0.30–0.54 μg m−2 s−1. This indicates the NCP being an effective pollution source for long-range transport. We also find that weather types with large downward flux and straightforward winds can refresh the underneath ABL air in about 6 h, which explains the dispersion of air pollution. A typical pollution case illustrates convergence and uplift to the FT of the pollutants in the NCP and the possible influence on downstream air quality. © 2021. American Geophysical Union.

Here, we evaluated the 30-year impacts of tillage intensity and cropping system on surface soil bulk density, nutrient availability, dry aggregate size distribution, and water-stable aggregation. This study was established in 1980 in eastern Nebraska USA, and included six tillage treatments of varying intensity (no-till, ridge till, disk till, subsoil rip, chisel plow, moldboard plow) and four crop rotation treatments (continuous soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.]; soybean-corn [Zea mays L.]; corn-soybean, continuous corn) in a randomized block design with six replicates. Surface soils were sampled in 2011 and soil aggregate properties assessed, including occluded particulate organic matter (oPOM) in micro/macroaggregates (0.053–0.5 mm) and mega-aggregates (>2.0 mm). Because of significant treatment differences in bulk density, soil properties were converted to an equivalent soil mass (ESM) basis to more accurately assess management effects. After 30 years, only the main effects of tillage and crop rotation were significant for most measured soil properties. Surface soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks (ESM for ∼0−30 cm soil depth) decreased with tillage intensity, and stocks were higher when corn was included in the cropping system. Dry aggregate size distributions shifted towards smaller size classes as tillage intensity increased and whenever corn was included in the cropping system. As a result, aggregate mean weight diameter (mm) followed a similar trend. Soil stocks of water-stable mega-aggregates also decreased with increasing tillage intensity. In near-surface soils (0–7.5 cm), highly-erodible aggregate oPOM was highest in no-till soils and was more sensitive to tillage disturbance (56–69% loss) than mega-aggregate oPOM (5–35% loss). Even in no-till soils, highly-erodible aggregate oPOM concentrations decreased under continuous corn compared to rotated systems likely due to greater frequency of fertility management-related soil disturbances (i.e. fertilizer injection annually vs every two years). These results suggest that cropping systems that maximize plant carbon inputs can partially mitigate soil erosion risks due to long-term tillage, but that other crop management-related soil disturbances (i.e. method of fertilizer application) could limit the mitigating effect of cropping system. © 2021","Crop rotation; Highly-erodible aggregate; Mega-aggregate; Particulate organic matter; Tillage","Aggregates; Agricultural robots; Amino acids; Crops; Erosion; Fertilizers; Nitrogen fixation; Organic carbon; Rotation; Size distribution; Soils; Aggregate properties; Aggregate size distributions; Fertility management; Fertilizer applications; Nutrient availability; Particulate organic matters; Soybean [glycine max (l.) merr.]; Water-stable aggregations; Agricultural machinery; agricultural ecosystem; agrometeorology; crop rotation; fertilizer application; maize; rainfed agriculture; soil aggregate; soil organic matter; soybean; tillage; Nebraska; United States; Glycine max; Matthiola; Zea mays",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101679008

In a word, climate change has become a vital issue of general concern in the current society. In this study, the carbon emission data of Chinese provinces in 1999-2019 are collected and analyzed, so as to identify the carbon emission of direct consumption per 10,000 residents in each province (including each municipal city and autonomous region) and the entire nation based on population data. The Arc Geographic Information Science Engine (ArcGIS Engine) and C#.NET platform are employed to call the MATLAB neural network toolbox. A model is selected and embedded in the prediction system to develop the entire system. This study demonstrates that the carbon emissions per resident in Northern China are significantly higher than those in Southern China, with the rate of carbon emissions continuing to increase over time. Compared with other models, the Elman neural network has a higher carbon emission prediction accuracy, but with more minor errors. For instance, its accuracy and prediction performance are improved by 55.93% and 19.48%, respectively, compared with the Backpropagation Neural Network (BPNN). The prediction results show that China is expected to reach its peak carbon emission in around 2025-2030. The above results are acquired based on the concept of carbon emissions and neural network model theories, supported by GIS component technology and intelligent methods. The feasibility of BPNN, Radial Basis Function (RBF) and Elman neural network models for predicting residential carbon emissions is analyzed. This study also designs a comprehensive, integrated and extensible visual intelligent platform, which is easy to implement and stable in operation. The trend and characteristics of carbon emission changes from 2027 to 2032 are explored and predicted based on the data about direct carbon emissions of Chinese provincial residents from 1999 to 2019, purposed to provide a scientific basis for the control and planning of carbon emissions. © 2021 Hui Jin.

We investigated whether eCa enhanced water savings, thereby ameliorating the impact of drought on carbon and water relations in trees. We report leaf-level gas exchange and whole-plant and soil water relations during a short-term dry-down in two Eucalyptus species with contrasting drought tolerance. Plants had previously been established for 9 to 11 months in steady-state conditions of ambient atmospheric CO2 (aCa) and eCa, with half of each treatment group exposed to sustained drought for 5 to 7 months. The lower stomatal conductance under eCa did not lead to soil moisture savings during the dry-down due to the counteractive effect of increased whole-plant leaf area. Nonetheless, eCa-grown plants maintained higher photosynthetic rates and leaf water potentials, making them less stressed during the dry-down, despite being larger. These effects were more pronounced in the xeric species than the mesic species, and in previously water-stressed plants. Our findings indicate that eCa may enhance plant performance during drought despite a lack of soil water savings, especially in species with more conservative growth and water-use strategies. © 2021 The Authors New Phytologist © 2021 New Phytologist Foundation","biomass; CO2 enrichment; drought; dry-down; leaf gas exchange; physiology; plant hydraulic; water-savings","carbon dioxide; drought; gas exchange; performance assessment; soil moisture; soil water; stomatal conductance; tolerance; water relations; Eucalyptus; carbon dioxide; water; drought; Eucalyptus; photosynthesis; plant leaf; tree; Carbon Dioxide; Droughts; Eucalyptus; Photosynthesis; Plant Leaves; Trees; Water",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101458783

However, whether mycotoxins induce gene-specific epigenetic alterations associated with inducible downstream gene expression is unclear as are the underlying regulatory mechanisms. Here, we found that T-2 toxin and its deacetylated metabolites but not deoxynivalenol (DON) or other representative mycotoxins highly induced the expression of cytochrome P450 1A4 (CYP1A4) in both Leghorn male hepatoma (LMH) cells and chicken primary hepatocytes, and this effect was related to the regulation of both aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and DNA methylation. We used methylation-sensitive restriction enzyme digestion-qPCR (MSRE-qPCR) and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays and found that the binding of DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) to highly methylated CpG island 3-2 at the enhancer of CYP1A4 was accompanied by the recruitment of the repressive histone modification marker H3K27me3, inducing a silent state. In turn, T-2 toxin stimulation enriched the binding of AhR to demethylated CpG island 3-2, which facilitated p300 and H3K9ac recruitment and ultimately generated an activated chromatin structure at the enhancer by increasing the active histone modification markers, including H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and H3K14ac. Interestingly, T-2 toxin-induced AhR activation also facilitated RNA polymerase II binding to CpG island 2, which may form a transcriptionally active chromatin structure at the promoter and ultimately transactivate CYP1A4. Our findings provide novel insights into the epigenetic regulation of T-2 toxin-induced gene expression. © 2021 Federation of American Societies for Experimental Biology","AhR; chromatin remodeling; CYP1A4; DNA methylation; T-2 toxin","aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; bisulfite; DNA (cytosine 5) methyltransferase 1; genomic DNA; histone deacetylase 2; mycotoxin; RNA polymerase II; T 2 toxin; vomitoxin; aromatic hydrocarbon receptor; avian protein; CYP1A4 protein, Gallus gallus; T 2 toxin; unspecific monooxygenase; adult; animal cell; animal experiment; Article; cell culture; cell isolation; chromatin assembly and disassembly; chromatin immunoprecipitation; chromatin structure; controlled study; CpG island; cytochrome P450 1A4 gene; DNA methylation; enhancer region; gene; histone modification; immunoprecipitation; in vitro study; liver cell; liver cell carcinoma; LMH cell line; luciferase assay; male; nonhuman; priority journal; promoter region; real time polymerase chain reaction; restriction site; RNA isolation; animal; chicken; cytology; drug effect; gene expression regulation; genetic transcription; genetics; liver cell carcinoma; liver tumor; metabolism; pathology; Animals; Aryl Hydrocarbon Hydroxylases; Avian Proteins; Carcinoma, Hepatocellular; Chickens; Chromatin Assembly and Disassembly; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; Hepatocytes; Liver Neoplasms; Promoter Regions, Genetic; Receptors, Aryl Hydrocarbon; T-2 Toxin; Transcription, Genetic",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103745488

To enhance the energy performance of this sector, the use of reversible room air-conditioners (RRACs) for combined space heating and domestic hot water (DHW) production is proposed. The idea arises from the fact that in subtropical regions RRACs sized for cooling always have excessive heating capacities to allow a parallel production of DHW. In order to assess the techno-economic feasibility of the proposed initiative, a representative housing estate in Hong Kong consisting of 12,800 residential units was selected for an extensive simulation study. Results confirmed the technical viability of the proposed system. It was found that a wide adoption of the technology has the potential to reduce 7.7% of Hong Kong residential energy consumption and 744,192 t of CO2e emissions. The tolerable capital cost (TCC) approach was adopted for yearly economic viability analysis.

This study focused on the local emissions and long-distance input of PAHs in the urban atmosphere, which will contribute to the reduction of air pollution. PM2.5-bound and gas-phase concentrations of 16 atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were investigated during different seasons in Shanghai. The results showed that total concentration of 16 PAHs ranged from 3.19 to 22.26 ng m−3 and 6.13–53.97 ng m−3 in PM2.5 and gas phase, respectively. The seasonal variation is in the following orders: winter &gt; autumn &gt; spring &gt; summer for PM2.5-bound PAHs and winter &gt; summer &gt; autumn &gt; spring for gas-phase PAHs, respectively. The result of gas-particle partitioning between PM2.5 and gas phase indicated that PAHs were most easily adsorbed in particles in autumn. Concentrations of other major air pollutants (PM2.5, SO2, NO2, and CO) had a significant positive correlation with the PM2.5-phase PAHs suggesting both local and regional coal combustion emissions were one of the important sources. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was applied to identify the sources of atmospheric PAHs. It was found that the PM2.5-bound PAHs in Shanghai were mainly from coke and coal combustion (38.71%), traffic emission (23.55%) and biomass combustion (20.98%). However, the sources of gas-phase PAHs were biomass combustion/petroleum combustion and leakage (45.96%), natural gas combustion (29.98%), coke and coal combustion (24.06%). Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLT) showed that Shanghai was more susceptible to atmospheric pollutants from the north of China in spring and winter. The results of Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) and Concentration Weighted Trajectory (CWT) indicated that gas-phase PAHs in Shanghai were greatly affected by long-distance input, while the potential source area of PM2.5-bound PAHs mainly distributed in the local and surrounding industrial areas of Shanghai. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Atmospheric PAHs; Gas-PM2.5 partitioning; Long-distance input; Seasonal variation; Source apportionment","Air pollution; Coal; Coal combustion; Coke; Factorization; Gases; Industrial emissions; Mineral oils; Atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; Biomass combustion; Gas-phases; Gas-PM2.5 partitioning; Long-distance input; PM$-2.5$; Polycyclic aromatics; Seasonal variation; Source apportionment; Urban atmospheres; Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons; coal; coke; natural gas; nitrogen dioxide; petroleum; polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon; atmospheric pollution; biomass; concentration (composition); gas phase reaction; industrial emission; natural gas; particulate matter; pollutant source; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; air pollutant; air sampling; air temperature; airflow; Article; atmosphere; autumn; biomass; China; combustion; concentration (parameter); environmental impact; exhaust gas; gas analysis; industrial area; particulate matter 2.5; phase partitioning; photochemical smog; priority journal; seashore; seasonal variation; spring; summer; traffic; urban area; vapor pressure; winter; Yellow Sea; China; Shanghai",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102796697

Currently, lithium is in high demand in the international markets as a strategic resource for the green electromobility industry, which represents part of the Global North policies established by the Paris Agreement to mitigate climate change's effects. Using both documentary and ethnographic methods based mainly on semi-structured interviews conducted with Atacameño people, public officials, and lithium companies' representatives and workers, we propose a decolonial interpretation of lithium extractivism in brine mining through the lens of Latin American political ecology combined with a decolonial and water justice approach. The results demonstrate how the linkages and feedback between global and local dynamics of lithium mining in the Salar de Atacama constitute a form of green extractivism that further replicates the historical inequalities between the Northern and Southern hemispheres and especially affects the indigenous Andean territories and the water ecosystems in the Global South. We call this phenomenon the colonial shadow of green electromobility. We conclude by exposing the need to rethink global proposals addressing climate change by reducing the commodity demand and aiming for water justice at global and local levels. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Atacama communities; Brine; Decolonial political ecology; Green extractivism","brine; decolonization; indigenous population; lithium; political economy; sustainability; water resource; Antofagasta; Chile; Salar de Atacama Basin; Atacama",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103095511

The carbon retention of marine-plankton communities is as important as their primary production; however, data on the annual carbon retention of marine-plankton communities based on daily sample analysis are limited. Using our published and unpublished data, we calculated the one-year integrated carbon retention of a marine-plankton community at an innermost fixed station in the highly eutrophic Masan Bay, Korea, collected daily from June 2004 to May 2005. The total one-year integrated carbon retention of all plankton taxa in the study period was 471 g C m−3 yr−1. The integrated carbon retentions by phytoplankton, heterotrophic protists, and heterotrophic bacteria were 344, 76, and 40 g C m−3 yr−1, respectively, whereas those by photosynthetic ciliates and metazooplankton were 9 and 2 g C m−3 yr−1, respectively. Among the plankton subgroups, the integrated carbon retention by the phototrophic dinoflagellates (109 g C m−3 yr−1) was highest, followed by raphidophytes (88), cryptophytes (73), diatoms (43), heterotrophic bacteria (40), and heterotrophic dinoflagellates (39). The total duration of the red tides by diatoms that grow using only photosynthesis (42 days), was considerably shorter than that of phototrophic dinoflagellates, raphidophytes, or cryptophytes, which can grow mixotrophically (56–135 days). The shorter duration of red tides by diatoms was primarily responsible for their lower carbon retention, although the maximum growth rates of the diatoms were considerably higher than those of the flagellates. The percentage of the 1-year integrated carbon retention of the heterotrophic protists relative to that of the phytoplankton was approximately 20%, similar to the mean-gross-growth efficiency of heterotrophic-protist grazers on phytoplankton, indicating a good balance between these two components in the planktonic food web. This study reported one-year integrated carbon retention of marine plankton at the species level, calculated based on daily samples, and thus gave an insight into which, and to what extent, species and groups contribute to the total carbon retention of plankton for one year in a highly eutrophic bay. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Carbon dioxide; Diatom; Dinoflagellate; Harmful algal bloom; Mixotroph; Protist; Red tide","biomass; carbon cycle; dinoflagellate cyst; growth; marine ecosystem; marine environment; measurement method; net primary production; phytoplankton; primary production; red tide; spatiotemporal analysis; Korea; Masan Bay; South Korea; South Kyongsang; Bacillariophyta; Ciliophora; Cryptophyta; Dinophyceae; Mastigophora (flagellates); Protista; Raphidophyceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104745279

We compared the CO2RR selectivity of Cu catalysts subjected to either potentiostatic conditions (fixed applied potential of -0.7 VRHE) or pulsed electrolysis conditions (1 s pulses at oxidative potentials ranging from Ean = 0.6 to 1.5 VRHE, followed by 1 s pulses at -0.7 VRHE) and identified the main parameters responsible for the enhanced product selectivity observed in the latter case. Herein, two distinct regimes were observed: (i) for Ean = 0.9 VRHE we obtained 10% enhanced C2 product selectivity (FEC2H4 = 43.6% and FEC2H5OH = 19.8%) in comparison to the potentiostatic CO2RR at -0.7 VRHE (FEC2H4 = 40.9% and FEC2H5OH = 11%), (ii) while for Ean = 1.2 VRHE, high CH4 selectivity (FECH4 = 48.3% vs 0.1% at constant -0.7 VRHE) was observed. Operando spectroscopy (XAS, SERS) and ex situ microscopy (SEM and TEM) measurements revealed that these differences in catalyst selectivity can be ascribed to structural modifications and local pH effects. The morphological reconstruction of the catalyst observed after pulsed electrolysis with Ean = 0.9 VRHE, including the presence of highly defective interfaces and grain boundaries, was found to play a key role in the enhancement of the C2 product formation. In turn, pulsed electrolysis with Ean = 1.2 VRHE caused the consumption of OH- species near the catalyst surface, leading to an OH-poor environment favorable for CH4 production. © 2021 The Authors.

This has included a call for historical research that particularizes adaptation in specific locations. This paper responds to this call by using newspaper archives to construct a history of wildfires in County Donegal, Ireland. This study goes beyond existing research that particularizes adaptation, by using this history as a lens through which to evaluate current adaptation policy. In doing so it uncovers problematic mismatches between the experience of local communities living with wildfire hazards and current climate change adaptation policies. National adaptation policy in Ireland presents uncontrolled wildfires as a largely new and unfamiliar hazard that requires innovative management approaches. However, newspaper archives reveal that local communities have adopted a variety of adaptive practices for wildfire hazards for over a century, and that these practices have coevolved with shifting economic, social, political, and cultural contexts. This paper also introduces the concept of non-predominant hazards, that is hazards that are often overlooked, forgotten, or neglected. Historical research on non-predominant hazards can play an important role in making visible trajectories of adaptation for such hazards. This study also points towards how deeper particularization studies that examine the long-term usage of specific adaptation practices can also be used to test the effectiveness of these practices through time, and to offer lessons for contemporary adaptation. These results have implications for disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation to non-predominant hazards in a variety of contexts. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Adaptation; Climate; Hazards; History; Ireland; Wildfires",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103706738

Using parametric modelling, 75 urban contexts were generated for three simulation models characterized as high-rise residential buildings located in an urban tropical climate. In order to optimize solar access in terms of daylight and annual energy savings, this study quantified the shading effects of the urban context, on annual cooling energy, annual daytime lighting energy and spatial daylight autonomy (sDA) for the simulation models. In this study, the optimum solar access is defined for a perimeter zone in a high-rise residential building, achieving 75 sDA (300lx|50) with corresponding annual energy savings of 28%-36% in the east–west and 8%-12% in the north–south directions. As the optimum solar access is difficult to calculate at the early design stage, building setback curves were developed. The prescribed building setbacks were validated with three calibrated case studies. All case studies met 50% of interior spaces (living rooms and bedrooms) with 55 sDA (300lx|50) and annual energy savings of 26%-31% in east–west and 9%-15% in north–south directions.

The estimation of TSM is performed using Landsat-8/operational land imager (OLI), and an intercomparison of TSM load during the pre-lockdown and lockdown periods is done. It is observed that during the lockdown period, TSM reduced by 30–50%. This is a significant observation considering the ecological balance of the region and the fact that it is home to the largest mangroves in the world. This change in suspended matter presumably reflects the influence of reduction in anthropogenic activities owing to the COVID-19 lockdowns, such as industries, closure of shipping activities (through less dredging), and brick kilns (through less sediment removal), which are generally the primary contributors in this region. Even though these observed changes are representative of the positive influence of the COVID-19 lockdown, its implications in estuarine biogeochemistry still remain poorly quantified. The decrease in TSM content may increase light penetration, thereby increasing the primary productivity. In addition, low sediment load reaching the Bay of Bengal could influence the carbon export due to reduction in ballasting effect as reported from this region. In summary, the influence of the COVID-19 lockdown on the biogeochemistry of the aquatic ecosystem appears rather complex than thought earlier and may vary regionally based on local hydrodynamics. The analysis elucidates the complex interplay of regional lockdown and its implication in modulation of local biogeochemistry. However, the relative importance of each process in the Hooghly estuary remains to be fully evaluated. © Copyright © 2021 Jayaram, Roy, Chacko, Swain, Punnana, Bandyopadhyay, Choudhury and Dutta.","COVID-19 lockdown; Hooghly estuary; remote sensing; total suspended matter concentration; water quality",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107202294

It has been accepted by all Governments and experts that even a 1.5°C-2°C rise in atmospheric temperature will be playing a havoc on our planet. The near unanimity of all countries, which matter, led to the historic Paris agreement for reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases' emission levels. Efforts by all stakeholders were on to control and contain the disruptive effects of climate change. Amidst these efforts, yet another disruptor, the ongoing pandemic of coronavirus, COVID-19 struck. We are grappling with its ferocity since January 2020. Most countries have imposed restrictions on the movement of personnel and goods to contain the disease and to stop its spread to new areas. This has led to a large-scale suspension of industrial activities across sectors. Most severely hit are persons and organizations associated with transportation, tourism, and hospitality. Trade and commerce have also been adversely affected by the disruption of supply chains. The industrial production is down and a fall in GDPs more severe than the one caused by the recession of 2008 is feared. In a nutshell, the entire mankind is under economic and social stress due to the suspension of various human activities in its fight against the pandemic. But this suspension of activities has seen some pleasing returns too in the form of cleaner air in most cities across continents. A natural question that comes to one's mind is as to how would the effect of these two disruptors, the ongoing pandemic and man's fight against climate change, affect each other. In this chapter, the short-term and long-term effects of these disruptors are identified, the factors influencing the efforts by various stakeholders are discussed, and pitfalls that may come in the path are highlighted by looking at the similarities and differences in the two disruptors. Finally, a road map for the planners in the light of these discussions is suggested. © 2021 River Publishers. All rights reserved.",,,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85119029476

However, policies that curtail emissions in one region might increase emissions in another through the transfer of emission-intensive production across borders. Such spillover of emissions, mostly via international trade, can cause what is referred to as “carbon leakage.” This primer first provides an overview of the underlying mechanisms, empirical evaluation, and future projections of carbon leakage. It then illustrates potential anti-leakage policies, including free allocation of emission permits and border carbon adjustment. Well-designed anti-leakage policies that create economic and environmental benefits and ensure fairness and justice are clearly required.

Food system interventions and policies give rise to synergies and trade-offs that emerge over time due to the dynamic nature and interconnections of system elements. Analysis of an entire food system is necessary to identify synergies that bring simultaneous benefits and mitigate trade-offs, both short- and long-term. OBJECTIVE: Our study aims to inform the sustainable transformation of food systems by identifying short- and long-term synergies and trade-offs in the climate-smart village (CSV) Lawra-Jirapa in northern Ghana under the current practices, technologies, policies, and trends of population growth, extreme events, and climate change impacts. METHODS: We develop a system dynamics model to simulate the food system in the CSV between 2011 and 2060. We apply the climate-smart agriculture (CSA) approach as a diagnostic tool to the CSV system to reveal the short- and long-term trade-offs and synergies between the CSA goals. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The simulation results reveal short-term progress towards the goal of increased productivity and income, with trade-offs in the goals of GHG removal, climate adaptation, and resilience. In the long term, post-2035, current agriculture practices, technologies, and policies inside and outside the CSV boundaries result in trade-offs across all three CSA goals, and progress made towards these goals is reversed. The CSV system behaviour, thus, exhibits a “better before worse” pattern. SIGNIFICANCE: The analysis demonstrates an approach, which considers simultaneously all three CSA goals, to identify synergies and mitigate trade-offs in an entire food system. The findings suggest that understanding the dynamics of food systems is a precursor to their sustainable transformation. This transformation will entail changes to the food system's goals and structure with equal attention to short- and long-term outcomes. © 2021 The Author(s)","Climate change; Food security; Smallholder agriculture; System dynamics modelling; Systems thinking; West Africa","adaptive management; agricultural production; alternative agriculture; climate change; trade-off; Ghana",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104350240

However, evaluations of adaptation often adopt an aggregated perspective, while disaggregation of results is important to learn about who benefits when and where. A typical example is adaptation of rice agriculture in the Vietnam Mekong Delta (VMD). Efforts focused on flood protection have mainly benefitted large-scale farmers while harming small-scale farmers. To investigate the distributional consequences of adaptation policies in the VMD, we assess both aggregate total output and equity indicators, as well as disaggregated impacts in terms of district-level farming profitability. Doing so requires an adequate representation of the multisectoral dynamics between the human and biophysical systems which influence farming profitability. We develop a spatially explicit integrated assessment model that couples inundation, sedimentation, soil fertility and nutrient dynamics, and behavioral land-use change and farming profitability calculation. We find that inter-district inequality responds in a non-linear way to climatic and socio-economic changes and choices of adaptation policies. The patterns of who wins and who loses could change substantially when a different policy is implemented or if a slightly different uncertain future materializes. We also find that there is no simple ranking of alternative adaptation policies, so one should make trade-offs based on agreed preferences. Accounting for equity implies exploring the distribution of outcomes over different groups over a range of uncertain futures. Only by accounting for multisectoral dynamics can planners anticipate the equity consequences of adaptation and prepare additional measures to aid the worse-off actors. © 2021. The Authors.

Wilczek) is mostly grown in the tropical and sub-tropical regions of the world. Except for the low temperature, most of the environmental stresses still prevail in these regions. Drought is a problem in rainfed agriculture, and mungbean is mostly grown under such conditions. In contrast, the summer rains or occasional heavy rains create anoxia/hypoxia for mungbean. Another environmental concern is the increase in salinity in mungbean growing areas at an increasing rate. The responses of mungbean to the aforementioned abiotic stresses are well documented. Drought-affected plants showed relatively longer roots but decreased plant height, while plants under anoxia/hypoxia had smaller roots but higher plant height. The formation of adventitious roots in waterlogged plants is an adaptive mechanism of anoxia/hypoxia tolerance in mungbean, which resulted in better shoot growth, and eventually, increased yield. Salinity causes water stress in plants where tolerant genotypes combat by maintaining higher plant water and K+/Na+ ratio than the salt susceptible ones. The mungbean genotypes tested so far exhibited a wide range of variation in morpho-physiological characteristics under abiotic stresses. However, some common mechanisms are adopted by the plants to adapt to those stresses. For instance, plant water status, CO2 fixation, and nutrient balance are disturbed by the abiotic stresses. Therefore, tolerant genotypes maintain better water status and balanced plant nutrients as well as fix more CO2 than that by the susceptible ones. Although the stress tolerance mechanisms of mungbean are well understood, not much progress has been achieved in developing a stress-tolerant variety. It is because stress tolerance is mostly related to multiple genes instead of a single gene. Hence, screening of tolerant genotypes against abiotic stresses has remained the most practical way of increasing mungbean production under such conditions. Considering recent advances in the understanding of eco-physiology of stress tolerance in mungbean, physiological approaches are becoming more feasible for the genetic enhancement of crops under abiotic stresses. We developed several screening techniques and identified some traits of interest. Identification of quantitative trait loci (QTL) for incorporating these traits can prompt tolerance of plants to the abiotic stresses. Besides, some promising management strategies like the additional fertilizer may improve the growth and yield of mungbean. These may be valuable practices for the mungbean growing areas suffering from various abiotic stresses. Additionally, exogenously applied cytokinin (CK) and gibberellic (GA) in stressed plants improved growth, gas exchange, and biochemical attributes and produced a stable yield compared to non-stressed plants. Finally, well-integrated genetic and agronomic management options have to be implemented for increasing mungbean productivity under abiotic stress conditions across the globe. © 2021 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Total RNA was extracted from three soil samples from a mangrove affected by sewage for the construction of the cDNA library, and sequencing by the Illumina HiSeq 4000 platform. We found a domain of the phylum Firmicutes and Proteobacteria, represented mainly by Bacillus and Desulfuromonas respectively. Functional annotation showed high gene expression in metabolic pathways related to carbohydrate metabolism and processing of genetic information. Regarding biogeochemical cycles, the highest transcriptional activity was found in the assimilation of formaldehyde (methane metabolism), dissimilatory nitrate reduction (nitrogen metabolism), and reduction of sulfate (sulfur metabolism), which indicates a predominance of anaerobic processes and, decomposition of organic matter. Benzoate degradation was the pathway with the highest transcriptional activity in the degradation of xenobiotics. The predominance of few taxonomics could indicate selection of taxonomic groups by wastewater, advanced ecosystem degradation and loss of ecosystem resilience future. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biogeochemical cycles; Mangrove; Metatranscriptome; Rhizospheric soil; Xenobiotic metabolism",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102512620

Although the prognosis for localized prostate cancer is good, no curative treatments are available for metastatic disease. Better diagnostic methods could help target therapies and improve the outcome. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is a transmembrane glycoprotein that is overexpressed on malignant prostate tumor cells and correlates with the aggressiveness of the disease. PSMA is a clinically validated target for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging-based diagnostics in prostate cancer, and during recent years several therapeutics have been developed based on PSMA expression and activity. The expression of PSMA in prostate cancer can be very heterogeneous and some metastases are negative for PSMA. Determinants that dictate clinical responses to PSMA-targeting therapeutics are not well known. Moreover, it is not clear how to manipulate PSMA expression for therapeutic purposes and develop rational treatment combinations. A deeper understanding of the biology behind the use of PSMA would help the development of theranostics with radiolabeled compounds and other PSMA-based therapeutic approaches. Along with PSMA several other targets have also been evaluated or are currently under investigation in preclinical or clinical settings in prostate cancer. Here we critically elaborate the biology and scientific rationale behind the use of PSMA and other targets in the detection and therapeutic targeting of metastatic prostate cancer. © 2021 by the authors.

The method applies specifically to urban areas at which the quality of blue-green infrastructure (BGI) is of fundamental importance in reducing the climate change consequences. Effective transversal connectivity among the BGI at the metropolitan scale supplies various ecosystem services in support of nature-based solutions for emerging urban challenges. The TCI value is computed (determined) by integrating a variety of existing and novel landscape indicators into an equation. The connectivity indicators belong to two categories: the intra-patch consists of the isoperimetric quotient, and patch ecological indicator, and the inter-patch ones listed as the band level, the shared border ratio, and the transport fragmentation buffer. The method is tested on the metropolitan zone of Berlin, and the results reveal unconventional findings of the effectiveness of BGI in urbanized landscapes.

The present study depicts the annual and decadal fluctuations in Indian mackerel fishery along Kerala coast of southeastern Arabian Sea over a time period of 31 years (1985–2016), its relationship between four major oceanographic variables (SST, Pr, SSS and SSC) and future predictions under two Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs). Coast specific changes of these oceanographic variables since 1960 provide a baseline status of the existing climatic conditions of the marine ecosystem of the SEAS whereas, the RCP projections till 2100 provide an insight to the future conditions. Generalized Additive Models (GAMs) has been used to comprehend the relation among the Weighted CPUE (cpue) and Relative effort (Effort) of Indian mackerel and the four major oceanographic variables. The GAM model could explain 68.9 % and 71.1 % deviance of cpue and Effort respectively. The significance of the most influential oceanographic variables on the cpue of Indian mackerel were in the order SST > Pr > SSC > SSS and for Effort were in the order Pr > SST > SSS > SSC. The projected cpue and Effort of Indian mackerel exhibits varying trends under the RCP 4.5 and RCP 6.0 scenarios. The future catch potential of Indian mackerel predicted under both RCP scenarios for the period 2020–2100 also show reduction, with the latter exhibiting a more drastic reduction. The study implies that for sustainable long-term fishery and to reduce the impact of climate change on Indian mackerel, the fishing pressure has to be maintained at low and healthy level. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Climate change; CPUE; Generalized Additive Model; Indian mackerel; Kerala coast; RCP scenarios",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107658048

Electrocatalytic activity, selectivity, reaction kinetics, and stability are critical factors for the development of electrochemical CO2 reduction technology. While the activity and selectivity of various electrocatalysts have been reported in a number of publications, the understanding of kinetic issues of mass and charge transport from a perspective of materials science and engineering is lacking. This work covers the critical role of the triple-phase boundary of CO2, protons, and electrons in CO2 conversion. Proton and electron conduction in electrocatalysts are discussed as composite materials and single-phase materials, respectively. Relatively established composite proton- and electron-conducting electrocatalysts (PECEs) are reviewed from state-of-the-art research, and suggestions are given for further potential improvement. In contrast, as the development of single-phase PECEs for electrochemical CO2 reduction is still nascent, perspectives for future development are proposed. Metal-organic framework materials are suggested and discussed as one of the ideal material candidates for single-phase PECEs with strategies to increase proton and electron conductivity. © 2021","clean energy technology; CO2 reduction; electrocatalysts; metal-organic frameworks (MOFs); mixed ionic and electronic conductors (MIECs)","Electrocatalysts; Electrolysis; Electrons; Industrial chemicals; Metal-Organic Frameworks; Organometallics; Reaction kinetics; Reduction; Electrocatalytic activity; Electrochemical conversion; Electron conductivity; Industrial processs; Materials science and engineering; Metal organic framework materials; Single-phase materials; Triple phase boundary; Carbon dioxide",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104993903

Weather and atmospheric conditions created a favorable environment to transport the plume through the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, Maryland, metro areas in the afternoon and concentrate smoke near the surface, degrading air quality for several hours. ABI AOD with 5-min temporal resolution and 2-km spatial resolution definitively identified the timing and geographic extent of the plume during daylight hours. Comparison to AERONET AOD indicates that ABI AOD captured the relative change in AOD due to passage of the smoke, with a mean absolute error of 0.047. Ground-based measurements of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) confirm deteriorations in air quality coincident with the progression of the smoke. Ceilometer aerosol backscatter profiles verify plume transport timing and indicate that smoke aerosols were well mixed in a shallow boundary layer. This event illustrates the advantages of using multiple datasets to analyze the impacts of aerosols on ambient air quality. Given the quickly evolving nature of the event over several hours, ABI AOD provided information for the public and decision-makers that was not available from any other source, including polar-orbiting satellite sensors. This study suggests that PM2.5 concentrations estimated from ABI AOD can be used to fill in the gaps in nationwide regulatory PM2.5 monitor networks and may be a valuable addition to EPA’s PM2.5 NowCast of current air quality conditions. © 2021 American Meteorological Society.","Aerosols/particulates; Air quality; Biomass burning; Satellite observations; Surface observations","Air quality; Atmospheric aerosols; Atmospheric movements; Boundary layers; Decision making; Meteorological instruments; Optical properties; Orbits; Advanced Baseline Imager; Aerosol optical depths; Aerosol particulates; Biomass-burning; PM 2.5; Prescribed fires; Satellite observations; Smoke plume; Surface observation; Temporally resolved; Smoke; Varanidae; Virginia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85116038905

The China's Clean Air Action has been implemented to reduce anthropogenic NOx emissions since 2013. To examine if atmospheric NO3− deposition would decrease and its sources had changed as a result of this regulation, we collected the precipitation samples (n = 181) on a daily basis at a rural forested site in Northeast China from April 2014 to December 2017 and measured the concentrations and δ15N values of NO3−. We found annual NO3− deposition ranged from 6.5 to 7.3 kg N ha−1 yr−1 and gradually declined since 2015. The δ15N–NO3- spanned a large range from −17.4 to 13.1‰ with a mass-weighted mean of −3.5‰ during the study period. The δ15N–NO3- was higher by 10‰ in winter (3.3 ± 4.2‰) than in summer (−7.4 ± 3.9‰), which was driven by the changes of both coal combustion and soil emission. Over the study period, NOx from coal combustion, vehicle exhaust, biomass burning and soil emission contributed 28.2 ± 11.9%, 28.8 ± 16.3%, 26.9 ± 14.7%, and 16.1 ± 7.2% to precipitation NO3−, respectively.

Both OC and EC originate from a variety of emission sources. Radiocarbon (14C) analysis can be used to apportion bulk aerosol, OC, and EC into their sources. However, such analyses require the physical separation of OC and EC. Here, we apply of ECT9 protocol to physically isolate OC and EC for 14C analysis and evaluate its effectiveness. Several reference materials are selected, including two pure OC (fossil ""adipic acid""and contemporary ""sucrose""), two pure EC (fossil ""regal black""and ""C1150""), and three complex materials containing contemporary and/or fossil OC and EC (""rice char"", NIST urban dust standards ""SRM1649a""and ""SRM8785"", i.e., fine fraction of resuspended SRM1649a on filters). The pure materials were measured for their OC, EC, and total carbon (TC) mass fractions and corresponding carbon isotopes to evaluate the uncertainty of the procedure. The average accuracy of TC mass, determined via volumetric injection of a sucrose solution, was approximately 5 %. Ratios of EC/TC and OC/TC were highly reproducible, with analytical precisions better than 2 % for all reference materials, ranging in size from 20 to 100 μg C. Consensus values were reached for all pure reference materials for both d13C and fraction modern (F14C), with an uncertainty of < 0.3 ‰ and approximately 5 %, respectively. The procedure introduced 1.3 ± 0.6 μg of extraneous carbon, an amount compatible to that of the Swiss_4S protocol. In addition, OC and EC were isolated from mixtures of pure contemporary OC (sucrose) with pure fossil EC (regal black) and fossil OC (adipic acid) with contemporary EC (rice char EC) to evaluate the effectiveness of OC and EC separation. Consensus F14C values were reached for all OC (g 5-30 μg) and EC (m 10-60 μg) fractions with an uncertainty of m 5 % on average. We found that the ECT9 protocol efficiently isolates OC or EC from complex mixtures. Based on d13C measurements, the average contribution of charred OC to EC is likely less than 3 % when the OC loading amount is less than 30 μg C. Charring was further assessed by evaluating thermograms of various materials, including aerosol samples collected in the Arctic and from tailpipes of gasoline or diesel engines. These data demonstrate that the ECT9 method effectively removes pyrolyzed OC. Thus, the ECT9 protocol, initially developed for concentration and stable isotope measurements of OC and EC, is suitable for 14C-based apportionment studies, including μgC-sized samples from arctic environments. © Author(s) 2021.

The microscopic characteristics of fluid states in nanopores of shale composites during gas production are key to the enhancement of shale gas recovery, which remain unexplored. Here we conduct a microscopic modeling for shale nanocomposite, which realizes separate force field parameterization and controllable pore network optimization. A shale clay-kerogen nanocomposite with heterogeneous pore structure is thereafter built to investigate the dynamic characteristics of fluid states during pressure depletion and CO2 sequestration using molecular simulations for the first time. In this study, the different gas recovery mechanisms for pressure depletion and CO2 sequestration are revealed: pressure depletion mainly produces CH4 free state, while CO2 injection predominately extracts CH4 dissolved state. We propose CH4 adsorbed state as the potential target for enhanced shale gas recovery in the late production stage due to its minimal recovery. Three distribution forms of water molecules and two developing trends of water clusters are distinguished in the nanocomposite. Increasing water content can reduce the CH4 recovery during pressure depletion, but improve the CH4 recovery during CO2 injection. We suggest low water content may optimize the shale gas recovery efficiency. The deformation of the kerogen structure is observed to enhance the gas solubility in the kerogen matrix. In the CO2 injection stage, multi-components can promote the recovery of the CH4 adsorbed state. In a broader perspective, the microscopic modeling is widely applicable to other natural and synthetic organic-inorganic nanocomposites interacting with fluids. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","CO2 sequestration; Fluid state; Molecular dynamics; Nanocomposite; Shale gas recovery","Carbon dioxide; Gases; Kerogen; Molecules; Nanocomposites; Oil shale; Plastic flow; Pore structure; Recovery; Shale gas; Dynamic characteristics; Force field parameterization; Microscopic characteristics; Microscopic modeling; Molecular simulations; Organic-inorganic composite; Organic-inorganic nanocomposites; Pressure depletion; Gas industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099610731

Alcohols have been generally considered to be a potential clean fuel to reduce soot emissions. At present, alcohol fuels represented by methanol, ethanol, butanol and pentanol have been extensively studied and have made remarkable progress. Therefore, this article is written as a broad overview of the subject. The effects of methanol, ethanol, butanol and pentanol additions on the formations of soot and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were systematically summarized from the two aspects of the internal combustion engine bench and the fundamental combustion system. These studies have shown a decreasing or synergistic effect of alcohols addition on soot formation and initially revealed the mechanism of soot formation.

In the field of photocatalysis, a 2D material with an appropriate bandgap of 1.3 to 2.0 eV is desirable. Herein, a new kind of fibrous phase red phosphorene with a bandgap between 1.43 to 1.54 eV is obtained. This is much better than black phosphorus because the bandgap of black P depends of its layer number. The black P needs to be as thin as 1-2 layers for suitable band diagram, which is difficult to control. The fibrous red phosphorene is first used for photocatalytic CO2 reduction, and its activity is superior to the majority of mainstream photocatalysts and reaches a record-high value among phosphorus. Besides, its activity in hydrogen evolution is higher than most of the phosphorus photocatalysts. The intralayer charge transfer is much easier than interlayer transfer. The mobility of electron and hole along the phosphorene plane is about 20 times higher than that perpendicular to different layers. The activity sites is at region between the two P[21] chains. These regions are easy to be exposed for fibrous phase phosphorene, making it to exhibit high activity. © 2021 Wiley-VCH GmbH","fibrous phase; hydrogen evolution; phosphorene; phosphorus; photocatalyst","Black Phosphorus; Carbon dioxide; Charge transfer; Energy gap; Hole mobility; Hydrogen; Phosphorus; Pollution control; Band diagrams; Carbon dioxide reduction; CO2 reduction; Different layers; High activity; Hydrogen evolution; Material science; Photo-catalytic; Photocatalytic activity",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103411669

In this study, we use multisensors (including the spaceborne MODIS, OCO-2, AIRS, and OMPS instruments as well as surface instruments) and multimodels (including WRF-Chem and WRF-CO2) to investigate a severe air pollution event on December 9, 2016 over eastern China. During this episode, a strong cold front moved southward. At the leading edge of the front, WRF-CO2 simulates an enhanced XCO2 belt while WRF-Chem simulates a belt of high PM2.5 concentration. The XCO2 and PM2.5 belts are generally colocated, due to coemission of CO2 and pollutants (or their precursors). Satellite observations including MODIS AOD, OCO-2 XCO2, OMPS NO2, AIRS CO, and surface data confirm the simulated pollution and XCO2 belts. Later on, the front became distorted due to terrain blocking and mountain channel flows. Both observations and simulations show that the channel winds between Mountains Dabie and Huang transport the haze plume into Jiangxi province, enhancing pollution in the region. It is concluded that the multisensor (including space-based and ground-based instruments) and multimodel (e.g., WRF-CO2, WRF-Chem) approach can be used to collectively monitor and investigate air pollution events, given that emissions of the involved species have generally similar spatial distributions. © 2021.

These action plans establish targets and timelines for pollution reduction, taking aim at high-polluting sectors and articulating strategies for controlling emissions. In this perspective, we demonstrate the need for transparent, accurate methods and data appraising the financial expenditures and investments required to fund these plans. Applying a unique dataset on project-specific abatement costs derived from official but largely non-public Chinese data sources, we calculate the cost of China's pollution clean-up to be $1.1 trillion USD. Given slowing economic growth, we assess a roughly $900 billion USD shortfall based on analysis of existing public environmental expenditure and local government investment, necessitating private sector funds and new finance mechanisms if the plans' benefits are to be fully realized. To spur these new approaches, we argue that additional data disclosure and transparency regarding cost calculations are needed. We identify key questions and next steps for further research and policy discussion on what data are needed to underpin these improved estimates of China's pollution clean-up costs. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; China's environment; Data; Financing pollution clean-up; Information transparency; Soil pollution; Water pollution",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100042488

However, the extent of this effect requires further investigation. This study was designed to investigate the relationship between long-term exposure to air pollution and the case fatality rate (CFR) of patients with COVID-19. The data on air quality index (AQI), PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, and O3 from 14 major cities in China in the past 5 years (2015–2020) were collected, and the CRF of COVID-19 patients in these cities was calculated. First, we investigated the correlation between CFR and long-term air quality indicators. Second, we examined the air pollutants affecting CFR and evaluated their predictive values. We found a positive correlation between the CFR and AQI (1, 3, and 5 years), PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years), and PM10 (1, 3, and 5 years). Further analysis indicated the more significant correlation for both AQI (3 and 5 years) and PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years) with CFR, and moderate predictive values for air pollution indicators such as AQI (1, 3, and 5 years) and PM2.5 (1, 3, and 5 years) for CFR. Our results indicate that long-term exposure to severe air pollution is associated with higher CFR of COVID-19 patients.

The study covers two consecutive vegetation periods. We investigated (i) the changes in plant growth, (ii) soil water and temperature at different depths, (iii) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (CO2 and N2 O) after biochar application, and (iv) the soil water, chemistry, and plant interactions. We used discrete measurements for plant growth, biomass production, and soil chemistry, while continuously monitoring the soil water content and temperature, and the state of plant health (i.e., using spectral reflectance sensors). Plant response in the control plot showed higher values of normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI; 0.3%) and lower values for photochemical reflectance index (PRI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) by 26.8% and 2.24%, respectively, than for biochar treatments. We found significant negative correlations between fAPAR and soil water contents (SWC), and NDVI and SWC values (−0.59 &lt; r &lt; −0.30; p &lt; 0.05). Soil temperature at the depth of 15 cm influenced soil CO2 emissions to a larger extent (r &gt; 0.5; p &lt; 0.01) than air temperature (0.21 &lt; r &lt; 0.33) or soil water content (r &lt; 0.06; p &gt; 0.05). Our data showed strong connections between GHG production and soil chemical parameters of soil pH, nitrogen, potassium, or phosphate concentrations. Biochar application increased soil CO2 emissions but reduced N2 O emissions. Our results demonstrated that biochar amendment to soils can help plant growth initially, but might not result in enhanced crop yield. The plant parameters were substantially different between the investigated years for both control and biochar amended parcels; therefore, long-term studies are essential to document the lasting effects of these treatments. © 2021 by the authors.

The mobile depots offer the possibility of keeping the task vehicles operational by supplying them en route with certain resources. For example, in two-echelon distribution systems, small task vehicles are used to navigate narrow streets and to deliver/collect goods or to collect waste, and larger vehicles serve as mobile depots to replenish the goods to be delivered or to receive collected goods or waste at the outskirts of the urban area. Accessibility constraints may also be imposed by regulations on emissions, which make some areas only accessible for environmentally friendly vehicles such as, for example, battery-powered electric vehicles. Especially if the respective refueling infrastructure is sparse, mobile refueling stations seem to be an interesting alternative. In this paper, we introduce the vehicle-routing problem with time windows and mobile depots (VRPTWMD) to capture the routing decisions of the described applications in a generalized fashion. The VRPTWMD is characterized by fleets of task vehicles (TVs) and support vehicles (SVs). The SVs may serve as mobile depots to restore either the load or the fuel capacity of the TVs that are used to fulfill the customer requests. We present a mixed-integer program for the VRPTWMD with which small instances can be solved using a commercial solver. Moreover, we develop a high-quality hybrid heuristic composed of an adaptive large neighborhood search and a path relinking approach to provide solutions on larger problem instances. We use a newly generated set of large VRPTWMD instances to analyze the effect of different problem characteristics on the structure of the identified solutions. In addition, our approach shows very convincing performance on benchmark instances for the related two-echelon multiple-trip VRP with satellite synchronization, which can be viewed as a special case of the VRPTWMD. Our heuristic is able to significantly improve a large part of the previous best-known solutions while spending notably less computation time than the comparison algorithm from the literature.

For this purpose, the MOZART (Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers)-MOSAIC (Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry) chemical reaction mechanism is extended by bromine and chlorine reactions as well as an emission mechanism for reactive bromine via heterogeneous reactions on snow surfaces. The simulation domain covers an area of <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">5040 km×4960 km</span>, centered north of UtqiaAvik (formerly Barrow), Alaska, and the time interval from February through May 2009. Several simulations for different strengths of the bromine emission are conducted and evaluated by comparison with in situ and ozone sonde measurements of ozone mixing ratios as well as by comparison with tropospheric BrO vertical column densities (VCDs) from the Global Ozone Monitoring Experiment-2 (GOME-2) satellite instrument. The base bromine emission scheme includes the direct emission of bromine due to bromide oxidation by ozone. Results of simulations with the base emission rate agree well with the observations; however, a simulation with 50 % faster emissions performs somewhat better. The bromine emission due to bromide oxidation by ozone is found to be important to provide an initial seed for the bromine explosion. Bromine release due to <span classCombining double low line""inline-formula"">N2O5</span> was found to be important from February to mid March but irrelevant thereafter. A comparison of modeled BrO with in situ and multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) data hints at missing bromine release and recycling mechanisms on land or near coasts. A consideration of halogen chemistry substantially improves the prediction of the ozone mixing ratio with respect to the observations. Meteorological nudging is essential for a good prediction of ODEs over the 3-month period.</p>. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Unlocking the potential of final users and transforming them into distributed flexibility providers requires harmonization of operation through new models such as the association in energy communities. Multi-vector energy communities (MEC) can provide further flexibility options, enable integration of local energy generation and empower energy islands to increase self-sufficiency and resilience to external impacts. In line with this, the paper develops a unified mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) model of a MEC and rigorously assesses techno-economic performances of different combinations of energy sources, vectors and consumers. That way, the potential of different MECs for providing flexibility and increasing the utilization of electricity production from local renewable energy sources is assessed. Based on the results of the MILP models, the paper further proposes novel indicators for estimation of the techno-economic and environmental potential of different multi-energy vectors in decarbonization of energy islands. Case study analysis comprises of eight scenarios with different MEC's setups with realistic data from island Ærø in Denmark and island Vis in Croatia, capturing also geographical specificities. The results show significant differences across different MEC set-ups as well as between the geographical locations, and some of the results that can be highlighted are: demand responsive electric heat pumps and use of battery energy storage systems provide stand-out energy potency and can ensure self-sufficiency with smallest capacity of electricity production from local renewable energy sources, but comes with a growing costs for the increase of storage capacity; use of imported natural gas as a transition fuel could be affordable solution but does not lead to fulfilment of self-sufficiency or environmental goals; hydrogen energy vector has significant potential, especially in cases where seasonal energy storage is needed but the costs are still a main barrier; correlation of production and consumption patterns in island Ærø in Denmark favor wind energy, while the increased capacity and production from solar plants is more favorable in island Vis in Croatia. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Decarbonization; Energy communities; Energy islands; Energy vectors; Renewable energy","Digital storage; Electric energy storage; Electric power generation; Hydrogen fuels; Hydrogen storage; Integer programming; Natural gas; Natural gasoline plants; Natural resources; Vectors; Wind power; Decarbonisation; Electricity production; Energy; Energy community; Energy island; Energy vectors; Mixed integer linear programming model; Power; Renewable energies; Techno-economics; Decarbonization",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103111666

Using the more airport-specific parameters available and ICAO standard values otherwise, the yearly emissions of NOx, HC, CO, PM10, SOx, and CO2 at YUL were, respectively, 7.64 102, 1.18 102, 1.33 103, 1.35 101, 6.77 101, and 2.31 105 tonnes/year. The results show that reducing aircraft taxi time by 31 % reduced aircraft emissions by 6 % (NOx) and 27 % (CO). Atmospheric conditions impact aircraft emissions of NOx, CO and HC with a seasonal effect. Summer conditions reduced NOx emissions by 5 % and increased CO emissions by 2 %, while winter conditions reduced HC and CO emissions by approximately 15 % and increased NOx emissions by 1 %. To further investigate the impact of atmospheric conditions, dispersion calculations of NOx and CO emissions were carried out using identical air-traffic and weather data from the warmest and coldest weeks in 2015. The results demonstrate that pollutant concentrations were higher during the winter and that pollutants were also dispersed further during the winter than the summer according to the dominant wind direction. A 1-h NOx and CO concentrations greater than 10 μg/m3 were found up to 24 km and 30 km, respectively, away during the winter compared to 14 km and 20 km during the summer. Yet, local air quality standards were satisfied as pollutant concentrations found outside the airport enclosure were below those standards. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Air pollution; Air quality modeling; Airport emissions inventory; Environment","Air quality; Air quality standards; Aircraft; Atmospheric movements; Nitrogen oxides; Taxicabs; Aircraft emissions; Atmospheric conditions; CO concentrations; International airport; NOx and CO emission; Pollutant concentration; Pollutant emission; Winter conditions; Airports; air quality; airport; atmospheric pollution; emission inventory; nitrogen dioxide; traffic emission; wind direction; air quality; aircraft; airport; Article; atmosphere; calculation; concentration (parameter); controlled study; dispersion; limit of quantitation; summer; vapor pressure; weather; winter; Canada; Montreal; Quebec [Canada]",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104533458

The initiative's main objectives were (1) to assess the state of data availability, (2) to compile time series of vertically resolved, zonal monthly mean trace gas and aerosol fields, and (3) to perform a detailed intercomparison of these time series, summarizing useful information and highlighting differences among datasets. The datasets extend over the region from the upper troposphere to the lower mesosphere (300-0.1 hPa) and are provided on a common latitude-pressure grid. They cover 26 different atmospheric constituents including the stratospheric trace gases of primary interest, ozone (O3) and water vapor (H2O), major long-lived trace gases (SF6, N2O, HF, CCl3F, CCl2F2, NOy ), trace gases with intermediate lifetimes (HCl, CH4, CO, HNO3), and shorter-lived trace gases important to stratospheric chemistry including nitrogen-containing species (NO, NO2, NOx, N2O5, HNO4), halogens (BrO, ClO, ClONO2, HOCl), and other minor species (OH, HO2, CH2O, CH3CN), and aerosol. This overview of the SPARC Data Initiative introduces the updated versions of the SPARC Data Initiative time series for the extended time period 1979-2018 and provides information on the satellite instruments included in the assessment: LIMS, SAGE I/II/III, HALOE, UARS-MLS, POAM II/III, OSIRIS, SMR, MIPAS, GOMOS, SCIAMACHY, ACE-FTS, ACEMAESTRO, Aura-MLS, HIRDLS, SMILES, and OMPS-LP. It describes the Data Initiative's top-down climatological validation approach to compare stratospheric composition measurements based on zonal monthly mean fields, which provides upper bounds to relative inter-instrument biases and an assessment of how well the instruments are able to capture geophysical features of the stratosphere. An update to previously published evaluations of O3 and H2O monthly mean time series is provided. In addition, example trace gas evaluations of methane (CH4), carbon monoxide (CO), a set of nitrogen species (NO, NO2, and HNO3), the reactive nitrogen family (NOy ), and hydroperoxyl (HO2) are presented. The results highlight the quality, strengths and weaknesses, and representativeness of the different datasets. As a summary, the current state of our knowledge of stratospheric composition and variability is provided based on the overall consistency between the datasets. As such, the SPARC Data Initiative datasets and evaluations can serve as an atlas or reference of stratospheric composition and variability during the ""golden age""of atmospheric limb sounding. The updated SPARC Data Initiative zonal monthly mean time series for each instrument are publicly available and accessible via the Zenodo data archive (Hegglin et al., 2020). © 2021 The Author(s).",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105565887

However, quantifying this unique scenario is challenging as meteorology may mask the real changes in observed NH3 concentrations. Here, we applied a machine learning technique to decouple the effects of meteorology and confirmed that the real (deweathered) NH3 concentration dropped to a minimum during the Spring Festival in 2019 and 2020 at both urban (Beijing) and rural (Xianghe) sites on the North China Plain. Compared with the scenario without the Spring Festival effect, we predicted that NH3 concentrations in 2020 were 39.8% and 24.6% higher than the observed values at the urban and rural sites, respectively. The significant difference between the two sites indicates a larger reduction in anthropogenic NH3 emissions in urban areas than in rural areas due to the Spring Festival and lockdown measures of COVID-19. Future control strategies should consider the emissions of NH3 from the transportation, industrial and residential sectors, considering that agricultural emissions are minor in cold seasons. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air pollution; Ammonia emissions; Control strategy; COVID-19; Random forest model; Spring Festival","Agricultural robots; Ammonia; Industrial emissions; Learning systems; Meteorology; Rural areas; Springs (components); Turing machines; Agricultural emissions; Ammonia concentrations; Control strategies; Machine learning techniques; North China Plain; Residential sectors; Social activities; Urban and rural sites; Urban growth; algorithm; ammonia; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); COVID-19; emission control; numerical model; winter; China; North China Plain",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100690328

In this paper, we constructed an example water rights trading model in the arid oasis area of Shihezi Irrigation District (located in Northwest China), using the field investigation method and governmental water management decisions based on the systems theory of the agricultural water savings–economy–ecological environ-ment. Furthermore, focusing on the added industrial value produced by trading water, the value of the ecological services provided by fresh water, the negative value of the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, and the negative ecological value of reduced fertilizer application, a quantitative analysis was carried out using the Shihezi Irrigation District as an example. The results showed that under the most stringent water resource management plan and with the objective of returning land and reducing water, the irrigation area can save 52,504,500 m3 of surplus water from the agricultural sector, of which 49,879,300 m3 can be reallocated to the industrial sector and 2,625,200 m3 can be reallocated to the ecological sector. Using the water rights transaction method, this regional agricultural water saving could generate an industrial benefit equal to 35,024,300 yuan, an ecosystem service equal to 19,482,200 yuan, and an overall benefit equal to 54,420,500 yuan.

It is unclear which air pollutants are the culprit. Objective: We assessed the associations of six air pollutants and air quality index (AQI) with cognitive impairment. Methods: We examined 7,311 participants aged ≥60 years from the ZJMPHS cohort in China. They were interviewed for baseline socio-demographic and disease risk factors in 2014, and re-interviewed in 2015 and 2016, respectively. The presence of cognitive impairment was determined by the Chinese version of the Mini-Mental State Examination. Daily area-level data monitored for air pollution during 2013-2015 was then examined for associations with cognitive impairment in logistic regression models. Results: Over the two years follow-up, 1,652 participants developed cognitive impairment, of which 917 were severe cases. Continuous air pollution data showed the risk of cognitive impairment increased with exposure to PM2.5 (fully adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.04, 95%CI 1.01-1.08), PM10 (1.03, 1.001-1.06), and SO2 (1.04, 1.01-1.08), but not with NO2, CO, O3, and AQI. Categorized data analysis for low, middle, and high level exposure demonstrated that the aOR increased with PM2.5 and AQI, somehow with PM10 and CO, but not significantly with SO2 and NO2, and decreased with O3. The patterns for these associations with severe cognitive impairment were stronger. Conclusion: Lowering PM2.5, PM10, SO2, and CO level could reduce the risk of cognitive impairment in older Chinese. Strategies to target most important air pollutants should be an integral component of cognitive interventions. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.","Air pollution; Air quality index; China; Cognitive impairment; Cohort",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110925431

Population expansion, economic growth, and temperature increase are incorporated to estimate the probability of the magnitude of PM2.5 emission increase. Three possible sectors for the reduction of PM2.5 emissions are considered: ocean-going vessels, refineries, and electricity-generating units. The decision of how best to allocate emissions-reduction efforts among these three sectors is analyzed using a quantitative and qualitative decision-analysis framework. For quantitative analysis, Expected Monetary Value (EMV) and Expected Utility (EU) methods are used to select the optimal sector to invest in. Based on the EMV calculation, the refineries sector is 3.5 times and 6.4 times more worthy of investment compared to the electricity-generating units and the ocean-going vessels sector, respectively. For the qualitative analysis, three criteria (investment efficiency, implementation difficulty, time to become effective) are considered in the decision-making process and sensitivity analysis is conducted to inform the ocean-going vessel sector is the optimal alternative for all possible scenarios. The refineries sector is more preferred than the electricity-generating units sector when the implementation difficulty’s weight is smaller than 50%. This study provides a valuable risk and decision analysis framework for analyzing the air pollution problem associated with the future PM2.5 concentration increase caused by three risk factors: population growth, economic growth, and climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

We use the JULES land surface model coupled to an inverted form of the IMOGEN climate emulator to investigate mitigation scenarios that achieve the 1.5 or 2 °C warming targets of the Paris Agreement. Specifically, within this IMOGEN-JULES framework, we focus on and characterise the global and regional effectiveness of land-based (BECCS and/or AR) and anthropogenic methane (CH4) emission mitigation, separately and in combination, on the anthropogenic fossil fuel carbon dioxide (CO2) emission budgets (AFFEBs) to 2100.We use consistent data and socio-economic assumptions from the IMAGE integrated assessment model for the second Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP2). The analysis includes the effects of the methane and carbon-climate feedbacks from wetlands and permafrost thaw, which we have shown previously to be significant constraints on the AFFEBs. Globally, mitigation of anthropogenic CH4 emissions has large impacts on the anthropogenic fossil fuel emission budgets, potentially offsetting (i.e. allowing extra) carbon dioxide emissions of 188-212 Gt C. This is because of (a) the reduction in the direct and indirect radiative forcing of methane in response to the lower emissions and hence atmospheric concentration of methane and (b) carbon-cycle changes leading to increased uptake by the land and ocean by CO2-based fertilisation. Methane mitigation is beneficial everywhere, particularly for the major CH4-emitting regions of India, the USA, and China. Land-based mitigation has the potential to offset 51- 100 GtC globally, the large range reflecting assumptions and uncertainties associated with BECCS. The ranges for CH4 reduction and BECCS implementation are valid for both the 1.5 and 2 °C warming targets. That is the mitigation potential of the CH4 and of the land-based scenarios is similar for regardless of which of the final stabilised warming levels society aims for. Further, both the effectiveness and the preferred land management strategy (i.e. AR or BECCS) have strong regional dependencies. Additional analysis shows extensive BECCS could adversely affect water security for several regions. Although the primary requirement remains mitigation of fossil fuel emissions, our results highlight the potential for the mitigation of CH4 emissions to make the Paris climate targets more achievable. © Author(s) 2021.",,"Atmospheric radiation; Budget control; Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Methane; Reforestation; Anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions; Atmospheric concentration; Carbon cycle changes; Carbon dioxide emissions; Fossil fuel emissions; Indirect radiative forcing; Integrated assessment models; Land surface modeling; Climate models; afforestation; anthropogenic source; carbon storage; global warming; greenhouse gas; methane; reforestation; regional pattern",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105604365

If set by radiative equilibrium with the central star, the temperature of dust in the disc plateaus at around 10–20 K in the outer regions. However, sufficiently nearby massive stars can heat the outer disc to substantially higher temperatures. In this paper, we study the radiative equilibrium temperature of discs in the presence of massive external sources and gauge the effect that it has on millimetre dust mass estimates. Since millimetre grains are not entrained in any wind, we focus on geometrically simple 2D axisymmetric disc models using radiative transfer calculations with both the host star and an external source. Recent surveys have searched for evidence of massive stars influencing disc evolution using disc properties as a function of projected separation. In assuming a disc temperature of 20 K for a disc a distance D from a strong radiation source, disc masses are overestimated by a factor that scales with D−1/2 interior to the separation that external heating becomes important. This could significantly alter dust mass estimates of discs in close proximity to θ1C in the Orion Nebular Cluster (ONC). We also make an initial assessment of the effect upon snow lines. Within a parsec of an O star like θ1C a CO snow line no longer exists, though the water snow line is virtually unaffected except for very close separations of ≤ 0.01 pc. © 2021 The Author(s).

Based on the STIRPAT (Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology) framework, we applied the advanced and robust methods of dynamic seemingly unrelated regression (DSUR), dynamic OLS (DOLS), and fully modified OLS (FMOLS) to estimate the long-term effects. The empirical findings revealed the inverted U-shaped effects of urbanization and urban agglomeration and the U-shaped impact of the largest city ratio on CO2 emissions. Urbanization and urban agglomerations improve environmental quality in the long-run and support ecological modernization theory. However, excessive concentration in the largest cities have severely affected the environmental quality and violates the notion of compact-city efficiencies. Moreover, energy intensity and economic growth positively affect CO2 emissions, while trade openness negatively influences CO2 emissions. Our robustness analysis at the country-level applies the augmented mean group (AMG) panel ARDL technique, which further supports the non-linear effect of urbanization paths on CO2 emissions except for a few countries. The results of the panel Granger non-causality approach unveil bidirectional causality of energy efficiency, economic growth, urbanization, and largest city ratio with CO2 emissions. In contrast, unidirectional causality runs from urban agglomeration to CO2 emissions. Our findings have important policy implications as we suggest green urban infrastructures, eco-friendly dwellings, smart cities, country-specific trade policies, and renewable energy options to improve the environmental quality. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","AMG; City compactness; CO2 emissions; DSUR; Ecological modernization theory; Urbanization paths",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102340473

Diagnostic indicators that allow comparison across these models can help describe and explain differences in model projections. This increases transparency and comparability. Earlier, the IAM community has developed an approach to diagnose models (Kriegler (2015 Technol. Forecast. Soc. Change 90 45-61)). Here we build on this, by proposing a selected set of well-defined indicators as a community standard, to systematically and routinely assess IAM behaviour, similar to metrics used for other modeling communities such as climate models. These indicators are the relative abatement index, emission reduction type index, inertia timescale, fossil fuel reduction, transformation index and cost per abatement value. We apply the approach to 17 IAMs, assessing both older as well as their latest versions, as applied in the IPCC 6th Assessment Report. The study shows that the approach can be easily applied and used to indentify key differences between models and model versions. Moreover, we demonstrate that this comparison helps to link model behavior to model characteristics and assumptions. We show that together, the set of six indicators can provide useful indication of the main traits of the model and can roughly indicate the general model behavior. The results also show that there is often a considerable spread across the models. Interestingly, the diagnostic values often change for different model versions, but there does not seem to be a distinct trend. © 2021 The Author(s).

Secondly, it attempts to ensure that the concentration of nitrogen oxides (NOx) does not exceed the emission standard, to drop the consumption of the reducing agent, and to save operating costs. Therefore, some key factors, such as the number of spray guns affect denitrification efficiency and the amount of ammonia escape, were chosen as the operating parameters to be optimized. Meanwhile, a 150 MW CFB boiler in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region of China was employed for the experimentation. We then designed and implemented the optimization experiments of the SNCR denitrification system, including optimizing the operating parameters and deeply optimizing the SNCR denitrification process. The denitrification efficiency can reach 76.6% when there are four spray guns with valve opening of 50, 100, 100, and 50% respectively from top to bottom.

However, coral reef communities are increasingly threatened by the adverse impacts of human activities at both global and local scales. This study aims to develop an integrated dynamic assessment framework to evaluate coral reef conditions under different adaptation and climate change scenarios, and their consequential economic impacts in the small island community of Port Resolution on Tanna Island in Vanuatu. Our assessment framework follows a sequential multilayered modelling approach that uses System Dynamics (SD) coupled with Bayesian Network (BN) modelling to deal with the complexity and dynamicity of socioeconomic and environmental systems, and impacts from trans-discipline variables. The BN incorporated existing data and expert knowledge to project the future conditions of coral reefs under different scenario settings, and to parametrise and quantify the SD model where the existing data and information was insufficient. The SD was then used to simulate the dynamic relationship between coral reef condition and the economic benefits derived from its ecosystem services under different climate change (i.e. RCPs) and management scenarios through to 2070. Our findings show that sustainable community-based conservation management strategies are key to preserving the flow of coral reef ecosystem services under RCP 2.6 and 6.0. Importantly, we demonstrate that the implementation of an integrated portfolio of management strategies better protects ecosystem services provided by coral reefs and maximises the total economic benefits achieved over the long-term despite a temporary and short-term economic loss due to high initial capital investments and income reduction due to fishing and tourism restrictions. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic pressures; Bayesian networks (BN); Ecosystem services valuation; Ecosystem-based management; Structural analysis; Systems dynamics (SD)","adaptation; climate change; conservation management; coral reef; ecological modeling; ecosystem service; human activity; marine ecosystem; small island state; strategic approach; article; Bayesian network; climate change; coral reef; fishing; human; investment; outcome assessment; quantitative analysis; structure analysis; tourism; Vanuatu; animal; Anthozoa; Bayes theorem; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; Tanna; Vanuatu; Animals; Anthozoa; Bayes Theorem; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Coral Reefs; Ecosystem; Humans",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100751824

Further, increasing concerns with changing climate and building energy efficiency highlight the importance of ventilation and comfort in educational settings. The existing literature on indoor air quality (IAQ), ventilation, and thermal comfort in classrooms in subtropical regions of Australia is sparse. Here, we present the results of a field study conducted in secondary school classrooms in Sydney during the school year in 2018 and 2019. We collected data with subjective surveys through questionnaires and with field measurements related to IAQ the thermal comfort in two adjacent similar classrooms. The infiltration and ventilation rates were measured during the non-occupied period using the concentration decay method. We analysed the performance of a cloud-connected demand-controlled mechanical extract ventilation system (DCV), which was installed in one of the two surveyed classrooms during mid-season. Before application of the DCV, CO2 levels were similar in both classrooms with a maximum concentration of approximately 2418 ppm during cold season. The DCV reduced the peak CO2 concentration to 1335 ppm, while CO2 raised to 2981 ppm in the classrooms without DCV during mid-season. Further, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) analysed from air samples show improved air quality in the classroom with DCV. Our results highlight the impact of both indoor temperature and CO2 concentration on students’ feeling of fatigue. Students showed adaptability to indoor temperature change. A period of one week is needed for students’ adaptation to a step change in the mean outdoor temperature. Understanding classroom indoor air quality and thermal environment, as well as students’ perceived comfort, is vital to develop child-based design guidelines for schools. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Air quality; Indoor environmental quality; School buildings; Thermal comfort; Ventilation","Air conditioning; Air quality; Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Indoor air pollution; School buildings; Space heating; Students; Surveys; Ventilation; Volatile organic compounds; CO$-2$/ concentration; Indoor air quality; Indoor environmental quality; Indoor temperature; Indoor thermal comfort; Learning productivity; Potential impacts; Thermal; Thermal condition; Ventilation systems; Thermal comfort",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102410682

Thus, in 2019, there has been a strong policy push towards increasing the share of renewables in heating through the introduction of the Climate Action Programme 2030 and the reform of existing policies. In addition to the policy landscape on the national level, federal states have further leeway to implement policies; these options are currently largely unresearched. In order to fill this gap, we developed a System Dynamics Model for Lower Saxony to determine the effect of recent policy changes as well as additional regional subsidy schemes on the heating market. The results show that even though changes in subsidies can increase the renewable uptake considerably, the CO2e and energy demand reduction targets are not met in any of the examined scenarios. Furthermore, the model shows that policy formulation must take the inertia of the sector into account and completely turn away from fossil fuels to reach the stipulated emission reductions. © 2021 by the authors.

To this end, the study investigates the connection between biomass energy consumption, real GDP, investment in the energy sector, and CO2 emissions in the emerging (E7) countries – China, India, Brazil, Mexico, the Russian Federation, Indonesia and Turkey – for the period 2000–2018. The study uses a battery of techniques, namely Pooled Mean Group-autoregressive distributed lag, ordinary least square, dynamic ordinary least square, Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (PMG-ARDL, OLS, DOLS FMOLS) and causality estimators, to measure the robustness of the conceptualized relationship among the variables of interest. Empirical results show that conventional energy from fossil fuel sources is a driver of CO2 emissions within the E7 economies. On the other hand, biomass energy consumption and investments in the energy sector decrease CO2 emissions. Furthermore, a feedback causality relationship between biomass energy consumption and CO2 emissions is observed. Similarly, a feedback causality relationship is seen between economic growth and biomass energy consumption. Our study's empirical findings reveal that biomass energy consumption mitigated CO2 emissions in the E7 economies that were examined, suggesting the pivotal role for biomass energy consumption in creating an eco-friendly environment and environmental sustainability.

Drawing from research across three districts in northern Ghana, this study employs a mixed-methods approach and an interpretivist framework to develop understanding of how farmers are implementing Indigenous adaptation strategies in response to climate change risks at both household and community scales. Farmers are perceiving multiple climate risks such as increased temperatures, erratic rainfall and prolonged droughts, which are disrupting cropping calendars and decreasing productivity. In response to those impacts, farming households are utilising Indigenous knowledge to individually implement diverse strategies such as rainwater harvesting, relocation of farms to water sources, neem leaf extract and organic manure applications, while communities are collectively engaging in congregational prayers, rituals for rainmaking, taboos, investment in local irrigation systems and tree planting. Farmers’ adaptation strategies are evolving over time, as many people are integrating Indigenous practices with modern knowledge and technologies to facilitate improvements in irrigation, organic manure application, planting drought-resistant crops, agroforestry and crop diversification.

This paper established an industrial VOC emission inventory in 2015 for Hebei Province and completed an emission projection for the period 2020–2030. The results indicated that the total emissions of industrial VOCs in 2015 were 1017.79 kt. The use of VOC products accounted for more than half of the total. In addition, the spatial distribution characteristics of the industrial VOC emissions were determined using a geographic information statistics system (GIS), which showed that the VOCs were mainly distributed the central and southern regions of Hebei. Considering the future economic development trends, population changes, related environmental laws and regulations, and pollution control technology, three scenarios were defined for forecasting the industrial VOC emissions in future years. This demonstrated that industrial VOC emissions in Hebei would amount to 1448.94 kt and 2203.66 kt in 2020 and 2030, with growth rates of 42.36% and 116.51% compared with 2015, respectively. If all industrial enterprises took the control measures, the VOC emissions could be reduced by 69% in 2030. The analysis of the scenarios found that the most effective action plan was to take the best available control technologies and clean production in key industries, including the chemical medicine, coke production, mechanical equipment manufacturing, organic chemical, packaging and printing, wood adhesive, industrial and construction dye, furniture manufacturing, transportation equipment manufacturing, and crude oil processing industries. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the flow and exchange of carbon emissions caused by international trade has further increased the difficulty of determining carbon emissions responsibilities and advancing world's emission reductions. Based on the multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model, this study analysed the flow and outsourcing of carbon emissions among six regions of the world in 2014, and applied the regional environmental inequality (REI) index to measure the unequal environmental exchanges among regions. We found that global carbon emissions reached nearly 35Gt, of which more than 20% were outsourced to other regions. Especially developed regions, such as EU 28, USA and Japan, had significantly higher consumption-based carbon emissions than production-based carbon emissions. The unequal environmental exchanges mainly occurred between developed regions and underdeveloped regions.

To explore a pH optimum, the online N2O emission and the bacterial composition and function in the anoxic–oxic process were investigated. The mean gaseous N2O emission accounted for 0.329%, 0.103%, 0.085%, and 0.793% of the influent total nitrogen at pH of 5, 6, 8, and 9, respectively. Incomplete oxidation in oxic tanks was the primary source of N2O, while N2O in the anoxic tank was mainly generated by nitrifier denitrification. No direct correlations were observed between N2O emission and potential nitrifiers and denitrifiers. The impacts of pH on N2O generation were more likely related to the response of bacterial enzymes and nitrogen compounds, rather than the feedback of bacterial community structure itself.

In order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, various countries are making relevant policies as much as possible. In the transportation sector, the exhaust emissions generated by the driving of automobiles account for a large proportion of the overall carbon emissions. It is of great significance to formulate relevant plans to reduce the distribution of carbon emissions in accordance with the relationship between the distribution of carbon emissions in traffic trajectories and urban functional areas. This paper preprocesses the online car-hailing trajectory information, and converts the fuel consumption and gas consumption data in the trajectory information into carbon emissions calculations. Then the obtained data is visually displayed, and the SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average model) algorithm is used to predict and analyze the carbon emission value and perform error analysis. The experimental results prove that the short-term prediction through the SARIMA algorithm has high accuracy. The analysis shows that when SARIMA (1,1,1)×(0,1,1,7), the mean square error of the prediction result is 10.57.

The conversion of organic matter to methane (methanogenesis) as a mechanism for energy conservation is exclusively attributed to the archaeal domain. Methane is oxidized by methanotrophic microorganisms using oxygen or alternative terminal electron acceptors. Aerobic methanotrophic bacteria belong to the phyla Proteobacteria and Verrucomicrobia, while anaerobic methane oxidation is also mediated by more recently discovered anaerobic methanotrophs with representatives in both the bacteria and the archaea domains. The anaerobic oxidation of methane is coupled to the reduction of nitrate, nitrite, iron, manganese, sulfate, and organic electron acceptors (e.g., humic substances) as terminal electron acceptors. This review highlights the relevance of methanotrophy in natural and anthropogenically influenced ecosystems, emphasizing the environmental conditions, distribution, function, co-existence, interactions, and the availability of electron acceptors that likely play a key role in regulating their function. A systematic overview of key aspects of ecology, physiology, metabolism, and genomics is crucial to understand the contribution of methanotrophs in the mitigation of methane efflux to the atmosphere. We give significance to the processes under microaerophilic and anaerobic conditions for both aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidizers. In the context of anthropogenically influenced ecosystems, we emphasize the current and potential future applications of methanotrophs from two different angles, namely methane mitigation in wastewater treatment through the application of anaerobic methanotrophs, and the biotechnological applications of aerobic methanotrophs in resource recovery from methane waste streams. Finally, we identify knowledge gaps that may lead to opportunities to harness further the biotechnological benefits of methanotrophs in methane mitigation and for the production of valuable bioproducts enabling a bio-based and circular economy. © Copyright © 2021 Guerrero-Cruz, Vaksmaa, Horn, Niemann, Pijuan and Ho.","anaerobic; application; circular economy; climate change; methane; methanotrophy; microbial ecology; resource recovery","biopolymer; ectoine; hydrogen sulfide; iron; manganese; methane; nitrate; nitrite; nitrogen; organic matter; oxygen; sulfate; aerobic bacterium; anaerobic ammonium oxidation; anaerobic bacterium; biomass; biotechnology; denitrification; energy conservation; energy resource; environmental management; methanogenesis; methanotroph; microbial community; microbial diversity; microbial growth; nonhuman; osmotic stress; oxidation; prevalence; Proteobacteria; Review; Verrucomicrobia; waste water management; water solubility",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107044473

Depending on extensive measurement networks, high-resolution air temperature measurements in urban environments are challenging due to high instrumentation and maintenance costs. Here, we present a low-cost measurement device (LCD) consisting of a temperature logger and a custom-made, naturally ventilated radiation shield. Besides intercomparisons with automated weather stations (AWS) at three reference sites during record-dry summer 2018, we tested the potential of the devices using a network of 79 LCDs to assess the intra-urban variability of urban heat island (UHI) patterns in the city of Bern, Switzerland. We found positive mean measurement biases between LCDs and AWS of 0.61 to 0.93 K (RMSE: 0.78 to 1.17 K) during daytime, of which up to 82.8% of the variance could be explained statistically by solar irradiance (radiative heating) and wind speed (insufficient ventilation). During night, average measurement biases were markedly lower and eventually negative with −0.12 to 0.23 K (RMSE: 0.19 to 0.34 K). Our results highlight the importance of sensor intercomparisons being conducted at multiple locations with differing urban land-cover, structure, and metabolism given that biases varied considerably between the reference sites. Data retrieved by the city-wide measurement network showed that the LCD approach is well suited for the analysis of spatiotemporal UHI patterns during night and adds considerable value compared to the few existing AWS in detecting fine-scale air temperature variability. In conclusion, the current LCD measurement approach represents a valuable option for cost-effective analyses of urban air temperature variability across multiple scales, which may be of particular value for the development, appliance, and monitoring of adaptation strategies to climate change in cities with restricted financial resources. © 2021 The Author(s)","Air temperature; Low-cost; Measurement network; Radiation shield; Urban climate; Urban heat island",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102346061

Taking the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) regions as typical cluster cities, the Weather Research Forecasting (WRF) and Comprehensive Air Quality Model with Extension (CAMx) were introduced to demonstrate the meteorological and emission contribution and PM2.5 flux distribution. The results showed that the PM2.5 concentration in BTH and YRD significantly declined with a descend ratio of −39.6% and −28.1%, respectively. For the meteorological contribution, those regions had a similar tendency with unfavorable conditions in 2013–2015 (contribution concentration 1.6–3.8 µg/m3 and 1.1–3.6 µg/m3 ) and favorable in 2016 (contribution concentration −1.5 µg/m3 and −0.2 µg/m3 ). Further, the absolute value of the net flux’s intensity was positively correlated with the degree of the favorable/unfavorable weather conditions. When it came to emission intensity, the total net inflow flux increased, and the outflow flux decreased significantly across the border with the emission increasing.

Quantitative assessments of the contribution of transport to pollution in inland and coastal cities are necessary for the implementation of practical, regional, and joint emission control strategies. In this study, the Comprehensive Air Quality Model (CAMx), together with the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF), was used to simulate the contributions to pollution of different cities in 2016. The monthly inflow, outflow, and net flux from the ground to the extended layers served as the three main indicators for the analysis of the interactions of PM2.5 transport between adjacent cities. Between inland and coastal cities, the magnitude of inflow and outflow are larger in the former than in the latter. The inflow flux in the inland cities (Beijing and Shijiazhuang) was 10.6 and 10.7 kt/day, respectively, while that in the coastal cities (Tianjin, Shanghai, Hefei, Nanjing, and Hangzhou) was 9.1, 3.3, 5.8, 4.4, and 3.7 kt/day, respectively. In terms of variation over the year, the strongest inflow in the BTH region occurred in April, followed by October, July, and January, while that in the coastal cities in YRD occurred in January, followed by October, April, and July. Therefore, based on the flux intensity calculations and the transport flux pathways, effective joint control measures can be provided with scientific support, and a better understanding of the evolutionary mechanism among inland and coastal cities can be acquired. © 2020","coastal cities; inland cities; modeling system; PM2.5 flux; regional transport","Air quality; Emission control; Air quality modeling; Control strategies; Evolutionary mechanisms; Local pollutions; Quantitative assessments; Temporal and spatial; Transport fluxes; Weather research and forecasting models; Weather forecasting; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon emission; emission control; flux chamber; outflow; particulate matter; China; air pollutant; air pollution; China; city; environmental monitoring; particulate matter; season; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Beijing; China; Cities; Environmental Monitoring; Particulate Matter; Seasons",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096637661

However, the photocatalytic performance of ZrO2 is relatively poor due to the negligible use of the solar spectrum caused by the wide bandgap (Eg = 5.3 eV). Here, we report plasmon enhanced Au nanoparticles decorated onto ZrO2 through a facile tannic acid-reduction method. The Au/ZrO2 heterojunctions exhibited efficient and stable photocatalytic activity of reducing CO2 into main CO and CH4, at the rates of 25.6 μmol g-1 h-1 and 5.1 μmol g-1 h-1 at most, respectively, approximately 6-fold enhanced compared to the pristine ZrO2, under simulated solar light. The reduction rates could also be improved over 10-fold under visible light when Au nanoparticles were loaded onto ZrO2. UV-Vis diffuse reflectance spectra confirmed the enhanced visible-light absorption of Au/ZrO2 caused by localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR). Electrochemical impedance spectra (EIS) and photocurrent tests proved the more efficient charge transport and electron-hole separation of Au/ZrO2 heterojunctions.

During biological nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), high N2O fluxes to the atmosphere can occur, typically exhibiting a seasonal emission pattern. Attempts to explain the peak emission phases in winter and spring using physico-chemical process data from WWTP were so far unsuccessful and new approaches are required. The complex and diverse microbial community of activated sludge used in biological treatment systems also exhibit substantial seasonal patterns. However, a potentially causal link between the seasonal patterns of microbial diversity and N2O emissions has not yet been investigated. Here we show that in a full-scale WWTP nitrification failure and N2O peak emissions, bad settleability of the activated sludge and a turbid effluent strongly correlate with a significant reduction in the microbial community diversity and shifts in community composition. During episodes of impaired performance, we observed a significant reduction in abundance for filamentous and nitrite oxidizing bacteria in all affected reactors. In some reactors that did not exhibit nitrification and settling failures, we observed a stable microbial community and no drastic loss of species. Standard engineering approaches to stabilize nitrification, such as increasing the aerobic sludge age and oxygen availability failed to improve the plant performance on this particular WWTP and replacing the activated sludge was the only measure applied by the operators to recover treatment performance in affected reactors. Our results demonstrate that disturbances of the sludge microbiome affect key structural and functional microbial groups, which lead to seasonal N2O emission patterns. To reduce N2O emissions from WWTP, it is therefore crucial to understand the drivers that lead to the microbial population dynamics in the activated sludge. © 2021","Activated sludge microbiome; Amplicon sequencing; Denitrification; Nitrification; Physico-chemical monitoring","Activated sludge process; Bacteria; Biological water treatment; Effluents; Failure (mechanical); Greenhouse gases; Nitrification; Nitrogen oxides; Nitrogen removal; Ozone layer; Sewage pumping plants; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment plants; Biological nitrogen removal; Biological treatment systems; Microbial population dynamics; Nitrite-oxidizing bacteria; Physicochemical process; Sbr wastewater treatments; Stratospheric ozone depletion; Wastewater treatment plants; Sewage treatment plants; nitrous oxide; RNA 16S; activated sludge; bacterium; microbial activity; microbial community; nitrification; nitrite; population dynamics; seasonality; sludge; turbidity; wastewater treatment; wastewater treatment plant; activated sludge; amplicon; Article; controlled study; denitrification; microbial community; microbial population dynamics; multidimensional scaling; nitrification; nonhuman; ozone depletion; ozone layer; priority journal; sludge; waste component removal; waste water treatment plant",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103701800

With small population sizes, long reproduction times, and a rapidly warming habitat, thorny skate (Amblyraja radiata) could be particularly vulnerable. To examine this possibility, we used a two-stage generalized additive model to project future thorny skate abundances under two different climate scenarios. This is the first study in the northeastern United States to compare projections based on different survey methods (bottom trawl and longline), and results were heavily impacted by survey methodology. Models trained with the NOAA Bottom Trawl Survey projected a decrease in abundance of ~60%–80% in the Gulf of Maine and Georges Bank under the RCP 8.5 climate scenario. With aggressive mitigation (RCP 4.5), these decreases could be reduced to ~35%–45%. Models trained with a recent NOAA longline survey indicated that thorny skate abundance would be reduced 22% and 37% under business as usual and mitigation, respectively. There are substantial methodological differences between the two data sets, including capture technique and efficiency, total habitat coverage, and spatio-temporal coverage. This underscores the importance of continued, methodologically diverse surveys on the Northeast US continental shelf. Our results indicate that climate change will continue to negatively impact thorny skate populations by reducing the amount of thermally suitable habitat in the southern extent of their range.

It has been proffered as a key component of climate policy, yet evidence clearly shows that its effects are marginal. It provides limited emissions reductions and has provoked considerable political controversy in key large-emitting countries. More importantly, pricing carbon means viewing climate change as a market failure, rather than as a problem of societal transformation. But rapid decarbonization will require more than market corrections; it demands strong state intervention to reorganize the economy. In this maximalist view, the state must create public goods, rather than merely prevent public bads. This article seeks to expand our collective political imagination about climate policy, moving beyond mundane fights about the appropriate design of carbon pricing. Instead, we need to think bigger. Aggressive climate policy begins with a reassertion of state sovereignty. Multinational corporations use ‘offshore’ tax havens to avoid paying taxes. By closing loopholes on corporate tax evasion, states reaffirm one of their fundamental functions: taxation. This reform would repatriate billions of dollars in missing capital, and help create the political conditions for meaningful action on decarbonization.

Robust assessment of source contributions in a typical urban land-use pattern is the prime step for development of effective emission control strategies. This necessitates a critical review of the PM2.5 source apportionment studies conducted in different urban land uses and delineation of the dominant sources along with its contribution to reveal the diversifications among the peculiar land use classifications even within the same city. The present study reviewed the source apportionment studies carried out at 37 locations from seven Indian cities and categorized the sources contribution on seasonal (winters and summers) average basis for residential, commercial, industrial, kerbside, and mixed locations. The findings of the review studies inferred considerable variations in the source’s contribution to air pollution with land use change. For example, during winter, domestic/biomass emission was reported as a significant source in residential (34%), commercial (26%), mixed (46%), industrial (31%), and road side (27%) locations in Delhi city in North India. However, vehicle (57%) was found to be the dominant source in residential area whose contribution increased up to 76% at road side location in Bangalore City in South India. It is also observed that source contributions vary in different seasons depending upon the activity levels. More or less similar observation was found in other cities selected for this study. The variations in source apportionment findings for a particular city might be attributed to heterogeneity of sources/major activity areas, nonuniform adoption of methodology.

In this study, species-specific equations were developed for estimating dry harvest residues (kg) from stem volume (m3) in the fast-growing Pinus pinaster Ait., Pinus radiata D. Don and Eucalyptus spp., which generate around 95% of harvested wood. The presence of heteroscedasticity was taken into account in model fitting. Regional dry harvest residues were estimated using the equations and regional harvested volume records (m3), by assuming a mean harvested tree of diameter at breast height of 45 cm for pines and 25 cm for eucalyptus. A moisture content (M) of 25% was assumed for direct combustion of harvest residues; therefore, wet values were calculated from dry estimates, and a lower heating value (M = 25%) was used. The bioenergy potentially produced from the estimated harvest residues (M = 25%) was 377 ktoe year−1 in the period 2018–2019, equivalent to 4.7% of the total primary energy consumption in Galicia in 2018. Currently 70% of potential bioenergy production is concentrated in a sub-region representing 40% of the whole region.

Here, we report on the synthesis, char-acterization, and photobehavior of a new HOF (T12F-1(124TCB)) based on a dehydrobenzoannulene derivative containing fluorine atoms (T12F-COOH). This HOF exhibits a 2D porous sheet, which is hexagonally networked via H-bonds between the carboxylic groups, and has an interlayers distance (4.3 Å) that is longer than that of a typical π–π interaction. The presence of the fluorine atoms in the DBA molecular units largely increases the emission quantum yield in DMF (0.33, T12F-COOH) when compared to the parent compound (0.02, T12-COOH). The time-resolved dynamics of T12F-COOH in DMF is governed by the emission from a locally excited state (S1, ~ 0.4 ns), a charge-transfer state (S1(CT), ~ 2 ns), and a room temperature emissive triplet state (T1, ~ 20 ns), in addition to a non-emissive triplet structure with a charge-transfer character (T1(CT), τ = 0.75 µs). We also report on the results using T12F-ester. Interestingly, FLIM experiments on single crystals unravel that the emission lifetimes of the crystalline HOF are almost twice those of the amorphous ones or the solid T12F-ester sample.

The lockdown restricted major anthropogenic activities, primarily vehicular and industrial, thereby reducing the particulate matter concentration. This work investigates the variation in Black Carbon (BC) concentration and its sources (primarily Fossil Fuel (ff) burning and Biomass Burning (bb)) over Delhi from 18th February to July 31, 2020, covering one month of pre-lockdown phase, all the lockdown phases, and two months of successive lockdown relaxations. The daily average BC concentration varied from 0.22 to 16.92 μg/m3, with a mean value of 3.62 ± 2.93 μg/m3. During Pre-Lockdown (PL, 18th Feb-24th March 2020), Lockdown-1 (L1, 25th March-14th April 2020), Lockdown-2 (L2, 15th April-3rd May 2020), Lockdown-3 (L3, 4th-17th May 2020), Lockdown-4 (L4, 18th-31st May 2020), Unlock-1 (UN1, June 2020), and Unlock-2 (UN2, July 2020) the average BC concentrations were 7.93, 1.73, 2.59, 3.76, 3.26, 2.07, and 2.70 μg/m3, respectively. During the lockdown and unlock phases, BC decreased up to 78% compared to the PL period. The BC source apportionment studies show that fossil fuel burning was the dominant BC source during the entire sampling period. From L1 to UN2 an increasing trend in BCff contribution was observed (except L3) due to the successive relaxations given to anthropogenic activities. BCff contribution dipped briefly during L3 due to the intensive crop residue burning events in neighboring states. CWT analysis showed that local emission sources were the dominant contributors to BC concentration over Delhi. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Absorption angstrom exponent; Aethalometer; Black carbon; COVID-19; Lockdown; Source apportionment","Agricultural wastes; Carbon; Anthropogenic activity; Biomass-burning; Crop residue burning; Fossil fuel burning; Local emissions; Particulate Matter; Sampling period; Source apportionment; Fossil fuels; black carbon; fossil fuel; carbon; absorption; Article; biomass; boundary layer; carbon source; circadian rhythm; coronavirus disease 2019; high temperature; India; lockdown; maximum concentration; particulate matter; plant residue; wind speed; aerosol; air pollutant; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; human; pandemic; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Carbon; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; India; Pandemics; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099248740

Improvement in city air quality has emerged as a benefit of this lockdown in India. The objective of this paper is to quantify the health benefits due to this lockdown. PM2.5 concentrations in nonattainment cities (NACs) in Uttar Pradesh and the Delhi-National Capital Region (NCR) in North India were studied. Data from prelockdown and the various lockdown phases were compared, with 2019 as a benchmark. Compared with those in 2019, the PM2.5 concentrations during lockdown Phase 1 were approximately 44.6% lower for cities in Uttar Pradesh and approximately 58.5% lower for the Delhi-NCR. The health impacts of particle inhalation were quantified using the multiple-path particle dosimetry and AirQ+ models, which revealed that the most considerable improvement was during lockdown Phase 1. Among the prelockdown and lockdown phases, Phase 1 exhibited the minimum PM2.5 concentration and thus the greatest health benefits. For the selected cities, the concentration of particle deposition in the tracheobronchial region of human lungs showed its maximum reduction during lockdown Phase 1(30.14%). Furthermore, the results highlighted a decrease of 29.85 deaths per 100,000 persons during lockdown Phase 1, primarily due to the reduction in PM2.5 concentrations. This quantification of the health benefits due to a decrease in PM2.5 may help policymakers implement suitable control measures, especially for NACs, where the respirable particulate matter concentrations remain very high. © 2021, AAGR Aerosol and Air Quality Research.

Understanding GSH metabolism is of vital importance for deciphering redox regulation in these microorganisms. In the present study, to better understand the GSH metabolism in filamentous fungi, we investigated functions of the dugB and dugC genes in the model fungus Aspergillus nidulans. These genes are orthologues of dug2 and dug3, which are involved in cytosolic GSH degradation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The deletion of dugB, dugC, or both resulted in a moderate increase in the GSH content in mycelia grown on glucose, reduced conidium production, and disturbed sexual development. In agreement with these observations, transcriptome data showed that genes encoding mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway elements (e.g., steC, sskB, hogA, and mkkA) or regulatory proteins of conidiogenesis and sexual differentiation (e.g., flbA, flbC, flbE, nosA, rosA, nsdC, and nsdD) were downregulated in the ΔdugB ΔdugC mutant. Deletion of dugB and/or dugC slowed the depletion of GSH pools during carbon starvation. It also reduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species and decreased autolytic cell wall degradation and enzyme secretion but increased sterigmatocystin formation. Transcriptome data demonstrated that enzyme secretions—in contrast to mycotoxin production—were controlled at the posttranscriptional level. We suggest that GSH connects starvation and redox regulation to each other: cells utilize GSH as a stored carbon source during starvation. The reduction of GSH content alters the redox state, activating regulatory pathways responsible for carbon starvation stress responses. IMPORTANCE Glutathione (GSH) is a widely distributed tripeptide in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes. Owing to its very low redox potential, antioxidative character, and high intracellular concentration, GSH profoundly shapes the redox status of cells. Our observations suggest that GSH metabolism and/or the redox status of cells plays a determinative role in several important aspects of fungal life, including oxidative stress defense, protein secretion, and secondary metabolite production (including mycotoxin formation), as well as sexual and asexual differentiations. We demonstrated that even a slightly elevated GSH level can substantially disturb the homeostasis of fungi. This information could be important for development of new GSH-producing strains or for any biotechnologically relevant processes where the GSH content, antioxidant capacity, or oxidative stress tolerance of a fungal strain is manipulated. © 2021 American Society for Microbiology.

Nevertheless, concerns have been raised regarding emission levels at the boundaries of ambient and driving conditions of the real-driving emissions (RDE) regulation. A Euro 6d-Temp GDI vehicle with a GPF was tested on the road and in the laboratory with cycles simulating congested urban traffic, dynamic driving, and towing a trailer uphill at 85% of maximum payload. The ambient temperatures covered a range from −30 to 50◦ C. The solid PN emissions were 10 times lower than the PN limit under most conditions and temperatures. Only dynamic driving that regenerated the filter passively, and for the next cycle resulted in relatively high emissions although they were still below the limit.

To diminish the adverse effect of excessive CO2 in the atmosphere, porous architectures with inimitable microstructural features have been developed for the purposes of capture and storage. However, a critical element for ecological balance is reducing waste. This has further encouraged the research community to utilise captured CO2, since it is a cheap industrial waste. In this review, we have illustrated the development of strategies for CO2 utilization with an emphasis on CO2 capture, particularly highlighting the production of valuable chemicals. Numerous approaches have been elicited for the conversion of CO2 into value-added chemicals, such as cyclic carbonates, alcohols, dimethyl ether, olefins, aromatics and many more. For such aforementioned conversions, research interest has covered metal oxides (silica, zeolite, alumina and transition metal oxide), porous polymers, metal organic frameworks (MOFs), zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs) and carbonaceous materials together with several metal NPs (NP). The most conventional state-of-the art strategy is immobilizing metallic or metal oxide NPs over porous networks, employing it as a catalyst for the production of agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals and fuels. The performance of the catalysts can be precisely tuned by morphological selectivity, surface area, thermal stability, elemental composition, mechanical inertness, ultra-fine porosity, etc. The efficiency of the catalyst has been further improved on the basis of yield of product, selectivity and reusability. This review demonstrates the latest tactics to fabricate different types of catalyst for CO2 fixation in order to achieve valuable chemicals with efficacy reaching towards commercial demand. In addition, future considerations to fabricate heterogeneous catalysts with microstructural diversity comprising potential active sites, are discussed, keeping an eye on the probable challenges in the context of transformation of CO2 to the value-added products. © 2021 The Royal Society of Chemistry.",,,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106569393

Here we examine the wintertime direct radiative perturbation due to BC with an efficiently modelled BC distribution over the IGP in a high-resolution (0.1 0.1) chemical transport model, CHIMERE, implementing new BC emission inventories. The model efficiency in simulating the observed BC distribution was assessed by executing five simulations: Constrained and bottomup (bottomup includes Smog, Cmip, Edgar, and Pku). These simulations respectively implement the recently estimated India-based observationally constrained BC emissions (Constrainedemiss) and the latest bottom-up BC emissions (India-based: Smog-India; global: Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 - CMIP6, Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research-V4 - EDGAR-V4, and Peking University BC Inventory - PKU). The mean BC emission flux from the five BC emission inventory databases was found to be considerably high (450- 1000 kg km2 yr1) over most of the IGP, with this being the highest (2500 kg km2 yr1) over megacities (Kolkata and Delhi). A low estimated value of the normalised mean bias (NMB) and root mean square error (RMSE) from the Constrained estimated BC concentration (NMB: 17 %) and aerosol optical depth due to BC (BC-AOD) (NMB: 11 %) indicated that simulations with Constrainedemiss BC emissions in CHIMERE could simulate the distribution of BC pollution over the IGP more efficiently than with bottom-up emissions. The high BC pollution covering the IGP region comprised a wintertime all-day (daytime) mean BC concentration and BC-AOD respectively in the range 14-25 ?gm3 (6- 8 ?gm3) and 0.04-0.08 ?gm3 from the Constrained simulation. The simulated BC concentration and BC-AOD were inferred to be primarily sensitive to the change in BC emission strength over most of the IGP (including the megacity of Kolkata), but also to the transport of BC aerosols over megacity Delhi. Five main hotspot locations were identified in and around Delhi (northern IGP), Prayagraj-Allahabad- Varanasi (central IGP), Patna-Palamu (upper, lower, and mideastern IGP), and Kolkata (eastern IGP). The wintertime direct radiative perturbation due to BC aerosols from the Constrained simulation estimated the atmospheric radiative warming (C30 to C50Wm2) to be about 50 %-70% larger than the surface cooling. A widespread enhancement in atmospheric radiative warming due to BC by 2-3 times and a reduction in surface cooling by 10 %-20 %, with net warming at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) of 10-15Wm2, were noticed compared to the atmosphere without BC, for which a net cooling at the TOA was exhibited. These perturbations were the strongest around megacities (Kolkata and Delhi), extended to the eastern coast, and were inferred to be 30 %-50% lower from the bottomup than the Constrained simulation. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

We can produce the biochar at all likely scales, ranging from the industrial to the domestic level and even at individual farms, thus, the biochar industry is leading as a most appropriate at different socioeconomic settings. The possibility of sustainable biochar production practices and multi-functionality features make it a promising candidate to fulfill an increasing demand in the fields of soil amendment, agricultural sustainability, environmental protection, cutting-edge materials, and to achieve circular bioeconomy and mitigation of climate change. An available fraction of waste biomass (agroforestry waste, biomass crops, agricultural residues, mill residues, and animal manure, and many more) can be used efficiently in pyrolysis and converted into desired biochar materials, besides this alternative energy products, such as syngas, bio-oil, electricity generation, and process heat. This report emphasizes the fate of biomass composition, pyrolysis mechanisms, and applications of modern analytical and characterization techniques that are being adopted, applied, and standardized to improve understandings of molecular, structural, and surface properties characteristics of biochar. To achieve precisely designed biochar, there is a need to understand the latest advances in biochar materialization mechanisms and structure-application relationships to speed up their agronomic applications and to achieve a zero-waste dream. This report also summarizes a wide range of literature published on feedstocks, pyrolysis, and biochar and suggests several practical recommendations appropriate to implement and bring together specific details on the thermochemical conversion of biomass, desired biochar properties, organic and inorganic phases, and the significance to the agronomic applications. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agronomic applications; Biochar properties; Biomass feedstocks; Carbon sequestration; Pyrolysis mechanisms","Agricultural wastes; Agronomy; Climate change; Feedstocks; Fertilizers; Physicochemical properties; Porous materials; Pyrolysis; Soils; Sustainable development; Agronomic application; Bio chars; Biochar property; Biomass feedstock; Carbon sequestration; Property; Pyrolysis mechanism; Speed up; Thermochemical Conversion; Waste biomass; Biomass",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102872770

Moreover, farmersʼ adaptation process under changing climate can be explained by the psychological factors and the incorporation of socio-environmental background. Therefore, the current study aimed at socio-cognitive perceptions and extended protection motivation theory (PMT) as the basis. This paper estimated the influence of cognitive factors on individualsʼ views and decisions regarding climate change adaptation. Data from this study came from a survey with 245 rural farmers in temperate mount areas of Fars province, Iran. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to estimate the different factors. Results showed that three core elements of the theory, namely, risk evaluation, adaptation evaluation, and maladaptation, were the statistically significant factors that could directly explain farmersʼ adaptation decisions to adopt appropriate coping strategies under changing climate. Findings also suggested that another structural factor, adaptation incentives, had a statistically significant influence on adaptation decision-making among farmers. The study proposed valuable insights on social discourse to promote adaptation. Findings strongly offered that social discourse should focus more strongly on confirming the truth and timeliness of information that individuals gained. Eventually, further investigations are necessary to conduct the measurement model in other cultures and geographical areas and see how socio-environmental components can influence risk evaluation and adaptation evaluation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Coping strategies; Maladaptation; Protection motivation theory; Structural equation modeling; Temperate mount areas","Agricultural robots; Agriculture; Decision making; Risk assessment; Adaptation decisions; Adaptation process; Agricultural sector; Climate change adaptation; Protection motivation theory; Psychological factors; Structural equation modeling; Structural factor; Climate change; adaptive management; agroindustry; climate change; coping strategy; spatiotemporal analysis; Fars; Iran",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105281239

Here, we consider whether temporal orientation might act as a boundary condition for age effects on climate change engagement. We assess whether cultural (study 1) and inter-individual (study 2) differences in temporal orientation moderate the tendency for older adults to be less engaged with climate change than younger adults. Study 1 (N = 44,387) reveals that among European countries, countries with a greater long-term orientation tend to show a weaker (i.e., less negative) relationship between age and the salience of climate change (i.e., cognitive engagement with the topic). Study 2 (N = 798) demonstrates that in the USA, the negative relationship between age and climate action intentions becomes smaller in magnitude (i.e., less negative) among those higher in consideration of future consequences, but increases in those higher in consideration of immediate consequences. These findings support the notion that it is a confluence of age and present orientation (and low future orientation) that that drives age-related declines in climate engagement. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Age; Climate change engagement; Consideration of future consequences; Socioemotional selectivity theory; Temporal orientation","Climate models; Action intentions; Age effects; Age-related; Cultural variability; European Countries; Future orientations; Long-term orientation; Older adults; Climate change; adult; boundary condition; climate change; nature-society relations; young population; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105587048

Grand Canyon National Park (GCNP), Arizona, in particular, was the site of many early air quality studies that found that before 1990 particulate sulfate was the largest contributor to light extinction at GCNP. Since a peak in the 1960s, sulfate concentrations at GCNP have declined dramatically as sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions in the southwestern United States and northern Mexico have been reduced, often due to successful regulations. The relative importance of upwind source regions has also changed. During the 1960s and 1970s the predominant SO2 emitters were copper smelters in Arizona and surrounding states. As smelter emissions declined, in the 1980s and 1990s electric generating units (EGUs) became the largest upwind SO2 sources. More recently, EGU emissions have also been reduced, especially since about 2000. Three back trajectory methods are used to examine the sulfate concentrations at GCNP as a function of upwind source regions. 1) Residence time analysis shows that Arizona, southern California, southern Utah, and northern Mexico are most often upwind of GCNP. There were highly significant reductions in mean sulfate concentrations at GCNP when air arrived after transport through most source regions. 2) Concentration trends by source region show that the maximum rates of decline for 1980–2018 were about −2%/year when there was transport through Colorado and the Navajo Generating Station (NGS) source regions. 3) The Trajectory Mass Balance (TrMB) model was used to apportion sulfate seasonally for 3-year rolling averages during 1981–2017. As expected, relative source attributions have evolved through time. Largest mean contributors in summer are northern Mexico (25–70%), Baja (0–25%), Arizona smelters (0–35%), the Mohave Generating Station (&lt;10–18%) and Southern California (1–15%). During winter the Navajo Generating Station (10–25%) and Cholla (3–12%) often contributed the largest fractions. Mean concentrations are much lower, and there are larger fractional declines in contributions from many source areas during winter as compared to summer. These analyses document the successful outcomes that can result from effective regulations. © 2021","1990 Clean Air Act Amendments; Back trajectory analysis; Grand Canyon National Park; Sulfate trends; Visibility","Air quality; Light extinction; Parks; Sulfur dioxide; Visibility; 1990 clean air act amendment; Arizona; Back trajectory analysis; Grand Canyon National Park; Me-xico; Particulate sulfates; SO$-2$; Source region; Sulfate concentrations; Sulphate trend; Trajectories; copper; sulfate; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; air quality; copper; long-term change; numerical model; sulfate; sulfur; sulfur dioxide; summer; trajectory; trend analysis; air pollution control; air quality; Arizona; Article; batch process; Colorado; comparative study; exhaust gas; meteorology; national park; Nevada; New Mexico; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; summer; trend study; Utah; visibility; winter; Arizona; Grand Canyon National Park; United States; Utah; Opuntia imbricata",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103796458

Impacts of restricted onshore wind potential and transmission expansion are considered. Optimisation of the capacity development and operation of the energy system towards 2050 is performed with the energy system model Balmorel. Generation, storage, transmission expansion, district heating, carbon capture and storage, and synthetic gas units compete with each other. The results show how sector coupling leads to a change of paradigm: The electricity system moves from a system where generation adapts to inflexible demand, to a system where flexible demand adapts to variable generation. Sector coupling increases electricity demand, variable renewable energy, heat storage capacity, and electricity and district heating transmission expansion towards 2050. Non-restricted investments in onshore wind and electricity transmission reduce emissions and costs considerably (especially with high sector coupling) with savings of 78.7€2016/person/year. Investments in electric power-to-heat units are key to reduce costs and emissions in the heat sector. The scenarios with the highest sector coupling achieve the highest emission reduction by 2045: 76% greenhouse gases reduction with respect to 1990 levels, which highlights the value of sector coupling to achieve the green transition. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Energy system; Flexibility; Green transition; Modelling; Optimisation; Sector coupling","Carbon capture; Cost reduction; District heating; Emission control; Expansion; Greenhouse gases; Heat storage; Transmissions; Capacity development; Electricity demands; Electricity transmission; Energy system model; Heat storage capacity; Transmission expansion; Variable generations; Variable renewable energies; Investments; cost analysis; electrical power; electricity; emission control; green economy; greenhouse gas; heating; spatiotemporal analysis; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101658308

However, with the rapid development of modern agriculture, air pollution caused by agricultural activities is becoming more and more serious. Agricultural activities can generate a large amount of air pollutants, such as ammonia, methane, nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds, and persistent organic pollutants, the sources of which mainly include farmland fertilization, livestock breeding, pesticide use, agricultural residue burning, agricultural machinery, and agricultural irrigation. Greenhouse gases emitted by agricultural activities can affect regional climate change, while atmospheric particulates and persistent organic pollutants can even seriously harm the health of surrounding residents. With the increasing threat of agricultural air pollution, more and more relevant studies have been carried out, as well as some recommendations for reducing emissions. The emissions of ammonia and greenhouse gases can be significantly reduced by adopting reasonable fertilization methods, scientific soil management, and advanced manure treatment systems. Regarding pesticide use and agricultural residues burning, emission reduction are more dependent on the restriction and support of government regulations, such as banning certain pesticides, prohibiting open burning of straw, and supporting the recycling and reuse of residues. This review, summarizing the relevant research in the past decade, discusses the current situation, health effects, and emission reduction measures of agricultural air pollutants from different sources, in order to provide some help for follow-up research. © 2021 by the authors.

As one of the world's largest energy consumers and carbon emitters, China needs to attach great importance to low-carbon energy development, and address major environmental issues such as ecological destruction and climate warming. In the process of energy low-carbon development, Fujian Province is faced with a series of challenges in terms of energy structure, social and economic development, capital and technology, etc. However, at the same time, Fujian Province in China also has opportunities to develop energy low-carbon in terms of emission reduction space and rich forest resources. This paper firstly describes the energy consumption situation in Fujian Province and emphasizes the necessity of using low-carbon energy, then analyzes the energy structure of Fujian Province and the relationship between low carbon development and the adjustment of industrial structure in Fujian Province. Finally, this paper proposes that Fujian Province should make use of the advantages of renewable resources to develop a reasonable low-carbon energy development strategy. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","Carbon Emission; Energy Consumption; Fujian Province; Low-carbon Energy","Carbon; Climate change; Emission control; Energy utilization; Planning; Sustainable development; Emission reduction; Environmental issues; Environmental problems; Global climate changes; Industrial structures; Low carbon energies; Low-carbon development; Social and economic development; Economic and social effects",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107947636

In this context, CO2RR has become an emerging research focus in the field of electrocatalysis over the past decade. While a large number of nanostructured catalysts have been developed to accelerate CO2RR, the tradeoff between activity and selectivity usually renders the overall electrocatalytic performance very poor. Beyond catalyst design, rationally designing electrolyzers is also of substantial importance for improving the CO2RR performance and achieving its scale-up for practical applications. To a large extent, the electrolyzer configuration determines the local reaction environment near an electrode by affecting the process conditions, thereby resulting in remarkably different electrocatalytic performances. To be techno-economically viable, the performance of CO2 electrolyzers is expected to be at least comparable to that of the current state-of-the-art proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolyzers, with regard to their activity, selectivity, and stability. Researchers have made great progress in the development of CO2 electrolyzers over the past few years, but they are also facing many issues and challenges. This review aims to provide an in-depth analysis of the research progress and status of current CO2 electrolyzers including H-cell, flow-cell, and membrane electrode assembly cell (MEA-cell) electrolyzers. Herein, operation at industrial current densities (&gt; 200 mA·cm−2) is set as a basis when these electrolyzers are discussed and compared in terms of the four main figures of merit (current density, Faradic efficiency, energy efficiency and stability) that describe the CO2RR performance of an electrolyzer. The advantages and drawbacks of each electrolyzer are discussed and highlighted with emphasis on the key achievements reported to date. Compared to conventional H-cell electrolyzers that work well in mechanistic studies, the newly developed electrolyzers using gas diffusion electrodes, both flow-cell and MEA-cell electrolyzers, are able to break the limitation of CO2 solubility in water and acquire industrial current densities. Although flow-cell electrolyzers have achieved current densities exceeding 1 A·cm−2, they suffer from low energy efficiencies because of the significant iR drop and poor stability owing to the use of alkaline electrolytes. These issues can be overcome in the case of zero-gap MEA-cell electrolyzers with ion exchange membranes being as solid electrolytes. The anion exchange membrane (AEM)-based CO2 electrolyzers are at the center of the current research, as they demonstrate promising activity and selectivity toward specific CO2RR products and exhibit excellent stability for over thousands of hours in few cases. Meanwhile, the crossover of CO2 and liquid products from the cathode to the anode through the membrane tends to lower the utilization efficiency of the CO2 supplied to the AEM electrolyzers. MEA-cell electrolyzers using cation exchange membranes and bipolar membranes have also been explored; however, neither of them have shown satisfactory CO2RR performance. The development of new polymer electrolyte membranes and ionomers would help address these problems. While issues and challenges still exist, MEA-cell electrolyzers hold the greatest promise for practical applications. As concluding remarks, research strategies and opportunities for the future have been proposed to accelerate the development of CO2RR technology for practical applications and to deepen the mechanistic understanding behind improved performance. This review provides new insights into rational electrolyzer design and guidelines for researchers in this field. © Editorial office of Acta Physico-Chimica Sinica.","CO2 electrolyzers; Electrocatalytic reduction; Energy efficiency; Flow cell; Industrial current density; Membrane electrode assembly",,Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107454860

For countries and enterprises, achieving emission reduction targets in the process of economic growth, meaning a decoupling between carbon emissions and economic growth, is the best developing path under low-carbon economy. China has pledged at the 75th session of the United Nations General Assembly to achieve carbon neutral by 2060. How challenging is it to meet this commitment while sustain the social-economic development? In this study, we apply the Tapio decoupling model to analyze the decoupling status of provincial carbon emissions from its economic development; and combine the Logarithmic Mean Divisia Index model with the Cobb-Douglas production function to study the emission driving force, especially from economic perspective. Results show that emissions in most provinces have been weakly decoupled from economic development, and the latter drove emissions mainly via capital investment and total factor productivity. We further decompose the emissions-economy decoupling into the decoupling between CO2 emissions and energy consumption, as well as the decoupling between the energy consumption and economic development. Our results indicate that the emissions-economy decoupling has been primarily depending on the decoupling of economic activities from energy consumption during the study period. Substantial variation exists in provincial emissions and its driving forces, however, the emissions-economy decoupling trend tends to converge as one club, suggesting more or less coherent low-carbon progress across the provinces. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Club convergence; CO2 emissions; LMDI decomposition; Tapio decoupling","Carbon; Economic and social effects; Economics; Emission control; Energy utilization; Investments; Renewable energy resources; Carbon emissions; Club convergence; CO$-2$/ emission; Decouplings; Driving forces; Economic development; Economic growths; Energy-consumption; LMDI decomposition; Tapio decoupling; Carbon dioxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102598571

In this study, we compare the well-to-wheels (WTW) greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensities of PEVs with those of gasoline vehicles at the provincial level in the year 2017 by considering the heterogeneity in the consumption-based electricity mix and climate impacts on vehicle fuel economy. Results show a high variation of provincial WTW GHG emission intensities for battery electric vehicles (BEVs, 22-293 g CO2eq/km) and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs, 82-298 g CO2eq/km) in contrast to gasoline internal combustion engine vehicles (ICEVs, 227-245 g CO2eq/km) and gasoline hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs, 141-164 g CO2eq/km). Due to the GHG-intensive coal-based electricity and cold weather, WTW GHG emission intensities of BEVs and PHEVs are higher than those of gasoline ICEVs in seven and ten northern provinces in China, respectively. WTW GHG emission intensities of gasoline HEVs, on the other hand, are lower in 18 and 26 provinces than those of BEVs and PHEVs, respectively. The analysis suggests that province-specific PEV and electric grid development policies should be considered for GHG emission reductions of on-road transportation in China. ©","China; electric vehicle; gasoline vehicle; greenhouse gas; interprovincial electricity transmission; temperature effect; well-to-wheels life-cycle analysis","Battery electric vehicles; Coal combustion; Emission control; Fuel economy; Gas emissions; Gasoline; Greenhouse gases; Plug-in electric vehicles; Vehicle-to-grid; Climate impacts; Development policies; Gasoline vehicle; Internal combustion engine vehicles; Market penetration; Plug in hybrid electric vehicles; Road transportation; Vehicle fuel economy; Plug-in hybrid vehicles; carbon dioxide; gasoline; methane; natural gas; nitrous oxide; petroleum; gasoline; comparative study; electric vehicle; electricity generation; greenhouse gas; Article; carbon footprint; China; cold exposure; comparative study; degradation; electricity; energy consumption; environmental policy; environmental temperature; exhaust gas; greenhouse effect; hybrid; hydropower; pollution monitoring; reduction (chemistry); sensitivity analysis; sustainable development; traffic and transport; electricity; exhaust gas; greenhouse gas; motor vehicle; China; China; Electricity; Gasoline; Greenhouse Effect; Greenhouse Gases; Motor Vehicles; Vehicle Emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106532980

Climate changes—which will affect species distribution—may even amplify the problems caused by invasive species. Here, we used ecological niche models to evaluate the current and future distribution of 108 invasive plants in the entire Brazilian territory and the country's conservation unit facilities (CUFs). Overall, our results did not indicate a significant change in the potential distribution of invasive plants between the current and future climate scenarios, although we expect that 67.5% of the species will decrease its range in Brazil in the future. The proportion of the plants' invasive range inside conservation units varied from 1 to 12%, and results suggest that this would not increase or decrease in the future. Taken together, our results do not indicate that climate change will amplify the effects of existing invasive plants—although it may facilitate the invasion of other species. Both current and future scenarios suggest high suitability for invasive plants in the southern, southern, southeastern, and eastern coast of Brazil, comprising the Caatinga, Cerrado, and Mata Atlântica Brazilian biomes, the most populated areas of the country. We advise that conservation unit managers and authorities within these regions should continuously monitor such invasive plants to take early responses to avoid their establishment. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG part of Springer Nature.","Bioinvasions; Ecological niche models; Invasive plants; Invasive species","biodiversity; climate change; conservation status; detection method; invasive species; native species; reproduction; Brazil; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100167841

While several studies have demonstrated that decorator worm tubes are hotspots of biogeochemical activity (i.e., nitrogen and sulfur cycling), it is still largely unclear whether the tube microbiome differs compositionally from the surrounding sediment and what distinct functional processes tube microbiomes may have. To address these unknowns, this study analyzed the bacterial communities of D. cuprea tubes and surrounding sediments using high-throughput 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Tubes and sediments were sampled at three sites along an anthropogenic stress gradient within the Newport River Estuary to also assess geographic variation of tube microbiomes and the possible influence of human disturbance. We found a clear distinction in the microbial community composition and diversity between tubes and surrounding sediment. Tube microbiomes were significantly enriched for the phyla Bacteriodetes, Actinobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, Deferribacteres, Latescibacteria, and Lentisphaerae. Chloroplast sequences of macroalgae and grass species were consistently abundant in tubes and nearly absent in surrounding sediment. Functional annotation of prokaryotic taxa (FAPROTAX)-based functional predictions suggested that tube microbiomes have higher potentials for aerobic chemoheterotrophy, sulfur compound respiration, nitrate reduction, methylotrophy, and hydrocarbon degradation than surrounding sediments. Tube microbiomes vary across sites, though dissimilarity is comparatively low compared to tube-to-sediment differences. Contrary to our hypothesis, the tubes at the most highly impacted site had the highest microbial diversity [i.e., amplicon sequence variant (ASV) richness and Shannon’s diversity], yet tubes from the medium impacted site actually had the lowest microbial diversity. Our findings show that D. cuprea tubes support a microbiome that is significantly distinct in composition and function from the surrounding sediment. Diopatra cuprea tubes appear to create unique microhabitats that facilitate numerous microbially-mediated biogeochemical processes in the marine benthic environment. © Copyright © 2021 Fuirst, Ward, Schwaner, Diana, Schultz and Rittschof.","biogeochemistry; Diopatra cuprea; microbial function; microbiome; polychaete; tube worm",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107739521

The temporal fidelity of plant wax records, however, can be up to several thousand years older than the corresponding sediment, based on compound-specific radiocarbon (14C) analysis. Unfortunately, the factors controlling 14C age offsets between plant waxes and sediments are not well understood. The aims of this study are to quantify and compare plant wax n-alkane 14C age offsets among lakes within the same region, and to determine if drainage and lake basin differences (e.g., size, relief, drainage basin morphology, fluvial inputs) influence these offsets. We collected sediments from five lakes in the Adirondack Mountains, NY, USA that lack petrogenic sources of n-alkanes, and range in drainage basin characteristics. Sediment age models were constructed for each lake using a combination of sediment 210Pb, 137Cs, and macrofossil 14C ages, and compared to 14C ages of long-chain (n-C27, n-C29, n-C31) alkanes sampled from Holocene and Late Glacial aged sediments. The n-alkane 14C ageinitial is a measure of the age offset in n-alkanes relative to the sediment they are deposited in. Across all lakes, the n-alkane 14C ageinitial ranged from penecontemporaneous to 2440 14C yr. This oldest n-alkane 14C ageinitial is significantly outside the distribution of all other samples; when excluded, the overall mean n-alkane 14C ageinitial was 400 ± 255 14C yr (n = 23). The largest n-alkane 14C ageinitial values were observed in the last 1 cal kyr BP (565 ± 180 14C yr (1σ), n = 12)) compared to sediments deposited between 1 and 13 cal kyr BP (220 ± 195 14C yr (1σ), n = 11)). These age offsets develop early after initial lake basin sedimentation and follow a similar pattern in all of the lakes despite differences in lake basin and catchment size, relief, and geomorphology. We speculate that 14C age offsets occur due to reworking of older n-alkanes stored in drainage basin sediments and soils and this mechanism is most effective in the last ∼1 kyr. Regardless, lakes in temperate forested metamorphic bedrock terrains have relatively small and stable n-alkane age offsets compared with lakes with extensive catchment soils or anthropogenic disturbance. By targeting lakes with minimal catchment soils, age offsets may be reduced, thereby minimizing attenuation or age distortion of climate signals in plant wax isotopic records. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon storage; Forests; Plant biomarkers; Radiocarbon; Soils; Temperate lakes; Terrestrial carbon","alkane; bedrock; biomarker; carbon storage; lacustrine deposit; radiocarbon dating; sedimentation; temperate environment",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102585705

Here, we examined the influence of climate variables, plant morphology, and the abundance of aquatic invertebrates on the microbial biodiversity of the northern pitcher plant Sarracenia purpurea. The plant's cup-shaped leaves fill with rainwater and support a miniature, yet full-fledged, ecosystem with a diverse microbiome that decomposes captured prey and a small network of shredding and filter-feeding aquatic invertebrates that feed on microbes. We characterized pitcher microbiomes of 108 plants sampled at 36 sites from Florida to Quebec. Structural equation models revealed that annual precipitation and temperature, plant size, and midge abundance had direct effects on microbiome taxonomic and phylogenetic diversity. Climate variables also exerted indirect effects through plant size and midge abundance. Further, spatial structure and climate influenced taxonomic composition, but not phylogenetic composition. Our results suggest that direct effects of midge abundance and climate and indirect effects of climate through its effect on plant-associated factors lead to greater richness of microbial phylotypes in warmer, wetter sites. © 2021 by the Ecological Society of America","bacteria; biogeography; food webs; phylogenetic diversity; Sarracenia purpurea","biodiversity; carnivorous plant; habitat structure; host-pathogen interaction; microbial activity; phylogenetics; rainwater; species richness; taxonomy; trophic level; Canada; Florida [United States]; Quebec [Canada]; United States; Florida; Invertebrata; Sarracenia purpurea; ecosystem; Florida; food chain; microflora; organismal interaction; phylogeny; Quebec; Sarraceniaceae; Ecosystem; Florida; Food Chain; Microbial Interactions; Microbiota; Phylogeny; Quebec; Sarraceniaceae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102868624

However, the magnitude of these effects on the contemporary and future terrestrial carbon balance is insufficiently understood. Here, we apply an extended version of the O-CN terrestrial biosphere model that simulates the atmosphere to canopy transport of O3, its surface and stomatal uptake, the O3-induced leaf injury, and the coupled terrestrial carbon and nitrogen cycles. We use this model to simulate past and future impacts of air pollution against a background of concurrent changes in climate and carbon dioxide concentrations (CO2) for two contrasting representative concentration pathway (RCP) scenarios (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). The simulations show that O3-related damage considerably reduced northern hemispheric gross primary production (GPP) and long-term carbon storage between 1850 and the 2010s. The simulated O3effect on GPP in the Northern Hemisphere peaked towards the end of the 20th century, with reductions of 4 %, causing a reduction in the northern hemispheric carbon sink of 0.4 PgCyr..1. During the 21st century, O3-induced reductions in GPP and carbon storage are projected to decline, through a combination of direct air pollution control methods that reduce near-surface O3and the indirect effects of rising atmospheric CO2, which reduces stomatal uptake of O3concurrent with increases of leaf-level water use efficiency. However, in hot spot regions such as East Asia, the model simulations suggest a sustained decrease in GPP by more than 8% throughout the 21st century. O3exposure reduces projected carbon storage at the end of the 21st century by up to 15%in parts of Europe, the US, and East Asia. Our simulations suggest that the stimulating effect of nitrogen deposition on regional GPP and carbon storage is lower in magnitude compared to the detrimental effect of O3during most of the simulation period for both RCPs. In the second half of the 21st century, the detrimental effect of O3on GPP is outweighed by nitrogen deposition, but the effect of nitrogen deposition on land carbon storage remains lower than the effect of O3. Accounting for the stimulating effects of nitrogen deposition but omitting the detrimental effect of O3may lead to an overestimation of projected carbon uptake and storage. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

The prohibitively large computational cost of estimating thermal energy demand based on district- and urban-scale energy simulations is a major barrier to the wide-scale use of modeling in design and operation of district energy networks and in feasibility studies of technologies such as thermal energy storage. In this paper, a simple, computationally efficient modelling approach is proposed where operational data from the district energy network is used to construct temporal load profiles and thereby eliminate the need for building energy simulations. The proposed model is validated against data from a newly developed natural-gas powered district energy network in British Columbia, Canada. The utility of this data-driven approach is demonstrated through case studies on the feasibility and effectiveness of hourly thermal energy storage. It is shown that hourly thermal energy storage in a water tank can reduce the daily peak loads on the boilers by as much as 20%. Furthermore, using thermal energy storage, the highly fluctuating demand can be met with a constant-power supply, which would facilitate the use of biomass as an alternative energy source. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Data-driven model; District energy network; Simulink; Thermal energy storage","Digital storage; Emission control; Heat storage; Thermal energy; Water tanks; Alternative energy source; British Columbia , Canada; Building energy simulations; Computationally efficient; Data driven modelling; Data-driven approach; Design and operations; Energy and emissions; Energy efficiency",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098067127

Unprecedented levels of destruction need renewed focus on addressing and protecting communities forcing the decision makers to change their attention to vulnerability and risk assessment. In particular, society and economy rely heavily on infrastructures, as fundamental links for movement of goods and people, and are extremely vulnerable to multiple hazards (such as droughts, floods, storms, and coastal hazards). In this regard, resilience quantifies the recovery time and procedures to facilitate and enhance pre-hazard and post-hazard event mitigation and emergency response strategies of systems and entire communities. Resilience calculation depends on two important contributions: loss and recovery models that need to consider the effects of climate change.

Three ventilation strategies, including mixing ventilation (MV), displacement ventilation (DV) and stratum ventilation (SV) were applied to medium-sized air-conditioned space with this approach. The trend of the results for three ventilation systems in the life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost (LCC) analysis is SV &lt; DV &lt; MV. The result of CO2 emission and regional LCC shows that SV is the lowest one in both regional studies.

While in their present status, the spectroscopic databases provide only electric-dipole (E1) transitions for polyatomic molecules (H2O, CO2, N2O, CH4, O3…), the possible impact of weak E2 and M1 bands to the modeling of the Earth and planetary atmospheres has to be addressed. This is especially important in the case of carbon dioxide for which E2 and M1 bands may be located in spectral windows of weak E1 absorption. In the present work, a high sensitivity absorption spectrum of CO2 is recorded by Optical-Feedback-Cavity Enhanced Absorption Spectroscopy (OFCEAS) in the 3.3 µm transparency window of carbon dioxide. The studied spectral interval corresponds to the region where M1 transitions of the ν2+ν3 band of carbon dioxide were recently identified in the spectrum of the Martian atmosphere. Here, both M1 and E2 transitions of the ν2+ν3 band are detected by OFCEAS. Using recent ab initio calculations of the E2 spectrum of 12C16O2, intensity measurements of five M1 lines and three E2 lines allow us to disentangle the M1 and E2 contributions. Indeed, E2 intensity values (on the order of a few 10–29 cm/molecule) are found in reasonable agreement with ab initio calculations while the intensity of the M1 lines (including an E2 contribution) agree very well with recent very long path measurements by Fourier Transform spectroscopy. We thus conclude that both E2 and M1 transitions should be systematically incorporated in the CO2 line list provided by spectroscopic databases. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon dioxide; CO2; Electric quadrupole; Magnetic dipole; OFCEAS","Absorption spectroscopy; Calculations; Carbon dioxide; Molecular spectroscopy; Ab initio calculations; Cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy; Electric magnetic; Electric quadrupoles; Feedback cavity; Magnetic dipole; Optical-; Optical-feedback-cavity enhanced absorption spectroscopy; Spectra's; Spectroscopic database; Magnetism; absorption spectrum; atomic absorption spectroscopy; carbon dioxide; Fourier transform; magnetic anomaly; radiative forcing; sensitivity analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102132219

They contribute to carbon lock-in and may hinder a rapid decarbonization of energy systems. Here we provide a systematic map of the literature on carbon lock-in induced by LLCS. Based on a structured search of the Web of Science and Scopus, we identified 226 publications from 38 095 search results using a supervised machine learning approach. We show biases toward power generation and toward developed countries. We also identify 11 indicators used to quantify carbon lock-in. Quantifications of committed emissions (cumulative emissions that would occur over the remaining operational lifetime of an asset) or stranded assets (premature retirement/retrofitting or under-utilization of assets along a given pathway) are the most commonly used metrics, whereas institutional indicators are scarcely represented. The synthesis of quantifications shows that (i) global committed emissions have slightly increased over time, (ii) coal power plants are a major source of committed emissions and are exposed to risk of becoming stranded, (iii) delayed mitigation action increases stranded assets and (iv) sectoral distribution and amount of stranded assets differ between countries. A thematic analysis of policy implications highlights the need to assure stability and legitimacy of climate policies and to enable coordination between stakeholders. Carbon pricing is one of the most cited policy instrument, but the literature emphasizes that it should not be the only instrument used and should instead be complemented with other policy instruments, such as technical regulations and financial support for low carbon capital deployment. Further research is warranted on urban-scale, in developing countries and outside the electricity generation sector, notably on buildings, where stranded assets could be high. © 2021 The Author(s).

In this regard, a hybrid Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) approach was employed to prioritize appropriate biomass resources for biofuel production. Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS), Additive Ratio Assessment (ARAS), and Weighted Aggregates Sum Product Assessment (WASPAS) were the employed MCDM approaches. Subsequently, ranking aggregation methods, i.e., Borda, Copeland, and Rank Mean, were applied to integrate the rankings obtained from the MCDM approaches. Guilan province of Iran was selected as a case study based on its promising potential for biofuel production from first-, second-, and third-generation biofuel resources. Initially, through an in-depth review of the literature and the use of academic professors' expert opinions, ten criteria were selected as the evaluation indices of the study: 1) creating technical side jobs, 2) preserving non-renewable energy resources, 3) relative advantage of biofuel production, 4) complexity of biofuel production process, 5) cost of the biomass conversion process, 6) biomass reusability, 7) cost of biomass supply, 8) environmental impacts of biomass accumulation, 9) adaptability of the biofuel production process to the size of biomass production units and the attitude and knowledge of the producers, and 10) energy self-sufficiency of the biomass producer. Moreover, the 11 investigated potential sources of biofuel production were rice, peanut, livestock and poultry wastes, rice waste, peanut waste, tea residues and its processing wastes, olive residues and its processing wastes, livestock and poultry slaughter and farm-raised fish wastes, municipal solid waste and sewage, forest and wood farming wastes, algae and Azolla. The results indicated that “municipal solid wastes and sewage”, “forest and wood farming wastes” and “livestock and poultry wastes” from the second-generation biofuels were identified as the most important biomass resources in the studied area. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biofuel; Biomass; Renewable; Waste to energy","Bioconversion; Biofuels; Biomass; Decision making; Forestry; Greenhouse gases; Oilseeds; Reusability; Sewage; Tea; Biomass accumulation; Biomass conversion process; Biomass productions; Energy self-sufficiency; Greenhouse gas mitigation; Multi-criteria decision making; Non-renewable energy resources; Technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solutions; Municipal solid waste; biofuel; biofuel; alternative energy; biofuel; decision making; greenhouse gas; multicriteria analysis; Additive Ratio Assessment; agro-industrial waste; alga; Article; attitude; biofuel production; biomass conversion; biomass reusability; controlled study; cost; energy resource; environmental impact; fish; forest; Iran; livestock; multicriteria decision analysis; municipal solid waste; olive; peanut; poultry; priority journal; renewable energy; rice; rural area; sewage; slaughterhouse waste; tea; technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution; Weighted Aggregates SumProduct Assessment; wood; biomass; greenhouse gas; solid waste; Arachis hypogaea; Azolla; Biofuels; Biomass; Greenhouse Gases; Iran; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099863725

Protected areas might provide sanctuaries especially for sessile riparian plant species, but these niches are not always persistent over time. Objectives: We investigate if plant species of floodplain forests are provided with suitable habitat within currently protected areas and if these refugia persist. A coupled-modelling approach is used to gain spatially explicit information on new areas for sanctuaries. Methods: We use species distribution models to predict the niche of 12 Salicion albae and 7 Fraxinion floodplain forest species along rivers in Switzerland, under current, moderate and extreme climate change scenarios up to 80 years to the future (2100). The spread of plant species from current habitat to suitable future habitat is simulated using dispersal vectors and life history traits. Results: Salicion albae species are more flexible under both climate change scenarios than Fraxinion species. The main limitation for the spread of species is their dispersal ability, as only a minority of the suitable cells is colonized during the simulation process. The predicted future presence within currently protected areas decreases under both climate change scenarios in the model. Conclusions: Current protected floodplains do not provide persistent refugia for the plants studied, but might still be of importance to other organisms. Planning of sanctuaries for riparian plant species and communities need to focus on connectivity along rivers to maintain viable source populations in dynamic riverine landscapes under changing climate. © 2021, The Author(s).","Climate change; Colonization; Dispersal; Floodplain forests; Riparia; Species distribution model (SDM)","climate change; dicotyledon; dispersal; ecological modeling; floodplain forest; landscape planning; life history trait; protected area; riparian forest; Switzerland; Riparia; Riparia riparia; Riparia riparia riparia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103168145

Many objective causes hindering the comparison of economic characteristics of the considered coal gasification technologies are outlined. The energy and economic efficiencies of producing synthesis gas (syngas) from coal are estimated. The factors having the most pronounced effect on the efficiency, such as gasifier type, specific oxygen consumption, and initial fuel cost, are found. According to the calculations, the cost of produced syngas is two to three times higher than the price of natural gas for consumers. Therefore, the use of syngas and hydrogen produced from it for the centralized generation of power and heat will not be economically feasible in the foreseeable future. Integrated gasification combined cycle (IGCC) units are still not competitive with conventional coal-fired power plants, basically due to high specific capital expenditures, which are responsible for more than 2/3 of the price of delivered electricity. The issues of economic competition for hydrogen production from coal using alternative production processes are discussed in detail. It is demonstrated that hydrogen produced from cheap local coals (in Russia, these are coals from large coal deposits in Siberia and the Far East) can win the competition with hydrogen from natural gas. Nevertheless, activities should be continued to improve coal gasification processes and associated technologies, first of all, oxygen production technologies, to cut down capital and operating expenditures. Further development of coal chemical technologies involves high risks associated with the new global climate policy aimed at a drastic decrease in CO2 emissions and the replacement of fossil fuels in the global fuel and energy balance by renewable energy sources. State support for the development of new coal technologies and for coal chemistry science is necessary to retain the domestic coal industry. © 2021, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","coal; coal gasification; energy efficiency; gasifier; hydrogen; integrated gasification combined-cycle unit; syngas; syngas/hydrogen production cost","Coal; Coal deposits; Coal gasification; Coal gasification plants; Combined cycle power plants; Costs; Economic geology; Fossil fuel power plants; Hydrogen production; Natural gas; Natural gas deposits; Natural gasoline plants; Oxygen; Renewable energy resources; Synthesis gas; Capital expenditures; Centralized generation; Coal-fired power plant; Economic characteristics; Gasification technologies; Integrated gasification combined cycle; Renewable energy source; Synthesis gasses (syngas); Coal industry",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106340440

Through a series of detailed case studies, this book uncovers the promise and tensions of a new wave of resilient communities in Europe (Copenhagen, Rotterdam, and London), and the United States (New Orleans and South Florida). In addition, best practice projects in Amsterdam, Barcelona, Delft, Utrecht, and Vancouver are examined. The authors highlight how these communities are reinventing the role of streets and connecting public spaces in adapting to and mitigating climate change through green/blue infrastructure planning, maintaining and enhancing sustainable transportation options, and struggling to ensure equitable development for all residents. The case studies demonstrate that while there are some more universal aspects to encouraging adaptation urbanism, there are also important local characteristics that need to be both acknowledged and celebrated to help local communities thrive in the era of climate change. The book also provides key policy lessons and a roadmap for future research in adaptation urbanism. Advancing resilience policy discourse through multidisciplinary framework this work will be of great interest to students of urban planning, geography, transportation, landscape architecture, and environmental studies, as well as resilience practitioners around the world. © 2021 Billy Fields and John L.

The CO2–C and N2O–N emissions were quantified from three zones intertwined within a single U.S. northern Great Plains field: a highly productive zone (electrical conductivity with 1:1 soil/water mass ratio [EC1:1] = 0.4 dS m–1; sodium adsorption ratio [SAR] = 1.8), a transition zone (moderately salt-affected; EC1:1= 1.6 dS m–1; SAR = 4.99), and a saline/sodic zone (EC1:1 = 3.9 dS m–1; SAR = 22). In each zone, emissions were measured every 4 h for 7 d in four randomly placed chambers that were treated with two N rates (0 and 224 kg N ha–1). The experiment was conducted in 2018 and 2019 during similar seasonal periods. Soil samples taken from treatments after GHG measurement were analyzed for soil inorganic N, and microbial biomass from different communities was quantified using phospholipid fatty acid analysis. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the number of copies of some specific denitrification functional genes. The productive zone had the highest CO2–C, the lowest N2O–N emissions, and the greatest microbial biomass, whereas the saline/sodic zone had the lowest CO2–C, the highest N2O–N emissions, and the lowest microbial biomass. Within a zone, urea application did not influence CO2–C emissions; however, N2O–N emissions from the urea-treated saline/sodic zone were 84 and 57% higher than from the urea-treated productive zone in 2018 and 2019, respectively. The copy number of the nitrite reductase gene, nirS, was 42-fold higher in the saline/sodic zone than in the productive soil, suggesting that the saline/sodic soil had a high potential for denitrification. These findings suggest N2O–N emissions could be reduced by not applying N to saline/sodic zones. © 2021 The Authors.

This paper aims to assess how technologies (i.e., energy conservation measures - ECMs), used to decrease energy use, may also reduce heat emissions from buildings. This study employs the physics-based engine EnergyPlus to simulate the main components of heat emissions from buildings to ambient air: envelope, zone, and systems. Hourly simulations are run for IECC single- and multi-family reference models with three representative climates: Miami, Baltimore, and Chicago. The results show that the performance of ECMs varies among weather, seasons, and residential typologies. Particularly, some ECMs (i.e., cool coatings, heat pumps, additional insulation, energy-awareness occupants) show a strong decrease in heat emissions, yet they are not always correlated with proportional decreases in energy use. When all ECMs are combined, the reductions are larger on heat emissions (89%) than on site energy (65%) from the base cases. During summer in Miami, the combination of ECMs shows a decrease in heat emissions from the building surface component of 80% during daytime, 92% for the HVAC component and a counterbalanced increase in the zone component of 88%, bringing to a daily decrease in total heat emissions. The main contributions of this study are quantifying how typical ECMs influence residential building heat emissions using EnergyPlus simulations and informing urban planners and stakeholders on prioritizing measures for mitigating urban overheating problems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic heat; Building performance simulation; Heat emissions; Urban overheating","Energy utilization; Historic preservation; Housing; Ambient air; Anthropogenic heat; Building performance simulations; Energy conservation measures; Energy use; EnergyPlus; Heat emission; Hourly simulation; Physics-based; Urban overheating; Climate models; assessment method; building; computer simulation; heat transfer; numerical model; performance assessment; temperature anomaly; Baltimore; Chicago; Florida [United States]; Illinois; Maryland; Miami; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102065512

Here, we sequenced the soil metagenomes associated with two rice recombinant inbred lines (RILs) along with their parents, Francis and Rondo, displaying a range of low to high methane emitting phenotypes. Methane emissions and rhizosphere soil microbial communities were sampled at booting, heading, grain fill, and maturity growth stages to evaluate how plant development impacted rhizosphere communities. Methane emissions were low at booting and increased during heading and grain fill stages where peak methane emissions were observed and returned to basal levels at maturity. In response to genotype and plant developmental stage, we observed changes in rhizosphere microbial community structure in several methanogenic archaea as well as bacterial methane oxidizers and sulfur cyclers. Rice genotype played a larger role in influencing the soil microbial community structure during the reproductive phases of booting and heading as compared to the ripening phases (grain fill and maturity). Francis showed lower methane emissions and relative abundance of methanogen populations during the heading stage where methane emissions were highest for the other genotypes. This indicated that the reduced methane emissions trait was associated with small changes in the composition of methanogens rather than wholesale community shifts. This finding suggests future breeding efforts can focus on reducing methane emissions during high methane emitting phases (i.e., reproductive phases) by selecting genotypes that have lower methanogen populations and higher methanotroph populations during these developmental stages. © 2021","Methane; Methanogens; Methanotrophs; Rhizosphere; Rice","Grain (agricultural product); Methane; Methanogens; Plants (botany); Anthropogenic emissions; Developmental stage; Management practises; Methane emissions; Methanotrophs; Rhizospheres soil; Rice; Rice genotypes; Rice production; Soil microbial community; Soils; crop production; developmental stage; genotype; methane; microbial community; rhizosphere; rice; soil microorganism; Archaea; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103374092

The consumer market for electrical vehicles is growing very rapidly. Designing a network with adequate capacity and types of public charging stations is a challenge that needs to be addressed to support the current trend in the EV market. In this research, we propose a choice modeling approach embedded in a two-stage stochastic programming model to determine the optimal layout and types of EV supply equipment for a community while considering randomness in demand and drivers' behaviors. Some of the key random data parameters considered in this study are: EV's dwell time at parking location, battery's state of charge, distance from home, willingness to walk, drivers' arrival patterns, and traffic on weekdays and weekends. The two-stage model uses the sample average approximation method, which asymptotically converges to an optimal solution. To address the computational challenges for large-scale instances, we propose an outer approximation decomposition algorithm. We conduct extensive computational experiments to quantify the efficacy of the proposed approach. In addition, we present the results and a sensitivity analysis for a case study based on publicly available data sources. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","charging network; choice model; electric vehicle; L-shaped decomposition; sample average approximation; Two-stage stochastic programming","Air cleaners; Air quality; Approximation algorithms; Behavioral research; Commerce; Electric vehicles; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Noise pollution; Sensitivity analysis; Stochastic models; Stochastic programming; Stochastic systems; Choice modeling approaches; Computational challenges; Computational experiment; Decomposition algorithm; Electric vehicle charging; Electric Vehicles (EVs); Sample average approximation; Two-stage stochastic programming; Charging (batteries)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105167482

Understanding the regulatory mechanism of plant communities represents the theoretical basis for using green spaces to improve the urban climate and mitigate air particle pollution. Based on field investigations, differences in the daily air temperatures (AT), relative humidity (RH), and PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations in eight compositional types of plant communities were quantitatively analyzed. In addition, the correlations between these variables and various canopy parameters were further established in order to detect critical thresholds. The results showed that, among the eight compositional types, significant differences existed in daily AT, RH, PM10 and PM2.5 levels. The mixed tree, shrub and grass (M-TSG) community had the strongest cooling and PM10 reduction effects; the broad-leafed tree, shrub and grass (B-TSG) community had the best humidifying effect; while the mixed tree and grass (M-TG) community most effectively reduced PM2.5 concentrations. The daily AT and PM10 concentrations were significantly negatively correlated with canopy density (CD) and leaf area index (LAI), but positively correlated with canopy porosity (CP) and sky view factor (SVF), while these correlations were opposite for daily RH. The response of daily PM2.5 concentrations to canopy characteristics was complex, featuring multiple nonlinear relations. Critical thresholds were found in some cases. Overall, M-TSG or M-TG communities with about 75% CD, 55% CP, 2.5 LAI and 0.18 SVF perform most noticeable both microclimate and air particle regulation services. © 2021 by the authors.

TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) data were used to study the spatial variations of tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (TVCDs) over the study area during 16-20 weeks after the Chinese Spring Festival (25 January 2020). These data were used to select 11 regions for more detailed analysis of the variation of NO2 TVCDs on a decadal timescale. In this analysis, monthly and annual averaged NO2 TVCDs derived from OMI (Ozone Monitoring Instrument) observations were used for the years 2011 to 2019. The results show the NO2 TVCD trends for different regions, all decreasing in response to emission reduction policies but with a different onset and a possible halt of the decrease in recent years; trends and period in the south of the study area are different from those in the north. Variations of NO2 TVCDs on shorter timescales, monthly and weekly, were analyzed using TROPOMI data. In addition, the variations of weekly-averaged ground-based NO2 concentrations in 11 major cities were analyzed together with those for O3 and PM2:5. In particular these data were used to determine their effect on the air quality as expressed by the air quality index (AQI). For quantitative estimates, the use of weekly concentrations is more accurate than the use of monthly values, and the effects of long-term trends and their reversal needs to be taken into account for the separation of effects of the lockdown and the Spring Festival. Neglecting the possible reversal of the trends leads to overestimation of the lockdown effect in the south and underestimation in the north. The ground-based data confirm earlier reports, based on satellite observations, that the expected improvement of air quality due to the reduction of NO2 concentrations was offset by the increase of the concentrations of O3 and the different effects of the lockdown measures on PM2:5, as well as effects of meteorological influences and heterogeneous chemistry. The AQI seems to be mostly influenced by PM2:5 rather than NO2. A qualitative comparison between time series of satellite and ground-based NO2 observations shows both similarities and differences. The study further shows the different behaviors in city clusters in the north and south of China, as well as inland in the Sichuan and Guanzhong basins. Effects of other holidays and events are small, except in Beijing where the air quality in 2020 was notably better than in previous years. This study was undertaken for China, but the methodology and results have consequences for air quality studies in other areas, and part of the conclusions are generally applicable. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

However, these large-scale land-based approaches have raised concerns about their economic impacts, particularly their impact on food prices, as well as their environmental impacts. Here we focus on quantifying the potential scale of BECCS and its impact on the economy, taking into account technology and economic considerations, but excluding sustainability and political aspects. To do so, we represent all major components of BECCS technology in the MIT Economic Projection and Policy Analysis model. We find that BECCS could make a substantial contribution to emissions reductions in the second half of the century under 1.5 and 2 °C climate stabilization goals, with its deployment driven by revenues from carbon dioxide permits. Results show that global economic costs and the carbon prices needed to hit the stabilization targets are substantially lower with the technology available, and BECCS acts as a true backstop technology at carbon prices around $240 per tonne of carbon dioxide. If driven by economics alone, BECCS deployment increases the use of productive land for bioenergy production, causing substantial land use changes. However, the projected impact on commodity prices is quite limited at the global scale, with global commodity price indices increasing by less than 5% on average. The effect is larger at the regional scale (up to 15% in selected regions), though significantly lower than previous estimates. While BECCS deployment is likely to be constrained for environmental and/or political reasons, this study shows that the large-scale deployment of BECCS is not detrimental to agricultural commodity prices and could reduce the costs of meeting stabilization targets. Still, it is crucial that policies consider carbon dioxide removal as a complement to drastic carbon dioxide emissions reductions, while establishing a credible accounting system and sustainable limits on BECCS. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd",,"afforestation; bioenergy; carbon emission; carbon sequestration; commodity price; cost analysis; emission control; environmental economics; land use change; temperature effect; Trachinotus falcatus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103619798

The investigations are made on the basis of a set of high-resolution Euro-CORDEX models (horizontal resolution 0.11◦, about 12 km) to infer quantitative assessments about the danger of climate changes under three different Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs): business as usual scenario, i.e., without a reduction in green-house gas emissions (RCP 8.5), medium stabilization scenario (RCP 4.5) and mitigation scenario (RCP 2.6). After filtering the models with limited performances in reconstructing the current climate, the multi-model climate change scenarios were characterized by comparing the ensemble mean values computed for the base-line period (1971–2000) with those elaborated for the short-(2021–2050), medium-(2041–2070) and long-term (2071–2100). Two WMO ETCCDI indices were considered to investigate climate extremes: Consecutive Dry Days and extreme precipitations. Despite some uncertainties (related to discrepancies among the models), drought conditions and extreme precipitations will likely exacerbate in the coming decades without mitigation (RCP 8.5). Such conditions will be less critical if partial mitigation actions will be undertaken (RCP 4.5) and are expected to be significantly reduced with decarbonization policies (RCP 2.6). © 2021 by the author.

This study is aimed at identifying the putative plant growth–promoting (PGP) and endophytic gene clusters in root-associated endophytic microbes from maize root and to also verify if their abundance is affected by different farming practices. To achieve this, we characterize endophytic microbiome genes involved in PGP and endophytic lifestyle inside maize root using the shotgun metagenomic approach. Our results revealed the presence of genes involved in PGP activities such as nitrogen fixation, HCN biosynthesis, siderophore, 4-hydroxybenzoate, ACC deaminase, phenazine, phosphate solubilization, butanediol, methanol utilization, acetoin, nitrogen metabolism, and IAA biosynthesis. We also identify genes involved in stress resistance such as glutathione, catalase, and peroxidase. Our results further revealed the presence of putative genes involved in endophytic behaviors such as aerotaxis, regulator proteins, motility mechanisms, flagellum biosynthesis, nitrogen regulation, regulation of carbon storage, formation of biofilm, reduction of nitric oxide, regulation of beta-lactamase resistance, type III secretion, type IV conjugal DNA, type I pilus assembly, phosphotransferase system (PTS), and ATP-binding cassette (ABC). Our study suggests a high possibility in the utilization of endophytic microbial community for plant growth promotion, biocontrol activities, and stress mitigation.

To encourage investment in sustainable construction, this study made a case for green building materials (GBM) products and services market in the construction industry of developingcountries, through an assessment of the benefits of GBM incorporation in construction projects. Thestudy adopted an internet-mediated questionnaire survey approach and snowball sampling techniques to gathered data from clients, consultants, professionals, and contractors/sub-contractor in the southeast geopolitical zones of Nigeria. Frequency, Percentile, Shapiro-Wilk test, Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO) and Bartlett's tests, relative importance index (RII) and Kruskal-Wallis test were used to analyse the collected data. The study revealed that the green construction market is unsaturated and under-tapped. With high awareness and low adoption levels of GBM, it was concluded that the most important benefits of GBM that will trigger demand and supply of GBM products and services are improved daylight and reduced need for artificial lighting, improves the quality of life, Increase employees productivity and reduced absenteeism, improve occupants health and comfort, higher profit and return on investment, leads to construction professionals specialisation, reducing greenhouse gas emission from building, reduces toxicity in the internal environment, low operating and maintenance cost, and creates new job opportunities. The uniqueness of this study lies in the assessment of the views of construction stakeholders' in the five states that make up the South-eastern geo-politicalzone of Nigeria, regarding the key benefits that could trigger the uptake and incorporation of GBM in construction. Developers and Investors in the industry could invest in green construction since there is a ready and unsaturated market for it. © 2021 Chidiebere Emmanuel Eze et al., published by Sciendo.","Construction industry; green building; green building materials; Nigeria; sustainable construction","Building materials; Commerce; Construction industry; Employment; Green manufacturing; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Profitability; Service industry; Surveys; Sustainable development; Construction professionals; Construction projects; Construction stakeholders; Green building materials; Growth and development; Products and services; Questionnaire surveys; Sustainable construction; Construction",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104294993

Many traditional populations that inhabit the region depend on non-timber forest resources for food or economic sustenance. We demonstrated that climate change predicted for 2050 may affect the geographic distribution of 18 species of palms and trees that are extracted and used as resources by traditional populations living in extractive reserves (RESEX). According to our ecological niche models, 11 species may have a reduction in their areas of environmental suitability (AES), and nine of them may disappear from some RESEXs. In addition, 21 RESEXs may lose one or more species, while four may lose all their extractive species. We warn that the lack of socio-environmental diagnoses of these reserves makes it difficult to forecast social impacts and to develop mitigation measures. Finally, we identify priority places for the implementation of conservation policies for extractive species. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Environmental suitability; Food security; Global warming; IPCC; Protected areas; Traditional populations","climate change; conservation planning; evergreen tree; future prospect; geographical distribution; nature reserve; nontimber forest product; policy implementation; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103763031

By applying the well-known local model network approach to describe the nonlinear process in terms of linear operating point approximations, a fast and efficient model generation through data-driven system identification can be achieved. In this paper it is demonstrated how a nonlinear multivariate model predictive controller can be synthesised from the identified model directly by exploiting its representation in flatness coordinates. For the proposed controller, a compactly formulated quadratic programme results. Because of the uniform representation of all local models in controllability canonical form, a state observer is rendered unnecessary. Additionally, input and output constraints can be taken into account in the optimisation directly. The effectiveness of the control scheme is demonstrated successfully in jointly controlling the exhaust manifold pressure and the engine out NOx concentration for a heavy-duty engine on the testbed. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Differential flatness; Model predictive control; Multivariate engine control; Nonlinear control","Exhaust manifolds; Model predictive control; Nonlinear network synthesis; Quadratic programming; Automated synthesis; Heavy duty engines; Input and output constraints; Local model networks; Multivariate modeling; Non-linear model; Nonlinear process; Operating points; Controllers",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101165694

In times of recession, performance of after sales remains steady as it is highly independent of macroeconomic behaviors and keeps outstanding margins. Current automotive after sales are predominantly based on fossil fuel power train technologies, involving a significant number of replaceable working parts, lubricants, and supplies, and requiring ongoing manual labor. Current efforts to decarbonize the automotive industry, however, have the potential to disrupt this industry by shifting traditional after sales business models. The objective of this paper is to review the background and development of policies and actions in relation to the decarbonization of transport with a particular focus upon the role of the automotive after sales sector. The review considers the role of a range of stakeholders including multilateral bodies setting targets for participating nations; national governments; and the automotive industry, operating at varying scales. Electrification of vehicles and discouragement of car use and ownership are identified as key decarbonization strategies that could significantly impact upon car manufacturers and the broader automotive industry, which will in turn impact upon the after sales market. The review concludes that there has been limited research about impacts on after sales markets from transport decarbonization strategies. Areas of impact identified include reduction of working parts, fewer additional units, longer service intervals, changes in labor needs, disruption in customer retention, and changes to the repurchase cycle. In order to explore these potential impacts, the development of alternative future scenarios under different power train technologies and regional factors is recommended as an area for further research. © IMechE 2020.","Automotive after sales; customer service; decarbonization; electrification of vehicles; spare parts","Automobile manufacture; Commerce; Decarbonization; Fossil fuels; Metal drawing; Service industry; Business models; Car manufacturers; Customer retention; Customer services; National governments; Potential impacts; Regional factors; Service intervals; Sales",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097083982

It highlights how some interventions inadvertently reinforce, redistribute or create new sources of vulnerability. Four mechanisms drive these maladaptive outcomes: (i) shallow understanding of the vulnerability context; (ii) inequitable stakeholder participation in both design and implementation; (iii) a retrofitting of adaptation into existing development agendas; and (iv) a lack of critical engagement with how ‘adaptation success’ is defined. Emerging literature shows potential avenues for overcoming the current failure of adaptation interventions to reduce vulnerability: first, shifting the terms of engagement between adaptation practitioners and the local populations participating in adaptation interventions; and second, expanding the understanding of ‘local’ vulnerability to encompass global contexts and drivers of vulnerability. An important lesson from past adaptation interventions is that within current adaptation cum development paradigms, inequitable terms of engagement with ‘vulnerable’ populations are reproduced and the multi-scalar processes driving vulnerability remain largely ignored. In particular, instead of designing projects to change the practices of marginalised populations, learning processes within organisations and with marginalised populations must be placed at the centre of adaptation objectives. We pose the question of whether scholarship and practice need to take a post-adaptation turn akin to post-development, by seeking a pluralism of ideas about adaptation while critically interrogating how these ideas form part of the politics of adaptation and potentially the processes (re)producing vulnerability. We caution that unless the politics of framing and of scale are explicitly tackled, transformational interventions risk having even more adverse effects on marginalised populations than current adaptation. © 2021 The Authors","Climate change adaptation; Climate resilient development; Development interventions; Maladaptation; Post-adaptation; Vulnerability","adaptive management; climate change; climate effect; developing world; marginalization; participatory approach; policy development; stakeholder; vulnerability",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099621811

Recognizing the significance of taking measures to mitigate the UHI effect, a vast body of research has been published, over the past few decades, on this topic. Existing research covers various climatic contexts and has significantly improved our understanding of the dynamics of the UHI. However, there is a lack of research on the potential linkages between the physical form of urban streets and the UHI effect. The results of such research can be used to develop planning and design strategies for achieving climate-resilient urban development. As a step toward filling this gap, in this study, we use a mixed-methods approach, involving graph theory and spatial statistics to examine the relationship between the UHI effect and selected urban form measures such as street network connectivity, street network centrality, and land-use in Izmir, Turkey. Results show that the UHI effect is more intense in areas with higher levels of street network centrality. On the contrary, higher connectivity of the urban street network is associated with lower levels of the UHI effect. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Adaptation; Centrality; Connectivity; Graph theory; Urban climate change mitigation; Urban form; Urban heat island; Urban street network","connectivity; heat island; strategic approach; urban area; urban development; urban planning; urban region; Izmir [Turkey]; Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85090300227

Open top chamber (OTC) experiments as well as the experimental set-ups with active warming focus on many facets of plant growth and performance, but information on morphological alterations of plant cells is still scarce. Here we compare the effects of in-situ warming on leaf epidermal cell expansion in dwarf birch, Betula nana in Finland, Greenland, and Poland. The localities of the three insitu warming experiments represent contrasting regions of B. nana distribution, with the sites in Finland and Greenland representing the current main distribution in low and high Arctic, respectively, and the continental site in Poland as a B. nana relict Holocene microrefugium. We quantified the epidermal cell lateral expansion by microscopic analysis of B. nana leaf cuticles. The leaves were produced in paired experimental treatment plots with either artificial warming or ambient temperature. At all localities, the leaves were collected in two years at the end of the growing season to facilitate between-site and within-site comparison. The measured parameters included the epidermal cell area and circumference, and using these, the degree of cell wall undulation was calculated as an Undulation Index (UI). We found enhanced leaf epidermal cell expansion under experimental warming, except for the extremely low temperature Greenland site where no significant difference occurred between the treatments. These results demonstrate a strong response of leaf growth at individual cell level to growing season temperature, but also suggest that in harsh conditions other environmental factors may limit this response. Our results provide evidence of the relevance of climate warming for plant leaf maturation and underpin the importance of studies covering large geographical scales. © 2021 Ercan et al.

Microclimates are a particularly important consideration in topographically heterogeneous landscapes, while in some habitats, such as forests and woodlands, microclimates are also extremely labile and affected by management practices that could consequently be used to offset climate change impact. This study explored a conservation priority guild—cyanolichen epiphytes in temperate rainforest—quantifying the niche response to macroclimate, and landscape or woodland stand structures that determine the microclimate. Based on epiphyte survey in a core region of European temperate rainforest (western Scotland), a ‘random forest’ machine-learning model confirmed a strong cyanolichen response to summer dryness, as well as the effects of distance to running water, topographic heatload and tree species identity, which modify the local moisture regime and/or lichen growth rates. By quantifying this response to macroclimate, landscape and stand structures, it was possible to estimate an extent to which woodland may be expanded in the future, to offset a negative effect of increasing summer dryness projected through to the 2080s. Using current policy as a yardstick, sufficient woodland expansion could be delivered relatively quickly for median impacted sites, but with times to woodland delivery extending over 10, 20 and 25 years for sites at the 75th, 90th and 95th percentiles of cyanolichen decline. Furthermore, the extent of new woodland required, and delivery times, increase almost threefold on average, as new woodland becomes distributed over wider riparian zones. These contrasting implications emphasize an urgent need for afforestation that achieves targeted spatial planning responsive to microclimates as refugia. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","climate change adaptation; epiphytes; microclimate; moisture index; reforestation; riparian woodland; summer drought","afforestation; climate change; drought; forest ecosystem; lichen; microclimate; rainforest; reforestation; refugium; riparian zone; spatial planning; summer; temperate forest; woodland; Trixis; climate change; microclimate; rain forest; Scotland; tree; Climate Change; Microclimate; Rainforest; Scotland; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101027097

However, some concerns remain about the global suitability of the scheme for LST and SUHI studies in different macroclimate regions. By analyzing and comparing a large number of representative LCZ sites and multi-year remotely-sensed LST data, the aim of this work is twofold. Firstly, to study the suitability of the LCZ scheme, with a focus on the built types, for surface temperature studies in four distinct macroclimate regions, namely, the tropical, the arid, the temperate and the cold. Secondly, to understand the influence of the macroclimate region on the LST and SUHI characteristics of the standard LCZ built types. Results show that the urban LCZ standard scheme is applicable, with varying degrees, to all macroclimate regions other than the arid, where a LCZ subclassification might be essential. Also, it has been demonstrated that most LCZ built types exhibit significantly different LST and SUHI characteristics across the remaining macroclimate regions. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Land surface temperature; Local climate zones; Surface urban heat island; Urban morphology; World macroclimate regions; WUDAPT",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103311007

It offers significant environmental and societal benefits through the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions or the reduction of long-term waste management costs. LFM's profitability, however, is still in question and public investment support might be necessary to fully exploit its potential. To enable decision-makers to identify the best solutions for a landfill site, societal impacts of LFM still have to be investigated. Throughout relevant literature, societal impacts of LFM projects have only selectively been studied and it remains unclear if and which benefits justify policy interventions. This paper firstly provides a comprehensive conceptualization of the societal impact of an LFM project and dives into the underlying societal context of this emerging industry. It disentangles formerly identified burdens and benefits by applying a system dynamics approach to LFM research. Based on this approach, four causal loop diagrams are presented showing how LFM is embedded into its societal context, analyzing the composition of the net societal impact of an LFM project, the mechanisms influencing LFM's public acceptance, and the dynamics of the market acceptance of LFM products. Key variables and leverage points have been identified, such as (i) technology choices influencing avoided impacts from the mitigations of primary resource consumption, since many societal impacts are closely related to environmental impacts, (ii) a timely and broad stakeholder involvement to prevent project opposition, and (iii) the after-use of the mined landfill, generating a major part of the local and regional societal benefits but also creating potential conflicts between stakeholder interests. Key intradimensional trade-offs and potential conflicts were identified in (i) spatial and (ii) temporal risk distribution, (iii) conflicting societal goals of the after-use such as job creations and recreation, as well as (iv) material and energy recuperation. These findings provide important insights for LFM decision-makers and can help to implement this emerging industry in a sustainable way. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Causal loop diagram; Circular economy; Landfill mining; Societal impact; Sustainability; System dynamics","Commerce; Decision making; Economic and social effects; Environmental impact; Environmental technology; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Investments; Land fill; System theory; Causal loop diagrams; Circular economy; Decision makers; Landfill mining; Mining projects; Potential conflict; Societal benefits; Societal impacts; System Dynamics; System dynamics approach; Sustainable development",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101980222

Recent work suggests this emissions source is larger than previously believed and that repairing a small number of high emitters can cost-effectively reduce system-wide leakage. How successful are these repairs on the ground? Here, we assess the effectiveness of repair policies in the Massachusetts distribution system. Our analysis leverages state-wide utility data, on-site empirical measurements, stakeholder interviews, and document and legal analysis. We use these mixed methods to investigate the rate of repair failure, where a gas utility identifies and fixes a leak, but on-site emissions are not eliminated. We find that repair failures are relatively common, yet they are repeatedly neglected in policy. By not accounting for repair failures, policy may overestimate the effectiveness of distribution system repairs in meeting local greenhouse gas reduction targets. These results also underscore the importance of data transparency for monitoring and verifying subnational climate policies. © 2021 The Authors.

The results are presented at unsteady and final steady conditions, and the impact of time-dependent regimes and variations in equivalence ratio, from lean flame to rich one, are analyzed. The governing equations including continuity, momentum, energy, and species are numerically solved with a coupled simple and Piso algorithm. It is also found that when the strain rate value is 1000 s−1, for flame stability, the hydraulic distance of the microchannel must be at least 0.05 mm. Increasing the strain rate results in decreasing the time of stabilizing temperature distribution with a faster quasi-steady equilibrium. The necessity of time-dependent analysis is to comprehend the variations in the main factors of flame structure before reaching the finalized steady-state condition. Therefore, by designing an intermittent automatic valve, if the flow stops in time period of 0.0025 s and starts again, the formation of NO2 and CO2 will be reduced about 50% and 9%, respectively, in a case with a = 100 s−1 © 2020 by ASME","Air emissions from fossil fuel combustion; Counterflow flame; Fuel combustion; Numerical modeling; Premixed methane-air mixture; Quasi-steady equilibrium; Unsteady solution","Methane; Counterflow flames; Equivalence ratios; Governing equations; Stability parameters; Steady conditions; Steady-state condition; Time-dependent analysis; Unsteady analysis; Strain rate",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106949830

While many N fertilization experiments found increased forest C storage, the mechanisms driving this response at the ecosystem scale remain uncertain. Following the optimal allocation theory, augmented N availability may reduce belowground C investment by trees to roots and soil symbionts. To test this prediction and its implications on soil biogeochemistry, we constructed C and N budgets for a long-term, whole-watershed N fertilization study at the Fernow Experimental Forest, WV, USA. Nitrogen fertilization increased C storage by shifting C partitioning away from belowground components and towards aboveground woody biomass production. Fertilization also reduced the C cost of N acquisition, allowing for greater C sequestration in vegetation. Despite equal fine litter inputs, the C and N stocks and C : N ratio of the upper mineral soil were greater in the fertilized watershed, likely due to reduced decomposition of plant litter. By combining aboveground and belowground data at the watershed scale, this study demonstrates how plant C allocation responses to N additions may result in greater C storage in both vegetation and soil. © 2021 The Authors New Phytologist © 2021 New Phytologist Foundation","carbon cycling; experimental N addition; N acquisition strategies; optimal allocation theory; plant biomass allocation; temperate forest; terrestrial carbon sink","aboveground biomass; biomass allocation; carbon; carbon storage; forest ecosystem; litter; nitrogen; watershed; Fernow Experimental Forest; United States; West Virginia; Matthiola; carbon; nitrogen; biomass; ecosystem; forest; soil; tree; Biomass; Carbon; Ecosystem; Forests; Nitrogen; Soil; Trees",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102208809

FEformate = 100% at −0.6 V vs RHE). These promising electrocatalytic characteristics result from the coupling of two distinct reaction pathways of formate formation in the aqueous CO2-sat. 0.5 M KHCO3 electrolyte, which are active on (i) the partly reduced Bi2O3 foam at low overpotentials (sub-carbonate pathway) and (ii) on the corresponding metallic Bimet foam catalyst at medium and high overpotentials (Bi−O pathway). For the first time, operando Raman spectroscopy provides experimental evidence for the embedment of CO2 into the oxidic Bi2O3 matrix (sub-carbonate formation) at low overpotentials prior to and during the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). The gradual transition of the formed carbonate/oxide composite catalyst into its fully metallic state is monitored by operando Raman spectroscopy as a function of electrolysis time and applied potential. The observed structural and compositional alterations correlate with changes in the faradaic efficiency and partial current density of formate production (PCDformate), which reaches a maximum value of PCDformate = −84.1 mA cm−2 at −1.5 V vs RHE.

However, several countries have turned to solar energy in their goal to “green” their energy generation. Solar energy has the potential to displace coal with support from natural gas. In this study, an hourly power flow analysis was conducted to understand the potential, limitations, and implications of using solar energy as a driver for decommissioning coal power plants. To ensure the results’ robustness, the study presents a straightforward weather-driven scenario analysis that utilizes historical weather and electricity demand to generate representative scenarios. This approach was tested in Japan’s southernmost region, since it represents a regional grid with high PV penetration and a fleet of coal plants older than 40 years. The results revealed that solar power could decommission 3.5 GW of the 7 GW coal capacity in Kyushu. It was discovered that beyond 12 GW, solar power could not reduce the minimum coal capacity, but it could still reduce coal generation. By increasing the solar capacity from 10 GW to 20 GW and the LNG quota from 10 TWh to 28 TWh, solar and LNG electricty generation could reduce the emissions by 37%, but the cost will increase by 5.6%. Results also show various ways to reduce emissions, making the balance between cost and CO2 a policy decision. The results emphasized that investing in solar power alone will not be enough, and another source of energy is necessary, especially for summer and winter. The weather-driven approach highlighted the importance of weather in the analysis, as it affected the results to varying degrees. The approach, with minor changes, could easily be replicated in other nations or regions provided that historical hourly temperature, irradiance, and demand data are available. © 2021 by the authors.

The dose-specific effects of NP on sludge anaerobic digestion by shaping acidification and methanogenesis were reported. Both low (50 mg/kg) and high (1000 mg/kg) NP doses were beneficial to acidification and aceticlastic methanogenesis (AM), and high NP dose further stimulated hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis (HM). Stable isotope probing analysis indicated that the predominant methanogenic pathway was shifted from AM to a combination of AM and HM as NP dose increased. Acidogenic and methanogenic consortia were accumulated and restructured by NP in favor of acidification and substrate-based methanogenesis. Acidification-related genes for bioconversion of substrates into acetate (glycolysis, stickland reaction and pyruvate metabolism), acetate transportation and microbial robust performance were enriched with both low and high NP doses. Methanogenesis-related genes encoding acetyl-CoA dehydrogenase/synthetase (CODH/ACS) in aceticlastic pathway and transporters for coenzyme synthesis were enhanced by both NP doses. Besides, high NP dose promoted a majority of genes in CO2-reduction pathway and key material transporters for coenzyme F420 and heterodisulfide reductase synthesis.

Therefore, a full understanding of the possible impacts of climate change on Pearl River Basin is desired. In this study, the potential changes in temperature, precipitation, and drought conditions were projected through a stepwise clustering projection (SCP) model driven by multiple GCMs under two different RCPs. The developed model could facilitate specifying the inherently complex relationship between predictors and predictands, and its performance was proven to be great by comparing the observations and model simulations. A multi-level factorial analysis was employed to explore the major contributing factors to the variations in projecting drought conditions. The results suggested that the Pearl River Basin would suffer significant increasing trends in Tmean (i.e., 0.25–0.34 °C per decade under RCP4.5 and 0.42–0.60 °C per decade under RCP8.5), and the annual mean precipitation would increase under both RCPs. The drought events lasting for 1–2 months would be decreased by 7.7%, lasting for 3–4 months would be increased by 4.3%, and lasting for more than five months would be increased by 3.4% under RCP4.5, respectively. While they changed to 6.1%, 1.4%, and 4.7% under RCP8.5, respectively. More medium and long-term drought events with higher drought severity would occur. GCM has dominant influences on four different responses of drought duration, accounting for 50.20%, 52.61%, 56.71%, and 56.24% of total variabilities, respectively.

This paper provides a state-of-the-art review of Phase Change Materials (PCM) applied in M-TES systems. The concept of the M-TES system is briefly described and summarized, including available IWH sources, heating and cooling facilities (for distributed end users), and the main features of two different types of M-TES containers. Recent research achievements in the field have been reviewed, focusing on developed prototypes, experimental and numerical studies, and economic and environmental evaluations. Finally, the barriers to the application of M-TES and possible solutions are discussed. The review highlighted that direct-contact M-TES storage systems can have up to 60% shorter charging and discharging periods when compared to indirect-contact M-TES storage systems with similar storage capacities. Using heat transfer enhancement techniques such as graphite additives, the charging and discharging period for indirect-contact M-TES container can be shortened by up to 74% and 67%, respectively, and that the charging time of direct-contact M-TES can be reduced by up to 29%. The use of M-TES to provide heat can significantly decrease the primary energy requirement, exergy losses and the CO2 emissions by up to 95%, 60% and 93%, respectively, compared to conventional heating facilities using fossil fuels.

It also presents directions for knowledge diffusion on decarbonization to develop a sustainable energy strategy for Poland, particularly for local governments and cities. Despite extensive research on the determinants of decarbonization and sustainable energy development, there is a lack of specific solutions in this area. The authors of this paper investigated which determinants, according to the respondents, would lead to better decarbonization solutions in cities and villages in terms of sustainability. The studied sample was purposefully selected and an online questionnaire was used with the use of the “snowball” method. The authors conducted surveys that allowed the concerned parties themselves (respondents) to indicate which factors they believe best influence decarbonization. Such measures are helpful in terms of the understanding public acceptance of decarbonization in terms of the energy transition. This is of particular importance in terms of green governance globally and in Europe. The results of the authors’ research indicate that despite the reduction in the share of coal in residential and domestic heating, coal remains the main source of electricity generation and that the potential for low-carbon policy to have an impact on solving urban challenges is underestimated. From the findings, it can be concluded that more in-depth research is needed on public acceptance of decarbonization in its broadest sense and its implications. © 2021 by the authors.

Emission regulations have historically targeted volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to reduce ozone, but intermediate volatility organic compounds (IVOCs) also contribute to ozone formation and the formation of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) that often dominates fine particulate matter. Emission rates and pollutant formation from IVOCs are not well constrained in current inventories and models. This study uses diesel fuel as a representative IVOC mixture in evaporation tests performed in a wind tunnel under varying wind speeds and liquid diesel temperatures. Comprehensive composition measurements guided the development of a model to determine rates of evaporation and estimate pollutant production. Results show that reducing IVOC emissions can result in significant reductions in ozone formation, in addition to the expected reductions in SOA formation, and that IVOC emissions can continue over the course of a month. Ozone formation from IVOC emissions is equal to that from VOCs after 3 days of evaporation at 0.65 g-ozone/g-diesel released.

We handle the acoustic part of the problem by modeling the cluster as a sensor network, and we propose a centralized control strategy for the agents that exploits the spatial sensitivity pattern of the sensor network to estimate the best possible cluster configuration with respect to the expected target position. In order to take into account the position estimation delay due to the frame-based nature of the processing, the possible positions of the acoustic target in a given future time interval are represented in terms of a compatible set, that is, the set of all possible future positions of the target, given its dynamics and its present state. A frame-by-frame cluster reconfiguration algorithm is presented, which adapts the position of each sensing agent with the goal of pursuing the maximum overlap between the region of high acoustic sensitivity of the entire cluster and the compatible set of the sound-emitting target. The tracking scheme iterates, at each observation frame, the computation of the target compatible set, the reconfiguration of the cluster, and the target acoustic localization. The reconfiguration step makes use of an opportune cost function proportional to the difference of the compatibility set and the acoustic sensitivity spatial pattern determined by the mobile agent positions. Simulations under different geometric configurations and positioning constraints demonstrate the ability of the proposed approach to effectively localize and track a moving target based on its acoustic emission. The Doppler effect related to moving sources and sensors is taken into account, and its impact on performance is analyzed.

Taking advantage of spectral and spatial enhancement in Landsat OLI images, a machine learning based kNN algorithm was applied to derive AGB maps of a pristine forest of Pinus kesiya in 2014 and 2019 via allometric models of the pine and inventory data. AGB productivity of the study site was derived and examined for diagnosing the pristine pine forest development. The radiance of the Landsat image was first restored and then normalized by the FLAASH model, a radiation transfer model-based algorithm used to derive surface reflectance image, and finally a pansharpening technique was applied to improve the spatial resolution while retaining the spectral resolution of the reflectance image. Results showed that the pansharpened surface reflectance image was able to derive AGB maps with a satisfactory accuracy of root mean square percentage error, RMSPE = 15%, which shows significant improvement on the performance of AGB estimation using the raw image (RMSPE = 56%) and non-pansharpened surface reflectance image (RMSPE = 48%). The loss of AGB stocks is mainly caused by landslide, forest fire, and agricultural expansion, particularly the use of fire for land preparation for cropping. Land covers other than pine stands have complicated the edge of the pristine pine forest. The non-forest cover types surrounded the forest enlarged the boundary of the forest and made the pristine forest slightly fragmented. The results also showed that the AGB loss/gain of a forest parcel is negatively/positively related to the size of the parcel. Appropriate forest land zoning and community-based forest management for the surrounding non-pristine pine forest could have the benefit of mitigating the degradation of the pristine pine forest and improving the biomass stocks for better REDD achievements. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","AGB productivity; Forest conservation management; Forest degradation; Image normalization; Landscape change","Agricultural robots; Biomass; Deforestation; Machine learning; Productivity; Reflection; Turing machines; Aboveground biomass; Agricultural expansion; Community-based forest managements; Radiation transfer model; Reflectance images; Spatial enhancement; Spatial resolution; Surface reflectance; Image enhancement; aboveground biomass; allometry; coniferous forest; coniferous tree; forest cover; forest ecosystem; forest management; Landsat; pristine environment; satellite imagery; spatial resolution; spatiotemporal analysis; surface reflectance; Biomass; Deforestation; Land; Pinus; Productivity; Reflectance; Reflection; Surfaces; Matthiola; Pinus kesiya",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101171925

Direct flux measurements by eddy covariance (EC) provide an independent reference for bulk flux estimates and are often used to study processes that drive K. However, inherent uncertainties in EC air sea CO2 flux measurements from ships have not been well quantified and may confound analyses of K. This paper evaluates the uncertainties in EC CO2 fluxes from four cruises. Fluxes were measured with two state-of-the-art closed-path CO2 analysers on two ships. The mean bias in the EC CO2 flux is low, but the random error is relatively large over short timescales. The uncertainty (1 standard deviation) in hourly averaged EC air sea CO2 fluxes (cruise mean) ranges from 1.4 to 3.2 mmolm2 d1. This corresponds to a relative uncertainty of 20% during two Arctic cruises that observed large CO2 flux magnitude. The relative uncertainty was greater (50 %) when the CO2 flux magnitude was small during two Atlantic cruises. Random uncertainty in the EC CO2 flux is mostly caused by sampling error. Instrument noise is relatively unimportant. Random uncertainty in EC CO2 fluxes can be reduced by averaging for longer. However, averaging for too long will result in the inclusion of more natural variability. Auto-covariance analysis of CO2 fluxes suggests that the optimal timescale for averaging EC CO2 flux measurements ranges from 1 to 3 h, which increases the mean signal-to-noise ratio of the four cruises to higher than 3. Applying an appropriate averaging timescale and suitable 1fCO2 threshold (20 uatm) to EC flux data enables an optimal analysis of K. © 2021 BMJ Publishing Group.

This article uses a multi-regional input-output (MRIO) model to explore the flow of embodied carbon emissions and embodied carbon emission intensities in the ICT sector triggered by trade in 15 major economies around the world from 2000 to 2014. The article further discusses the emission-reduction strategies of each ICT sector. The results show that: (1) The overall embodied carbon emissions of ICT have demonstrated a significant downward trend, but the proportion of embodied carbon emissions caused by trade is increasing; (2) The embodied carbon emissions in the ICT sector of most developed countries in 2014 are significantly lower than in 2000, but in developing countries such as China and India they show an upward trend during this period; (3) The ICT sector’s export embodied carbon emission intensity in Indonesia is much higher than that of other countries, and the embodied carbon emissions of ICT exported by Mexico have increased significantly; (4) The manufacture of computer, electronic and optical products (S1) is the main contributor to the ICT sector’s embodied carbon emissions, while import embodied carbon emission intensities among publishing activities (S2) are increasing significantly in most countries.

The management of farmland can influence a variety of agro-ecological processes and affect greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Based on reported data, this study conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the role of conservation tillage (CT) in managing climate change in Northwest China. The results indicated that CT significantly improved the concentration of soil organic carbon (SOC), crop yields, and crop water use efficiency (WUE) compared with traditional tillage, and the practices with straw return were significantly higher than those without straw return. With an extended duration of the management, the SOC sequestration of each CT practice showed an increasing trend, but the crop yield did not show an obvious trend. After 5 ~ 10 years and more than 10-year management, CT practices reduced GHG emissions by 5.40 ~ 16.16 t CO2-eq∙ha−1 and 8.22 ~ 21.53 t CO2-eq∙ha−1 compared to traditional tillage, respectively. In most CT practices, winter wheat-summer maize rotation (W-M) planting pattern had the best SOC sequestration, and spring wheat showed the highest increasing of yield and WUE. More specifically, compared to traditional tillage, the SOC concentration under W-M increased by 10.15 ~ 20.09%, and the yield and WUE under spring wheat increased by 6.87 ~ 17.83% and 8.82 ~ 46.32%, respectively. In conclusion, CT played a positive role in tackling climate change in Northwest China. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Climate change; Conservation tillage; Crop water use efficiency; Crop yield; Soil organic carbon concentration","arid region; carbon sequestration; climate change; conservation tillage; crop yield; semiarid region; soil organic matter; water use efficiency; China",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106905246

It is largely unknown, however, how individual foods or entire diets affect human health via poor air quality. We show how food production negatively impacts human health by increasing atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5), and we identify ways to reduce these negative impacts of agriculture. We quantify the air quality-related health damages attributable to 95 agricultural commodities and 67 final food products, which encompass &gt;99% of agricultural production in the United States. Agricultural production in the United States results in 17,900 annual air quality-related deaths, 15,900 of which are from food production. Of those, 80% are attributable to animalbased foods, both directly fromanimal production and indirectly from growing animal feed. On-farm interventions can reduce PM2.5-related mortality by 50%, including improved livestock waste management and fertilizer application practices that reduce emissions of ammonia, a secondary PM2.5precursor, and improved crop and animal production practices that reduce primary PM2.5emissions from tillage, field burning, livestock dust, and machinery. Dietary shifts toward more plant-based foods that maintain protein intake and other nutritional needs could reduce agricultural air quality-related mortality by 68 to 83%. In sum, improved livestock and fertilization practices, and dietary shifts could greatly decrease the health impacts of agriculture caused by its contribution to reduced air quality. © 2021 National Academy of Sciences.

In addition to more conscious behaviors and wiser product design (“design for recycling”), a key challenge is the identification of the leading recycling technologies, minimizing the global warming potential in an industrially relevant context. Chemical recycling technologies based on pyrolysis and gasification are leading the way because of their robustness and good economics, but an improved understanding of the chemistry and more innovative reactor designs are required to realize a potential reduction of greenhouse gas emissions of more than 100 million tonnes of CO2-eq., primarily by more efficient use of valuable natural resources. The feed flexibility of thermal processes supports the potential of pyrolysis and gasification, however, the strong variability in time and space of blending partners such as multiple and co-polymers, additives, and contaminants (such as inorganic materials) calls for accurate assessment through fundamental experiments and models. Such complex and variable mixtures are strongly sensitive to the process design and conditions: temperature, residence time, heating rates – severity, mixing level, heat and mass transfer strongly affect the thermal degradation of SPW and its selectivity to valuable products. A prerequisite in improving design and performance is the ability to model conversion profiles and product distributions based on accurate rate coefficients for the dominating reaction families established using first-principle derived transport and thermodynamic properties. These models should also help with the “design for recycling” strategy to increase recyclability, for example by identifying additives that make chemical recycling difficult. Fundamental experiments of increased quality (accuracy, integrity, validity, replicability, completeness) together with improved deterministic kinetic models, systematically developed according to the reaction classes and rate rules approach, provide insights to identify optimal process conditions. This will allow shedding some light upon the important pathways involved in the thermal degradation of the feedstock and the formation/disappearance of desired or unwanted products. In parallel, the intrinsic kinetics of the dominating elementary reaction steps should be determined with higher accuracy, moving beyond single step kinetics retrieved from thermogravimetric analysis experiments. Together with more accurate kinetic parameters, better models to account for heat and mass transfer limitations also need to be further developed, since plastic degradation involves at least three phases (solid, liquid, gas), whose interactions should be accounted for in a more rigorous way. Novel experimental approaches (e.g. detailed feedstock and product characterization using comprehensive chromatographic techniques and photoionization mass spectrometry) and available computational tools (e.g. kinetic Monte Carlo, liquid phase, and heterogeneous theoretical kinetics) are needed to tackle these problems and improve our fundamental understanding of chemical recycling of SPW. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Chemical recycling; Circular economy; Gasification; Kinetic modeling; Polymer degradation; Pyrolysis; Solid plastic waste","Additives; Blending; Chromatography; Comminution; Degradation; Economics; Feedstocks; Gas emissions; Gasification; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Heat transfer; Kinetic parameters; Marine pollution; Mass spectrometry; Mass transfer; Monte Carlo methods; Product design; Pyrolysis; Reaction kinetics; Residence time distribution; Thermogravimetric analysis; Chemical recycling technologies; Chromatographic techniques; Experimental approaches; Fundamental experiments; Global warming potential; Photoionization mass spectrometry; Product characterizations; Pyrolysis and gasification; Plastic recycling",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101232173

Its importance in the environment is related to the mitigation of methane emissions from soil and water to the atmosphere. Brazilian mangroves are highly productive, have potential to methane production, and it is inferred that methanotrophic community is of great importance for this ecosystem. The scope of this study was to investigate the functional and taxonomic diversity of methanotrophic bacteria present in the anthropogenic impacted sediments from Bertioga´s mangrove (SP, Brazil). Sediment sample was cultivated with methane and the microbiota actively involved in methane oxidation was identified by DNA-based stable isotope probing (DNA-SIP) using methane as a labeled substrate. After 4 days (96 h) of incubation and consumption of 0.7 mmol of methane, the most active microorganisms were related to methanotrophs Methylomonas and Methylobacter as well as to methylotrophic Methylotenera, indicating a possible association of these bacterial groups within a methane-derived food chain in the Bertioga mangrove. The abundance of genera Methylomonas, able to couple methane oxidation to nitrate reduction, may indicate that under low dissolved oxygen tensions, some aerobic methanotrophs could shift to intraerobic methane oxidation to avoid oxygen starvation. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC part of Springer Nature.","Oxidation of methane; pmoA; Methanotrophic bacteria; Methylotrophic bacteria; DGGE; Aerobic methanotrophs",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85098651155

It relies on household panel data merged with data on subnational disasters across the three countries and employs multiple measures to capture disaster prevalence of droughts, floods, and epidemics, recorded variably at the household and subnational levels. Multivariate regression analysis uncovers that environment shocks prolong poverty through direct biophysical impacts but also indirectly through various negative consequences and distress coping mechanisms in which vulnerable households engage. These include reduced food consumption and food insecurity and reduced asset values. While subnationally there are positive undercurrents, through relief aid and other forms of support that could help protect or replace assets, at the micro-level, the results suggest that many households may survive through migration and local remittances to complement household welfare. Ensuring a supportive financial environment for poor households in these contexts, alongside risk-informed policy and programming, would help alleviate key stressors that keep households persistently under the poverty line in contexts of climate-induced shocks and stressors. © 2021 ERP Environment and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","climate; coping strategies; food insecurity; household assets; poverty; sub-Saharan Africa","climate effect; coping strategy; disaster management; food consumption; food security; panel data; poverty; regression analysis; Niger [West Africa]; Tanzania; Uganda",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104273992

Still, a certain amount of resilience allowed to withstand its sharp decline. The Serra da Estrela cheese production, the most representative agro-pastoral system of the Portuguese Centro Region, is a demonstrative case study. The main objective of this research is to understand the trajectory of this system up to present, its adaptation to internal and external changes and evolution trends. We used the concepts of resilience and socio-ecological system as framework in a qualitative study. Participatory methods were applied using the perspectives of local actors, in order to identify and analyze the key factors. The main drivers are socio-demographic (ageing, depopulation, social perception of the profession), economic (free market, industrialization), political (lack of adequate of national and European policies) and environmental (climate change, forest fires). Our results are in line with other European cases. To cope with these trends, the system is irreversibly transforming, moving into a new trajectory characterized by different systemic architecture. In face of the ongoing changes, the interactions between the social and the ecological subsystems are blurring, whereas local communities and traditions are being excluded. © 2021 by the authors.

Entailed instalment of sophisticated energy-producing plants is constantly expanding to meet the socio-economic demands of communities and industries. Innumerable superior technologies have been introduced to minimise waste pollution while reducing emissions of greenhouse gases hence, combatting the impact of global warming. This review shows energy conversion technologies including gasification, pyrolysis, incineration, landfill, and bioelectrochemical technologies mainly microbial fuel cell (MFC), microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) and microbial electrosynthesis (MES). Traditionally, incineration and landfill are the main mean of waste conversion but not favourable because of their side effects, economic viability, secondary pollution and difficulty in mechanical compression. Recently, biological processes including anaerobic digestion have gained huge interest but possess some inherent drawbacks and cannot provide a comprehensive solution for future waste management. Among energy converting technologies, bio-electrochemical MFC system is highly preferred as an elementary, clean, safe, economically viable and environmentally beneficial technology. MFC a renewable energy technology possesses multidimensional applications of producing electric power and treat wastewater. In addition, the MFCs can be modified into MEC to generate hydrogen energy from various organic matters. Prospective modification recommendations for scale-up application of this technology are also presented. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd","biomass; energy; microbial fuel cells; technologies; waste","Air pollution; Anaerobic digestion; Economics; Energy conversion; Energy policy; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Land fill; Regenerative fuel cells; Waste incineration; Wastewater treatment; Bio-electrochemical; Converting technologies; Emerging technologies; Energy conversion technologies; Mechanical compression; Microbial electrolysis cell (MECs); Renewable energy technologies; Secondary pollution; Microbial fuel cells",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099108652

The measurement procedure is specified and involves the dilution of the exhaust gas in a so-called constant volume sampling (CVS) device. Research efforts are concentrating in the further development of existing measurement techniques in order to capture smaller particles down to 10 nm, given their higher health threatening potential. In the present study, six state of art, Euro 6, gasoline vehicles and in addition, one compressed natural gas (CNG) light duty vehicle, have been measured on the chassis dynamometer during different test cycles. Three particle sampling lines have been used, two in parallel at the CVS, counting particles >23 nm and 10 nm, and a third one directly at the tailpipe of the vehicle. The results allow a detailed evaluation of the emitted PNs. In addition, differences in the emissions patterns of the direct fuel injection (DI) and multi point port injection (MPI) gasoline vehicles could be identified. During cold starts, particles have been separated in distinctive size classes in order to obtain relevant number-size distributions. Counting particles >10 nm resulted in roughly doubling the PN emissions in respect to those when counting particles >23 nm. This relation holds for all examined driving cycles. PNs measured at the CVS where significantly higher than at the tailpipe, especially when capturing also the smaller particles. The CVS could be identified contributing to the increase of the registered particle numbers during cycle parts with no or very low engine particle emissions. Lowest PN emissions have been measured in combination with the CNG vehicle. The differences between DI and MPI gasoline vehicles have been significantly lower than expected from previous studies. While the MPI gasoline vehicles have been identified to emit more PN during cold start, the DI vehicles emit larger numbers during high engine loads. During cold starts, higher emissions of smallest particles have been evident. The increased rated power to displacement ratio of modern engines, based on the current “downsizing” trend, shows a good correlation with the PN emissions. © 2020 The Authors","CNG; Gasoline light duty vehicles; PN emission; PN larger than 10nm","Compressed natural gas; Dynamometers; Exhaust systems (engine); Gasoline; Natural gas vehicles; Chassis dynamometers; Compressed natural gasses (CNG); Constant volume sampling; Displacement ratios; Light duty vehicles; Measurement procedures; Measurement techniques; Number size distribution; Light weight vehicles",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100092289

We linked a previously published multidimensional population projection with emission projections from an integrated assessment model to quantify the localised (i.e. state-level) health benefits from reduced ambient fine particulate matter in India under global climate change mitigation scenarios in line with the Paris Agreement targets and national scenarios for maximum feasible air quality control. We incorporated assumptions about future demographic, urbanisation and epidemiological trends and accounted for model feedbacks. Our results indicate that compared to a business-as-usual scenario, pursuit of aspirational climate change mitigation targets can avert up to 8.0 million premature deaths and add up to 0.7 years to life expectancy (LE) at birth due to cleaner air by 2050. Combining aggressive climate change mitigation efforts with maximum feasible air quality control can add 1.6 years to LE. Holding demographic change constant, we find that climate change mitigation and air quality control will contribute slightly more to increases in LE in urban areas than in rural areas and in states with lower socio-economic development. © 2021 The Author(s).

Clear diurnal and seasonal variations of both greenhouse gases were detected. The observed increased levels during night and early morning hours are attributed to traffic/heating emissions and leakages of residential natural gas for CO2 and CH4, respectively. Using CO2 and CH4 levels simultaneously measured at the regional background site at Finokalia (Greece), increments in their levels due to local and regional anthropogenic sources within the city were assessed. For CO2, maximum and minimum increments were clearly observed during winter and summer respectively, suggesting a greater impact of combustion of fossil fuel and especially of biomass on CO2 levels during winter. On the other hand, CH4 increments were similar in all seasons, suggesting that local sources of CH4 remain quite constant year-round. Through the implementation of the Conditional Probability Function (CPF), the emission sources of theses greenhouse gases have been localized to the northern and the eastern domains of the Athens basin. Stagnant atmospheric conditions were also associated with an increased likelihood of CO2 and CH4 episodes. Backward modeling simulations with FLEXPART and HYSPLIT models indicate an industrial zone and a petrochemical zone, situated to the north and to the west of Athens respectively, as possible CH4 regional sources as well as possible CO2 contributions from southern directions attributed to shipping emissions from the port of Piraeus.

Transport companies have to face challenges in increased complexity when identifying an optimum system approach and choosing the most suitable technology. A modelling and evaluation approach is introduced to compare the diesel to several battery-electric bus systems and permits the assessment of the importance of each of the system components. Although the modelling is quite simple, the use of data derived from several years of bus operation provides reliable results that show annualized costs are about 30 percent higher and that the main cost drivers are the high investment costs for buses and batteries. CO2 emissions have been reduced by at least two-thirds whereas the remaining emissions mainly result from the manufacturing of the batteries. Sensitivity analyses show that a carefully thought out matching of bus and battery lifetime is crucial in order to optimize both annual costs and emission savings. Due to the simplicity of the model, it can easily be adopted by other transport companies and yet high quality of results can be ensured while still relying on data derived from bus operation. © 2021 IEEE.","bus operation; electric buses; emissions; fleet electrification; public transport; sustainability; total cost of ownership","Buses; Carbon dioxide; Costs; Digital storage; Electric batteries; Sensitivity analysis; Smart city; Battery lifetime; Evaluation approach; Investment costs; Main cost driver; Public transport; Reliable results; System components; Transport companies; Cost benefit analysis",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85111569980

The installation in commercial ports of automatic mooring systems by means of vacuum suction cups, thus considerably reducing the time required to carry out ship mooring and unmooring maneuvers, is a factor that is considerably influencing the decrease in emissions of polluting gases in commercial ports with high traffic. The objective of the present work is to verify the influence of the use of the automatic mooring systems via vacuum suction cups on the emissions of polluting gases produced in the facilities destined to the traffic of container ships. To do this, two different calculation methods were used, Environmental Protection Agency and Environmental and Engineering Consultancy, to then compare the results of the two and thus obtain the reduction in emissions per twenty-foot equivalent unit in these terminals during mooring maneuvers. The paper concludes with a discussion on the values of the reductions in emissions obtained and the advantages of the installation of automatic mooring systems using vacuum suction cups in commercial ports located near population centers. © 2021 by the authors.

Climate change is expected to negatively affect the provision of these services, but the level of this impact is still unclear. Here we assess future climate change impact on the ecosystem services provided by the critically important páramos of the department of Boyacá in Colombia, of which over 25% of its territory is páramo. Methods: We first performed an extensive literature review to identify useful species of Boyacá, and selected 103 key plant species that, based on their uses, support the provision of ecosystem services in the páramos. We collated occurrence information for each key species and using a Mahalanobis distance approach we applied climate niche modelling for current and future conditions. Results: We show an overall tendency of reduction in area for all ecosystem services under future climate conditions (mostly a loss of 10% but reaching up to a loss of 40%), but we observe also increases, and responses differ in intensity loss. Services such as Food for animals, Material and Medicinal, show a high range of changes that includes both positive and negative outcomes, while for Food for humans the responses are mostly substantially negative. Responses are less extreme than those projected for individual species but are often complex because a given ecosystem service is provided by several species. As the level of functional or ecological redundancy between species is not yet known, there is an urgency to expand our knowledge on páramos ecosystem services for more species. Our results are crucial for decision-makers, social and conservation organizations to support sustainable strategies to monitor and mitigate the potential consequences of climate change for human livelihoods in mountainous settings.

Here we evaluate a new, comprehensive approach that incorporates interactions among multiple management strategies, land use/cover change, wildfire, and climate, although the potential effects of climate change are not evaluated in this study. The California natural and working lands carbon and greenhouse gas model (CALAND) indicates that summing individual practice estimates of greenhouse gas impacts may underestimate emission reduction benefits in comparison with an integrated estimate. Annual per-area estimates of the potential impact of specific management practices on landscape emissions can vary based on the estimation period, which can be problematic for extrapolating such estimates over space and time. Furthermore, the actual area of implementation is a primary factor in determining potential impacts of management on landscape emissions. Nonetheless, less intensive forest management, avoided conversion to urban land, and urban forest expansion generally create the largest annual per-area reductions, while meadow restoration and forest fuel reduction and harvest practices generally create the largest increases with respect to no management. CALAND also shows that data uncertainty is too high to determine whether California land is a source or a sink of carbon emissions, but that estimating effects of management with respect to a baseline provides valid results. Important sources of this uncertainty are initial carbon density, net ecosystem carbon accumulation rates, and land use/cover change data. The appropriate choice of baseline is critical for generating valid results. Copyright: © 2021 Di Vittorio et al.

The optimal THP temperature remains unclear due to the production of refractory compounds at high temperature. A compilation of literature data was conducted to investigate the existence of a temperature sweet spot for the THP applied to municipal sludge. All related reports (n = 43) were included. The THP temperature range impact was assessed in the range of 100 °C–200 °C on four AD and dewatering performance indicators (CH4 production, Volatile Solid Reduction (VSR), Dewaterability (DW) and filtrate quality). Other parameters potentially affecting the performance indicators were also considered. These parameters include the type of sewage sludge and operational conditions related to THP and AD. The impact of all parameters on performance indicators was evaluated with a Kruskal–Wallis statistical test. For THP temperature optimisation, a pairwise comparison, using a Wilcoxon test, was made. A temperature optimum in the [140–160] °C range was proposed. It seemed to minimize the production of refractory compounds, while maximising AD and dewatering performances. It is noteworthy that above 160 °C, the concentration in refractory compounds and soluble COD increases sharply, thus leading to a potential deterioration of WWTP effluent quality.

These anthropogenic-driven stressors, which operate cumulatively at varying spatial and temporal scales, are leading to ongoing and pervasive degradation of many marine ecosystems in the Pacific Island region. The effects of global warming and ocean acidification threaten much of the region and impact on the socio-cultural, environmental, economic and human health components of many Pacific Island nations. Simultaneously, resilience to climate change is being reduced as systems are overburdened by other stressors, such as marine and land-based pollution and unsustainable fishing. Consequently, it is important to understand the vulnerability of this region to future environmental scenarios and determine to what extent management actions can help protect, and rebuild ecosystem resilience and maintain ecosystem service provision. This Special Issue of papers explores many of these pressures through case studies across the Pacific Island region, and the impacts of individual and cumulative pressures on the condition, resilience and survival of ecosystems and the communities that depend on them. The papers represent original work from across the tropical Pacific oceanscape, an area that includes 22 Pacific Island countries and territories plus Hawaii and the Philippines. The 39 papers within provide insights on anthropogenic pressures and habitat responses at local, national, and regional scales. The themes range from coastal water quality and human health, assessment of status and trends for marine habitats (e.g. seagrass and coral reefs), and the interaction of local pressures (pollution, overfishing) with increasing temperatures and climate variability. Studies within the Special Issue highlight how local actions, monitoring, tourism values, management, policy and incentives can encourage adaptation to anthropogenic impacts. Conclusions identify possible solutions to support sustainable and harmonious environment and social systems in the unique Pacific Island oceanscape. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Cumulative pressures; Impacts; Oceanscape; Pacific region; Resilience","Acidification; Global warming; Landforms; Marine pollution; Sea level; Tropics; Water quality; Anthropogenic impacts; Anthropogenic pressures; Coastal water quality; Ecosystem resilience; Increasing temperatures; Land-based pollution; Ocean acidifications; Spatial and temporal scale; Ecosystems; climate resilience; coastal waters; coral reef; ecosystem resilience; extreme weather; greenhouse effect; habitat; Hawaii; human; human impact (environment); incentive; letter; nonhuman; ocean acidification; overfishing; Philippines; sea level rise; seagrass; tourism; climate change; ecosystem; environmental protection; fishery; Pacific islands; Pacific Ocean; pH; sea water; Climate Change; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Fisheries; Hawaii; Humans; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Pacific Islands; Pacific Ocean; Philippines; Seawater",Letter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101798060

However, differentials in access to these sensors could exacerbate existing inequalities in the ability of different communities to respond to the threat of air pollution. Objective: Our goal was to analyze patterns of deployments of a commonly used low-cost sensor, as a function of demographics and pollutant concentrations. Methods: We used Wilcoxon rank sum tests to assess differences between socioeconomic characteristics and PM2.5 concentrations of locations with low-cost sensors and those with regulatory monitors. We used Kolomogorov–Smirnov tests to examine how representative census tracts with sensors were of the United States. We analyzed predictors of the presence, and number of, sensors in a tract using regressions. Results: Census tracts with low-cost sensors were higher income more White and more educated than the US as a whole and than tracts with regulatory monitors. For all states except for California they are in locations with lower annual-average PM2.5 concentrations than regulatory monitors. The existing presence of a regulatory monitor, the percentage of people living above the poverty line and PM2.5 concentrations were associated with the presence of low-cost sensors in a tract. Significance: Strategies to improve access to low-cost sensors in less-privileged communities are needed to democratize air pollution data. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.","Environmental justice; EPA monitors; Low-cost air quality sensors; Public health; PurpleAir","air pollutant; air pollution; demography; environmental monitoring; human; particulate matter; United States; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Demography; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Particulate Matter; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105301839

For three-quarters of over 1,100 available monitoring stations, the average nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations decreased by at least 2.7 μg·m−3 (or 25%) compared with the average concentrations recorded during the same period of the previous seven years. This reduction was not specific to urban or rural areas because the relative reduction was of similar magnitude in both areas. The ozone (O3) response differed spatially, with positive anomalies in Northern Europe and negative anomalies in Southwestern Europe. Reduced cloudiness and related enhanced radiation in Northern Europe played a significant role in the increase of surface O3 concentrations by shifting the photochemical partitioning between NO2 and O3 toward more O3. The level of total oxidant (Ox = O3 + NO2) remained unchanged, except in Southwestern Europe where it decreased. Several episodes lasting a few days of a high level of total oxidants were observed in Northern Europe.

The results show that (1) the spillover effect is one of the reasons for distortions in the implementation of environmental regulations. Whether the influence of the spillover effect on the probability of local governments choosing the strategy of strict supervision is positive or negative depends on the environmental benefit of the local govern-ment’s environmental protection investment. (2) Increasing the reward for the enterprise’s complete green technology innovation behaviour is conducive to improving the probability of the enterprises choosing the strategy of complete green technology innovation, while it reduces the probability of local governments choosing the strategy of strict supervision. Increasing punishment for enter-prises’ incomplete green technology innovation behaviour is conducive to improving the probability of enterprises choosing the strategy of complete green technology innovation, but its impact on the probability of local governments choosing the strategy of strict supervision is uncertain due to the limitations of many factors. (3) Enterprises’ emission reduction capacity is positively related to the probability of the enterprises choosing the strategy of complete green technology innovation and is negatively related to the probability of local governments choosing the strategy of strict su-pervision.

The dominating impact in Northern Southeast Asia is due to El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO); in Indonesia, Northern Australia and South America is due to Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD); and in Southern China Land and Sea, Populated Northern China, Siberia, Northern and Arctic Eurasia, Central and Southern Africa, and Western US and Canada is due to North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). That NO2 pollution in Indonesia is modulated by IOD contradicts previous work claiming that the emissions in Indonesia are a function of El Nino impacting upon Aerosol Optical Depth and Fire Radiative Power. Simultaneous impacts of concurrent and lagged forcings are derived using multi-linear regression, demonstrating ENSO impacts future NO2 variability, enhancing NO2 emissions 7-88 weeks in the future, while IOD and NAO in some cases increase the emissions from or the duration of the future burning season as measured by NO2. This impact will also extend to co-emitted aerosols and heat, which may impact the climate. In all cases, lagged forcings exhibit more impact than concurrent forcings, hinting at non-linearity coupling with soil moisture, water table, and other dynamical effects. The regression model formed demonstrates that dynamical forcings are responsible for over 45% of the NO2 emissions variability in most non-urban areas and over 30% in urban China and sub-arctic regions. These results demonstrate the significance of climate forcing on short-lived air pollutants. © 2021 The Author(s).

The study also presents a sensitivity analysis of the NTE and WBW approach to key parameters such as window duration, torque, power, and exhaust aftertreatment thresholds. The analysis is performed on data collected from two heavy-duty diesel vehicles operated under real-world conditions in California over various routes that include a combination of urban and freeway type operation. The results presented show that only 10–30% of the total data meets the required exclusion criteria prescribed by the current NTE regulation. Reducing the NTE window duration from the existing 30 to 10 s increases the number of windows available to perform NTE analysis. The study also shows that exempting data that correspond to exhaust aftertreatment system (EATS) temperature threshold of below 250 °C is the most dominant parameter influencing the number of available windows in an urban-type operation. The WBW approach produces a rich collection of data points that are representative of the in-use emissions characteristic of the vehicle. The results of NOx vs CO2 using a 4-quadrant analysis from the WBW approach is indicative of a difference in engine manufacturer design and emissions control strategy pertaining to real-world operation. The results of the study show that revisions to the boundaries and exclusions to the NTE zone would contribute to broadening the scope of in-use assessment of heavy-duty vehicle operation. However, even with such modifications, the NTE may not apply to highly transient urban vocations such as delivery, refuse and transit bus vocations. While comparing the moving average WBW approach to the NTE, the former approach produces a significantly larger number of data points for in-use assessment. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Heavy-duty truck; In-use emissions; NTE; Off-cycle emissions; Oxides of nitrogen; Portable emission measurement system; Regulatory protocols; WBW","Automobile manufacture; Automobiles; Trucks; Heavy duty vehicles; Heavy-duty trucks; In-use emission; Not-to-exceed; Off-cycle emission; Oxides of nitrogen; Portable emission measurement system; Real-world emission; Regulatory protocol; Work-based-window; Sensitivity analysis; nitrogen; oxide; carbon dioxide; diesel; nitrous oxide; sensitivity analysis; threshold; traffic emission; air pollution control; Article; California; combustion; diesel engine; exhaust gas; government; highway; motor vehicle; Ontario; priority journal; sensitivity analysis; traffic; traffic pollution; urban area; urbanization; California; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102311470

However, they are often impacted by pathogen discharges via wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) and combined sewer overflows (CSO). To date, accurate predictions of the effects of future changes and pollution control measures on the microbiological water quality of rivers considering safe drinking water production are hindered due to the uncertainty of the pathogen source and transport variables. The aim of this study was to test an integrative approach for an improved understanding of these effects, i.e. climate change and population growth as well as enhanced treatment at WWTPs and/or prevention of CSOs. We applied a significantly extended version of QMRAcatch (v1.0 Python), a probabilistic-deterministic model that combines fate and transport modelling with quantitative microbial infection risk assessment. The impact of climatic changes until the period 2035–2049 was investigated by a conceptual semi-distributed hydrological model, based on regional climate model outputs. QMRAcatch was calibrated and validated using site- and source-specific data (human-associated genetic microbial source tracking marker and enterovirus). The study showed that the degree to which future changes affect drinking water safety strongly depends on the type and magnitude of faecal pollution sources and are thus highly site- and scenario-specific. For example, if the load of pathogens from WWTPs is reduced through enhanced treatment, climate-change driven increases in CSOs had a considerable impact. Preventing CSOs and installing enhanced treatment at the WWTPs together had the most significant positive effect. The simultaneous consideration of source apportionment and concentrations of reference pathogens, focusing on human-specific viruses (enterovirus, norovirus) and cross-comparison with bacterial and protozoan pathogens (Campylobacter, Cryptosporidium), was found crucial to quantify these effects. While demonstrated here for a large, wastewater-impacted river, the approach is applicable at other catchments and pollution sources. It allows assessing future changes and selecting suitable pollution control measures for long-term water safety planning. © 2020 The Authors","Climate change; Fate and transport model; Human-associated MST; Quantitative microbial risk assessment; Reference pathogens","Catchments; Climate change; Climate models; Combined sewers; Pathogens; Population statistics; Potable water; Quality control; Risk assessment; Rivers; Safety engineering; Sewage treatment plants; Viruses; Wastewater treatment; Water pollution control; Water quality; Water supply; Combined sewer overflows; Deterministic modeling; Microbial source tracking; Microbiological water quality; Regional climate modeling; Semi distributed hydrological models; Wastewater management; Wastewater treatment plants; River pollution; drinking water; catchment; drinking water; environmental fate; microbiology; modeling; pathogen; pollutant source; pollution control; risk assessment; river water; waste management; wastewater; water planning; water quality; Article; bacterium; calibration; Campylobacter; catchment area (hydrology); climate change; computer language; concentration (parameter); controlled study; Cryptosporidium; Enterovirus; environmental impact; hydrological model; infection risk; model; nonhuman; Norovirus; population growth; priority journal; probability; protozoon; quantitative analysis; risk assessment; simulation; validation process; waste water management; water pollution; water quality; water supply; animal; cryptosporidiosis; Cryptosporidium; environmental monitoring; human; microbiology; river; wastewater; water quality; Bacteria (microorganisms); Campylobacter; Cryptosporidium; Enterovirus; Norovirus; Protozoa; Animals; Cryptosporidiosis; Cryptosporidium; Drinking Water; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Rivers; Waste Water; Water Microbiology; Water Quality",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100148650

The amount of greenhouse gas emissions in coming decades will be consequential for global mean sea level (GMSL) on century and longer timescales through a combination of ocean thermal expansion and loss of land ice2. The Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS) is Earth’s largest land ice reservoir (equivalent to 57.9 metres of GMSL)3, and its ice loss is accelerating4. Extensive regions of the AIS are grounded below sea level and susceptible to dynamical instabilities5–8 that are capable of producing very rapid retreat8. Yet the potential for the implementation of the Paris Agreement temperature targets to slow or stop the onset of these instabilities has not been directly tested with physics-based models. Here we use an observationally calibrated ice sheet–shelf model to show that with global warming limited to 2 degrees Celsius or less, Antarctic ice loss will continue at a pace similar to today’s throughout the twenty-first century. However, scenarios more consistent with current policies (allowing 3 degrees Celsius of warming) give an abrupt jump in the pace of Antarctic ice loss after around 2060, contributing about 0.5 centimetres GMSL rise per year by 2100—an order of magnitude faster than today4.

A study was carried out to understand the effect of management strategies on the biodiversity, soil nutrient, and carbon stock of two community forests practiced by Jamatia (JCF) and Halam (HCF) tribes of Tripura, northeast India. The forest managed by Jamatia is community conserved, whereas the Joint Forest Management (JFM) regulation issued by the Government of India was implemented in Halam community-based forest. JCF showed higher tree diversity (2.741) than HCF (2.176), while there was no significant variation in the total number of species in these forests. Anogeissus acuminata, Schima wallichii, and Terminalia bellirica were the most dominant species in JCF and HCF. A relatively higher amount of organic matter, nitrogen, and phosphorus content was found in JCF soils. JCF showed higher carbon stock (342.9 Mg C ha–1) than HCF (158.7 Mg C ha–1). A positive and significant correlation of SOC concentration was observed with soil moisture, SOM, and soil nutrient content. The results show that both stands were at developmental stages; however, regular extraction of biomass from HCF was attributable to lower carbon stock. We found that the Jamatia communities are proactively involved in the conservation of forests and sustainable management of biodiversity under their control. The results reveal that the agent of management can play a vital role in enhancing tree diversity, soil properties, and carbon stock in community forests. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon stock; Community-conserved forests; Halam; Jamatia; Joint Forest Management; Sustainable forest management","Biodiversity; Carbon; Climate change; Magnesium; Nutrients; Soil moisture; Carbon sequestration; Climate change mitigation; Community-based forest managements; Developmental stage; Government of India; Joint forest managements; Management strategies; Sustainable management; Forestry; carbon; magnesium; nitrogen; organic matter; phosphorus; biodiversity; carbon sequestration; climate change; community resource management; conservation management; forest management; implementation process; indigenous population; regulatory framework; soil carbon; sustainability; Article; biodiversity; biomass; carbon sequestration; climate change; developmental stage; extraction; forest management; moisture; nonhuman; nutrient content; soil analysis; soil moisture; Terminalia bellirica; Tripura; vegetation; India; Tripura; Anogeissus acuminata; Schima wallichii; Terminalia bellirica",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104518199

While exurbanization may affect ecosystem services, its impact could be modulated by management decisions made by residents. We aimed to uncover how exurban residents in a midwestern county perceived ecosystem services and disservices provided by their property based on 26 semi-structured interviews of landowners on parcels between 1 and 20 acres with a pond in unincorporated areas. We found the ecosystem services people associated most with their land are classified as cultural services (dominated by recreation services), while the most common mentioned disservices were classified as regulating disservices. Many ecosystem services that would be categorized as supporting or regulating services were not mentioned by interviewees, including microclimate stabilization, carbon sequestration, disease regulation, and maintenance of genetic diversity. Residents spent an average of 1.4 h/acre each week managing their properties. However, as parcel size and forest cover increased, the residents reported managing less surface area. Our study suggested that residents cultivate landscape features that directly benefit them and view many of the services that benefit regional biodiversity and ecosystem processes as disservices, which, to rectify, may require coordinated landscape-level management or local policies/incentives. © 2021 by the authors.

Methods: This cross-sectional hospital-based study included 182,789 patients presenting between January 2016 and December 2019 hailing from the district of Hyderabad. Patients with a clinical diagnosis of MKC in at least one eye with an acute onset (≤1 week) of presentation were included as cases. Correlation analysis was performed with the local environmental temperature, rainfall, humidity, and windspeed (Telangana State Development and Planning Society) and air pollution (Central Pollution Control Board, Government of India). Results: Overall, 84 (0.05%) patients were diagnosed with acute onset MKC from the district of Hyderabad. The mean monthly prevalence in this cohort was 0.05% with peak prevalence in the months of July (0.08%), August (0.09%), September (0.12%), and October (0.08%). The environmental parameters of rainfall (r2 = 0.87/P = < 0.0001), humidity (r2 = 0.78/P = 0.0001), windspeed (r2 = 0.38/P = 0.0321) were significantly positively correlated and the air pollution parameters such as ground level ozone (r2 = 0.89/P = < 0.0001), particulate matter PM10 (r2 = 0.65/P = 0.0013), PM2.5 (r2 = 0.50/P = 0.0095), nitrogen dioxide (r2 = 0.53/P = 0.0071), and carbon monoxide (r2 = 0.69/P = 0.0008) were significantly negatively correlated with the temporal pattern of MKC in the population. Conclusion: Parasitic infections like MKC show a distinct temporal trend peaking during the monsoon season in the population. An increase in humidity, wind speed, and especially rainfall contributes to a higher prevalence of MKC cases during the year. An increase in ground-level ozone seems to be protective against infection. © 2021 Indian Journal of Ophthalmology | Published by Wolters Kluwer-Medknow.","Environmental pollution; India; microsporidial keratoconjunctivitis; trend analysis","air pollutant; air pollution; cross-sectional study; epidemiology; human; India; keratoconjunctivitis; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Cross-Sectional Studies; Humans; India; Keratoconjunctivitis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105116418

Herein, a strong heterojunction and highly efficient novel ternary nanocomposites Co@ZnSQDs/g-C3N4/MWCNT (Co-ZGM) with different mass ratios were successfully prepared by thermal impregnation technique. The synthesized materials were characterized by using analytical research instruments such as XRD, FTIR, DRS, XPS, SEM, FE-SEM, HR-TEM, EDX, BET surface area analysis, photoluminescence, and UV–vis spectroscopy. DRS result reveals that light absorption spectra are extended to the visible region. XPS study reveals that Co ion is successfully doped into ZnSQDs nanocatalyst. The EDX analysis shows that all relevant elements are present in our synthesized composite materials. The photodegradation results clearly indicate that 7 wt% Co@ZnSQDs/g-C3N4/MWCNT (7Co-ZGM) nanocomposite exhibits enhanced photocatalytic performance, and about 96% degradation of RhB dye was observed within 75 min. The remarkable improved photodegradation performance of 7Co-ZGM nanocomposite could be related to the high separation of electron-hole pairs (due to formation of heterojunction), proficient absorption of visible light, enlarged specific surface area, and strong redox ability of photoinduced charge carriers. Additionally, photo mineralization of paracetamol was also assessed by examining the reduction in total organic carbon (TOC) contents as a function of time over the most active 7Co-ZGM nanocomposite under visible light illumination. The quenching experiments were performed to know about the core reactive species involved in the photocatalytic degradation path. This study offers a simple, structurally controllable, effective, and significant route for the synthesis of visible light (low energy) active heterogeneous catalysts and highlights the importance of its potential for the degradation of environmental pollutants.

This new approach prompted a careful design of the NGVs catalytic aftertreatment system in order to minimize the catalytic converter carbon footprint as well as the unburned methane emissions at tailpipe. Here, a series of Pd/ CeO2 methane oxidation catalysts were prepared by an environmentally friendly solvent-free method and compared to the commercial wet-synthesized state-of-the-art catalysts. Their application in NGVs aftertreatment systems was evaluated by testing powder catalysts and coated monolith cores for CH4 oxidation and steam reforming, which are the main methane abatement reactions occurring in a three-way catalyst (TWC) under lean and rich conditions, respectively. Pd/CeO2 catalysts prepared by mechanochemical synthesis initially displayed superior activity compared to their counterpart obtained by conventional wet impregnation, especially under lean oxidation conditions, but appeared less resistant to the industrial aging process after core washcoating.

Here, we demonstrate a hydrogen sulphide (H2S)−induced product−targeting (HIPT) strategy for the coproduction of H2 and valuable chemical feedstocks from Na2S/Na2SO3 via overall H2S splitting using a MnxCd1−xS/CdyMn1−yS catalyst driven by visible light excitation. With this chemistry, 113 mmol g−1 h−1 of hydrogen evolution rate is achieved, surpassing most of the previously reported state-of-the-art photocatalyst, together with the production of value−added Na2S2O3 with nearly 100% selectivity. This work not only provides a good example for solar energy conversion via overall H2S splitting, but also offers new insights into the resource utilization of sacrificial donor (Na2S/Na2SO3) in various catalytic fields such as H2O splitting and CO2 reduction. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Hydrogen evolution; Overall H2S splitting; Sacrificial reagent conversion; Value−added chemical; “Dual−Solid−Solution” heterostructure","Catalysts; Energy conversion; Hydrogen production; Hydrogen sulfide; Manganese compounds; Sodium sulfide; Solar energy; Sulfur compounds; Chemical production; Chemicals productions; CO2 reduction; Hydrogen evolution rate; Resource utilizations; State of the art; Valuable chemicals; Visible light excitation; Cadmium compounds",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85096979527

We examined how land use change from native forest to either pasture [sown buffel (Cenchrus ciliaris cv. Biloela)] or cropping [primarily wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.)] affected total soil organic C (SOC) stocks as well as stocks of three SOC fractions, particulate organic C, humus organic C and resistant organic C. Furthermore, for the cropping system, we also examined whether the use of a ley pasture phase could reverse the loss of SOC. It was found that land use change from native forest to pasture decreased SOC stocks by 12.2 % and soil total N (STN) stocks by 24.6 % during the land development to pasture establishment (≤ 1.75 y), although there were no significant (P &gt; 0.05) changes thereafter up to 33 y and final values were generally similar to initial values. Furthermore, stocks of the three SOC fractions did not change with time in this pasture system. In contrast to these modest changes following conversion to pasture, for land use change to cropping, SOC decreased by 48 % at 0−0.1 m and 38 % (from 54 to 33 Mg ha−1) at 0−0.3 m, due mainly to insufficient C inputs to maintain SOM at steady state. Moreover, stocks of all three SOC fractions decreased with time, including the resistant organic C fraction, indicating that this fraction was not recalcitrant under cropping. The biomass C inputs by crops, mainly as root biomass, were not sufficient to reverse or slow down the rate of decrease of SOC in this soil. However, the introduction of pasture during the last 4 y indicated that the decreases in the stocks of SOC could be arrested by a ley pasture phase. © 2021","13δC; 15δN; C turnover; C3 forest; C4pasture; Soil nitrogen; Soil organic carbon","climate change; cropping practice; land use change; pasture; soil organic matter; sorghum; wheat; Australia; Cenchrus ciliaris; Matthiola; Sorghum bicolor; Triticum aestivum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099851619

There is an identified need to integrate sustainability objectives into national food policy and dietary recommendations. Research Aims: To (1) describe exploratory estimates of greenhouse gas emission factors for all infant and young child milk formula products and (2) estimate national greenhouse gas emission association with commercial milk formulas sold in selected countries in the Asia Pacific region. Method: We used a secondary data analysis descriptive design incorporating a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) concepts and methodology to estimate kg CO2 eq. emissions per kg of milk formula, using greenhouse gas emission factors for milk powder, vegetable oils, and sugars identified from a literature review. Proportions of ingredients were calculated using FAO Codex Alimentarius guidance on milk formula products. Estimates were calculated for production and processing of individual ingredients from cradle to factory gate. Annual retail sales data for 2012–2017 was sourced from Euromonitor International for six purposively selected countries; Australia, South Korea, China, Malaysia, India, Philippines. Results: Annual emissions for milk formula products ranged from 3.95–4.04 kg CO2 eq. Milk formula sold in the six countries in 2012 contributed 2,893,030 tons CO2 eq. to global greenhouse gas emissions. Aggregate emissions were highest for products (e.g., toddler formula), which dominated sales growth. Projected 2017 emissions for milk formula retailed in China alone were 4,219,052 tons CO2 eq. Conclusions: Policies, programs and investments to shift infant and young child diets towards less manufactured milk formula and more breastfeeding are “Triple Duty Actions” that help improve dietary quality and population health and improve the sustainability of the global food system. © The Author(s) 2021.","Asia; Australia; breast milk substitutes; carbon footprint; climate change; environmental analysis; environmental change; formula feeding; Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding; green-house gas; infant formula; nutrition policy",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101039263

Beef and dairy contribute over 70% of livestock greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), which collectively contribute ~6.3 Gt CO2-eq/year (Gerber et al., 2013; Herrero et al., 2016) and account for 14%–18% of human GHG emissions (Friedlingstein et al., 2019; Gerber et al., 2013). The utility of beef GHG mitigation strategies, such as land-based carbon (C) sequestration and increased production efficiency, are actively debated (Garnett et al., 2017). We compiled 292 local comparisons of “improved” versus “conventional” beef production systems across global regions, assessing net GHG emission data from Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies. Our results indicate that net beef GHG emissions could be reduced substantially via changes in management. Overall, a 46 % reduction in net GHG emissions per unit of beef was achieved at sites using carbon (C) sequestration management strategies on grazed lands, and an 8% reduction in net GHGs was achieved at sites using growth efficiency strategies. However, net-zero emissions were only achieved in 2% of studies. Among regions, studies from Brazil had the greatest improvement, with management strategies for C sequestration and efficiency reducing beef GHG emissions by 57%. In the United States, C sequestration strategies reduced beef GHG emissions by over 100% (net-zero emissions) in a few grazing systems, whereas efficiency strategies were not successful at reducing GHGs, possibly because of high baseline efficiency in the region. This meta-analysis offers insight into pathways to substantially reduce beef production's global GHG emissions. Nonetheless, even if these improved land-based and efficiency management strategies could be fully applied globally, the trajectory of growth in beef demand will likely more than offset GHG emissions reductions and lead to further warming unless there is also reduced beef consumption. © 2021 The Authors.

Nevertheless, high-resolution spatiotemporal variation of ambient sulfate across Taiwan Island still remained unknown because of the scarce monitoring sites. Thus, we developed a novel ensemble model named extreme gradient boosting coupled with geographically and temporally weighted regression (XGBoost-GTWR) to predict the high-resolution sulfate concentration (0.05°) based on satellite data, assimilated meteorology, and the output of chemical transport models (CTMs). The result suggested that XGBoost-GTWR model outperformed other five models in predicting the sulfate concentration with the highest R2 value (R2 = 0.58) and the lowest relative mean square error (RMSE = 1.96 μg/m3). Besides, the transferability of the XGBoost-GTWR model was also validated based on the ground-level sulfate data in 2019. The result suggested that the R2 value of the extrapolation equation (0.53) did not show notable decrease compared with the 10-fold cross-validation result (0.58), indicating that the model was robust to predict the sulfate concentration. The ambient sulfate concentration in Taiwan Island displayed featured spatial variation with the highest one in Southwest Taiwan and the lowest one in Northeast Taiwan, respectively. It was assumed that the higher anthropogenic emission combined with the adverse meteorological condition led to the higher sulfate level in the southwestern coastal region. The ambient sulfate concentration exhibited significantly seasonal variation with the highest value in spring (5.65 ± 0.84 μg/m3), followed by those in winter (5.45 ± 1.25 μg/m3) and autumn (4.60 ± 0.80 μg/m3), and the lowest one in summer (3.80 ± 0.65 μg/m3). The higher sulfate concentration in spring was mainly contributed by the dense biomass burning and scarce rainfall amount. The present study develops a novel model to capture the high-resolution sulfate map and provides basic data for effective regulations of air pollution and epidemiological studies. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH, DE part of Springer Nature.","Extreme gradient boosting; Geographically and temporally weighted regression; Sulfate; Taiwan Island","aerosol; anthropogenic source; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; concentration (composition); emission; epidemiology; estimation method; numerical model; seasonal variation; spatial variation; Taiwan; sulfate; aerosol; air pollutant; air pollution; environmental monitoring; human; island (geological); machine learning; particulate matter; Taiwan; Aerosols; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; Islands; Machine Learning; Particulate Matter; Sulfates; Taiwan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099756647

However, the long-term effects of biochar amendment on soil greenhouse gas (GHG) production and microbial community in forest ecosystems under projected warming remain highly uncertain. In this study, we conducted a 49-day incubation experiment to investigate the impact of biochar application on soil physico-chemical properties, GHG production rates, and microbial community at three temperature levels using a temperate forest soil amended with spruce biochar four years ago. Our results showed that temperature exerted a positive effect on soil CO2, CH4 and N2O production, leading to an increase in total global warming potential by 169% and 87% as temperature rose from 5 to 15 °C and from 15 to 25 °C, respectively, and thus a positive feedback to warming. Moreover, warming was found to reduce soil microbial biomass significantly, but at the same time promote the selection of an activated microbial community towards some phyla, e.g. Acidobacteria and Actinobacteria. We observed that biochar amendment reduced soil CH4 consumption and N2O production in the absence of litter by 106% and 94%, respectively, but did not affect soil CO2 production. While biochar had no significant influence of total global warming potential of forest soil, it could promote climate change mitigation by increasing the total soil carbon content by 26% in the presence of litter. In addition, biochar application was shown to enhance soil available phosphorus and dissolved organic carbon concentrations, as well as soil microbial biomass under a warmer environment. Our findings highlighted the potential of spruce biochar as a soil amendment in improving soil fertility and carbon sequestration in temperate forest over the long term, without creating any adverse climatic impacts associated with soil GHG production. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Biochar; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas; Litter; Temperate soils; Warming","Carbon dioxide; Ecosystems; Forestry; Global warming; Greenhouse gases; Microorganisms; Organic carbon; Climate change mitigation; Dissolved organic carbon; Global warming potential; Greenhouse gas production; Increasing temperatures; Microbial communities; Soil microbial biomass; Soil physico-chemical properties; Soils; biochar; carbon; carbon dioxide; charcoal; methane; nitrous oxide; organic carbon; phosphorus; unclassified drug; biochar; carbon dioxide; charcoal; nitrous oxide; biochar; climate effect; concentration (composition); dissolved organic carbon; fertilizer application; global warming; greenhouse gas; microbial community; soil amendment; soil fertility; soil temperature; temperate forest; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Article; Bacteroidetes; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; climate change; controlled study; forest soil; greenhouse effect; microbial biomass; microbial community; nonhuman; physical chemistry; Planctomycetes; Proteobacteria; soil amendment; soil fertility; soil property; spruce; temperate deciduous forest; temperature; Verrucomicrobia; agriculture; forest; greenhouse gas; microflora; soil; Acidobacteria; Actinobacteria; Agriculture; Carbon Dioxide; Charcoal; Forests; Greenhouse Gases; Microbiota; Nitrous Oxide; Soil; Temperature",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100421307

Hazard ratios between 1.30 and 1.90 were found for cardiovascular and respiratory mortality. OBJECTIVES: to estimate the individual life shortening among the exposed due to power plant emissions. DESIGN: survival for cardiovascular and respiratory disease in the exposed vs unexposed groups was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. For each gender and exposure, a fictitious cohort with a cumulative 30-year follow up was built combining three subcohorts of age at entry of 55-64, 65-74, and 75-84 years, with 10 years of follow up each. Survivals at 10 years in the 55-64-year subcohort were used as initial risks for 65-74-year subcohort; then, survivals at 10 years of the 65-74-year subcohort were used as initial risk in the 75-84-year subcohort. Eventually, 30-years cumulative follow up cohorts were obtained by gender and exposure. Individual life-shortening in people exposed was estimated as time from death of an exposed subject to the subsequent time when the unexposed cohort reached the same risk of the exposed subject at that time of the death. Here, it is proposed a method to take into account causes other than those considered. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: 144,018 subjects aged 55-74 years at entry of both genders belonging to the open cohort of residents of 12 municipalities (including Savona) from 2001 to 2013 in the area where the coal-fired power plant of Vado-Quiliano (Liguria Region, Northern Italy) is located. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: individual life shortening. RESULTS: after 5 years of follow up, the individual life shortening due to cardiorespiratory causes varied between 972 and 1,822 days for males and from 612 and 1,578 days among females. Taking into account other causes of death, reduces slightly (3% for males of 75 years at death) the estimate of life shortening found in this study. The comparison between the cohorts requires that the exposed and unexposed groups are comparable, except for the exposure, and that causes other than those considered are taken into account. Socioeconomic status had been found to have little effect on cause-specific death risk indicating that, at least in terms of socioeconomic status, the exposed and unexposed groups were similar. Taking into account causes other than those considered slightly reduced the found estimates (3% at age 75 in males). According to the proposal, the life-shortening for the considered causes is easy to calculate and provides an individual indicator of damage. Inferring from group statistics individual estimates could be the most controversial point of this approach. The proposed estimates are the most credible estimate of individual damage for each occurred death among the exposed people. CONCLUSIONS: an increased hazard ratio for a wide series of causes is equivalent to a life shortening among the exposed. A method to produce reasonable estimates of life-shortening is proposed as the effect of exposure at individual level. This approach is simple and do not require sophisticated statistical tools. It appears a promising approach for other settings.","coal fired power plant; individual life shortening; survival analysis","carbon; adverse event; aged; cardiovascular disease; cause of death; city; electric power plant; environmental exposure; epidemiology; female; human; Italy; male; middle aged; mortality; respiratory tract disease; very elderly; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Carbon; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cause of Death; Cities; Environmental Exposure; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Power Plants; Respiratory Tract Diseases",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110312928

In this work, we demonstrate AM for rapid development and testing for improved performance for the carbon dioxide reduction reaction across an evolution of vapor-fed reactor designs. In our final design, we observe activation- and mixed-control regimes for a variety of operating conditions via inlet CO2 flow rate and electrochemical potential. Furthermore, we define a dimensionless number (Da) to identify mass transport regimes by exploring the impact of hypothesized underlying mass transport mechanisms, including consumption of CO2via OH-, increased local temperatures, and partial penetration of electrolyte into gas diffusion layer. The accelerated pace of reactor design and development led to high geometric current densities (500 mA cm-2), heightened selectivity (85.5% FE C2+ products), and increased carbon dioxide conversion (16.6%) and cathodic energy efficiency (49.6% CO2R). Using AM vapor-fed reactors, we attain high ethylene (3.67%) and record ethanol (3.66%) yields compared to the literature.

Often adoption is investigated in isolation focusing on factors influencing farmer decision making and overlooking the effects of technology adoption on farmers’ livelihoods and perceptions of change. Therefore, the present study investigated technology adoption and its effects on farmers with a special focus on additional revenue allocation and perception of social, economic and environmental change. Using a digital survey platform, 153 farmers (21.6% female) were interviewed in three sub-districts of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. On average, farmers adopted two technologies or practices, adopted high-yielding rice varieties, and increased their revenue from US$105 to US$122 per hectare per season. Barriers to adoption included time constraints, unsuitability for field conditions and incompatibility with cropping systems. Farmers invested the extra income in farming business and improved diets. Furthermore, farmers perceived changes in social and human capital and also poverty reduction due to technology adoption.

Preserving and maintaining landscape connectivity is a potential strategy to support wildlife responding to these stressors. Using a novel model framework, we determined the population-level benefit of a set of identified potential corridors for spotted owl population viability. Location: Southern California, United States. Methods: Combining habitat suitability and dynamic metapopulation models, we compared the benefit of corridors to the Southern California spotted owl population, measured as the increase in the expected minimum abundance, both now and under a future climate. Our approach considered key corridor characteristics important to conservation decisions, namely corridor irreplaceability and local population network benefit. Results: We identified two corridors likely to increase Southern California spotted owl expected minimum abundance under current climate conditions. At the regional scale, of the 27 corridors evaluated, one corridor was irreplaceable (i.e., no other corridors in the network could provide a similar increase in abundance when the irreplaceable corridor was removed) and one corridor was identified as redundant (i.e., remaining corridors in the network can provide some of the increases in abundance offered by the removed corridor). Both putative corridors connected two large, populous and similarly sized patches. Additionally, we identified two more corridors at the local scale. We found that, under climate change, population declines may limit the benefit of connectivity for a range-restricted species like the spotted owl. Main conclusions: Our analytical approach highlights important criteria for corridor identification and prioritization, namely irreplaceability versus redundancy, local versus regional benefit, and corridor impact in a changing landscape. With the capability of incorporating estimated functional connectivity into population dynamics, our modelling framework advances connectivity decision-making for other species of conservation concern and archetypal taxa within ecological communities. © 2021 The Authors.

One of these countries is China, which has turned its focus to its own emission trading institutions, such as the ‘China Certified Emission Reduction’ (CCER) scheme, a domestic carbon offsetting mechanism. In this study, we analyse this mechanism by identifying the regional determinants of the emissions-reduction projects. We examine the distribution of 2789 projects of China Certified Emission Reduction scheme and use regional economic attributes to predict the number of projects in 30 Chinese Provinces. Results from a panel data analysis indicate that these projects are more likely to be implemented in locations where per capita GDP is lower, CO2 emissions is higher, energy intensity is higher, and the amount of domestic loan is larger. This voluntary carbon market in China continues to demonstrate economic sensitivity in project implementation as it moves towards a new governing system in the post-CDM context.

Lacustrine sediments within these lakes preserve a good record of these changes. However, determining their precise ages is difficult due to the complex nature of lake reservoir effects (LRE), which limit our understanding of paleoenvironmental changes. Focusing on an exposed 600 cm thick lacustrine sediment profile located in western Zhari Namco, we used a combination of both radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating methods in order to evaluate the carbon reservoirs of bulk organic matter (BOM) and aquatic plant remnants (APR), and to explore the age differences between 14C and OSL and their respective reliability. We demonstrated that (i) OSL ages were changed in stratigraphic order, and the OSL age just below the beach gravel layer was consistent with previously reported paleoshoreline ages; (ii) 14C ages were divergent between BOM and grass leaves; (iii) 14C ages of BOM were older than 14C ages of APR; and (iv) all 14C ages were older than OSL ages. This could be attributed to changing LRE in the past, causing the 14C ages to appear unstable during the deposition period. Although the 14C ages of terrestrial plant remnants (TPR) were not affected by LRE, an analyzed twig nonetheless returned a 14C age older than its respective layer’s OSL age, suggesting it may have been preserved on land prior to transportation into the lake. Our study suggests that OSL ages are more reliable than 14C ages with respect to Zhari Namco lacustrine sediments. We recommend caution when interpreting paleoenvironmental changes based on lacustrine sediment 14C ages alone. © Copyright © 2021 Cong, Wang, Zhang, Chen, Gao and An.","lacustrine sediments; lake reservoir effect; optically stimulated luminescence; radiocarbon dating; Tibetan Plateau","Lakes; Luminescence; Plants (botany); Reservoirs (water); Stratigraphy; Carbon reservoirs; Lacustrine sediments; Luminescence dating; Optically stimulated luminescence; Paleoenvironmental change; Regional climate; Reservoir effect; Terrestrial plants; Sediments; depositional environment; lacustrine environment; luminescence dating; paleoenvironment; radiocarbon dating; regional climate; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107547296

Most simulation models are not suited to assess the feasibility of middle and long-term goals under the price policies already in place. To fill this gap, this study applies a novel hybrid top-down-bottom-up dynamic macrosimulation model to the Italian economy (2015–2040). To incorporate uncertainty about the future costs of generation and storage technologies, fossil fuel prices, demand elasticities, macroeconomic performance and price incentives, we rely on exploratory model analysis to build scenarios from three clusters out of the 1000 different simulations. Our results suggest a decreasing trend in electricity prices in contrast to the latest official projections. Accordingly, the expansion of renewable energy slows down and none of the 1000 simulations reach the 2030 target of 55% renewable energy in electricity supply. Despite the ineffectiveness of the price subsidy policy in the first ten years (2021–2030), it is still crucial to reach very high penetration of variable renewable energy sources by 2040. © 2021","Electricity markets; Energy modelling; National energy and climate plans; Renewable energy policy paradox","Cost benefit analysis; Energy policy; Fossil fuels; Fuel storage; Investments; Power markets; Solar energy; Uncertainty analysis; Demand elasticities; Electricity prices; Electricity supply; Liberalized market; Renewable energies; Renewable energy policy; Storage technology; Variable renewable energies; Costs",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101915395

However, life cycle assessment (LCA) shows that technology choices and the benefits of CCU applied to MSWI depend on the energy system in which the MSWI operates throughout its lifetime, and on the markets for the CCU products. Carbon capture reduces up to 50% of the energy recovery of MSWI. We assessed different energy system scenarios, ranging from fossil- to non-fossil based. Direct utilisation of the captured CO2 is beneficial only on a local basis when substituting fossil-based CO2 (−700 kg CO2-eq/tonne waste), with benefits similar to carbon capture and storage. Hydrogenation of CO2 with the purpose of producing feedstock chemicals or fuels such as methane, methanol, dimethyl ether (DME) and formic acid provides much higher benefits (-2000 kg CO2-eq/tonne waste), but only in non-fossil-based energy systems, due to the dramatically high consumption of electricity (more than 6000 kWh/tonne waste). Use as feedstock chemicals provides more benefits than use as fuels, and CCU solutions focusing on methanol and DME are the most promising technologies. Although built on scarce and early-development data, the analysis highlights current crucial issues, at both the technological and system levels, for the future introduction of CCU in MSWI. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon capture; Carbon utilisation; Climate change; LCA; Waste incineration","Carbon capture; Carbon dioxide; Digital storage; Feedstocks; Fuel storage; Life cycle; Methanol; Methanol fuels; Municipal solid waste; Waste incineration; 'current; Carbon utilization; Climate change impact; Energy recovery; Energy systems; Hydrogenation of CO; Municipal solid-waste incinerations; System scenarios; Technological level; Technology choices; Climate change; carbon dioxide; chemical agent; dimethyl ether; feedstrock chemical; formic acid; fuel; methane; methanol; unclassified drug; carbon; carbon sequestration; climate change; climate effect; incineration; life cycle analysis; waste management; Article; carbon capture and utilization; carbon utilization; climate change; concentration (parameter); controlled study; electricity; energy; fossil; hydrogenation; incineration; life cycle assessment; municipal solid waste; solid waste management; technology; solid waste; Carbon; Climate Change; Incineration; Methane; Solid Waste",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104328487

To date, there has been no comprehensive assessment of the impact of lockdowns on air quality and human health. Using global satellite observations and ground measurements from 36 countries in Europe, North America, and East Asia, we find that lockdowns led to reductions in NO2 concentrations globally, resulting in ~32,000 avoided premature mortalities, including ~21,000 in China. However, we do not find corresponding reductions in PM2.5 and ozone globally. Using satellite measurements, we show that the disconnect between NO2 and ozone changes stems from local chemical regimes. The COVID-related lockdowns demonstrate the need for targeted air quality policies to reduce the global burden of air pollution, especially related to secondary pollutants.

Circulating fluidized bed systems have high capture performance, but an energy-efficient design is essential to reduce the CO2 capture cost. In this study, thermal-fluid characteristics of circulating fluidized bed with two-phase flow are analyzed, and thermal design is implemented. First, a laboratory-scale circulating fluidized bed system was used to investigate the relationship between hydrodynamics and heat transfer in experiments and numerical simulations. Numerical method predicted well the pressure fluctuations and local bed-to-wall heat transfer. Particle behaviors affected greatly the heat transfer. Accordingly, to control solid particle flow, the effect of reactor geometry on hydrodynamics and heat transfer was analyzed. Compared with the conventional circular reactor, the rectangular reactor had a secondary flow of solid particles in the horizontal section. Flow toward the narrow wall, and rotational flow near the corners, were identified. Intensity of the secondary flow depended on the aspect ratio. It was firstly reported that the geometry-induced secondary flow affected significantly heat transfer. Due to the strong secondary flow in the rectangular reactor, the local heat transfer was more than doubled. Ultimately, thermal design was carried out by analyzing the minimum temperature difference (MTD) according to the reactor geometry. The rectangular reactor showed an MTD of 67% compared to the circular reactor and 45% compared to the square reactor. Because MTD decreased and the coolant amount increased simultaneous with increasing aspect ratio, the rectangular reactor with an aspect ratio of 4:1 was the most energy-efficient design. Finally, through thermal design, the pilot-scale rectangular reactor is designed and under-constructed in order to evaluate the CO2 capture system performance and the potential for commercialization. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Circulating fluidized bed; CO2 capture; Geometry-induced secondary flow; Heat transfer; Thermal-fluid design","Aspect ratio; Carbon dioxide; Energy efficiency; Fluidized bed process; Fluidized beds; Geometry; Hydrodynamics; Numerical methods; Secondary flow; Two phase flow; Aspect-ratio; Capture system; Circulating fluidized bed; CO2 capture; Commercialisation; Fluidized bed system; Geometry-induced secondary flow; Minimum temperature differences; Thermal designs; Thermal-fluid design; Heat transfer",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102384211

Most of the studies investigating land use changes in the U.S. have not considered potential spatial effects explicitly. We used a two-step linearized multinomial logit to examine the impacts of various factors on conterminous U.S. land use changes including spatial lag coefficients. The estimation results show that the spatial dependences have existed for cropland, pastureland, and grasslands with a negative dependence on forests but weakened in most of the land uses except for croplands. Temperature and precipitation were found to have nonlinear impacts on the land use shares in the succeeding years by exerting opposite effects on crop versus pasture/grass shares. We also predicted land use changes under different climate change scenarios. The simulation results imply that the southern regions of the U.S. would lose cropland shares with further severity under the business-as-usual climate scenarios, while the land use shares for pasture/grass and forest would increase in those regions. As land use plays an important role in the climate system and vice versa, the results from this study may help policymakers tackle climate-driven land use changes and farmers adapt to climate change. © 2021 by the authors.

The dynamics of plane-one-dimensional shock waves with a stepped profile, the volumetric gas content of the gas in the gas-liquid medium, and the average density of the gas hydrate are shown. The situation is considered when in the initial state of the bubble mixture hydrate formation does not occur, but when exposed to a shock wave, due to an increase in pressure in the bubbles and their fragmentation, favorable conditions for hydrate formation are created at the interface. Also, the use of gas hydrate synthesis technologies creates prerequisites for solving the problem of the greenhouse effect on the planet, and hence the climate. One of the solutions may be an increase in the interphase surface upon contact between water and hydrate-forming gas.

Existing research has done a lot of work on the accounting methods and influencing factors of household direct CO2 emissions and indirect CO2 emissions. There are few studies on the impact of income inequality on direct and indirect household CO2 emissions under different emission levels. This research investigates the impact of income inequality on both direct and indirect CO2 emissions of 30 provinces in China from 2000 to 2015 using the STIRPAT model and panel quantile regression method. Theil index is selected to measure income inequality, population, per capita consumption level, energy intensity, urbanization, and industrial structure as control variables. The results indicate that the level of regional inequality is gradually increasing from the east to the west. The household indirect CO2 emissions in the east increased fastest, while the household direct CO2 emissions in the west increased fastest. Income inequality significantly promoted direct CO2 emissions under all quantile levels, while the impact on indirect CO2 emissions is not significant. Population and per capita consumption will promote direct and indirect CO2 emissions. Urbanization has no significant impact on direct CO2 emissions. Only at the 90th percentile level is there a significant negative correlation between energy intensity and indirect CO2 emissions. Industrial structure significantly increases direct CO2 emissions at the 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles, while the impact on indirect CO2 emissions is not significant.

The results showed that, compared with the non-aerobic group, the CH4 productivity increased by nearly 60% through aerobic pretreatment. More ammonium was obtained after pre-aeration, providing a suitable growth environment for methanogens. After the aerobic pretreatment, proteins and carbohydrates converted into solute protein and carbohydrate, which could be easily consumed by microorganisms, concentrations of solute protein and carbohydrate were 350 and 667 mg/L in R2 and Pre-R2, respectively. At the same time, aerobic pretreatment affected the distribution of microbial community in the system. In the stable stage of Pre-R2, Methanosarcina as acetate-utilizing methanogen, became the dominant in the reactor, whose abundance was over 93%. It meant after the aerobic pretreatment, the main pathway for methanogenesis was acetotrophy.

Market efficiency is a key indicator to uncover its current performance. Previous studies have revealed passed carbon market efficiency; however, given the dynamics of the market, it is worthy to track the up-to-date status. This paper, specifically, studies the Hubei pilot carbon market, which is quite interesting, considering its market scale, as well as the COVID-19 pandemic context. Wild bootstrapping Variance Ratio test is implemented to detect the market efficiency with the most recent and abundant data. Results show that the market efficiency in the period of 2014–2020 is around 0.3951, less than 1, suggesting a weak form of efficiency. Observing the sub-sample periods, the efficiency shows to be quite volatile: it climbes from 0.3621 to 0.4027 and finally drops to 0.3985.

We focus on technological progress, economic growth, and foreign direct investment (FDI) as threshold variables, and analyses the non-linear effects of environmental regulation on pollution emissions under those threshold variables, attempting to explore the effectiveness of existing environmental regulations. The structure of biased technological progress is based on the slacks-based measure (SBM) and Global-Malmquist–Luenberger index, which is divided into pollution-biased technology progress and clean-biased technology progress. Finally, we use the panel vector auto regressive (PVAR) algorithm to further verify the relationship. The findings are as follows: (1) Environmental regulation has a significant nonlinear effect on pollution emissions, and technological progress is the optimal threshold variable of this study. (2) Under the influence of these three factors, environmental regulation has a substitution effect on pollution discharge, and a stronger substitution effect on emission reduction in areas with advanced technology and high FDI. It also has a lower emission reduction effect in the high-system areas of economic development than in the low-system areas. (3) The PVAR results show that the impact on environmental regulation of technological progress and FDI has gradually turned from positive to negative; the impact of economic growth on environmental regulation has always been positive but is gradually decreasing. This study points out the direction for governments and companies to implement effective environmental regulations. © 2021 by the authors.

However, as a two-sided sword, the boosting of economic growth has inevitably exerted adverse effects on the environment in this region. To further understand the current fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution sources in this region and formulate an effective future air pollution control strategy for it, a hybrid source apportionment method was applied to adjust source estimates of secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs) [particulate sulfate (SO42−), nitrate (NO3−), and ammonium (NH4+)] by combining Comprehensive Air Quality Model Extensions and measurement data from 19 sampling sites covering the PRD region in 2015. After correction by the hybrid method, the normalized mean errors for the three major species SO42−, NO3−, and NH4+ in PM2.5 simulated by the model decreased from 0.412, 1.261, and 0.401 to 0.321, 0.565, and 0.130, respectively. Tianhu, Taishan, Taipa Grande, whose secondary inorganic aerosol concentration variations are −48.33%, −40.59%, and 39.10% after adjustment, respectively, are the three top sites with the most substantial modification. Our study revealed that the emissions outside the PRD region are still the most important contributor to the three components after the correction. In most Hong Kong sites, the adjusted mobile source is subordinate to the cross-boundary transport and became the largest endogenous source. In contrast to that in Hong Kong, preceded only by super-regional sources, the outstanding contributor to SIAs in Guangdong and Macao is the area source. Our results indicated that besides collaborative control measures, the Hong Kong and Guangdong government should emphasize the emissions from motor vehicles and residential sources, respectively. Overall, this hybrid source apportionment approach can narrow down the discrepancy between simulation results and observational data. Thus, it is a potentially reliable method to provide a more solid theoretical foundation for formulating air pollution control measures. © 2021 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Air pollution; CAMx-PSAT; Hybrid source apportionment; PRD region; Secondary inorganic aerosol",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105508940

Both PHBCs exhibit low energy gaps, as reflected by UV-vis-NIR absorption and electrochemical measurements. They also show open-shell singlet ground states according to electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The use of fully benzenoid HBC as a bridging moiety leads to significant singlet biradical characters (y0) of 0.72 and 0.96 for mPHBC 8 and pPHBC 16, respectively, due to the strong rearomatization tendency of the HBC π-system; these values are among the highest for planar carbon-centered biradical molecules. The incorporation of fully unsaturated pentagons strongly perturbs the aromaticity of the parent HBC and makes the constituted benzene rings less aromatic or antiaromatic. These results illustrate the high impact of cyclopentaannelation on the electronic structures of fully benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and open up a new avenue towards open-shell PAHs with prominent singlet biradical characters. © 2021 The Authors.

Herein, we first present a study for CO2 conversion on Pb-free halide perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 under state-of-the-art first-principles calculation with dispersion correction. Compared with the previous CsPbBr3, the cell parameter of Cs2AgBiBr6 underwent only a small decrease of 3.69%. By investigating the adsorption of CO, CO2, NO, NO2, and catalytic reduction of CO2, we found Cs2AgBiBr6 exhibits modest adsorption ability and unsatisfied potential determining step energy of 2.68 eV in catalysis. We adopted defect engineering (Cl doping, I doping and Br-vacancy) to regulate the adsorption and CO2 reduction behavior. It is found that CO2 molecule can be chemically and preferably adsorbed on Br-vacancy doped Cs2AgBiBr6 with a negative adsorption energy of −1.16 eV. Studying the CO2 reduction paths on pure and defect modified Cs2AgBiBr6, Br-vacancy is proved to play a critical role in decreasing the potential determining step energy to 1.25 eV. Finally, we probe into the electronic properties and demonstrate Br-vacancy will not obviously promote the process of catalysis deactivation, as there is no formation of deep-level electronic states acting as carrier recombination center. Our findings reveal the process of gas adsorption and CO2 reduction on novel Pb-free Cs2AgBiBr6, and propose a potential strategy to improve the efficiency of catalytic CO2 conversion towards practical implementation. © 2021 by the authors.

However, whether the nonattainment assignment is the underlying cause of the county’s reductions in PM2.5 requires further empirical investigation. Traditional statistical approaches used to study the impact of nonattainment designation on air quality present problems involving indeterministic covariates, confoundedness, model misspecification, and undetected effects at the aggregate level. Our study successfully uses the Panel Data Approach for Program Evaluation (PAMPE) to compare the differences between the actual outcomes and counterfactual outcomes to reveal the treatment effects associated with nonattainment assignment without the burden associated with previous studies. Our results show that, at the monitor level, the air quality improvements obtained by the more-polluted areas were greater after LA County was designated as a nonattainment area. On average, the counterfactual reduction rates derived in our study range from − 0.01 to − 0.15%. Cases in which PM2.5 levels increased occurred at two monitors that were fully or partially compliant during the study period, suggesting the regulatory oversight is indeed spatially heterogeneous. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Counterfactual baseline; Los Angeles County; Nonattainment status; Panel data approach for program evaluation; PM2.5; Treatment effect","air quality; atmospheric pollution; concentration (composition); life cycle analysis; particulate matter; spatiotemporal analysis; California; Los Angeles County; United States; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85089013029

However, how to evaluate them in the real driving emission (RDE) test is controversial. Although the Commission Regulation (EU) 2017/1154 and 2018/1832 successively adopt the moving averaging window (MAW) method and the cumulative averaging (CA) method to calculate the emission factors that include the cold-start emissions in the RDE tests, both the methods have been found to be flawed when processing the RDE data including cold-starts. To demonstrate the problem, the RDE test data from three light-duty gasoline vehicles were comparatively analyzed using the MAW method and the CA method. Results reveal that the MAW method unreasonably underestimates cold-start emissions in the urban and total trip emission evaluation, and the CA method tends to increase the inconsistency of the RDE evaluation results. Considering the inherently different characteristics between the cold-start emissions and the non-cold-start emissions, this paper proposes that the entire RDE test trip should be divided into a cold-start trip and a non-cold-start trip, and the cold-start emissions are evaluated by the CA method while the non-cold-start emissions are evaluated by the MAW method. Furthermore, the pollutant emission factors in the cold-start trip are corrected referring to the CO2 emissions emitted during the cold-start period of Worldwide harmonized Light vehicles Test Cycle (WLTC). Using this proposed approach, the aforementioned RDE tests were further analyzed and evaluated again. It is verified that the consistency of the test evaluation results in the RDE tests can be improved. The results of this study could be used to improve future emission regulations for the more reasonable evaluation of cold-start emissions in RDE tests. © 2021 Turkish National Committee for Air Pollution Research and Control","Cold-start emissions; Data analysis methods; Emission factors; Emission regulations; Moving averaging window (MAW); PEMS",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104982355

However, the potential role of plant carbon input in regulating the multi-layer SOM preservation over broad geographic scales remains unclear. Based on large-scale soil radiocarbon (∆14C) measurements on the Tibetan Plateau, we found that plant carbon input was the major contributor to topsoil carbon destabilisation despite the significant associations of topsoil ∆14C with climatic and mineral variables as well as SOM chemical composition. By contrast, mineral protection by iron–aluminium oxides and cations became more important in preserving SOM in deep soils.

Many large pithead coal-fired power plants are being operated in the coal-rich Huainan and Huaibei coalfields in northern Anhui. To assess the environmental risks of local coal-fired power plants, a complete atmospheric emission inventory of F, As, Se, Cd, Sb, Hg, Pb, and U from coal-fired power plants in Anhui was compiled by a simple mass-balance-based method. The results indicated that the atmospheric emissions of F, As, Se, Cd, Sb, Hg, Pb, and U in 2017 from the Anhui coal-fired power plants were 578 t, 2.01 t, 15.3 t, 0.57 t, 0.18 t, 2.80 t, 23.7 t, and 0.099 t, respectively. The emission factor is the major contributor to the uncertainties in this inventory.

Because remote sensing data enable automated LCZ mapping on a large scale, there is a need to evaluate how well remote sensing resources can produce fine LCZ maps to assess urban thermal environments. In this study, we combined Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery and dual-polarized (HH + HV) PALSAR-2 data to generate LCZ maps of Nanchang, China using a random forest classifier and a grid-cell-based method. We then used the classifier to evaluate the importance scores of different input features (Sentinel-2 bands, PALSAR-2 channels, and textural features) for the classification model and their contribution to each LCZ class. Finally, we investigated the relationship between LCZs and land surface temperatures (LSTs) derived from summer nighttime ASTER thermal imagery by spatial statistical analysis. The highest classification accuracy was 89.96% when all features were used, which highlighted the potential of Sentinel-2 and dual-polarized PALSAR-2 data. The most important input feature was the short-wave infrared-2 band of Sentinel-2. The spectral reflectance was more important than polarimetric and textural features in LCZ classification. PALSAR-2 data were beneficial for several land cover LCZ types when Sentinel-2 and PALSAR-2 were combined. Summer nighttime LSTs in most LCZs differed significantly from each other. Results also demonstrated that grid-cell processing provided more homogeneous LCZ maps than the usual resampling methods. This study provided a promising reference to further improve LCZ classification and quantitative analysis of local climate. © 2021 by the authors.

In this study, we used satellite derived near-infrared reflectance of vegetation (NIRv) data to map Topt of vegetation productivity at the spatial resolution of 0.1° on the Tibetan Plateau (TP), one of most sensitive regions in the climate system. The average Topt of non-forest vegetation on the TP is about 14.7°C, significantly lower than the Topt value used in current ecosystem models. A remarkable geographical heterogeneity in Topt is observed over the TP. Higher Topt values generally appear in the north-eastern TP, while the south-western TP has relatively lower Topt (&lt;10°C), in line with the difference of climate conditions and topography across different regions. Spatially, Topt tends to decrease by 0.41°C per 100 m increase in elevation, faster than the elevational elapse rate of growing season temperature, implying a potential CO2 regulation of Topt in addition to temperature acclimation. Topt increases by 0.66°C for each 1°C of rising mean annual temperature as a result of vegetation acclimation to climate change. However, at least at the decadal scale, there is no significant change in Topt between 2000s and 2010s, suggesting that the Topt climate acclimation may not keep up with the warming rate. Finally, future (2091–2100) warming could be close to and even surpass Topt on the TP under different RCP scenarios without considering potential climate acclimation. Our analyses imply that the temperature tipping point when the impact of future warming shifts from positive to negative on the TP is greatly overestimated by current vegetation models. Future research needs to include varying thermal and CO2 acclimation effects on Topt across different time scales in vegetation models. © 2021 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.","elevational dependence; geographical heterogeneity; near-infrared reflectance of vegetation; optimal temperature; thermal acclimation; Tibetan Plateau","acclimation; climate effect; global change; satellite data; satellite imagery; temperature effect; temperature profile; vegetation dynamics; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau; climate change; ecosystem; season; temperature; Tibet; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Seasons; Temperature; Tibet",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101150254

Parallel measurements were performed with an aethalometer, an ultrafine particle monitor and a suite of instruments to monitor regulated pollutants (PM2:5, PM10, NOx, O3 and SO2). The average PM1 chemical composition over the period was dominated by organic aerosol (OA; 49.7 %) and black carbon (BC; 17.1 %), while sulfate accounted for 14.6 %, nitrate for 10.2 %, ammonium for 7.9 % and chloride for 0.5 % only. Wintertime was found to be the season contributing the most to the annual PM1 mass concentration (30 %), followed by autumn (26 %), summer (24 %) and spring (20 %). During this season, OA and BC concentrations were found to contribute 32 % and 31 % of their annual concentrations, respectively, as a combined result of heavy urban traffic, high emissions from residential heating and low planetary boundary layer (PBL) height. Most (75 %) of the 15 days exceeding the target daily PM2:5 concentration value recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) occurred during this season. Local and long-range pollution episodes with contrasting chemical composition could be distinguished, accounting for 40 % and 60 % of the exceedance days, respectively. Enhanced OA and BC concentrations, mostly originating from domestic wood burning under nocturnal land breeze conditions, were observed during local pollution episodes, while high levels of oxygenated OA and inorganic nitrate were associated with medium-/long-range transported particles. In summertime, substantially higher concentrations of sulfate were found, with an average and a maximum contribution to the PM1 mass of 24 % and 66 %, respectively. Results from k-means clustering analysis of daily profiles of sulfate concentrations clearly reveal the significant influence of local harbour/industrial activities on air quality in addition to the more regional contribution of shipping traffic that originates from the Mediterranean basin. © 2021 Author(s).",,"aerosol; atmospheric dynamics; atmospheric pollution; chemical composition; concentration (composition); pollution monitoring; real time; seasonal variation; France; Varanidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105872509

Yet, especially in mountain ecosystems with complex topography, missing edaphic and habitat components may be detrimental for a sound understanding of biodiversity distribution. Here, we compare the relative importance of climate, soil and land cover variables when predicting the distributions of 2,616 vascular plant species in the European Alps, representing approximately two-thirds of all European flora. Using presence-only data, we built point-process models (PPMs) to relate species observations to different combinations of covariates. We evaluated the PPMs through block cross-validations and assessed the independent contributions of climate, soil, and land cover covariates to predict plant species distributions using an innovative predictive partitioning approach. We found climate to be the most influential driver of spatial patterns in plant species with a relative influence of ~58.5% across all species, with decreasing importance from low to high elevations. Soil (~20.1%) and land cover (~21.4%), overall, were less influential than climate, but increased in importance along the elevation gradient. Furthermore, land cover showed strong local effects in lowlands, while the contribution of soil stabilized at mid-elevations. The decreasing influence of climate with elevation is explained by increasing endemism, and the fact that climate becomes more homogeneous as habitat diversity declines at higher altitudes. In contrast, soil predictors were found to follow the opposite trend. Additionally, at low elevations, human-mediated land cover effects appear to reduce the importance of climate predictors. We conclude that soil and land cover are, like climate, principal drivers of plant species distribution in the European Alps. While disentangling their effects remains a challenge, future studies can benefit markedly by including soil and land cover effects when predicting species distributions. © 2020 The Authors.

Mining operations contribute a substantial amount of dust emission at the crushing, screening, and bulk material handling in loading areas. The ambient suspended dust particles create a severe nuisance to workers and local dwellers. For effective controlling of positive dust emission, an innovative automated dry fog dust suppression system (DFDSS) has been developed using hybrid nozzles, sensors, actuators, controllers, screw compressors, air receivers, pumps, motors, and water arrangement with filtration facility. The DFDSS was installed in a crushing and screening plant of an iron ore mine in India. Performance study indicted fugitive dust emission concentration values ranged from 354 to 7040 μg m−3, which was reduced to 91–300 μg m−3 after installation of DFDSS. The reduced values were within the permissible limit of 1200 μg m−3 at a distance of 25 ± 2 m in the predominant downwind direction. The installed DFDSS added a meager addition of moisture content of 0.032% in the handling iron ore material, which was below the acceptable limit of 0.1%. The DFDSS precisely regulated fugitive dust emission from various mining activities without affecting the minerals processing performance. Thus, the DFDSS can be implemented effectively in different mining and allied industries where there is a dust emission problem. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Dry fog system; Dust suppression; Fugitive dust emission; Hybrid nozzle; Moisture addition in handling ore","water; atmospheric pollution; crushing; dust; emission control; equipment; fog; industrial emission; installation; performance assessment; air pollution control; Article; compressed air; concentration (parameter); controlled study; dust; field study; filtration; fluid intake; fog; materials handling; maximum permissible dose; moisture; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; suspended particulate matter; air pollutant; air pollution; dust; environmental monitoring; human; India; mining; prevention and control; India; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Dust; Environmental Monitoring; Humans; India; Mining",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100698973

However, a systematic investigation on the nature of interactions between metals and MES is still lacking. To investigate this nature, we integrated a copper electrocatalyst, converting CO2 to formate, with microorganisms, converting CO2 to acetate. A co-catalytic (i. e. metabolic) relationship was evident, as up to 140 mg L−1 of formate was produced solely by copper oxide, while formate was also evidently produced by copper and consumed by microorganisms producing acetate. Due to non-metabolic interactions, current density decreased by over 4 times, though acetate yield increased by 3.3 times. Despite the antimicrobial role of copper, biofilm formation was possible on a pure copper surface. Overall, we show for the first time that a CO2-reducing copper electrocatalyst can be combined with MES under biological conditions, resulting in metabolic and non-metabolic interactions. © 2021 The Authors.

The acclimation process is mainly driven by epigenetic regulation, including structural and chemical modifications on the genome that do not affect the nucleotide sequence. In plants, one of the best-known epigenetic mechanisms is cytosine-methylation. We evaluated the impact of 30% reduced rainfall (hereafter “drought” treatment; D), 3 °C increased air temperature (“warming”; W), and the combination of D and W (WD) on the phenotypic and epigenetic variability of Hordeum murinum subsp. leporinum L., a grass species of high relevance in Mediterranean agroforestry systems. A full factorial experiment was set up in a savannah-like ecosystem located in southwestern Spain. H. murinum exhibited a large phenotypic plasticity in response to climatic conditions. Plants subjected to warmer conditions (i.e., W and WD treatments) flowered earlier, and those subjected to combined stress (WD) showed a higher investment in leaf area per unit of leaf mass (i.e., higher SLA) and produced heavier seeds. Our results also indicated that both the level and patterns of methylation varied substantially with the climatic treatments, with the combination of D and W inducing a clearly different epigenetic response compared to that promoted by D and W separately. The main conclusion achieved in this work suggests a potential role of epigenetic regulation of gene expression for the maintenance of homoeostasis and functional stability under future climate change scenarios. © 2021, The Author(s).",,"acclimation; adaptation; barley; climate change; climate modeling; environmental conditions; experimental study; gene expression; genetic analysis; phenotypic plasticity; plant community; Spain; Hordeum murinum subsp. leporinum; animal; climate change; ecosystem; genetic epigenesis; genetics; hare; Hordeum; Animals; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Epigenesis, Genetic; Hares; Hordeum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101265163

A framework that stimulates sub- and non-state action is a necessary complement to national governmental action, as the latter falls short of achieving low-carbon and climate-resilient development as envisaged in the Paris Agreement. Applying design principles for an ideal-type orchestration framework, we review literature and gather expert judgements to assess whether the GCAA has been collaborative, comprehensive, evaluative and catalytic. Results show that there has been greater coordination among orchestrators, for instance in the organization of events. However, mobilization efforts remain event-driven and too little effort is invested in understanding the progress of sub- and non-state action. Data collection has improved, although more sophisticated indicators are needed to evaluate climate and sustainable development impacts. Finally, the GCAA has recorded more action, but relatively little by actors in developing countries. As the world seeks to recover from the COVID-19 crisis and enters a new decade of climate action, the GCAA could make a vital contribution in challenging times by helping governments keep and enhance climate commitments; strengthening capacity for sub- and non-state action; enabling accountability; and realizing sustainable development. © 2021 The Authors.

Despite recent modification in the rice-parboiling boiler, the amount of stack emission (especially particulate matter) from local rice parboiling industry is still considerably high to jeopardize public health and environmental sustainability. There is no provision of flue gas cleaning in these industries since flue gas cleaning often requires significant investment, complicated installation and heavy-maintenance. Therefore, a modified flue gas cleaning system, namely Ash removal unit (ARU) was designed for simultaneously and synergistically removing particulate matter (PM), SO2, NOx, CO2 and heat from flue gas of local rice parboiling industries. In this study, ARU was incorporated in a local rice parboiling industry in order to evaluate the co-removal efficiency achieved by the ARU. Installation of ARU eliminated PM from flue gas by 91.8%, while it removed 78.5% SO2, 78.3% NOx and 23.9% CO2 respectively from the emitting stack. Other than flue gas cleaning, ARU also facilitates heat exchange between flue gas and boiler feed water. Hence, flue gas temperature was dropped by 42.1%, while boiler feed water temperature was raised by 36% in 30 min. Moreover, adopting ARU also improved the ambient air quality surrounding the industrial area, since it reduced SO2, NOx, SPM, PM2.5 and PM10 level in ambient air by 81.7%, 78.2%, 21.1%, 22.9% and 43.1% respectively. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Co-removal of PM, SO2, CO2 and NOx; Emission control; Flue gas cleaning; PM removal","carbon dioxide; nitrate; sulfate; air quality; ambient air; ash; particulate matter; pollutant removal; public health; rice; water temperature; ambient air; Article; ash; boiler; cleaning; energy recovery; flue gas; parboiling; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; rice; water temperature; air pollutant; Bangladesh; heat; Oryza; particulate matter; Bangladesh; Air Pollutants; Bangladesh; Hot Temperature; Oryza; Particulate Matter",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101385918

Although this process can, in principle, alter surface evaporation due to the coupling between plant water loss and carbon uptake, with the potential to change the surface temperature, aerosol-climate interactions have been traditionally viewed in light of the radiative effects within the atmosphere. Here, we develop a modeling framework that combines global atmosphere and land model simulations with a conceptual diagnostic tool to investigate these interactions from a surface energy budget perspective. Aerosols increase the terrestrial evaporative fraction, or the portion of net incoming energy consumed by evaporation, by over 4% globally and as much as ∼40% regionally. The main mechanism for this is the increase in energy allocation from sensible to latent heat due to global dimming (reduction in global shortwave radiation) and slightly augmented by diffuse radiation fertilization. In regions with moderately dense vegetation (leaf area index &gt;2), the local surface cooling response to aerosols is dominated by this evaporative pathway, not the reduction in incident radiation. Diffuse radiation fertilization alone has a stronger impact on gross primary productivity (+2.18 Pg C y−1 or +1.8%) than on land evaporation (+0.18 W m−2 or +0.48%) and surface temperature (−0.01 K). Our results suggest that it is important for land surface models to distinguish between quantity (change in total magnitude) and quality (change in diffuse fraction) of radiative forcing for properly simulating surface climate. © 2021.

Here, using a fusion of satellite and reanalysis products, we examine this coupling through changes in the surface energy budget during the lockdown (1 April to 15 May 2020) in the Indo-Gangetic Basin, one of the world's most populated and polluted regions. During the lockdown, the reduction (>10%) in columnar air pollution compared to a five year baseline, expected to increase incoming solar radiation, was counteracted by a ∼30% enhancement in cloud cover, causing little change in available energy at the surface. More importantly, the delay in winter crop harvesting during the lockdown increased surface vegetation cover, causing almost half the regional cooling via evapotranspiration. Since this cooling was higher for rural areas, the daytime surface urban heat island (SUHI) intensity increased (by 0.20-0.41 K) during a period of reduced human activity. Our study provides strong observational evidence of the influence of agricultural activity on rural climate in this region and its indirect impact on the SUHI intensity. © 2021 The Author(s).

BTEX were monitored using passive samplers during two sampling seasons (rainy 2019 and cold dry 2020), and samples were analyzed by gas chromatography with flame ionization detection. BTEX ratios and meteorological analysis suggested that the concentrations were mainly influenced by vehicular and local sources located to the SE of the study area. The sum of average concentrations of BTEX in rainy and cold dry seasons were of 3.52 ± 0.36 µg m-3 and 4.11 ± 0.38 µg m-3, respectively. Mean concentrations were of 0.74, 1.59, 0.48, and 0.69 µg m-3, for benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and p-xylene, respectively. The highest levels of BTEX were found in sites with an urban land-use type of medium-intensity industrial zones with high population density. The lower BTEX concentrations found during the rainy season were probably due to higher solar radiation and temperatures that favored their photochemical degradation. Bi-variate and multivariate analysis showed that the BTEX species were strongly correlated with each other and with temperature and solar radiation, indicating that they originated from common sources. Benzene and toluene correlated strongly with CO and SO2, indicating that they could originate from vehicular exhaust emissions and high-sulfur fuel combustion sources. The health risk assessment showed that the Leon city adult population is at possible risk of developing cancer in their lifetime due to exposure to the measured benzene levels, but indicated no risk of contracting respiratory and cardiovascular diseases due to inhalation of BTEX. The results suggest the need for BTEX emissions reduction policies in the study area, as well as the establishment of a Mexican standard that regulates the maximum permissible limit of these pollutants in ambient air in order to protect the health of the population. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.","Air quality; BTEX; Guanajuato; Leon; Mexico; Passive samplers; Urban air","ambient air; BTEX; concentration (composition); health risk; pollutant source; pollution exposure; population density; seasonal variation; spatiotemporal analysis; urban pollution; Bajio; Guanajuato; Leon [Nicaragua]; Leon [Nicaragua]; Mexico [North America]; Nicaragua",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102527119

Here we present the results of an accompanying analysis of the impacts of zero waste strategies on greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions associated with waste treatment. Emissions analysis in the waste sector is complicated by the contribution of significant indirect impacts that can exhibit temporal and spatial heterogeneity. For example, lifecycle GHG analysis of waste-to-energy combustion grants credits for the emissions avoided due to electricity generated from organic waste (biogenic carbon) that displaces electricity generation that could be carbon-emitting. As electricity grids decarbonize, this credit approaches zero. Long-term emissions planning needs to account for such dynamics to realistically assess the GHG mitigation potential associated with alternative waste management strategies. Here, we seek to capture these dynamics in a forward-looking analysis of waste sector emissions under a zero-waste strategy for the City of Boston. Using publicly available data sets such as EPA's Waste Reduction Model (WARM), we show that the implementation of zero waste strategies reduces the combustion of plastics and biomass in waste-to-energy (WtE) combustion facilities and associated GHG emissions. While WtE has been considered less-carbon intensive than other forms of waste treatment and fossil-based electricity generation, our analysis shows that more renewables will eventually eliminate the perceived GHG benefits associated with waste-to-energy combustion. While our approach provides policymakers with an understanding of the impacts of decisions in a dynamic context, we also identify common knowledge gaps in conducting forward-looking waste-GHG assessments. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Emissions; Life cycle assessment; Planning; Zero waste","Carbon; Electric power generation; Greenhouse gases; Life cycle; Particulate emissions; Waste incineration; Waste treatment; Dynamic condition; Electricity-generation; Emission; Emission reduction; Forward looking; Greenhouse gas emissions; Greenhouses gas; Waste strategies; Waste to energy; Zero waste; Planning; carbon; plastic; alternative energy; electricity generation; emission control; emission inventory; greenhouse gas; life cycle analysis; organic pollutant; policy implementation; policy making; strategic approach; waste management; Article; biomass; carbon footprint; case study; city; combustion; dynamics; electricity; environmental impact assessment; environmental planning; fossil energy; life cycle assessment; Massachusetts; organic waste; priority journal; renewable energy; waste management; waste-to-energy plant; zero waste strategy; gas; greenhouse effect; Boston; Massachusetts; United States; Boston; Gases; Greenhouse Effect; Massachusetts; Waste Management",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102967336

PCMs belong to the category of passive systems that operate on heat modulation, thanks to latent heat storage (LHS) that can lead to a reduction of heating ventilation air conditioning (HVAC) consumption in traditional buildings and to an improvement of indoor thermal comfort in buildings devoid of HVAC systems. The aim of this work is to numerically analyze and compare the benefits of the implementation of PCMs on the building envelope in both active and passive strategies. To generalize the results, two different EnergyPlus calibrated reference models— the small office and the midrise apartment—were considered, and 25 different European cities in different climatic zones were selected. For these analyses, a PCM plasterboard with a 23◦ C melting point was considered in four different thicknesses—12.5, 25, 37.5, and 50 mm. The results obtained highlighted a strong logarithmic correlation between PCM thickness and energy reduction in all the climatic zones, with higher benefits in office buildings and in warmer climates for both strategies. © 2021 by the authors.

The restriction of carbon dioxide emissions will limit fossil-fuel-fired electricity and affect water consumption in energy-related industries. In this study, a chance-constrained urban agglomeration energy model is developed to plan a cooperative energy-water nexus system with carbon dioxide emission constraints at the regional scale. The model can not only reflect uncertainties expressed as random variables and interval values but also manage energy-water nexus systems under cooperation mechanism effectively. The model is applied to the Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Dongguan region, wherein two scenarios with/without cooperative carbon dioxide emission strategies under different water resource risks are analyzed. Results reveal that the system cost of the study region would decrease under the cooperative carbon dioxide emission strategy. Compared with the case without mitigation cooperation, the cost of those with cooperation would reduce by [4.3, 4.8] % (with 6.2% more carbon dioxide emission) in Shenzhen. The results also demonstrate that water consumption would increase as constraint-violation level decreases from 0.2 to 0. The developed model is efficient for facilitating regional dynamic analyses of carbon dioxide emission mitigation and the associated economic cost under different policy scenarios and system risks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Chance-constrained programming; Cooperative management; Emission mitigation; Energy-water nexus; Regional energy system; Uncertainty","Agglomeration; Cost benefit analysis; Fossil fuels; Global warming; Risk perception; Water resources; Carbon dioxide emissions; Carbon emission managements; Chance-constrained; Constraint violation; Cooperation mechanism; Cooperative energies; Regional dynamics; Urban agglomerations; Carbon dioxide; agglomeration; carbon dioxide; carbon emission; climate change; model; spatiotemporal analysis; strategic approach; China; Guangdong",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100899987

Based on the sum of dynamic carbon abatement costs in each province, the carbon abatement task allocation is optimized, and the data before and after optimization is compared and analyzed. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) The function of carbon abatement efficiency can be estimated using the marginal cost of carbon abatement, by which, the carbon abatement cost of each province can be calculated. (2) The correlation between carbon emissions and carbon abatement efficiency of each province is weak, so the overall carbon abatement efficiency of China is low. (3) Optimizing the allocation of provincial carbon abatement tasks can significantly reduce the total carbon abatement cost and improve the carbon abatement efficiency.

Widely considered to be an effective approach to restore degraded grasslands, grazing exclosure (GE) likely affects biomass allocation and root morphology in the long-term, although their impacts are yet to be documented. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of grazing exclosure durations of 5, 22, and 39 years (GE5, GE22, GE39, respectively) on root:shoot biomass allocation (R:S ratio) and root morphology — including root average diameter (RAD), root density (RD), specific root length (SRL), specific root area (SRA), and root length density (RLD) — in an alpine grassland on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau. Seasonal grazing (SG) land served as a control. In the 0−0.30 m soil layer, the R:S ratios of the SG (1.27) and GE5 sites (0.90) were significantly lower than that of the GE39 site (2.14). However, there was no difference between the GE22 (1.83) and GE39 sites. The R:S ratio of the 0−0.15 m soil layer showed an increasing trend with duration of grazing exclosure and had a significantly greater value under GE39 (1.89) than under GE5 (0.76). However, the R:S ratios for the 0.15−0.30 m soil layer (0.14, 0.28 and 0.25 for GE5, GE22, and GE39, respectively) showed no significant changes with grazing exclosure duration. In the 0−0.30 m soil layer across sampled sites, RAD remained constant, RD and RLD exhibited an increasing trend, while SRA and SRL displayed a slightly decreasing trend with grazing exclosure duration. Below-ground biomass (BGB) was most strongly related to RLD across all sites; to RD and RLD at the GE5 and GE22 sites, and to RAD and RLD at the GE39 site. Both R:S ratio and root morphology were mainly influenced by soil nitrate nitrogen. Although long-term grazing exclosure enhanced BGB and R:S ratio, soil nutrients declined with increasing exclosure duration. Therefore, to achieve improved ecosystem functions, grazing exclosure should be used with caution in this area or other similar regions around the world. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Alpine grassland; Biomass allocation; Grazing exclosure; Root length density; Specific root length","Biodiversity; Biomass; Climate change; Ecosystems; Morphology; Plants (botany); Biodiversity loss; Biomass allocation; Ecosystem functions; Effective approaches; Grazing exclosures; Qinghai-Tibetan plateau; Root length density; Specific root length; Soils; biodiversity; biomass; biomass allocation; climate change; ecosystem function; grassland; morphology; root system; root-shoot ratio; soil nutrient; China; Qinghai-Xizang Plateau",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101777571

In that context, small hydropower plants represent an attractive solution for distributed electricity generation. Reverse-running centrifugal pumps (also known as ""pump-As-Turbines,"" PaT) are increasingly selected in that field. Amongst the existing type of pumps, drag-Type regenerative pumps (RP) can perform similarly to radial centrifugal pumps in terms of head and efficiency for low specific speed values. For a fixed rotational speed, RPs with linear blades work as pumps or turbines only depending on the flow rate. Such peculiarity makes it particularly intriguing to evaluate RPs working characteristics in the turbine operating mode. In this paper, the performance of three regenerative pump-As-Turbines (RPaT) is analyzed using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The numerical approach is validated using experimental data for both an RP (in the pump working region) and a regenerative turbine (RT) (in the turbine working region). Finally, the numerical simulation of a small-scale RP allows for characterizing both the pump and the turbine regions. Results show that for an RPaT it is possible to find a ""switch region"" where the machine turns from behaving as a pump to behaving as a turbine, the losses not being overcome by the turbine power output. The analysis of the RPaT also shows the inversion of the flow pattern and the constant positioning of the pivot around which the flow creates the typical helical structure that characterizes RPs. © 2021 American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME).

We need to better understand how the dynamics of early species invasions develop and how these result in impacts on the invaded ecosystems. Here we studied the distribution and severe defoliation processes of the box tree moth (Cydalima perspectalis W.), a tree defoliator insect native to Asia and invasive in Europe since 2007, through the combination of species distribution models based on climate and landscape composition information. The results showed that the combination of data from the native and the invaded areas was the most effective methodology for the appropriate invasive species modeling. The species was not influenced by overall landscape factors, but only by the presence of its host plant, dispersal capacity, and climate suitability. Such climate suitability was described by low precipitation seasonality and minimum annual temperatures around 0°C, defining a continentality effect throughout the territory. We emphasize the need of studying distribution and severe defoliation processes separately because we identified that climate suitability was slightly involved in limiting species spread processes but strongly constrained ecosystem impact in terms of defoliation before the species reaches equilibrium with the new environment. New studies on habitat recovery after disturbance, ecological consequences of such impact, and community dynamics in a context of climate change are required for a better understanding of this invasive species. © 2021 The Authors.

Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone (O3) above the US EPA standards is associated with AD risk. Mexico City children experienced pre-and postnatal high exposures to PM2.5, O3, combustion-derived iron-rich nanoparticles, metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and endotoxins. Exposures are associated with early brain gene imbalance in oxidative stress, inflammation, innate and adaptive immune responses, along with epigenetic changes, accumulation of misfolded proteins, cognitive deficits, and brain structural and metabolic changes. The Apolipoprotein E (APOE) 4 allele, the most prevalent genetic risk for AD, plays a key role in the response to air pollution in young girls. APOE 4 heterozygous females with &gt;75% to &lt;94% BMI percentiles are at the highest risk of severe cognitive deficits (1.5-2 SD from average IQ). This review focused on the relationships between gender, BMI, systemic and neural inflammation, insulin resistance, hyperleptinemia, dyslipidemia, vascular risk factors, and central nervous system involvement in APOE4 urbanites exposed to PM2.5 and magnetite combustion-derived iron-rich nanoparticles that can reach the brain.

To find its changes on the impact of urban thermal environment, we applied Pearson correlation analysis and OLS linear regression model from the perspective of urban land use and the local climate zone (LCZ) scheme, and selected Wuhan City in China as a case study. The results showed that the population size decreased in most urban land use and LCZ classes due to the Spring Festival and epidemic effects, which caused residents to leave Wuhan City. As a result, the normalized surface urban heat island changes (SUHInc) decreased by 9.41% at the city level, and a larger SUHInc occurred in commercial and industrial land. Among the LCZ classes, the built-up classes also tended to have a larger SUHInc than the natural land cover classes. However, the population size and human outdoor activity changes did not modify the spatial distribution of the urban thermal environment, because the same trends were observed for various urban land use and LCZ classes, which illustrated that the contribution of anthropogenic heat discharge on the urban thermal environment is relatively weaker. The above findings imply that it is necessary to apply different methods for various urban land uses and alleviate urban heat island. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Anthropogenic heat; COVID-19; Human activity; LCZ; Thermal environment; Urban land use","Atmospheric temperature; Climate models; Correlation methods; Land use; Population distribution; Population statistics; Regression analysis; Anthropogenic heat discharge; Linear regression models; Outdoor activities; Pearson correlation analysis; Spatial-temporal distribution; Surface urban heat islands; Urban heat island; Urban thermal environment; Landforms; anthropogenic effect; comparative study; correlation; COVID-19; heat island; human activity; numerical model; population outbreak; urban climate; urban population; China; Hubei; Wuhan",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101496453

To investigate the thermal interaction among the DBHE, a comprehensive numerical model has been built with the OpenGeoSys software, and it is validated by monitoring data from a pilot project in Xi'an, China. The long-term simulations manifest that the outlet temperature of the DBHE array has a noticeable draw-down of 4.70°C over 20 years in comparison to the single borehole setup. The maximum difference of outlet temperature among individual DBHE can reach up to 0.88°C over 20 years, which will lead to a shifted thermal load of 23.35kW (12.25% of the designed average value). Based on the predicted subsurface temperature distribution, a non-linear correlation can be established between the drawdown in working fluid temperature and the accumulated amount of extracted heat.

This study realized in collaboration with five remote and Indigenous communities across Canada investigates the main barriers and potential solutions to developing stable and sustainable wood-based bioenergy systems. Our results highlight that despite the differences in available biomass and geographical context, these communities face common policy, economic, operational, cultural, social, and environmental risks and barriers to developing bioenergy. The communities identified and ranked the biggest barriers as follows; the high initial investment of bioenergy projects, the logistical and operational challenges of developing a sustainable wood supply chain in remote locations, and the limited opportunities for community leadership of bioenergy projects. Environmental risks have been ranked as the least important by all the communities, except for the communities in Manitoba, which ranked it as the second most important risk. However, all the communities agreed that climate change is the main environmental driver disturbing the wood-based bioenergy supply chain. To de-risk the wood-based bioenergy system, we suggest that stable and sustainable supply chains can be implemented by restoring community-based resources management supported by local knowledge and workforce. Using local knowledge can also help reduce the impacts caused by biomass harvesting on the ecosystem and avoid competition with traditional land uses. Including positive externalities to cost benefit analysis, when comparing bioenergy systems to existing energy installation, will likely make bioenergy projects more attractive for the community financially. Alternatively, supporting co-learning between partners and among communities can improve knowledge and innovation sharing. © 2021 by the authors.

Chan School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States","In the last decade, the transition away from coal and to fossil gas and biomass in the U.S. has had a major influence on greenhouse gas emissions, especially from electricity generation. However, the effect of this transition on the public health burden of air pollution is not well understood. We use three reduced complexity models (RCMs) and emissions inventory data to reconstruct the changes in health impacts due to PM2.5 exposure from stationary fuel combustion sources in the U.S., from 2008 to 2017. In 2008, the health impacts of air pollution from stationary sources was largely driven by coal combustion. By 2017, the contribution of coal has dropped precipitously, and the health burden of stationary air pollution sources is shared among a mixture of source types and fuels - largely gas and biomass in buildings and industry, and the remaining coal-fired electricity generation. Nationwide, in 2017, health impacts of biomass and wood combustion are higher than combustion of coal and gas individually. Industrial boilers had the highest emissions and health impacts, followed by residential buildings, electricity, and then commercial buildings. All three RCMs indicate that biomass and wood are the leading sources of stationary source air pollution health impacts in 24 states, and that the total health impacts of gas surpass that of coal in 19 states and the District of Columbia. We develop a projection method using state-level energy consumption data for 2018 and show that these trends likely continued. The RCMs had high agreement for 2008 emissions, when sulfur dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants were the predominant air pollution source. However there was substantial disagreement between the three RCMs on the 2017 health burden, likely due to pollutants less well-characterized by the RCMs having a higher proportionate share of total impacts. © 2021 The Author(s).

Absorption is typically accomplished in an aqueous solvent mixture. The solvent mixture is vastly dependent on the application range; it might contain chemical solvents (amines), activators, and physical solvents. In this work, the vapor−liquid equilibria for absorption of the sour gases CO2 and H2S was investigated in systems containing the chemical solvent methyl diethanolamine (MDEA) and the physical solvents tetrahydrothiophene-1,1-dioxide (sulfolane) or the ionic liquid 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium acetate. The solubilities of CO2 and H2S were predicted and validated using experimental literature data in a broad range of temperature (313−373 K), sour-gas loading (up to 2 moles gas per moles of MDEA), and pressure (up to 180 bar) at constant MDEA weight fraction (20.9 wt %) and sulfolane weight fraction (30.5 wt %). The equation-of-state electrolyte perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (ePC-SAFT) was utilized in this work for the predictions combined with the Born term to physically correctly describe the Gibbs energy of solvation of ions in the aqueous mixture of chemical and physical solvents; this was introduced in a recent work [Bülow, M. et al. Fluid Phase Equilib. 2021, 535, 112967]. Using this approach allowed reducing the total number of binary interaction parameters in these systems of maximum 11 species to a minimum; these parameters were fitted exclusively to data of binary mixtures. The ePC-SAFT predictions of the gas solubility were most accurate at low sour-gas loadings and high temperatures. This work provides a thermodynamic framework for the solvent selection for sour-gas absorption in a broad range of conditions. This enables a realistic decrease in experimental effort for solvent selection in sour-gas absorption. © 2021 American Chemical Society",,"Amines; Binary mixtures; Carbon dioxide; Electrolytes; Equations of state; Forecasting; Hydrogen sulfide; Ionic liquids; Natural gasoline plants; Solubility; Solvents; Sour gas; Binary interaction parameter; Energy of solvation; Methyldiethanolamine; Natural gas processing plants; Perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theories; Solvent selection; Tetrahydrothiophene; Thermodynamic framework; Gas absorption",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106432992

Given the state's interest in mitigating climate change and growing public attention on grazing systems that enhance carbon sequestration, we investigate the impact of grazing management on soil carbon cycling on California annual rangelands, drawing on soil science, rangeland management, and policy analysis literature. We conclude that using managed grazing for augmenting soil organic carbon on California annual rangelands presents significant challenges. Challenges include the heterogeneity, biogeochemical characteristics, and nonequilibrium nature of California's Mediterranean region, where ecological site conditions, soil type and texture, and climate moderate carbon sequestration. Enduring unknowns in the science underlying soil carbon and the dearth of relevant California-based studies further obscure the potential climate change mitigation effects of grazing systems. Given this, grazing management on California annual rangelands should not be prioritized as a climate change mitigation strategy, unless it is for the purposes of data collection and research. Alternative climate change mitigation opportunities on these landscapes include preventing rangeland conversion and enhancing soil carbon stocks through the suite of range management practices known to augment soil organic carbon or prevent erosion, including marginal cropland restoration, riparian restoration, organic amendments, and silvopasture. In this review, we argue that single-purpose management is generally not fitting for the diverse portfolio of social-ecological services produced on California's vast and varied rangelands. When assessing the value of grazing systems for augmenting soil organic carbon, policymakers, landowners, and other decision makers should consider the potential impacts on the numerous ecosystem services supported by the landscape. The multidisciplinary method presented in this review provides a critical framework for evaluating the appropriateness of working lands carbon policies as Natural Climate Solutions for climate change mitigation are developed in California and other geographies. © 2021 The Society for Range Management","Carbon sequestration; ecosystem services; grasslands; grazing management; land use change; soil carbon","carbon cycle; carbon sequestration; ecosystem management; ecosystem service; grazing management; herb; livestock farming; pasture; rangeland; silviculture; soil organic matter; California; United States; Matthiola",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101353878

Since this demand is driven by climate concerns and an objective to lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the electricity sector, it is crucial to understand the full carbon consequences of wood pellet sourcing, processing, and utilization. We performed a comparative carbon life cycle assessment (LCA) for pellets sourced from three mills in the southern US destined for electricity generation in the UK. The baseline assumptions included GHG emissions of the UK’s 2018 and 2025 target electricity grid mix and feedstock supplied primarily from non-industrial private forest (NIPF) pine plantations augmented with a fraction of sawmill residues. Based on regional expert input, we concluded that forest management practices on the NIPF pine plantations would include timely thinning harvest treatments in the presence of pellet demand. The LCA analysis included landscape carbon stock changes based on USDA Forest Service Forest Vegetation Simulator using current USDA Forest Service Forest Inventory and Analysis data as the starting condition of supply areas in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. We found that GHG emission parity (i.e., the time when accumulated carbon GHG emissions for the bioenergy scenario equal the baseline scenario) is more than 40 years for pellets produced at each individual pellet mill and for all three pellet mills combined when compared to either the UK’s 2018 electricity grid mix or the UK’s targeted electricity grid mix in 2025. The urgency to mitigate climate change with near-term actions as well as increasing uncertainty with longer-term simulations dictated a focus on the next four decades in the analysis. Even at 50% sawmill residues, GHG emission parity was not reached during the 40 years modeled. Results are most likely conservative since we assume a high share of sawmill residues (ranging from 20 to 50%) and did not include limited hardwood feedstocks as reported in the supply chain which are generally associated with delayed GHG emission parity because of lower growth rates. © Copyright © 2021 Buchholz, Gunn and Sharma.","bioenergy; carbon life cycle assessment; climate change; forests; greenhouse gas emissions; pellets",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106197206

Dementia risk factors are significantly different among countries. The number of new cases of dementia anticipated each year worldwide is almost 7.7 million, one new case every four seconds. There are 3.6 million (46%) new cases per year in Asia, 2.3 million (31%) in Europe, 1.2 million (16%) in the Americas, and 0.5 million (7%) in Africa. Latin American and Caribbean low and middle-income countries are at high risk. Air pollution is an important risk modifiable factor for dementia across the world, and the recent report of the Alzheimer's disease continuum in children and young adults residing in Metropolitan Mexico City along with the presence of cognitive impairment in 55% of the young adult population residing in Mexican cities with fine particulate matter concentrations above the current USEPA annual standard of 12μg/m3 makes this a severe public health problem in progress. It is imperative to keep generating epidemiological data on dementia worldwide and their relationship with air pollutants to improve the strategies to face all the challenges associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease in particular.

In this context, the air quality changes in the highly populated and trafficked Brazilian states of São Paulo (SP) and Rio de Janeiro (RJ) were addressed using a combination of satellite and ground-based daily data analysis. We explored nitrogen dioxide (NO2) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) daily levels for the month of May from 2015-2020. Daily measurements of NO2 column concentrations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) aboard NASA’s Aura satellite were analyzed and decreases of 42% and 49.6% were found for SP and RJ, respectively, during the year 2020 compared to the 2015-2019 average. Besides NO2 column retrievals, ground-based data measured by the Brazilian States Environmental Institutions were analyzed and correlated with satellite retrievals. Correlation coefficients between year-to-year changes in satellite column and ground-based concentrations were 77% and 53% in SP and RJ, respectively. Ground-based data showed 13.3% and 18.8% decrease in NO2 levels for SP and RJ, respectively, in 2020 compared to 2019. In SP, no significant change in PM2.5 was observed in 2020 compared to 2019. To further isolate the effect of emissions reduction due to the lockdown, meteorological data and number of wildfire hotspots were analyzed. NO2 concentrations showed negative and positive correlations with wind speed and temperature, respectively. PM2.5 concentration distributions suggested an influence by the wildfires in the southeast region of the country. Synergistic analyses of satellite retrievals, surface level concentrations, and weather data provide a more complete picture of changes to pollutant levels. © 2021 by the authors.

We consider simulations where dust is either prescribed from an IPSL PI simulation or from CESM simulations (Albani et al., 2015). In addition, we also consider an extreme mid-Holocene case where dust is suppressed. We focus on the estimation of the dust radiative effects and the relative responses of the African and Indian monsoon, showing how local dust forcing or orography affect atmospheric temperature profiles, humidity and precipitation. The simulated mid-Holocene climate is statistically different in many regions compared to previous mid-Holocene simulations with the IPSL models. However, it translates to only minor improvements compared to palaeoclimate reconstructions, and the effect of dust has little impact on mid-Holocene model skill over large regions. Our analyses confirm the peculiar role of dust radiative effect over bright surfaces such as African deserts compared to other regions, brought about by the change of sign of the dust radiative effect at the top of atmosphere for high surface albedo. We also highlight a strong dependence of results on the dust pattern. In particular, the relative dust forcing between West Africa and the Middle East impacts the relative climate response between India and Africa and between Africa, the western tropical Atlantic and the Atlantic meridional circulation. It also affects the feedback on the Atlantic Ocean thermohaline circulation. Dust patterns should thus be better constrained to fully understand the changes in the dust cycle and forcing during the mid-Holocene, which also informs on the potential changes in key dust feedbacks in the future. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Application of lime (L) and phosphogypsum (PG) can overcome these constraints and improve soil quality, but the long-term effects of these amendments on both abiotic and biotic soil properties are not known, particularly when applied in combination. Here, we evaluated the effects of L (acidity corrective), PG (soil conditioner), and their combination (LPG) on soil organic matter (SOM) transformations, soil chemical and physical properties, and microbiome assembly in a long-term experiment under a no-till crop rotation system in a tropical soil. The Ca-based soil amendments increased C concentrations (labile and stable fractions), improved soil physicochemical properties, and changed the associations between several bacterial and fungal groups. Contrary to expectations, the acidic soil amended with PG exhibited greater number of significant shifts in the bacterial community than soil amended with L or LPG, as well as higher soil bulk density. By contrast, the fungal community underwent greater shifts in soil amended with L or LPG, which had higher macroporosity. L and LPG amendment shaped the fungal community and rearranged the SOM fractions at similar rates, suggesting an essential role of the altered fungi in SOM transformation. In addition, combining L with PG increased the relevance of many low-abundance microorganisms, especially fungi, compared with the control, indicating an increase in their ecological role in the soil. Finally, by applying general joint attribute modeling and sensitivity analysis, we determined that soil fertility increased most in LPG-amended soil, as the ensuing changes in the bacterial and fungal communities resulted in improved SOM fractions, soil physical characteristics and, ultimately, soil quality. © 2021 The Author(s)","Bacterial community; Fungal community; Long-term field experiment; No-till system; pH; Soil organic matter transformation; Tropical soil","Bacteria; Biogeochemistry; Crops; Fertilizers; Fungi; Lime; Organic carbon; pH; Physicochemical properties; Sensitivity analysis; Soils; Bacterial community; Fungal community; Long-term field experiments; Microbiome; No-till system; Phosphogypsum; Soil amendment; Soil organic matter transformation; Soil organic matters; Tropical soils; Tropics; agricultural management; aluminum; bacterium; calcium; crop rotation; environmental factor; fungus; gypsum; lime; management practice; microbial community; physicochemical property; porosity; soil amendment; soil degradation; soil microorganism; soil organic matter; Bacteria (microorganisms)",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102049436

A total of 45 sites in the Mid-Atlantic were sampled between 2016 and 2019 using a scallop dredge, and a subset of the whelk collected were aged (n = 318). Lab-reared individuals and back-calculation methods were used to fill missing juvenile observations. The Mid-Atlantic Bight population appears to differ in the fit of growth curves, compared to other assessed populations, due to a timing difference in hatching. Growth curves for whelk from the Mid-Atlantic Bight show that maturity is reached between 4 and 6 years of age. A statolith chronology spanning a 10-year period was developed using a mixed-effects modeling approach. The chronology was used to explore the influence of temperature variation on growth during ecologically relevant periods. Growth increased with higher annual temperatures however specific seasonal bottom temperature had varying effects on growth. Increasing bottom temperature during summer, the anticipated egg-development and hatching period in this region, resulted in an age-dependent decline in growth with a positive effect on younger whelk and a negative effect on older whelk growth. Higher summer temperatures provide larger time-windows for growth, facilitating increased growth in early life stages. It appears that whelk in this region possess sufficient growth plasticity to adapt to warmer conditions throughout the year, but increased warming during specific seasons may depress growth in older individuals, potentially affecting fitness and population persistence. Understanding these temperature-growth dynamics are critical for disentangling the effects of climate change on whelk growth, allowing for population predictions in the future. © 2021 The Authors","Buccinum undatum; Growth; Mixed effects modeling; Statolith; Temperature","chronology; climate change; ecological modeling; fitness; gastropod; growth; hatching; juvenile; statolith; temperature effect; Atlantic Ocean; Middle Atlantic Bight; Buccinum undatum",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101545265

This study analyses taxonomic and functional richness in European grasslands along continental-scale temperature and precipitation gradients. Location: Europe. Methods: We quantified functional and taxonomic richness of 55,748 vegetation plots. Six plant traits, related to resource acquisition and conservation, were analysed to describe plant community functional composition. Using a null-model approach we derived functional richness effect sizes that indicate higher or lower diversity than expected given the taxonomic richness. We assessed the variation in absolute functional and taxonomic richness and in functional richness effect sizes along gradients of minimum temperature, temperature range, annual precipitation, and precipitation seasonality using a multiple general additive modelling approach. Results: Functional and taxonomic richness was high at intermediate minimum temperatures and wide temperature ranges. Functional and taxonomic richness was low in correspondence with low minimum temperatures or narrow temperature ranges. Functional richness increased and taxonomic richness decreased at higher minimum temperatures and wide annual temperature ranges. Both functional and taxonomic richness decreased with increasing precipitation seasonality and showed a small increase at intermediate annual precipitation. Overall, effect sizes of functional richness were small. However, effect sizes indicated trait divergence at extremely low minimum temperatures and at low annual precipitation with extreme precipitation seasonality. Conclusions: Functional and taxonomic richness of European grassland communities vary considerably over temperature and precipitation gradients. Overall, they follow similar patterns over the climate gradients, except at high minimum temperatures and wide temperature ranges, where functional richness increases and taxonomic richness decreases. This contrasting pattern may trigger new ideas for studies that target specific hypotheses focused on community assembly processes. And though effect sizes were small, they indicate that it may be important to consider climate seasonality in plant diversity studies. © 2021 The Authors.","Environmental filtering; Favourability hypothesis; Functional richness; Grassland diversity; Limiting similarity; Null model; Plant trait diversity; Precipitation gradient; Seasonality; Taxonomic richness; Temperature gradient; Trait-environment relationship","air temperature; community structure; functional role; grassland; plant community; precipitation (climatology); seasonality; species diversity; species richness; taxonomy",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105495368

The feasibility of intermediate heat carriers number is also analysed for better plants interconnection considering the optimal amount of the recovered heat. The presented case studies illustrate the pathway selection of site recovery system synthesis with a certain number of heat exchangers, heat transfer area, intermediate utilities, and interconnection between production processes, heat consumers, heat generation facilities and other members of an integrated regional network. Case studies demonstrate that the use of two proposed approaches allows minimising unit numbers and heat transfer area. The first one provides 18% less heat transfer area and the second one suggest network with 41% less unit. The economic results are compared and discussed. The results of this work can be used for site recovery network development as well as a decision-making tool during interplant heat integration and improvement of side-wide heat recovery.

In order to reduce the adverse impacts of farming activities on the environment, farmers need to get accurate insights on emissions from their activities so that they can take appropriate corrective actions to reduce their emissions. Insights on carbon emissions can be obtained by using carbon footprint calculators, which proliferated during the past few years. However, even though these tools are freely available online, limited work has been undertaken to analyse and compare their applications. Taking cognizance of this gap, this paper analyses key aspects of existing farming-based carbon calculators, notably their scope, calculation method employed, and consistency of results provided. Following application and analysis of three calculators, results showed varied categorisation of calculation parameters, granularity of inputs, lack of transparency and some inconsistent results.

This fungus has a symptomless endophytic life stage. Disease symptoms become visible when trees have been weakened by abiotic stress, usually related to warmer temperatures and drought. Currently, this disease is observed regularly in Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) sites in parts of Europe, such as Germany, increasing dramatically in the last decade. Changes in climatic conditions will gradually increase the damage caused by this fungus, because it is favored by elevated temperature. Thus, host trees with reduced vitality due to climate change-related environmental stress are expected to be more susceptible to an outbreak of Diplodia Tip Blight disease. There is currently no established and effective method to control S. sapinea. This project aims to reveal the nature of the endophyte community of Scots pine. Utilizing the antagonistic core community of endophytes could serve as a novel tool for disease control. Results from this study provide a starting point for new solutions to improve forest health and counter S. sapinea disease outbreaks. We screened potential antagonistic endophytes against S. sapinea and infected Scots pine seedlings with the most common endophytes and S. sapinea alone and combination. The host was stressed by limiting access to water. The antagonism study revealed 13 possible fungi with the ability to inhibit the growth of S. sapinea in vitro, for example Sydowia polyspora. None of the tested co-infected fungi (Desmazierella acicola, Didymellaceae sp., Microsphaeropsis olivacea, Sydowia polyspora, and Truncatella conorum-piceae) showed strong necrosis development in vivo, even when host stress increased due to drought. However, the infection experiment demonstrated that drought conditions enhance the effect of the disease outbreak, triggering S. sapinea to cause more necrosis in the infected twigs. © Copyright © 2021 Blumenstein, Bußkamp, Langer, Schlößer, Parra Rojas and Terhonen.","antagonism; climate change; Diplodia tip blight; drought; infection; Sphaeropsis sapinea; Sydowia polyspora",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107450244

The need for high-quality meteorological forecasts for managing risk across all timescales has therefore never been greater. This paper seeks to extend the uptake of meteorological data in the power systems modelling community to include probabilistic meteorological forecasts at sub-seasonal lead times. Such forecasts are growing in skill and are receiving considerable attention in power system risk management and energy trading. Despite this interest, these forecasts are rarely evaluated in power system terms, and technical barriers frequently prohibit use by non-meteorological specialists. This paper therefore presents data produced through a new EU climate services programme Subseasonal-to-seasonal forecasting for Energy (S2S4E). The data correspond to a suite of well-documented, easy-to-use, self-consistent daily and nationally aggregated time series for wind power, solar power and electricity demand across 28 European countries. The data are accessible from <a hrefCombining double low line""https://doi.org/10.17864/1947.275""https://doi.org/10.17864/1947.275 <span classCombining double low line""cit""idCombining double low line""xref_paren.1""(<a hrefCombining double low line""#bib1.bibx26""Gonzalez et al., <a hrefCombining double low line""#bib1.bibx26""2020)</span. The data include a set of daily ensemble reforecasts from two leading forecast systems spanning 20 years (ECMWF, an 11-member ensemble, with twice-weekly starts for 1996-2016, totalling 22 880 forecasts) and 11 years (NCEP, a 12-member lagged-ensemble, constructed to match the start dates from the ECMWF forecast from 1999-2010, totalling 14 976 forecasts). The reforecasts contain multiple plausible realisations of daily weather and power data for up to 6 weeks in the future. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time a fully calibrated and post-processed daily power system forecast set has been published, and this is the primary purpose of this paper. A brief review of forecast skill in each of the individual primary power system properties and a composite property is presented, focusing on the winter season. The forecast systems contain additional skill over climatological expectation for weekly-average forecasts at extended lead times, though this skill depends on the nature of the forecast metric considered. This highlights the need for greater collaboration between the energy and meteorological research communities to develop applications, and it is hoped that publishing these data and tools will support this. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

The concept of a Green Wave, i.e., the coordinated switching of traffic lights in order to favor a single direction and reduce congestion, is often discussed as a simple mechanism to avoid breaking and accelerating, thereby reducing fuel consumption. On the other hand, making car use more attractive might also increase emissions. In this study, we use an agent-based model to investigate the benefit of a Green Wave in order to find out whether it can outweigh the effects of increased car use.

Organic-rich sapropel layers deposited in the Mediterranean Sea provide a natural laboratory to study the processes that have controlled changes in seawater oxygen levels in the recent geological past. Our study is based on three sediment cores spanning the last 10 000 years and located on a bathymetric transect offshore from the western distributaries of the Nile delta. These cores are partly to continuously laminated in the sections recording sapropel S1, which is indicative of bottom-water anoxia above the western Nile deep-sea fan. We used a combination of microfacies analyses and inorganic and organic geochemical measurements to reconstruct changes in oxygenation conditions at seasonal to millennial timescales. Millimetre-Thick laminations are composed of detrital, biogenic and chemogenic sublayers reflecting seasonal successions of sedimentation. Dark layers reflect the deposition of summer floods and two types of light layers correspond to autumn plankton blooms and authigenic carbonates formed in the water column during spring early summer, respectively. The isotopic signature of the authigenic carbonates suggests permanent anoxic to euxinic bottom waters resulting in high levels of anaerobic remineralization of organic matter and highlights their potential to reconstruct seawater chemistry at times when benthic fauna was absent. Ratios of major elements combined with biomarkers of terrestrial and marine organic matter and redox-sensitive compounds allow changes in terrigenous input, primary productivity and past deoxygenation dynamics on millennial timescales to be tracked. Rapid fluctuations of oxygenation conditions in the upper 700m water depth occurred above the Nile deep-sea fan between 10 and 6.5 ka BP, while deeper cores recorded more stable anoxic conditions. Synchronous changes in terrigenous input, primary productivity and past oxygenation dynamics after 6.5 ka BP show that runoff-driven eutrophication played a central role in rapid oxygenation changes in the south-eastern Levantine Basin. These findings are further supported by other regional records and reveal time-Transgressive changes in oxygenation state driven by rapid changes in primary productivity during a period of long-Term deep-water stagnation. © 2021 Copernicus GmbH.

Rancière's political thought provides a way to consider the limits of consensus on what should count, the subjectivity in how we count, who is able to make things count, and how particular regimes of counting are sustained and disrupted. Empirically, this paper considers the City of Manchester's carbon accounts and targets at the time of their 2010 Stakeholder Conference and an activist attempt to declare Manchester Airport as the ‘elephant in the room’. It draws upon interviews with policymakers, activists, experts and accountants working in Manchester. Mobilising Rancière's notion of postdemocracy, I demonstrate how the consensus around standardisation is used to depoliticise disagreements on what emissions should ‘count’ and conclude by offering reflection on how repoliticisation might occur. © 2021","Accounting; Carbon; Politics; Post-Politics; Rancière; Standards","carbon emission; climate change; democracy; environmental policy; environmental politics; standardization; England; Manchester [England]; United Kingdom; elephant; Elephantidae",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101622968

In Ethiopia, the upper Awash sub-basin supports expanding urban and industrial areas, with increasing water demands. Studies have preferentially focused either on surface water hydrology or on groundwater characterization. However, novel tools are required to support the conjunctive use of surface and groundwater for competing users under potential climate change impacts. In this paper, we present research based on a WEAP-MODFLOW link configured for four catchments in the upper Awash sub-basin (Akaki, Melka Kunture, Mojo, and Koka). The Akaki catchment supplies water for Addis Ababa city. Unlike most surface water hydrological models, both supply (surface water and groundwater) and demand (domestic, industrial, and livestock) are modeled. The tool was used to evaluate the impacts of population growth, leakage, expansion of surface and groundwater supply schemes, and climate change scenarios up to the year 2030. Considering the high population growth rate scenario for Addis Ababa city, the unmet domestic water demand may increase to 760 MCM in 2030. Water leakage through poor water supply distribution networks contributed about 23% of the unmet water demand. Though not significant compared with population and water loss stresses, climate change also affect the supply demand condition in the basin. Planning for more groundwater abstraction without considering additional surface water reservoir schemes will noticeably impact the groundwater resource, with groundwater levels projected to decline by more than 20 m. Even more groundwater level decline is observed In the Akaki catchment, where Addis Ababa city is located. Conjunctive use of surface and groundwater not only boosts the supply demand situation in the basin but will lift off some of the stresses from the groundwater resources. Even under the likely increase in temperature and low precipitation climate scenarios, the conjunctive use resulted in a significant increase in domestic water demand coverage from 26% for the reference condition to 90% in 2030, with minimum effect on the groundwater resources. To improve water security conditions through sustainable utilization of both surface and groundwater resources, policy responses need to consider surface and groundwater conjunctive use. Minimizing water leakage should also be given the highest priority. © Copyright © 2021 Birhanu, Kebede, Charles, Taye, Atlaw and Birhane.","Awash River basin; conjunctive use; Ethiopia; integrated use; MODFLOW; water security; water supply; WEAP","Agriculture; Catchments; Climate change; Groundwater; Leakage (fluid); Population statistics; Reservoirs (water); Runoff; Surface water resources; Water supply; Climate change impact; Climate change scenarios; Groundwater abstraction; Population growth rates; Supply demand conditions; Surface water and groundwaters; Surface water hydrology; Sustainable utilization; Groundwater resources; catchment; groundwater; human activity; water supply; Awash Basin; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106148005

This case study was conducted as two separate studies as a part of Horizon 2020-funded ECHOES project under Work Package 6, aiming to gain insight into the collective magnitudes of energy-related choices and behavior. The starting point of the process is marked, in 2015, by the municipality becoming a party to the Covenant of Mayors movement, joining around 8,000 signatories from over 50 countries. In line with European Union’s (EU’s) climate targets and associated energy-related policies, signatories of the Covenant of Mayors aim to decrease carbon emissions by 20% by 2020 and by 40% by 2030. In order to enhance the design and operationalization of policies for achieving these targets, each partner in the Covenant of Mayors is required to develop a Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP). The SEAP is to be prepared within 2 years of becoming a party to the Covenant of Mayors and involves action plans and projects in order to operationalize the strategies for achieving the associated targets. To this end, this study analyzes the Metropolitan Municipality’s SEAP and its components, which include zero-emission public transportation project, transformation of existing buildings to a more energy-efficient standard and related energy audit studies, a project for decreasing waiting periods in traffic via a Smart Traffic System, a pedestrianization project, and a project for increasing the use of geothermal energy for district heating. This study set out to identify the internal and external factors, as well as bottom-up and top-down mechanisms involved in various phases of the preparation and implementation of the SEAP. The research method was expert interviews, incorporating viewpoints and perceptions of stakeholders from different levels of the municipality. Among the key results are understanding the roles of enthusiasts and frontrunners in such initiative and the importance of top-management and central government support. © Copyright © 2021 Biresselioglu and Demir.","Covenant of Mayors; energy transition; municipality; sustainable energy action plan; Turkey; İzmir",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107441199

It can reduce carbon emissions and HVAC costs. Low-temperature (&lt;25 °C) aquifer thermal energy storage (LT-ATES) is already widely-deployed in central and northern Europe, and there is renewed interest in high-temperature (&gt;50 °C) aquifer thermal energy storage (HT-ATES). However, it is unclear if LT-ATES guidelines for well spacing, reservoir depth, and transmissivity will apply to HT-ATES. We develop a thermo-hydro-mechanical-economic (THM$) analytical framework to balance three reservoir-engineering and economic constraints for an HT-ATES doublet connected to a district heating network. We find the optimal well spacing and flow rate are defined by the “reservoir constraints” at shallow depth and low permeability and are defined by the “economic constraints” at great depth and high permeability. We find the optimal well spacing is 1.8 times the thermal radius. We find that the levelized cost of heat is minimized at an intermediate depth. The minimum economically-viable transmissivity (MEVT) is the transmissivity below which HT-ATES is sure to be economically unattractive. We find the MEVT is relatively insensitive to depth, reservoir thickness, and faulting regime. Therefore, it can be approximated as 5⋅10−13 m3. The MEVT is useful for HT-ATES pre-assessment and can facilitate global estimates of HT-ATES potential. © 2021 The Authors","Geothermal energy; Heat storage; High-temperature aquifer thermal energy storage; HT-ATES; Levelized cost of heat; Reservoir engineering","Aquifers; District heating; Heat storage; Low permeability reservoirs; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Temperature; Thermal energy; Waste heat; Aquifer thermal energy storage; District heating networks; Economic constraints; Economically viable; Intermediate depths; Reservoir constraints; Reservoir engineering; Reservoir thickness; Well spacing; cost analysis; detection method; energy storage; high temperature; permeability; temperature effect; thermal power; transmissivity; Dimeresia howellii",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101524735

For more than a decade, decision-makers in Fredericton have worked to mainstream adaptation action within municipal policy in order to address the growing flood risk. Through anticipatory spatial planning and incremental infrastructure upgrades, the city aim's to proactively mitigate the impacts of climate change on day-to-day life. Framed through evolutionary governance, this article investigates the relationships between actors and institutions, as well as power and knowledge in order to uncover long-standing path dependencies that hinder comprehensive climate change adaptation action. While Fredericton can be considered a success story in many ways, this research reveals flawed multi-level governance structures and economic development goals as major barriers to effective adaptation in practice.

The formation of ship emissions strongly depends on the dynamically varying travel conditions and it is important to identify the emissions in order to guide the rule-makers to take the necessary measures correctly. In this study, an emission estimation modelling based on dynamic variables, such as voyage duration, engine revolutions per minute, speed, displacement, weather condition, sea conditions and average draught, has been realized by using artificial neural networks (ANN). The difference between the results of ANN and traditional estimation methods was found to be 1.57%. Then, in order to determine the optimum route, the ANN model was implemented for June and January in the Northern and Southern routes of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and it was concluded that harder sea and weather conditions produced more emissions. Finally, fuel consumptions, fuel costs and social costs of the emissions for different routes were calculated. © IMechE 2020.","artificial neural networks; emission estimation; MATLAB; Shipping emissions; weather routing","Meteorology; Neural networks; Ships; Emission estimation; Estimation methods; Operational conditions; Optimum route; Pacific ocean; Revolutions per minutes; Ship emissions; Voyage duration; Gas emissions",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85097600377

The approach is being tested and promoted globally including Nepal. However, there are limited studies on why EbA faces challenges of mainstreaming and wider upscaling in developing countries' policies and practices. Based on an empirical case study from the first EbA pilot project site in Nepal ""Panchase Mountain Ecological Region"", expert consultation, and in-depth policy analysis, this study examines the effectiveness of interventions implemented through EbA and explores “Why” questions related to mainstreaming and upscaling of EbA in Nepal. The results showed that EbA helps to reduce climate vulnerability and enhance socio-ecosystem resilience. However, it often lacks innovativeness in addressing the risk and vulnerability associated with the changing climate. Though EbA is spelled out in most of Nepal's climate change policies, it faces sustainability issues due to low priority, lack of a proper institutional mechanism, and inadequate budget provisions. The EbA related activities are implemented on a small scale, runs for a short period, and failed to demonstrate tangible impacts. The sustainability of the EbA practices in Nepal will be ensured, only if it is mainstreamed in the government's regular planning process, receives enough budget from the government, and has robust institutional mechanisms in place for implementing and monitoring EbA activities. The study's findings are expected to be useful for policymakers, practitioners, and development agencies to shape interventions to institutionalize the EbA approach in the developing countries. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Mainstreaming; Policy; Socio-ecological resilience; Sustainability; Vulnerability","adaptive management; developing world; ecosystem management; environmental policy; policy analysis; policy approach; sustainability; vulnerability; Nepal",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103993215

Recently, consumption-based accounting (CBA) approaches have emerged as alternatives to conventional production-based accounts, quantifying FOLU emissions associated with biomass consumption, for example, of particular territories. However, the quantification and allocation of FOLU emissions to individual biomass products, a fundamental part of CBA approaches, is a complex endeavour. Existing studies make diverging methodological choices, which are rarely critically discussed. In this study, we provide a structured overview of existing CBA approaches to estimating FOLU emissions. We cluster the literature in a two-by-two grid, distinguishing the primary element under investigation (impacts of changing consumption patterns in a region vs. impacts of consumption on production landscapes) and the analytical lens (prospective vs retrospective). Further, we identify three distinct dimensions which characterise the way in which different studies allocate FOLU emissions to biomass products: the choice of reference system and the spatial and temporal scales. Finally, we identify three frontiers that require future attention: (1) overcoming structural biases which underestimate FOLU emissions from territories that experienced deforestation in the distant past, (2) explicitly tackling the interdependence of proximate causes and ultimate drivers of land use change, and (3) assessing uncertainties and understanding the effects of land management. In this way, we enable a critical assessment of appropriate methods, support a nuanced interpretation of results from particular approaches as well as enhance the informative value of CBA approaches related to FOLU emissions. Our analysis contributes to discussions on sustainable land use practices with respect to biomass consumption and has implications for informing international climate policy in scenarios where consumption-based approaches are adopted in practice. © 2021 The Author(s)",,"carbon; assessment method; belowground biomass; biomass; carbon emission; carbon storage; deforestation; environmental policy; forestry; land use; land use change; sustainability; air analysis; biomass; biomass production; carbon cycle; carbon footprint; carbon sequestration; climate; climate change; deforestation; environmental impact; environmental policy; forestry; land use; opportunity cost; Review; biomass; ecosystem; environmental protection; prospective study; retrospective study; Matthiola; Biomass; Carbon; Conservation of Natural Resources; Ecosystem; Prospective Studies; Retrospective Studies",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101881013

We sought to determine if socioeconomic status modifies the risk association between fine particulate matter air pollution (PM2.5) and CV mortality. Methods: We linked county-level age-adjusted CV mortality data from Multiple Cause of Death files (2000-2016, ICD10: I00-I99) with 2015 Social Deprivation Index (SDI), a validated estimate of socioeconomic status, and modelled spatial and temporal mean annual PM2.5 exposures (2012-2018). Higher SDI suggests greater deprivation and lower socioeconomic status. Associations between PM2.5 and age adjusted CV mortality were estimated using linear models. Results: A total of 5,769,315 cardiovascular deaths from 2012-2018 across 3106 United States counties were analyzed. Both PM2.5 (β (SE) 7.584 (0.938), P &lt;.001) and SDI scores (β (SE) 0.591 (0.140), P &lt;.001) were independently associated with age-adjusted CV mortality (R2 = 0.341). The association between PM2.5 and CV mortality were stronger among counties with highest SDI, P value for interaction =.012. Conclusion: Social deprivation and PM2.5 exposures were independently associated with county level age-adjusted CV mortality. The associations between PM2.5 and CV mortality were stronger in counties with high vs low social deprivation. SDI and PM2.5 represent potential targets to reduce CV mortality disparities and interventions to reduce PM2.5 exposure may be most impactful in communities of low socioeconomic status. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.",,"age; ambient air; article; cardiovascular mortality; cause of death; controlled study; human; ICD-10; PM2.5 exposure; social isolation; social status; United States; adult; adverse event; air pollution; cardiovascular disease; clinical trial; cross-sectional study; environmental exposure; epidemiology; female; follow up; male; mortality; multicenter study; particulate matter; retrospective study; survival rate; United States; Adult; Air Pollution; Cardiovascular Diseases; Cross-Sectional Studies; Environmental Exposure; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Male; Particulate Matter; Retrospective Studies; Survival Rate; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102049829

Changes in annual NPP between 2000–2010 and 2070–2080 were projected with the biogeochemical ecosystem model NASA-Carnegie Ames Stanford Approach (CASA). A multi-temporal data set, including 16-day MODIS composites with a spatial resolution of 250 m, was used within the CASA model. The 5th Assessment Report (AR5) of the IPCC presented several scenarios for RCPs named RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, RCP 6.0, and RCP 8.5 that laid the foundation for the future climate projections. The futuristic NPP modelling was based on the assumptions of maintaining CO2 level in the range of 421 to 936 ppm and a rise in temperature from 1.1 to 2.6 °C. The NPP in Turkey averaged 1232 g C m2 year−1 as per the model results. Considering 2000–2010 as the baseline period, the NPP was modelled within the range of 9.6 and 316 g C m2 year−1. Modelled average NPP was 1332.4 g C m2 year−1 per year between 2061 and 2080. The forest productivity was also estimated to be increased up to 113 g C m−2 year−1 under the climate change scenarios. However, there were minor differences in the projected average NPP under the baseline period covering years from 2000 to 2080 from those under RCPs. It appeared that variation in temperature and precipitation as a result of climate change affected the terrestrial NPP. The regional environmental and socio-economic consequences of climate change on diverse landscapes such as Turkey were properly modelled and analysed to understand the spatial variation of climate change impacts on vegetation. Changes in NPP imply that forests in Turkey could be carbon sinks in the future as their current potential that would profile Turkey’s climate mitigation. This is one of the pioneering studies to estimate the future changes of regional NPP in Turkey by integrating various spatial inputs and a biogeochemical model. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Biogeochemical model; Climate change; MODIS; Terrestrial NPP","Biogeochemistry; Ecosystems; Forestry; NASA; Photosynthesis; Phytoplankton; Remote sensing; Biogeochemical ecosystems; Biogeochemical modeling; Biogeochemical modelling; Carnegie-ames-stanford approach (CASA); Climate change scenarios; Future climate projections; Net primary productivity; Socio-economic consequences; Climate change; carbon dioxide; climate change; climate effect; ecosystem modeling; MODIS; net primary production; remote sensing; spatial variation; Article; biogeochemistry; climate change; environmental aspects and related phenomena; environmental economics; environmental impact; environmental temperature; land use; net primary productivity; precipitation; remote sensing; trend study; Turkey (republic); vegetation; China; ecosystem; environmental monitoring; theoretical model; turkey (bird); Turkey; Meleagris gallopavo; China; Climate Change; Ecosystem; Environmental Monitoring; Models, Theoretical; Turkey",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103922498

Most of the countries impose a lockdown system with social distancing measures to arrest the rapid transmission of this virus into the human body. The objective of this study is to examine the status of air quality during and pre-COVID-19 lockdown and to recommend some long-term sustainable environmental management plan. The pollution data like PM10, PM2.5, O3, SO2, NO2 and CO have been obtained from State Pollution Control Board under Govt. of West Bengal. Similarly, various land surface temperature (LST) maps have been prepared using LANDSAT-8 OLI and LANDSAT-7 ETM + images of USGS. The maps of NO2 and aerosol concentration over Indian subcontinent have been taken from ESA and NASA. The digital thematic maps and diagrams have been depicted by Grapher 13 and Arc GIS 10.3 platforms. The result shows that the pollutants like CO, NO2 and SO2 are significantly decreased, while the average level of O3 has been slightly increased in 2020 during the lockdown due to close-down of all industrial and transport activities. Meanwhile, around 17.5% was the mean reduction of PM10 and PM2.5 during lockdown compared with previous years owing to complete stop of vehicles movement, burning of biomass and dust particles from the construction works. This study recommends some air pollution-tolerant plant species (in urban vacant spaces and roof tops) for long-term cohabitation among environment, society and development. © 2020, Springer Nature B.V.","Air quality; COVID-19; Lockdown system; Parameters; Sustainable","aerosol; air quality; ArcGIS; atmospheric pollution; biomass burning; COVID-19; disease transmission; Landsat; livelihood; remediation; socioeconomic status; urban area; virus; India; Kolkata; West Bengal; Coronavirus",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85088660402

Methods: We enrolled 230 women in rural Honduran households using traditional biomass stoves and randomly allocated them to one of two study arms. The Justa stove, the study intervention, was locally-sourced, wood-burning, and included an engineered combustion chamber and chimney. At each of 6 visits over 3 years, we measured 24-hour gravimetric personal and kitchen PM2.5 concentrations. Half of the households received the intervention after Visit 2 and half after Visit 4. We conducted intent-to-treat analyses to evaluate the intervention effect using linear mixed models with log-transformed kitchen or personal PM2.5 (separately) as the dependent variable, adjusting for time. We also compared PM2.5 concentrations to World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. Results: Arms 1 and 2 each had 115 participants with 664 and 632 completed visits, respectively. Median 24-hour average personal PM2.5 exposures were 81 μg/m3 (25th–75th percentile: 50–141 μg/m3) for the traditional stove condition (n=622) and 43 μg/m3 (25th–75th percentile: 27–73 μg/m3) for the Justa stove condition (n=585). Median 24-hour average kitchen concentrations were 178 μg/m3 (25th–75th percentile: 69–440 μg/m3; n=629) and 53 μg/m3 (25th–75th percentile: 29–103 μg/m3; n=578) for the traditional and Justa stove conditions, respectively. The Justa intervention resulted in a 32% reduction in geometric mean personal PM2.5 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 20–43%) and a 56% reduction (95% CI: 46–65%) in geometric mean kitchen PM2.5. During rainy and dry seasons, 53% and 41% of participants with the Justa intervention had 24-hour average personal PM2.5 exposures below the WHO interim target-3 guideline (37.5 μg/m3), respectively. Conclusion: The Justa stove intervention substantially lowered personal and kitchen PM2.5 and may be a provisional solution that is feasible for Latin American communities where cleaner fuels may not be available, affordable, or acceptable for some time.

The expansion of oil palm plantations has also occurred in Latin American countries, such as Brazil. Roughly 400 million hectares in Brazil are suitable for the planting of oil palm, but most of this area is currently covered by forest, mainly by the Amazon Rainforest. Climate change has reduced the extent of land suitable for oil palm cultivation in Brazil since under unfavorable climatic conditions, crop yields are reduced. To reconcile the increase in oil palm production in Brazil with the preservation of forests, modeling has been used as a tool to define the best suitable areas for planting expansion, as well as for the assessment of management techniques that aim to increase the yield. OBJECTIVE: Thus, the object of this study was to implement the oil palm crop sub-model in the ECOSMOS integrated simulator and to evaluate its performance to simulate oil palm energy and carbon balance and the crop yield. METHODS: The carbon allocation scheme for oil palm is quite different from the other crops of ECOSMOS. So, we use the sub-PFT (plant functional type) approach, where each phytomer in the plant evolves simultaneously, but individually. RESULTS AND Conclusions: The results showed that the model was able to simulate net radiation (Rn), latent heat flux (LE), and net ecosystem CO2 exchange (NEE) with good accuracy. In contrast, the sensible heat flux (H) was not well simulated due to the lack of information on the soil's physical-hydric properties. The model simulated accurately the annual yield for plants aged between 12 and 25 years, whereas the yield was overestimated for plants aged outside this range. Also, the model better simulated the yield of genetic varieties with seasonal yield, compared to varieties with more uniform yield over the months. SIGNIFICANCE: The robust and consistent results presented for most of the evaluated processes, especially for energy and carbon fluxes, make the oil palm sub-model described here suitable for improve the oil palm production in Brazil. For future studies, efforts should be directed to consider key factors for oil palm, such as the ratio between male and female inflorescences and the abortion rate of inflorescences, which affect crop yield, for a better understanding of the oil palm growth and production. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agriculture; Amazon; ECOSMOS","agricultural production; biomass allocation; carbon balance; carbon cycle; climate conditions; crop yield; dicotyledon; latent heat flux; management practice; net ecosystem exchange; plantation; Amazonas [Brazil]; Brazil; Elaeis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102525416

However, national monitoring data from the US Environmental Protection Agency for criteria pollutants (PM2.5, ozone, NO2, CO, PM10) provide inconsistent support for that expectation. Specifically, during stay-at-home orders, average PM2.5 levels were slightly higher (~10% of its multi-year interquartile range [IQR]) than expected; average ozone, NO2, CO, and PM10 levels were slightly lower (~30%, ~20%, ~27%, and ~1% of their IQR, respectively) than expected. The timing of peak anomaly, relative to the stay-at-home orders, varied by pollutant (ozone: 2 weeks before; NO2, CO: 3 weeks after; PM10: 2 weeks after); but, by 5–6 weeks after stay-at-home orders, the concentration anomalies appear to have ended. For PM2.5, ozone, CO, and PM10, no US state had lower-than-expected pollution levels for all weeks during stay-at-home-orders; for NO2, only Arizona had lower-than-expected levels for all weeks during stay-at-home orders. Our findings show that the enormous changes from the Covid-19 response have not lowered PM2.5 levels across the US beyond their normal range of variability; for ozone, NO2, CO, and PM10 concentrations were lowered but the reduction was modest and transient. © 2020","Air pollution and Covid-19; Air pollution and stay-at-home orders; COVID-19; Criteria air pollution; Stay-at-home orders","Air quality; Environmental Protection Agency; Nitrogen oxides; Ozone; Arizona; Inter quartile ranges; PM10 concentration; Pm10 levels; Pollution level; US Environmental Protection Agency; Pollution detection; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; ozone; air quality; atmospheric pollution; carbon monoxide; COVID-19; nitrogen dioxide; ozone; particulate matter; pollution monitoring; viral disease; air pollutant; air pollution; Article; concentration (parameter); coronavirus disease 2019; environmental monitoring; human; particulate matter 10; particulate matter 2.5; priority journal; United States; air pollutant; Arizona; particulate matter; United States; Varanidae; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Arizona; COVID-19; Humans; Ozone; Particulate Matter; SARS-CoV-2",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099710171

Southeast Asian countries are among those most heavily affected by climate change. The number and intensity of extreme weather events in the region have been increasing markedly, causing severe social and economic damage. Southeast Asian economies are also exposed to gradual effects of global warming as well as transition risks stemming from policies aimed at mitigating climate change. To empirically examine the effect of climate change on the sovereign risk of Southeast Asian countries, we employ indices for vulnerability and resilience to climate change and estimate country-specific OLS models for six countries and a fixed effects panel using monthly data for the period 2002–2018. Both the country-specific and the panel results show that greater climate vulnerability appears to have a sizable positive effect on sovereign bond yields, while greater resilience to climate change has an offsetting effect, albeit to a lesser extent. A higher cost of debt holds back much-needed investment in public infrastructure and climate adaptation, increases the risk of debt sustainability problems, and diminishes the development prospects of Southeast Asian countries. © 2021 The Authors.

A combined spatial analysis of the stable isotope composition of groundwater, surface water, and precipitation could help to understand groundwater sources and recharge processes. In this study, we collected 297 groundwater and stream water samples across Ethiopia and analyzed them for the oxygen and hydrogen isotope ratios. The isotope data were then interpolated into isoscapes for the entire country using the Cokriging method based on their spatial autocorrelation and covariance with elevation, annual mean precipitation, and temperature. These are the first groundwater and stream isoscapes for Ethiopia. By comparing the spatial isotopic distribution of the two water resources with local precipitation, we showed distinct groundwater recharge patterns in different regions in terms of their water sources, timing, seasonality, and the degree of surface and groundwater interaction. We found that the groundwater recharge was generally biased towards the main rainy season. However, in the relatively dry southeastern Ethiopia, groundwater could receive significant input from infrequent high-intensity rainfalls associated with tropical cyclones, but additional precipitation and groundwater isotope data are needed to further test our hypothesis in this data-poor region. Overall, this study has largely expanded the spatial coverage of water stable isotope data and filled significant data gaps in Ethiopia, which could be used to provide vital information in the arid and semi-arid parts of the country where water resources are critical in climate change adaptation strategies. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","D-excess; Ethiopia; Groundwater; Isoscape; Isotope; Recharge","Climate change; Groundwater resources; Hurricanes; Isotopes; Storms; Surface waters; Water conservation; Water management; Water piping systems; Annual mean precipitation; Climate change adaptation; Groundwater interaction; High intensity rainfall; Isotopic distributions; Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes; Spatial autocorrelations; Sustainable water resources; Recharging (underground waters); climate change; groundwater-surface water interaction; hydrogen isotope; meteoric water; oxygen isotope; precipitation (chemistry); resource management; seasonal variation; spatial variation; streamwater; tropical cyclone; water resource; Ethiopia",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101542987

In this study, in vitro assays showed that SME inhibits glycation, carbonyl groups formation, and reduced-thiol groups depletion in bovine serum albumin incubated either reducing sugars or methylglyoxal. The SME effect in retinas of streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats (STZ) was also studied (n = 10) in the normoglycemic group, STZ, STZ rats treated with SME, and STZ rats treated with aminoguanidine (anti-AGEs reference group) during 12 weeks. The retina was sectioned and immunostained for Nε-carboxymethyl lysine (CML), receptor RAGE, NADPH-Nox4, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), 3-nitrotyrosine (NT), nuclear NF-κB, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), S100B protein, and TUNEL assay. Lipid peroxidation was determined in the whole retina by malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. The results showed that in the diabetic retina, SME reduced the CML-RAGE co-localization, oxidative stress (NOX4, iNOS, NT, MDA), inflammation (NF-κB, VEGF, S100B, GFAP), and apoptosis (p < 0.05). Therefore, SME could attenuate the retinal degeneration by inhibition of CML–RAGE interaction. © 2021 by the authors.

The theme of design to combat climate impacts requires the development of knowledge and process models capable of managing the complexity of the information necessary to direct a climate-proof transformation of the urban systems. The research made it possible to develop a methodology based on the exchange of data between GIS-based ICT tools and for parametric design, to analyze the microclimatic and performance behavior of recurrent types of urban open spaces in Italian cities, characterized by different climatic conditions, through generic urban patterns, homogeneous in terms of building density and morphology. The goal achieved was to define the critical aspects of urban open spaces with the performance offered in response to the phenomenon of heatwaves, to verify and measure the performance effectiveness of climate-proof intervention categories, to transfer these results in the form of database, hazard maps, and potential levels of adaptation, and to define guidelines for the climate-oriented project.

As a cure or a treatment is yet unavailable, social distancing is considered the key way to prevent it. Mobility restrictions and confinement measures implemented across the world are considered to help reduce air pollution. However, empirical examination of the link between public mobility changes and air pollution during the COVID-19 period remains unavailable. This paper examines the short and long run impacts of mobility changes on carbon monoxide (CO) emissions by employing three dynamic estimators on a panel of 35 countries covering daily data from 15 February to April 17, 2020 - a period when most countries went into strict lockdowns. Findings show a consistent evidence at the all-countries level and across regions that long-run indoor mobility increases reduce CO emissions, while outdoor mobility increases across places such as transit stations, workplaces, grocery & pharmacies, retail & recreation, and parks drive up emissions. Among the regions studied, Europe excluding the EU and the UK (−8.4%), followed by East Asia and the Pacific (−4.3%), sees a larger emissions reduction from increased indoor mobility. While short-run effects are limited in general, emissions in US-Canada respond to indoor and outdoor mobility changes in both the short (1.1%) and long run (−1.4%). Findings overall indicate that reducing unnecessary outdoor mobility could help in maintaining air quality in the post-pandemic world. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","CO emissions; Coronavirus; COVID-19; Environmental quality; Pollution","Air quality; Digital storage; Emission control; Carbon monoxide emissions; Coronaviruses; COVID-19; Economic costs; Environmental quality; Global data; Indoor mobility; Longest run; Mobility changes; Short runs; Carbon monoxide",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103331390

Departure from fossil fuels in urban transport is one of the key challenges for the coming years. Trolleybuses are an important tool in this task, even though their importance was declining in the past. Nowadays, due to, among others, technological development, in particular the availability of high-capacity batteries, their long life and low weight, trolleybus transport is becoming popular again. The use of the existing overhead contact infrastructure of the trolleybus network and small on-board batteries allow expanding the spatial accessibility of zero-emission public transport. Thus, this reduces the social differentiation in access to environmentally friendly transport that does not emit pollutants at the place of operation. The article presents possibilities of using on-board batteries in shaping trolleybus connections with the optimal use of the existing overhead contact lines (OHL). It presents a procedure that allows for the evaluation of the extent to which the OHL should cover the routes of bus lines in order to qualify for trolleybus service in the In-Motion-Charging (IMC) technology. Analysis of the literature shows inadequate scientific studies on combining the advantages of overhead wiring and the development of on-board battery technology in popularising zero-emission transport. This article addresses the key issues related to the use of partially autonomous trolleybuses. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.

Some recent TROPOMI-based estimates of changes in atmospheric NO2 concentrations have neglected the influence of weather variability between the reference and lockdown periods. Here we provide weather-normalized estimates based on a machine learning method (gradient boosting) along with an assessment of the biases that can be expected from methods that omit the influence of weather. We also compare the weather-normalized satellite-estimated NO2 column changes with weather-normalized surface NO2 concentration changes and the CAMS regional ensemble, composed of 11 models, using recently published estimates of emission reductions induced by the lockdown. All estimates show similar NO2 reductions. Locations where the lockdown measures were stricter show stronger reductions, and, conversely, locations where softer measures were implemented show milder reductions in NO2 pollution levels. Average reduction estimates based on either satellite observations (-23 %), surface stations (-43 %), or models (-32 %) are presented, showing the importance of vertical sampling but also the horizontal representativeness. Surface station estimates are significantly changed when sampled to the TROPOMI overpasses (-37 %), pointing out the importance of the variability in time of such estimates. Observation-based machine learning estimates show a stronger temporal variability than model-based estimates. © Author(s) 2021.

However, it should be ensured that replacement diets are, indeed, nutritious and that climate benefits are accurately accounted for. This study uses New Zealand food consumption as a case study for exploring the cumulative climate impact of adopting the national dietary guidelines and the substitution of meat from hypothetical diets. The new GWP* metric is used as it was designed to better reflect the climate impacts of the release of methane than the de facto standard 100-year Global Warming Potential metric (GWP100). A transition at age 25 to the hypothetical dietary guideline diet reduces cumulative warming associated with diet by 7 to 9% at the 100th year compared with consuming the average New Zealand diet. The reduction in diet-related cumulative warming from the transition to a hypothetical meat-substituted diet varied between 12% and 15%. This is equivalent to reducing an average individual’s lifetime warming contribution by 2 to 4%. General improvements are achieved for nutrient intakes by adopting the dietary guidelines compared with the average New Zealand diet; however, the substitution of meat items results in characteristic nutrient differences, and these differences must be considered alongside changes in emission profiles. © 2021 by the authors.

Despite their importance for climate mitigation and soil health, there remains an urgent need for methods that link winter cover crops with regional-scale climate mitigation and adaptation potential. Remote sensing is ideally suited to provide these linkages, yet, cover cropping has not been analyzed extensively in remote sensing research. Methods used for remote sensing of crops from satellites traditionally leverage the difference between visible and near-infrared reflectance to isolate the signal of photosynthetically active vegetation. However, using traditional greenness indices like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) for remotely sensing winter vegetation, such as winter cover crops, is challenging because vegetation reflectance signals are often confounded with reflectance of bare soil and crop residues. Here, we present new and established methods of detecting winter cover crops using remote sensing observations. We find that remote sensing methods that incorporate thermal data in addition to traditional reflectance metrics are best able to distinguish between winter farm management practices. We conclude by addressing the potential of existing and upcoming hyperspectral and thermal missions to further assess agroecosystem function in the context of global change. © 2021 by the authors.

The nuclear model is fully relativistic and includes both one-and two-body currents. We compare our results with recent T2K and MicroBooNE data on carbon and argon targets, and present predictions for DUNE kinematics. © 2020 by the authors.

To overcome these defects, carbon-doped TiO2 ultrathin nanosheets was successfully developed through simple synthesis route of electrospinning-solvothermal-calcination with adjusting the amount of titanium source. The as-prepared material had superior photocatalytic activity, cycle stability and universality, which 89.1 % tetracycline was photodegraded within 120 min under visible-light irradiation (λ ≥ 420 nm).

At present, there are different types of green roofs available, with the intensive, semi-intensive, and extensive the most feasible for urban settlements. This project aims to develop a new model to find the most suitable green roof to reduce air pollution in cities. To achieve this, after an initial study of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats, this study combines the agile multi-criteria decision-making method MIVES with an analytic hierarchy process and sensitivity analysis. This new model has successfully evaluated the suitability of the aforementioned three alternatives in Tehran's residential buildings. This assessment confirmed that this new approach can assist urban managers, architects, and constructors in selecting the most adequate green roof solution to contribute to improving air quality in cities. Nevertheless, all three evaluated solutions require improvement in terms of sustainability.

Here we present soil Hg concentrations from the LUCAS topsoil (0–20 cm) survey including 21,591 samples from 26 European Union countries (one sample every ~200 km2). Deep Neural Network (DNN) learning models were used to map the European soil Hg distribution. DNN estimated a median Hg concentration of 38.3 μg kg−1 (2.6 to 84.7 μg kg−1) excluding contaminated sites. At continental scale, we found that soil Hg concentrations increased with latitude from south to north and with altitude. A GLMM revealed a correlation (R2 = 0.35) of soil Hg concentrations with vegetation activity, normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and soil organic carbon content. This observation corroborates the importance of atmospheric Hg0 uptake by plants and the build-up of the soil Hg pool by litterfall over continental scales. The correlation of Hg concentrations with NDVI was amplified by higher soil organic matter content, known to stabilize Hg in soils through thiol bonds. We find a statistically significant relation between soil Hg levels and coal use in large power plants, proving that emissions from power plants are associated with higher mercury deposition in their proximity. In total 209 hotspots were identified, defined as the top percentile in Hg concentration (&gt;422 μg kg−1). 87 sites (42% of all hotspots) were associated with known mining areas. The sources of the other hotspots could not be identified and may relate to unmined geogenic Hg or industrial pollution. The mapping effort in the framework of LUCAS can serve as a starting point to guide local and regional authorities in identifying Hg contamination hotspots in soils. © 2021 The Authors","Coal; Deep neural networks; Hg; Mercury; Mining; Soil contamination","Deep neural networks; Mapping; Organic carbon; Power plants; Soils; Vegetation; European Union countries; Industrial pollution; Mercury depositions; Normalized difference vegetation index; Regional authorities; Soil organic carbon content; Soil organic matter contents; Vegetation activity; Soil pollution; coal; mercury; organic carbon; artificial neural network; coal; concentration (composition); European Union; mercury (element); mining; soil pollution; spatial analysis; topsoil; air pollution; altitude; Article; atmosphere; chemical bond; climate; concentration (parameter); continental scale; controlled study; correlation analysis; deep neural network; electric power plant; European Union; geographic mapping; geography; industry; land use; latitude; mining; nonhuman; normalized difference vegetation index; plant; pollution transport; priority journal; soil; soil analysis; soil pollution; soil property; spatial analysis; thiol bond; topsoil; vegetation; Europe",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099793016

In this study, we developed an integrated modeling framework to simulate land use dynamics in Inner Mongolia, China under the Shared Socio-economic Pathways (SSPs) during 2015–2050. A computable general equilibrium of land use change model was developed to simulate the regional socio-economic effects on future land use demand. The Dynamics of Land System model was applied to simulate the spatial patterns of land use change. Land use change varied considerably among SSPs. Increased agricultural productivity reduced the demand for cultivated land. Increased livestock system efficiency and decreased animal product consumption reduced grassland demand, benefiting natural grassland recovery. Built-up land increased in all SSPs, with positive relation to GDP growth. Under SSP1, forest area, grassland, and built-up land increased by 19940 km² (12.05%), 9882 km² (1.88%), and 20844 km² (129.19%), respectively, while cultivated land decreased by 10995 km² (−9.80%). Grassland decreased considerably under SSP3 and SSP4, and distributed discretely, mainly concentrated on Xilin Gol League and northwestern Ulanqab. Built-up land sprawled considerably under SSP1 and SSP5, and was mainly concentrated in eastern Tongliao and northern Ordos.

During a 30-day chase period, the allocation of newly assimilated C in the shoots, roots, and soil of grazing-excluded grasslands was higher than that in overgrazed grasslands. But the newly assimilated C allocated to shoots and soil respiration in overgrazed grasslands was significantly higher than that in grazing-excluded grasslands. Thirty days after labeling, 35% and 40% of the newly assimilated C in overgrazed grasslands were lost through shoots and soil respiration, respectively.

One way to accelerate the reduction process is seen in expanding energy planning from single buildings to groups of buildings, forming smart neighborhoods. This study presents a heat and power system optimization for a group of ten residential buildings located in a rural settlement in Germany. Thereby, a simulation platform is interlinked with an optimization model. Demand profiles, solar potentials and options of thermal refurbishment from the simulation platform serve as input data for the optimization model that considers numerous investment options for energy storage units and demand coverage. If costs of GHG emissions are considered in the optimization, a reduction of these emissions by about 60% compared to the status quo is cost-optimal. With regard to heat supply, the cost optimum is identified in the combination of decreasing heat demand through thermal refurbishments and covering the remaining demand mainly by heat from a combined heat and power (CHP) plant in addition with a wood-fired heating system.

A lot of research on LST-LCZ relationship has been done, but mainly in flat terrain. Some studies on UHI in mountainous areas have been conducted, but most of them considered the combined effect of land use/land cover and topography on temperature. To the best of our knowledge no study has been carried out on the LST-LCZ relationship in a complex topography area after removing the topography effect. This paper presents a methodology for assessing the impact of the urban structure on UHII in Beirut, a coastal city with heterogenous urban morphology and complex topography. It was concluded that the main urban variables which contribute to the spatial variability of topographically normalized LST are, in decreasing order of relative importance, the built-up ratio, the pervious surface ratio, the buildings' mean height and mean surface area. The difference in average temperatures between high-rise densely built LCZs and mostly pervious zones exceeded two degrees at nighttime. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","ANOVA; Beirut; Local climate zone; Random forest; Remote sensing; Topography; Urban Heat Island",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104482891

In reality, Australia is very far away from addressing the societal level drivers of health inequity. There is little progressive policy that touches on the conditions of daily life that matter for health, and action to redress inequities in power, money and resources is almost non-existent. In this chapter we ask you to pause this reality and come on a fantastic journey where we envisage how COVID-19 was a great disruptor and accelerator of positive progressive action. We offer glimmers of what life could be like if there was committed and real policy action on the social determinants of health equity. It is vital that the health sector assists in convening the multisectoral stakeholders necessary to turn this fantasy into reality. Chapter 2: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander connection to culture: building stronger individual and collective wellbeing: Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have long maintained that culture (ie, practising, maintaining and reclaiming it) is vital to good health and wellbeing. However, this knowledge and understanding has been dismissed or described as anecdotal or intangible by Western research methods and science. As a result, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture is a poorly acknowledged determinant of health and wellbeing, despite its significant role in shaping individuals, communities and societies. By extension, the cultural determinants of health have been poorly defined until recently. However, an increasing amount of scientific evidence supports what Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have always said — that strong culture plays a significant and positive role in improved health and wellbeing. Owing to known gaps in knowledge, we aim to define the cultural determinants of health and describe their relationship with the social determinants of health, to provide a full understanding of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander wellbeing. We provide examples of evidence on cultural determinants of health and links to improved Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health and wellbeing. We also discuss future research directions that will enable a deeper understanding of the cultural determinants of health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. Chapter 3: Physical determinants of health: healthy, liveable and sustainable communities: Good city planning is essential for protecting and improving human and planetary health. Until recently, however, collaboration between city planners and the public health sector has languished. We review the evidence on the health benefits of good city planning and propose an agenda for public health advocacy relating to health-promoting city planning for all by 2030. Over the next 10 years, there is an urgent need for public health leaders to collaborate with city planners — to advocate for evidence-informed policy, and to evaluate the health effects of city planning efforts. Importantly, we need integrated planning across and between all levels of government and sectors, to create healthy, liveable and sustainable cities for all. Chapter 4: Health promotion in the Anthropocene: the ecological determinants of health: Human health is inextricably linked to the health of the natural environment. In this chapter, we focus on ecological determinants of health, including the urgent and critical threats to the natural environment, and opportunities for health promotion arising from the human health co-benefits of actions to protect the health of the planet. We characterise ecological determinants in the Anthropocene and provide a sobering snapshot of planetary health science, particularly the momentous climate change health impacts in Australia. We highlight Australia’s position as a major fossil fuel producer and exporter, and a country lacking cohesive and timely emissions reduction policy. We offer a roadmap for action, with four priority directions, and point to a scaffold of guiding approaches — planetary health, Indigenous people’s knowledge systems, ecological economics, health co-benefits and climate-resilient development. Our situation requires a paradigm shift, and this demands a recalibration of health promotion education, research and practice in Australia over the coming decade. Chapter 5: Disrupting the commercial determinants of health: Our vision for 2030 is an Australian economy that promotes optimal human and planetary health for current and future generations. To achieve this, current patterns of corporate practice and consumption of harmful commodities and services need to change. In this chapter, we suggest ways forward for Australia, focusing on pragmatic actions that can be taken now to redress the power imbalances between corporations and Australian governments and citizens. We begin by exploring how the terms of health policy making must change to protect it from conflicted commercial interests. We also examine how marketing unhealthy products and services can be more effectively regulated, and how healthier business practices can be incentivised. Finally, we make recommendations on how various public health stakeholders can hold corporations to account, to ensure that people come before profits in a healthy and prosperous future Australia. Chapter 6: Digital determinants of health: the digital transformation: We live in an age of rapid and exponential technological change. Extraordinary digital advancements and the fusion of technologies, such as artificial intelligence, robotics, the Internet of Things and quantum computing constitute what is often referred to as the digital revolution or the Fourth Industrial Revolution (Industry 4.0). Reflections on the future of public health and health promotion require thorough consideration of the role of digital technologies and the systems they influence. Just how the digital revolution will unfold is unknown, but it is clear that advancements and integrations of technologies will fundamentally influence our health and wellbeing in the future. The public health response must be proactive, involving many stakeholders, and thoughtfully considered to ensure equitable and ethical applications and use. Chapter 7: Governance for health and equity: a vision for our future: Coronavirus disease 2019 has caused many people and communities to take stock on Australia’s direction in relation to health, community, jobs, environmental sustainability, income and wealth. A desire for change is in the air. This chapter imagines how changes in the way we govern our lives and what we value as a society could solve many of the issues Australia is facing — most pressingly, the climate crisis and growing economic and health inequities. We present an imagined future for 2030 where governance structures are designed to ensure transparent and fair behaviour from those in power and to increase the involvement of citizens in these decisions, including a constitutional voice for Indigenous peoples. We imagine that these changes were made by measuring social progress in new ways, ensuring taxation for public good, enshrining human rights (including to health) in legislation, and protecting and encouraging an independent media. Measures to overcome the climate crisis were adopted and democratic processes introduced in the provision of housing, education and community development. © 2021 AMPCo Pty Ltd",,"Australia; commercial phenomena; environmental health; forecasting; health care planning; health equity; health promotion; human; indigenous health care; Oceanic ancestry group; social determinants of health; Australia; Commerce; Community Health Planning; Digital Technology; Environmental Health; Forecasting; Health Equity; Health Promotion; Health Services, Indigenous; Humans; Oceanic Ancestry Group; Social Determinants of Health",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105030886

Continuous PM10 and PM2.5 data from a nearby monitoring station were analysed for the year 2019 and compared with modelled concentrations. Annual average concentration at various locations of interest for PM10 and PM2.5 during BAU runs were in the ranges 41.4–65.9 µg/m3 and 30.4–43.7 µg/m3 respectively, compared to during the 30% traffic reduction run ranging at 40.5–59.5 µg/m3 and 29.9–40.3 µg/m3 respectively. The average concentration of PM10 and PM2.5 at the Continuous Air Quality Monitoring Station (CAQMS) was 36.4 µg/m3 and 28.2 µg/m3 respectively.

This study aims to explore the effect of environmental pollution, particulate matter (PM 2.5 μm), carbon monoxide (CO) and Ozone (O3) on daily cases and daily deaths due to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection in a largest metropolitan city London, United Kingdom. Methods: For this study, we selected London, one of the highly populated capitals, and markedly affected due to COVID-19 pandemic. The data on the SARS-CoV-2 daily new cases and deaths were recorded from UK-gov Web ""Coronavirus COVId-19 in the UK, 2020"". The daily environmental pollutants PM 2.5 μm, CO and O3 were recorded from the metrological web ""(London Air Pollution, Air Quality Index- AQI, 2020)"". The daily cases, deaths, PM 2.5 μm, CO and O3 were documented from the date of the occurrence of the first case of SARS-CoV-2 in London, February 24 to November 2, 2020. Results: The SARS-CoV-2 cases and deaths were positively related with environmental pollutants, PM2.5, O3 and CO levels. Additionally, with 1 µm increase in PM2.5 the number of cases and deaths significantly increased by 1.1% and 2.3% respectively. A 1 unit increase in CO level significantly increased the number of cases and deaths by 21.3% and 21.8% respectively. A similar trend was observed in O3, with 1-unit increase, the number of cases and deaths were significantly increased respectively by 0.8% and 4.4%. Conclusions: Environmental pollutants, PM2.5, CO and O3 have a positive association with an increased number of SARS-CoV-2 daily cases and daily deaths in London, UK.

Unlike fuels such as petroleum derivatives, coal, natural gas, biofuels are renewable and sustainable energy sources. Biofuels can be obtained by thermochemical or biochemical methods from agricultural and forestry products, animal and vegetable residues and wastes, organic origin domestic, industrial and urban wastes. Global warming caused by greenhouse gas effect is today shown as the most important common environmental problem in the world. The most important advantage of using biofuels in environmental terms is that there will be a reduction of greenhouse gas impact and acid rain. In this study, it is aimed to produce and characterize jet fuel by converting from pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo) seed oil, which is a sustainable bio energy source, into biofuel, by transesterification method. It has an important place in matters such as environment, sustainability, and reduction of carbon emissions.

However, there are problems related to catalyst durability and release of unburned methane (methane slip). Catalyst durability can be achieved through clever designs of both catalyst material and its regeneration process. In this paper, we studied extensively low temperature regeneration strategies of a commercial methane oxidation catalyst (MOC), a three-way catalyst (TWC) and a diesel oxidation catalyst (DOC) as well as two coupled catalysts; TWC-MOC and DOC-MOC. Methane and propane conversion along with NO2, NO, SO2, CO, N2O and NH3 formation were recorded and analyzed in a laboratory setup using a FTIR multigas analyzer. According to our findings, the MOC and the DOC can be regenerated under a broader range of O2 concentrations whereas the TWC requires a very low O2 concentration or anoxic conditions for efficient regeneration. The conversion increase ranged between 0 and 20 percentage points for methane and 0–45 percentage points for propane depending on the catalyst and regeneration technique. The coupled catalysts were highly effective in methane conversion and possessed higher tolerance against SO2 poisoning compared to single catalysts. The study further revealed that 10 ppm regulation limit of NH3 emission is plausible to exceed during the regeneration of a catalyst. By controlling the exhaust gas composition during the regeneration and length of the regeneration, the NH3 and N2O emissions can be minimized. © 2021 The Author(s)","Ammonia; N2O Emission; Natural gas; Oxidation catalyst; Regeneration method; SO2","Air quality; Ammonia; Catalyst poisoning; Durability; Gas emissions; Gas fuels; Global warming; Methane; Natural gas vehicles; Natural gasoline plants; Propane; Sulfur dioxide; Temperature; Diesel oxidation catalyst; Effective solution; Exhaust Gas Composition; Heavy duty vehicles; Methane conversions; Regeneration process; Regeneration strategies; Three way catalysts; Catalyst regeneration",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100453024

Risks of cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, as well as various types of cancer, have been consistently associated with the exposure to air pollutants. More recently, various studies have also shown that the central nervous system is also attacked by air pollution. Air pollution appears to be strongly associated with a higher risk of cognitive defects, neurodevelopmental (e.g., schizophrenia) and neurodegenerative (e.g., Alzheimer's disease) disorders. Subjects with schizophrenia, as well as subjects with Alzheimer's disease, experience a variety of neuropsychological deficits and cognitive impairments. This determines an adverse effect on social and professional functioning, and it contributes to the long-term disease burden. However, no final conclusions have been drawn on the matter of the direct relationship between schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease. In recent years, the topic of urbanicity and mental health has become increasingly important. Urban exposure to environmental toxins and pollution is currently described as a reliable risk factor for schizophrenia and other psychoses, and it has been demonstrated more and more how exposure to air pollutants is associated with increased risk of dementia. Pathways by which air pollution can target and damage the brain, leading to an increased risk for developing schizophrenia and Alzheimer's disease, are multiple and complex. Results from epidemiological studies suggest potential associations, but are still insufficient to confirm causality. Further studies are needed in order to verify this hypothesis. And if confirmed, the clinical implications could be of substantial relevance for both public and mental health. © 2021 The authors and IOS Press.","Air pollution; Alzheimer's disease; Public health; Schizophrenia",,Book Chapter,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85110815393

It draws on two types of fieldwork data, quantitative and qualitative, including a round of household socio-economic survey questionnaire and qualitative semi-structured interviews. We show that climate-change adaptation is class specific and varies considerably amongst the different classes within the relations of production even in the same village. The local class structure shape ownership and access to natural resources, with implications for both individual adaptive capacities and attempts to organize adaptation practices at the community-level. Specifically, adaptive practice is revealed as being largely contingent on the size of land owned and livelihood options that affects, in turn, households' adaptation capacities and their experiences of climate change. We find that whilst the village inhabitants have initiated various adaptation strategies privately, no community-based adaptation practices could be identified. As such, we call for a more comprehensive understanding of the class nature of climate change for developing effective climate adaptation strategies at the village-community level and especially for community-based adaptation (CBA) models. © 2021 The Authors.

Notably, CO2 is a cheap, abundant, and renewable carbon resource, and its chemical transformation has attracted great attention from society. Because CO2 is in the highest oxidation state of the C atom, the hydrogenation of CO2 is the basic means of converting it to organic chemicals. With the rapid development of H2 generation by water splitting using electricity from renewable resources, reactions using CO2 and H2 have become increasingly important. In the past few decades, the advances of CO2 hydrogenation have mostly been focused on the synthesis of C1 products, such as CO, formic acid and its derivatives, methanol, and methane. In many cases, the chemicals with two or more carbons (C2+) are more important. However, the synthesis of C2+ chemicals from CO2 and H2 is much more difficult because it involves controlled hydrogenation and simultaneous C-C bond formation. Obviously, investigations on this topic are of great scientific and practical significance. In recent years, we have been targeting this issue and have successfully synthesized the basic C2+ chemicals including carboxylic acids, alcohols, and liquid hydrocarbons, during which we discovered several important new reactions and new reaction pathways. In this Account, we systematically present our work and insights in a broad context with other related reports.We discovered a reaction of acetic acid production from methanol, CO2 and H2, which is different from the well-known methanol carbonylation. We also discovered a reaction of C3+ carboxylic acids syntheses using ethers to react with CO2 and H2, which proceeds via olefins as intermediates. Following the new reaction, we realized the synthesis of acetamide by introducing various amines, which may inspire the development of further catalytic schemes for preparing a variety of special chemicals using carbon dioxide as a building block.We designed a series of homogeneous catalysts to accelerate the production of C2+ alcohols via CO2 hydrogenation. In the heterogeneously catalyzed CO2 hydrogenation, we discovered the role of water in enhancing the synthesis of C2+ alcohols. We also developed a series of routes for ethanol production using CO2 and H2 to react with some substrates, such as methanol, dimethyl ether, aryl methyl ether, lignin, or paraformaldehyde.We designed a catalyst that can directly hydrogenate CO2 to C5+ hydrocarbons at 200 °C, not via the traditional CO or methanol intermediates. We also designed a route to couple homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis, where exceptional results are achieved at 180 °C. ©",,,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105112362

In regions where agriculture has been constrained because of soil degradation and climate change, CSA aims to implement soil-based strategies that restore soil function and increase carbon storage. The extent to which such strategies succeed in achieving mitigation, adaptation and productivity goals is referred to as climate-smartness. The co-evolution of yield and Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) over the years presents a proxy for the trade-off between productivity, soil fertility and carbon sequestration. Yield and SOC are widely monitored, analysed and used to inform CSA planning. Yet their analysis is often conducted separately and for a small number of years, which neglects long-term soil fertility dynamics and their impact on crops. Given the absence of integrated climate-smartness metrics to capture the trade-offs and synergies between SOC and yield, we present a soil-based Climate-Smartness Index (SCSI). The SCSI is computed using normalized indicators of trend and variability of annual changes on yield and SOC data. The SCSI was calculated for a set of published experiments that compared Conservation Agriculture (CA) practices with conventional management. The CA treatments scored higher SCSI during the first 5 years of evaluation as compared to conventional management. Analysis of the temporal dynamics of climate-smartness indicated that minimum SCSI values typically occurred before 5 years after the start of the experiment, indicating potential trade-offs between SOC and yield. Conversely, SCSI values peaked between 5 and 10 years. After 20 years, the SCSI tended towards zero, as substantial changes in either SOC or yield are no longer evidenced. The SCSI can be calculated for annual crops under any soil management and at different time periods, providing a consistent metric for climate-smartness across both practices and time. © 2021","Climate-smart agriculture; Climate-smartness; Conservation agriculture; Metrics","agricultural policy; carbon storage; climate change; long-term change; soil carbon; soil degradation; soil organic matter; trade-off; trend analysis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100635958

OBJECTIVE: This article describes farmers and policymakers' responses to mitigate the adverse effects of Covid-19 on the agricultural sector. We then assess the responses' possible effects on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. METHODS: The study is based on surveys conducted with farmers, traders, and extension staff in Burkina Faso, Colombia, and France, and literature. We used the Cool Farm Tool calculator to assess GHG emissions associated with fertilizer production, crop production and produce transportation to international markets for the three main cash crops in the three countries. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: We identified contrasting responses by the agricultural sector mostly driven by changes in the consumption patterns at local or international levels. We also identified contrasting state responses to mitigate Covid-19. These responses at farm and policy scales led to similar trends in decreasing carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions across the studied countries. However, none of the studied countries linked Covid-19 response measures to long-term climate change mitigation actions. Therefore, an opportunity to sustain Covid-19 induced short-term decreases in GHG emissions was overlooked. SIGNIFICANCE: Analyzing the impacts that Covid-19 had on agricultural systems and the decision taken by policymakers to handle its direct and indirect effects can help society draw lessons on how to improve climate action. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Agricultural model; Agricultural sectors; Climate change; Greenhouse gas emissions","adaptation; carbon dioxide; cash cropping; climate change; COVID-19; crop production; farming system; fertilizer application; greenhouse gas; policy making; Burkina Faso; Colombia; France",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85100697674

The Regional Climate Models (RCMs) have been extensively employed to study the impact of climate change on various hydrologic components. However, these climate models are subjected to a large number of uncertainties, which demands a careful selection of an appropriate climate model. To rationalize such uncertainties and select suitable models, a multi-criteria ranking technique has been employed. Ranking of RCMs has been done on its capability to simulate hydrologic components, i.e., simulations of the surface runoff by employing Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT), exercising Entropy, and PROMETHEE-2 approach. The spatial extent of changes in the hydrologic components is examined over the Ganga river basin, using the top three ranked RCMs, for a period from January 2021-December 2100. For the monsoon months (June-September), the future annual mean surface runoff will decrease substantially (−50% to −10%), while the flows for post-monsoon months (October-December) are projected to increase (10–20%). Extremes are noted to increase during the non-monsoon months, while a substantial decrease in medium events is also highlighted. Snow-melt is projected to increase during the months of November-March (50% to 400%). Major loss of recharge is expected to occur in the central part of the basin. The investigation presents not only a reliable impact assessment but also the valuation of future alterations in individual hydrological components and will furnish the administrators with substantive information, a prerequisite to formulating ameliorative policies. © 2021 International Association for Hydro-environment Engineering and Research, Asia Pacific Division","Climate change; CORDEX; Ganga River; Landuse change; Regional Climate Models (RCM); Soil Water Assessment Tool (SWAT)","Atmospheric thermodynamics; Climate models; Decision making; Land use; Runoff; Soil moisture; Stream flow; Watersheds; Adaptation strategies; Hydrologic components; Hydrologic response; Impact assessments; Multi-criteria ranking; Regional climate models; Soil water assessment tool; Spatiotemporal effects; Climate change; climate change; climate effect; climate modeling; environmental impact assessment; hydrological response; land use change; rainfall-runoff modeling; regional climate; river basin; soil and water assessment tool; spatiotemporal analysis; water budget; Ganges Basin",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104106661

These informed the launch of one of the most important international policies called Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation Plus (REDD+) to combat forest destruction. REDD+ assumes that communities will have increased assets to natural capital which will enhance their livelihood portfolio and mitigate the effects of climate variability and change across biomes. The aim of this study is to ascertain the livelihoods impacts of forest carbon protection within the context of REDD+ in Cross River State, Nigeria. Six forest communities were chosen across three agroecological zones of the State. Anchored on the Sustainable Livelihood Framework, a set of questionnaires were administered to randomly picked households. The results indicate that more than half of the respondents aligned with financial payment and more natural resources as the perceived benefits of carbon protection. More so, a multinomial logistic regression showed that income was the main factor that influenced respondent’s support for forest carbon protection. Analysis of income trends from the ‘big seven’ non-timber forest resources in the region showed increase in Gnetum africanum, Bushmeat, Irvingia gabonensis, Garcinia kola, while carpolobia spp., Randia and rattan cane revealed declining income since inception of REDD+. The recorded increase in household income was attributed to a ban in logging. It is recommended that the forest communities should be more heavily involved in the subsequent phases of the project implementation to avoid carbon leakages. © 2021 by the authors.

Special attention is brought to the visual inspection of the rock fabric and its variations across the reservoir in order to better constrain interpretations and establish relationships within an otherwise scattered dataset. Porosity and permeability variations are categorised into two trends, a mineralogical and diagenetic trend, which can both form tight rock. For chalk containing >7% quartz and > 4% clay, porosity decreases linearly from 35% to 21% and permeability from 0.5 mD to 0.07 mD with increasing quartz content. The amount of quartz rather than clay appears as an effective tool to estimate the petrophysical properties of impure chalk. Below 7% quartz and 4% clay, compaction and cementation decrease porosity and permeability in two steps along transects from oil- to water-bearing intervals. A first step of predominantly mechanical compaction reducing porosity and permeability from >41% to 37% and from 3 to 3.5 mD to 1.5–2.5 mD, respectively, is followed by a phase of chemical compaction and cementation that further deteriorates petrophysical properties. In Ekofisk Fm., stylolitised chalk and deposits located adjacent to chert horizons display singular petrophysical properties that do not fit the observed trends. The outliers likely result from phases of local chemical compaction and early cementation associated with chert formation. Porosity-permeability functions and uncertainty analyses are also proposed for the different controlling factors and at different scales of observation. The proposed petrophysical relationships are instrumental in building more realistic reservoir models and can assist geoscientists in interpreting and upscaling the large amount of geological data collected in chalk fields. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Chalk reservoir; Diagenesis; Mineralogy; Petrophysics; Porosity-permeability relationship","Aquifers; Cementing (shafts); Compaction; Digital storage; Energy storage; Limestone; Petroleum reservoir engineering; Petrophysics; Porosity; Quartz; Uncertainty analysis; Underwater mineralogy; Controlling factors; Diagenetic process; Mechanical compaction; Permeability functions; Petrophysical analysis; Petrophysical properties; Petrophysical relationship; Reservoir engineering; Mechanical permeability; chalk; deposition; diagenesis; energy storage; hydrocarbon reservoir; mineralogy; permeability; physicochemical property; porosity; reservoir rock; Atlantic Ocean; North Sea",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101678176

Successful sustainability initiatives are vastly described in literature, especially for the operations phase. In turn, reports on unsuccessful cases are small in number, or are overlooked and undiscussed, possibly providing a biased view of reality, thus hiding eventual failures. The main objective of this article is to highlight those latter cases and discuss the causes of such results. Through a systematic review of empirical-based scientific literature on ineffective or less successful sustainability actions in the areas of ‘Energy’ and ‘Buildings’ on campus operations, it was possible to identify common potential triggering factors for the unsuccess. These were classified into four groups according to the number of occurrences in literature: technical, economic, climatic and behavioral. Within these groups, the main causes include: inadequate planning, the inappropriate design of systems, the lack of proper maintenance, the low return on investment, mismatch between the actions and the local climate, or the uncertainty of long-term commitment to a sustainable behavior. Based on these findings, a set of lessons were disclosed for each group, which may be helpful for all those who are involved in decision-making, planning or monitoring of sustainability actions on campus, as a means to help anticipate and overcome difficulties in early phases. Lastly, more empirically based literature is encouraged, as the disproportion between information on the description of actions and on their impacts is notorious. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Buildings actions; Campus operations; Energy actions; Sustainability; Sustainable campus","Decision making; Investments; Building action; Campus operation; Efficient use of energy; Energy; Energy action; Higher education institutions; Operation phase; Sustainable campus; Systematic Review; University campus; Sustainable development",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102634126

The Northern Emirates of the United Arab Emirates (NEUAE) had imposed intense preventive lockdown measures. On the first of April 2020, a lockdown was implemented. It was assumed, due to lower emissions, that the air quality and Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity (SUHII) had been strengthened significantly. In this research, three parameters for Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD), and SUHII variables were examined through the NEUAE. we evaluated the percentage of the change in these parameters as revealed by satellite data for 2 cycles in 2019 (March 1st to June 30th) and 2020 (March 1st to June 30th). The core results showed that during lockdown periods, the average of NO2, AOD, and SUHII levels declined by 23.7%, 3.7%, and 19.2%, respectively, compared to the same period in 2019. Validation for results demonstrates a high agreement between the predicted and measured values. The agreement was as high as R2=0.7, R2=0.6, and R2=0.68 for NO2, AOD, and night LST, respectively, indicating significant positive linear correlations. The current study concludes that due to declining automobile and industrial emissions in the NEUAE, the lockdown initiatives substantially lowered NO2, AOD, and SUHII. In addition, the aerosols did not alter significantly since they are often linked to the natural occurrence of dust storms throughout this time of the year. The pandemic is likely to influence several policy decisions to introduce strategies to control air pollution and SUHII. Lockdown experiences may theoretically play a key role in the future as a possible solution for air pollution and SUHII abatement. © 2020 The Authors","AOD; COVID-19; Lockdown; NO2; Northern emirates; SUHII","Aerosols; Air quality; Atmospheric temperature; Health risks; Industrial emissions; Losses; Nitrogen oxides; Storms; Viruses; Aerosol optical depths; Linear correlation; Nitrogen dioxides; Policy decisions; Severe acute respiratory syndrome; Surface urban heat islands; Three parameters; United Arab Emirates; Air pollution control; nitrogen dioxide; air quality; atmospheric pollution; COVID-19; disease spread; heat island; policy implementation; public health; symptom; viral disease; aerosol; Aerosol Optical Depth; air pollution; air quality; Article; comparative study; controlled study; coronavirus disease 2019; cost effectiveness analysis; decision making; dust storm; environmental impact; environmental parameters; environmental protection; experience; human; lockdown; pandemic; pollutant; pollution control; priority journal; spatiotemporal analysis; surface area; Surface Urban Heat Island Intensity; United Arab Emirates; urban area; air pollutant; air pollution; animal; city; communicable disease control; environmental monitoring; heat; island (geological); United Arab Emirates; Coronavirus; Air Pollutants; Air Pollution; Animals; Cities; Communicable Disease Control; COVID-19; Environmental Monitoring; Hot Temperature; Humans; Islands; SARS-CoV-2; United Arab Emirates",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099139922

The development of hydrogen from wind energy is an excellent way to store the excess wind power produced, as the produced hydrogen can be used not only as clean fuel but also as input for various industries. Considering the good wind potentials of Yazd province, the variety of industries that are active in this area, and the central location of this province in Iran, which gives it ample access to major transport routes and other industrial hubs, hydrogen production from wind power in this province could benefit not only this region but the entire country. Given these considerations, we conducted a technical, economic, and environmental assessment of the potential for wind power generation and hydrogen production in Yazd province. Overall, the assessments showed that the best locations for harvesting wind energy in this province are Bahabad and Halvan stations. For these two stations, it is recommended to use EWT DW 52-900 turbine to take advantage of its higher nominal capacity to achieve higher electricity and hydrogen output and emission reduction. For Abarkoh and Kerit stations, which have a low wind energy potential, it is recommended to use small turbines such as Eovent EVA120 H-Darrieus. Also, economic and technical assessments showed that it is not economically justified to harvest wind energy in Ardakan station. The results of ranking the stations with the Step-wise Weight Assessment Ratio Analysis (SWARA) and Evaluation based on Distance from Average Solution (EDAS) techniques showed that Bahabad station was introduced as the best place to produce hydrogen from wind energy. © 2021 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC","Economic evaluation; Environmental issues; Hydrogen production; Multi-criteria decision-making; Technical assessment; Wind energy","Economic analysis; Electric power generation; Emission control; Hydrogen production; Solar power generation; Transportation routes; Wind power; Case-studies; Economics evaluations; Energy; Energy demands; Environmental issues; Multi criteria decision-making; Multi-criterion decision-making; Multicriteria decision-making; Power; Technical assessment; Decision making",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85104609339

Changes in plant cover derived from different agricultural practices induce variations in the quality of plant residue inputs and in the soil microbial community structure and activity, which may enhance the storage and protection of organic carbon (OC) and nitrogen (N) within aggregates. The aim of this study was to assess how differences in the chemical composition of plant residues in combination with tillage management practices affect the local microbial community activity and structure, and subsequent soil aggregation and OC and N dynamics in an organic, rainfed almond (Prunus dulcis Mill.) orchard. In the laboratory, three types of plant residue (shoots, roots, and the combination of both) coming from different species belonging to each agricultural practice (reduced tillage, reduced tillage plus green manure, reduced tillage plus organic manure, and no-tillage) were mixed with their respective soils and the CO2 released was measured over 243 days at 60% WHC and 28 °C. Water-stable aggregates (including microaggregates within macroaggregates), enzymatic activities related to carbon (dehydrogenase and β-glucosidase) and N (urease) cycling, and the microbial biomass and community structure through phospholipid fatty acid analysis, were measured at the end of the incubation period. Our results indicate that the chemical composition of plant residues controls the microbial community response, mediating decomposition and the incorporation of OC and N in stable aggregates. Therefore, the incorporation of labile and N-rich plant residues into the soil by reduced tillage is recommended since mixing roots and shoots from green manure increased the formation of free micro-aggregates and improved OC and N stabilization in our semiarid agroecosystem. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Carbon sequestration; Cover crops; Microbial community activity and structure; Organic woody crops; Plant residue decomposition; Tillage practices","Aggregates; Chemical analysis; Climate change; Crops; Ecosystems; Fatty acids; Fertilizers; Forestry; Manures; Microorganisms; Nitrogen; Organic carbon; Phospholipids; Soils; Stabilization; Carbon sequestration; Cover crops; Microbial community activities; Microbial community structures; Organic woody crop; Organics; Plant residue decomposition; Plant residues; Reduced tillage; Tillage practices; Decomposition; agricultural ecosystem; agricultural practice; carbon dioxide; chemical composition; community response; decomposition; microbial activity; microbial community; plant residue; rainfed agriculture; soil microorganism; soil nutrient; soil stabilization; Prunus dulcis",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85102293507

In order to propose sound policies aimed at lowering such emissions, policy makers favor tools that are informative in the economic and environmental dimensions simultaneously. In this study we offer a systems-based approach which is intended to do just that by developing a spatially and temporally disaggregated price equilibrium mathematical model for a food production and distribution system and applying it to the U.S. apple supply chain. We considered three emission reduction interventions: a carbon tax, a land-sparing incentive, and new emission-reduction technologies. We find that R&D which leads to storage technologies with lower carbon emission rates has the greatest potential for emission reduction.

Wind speed and COVID-19 had positive correlation in Pakistan and its provinces. The inverted U-shaped dose–response curve was found for wind speed and COVID-19 in Punjab. Initially, the dose–response curve showed a positive link between wind speed and COVID-19 in Pakistan, Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad Capital Territory. Later, it becomes downward sloped in Sindh, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and Islamabad Capital Territory. The expected log count of COVID-19 was increased by 0.113 times (Pakistan), 0.074 times (Punjab), 0.042 times (Sindh), and 0.082 times (Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) for a 1 km/h increase in the wind speed. The correlation between particulate matter and COVID-19 was positive (Pakistan, Punjab, and Islamabad Capital Territory) and negative (Sindh). The dose–response curve for particulate matter and COVID-19 had inverted U-shaped (Pakistan, Punjab, and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa) positively sloped (Islamabad Capital Territory), and negatively sloped (Sindh). The inverted U-shaped association shows that the COVID-19 initially increased due to a rise in the particulate matter but reduced when the particulate matter was above the threshold level. The particulate matter was also responsible to wear face masks and restricted mobility. The expected log count of COVID-19 cases was reduced by 0.005 times in Sindh for 1 unit increase in particulate matter. It is recommended to reduce particulate matter to control respiratory problems.

This paper reports the development of a unique manufacturing method using a blend of pitch and linear low-density polyethylene (LLDPE) from which it is possible to obtain precursors that are less brittle than neat pitch fibres. This study reports on the structure and properties of pitch and LLDPE blend precursors with LLDPE content ranging from 5 wt% to 20 wt%. Fibre microstructure was determined using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), which showed a two-phase region having distinct pitch fibre and LLDPE regions. Tensile testing of neat pitch fibres showed low strain to failure (brittle), but as the percentage of LLDPE was increased, the strain to failure and tensile strength both increased by a factor of more than 7. DSC characterisation of the melting/crystallization behaviour of LLDPE showed melting occurred around 120 °C to 124 °C, with crystallization between 99 °C and 103 °C. TGA measurements showed that for 5 wt%, 10 wt% LLDPE thermal stability was excellent to 800 °C.

Ecosystem services (ES) associated with these spaces and spatial factors, such as distances and the presence of substitutes, are of great importance. These aspects, previously studied in the literature, are rarely focused on the economic valuation, through which benefits are revealed. This paper evaluates the creation of AGs in a peri-urban degraded agroecosystem in Murcia (SE-Spain). The values of ES are quantified economically, so are the influences of the socioeconomic and spatial characteristics. A survey was undertaken, from which the willingness to pay (WTP) for owning an AG and the factors influencing the valuation were determined. The results indicate that provisioning services are the ES valued most highly. The valuation of the project for the whole population is 5.4 €/household/month, with a WTP of 17.2 €/household/month for owning an AG plot. Multivariate analysis showed the importance of ES and spatial factors in this valuation. This WTP spatial study shows the existence of local patterns to be considered in the evaluation of new AGs location alternatives.

Currently, wild and domesticated populations (including genetically modified [GM] varieties) occur in this country and gene flow among them has shaped the species’ genetic diversity and structure, setting a complex and challenging scenario for its conservation. Moreover, recent gene flow from GM cultivars to wild Mexican cotton populations has been reported since 2011. In situ conservation of G. hirsutum requires knowledge about the extent of its geographic distribution, both wild and domesticated, as well as the possible routes and mechanisms that contribute to gene flow between the members of the species wild-to-domesticated continuum (i.e., the primary gene pool). However, little is known about the distribution of feral populations that could facilitate gene flow by acting as bridges. In this study, we analyzed the potential distribution of feral cotton based on an ecological niche modeling approach and discussed its implications in the light of the distribution of wild and domesticated cotton. Then, we examined the processes that could be leading to the escape of seeds from the cultivated fields. Our results indicate that the climatic suitability of feral plants in the environmental and geographic space is broad and overlaps with areas of wild cotton habitat and crop fields, suggesting a region that could bridge cultivated cotton and its wild relatives by allowing gene flow between them. This study provides information for management efforts focused on the conservation of wild populations, native landraces, and non-GM domesticated cotton at its center of origin and genetic diversity. © Copyright © 2021 Alavez, Cuervo-Robayo, Martínez-Meyer and Wegier.","conservation; ecological niche modeling ENM; gene flow; upland cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.); wild-to-domesticated complex",,Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85107527436

In Netherlands, the option of CCS has been the subject of debate for a long time, as three unsuccessful projects – two onshore in Barendrecht and the Northern regions, and one offshore near the Port of Rotterdam – demonstrate. Nevertheless, CCS has been accorded an important place in the current Dutch climate policies, being expected to contribute up to 7 Megaton of CO2 reduction. This is reflected in a fresh crop of CCS project plans. For the most, these plans have a long way to go from the drawing board to actual operations due to the technical, economic, legal and societal challenges ahead. In this article we review the status and possibilities of CCS in Netherlands based on an analysis of existing literature in the relevant disciplines. First, a brief overview of the technology options for carbon capture and storage or utilization is given. This is followed by a detailed analysis of the governmental support for CCS, given the vital role that fit-for-purpose legal frameworks and policy instruments will play in CCS deployment. Technical, legal and policy uncertainties translates into factors inhibiting CCS investment and so the paper then presents a CCS investment project to illustrate how such risks affect the business case for CCS. Finally, bearing in mind that societal acceptance has proved to be a major barrier for CCS, both in Netherlands and elsewhere, the conditions that enhance public acceptance of CCS are examined. Our work shows that while CCS is technically a straightforward proposition, its deployment has historically been hindered by the lack of a sound business case and a compelling and stable socio-technical narrative. The main argument in favor of CCS today is that it offers a transition pathway for rapidly and massively reducing CO2 emissions beyond what could be accomplished by alternative methods like electrification and renewable fuels in near future. The introduction of new financial instruments, increased government support and an improvement in social engagement appear to have enhanced the prospects of CCS in Netherlands, but we feel it is premature to assume that this time everything is different. © Copyright © 2021 Akerboom, Waldmann, Mukherjee, Agaton, Sanders and Kramer.","carbon capture and storage (CCS); carbon capture and utilization (CCU); climate action plan 2030+; sustainability; uncertainties analysis","Carbon dioxide; Climate change; Offshore oil well production; Carbon capture and sequestrations; Global climate changes; Government supports; Investment projects; New financial instrument; Policy instruments; Technology options; Transition pathway; Carbon capture",Review,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106027569

Energy demands and associated emissions in the industrial sector are continuously increasing. The utilization of high temperature heat pumps (HTHPs) operating with natural fluids presents an environmentally friendly solution with great potential to increase energy efficiency and reduce emissions in industrial processes. Ammonia-water absorption–compression heat pumps (ACHPs) combine the technologies of an absorption and vapor compression heat pump using a zeotropic mixture of ammonia and water as working fluid. The given characteristics, such as the ability to achieve high sink temperatures with comparably large temperature lifts and high coefficient of performance (COP) make the ACHP interesting for utilization in various industrial high temperature applications. This work reviews the state of technology and identifies existing challenges based on conducted experimental investigations. In this context, 23 references with capacities ranging from 1.4 kW to 4500 kW are evaluated, achieving sink outlet temperatures from 45◦ C to 115◦ C and COPs from 1.4 to 11.3. Existing challenges are identified for the compressor concerning discharge temperature and lubrication, for the absorber and desorber design for operation and liquid–vapor mixing and distribution and the choice of solution pump. Recent developments and promising solutions are then highlighted and presented in a comprehensive overview. Finally, future trends for further studies are discussed. The purpose of this study is to serve as a starting point for further research by connecting theoretical approaches, possible solutions and experimental results as a resource for further developments of ammonia-water ACHP systems at high temperature operation. © 2021 by the authors.

However, the relative role of these drivers on decomposition process in the context of plant invasions has been little investigated, particularly in the Himalaya. In this study, we investigated the effect of plant invasion, litter quality and altitude on decomposition rate at multiple sites along an elevational gradient in Kashmir Himalaya. We used the standard litterbag incubation experiment to compare decomposition rates among the plots with- and without global plant invader Leucanthemum vulgare, using both standard (cellulosic filter papers) and local (pine needles) litter types. Our results show that invasion had a significant effect on decomposition rates of both the litter types with relatively higher decomposability in case of invaded plots than the uninvaded ones. Litter quality was the predominant factor in controlling the decomposition rate as evidenced from much higher decomposability (about eight times) of filter papers as compared to pine needles. Also, altitude had a significantly negative effect on decomposition rate of both the litter types, possibly through the influence on abiotic conditions (temperature and precipitation in particular). Our results highlight that, although multiple factors are affecting the litter decomposition at the regional scale, the litter quality exerted the stronger influence. Our study suggests that invasive L. vulgare by altering the litter decomposition rates could greatly influence the cycling of nutrients in the invaded landscapes. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS","Filter paper; Leucanthemum vulgare; Litter decomposition; Litter quality; Pine needle; Plant invasion","abiotic factor; biogeochemical cycle; biological invasion; coniferous tree; decomposition; environmental conditions; habitat type; litter; Himalayas; Jammu and Kashmir; Leucanthemum vulgare",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85101512940

The study analysed carbon (C) stock patterns and examined the importance of environmental variables in predicting carbon stock in biomass and soils of the Indian Himalayan Region (IHR). We conducted a synthesis of 100 studies reporting biomass carbon stock and 67 studies on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock from four land-uses: forests, plantation, agroforest, and herbaceous ecosystem from the IHR. Machine learning techniques were used to examine the importance of various environmental variables in predicting carbon stock in biomass and soils. Despite large variations in biomass C and SOC stock (mean ± SD) within the land-uses, natural forests have the highest biomass C stock (138.5 ± 87.3 Mg C ha−1), and plantation forests exhibited the highest SOC stock (168.8 ± 74.4 Mg C ha−1) in the top 1-m of soils. The relationship between the environmental variables (altitude, latitude, precipitation, and temperature) and carbon stock was not significantly correlated. The prediction of biomass carbon and SOC stock using different machine learning techniques (Adaboost, Bagging, Random Forest, and XGBoost) shows that the XGBoost model can predict the carbon stock for the IHR closely. Our study confirms that the carbon stock in the IHR vary on a large scale due to a diverse range of land-use and ecosystems within the region. Therefore, predicting the driver of carbon stock on a single environmental variable is impossible for the entire IHR. The IHR possesses a prominent carbon sink and biodiversity pool. Therefore, its protection is essential in fulfilling India's commitment to nationally determined contributions (NDC).

It is important to reduce transportation emissions, such as enhancing bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure networks and encouraging users to use public transportation. The main problem in Bandar Penggaram, Batu Pahat is high carbon emissions that came from motorised transportations. The objective of this research is to identify the existing condition of walking and cycling facilities and to propose ways to improve the existing condition of walking and cycling facilities towards green mobility in Bandar Penggaram, Batu Pahat. The analysis of this research involved areas around Dataran Penggaram, Batu Pahat which focuses on the main roads that tend to produce high carbon emissions. The method that is used in this research is the mixed methods which consist of quantitative and qualitative method. The first finding of the observation shows that the focused site or development integrates pedestrian and cycling networks with other road activities. There are also bicycle parking facilities, separate bike paths parallel to major roads and dedicated lanes for walking and cycling. Secondly, the weather and distance are the limitations of residents who walk and cycle. Next, the best criteria to overcome the limitations when integrating pedestrian and cycling networks with other road activities are planting shaded trees and build roofs over dedicated lanes for walking and cycling. So, the facilities need to be maintained at this level and improve or implemented to reduce the number of private vehicles on the road. Hence, less carbon emission from motorised transportations is achieved when more private vehicles are off the road. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.","cycling; green mobility; Pedestrian; transportation; walking and cycling facilities","Bicycles; Biodiversity; Carbon; Pedestrian safety; Roads and streets; Carbon emissions; Green mobility; Infrastructure networks; Mixed method; Parking facilities; Private vehicles; Public transportation; Quantitative and qualitative methods; Road vehicles",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85106577232

This technical note investigates a delimited portion of the potential of currently unutilised heat which has the possibility to supply district heating networks in the UK. The UK industrial sector, wastewater treatment facilities and the existing UK waste incineration plants all produce waste heat available in a temperature range suitable for extraction into district heating networks via commercialised techniques broadly used in other countries. This technical note presents a comparative literature review, comparing UK statistics and studies with performance data based on Swedish operational facilities. It finds 51.7TWh of currently unutilised heat could be recovered annually, with a significant associated emission decrease if incorporated into the heat supply of the UK building stock. A quantitative analysis is carried out to compare the identified potential with the current UK heat demand and the potential impact on the UK carbon emissions is estimated. The calculations indicate a reduction of 14% in the required UK total domestic heat supply, despite only including a limited fraction of the available waste heat potential. Practical application: This technical note serves to highlight and emphasise the large amount of available waste heat potential currently not utilised in the UK. By estimating the impact of waste heat utilisation and incorporation into district heating and heat networks in the UK, the technical note aims to fuel discussion around the further incorporation of waste heat to be utilised in the UK heat sector. © The Author(s) 2021.","decarbonise heating; district heating; reduce emissions; Waste heat potential",,Note,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85099317579

The canonical dipole emission model is parametrized in terms of the local optical material constants and the local quasi-Fermi level splitting using the detailed balance relation between local absorption and emission rates. The framework obtained in this way is shown to reproduce the generalized Kirchhoff relations between the luminescent emission from metal halide perovskite slabs under uniform excitation and the slab absorptance of light with arbitrary angle of incidence. Use of the proper local density of transverse photon states in the local emission rate includes cavity effects in the generalized Planck law for internal spontaneous emission, which are neglected in the conventional Van Roosbroeck-Shockley formalism and avoids spurious divergencies due to non-radiative energy transfer via longitudinal modes.

As the law applies only to France or French territories, there is argued incentive for French-based companies to move their extractive activities abroad. France also passed in 2017 a remarkable ‘due diligence’ law—the Duty of Care Act—that holds large French companies responsible for impacts of their activities worldwide, including subsidiaries and the totality of their supply chains. The law's potential reach is unclear as there is currently no case law to guide decision-making and application of its provisions. This Act merits close examination as it is the most comprehensive law globally aimed at enforcing corporate responsibility and requires companies of a defined size to create plans to anticipate and mitigate risk to human and environmental rights. Companies that violate the law by failing to address risk through a comprehensive plan may face stiff penalties and can be brought to court by ‘interested parties’ in French courts. The Act allows for those facing risk of harm or those acting on their behalf, including NGOs, to bring claims within France's judicial system, which is arguably significant in countries with weak enforcement or legal capacity. The first lawsuit under the Act was brought against French-based Total by a consortium of French and Ugandan NGOs over the company's alleged failure to adequately address risk to human and environmental rights in Uganda. However, while the case remains pending in the French court system, there are several opportunities to learn from analysis of this case and its significance in a global context. This perspective article discusses the current case and analyses the potential gaps and opportunities of application of the law. Further, this research considers the role of the French law as a model for other countries that are aiming to develop similar legislation or extend the reach of their own ‘due diligence’ frameworks. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Energy justice; Environmental impacts; French Duty of Care Act; Human rights; Oil and gas extraction; Uganda",,Short Survey,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85103262898

In many cases, food waste (FW) management is established by making a single assessment for its sustainability based on economical or environmental impacts. However, social impact assessments on stakeholders are often incomplete or missing, and its efficiency is seldom measured. Decision-making in waste management strategies, such as the acquisition of appropriate waste treatment sites or methods used, frequently involves multiple stakeholders such as government, municipalities, industries, experts, or public sectors. Due to the complication of differing criteria and alternatives in FW management technology, a multi-criteria decision-making (MCDM) methodology is recommended to certify the quality of the decision-making process. This paper reviews the use of MCDM as decision supporting techniques in modelling and analysing decision making in situations with multiple stakeholders for FW management. The synthesis results obtained through the MCDM tool will be more reliable when requesting confirmation from stakeholders based on a recommended minimum range of criteria for each sustainability dimension in the FW issues. Finally, potential studies in this area have been proposed. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing.

We aim to elucidate the evolutionary behavior of carbon and sulfur emanating from deep environments and flowing in surficial environment so as to better understand the cycling of these metals in water environments. To characterize the evolution of carbon and sulfur species in surficial environment as the fluid emanates from a deep saline aquifer, we monitored the chemical and isotopic (δ13CDIC and δ34SSO4) parameters over a 700-m stretch on a stream-pond system situated on the saline-freshwater line of the Edwards Aquifer’s artesian zone. A three-tier evolution process associated with the interaction of a deep saline fluid with a fresh-ponded water was observed, namely: A deep fluid control zone characterized by decreasing pH values and relatively high total dissolved solids (TDS) concentrations along the stream path; a mixing zone of the deep fluid and fresh-ponded water where the TDS concentrations showed a sharp decline and a continual decrease in pH values; and a fresh-ponded water-controlled zone with a stable pH value and low TDS concentrations. The decreasing pH values were a result of CO2 outgassing due to the relatively high CO2 partial pressures (10–2.53 atm) relative to atmospheric (10–3.50 atm) in the aqueous system, and the high TDS concentrations were attributed to the deep saline fluid emanating at the well-head. The enrichment in the δ13CDIC and δ34SSO4 for the initial stream path reflects the kinetic isotopic fractionations associated with CO2 outgassing and with the microbial conversion. The zonation of the evolutionary process indicates that (i) solutes play a critical role in the evolution of carbon and sulfur in surficial environment, (ii) kinetic and chemical fractionation are the dominant processes controlling carbon evolution, and (iii) microbial metabolism primarily controls sulfate fractionation and evolution through the conversion of sulfate to thiosulfate. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Carbon; CO2 outgassing; Deep saline fluids; Microbial metabolism; Oxygen and hydrogen isotopes; Sulfur; Surficial environments","Aquifers; Carbon; Carbon dioxide; Isotopes; Metabolism; pH; Process control; Rivers; Sulfur; Sulfur compounds; Wellheads; Chemical Fractionation; Deep saline aquifers; Evolutionary process; Isotopic fractionations; Microbial conversions; Microbial metabolism; Surficial environment; Total dissolved solids; Saline water; carbon; carbon dioxide; dissolved organic matter; fresh water; lake water; sodium chloride; sulfate; sulfur; thiosulfate; aquifer; carbon cycle; carbon dioxide; carbon isotope; hydrogen isotope; metabolism; oxygen isotope; stable isotope; sulfur isotope; water quality; aqueous solution; aquifer; Article; atmospheric pressure; concentration (parameter); evolution; fractionation; freshwater environment; kinetic isotope effect; partial pressure; pH; recycling; Texas; zonation; Edwards Aquifer; Texas; United States",Article,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85105619798

Here, we holistically quantify the surface- and subsurface- water resources dynamics over three moderate-to-severely water-stressed river basins in Peninsular India, namely, the Godavari, Krishna, and Mahanadi river basins. For the first time, we jointly assimilate GRACE data, PCR-GLOBWB simulation, and in-situ groundwater observations. A comprehensive comparison of decadal trends of terrestrial water storage (TWS) and its constituent components in three basins reveal a stable annual cycle and minimal trends during the period from July 2002 to June 2010, and declining trends of TWS, soil moisture storage (SMS) and groundwater storage (GWS) during the period from July 2010 to June 2017. In particular, Krishna River Basin experienced the largest decrease in TWS and GWS with −30.95 mm yr−1 and −20.18 mm yr−1, respectively. The analysis of water storage deficits well captures the influence of meteorological droughts in the region. It shows that the groundwater extractions primarily govern the water availability during these dry phases. GRACE-derived GWS anomalies and those obtained from the in-situ data are in good agreement (r ≥ 0.86, RMSE ≤ 65 mm, ρ≥ 0.85), depicting the profound applicability of satellite observation in quantifying basin-wide water resources. We further isolate the impact of climatic variability and human interventions on TWS anomaly trends by comparing output derived from GRACE and PCR-GLOBWB-no human intervention (NHI) model runs. The results depict that the human interventions account for 61.29%, 76.12%, and 44.76% of TWS trends in three basins.
