[No author name available],[No author id available],"Recovering hydrogen biofuel from wet-biowaste",2018,"Emerging Technologies in Clean Energy 2018 - Topical Conference at the 2018 AIChE Spring Meeting and 14th Global Congress on Process Safety",,,,"21","22",,,,"https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85095793105&partnerID=40&md5=35e18d98d0262fd37e881127ce73b6ee",,"","Problems with hydrogen and biofuel: Most fossil-based hydrogen is produced by steam methane reforming (SMR) and renewable hydrogen from the electrolysis of water. Without considering plant efficiency, capital or operating costs, hydrogen from SMR has a minimum value of 1.45 times the price of methane, a valuable and resource-limited commodity. In addition, for every ton of hydrogen produced, 10 ton of greenhouse-gas carbon dioxide is coproduced and released from the feedstock and in processing. The electrolysis of water requires a clean, pure feedstock and requires considerably more energy than what hydrogen will produce when reacted with oxygen (air). In contrast to inorganic hydrogen production as described above, organic biofuels are produced by anaerobic digestion and fermentation, which are proven and well-established technologies. Anaerobic digestion uses decaying organic material to produce a syngas where there is waste that needs disposal, or significant subsidies for using energy crops. Fermentation has been producing alcohol beverages for thousands of years from cultivated crops, now it's used to produce subsidized ethanol from corn and sugar, impacting feed and food costs. To quiet the ""food vs. fuel"" debate, effort is now directed at cultivating algae and grass feedstock. Cultivation requires fossil-fuel for planting, fertilizing, harvesting, transporting and distillation of product, which without subsidies would be highly unprofitable. Anaerobic digestion and fermentation both use biological microorganisms ('bugs'), which are temperature dependent, require large volumes with slow rates &amp; low-yields, and are prone to contamination (sulfur) or conditions (temperature) that kills the 'bugs' employed to do the work. In addition, conventional biofuel producers must pay for crop feedstocks whereas biowaste producers pay for biowaste disposal; yet, biowaste has higher energy content than crop feedstocks. An alternative, recovering hydrogen biofuel from wet-biowaste: In the U.S., waste-water treatment plants (WWTP), municipal solid waste, confined area feeding operations, and agriculture produce over 1 billion tons of organic biowaste annually that can cost from $40-$200 per ton to treat before use or disposal. In addition, the amount and cost is increasing. Fuel and electricity represent a substantial cost to WWTPs; one is required for nearly all stages in the treatment process, from the collection of raw sewage to the discharge of treated effluent. An estimated 3-4% of total U.S. electricity consumption is used for the transfer and treatment of wastewater, corresponding to more than 45 million tons of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions annually. WWTP in the U.S. produced 7.9 million tons of sewage biowaste in 2014. The latent energy in this biowaste could meet 12% of the nation's electricity demand. A 10 million gallon/day WWTP producing 7 tons/day of biowaste will require 11 to 17 MWhe of electricity daily. In addition, due to water shortages, higher energy &amp; capital costs and a changing climate, water-energy issues are of growing importance in biowaste management at WWTP. In contrast to being a public energy, economic and environmental burden, Chemergy's patented HyBrTec technology allows WWTPs to be energy independent and profitable producers of thermal energy and renewable fuel. All organic biowaste contains an unused remnant of stored solar energy that HyBrTec recovers as renewable hydrogen, non-anthropogenic carbon dioxide, thermal energy and inorganic residuals suitable as a micro-nutrient fertilizer. Processing wet-biowaste, HyBrTec exploits two well-established steps that are scalable from pounds to tons per minute with commercially available components. First, the wet-biowaste (C6H10O5&amp; H2O) is eburnedf or oxidized with bromine (Br2) to produce hydrogen bromide (HBr), carbon dioxide (CO2) and heat (C6H10O5+ 7H2O + 12Br2← 24HBr + 6CO2). The HBr reacts with unreacted water forming concentrated hydrobromic acid (HBraq). Bromination is followed by electrolysis of the hydrobromic acid into hydrogen (H2) and reagent Br2 and dilute acid that is recycled back into the process. Hydrogen bromide electrochemistry is reversible (2HBr ← H2+ Br2) allowing the charging (storing) and discharging (production) of electrical energy. This enables a HyBrTec reversible electrolysis system to co-provide efficient electrical energy storage. The hydrogen-bromine energy storage system operates as a flow battery where the reactants are stored outside the electrochemical PEM stack, which simplifies capacity growth. Energy storage increases the value of off-peak and intermittent solar &amp; wind energy and promotes development of micro- and smartgrids that can exploit local sources of energy, improve efficiency, reduce needed capacity and mitigate disruptions. Feedstocks include: sewage, manure, agricultural residuals, and municipal solid waste including plastics. Also, wastewater is a reagent in the process producing additional hydrogen. Unique to HyBrTec is that 175-200 C heat (26.3 kWhth/kgH2) is released, which can be used to reduce the feedstock water content to a desired 50%. Also, electroosmotic water transfer from the bromine anode to the hydrogen cathode increases the acid concentration at the anode, which lowers cell voltage and results in 4-6 gallons of potable water per kgH2. If the residual energy content of the biowaste is omitted, HyBrTec offers a theoretical biowaste-to-hydrogen-to-energy efficiency greater than 100%. This is simply because the theoretical voltage to dissociate hydrogen carrier hydrogen bromide into hydrogen and bromine (0.58 Volt) is less than the voltage produced in the hydrogen reaction with oxygen (1.23 Volt) forming water, providing a theoretical biowaste-to-energy efficiency of 212% (1.23V/0.58V). However, if the electrolyzer operates at an actual 0.75-0.8 Volts (16-21.23 kWh/kgH2 depending on electrolyte temperature) the efficiency is 154%, and if the hydrogen is used in a 65% efficient fuel cell with air the electric-to-electric efficiency is reduced further to 100%. The efficiencies above disregard the latent energy content of the negative-valued feedstock; however, if included the biowaste-to-electricity efficiency is a healthy 67%. Hydrogen can enrich natural gas to increase its Btu content and reduce NOx emissions, used directly as a clean fuel or sold as a commodity. Furthermore, byproduct carbon dioxide is organic in origin and not considered a GHG, can be vented, or used with recovered hydrogen to synthesize methanol, ethanol or methane using Fischer-Tropsch or the Audi e-gas process. Also, recovered hydrogen can be combined with nitrogen from on-site membrane air-separation to produce ammonia, which is a higher-value commodity and easily transportable. Other opportunities to monetize the carbon dioxide byproduct include reacting with ammonia to produce even higher value urea. Beginning in 2010 the U.S. Department of Energy and the Florida Hydrogen Initiative funded laboratory bench-top R&amp;D of HyBrTec. Based on the success of this research and at the recommendation of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL), the California Energy Commission (CEC) in 2013 funded Chemergy in a cost-shared program to determine suitability of biosolids from the Delta Diablo WWTP, prepare a detailed system design &amp; cost estimate of a demonstration system and an economic analysis of a HyBrTec commercial system. The results of the CEC program verified that 21.44 kg of hydrogen could be produced per wet-ton of sewage sludge and providing a 95% reduction of the wet-mass. An economic analysis for a small system processing 11 wet-tons of sewage sludge per day into 236 kg of hydrogen predicted a hydrogen production cost of $2/kg and a 14% Internal Rate of Return. Economic benefits from an increased scale, energy storage, state &amp; federal renewable energy tax incentives, loan guarantees, cap &amp; trade credits and subsidies were not included in the analysis, which if taken would increase the IRR. © Emerging Technologies in Clean Energy 2018 -.All rights reserved.",,"Agricultural robots; Ammonia; Anaerobic digestion; Anodes; Biofuels; Bromine; Bromine compounds; Carbon dioxide; Carbon dioxide process; Cost benefit analysis; Cost estimating; Crops; Cultivation; Distillation; Earnings; Economic analysis; Effluent treatment; Effluents; Electric discharges; Electric energy storage; Electric power utilization; Electrolysis; Electrolytes; Energy efficiency; Environmental technology; Ethanol; Feedstocks; Fermentation; Fertilizers; Fossil fuels; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Hydroelectric power plants; Hydrogen storage; Inorganic acids; Methane; Municipal solid waste; Natural gasoline plants; Operating costs; Organic carbon; Oxygen; Patents and inventions; Potable water; Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC); Reagents; Recovery; Sewage sludge; Solar energy; Springs (components); Steam reforming; Taxation; Thermal energy; Urea; Wastewater disposal; Wastewater treatment; Water treatment; Wind power; Anthropogenic carbon dioxide; Biological microorganisms; California energy commissions; Electrical energy storages; Hydrogen production costs; Lawrence livermore national laboratories; U.S. Department of Energy; Wastewater treatment plants; Hydrogen production",Conference Paper,"Final","",Scopus,2-s2.0-85095793105

This shift is integral to Jemena's success in the New South Wales (NSW) natural gas distribution market, where natural gas retail prices are rising as a result of steadily increasing wholesale gas prices and residential consumption is declining at a household level. Like the rest of the world, Australia is moving towards a low carbon future, with the Federal Government committing Australia to reducing Australia to reducing carbon emissions by 26%-28% between 2005 and 2030. State governments have committed to more ambitious targets with the NSW Government committing to a target of net-zero carbon emissions for the state by 2050. This means that Jemena must work to reposition natural gas as part of Australia's renewable energy future, to both ensure that it has a role in Australia's renewable energy future and that its energy products remain attractive and relevant to its customers. Jemena is working on a number of strategic initiatives that will enable its natural gas distribution network to remain commercially viable in a low carbon future. These include technology projects such as a Power to Gas pilot and a gas microgeneration trials, that together will demonstrate the value and role of gas and the gas network in a net-zero carbon economy. © 27th World Gas Conference, WGC 2018.

They have gas-like as well as liquid-like properties. In recent years, many attempts had been made to apply the supercritical fluids as alternative solvents and/or reactants. Among these fluids, supercritical water, carbon dioxide and alcohols (methanol and ethanol) have been attracting much attention from their environmentally benign, chemically stable natures. In particular, from its low critical conditions, non reactive and non-toxic natures, and the low price, supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO such as extraction, drying, polymer processing, and particle synthesis. To design these processes, physical properties of the solvents are the essential. A physical property measurement under high pressure requires specialized apparatus and takes up much time. Therefore, limited numbers of data were reported. Since many processes are mixture systems, the physical properties data of mixtures under high pressure are also required. However, from the stand points of cost as well as time, to measure all of the data is impossible. Thus, establishment of the estimation method with a high accuracy is inevitable. With the use of the equation of state (EoS), it is possible to calculate not only the PVT relationship but also the thermodynamic quantities such as chemical potential, entropy, and isothermal compressibility. In fact, many kinds of the EoS are used in the various process simulators. One of the most important data referred in the simulators related to the EoS are the interaction parameters. They are that correct the differences between different molecules, and are determined from the physical property data of the mixtures. Among the physical properties of mixtures, density is particularly sensitive to the mixing. Thus, establishing the method that can be express the density well will result in to improve the estimation accuracy of the physic-chemical properties of the mixtures. In this work, to investigate the effects of determination procedure of the interaction parameters on the density estimation, the densities of CO2/ethylbenzene (C2H5C6H5) and CO2/cyclohexane (C6H12) systems were measured as model systems, and widely used Peng-Robinson equation of state (PR EoS)1) was employed as the EoS. More specifically, the interaction parameters were determined from the vapor-liquid equilibrium (VLE) data, from the density, and from the excess molar volume, separately, and with thus determined interaction three sets of parameters, the densities of mixtures were prediction, and the accuracies were discussed. In this study, the density of mixtures was measured with a high pressure vibration type density meter equipped with a circulation pump and a variable volume viewing cell. The calibration of the density meter was conducted with water and C6H12. The measurement was conducted at temperatures from 313.15 to 353.15 K and pressures up to 20 MPa. CO2 compositions were changed from 0 (pure C2H5C6H5 or C6H12) to 80 mol%. At low CO2 compositions, the density of the CO2/C2H5C6H5 system increased with increasing the CO2 molar fraction. At high CO2 compositions, it decreased and approached the density of CO2. Similar tendency was observed for the CO2/C6H12 system. These tendencies could be explained as follows: at low CO2 compositions, penetration of the CO2 into between organic molecules makes mixture dense. On the other hand, at high CO2 compositions, organic molecules were surrounded by the CO2, and the properties of the CO2 became dominant. Three sets of interaction parameters were determined by correlating the VLE data in the literature2)3), the experimentally obtained density, and the excess molar volume calculated from the experimentally obtained density and the pure component density, with the PR EoS minimizing Average Absolute Relative Deviation (AARD). In the calculation, the van der Waals one fluid model4) was used for the mixing rule. In the mixing rule, there are two interaction parameters, kij and lij. The density was estimated from these three parameter sets, and the prediction accuracy was compared. In the case of the correlation with the VLE data, the interaction parameters, kij, lij and the correlation error were 0.12, -0.13 and 0.57 %, respectively, for the CO2/C2H5C6H5 system, and 0.16, -0.17 and 1.06 %, respectively, for the CO2/C6H12 system. The prediction errors of the density with the obtained parameters were relatively large, 5.54 % and 6.84 % for (CO2/C2H5C6H5 system) and (CO2/C6H12 system), respectively. In addition, the estimated density behavior against CO2 molar fraction was different from the experimental behavior, and monotonously decreased with the increase in the CO2 composition. In the case of the correlation with the density, kij, lij and the correlation error were 0.06, -0.02 and 0.60 %, respectively, for the CO2/C2H5C6H5 system, and -0.16, -0.15 and 1.79 %, respectively, for the CO2/C6H12 system. These results were a bit better from the results using the parameters determined from the VLE data. The density behavior against CO2 molar fraction of the CO2/C2H5C6H5 system could be expressed well though, that of CO2/C6H12 system is still hard to be expressed. We speculate that these tendencies could be explained from the prediction accuracy of the density of the pure components, C6H12 and C2H5C6H5. The prediction accuracies of the pure C2H5C6H5 and C6H12 were 1.06 % (313.15 K, 1~20 MPa) and 5.48 % (313.15 K, 1~20 MPa), respectively. This was not a problem of the interaction parameters but a problem of the parameter representing pure substances (in the case of the PR EoS, they are the critical values and the acentric factor). With the parameters, the VLE was predicted. The prediction errors were 8.89 % and 281 % for CO2/C2H5C6H5 system and CO2/C6H12 system, respectively. It was not possible to estimate the VLE data for CO2/C6H12 system. In the case of the correlation with the excess molar volume, the interaction parameters, kij, lij and the correlation error were 0.11, -0.04 and 10.8 %, respectively for the CO2/C2H5C6H5 system, and 0.13, -0.04 and 17.3 %, respectively for the CO2/C6H12 system. The density prediction errors with these parameters were 5.54 % and 6.84 % for CO2/C2H5C6H5 system and CO2/C6H12 system, respectively. At the same time, with these parameters, the density behavior against CO2 molar fraction of both systems could be well expressed (AARD was 2.88 % and 3.14% for CO2/C2H5C6H5 and CO2/C6H12 system, respectively). In addition, the VLE prediction error with these parameters were 8.73 % and 6.82 % for CO2/C2H5C6H5 system and CO2/C6H12 system, respectively. It was possible to estimate the VLE data for not only CO2/C2H5C6H5 system but also CO2/C6H12 system. Therefore, in the estimation of the VLE data, it was found that the density change behavior was important. These facts suggest that when estimate the physic-chemical properties, use of the fitting parameters determined on the same physical base (in this case, excess molar volume and density) is the important factor. In conclusion, interaction parameters obtained by correlating the excess molar volume could be express not only the density, but also the VLE, and have the possibility to be applicable to calculate the other physical properties for mixtures.
